But the Internet is changing that -- so profoundly, in fact, that the Federal Communications Commission is now rethinking even the definition of the word ''channel.''

Early Wednesday, Coach Joe Paterno was still calling his own shots, as if his moral authority had somehow survived the tsunami of a scandal fueled by his own inaction. When the Board of Trustees did the right thing Wednesday night -- and really, firing Paterno and Graham B. Spanier, the university president, was the only thing it could do -- the Paterno cult of personality tried to strike back. Students protested, clinging to the mythic hero they did not want unmasked.

Abrams, a skater himself, made two trips the following year to photograph what turned out to be a small but thriving skating scene in the war-torn city, in part the work of Skateistan, a school started in 2007 by two Australian skaters. (A documentary film about the program, ""Skateistan: To Live and Skate Kabul,"" had its premiere at Sundance this year.) Overcoming a lack of smooth roads and sidewalks, among other things, Kabul's skaters - girls included - find in skating a rare recreational outlet, Abrams says. ""The mullahs have no problem with girls skating. They can't ride a bike, but they can skate. The girls just jump on it."" Here, Abrams's diary of his weeks in Kabul, above, and a Times video on ""Skateistan,"" below."

There is Mr. Clinton, in 1969, on ''Say Brother,'' a television show produced by WGBH in Boston. (This is early Clinton, even before Funkadelic's first album; the Parliaments would soon become Funkadelic.) He is wearing a purple jumpsuit with crossed suspenders over bare shoulders and a kind of rounded Mohawk, a shaved band of scalp below a bulbous crown of hair.
