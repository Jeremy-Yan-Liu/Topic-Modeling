During that time, I remember how I seemed to be always waiting, like the Red Sox fan that I am, for next year. We dealers hung in there by selling service and used cars, repeatedly investing in training and in upgraded facilities, despite minimal or no returns from the new-model side.

2007-01-28	BIG NEWS	To the American auto industry's injuries, you can add this insult from Automotive News, the influential trade publication. It has buried ''The Big Three'' as shorthand for General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. With Toyota now No. 3 in domestic sales, No. 2 worldwide and gaining ground on the No. 1 maker, G.M., ''when you say 'Big Three,' you would be universally misunderstood,'' said David Sedgwick, editor of Automotive News.

Since Toyota brought that model to the United States six years ago, the company has basked in a green public-relations glow -- even though Honda was first with a modern gas-electric car (the Insight) and Ford sold the first hybrid S.U.V. (the Escape). But with a mix of creative engineering, clever promotion and fortunate timing, Toyota has set the de facto standard for the entire class of eco-friendly vehicles. It has licensed its software to Ford and is selling hybrid components to Nissan. Toyota has half a dozen hybrid models in showrooms or on the way -- twice as many as any other automaker -- ranging from the miserly Prius to the $100,000-plus Lexus LS 600hL.

People involved in planning the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the high level of the talks, said it would focus on three areas: energy and the environment; costs like pensions and health care premiums that add hundreds of dollars to the price of a Detroit car; and how currency issues affect the Japanese automakers.

A sharp drop at General Motors helped push down auto sales nationwide in March, despite pitches from American carmakers for consumers to take advantage of the latest deals. G.M.'s ''March Madness'' promotion did little to end the skid in sales, while incentives at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler also seemed to do little to lift overall results.

Should it surprise anyone that DaimlerChrysler is once again trying to exhume the body and breathe new life into it? At the Detroit auto show in January, Chrysler unveiled a concept car -- a design study intended to elicit public reaction -- that hinted at a possible styling direction for a new Imperial. Even within the tight clique of Imperial flame-keepers, there was disagreement over the brash design. Some traditionalists were aghast at the car's proportions; others were charmed by its haughty presence.

Chrysler also said that it expected to cut 10 percent to 15 percent of its 14,900 salaried jobs in the United States, or up to 2,235 positions, as part of a plan by its parent company, DaimlerChrysler, to eliminate 6,000 jobs worldwide through 2008.
2006-03-12	Thanks to Detroit, China Is Poised to Lead	VOLKSWAGEN and other carmakers used to prosper by sending outdated factory equipment to China to produce older models no longer salable in the West. But competition has become so fierce here that Honda is about to introduce its latest version of the Civic only several months after it went on sale in Europe, Japan and the United States. Toyota, meanwhile, is assembling its Prius gasoline-electric sedan only in Japan and China. When Ford Motor opened its first production line here in western China just three years ago, it used a layout copied from a Ford factory in the Philippines to produce 20,000 sedans a year based on a small car design taken from Ford operations in India.

The payments, it said, could violate both German law and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States.
2006-03-04	Chrysler's Goal: Keep Success but Lose Incentives	By all rights, Chrysler should be celebrating its status as the most successful Detroit automaker.

2006-03-02	Both Ford And G.M. Scale Back	Both General Motors and Ford said Wednesday they would scale back production in the second quarter, a move that reflects their falling sales and shrinking market share in the United States. As has been the case for much of the last year, Asian automakers' sales grew steadily last month. Honda's sales rose the most, with an 8.7 percent increase. Toyota, which has become accustomed to double-digit monthly gains, had a more modest 2.4 percent increase last month.

2006-02-19	Editors' Note	An article on Feb. 5 about changes in the American auto market contrasted its two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford, with the next four -- Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. It said that while those four were expected to have a combined worldwide profit of $22 billion for 2005, G.M. and Ford together had a loss of $6.6 billion worldwide. The article should have noted that G.M. reported a loss of $8.6 billion while Ford reported an overall profit of $2 billion, although Ford lost $1.6 billion from its North American auto operations.
2006-02-17	Daimler Profit Jumped 12%, Thanks To Chrysler	When Chrysler hit rocky times earlier this decade, Mercedes's strength helped prop up their parent, DaimlerChrysler. Now Chrysler has returned the favor. DaimlerChrysler said Thursday that it earned $3.3 billion in 2005, up about 12 percent from 2004. But its shares fell nearly 4 percent after the company declined to give a specific forecast for 2006.

Last week at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Mr. LaSorda hugged writers, photographers, engineers, video producers, members of Chrysler's public relations staff -- and, one hopes, Mrs. LaSorda.
2006-01-10	Detroit's Hollywood on Wheels; Chrysler's Grand Entrance to the Auto Show? Exiting With a Bang	For General Motors and Ford, this year's Detroit auto show comes at a moment of gloom. The two companies are losing market share and money in the United States, and workers' benefits are being cut. Not so for Chrysler, the only American automaker with sales that rose in 2005. On Monday, Chrysler showed off its muscle, as well as its cars, and overshadowed its hometown rivals with one of its trademark Hollywood-style productions. Its chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, rode in the passenger seat of the redesigned Jeep Wrangler as it burst out of a giant ivy-covered cage (a blatant rip-off of the movie ''King Kong''). The Jeep drove off the main stage, down the center aisle of the auto show and then smashed through a plate glass window at the Cobo Convention Center. There was a collective gasp from thousands of people watching the rest of its journey on a big television screen.
2006-01-08	Is There a Future In Ford's Future?	MARK FIELDS has no time to waste -- and no time to become acquainted with employees at Ford Motor, where he is the new president of its American operations. That is why Mr. Fields, who recently returned to Ford's headquarters here in October after three promotions that had taken him to Argentina, Japan and England in the last eight years, has been firing off ''Dear Team'' e-mail messages to employees, outlining the steps that he thinks the company needs to take, and serving as host for internal Webcasts.
2005-12-22	Daimler Settles U.S. Charges	The DaimlerChrysler Corporation agreed to spend $90 million to fix defective emission controls on 1.5 million vehicles and pay a $1 million penalty to settle charges that it failed to report the problem to regulators, the Justice Department said yesterday. The settlement, which involves Jeep and Dodge vehicles from the 1996 through 2001 model years, is the largest involving a failure to report defective emission-control devices to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Justice Department said.
2005-12-17	8,500 Jobs to Be Cut at Mercedes in Germany	In a close vote Friday, the supervisory board of DaimlerChrysler approved a cost-cutting plan that will eliminate at least 8,500 jobs at Mercedes-Benz factories in Germany by 2008. Though the far-reaching plan was approved, 8 of the 10 employee representatives on the 20-member board voted against it. They said it relied too heavily on job losses, even if the reductions will be achieved through voluntary buyouts.
2005-12-04	Engines Go Back to the Future	GERMAN automakers gave up pushrod engines long ago, in favor of more complex overhead-cam power plants. The Japanese have essentially quit making the old-design engines. Ford is down to just a couple. But Chrysler, with seven, and especially General Motors, with about a dozen in 21 different forms, remain bastions of the pushrod engine, also known as an overhead-valve design.
2005-11-22	G.M. SET TO DROP 5,000 MORE JOBS AND SHUT PLANTS	General Motors, the world's largest auto company, announced details on Monday of a three-year blueprint to revive its fortunes, including 5,000 job cuts on top of 25,000 previously announced. Analysts immediately questioned whether the plan was enough, saying it lacked the speed and breadth that had helped rivals make comebacks. Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said the jobs cuts along with plant closings were ''necessary for G.M. to get its costs in line with our major global competitors.''
2005-11-06	He Still Speaks German, But With a Motown Accent	DIETER ZETSCHE is not just one of the half-dozen most powerful people in the auto industry. He's also a ham -- a wiry fellow with twinkling eyes and a walrus mustache who once pulverized a glass wall with an electric guitar to unveil a new model at a car show. When Mr. Zetsche returned to his native Germany this fall after nearly five years running the Chrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., one might have thought that the time for such antics was past. After all, Mr. Zetsche, a 52-year-old engineer, had just been promoted to chairman of Chrysler's parent, DaimlerChrysler, arguably the most prestigious post in corporate Germany.
2005-11-02	Big Drop In October For Detroit	October, which is the start of the new model year, used to be a month for the auto industry to celebrate. This year, it was a month for Detroit to forget. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler held their lowest shares of the American market ever last month. Sales fell in the wake of high gasoline prices, fears about the economy and consumer resistance to buying cars without the big discounts the companies offered this summer.
2005-10-26	DaimlerChrysler Profit Falls; Sales Improve in 2 Divisions	DaimlerChrysler reported on Tuesday that its third-quarter profit dropped by more than one-fifth even as business steadily improved at both its Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz divisions. The automaker, which is based in Stuttgart, Germany, attributed its weakened performance to increased income tax expenses. In the third quarter last year, its net income grew because of a one-time tax-exempt sale of its stake in Hyundai, the Korean automaker. Without that cash cushion this year, Daimler's earnings fell 21 percent, to $910 million, or 755 million euros.
2005-10-26	German Labor's New Reality	Hartmut Meine's office here overlooks an old graveyard. It is a fitting view for a man who is waging a twilight battle to keep his 114-year-old labor union viable, as global competition threatens to undo half a century of rights and privileges won by millions of German workers. In the last month, Mr. Meine's union, IG Metall, has reached three wage deals with Volkswagen. In each case, VW demanded -- and won -- significant concessions, partly by threatening to move the production of one car to Portugal, where hourly wages are less than a third of those in Germany.
2005-10-20	In the Hybrid's Wake, Trying to Catch Up	At the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota unveiled a futuristic car powered by a gasoline-electric engine that sounded part Jetsons, part Star Trek. With this so-called hybrid engine under the hood, the concept car was called the Prius. Fast forward to Wednesday's opening of the 2005 Motor Show. America's Big Three auto makers -- Ford Motor, General Motors and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler -- were deploying slinky models to drape themselves over concept cars running in some kind of alternative fashion: hydrogen fuel cells or gasoline-electric engines.
2005-10-18	G.M. AND UNION IN A DEAL TO CUT HEALTH BENEFITS	General Motors said on Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the United Automobile Workers union to cut $1 billion in annual health care benefits for more than 750,000 blue-collar workers, retirees and their families as part of an effort to climb out of a financial crisis. ''This is a very big step forward that we will build on,'' said Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. He called it ''the single biggest cost reduction that we've probably been able to announce in a single day in the history of G.M.''
2005-10-10	With Delphi Filing, Tougher Times for Auto Industry Workers	When Delphi, the nation's largest auto supplier, filed for bankruptcy on Saturday, it was the latest blow to the American auto worker's gilded age. Ninety-one years ago, Henry Ford shocked corporate America by abruptly announcing that he would roughly double his workers' average wages, to $5 a day. For the first time, many Ford line workers could afford the Model T's they were assembling.
2005-09-29	New Austerity for German Car Industry	The German auto industry, saddled with some of the highest labor costs in the world, is embarking on a stringent belt-tightening campaign, prodded by a pair of German ex-colleagues who made their names with an even tougher austerity drive in the United States. DaimlerChrysler said on Wednesday that it would cut 8,500 jobs in Germany within the next year. A day earlier, Volkswagen said that it would build a new sport utility vehicle at its main plant in Wolfsburg rather than in Portugal -- but only after extracting a 20 percent wage reduction from its workers.
2005-09-28	Supreme Court to Determine Fate of Business Tax Credits	The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether a popular tax credit, which most states use to encourage businesses to make capital investments, violates the Constitution. The case is an appeal by the State of Ohio and the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, which received an Ohio investment tax credit for building a Jeep plant in a depressed area of Toledo, of a court ruling that a benefit of this type interferes unconstitutionally with interstate commerce.
2005-09-21	Auto Workers And Chrysler Reach Deal In Canada	Reflecting the struggling state of North American automakers, the Canadian Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement with DaimlerChrysler Canada early Tuesday that eliminates about 1,600 jobs and offers only limited wage and benefit gains. The Canadian arm of the Chrysler Group avoided a strike scheduled to start Tuesday night by abandoning a plan to contract out several services, including trucking, as well as closing a casting plant in Toronto. Those moves, the union said, would have eliminated 2,500 jobs.
2005-09-20	Automaker and Canadian Union Near Pact	DaimlerChrysler Canada and the Canadian Auto Workers appeared to be close to an agreement Monday, reducing the possibility that the automaker will be shut by a strike Tuesday night. The union's Canadian president, Buzz Hargrove, said late Monday afternoon that the two sides were close enough ''that we can conclude an agreement with DaimlerChrysler sometime this evening.''
2005-09-17	Chrysler Aims to Outdo Ford In Canadian Labor Talks	DaimlerChrysler Canada is seeking greater concessions from workers than Ford obtained in its labor settlement this week, the head of the Canadian Auto Workers said Friday. ''They're being tougher than nails,'' Buzz Hargrove, president of the union, said from Toronto, where negotiations are taking place. The union has set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.
2005-09-08	Three Automakers Plan Alliance to Develop a Hybrid Car	BMW, the world's largest luxury carmaker, will join General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to develop fuel-saving gasoline-electric power systems to try to catch up with the hybrid leader, Toyota. BMW intends to have an agreement with G.M. and DaimlerChrysler later this year, the companies said yesterday. G.M. and DaimlerChrysler said in December that they would develop hybrids to offer better fuel economy and create fewer emissions than conventional gasoline engines. They signed a deal on Aug. 22.
2005-09-03	Chrysler Discounts Will End in October	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler will end employee discounts for all buyers on Oct. 3 and does not plan to match General Motors and Ford Motor by extending the deals to 2006 models, the company said yesterday. ''We're looking for September to be a very big clearance month as we end our employee pricing on Oct. 3,'' Chrysler's sales chief, Gary Dilts, said yesterday on a conference call with analysts and reporters.
2005-08-27	U.S. Denies a Tax Deduction To Foreign-Based Companies	DaimlerChrysler, BP and other international companies that let American employees purchase shares under a stock ownership plan cannot claim tax deductions for dividends paid on those shares, the United States Treasury Department has ruled. The department, in regulations released Thursday, said only the parent company could claim the deduction, which is useless to non-United States companies that pay taxes in their home countries.
2005-08-24	Daimler and Volkswagen Planning a Minivan	Germany's two largest carmakers, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler, are in advanced talks about jointly building a new minivan for the American market, executives at the companies said Tuesday. The deal, likely to be announced next month at the Frankfurt auto show, would give Volkswagen a major lift in its effort to turn around its dismal fortunes in the United States. It would also increase production at DaimlerChrysler's two North American plants that make minivans.
2005-08-19	Mercedes Boss, Leaving Early, Will Yield to Daimler Chief	Eckhard Cordes, the Mercedes division chief who last month lost the race to head DaimlerChrysler, will resign at the end of the month, the automaker announced on Thursday. Dieter Zetsche, the incoming chief executive, will take personal control of the troubled group. Mr. Cordes, who offered to leave on July 28 -- soon after the early departure of the current chief executive, Jürgen E. Schrempp, was announced -- will be succeeded on Sept. 1 by Mr. Zetsche, Daimler, based in Stuttgart, said in a brief statement. Mr. Cordes, 54, ''will leave the company at his own request,'' the statement said.
2005-08-18	Germany Investigates Trading Of DaimlerChrysler Shares	Germany's securities regulator has opened an investigation into possible insider trading in shares of DaimlerChrysler, which increased in price before the formal announcement that its chief executive, Jürgen E. Schrempp, would resign. The inquiry, which is expected to last weeks, will comb through data that brokerage firms provide daily to BaFin, as the regulator is known, said Sabine Reimer, a spokeswoman.
2005-08-13	Chrysler's New Chief Unravels Himself From Union Roots	For a man whose union ties run three generations deep, it was an odd place to be. But sure enough, there was Thomas W. LaSorda, the incoming chief executive of Chrysler, standing in front of about 1,000 Mexican employees at a truck assembly plant here and praising them.
2005-08-12	Chrysler Predicts New Models Will Lead to Higher Profits	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler will post higher profits this year and next as it introduces new models and lifts sales outside North America, the incoming Chrysler chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, said yesterday. Profit this year will rise slightly from 2004 and increase again next year when the automaker introduces at least 10 new models, the most ever for Chrysler in a year, Mr. LaSorda said in an interview. Chrysler had operating profit of $1.9 billion last year, the most since 1999, helped by sales of cars like its Chrysler 300 sedan.
2005-08-06	S.E.C. Inquiry Latest Problem For Daimler	When DaimlerChrysler's chief executive, Jürgen E. Schrempp, threw his company into flux last week by announcing that he would step down earlier than planned, his top executives reacted in a characteristically European way: they went on vacation. When they get back to work, they will have to deal with a passel of problems, including further management upheaval and a widening investigation into corruption at the flagship Mercedes division.
2005-08-03	Another Exit Seems Likely In DaimlerChrysler Drama	Eckhard Cordes, the head of the Mercedes car group who was passed over for the top job at DaimlerChrysler last week, sold 3.66 million euros ($4.46 million) in company stock, the clearest sign yet that he is likely to leave the automaker, analysts said. Dieter Zetsche, who turned around the money-losing Chrysler division, was selected last week to succeed Jürgen E. Schrempp to lead DaimlerChrysler, essentially scuttling Mr. Cordes's shot at the chief executive post for the immediate future.
2005-08-02	2 Carmakers Trim Prices, But Rebates May Shrink	General Motors and Ford may be slowly backing away from a longstanding Detroit practice: inflating the price tags on cars and then offering big rebates to sweeten the deal. In the latest escalation of the price war among the Big Three American automakers, G.M. and Ford said Monday that they would cut the sticker prices on a few dozen of their new cars and trucks, in some cases by thousands of dollars. That could mean smaller and fewer discounts and other incentives that consumers have grown to expect when they buy an American car.
2005-07-29	Shake-Up at DaimlerChrysler; Incoming Chief Led Turnaround	Jürgen E. Schrempp, the embattled German auto titan who created a trans-Atlantic carmaker but spent years defending his trouble-prone empire, will step down as the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler at the end of 2005, more than two years earlier than planned. The company said that Dieter Zetsche, a popular, well-regarded executive who turned around the money-losing Chrysler division, would succeed Mr. Schrempp as chief executive. Mr. Zetsche's deputy, Thomas W. LaSorda, who is Canadian, will take over the Chrysler division.
2005-07-19	Iacocca, Away From the Grind, Still Has a Lot to Say	Lee A. Iacocca is back and still shooting from the hip. After remaining silent during Detroit's recent doldrums, Mr. Iacocca, the 80-year-old former Chrysler chairman, is talking about cars again and even promoting Chrysler's cars in three new commercials. In an interview on Monday, the man who once pulled Chrysler from the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1980's offered his views on the domestic industry and its weakest giant, General Motors.
2005-07-07	As the Going Gets Tough, Chrysler Calls on Its Old Pitchman	Chrysler is bringing back Lee A. Iacocca to do what he does best -- pitch cars in commercials. At least that is the plan. On Wednesday, Chrysler executives said a deal was being negotiated with Mr. Iacocca, the company's 80-year-old retired chairman, adding that they hoped to have all the details worked out by Thursday. The first of an initial series of three commercials has already been shot. And yes, it will feature Mr. Iacocca's classic line from his commercials of another era -- ''If you can find a better car, buy it'' -- though it will be read by the other star of the first commercial, the actor Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame.
2005-06-23	A U.A.W. Chief Awaits a G.M. Showdown	As a negotiator, Ron Gettelfinger, the United Automobile Workers president, is known more for the carrot than the stick. Just don't mistake him for easygoing. This year, he briefly banned marines stationed near Solidarity House, the union's headquarters, from parking in the union lot if they drove foreign cars or had Bush bumper stickers. And in 2001, shortly after being nominated for the union presidency, he summed up his style in one word: ''abrasive.''
2005-06-22	Shifting Michigan Southward; Foreign Automakers, Settled in South, Set Industry's Pace	By most accounts, the United States auto industry is in deep trouble. But don't tell that to the newest workers here in Alabama, where foreign carmakers are redefining the auto industry in America. Automakers from overseas first began building manufacturing plants in this country in the 1970's, largely as a defensive response to protectionist threats. But even as General Motors and Ford have been announcing thousands of job cuts, the foreign automakers are aggressively building new factories and expanding plants they opened not long ago.
2005-06-12	What Women Want: More Horses	DIANE NOEL DIRIENZO and her friend Sharon Fitzpatrick have a lot in common. They live on the same street in Milford, Conn. They are both mothers as well as busy professionals, and both found themselves unexpectedly single after many years of marriage. (Ms. Dirienzo was widowed; Ms. Fitzpatrick divorced.) A few weeks ago they both even decided to deal with a sudden bout of midlife ennui in the same way. ''I said, 'Let's go shopping,''' recounted Ms. Dirienzo, a real estate agent. ''Let's really go shopping.'' So they did: specifically for two Mercedes, one apiece. Both wanted a black one -- sexy, elegant. Later that day Ms. Dirienzo, who is 53, signed the contract for a convertible CLK350. Ms. Fitzpatrick, 52 and a nurse, opted for a sleek, nimble E320 sedan. For each, their car was a statement as much as a means of transportation. For too many years, they said, they had let the roles of wife and mother define their purchases: minivans or stodgy family sedans.
2005-05-27	Chrysler and Union Face Crucial Talks in Canada	Overtime is a familiar word to Chrysler workers in Canada, who build the Chrysler 300 sedan, the flagship of Chrysler's recent revival, at a plant near Toronto. And in this city, across a bridge from Detroit, they build a briskly selling crop of minivans known for their two rows of seats that fold flat. So, the stakes are high for Chrysler in summer contract talks with the Canadian Auto Workers union. Executives of Chrysler, a division of the German automaker DaimlerChrysler, contend that their Canadian workers are fast becoming uncompetitive in the global economy. While Canada's nationalized health care helps Chrysler undercut labor costs at its plants in the United States, Canadian workers have in the last three years become more expensive than workers at nonunionized plants in the United States run by Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and other Asian automakers. Chrysler's Canadian workers are aware of both the competitive burdens that the company faces as well as its recent spurt of success. By contrast, both General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are struggling to keep customers and hold onto profits.
2005-05-19	Judge Orders Testimony On Grasso	A New York judge yesterday signed an order seeking the overseas testimony of Jürgen E. Schrempp, the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, as part of the legal effort to force Richard A. Grasso, the former chief of the New York Stock Exchange, to return at least $100 million in pay. Mr. Schrempp was a New York Stock Exchange director from 2000 to 2003 and a member of the compensation committee that set Mr. Grasso's pay. A lawyer for Mr. Grasso told Justice Charles E. Ramos of the State Supreme Court yesterday that Schrempp, who lives in Germany, is ''refusing'' to come to the United States to answer questions about the case.
2005-05-04	DaimlerChrysler Must Pay Kerkorian	While the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian lost his billion-dollar fraud lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler last month, a judge says he is entitled to $556,061 from the company for failing to produce crucial documents until late in the trial in 2003. ''Sanctions are warranted,'' Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. of Federal District Court wrote in his 10-page ruling, which was dated April 20.
2005-05-04	Ford and G.M. Suffer as Buyers Shun S.U.V.'s	The latest automobile sales figures show that Americans are increasingly wary of gas-thirsty sport utility vehicles. That was particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which both saw their sales slip last month as consumers continued their steady march into Asian car companies' dealerships. Both Toyota and Nissan posted record sales gains in April, which helped push overall auto sales in North America up 1.8 percent.
2005-05-03	FORMER CHRYSLER DESIGNER TO BE A FORD DESIGN DIRECTOR	The Ford Motor Company hired a former DaimlerChrysler designer, Freeman Thomas. Mr. Thomas, 47, will join Ford effective June 1 as director of strategic design, a spokeswoman, Jennifer Flake, said. Mr. Thomas, who helped develop the New Beetle for Volkswagen in the 1990's, resigned April 21 from the California studio of Chrysler after six years with the company. Ford said he was on the team that designed Chrysler's popular 300 sedan.
2005-04-29	Its Profit Down 30%, Daimler Still Exceeds Wall St. Forecasts	Heavy losses at its Mercedes unit continued to slow profits at DaimlerChrysler, which said on Thursday that its first-quarter earnings fell by nearly a third. Still, the results surpassed Wall Street expectations. Operating profit at Mercedes, which is saddled with the high cost of revamping the struggling Smart minicar brand, vanished. Mercedes, which was once the main source of profitability for DaimlerChrysler, posted an operating loss of $1.24 billion because of the problems at Smart and declining sales of Mercedes-Benz models. It was the first quarterly operating loss for Mercedes since Daimler-Benz and Chrysler merged in 1998.
2005-04-22	China Looms As the World's Next Leading Auto Exporter	Industrial heartlands from the Great Lakes region to Germany, look out -- here comes the Chinese auto industry. A senior DaimlerChrysler executive, Ruediger Grube, startled a roomful of journalists and his own aides at the Shanghai Auto Show on Thursday by disclosing that the company intended to export small cars from China to the United States. Daimler is already in talks with one of its Chinese joint-venture partners to build a factory for the exports, he said, and would like to work out the details and make a final decision on the project in the second half of the year.
2005-04-21	Daimler Weighs Plant in China For Imports to U.S.	DaimlerChrysler AG is in talks with one of its Chinese partners to build a plant in China in order to export subcompact cars to the United States, a top company executive said Thursday at the Shanghai Auto Show. Dr. Ruediger Grube, the DaimlerChrysler executive president and management board member in charge of corporate development and China operations, said that while no final decision had been made, he hoped that the details could be worked out in the second half of this year. It would almost certainly be the first mass-produced Chinese car widely sold in America.
2005-04-08	Kerkorian Loses His Suit Against DaimlerChrysler	A federal judge in Delaware ruled against the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian in his lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler on Thursday, picking apart his fraud claims in a ruling that came more than a year after the trial. In the case, Mr. Kerkorian's investment company, the Tracinda Corporation, claimed that it had been deceived by executives of DaimlerBenz and Chrysler about the nature of the 1998 merger. Executives on both sides of the Atlantic had depicted the combination as a ''merger of equals'' but in the years since, the new company has become dominated by German executives and Chrysler is now run by a former Mercedes executive, Dieter Zetsche.
2005-04-02	DaimlerChrysler To Scale Back Mini-Car Unit	How did a pint-size car named Smart manage to make DaimlerChrysler look, well, dumb? On Friday, the company announced that it would drastically scale back its troubled Smart division, eliminating two models and cutting 700 employees, at a cost of up to 1.2 billion euros ($1.55 billion).
2005-03-27	The Nation; Detroit's New Crisis Could Be Its Worst	BIG SLICE has a prescription for the ills facing Detroit's automakers. ''They need to step their game up and put their ear to the streets,'' said the bear-sized 32-year-old who lives outside Los Angeles and customizes cars and buses for the rapper and trendsetter Snoop Dogg that include a purple and gold 1967 Pontiac Parisienne signed by several Los Angeles Lakers. ''Go put your ear to the street and ask people what they want instead of trying to force something on people,'' he said. ''They're making ugly cars.''
2005-03-22	Big Three Workers Give an Inch on Health Care	Like other Big Three auto workers, Deborah Stewart has medical coverage that is, if not a free lunch, then close to it. No deductibles. No monthly premiums. But Ms. Stewart, who works at a sprawling General Motors complex in the shadows of the Detroit skyline, says she believes it cannot last. ''They're losing money, saying they've got to make changes, and I think everybody expects that it's going to come,'' said Ms. Stewart, 55, referring to cuts in health care benefits. A 30-year G.M. veteran who oversees robots that attach fenders to cars, she was heading out after her shift Monday at the Detroit/Hamtramck assembly plant, which produces cars like the Buick LeSabre. ''I think it will come,'' she said, ''without a doubt.''
2005-03-14	For Many Signals, a Singular Solution	CAR radio is no longer just AM and FM, music and news; signals plucked from the atmosphere now include cellphone chatter, traffic data and global positioning data from satellites. Typically, each stream of radio waves is handed off to a separate receiver that is tuned to its own part of the frequency band. For carmakers, the use of such stand-alone receivers is a big expense, not just for the hardware but also for the wiring and installation. That is why the auto industry is moving toward a concept known as software-defined radio -- tuners that decode whatever signals its software instructs it to.
2005-03-03	Taking Down the 'No Foreign Cars' Signs in Michigan	At many union halls in Michigan, signs on parking lots still warn that foreign-made cars ''will be towed away at owner's expense.'' So why is Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, pushing so hard to close a sweetheart land deal with Toyota Motor?
2005-03-02	Europe, Meet Cadillac and Dodge	A week after President Bush toured Europe to try to patch up the tattered trans-Atlantic relationship, the American car industry is embarking on its own charm offensive. Whether Detroit will make more headway than Washington is anybody's guess. Cadillac, a unit of General Motors, and the Dodge unit of DaimlerChrysler unveiled new cars at the Geneva Motor Show on Tuesday that they hope will lead a fresh push into the European market.
2005-02-22	Building Autos With the Same DNA; Saab's New S.U.V. Has a Lot in Common With Buick, GMC and Isuzu	Is the 9-7X the first sport utility vehicle from Saab, or is it a Chevy TrailBlazer dressed up to look Swedish? The 9-7X, which is to come out this spring, will be roughly the same size and shape as a TrailBlazer, and for that matter, a GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier and Isuzu Ascender. It will roll off the same production line as the TrailBlazer, Envoy, Rainier and Ascender at a General Motors plant in Moraine, Ohio. All five S.U.V.'s share a pickup truck frame, the same engines, a similar sheet-metal design and many of the same parts, but the Saab has a base price of $38,270, about $11,000 higher than the TrailBlazer.
2005-02-11	DaimlerChrysler Profit Sinks on Mercedes Weakness	The severity of the problems facing Mercedes-Benz became clear Thursday, when its German-American parent, DaimlerChrysler, reported a 63 percent slide in earnings as profits collapsed at the flagship auto division. DaimlerChrysler's fourth-quarter net income declined to 526 million euros ($674 million), coming in below analysts' forecasts, and down from 1.4 billion euros in the year-ago period.
2005-02-09	Loss Doubles At Mitsubishi For 9 Months; Sales Off 12%	Net losses at Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled to 228.2 billion yen, or $2.16 billion, in the nine-month period ended on Dec. 31, the company said Tuesday, as a continuing tumble in sales derailed its turnaround effort. Sales in two crucial markets, the United States and Japan, have fallen sharply in the last year amid worries about the quality of Mitsubishi vehicles and as a result of a botched marketing strategy in the United States.
2005-02-02	In a Tough Month for Autos, Ford Takes the Biggest Fall	Month after month, Detroit continues to lose American customers to Asian competitors. Last month, it was the Ford Motor Company that lost the most, with sales falling 4.9 percent in January compared with the same month a year earlier, Ward's AutoInfoBank reported Tuesday. And financial analysts are beginning to worry about the sales pace of some of Ford's new products.
2005-01-31	Dubai Buys Large Stake in DaimlerChrysler	Dubai International Capital, an investment company owned by the government of the Persian Gulf emirate, said Sunday that it had purchased a $1 billion stake in DaimlerChrysler. The purchase makes Dubai International, a unit of the management group Dubai Holding, the third-largest owner of DaimlerChrysler stock, the group said in a statement. Daimler's two top shareholders are Deutsche Bank and Kuwait.
2005-01-10	On a Mission For Mercedes: Burnishing A Faded Star	When DaimlerChrysler asked Eckhard Cordes to take the helm of Mercedes-Benz last summer, he knew it was less a promotion than an anointment. Not only is Mercedes the flagship of this trans-Atlantic company, but it also has long been the crown jewel of German industry. Still, these days Mercedes stands for something else. Deteriorating profits and mounting quality problems have made Mercedes a metaphor for Germany's struggle to maintain its place in the global economy.
2005-01-10	Chrysler Reviving Dodge Charger, A Studied Attempt to Be Retro-Cool	The Dodge Charger is coming back, but the General Lee is not. Or at least not until the movie version of the 1980's TV show ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' is released this summer. Two decades after the original Charger was put out to pasture, Chrysler is reintroducing the car here on Sunday at a press preview at the North American International Auto Show. Bo and Luke Duke's Charger -- a Confederate flag adorned General Lee -- was hardly politically correct by current standards, but it is one of television's best known cars.
2005-01-09	In Detroit, the Dogs Have Their Day	CUE the orchestra to strike up ''Tomorrow.'' The 2005 Detroit auto show may resemble nothing so much as a production of ''Annie,'' as the industry's neglected offspring, ragtag orphans and homely stepchildren get their moments in the spotlight. The emphasis at this year's show, which begins press previews today and opens to the public Saturday at Cobo Center in downtown Detroit, will be on brands and divisions in need of at least a shampoo and a shower, and in some cases an extreme makeover.
2005-01-05	3 Japanese Carmakers Gain Against Big 3 in the U.S.	For Japanese automakers, last year brought feast or famine in the United States. Toyota, Honda and Nissan's American sales continued to surge in December, according to figures released Tuesday by the automakers, as the companies made further inroads against the Big Three domestic manufacturers, particularly General Motors and Ford Motor.
2004-12-27	Dodge Charger, a Name of Many Shapes	ANGRY letters have been deluging DaimlerChrysler headquarters in Michigan ever since the company announced in October that it would bring back the Charger nameplate for a 2006 Dodge. The reason for the outcry is that the revered model name will be affixed to four- door sedans, an affront to purists who say it should be reserved for two-door coupes, where it was first used four decades ago. The revived Charger will make its debut next month at the Detroit auto show.
2004-12-22	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Dec. 14 about plans by General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to collaborate on hybrid electric vehicles misspelled the surname of the executive vice president for product development at Chrysler, who commented on the development. He is Eric Ridenour, not Ridenhour.
2004-12-18	World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Fuel-Cell Investment	Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler will invest 55 million Canadian dollars ($44.6 million) in a fuel-cell maker, Ballard Power Systems, as the automakers rework their alliance to speed development of the alternative-energy devices. Ford will buy 2.03 million shares at 12.34 Canadian dollars a share, for a total of 25 million Canadian dollars, while DaimlerChrysler will buy 2.43 million shares at the same price, for 30 million Canadian dollars, Ballard said. Ford and Chrysler agreed to buy the shares last December, when Ballard's stock price was above $15 a share. Ballard, of Burnaby, British Columbia, reached an agreement with the automakers in July that if it did not exercise the investment by the end of the year, the price of the shares would be reset to the market price. Ballard's stock price rose 71 Canadian cents yesterday, closing at 8.35 Canadian dollars a share.
2004-12-14	G.M. and Daimler to Work Jointly on Hybrid Engine	The prospects for hybrid electric vehicles were bolstered Monday when General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, two automakers long skeptical about hybrids, said they would develop them by working together. The two companies have already been separately developing hybrids and said they had been in discussions since last year. They agreed to jointly develop a compact hybrid system that saves gas on both the highway and in the city, where today's hybrids are more efficient. It will also be designed for full-size trucks and for use with diesel and gasoline engines.
2004-12-13	Stephen A. Girard Jr., 91, Helped Introduce Jeep to Civilian Drivers	Stephen A. Girard Jr., an industrialist and automaker who helped introduce the Jeep, formerly a generic military transport, to civilians around the world, died on Nov. 27 in Napa, Calif. He was 91 and lived in Napa. His death was confirmed by his family.
2004-12-10	Regulators Ask Chrysler to Recall Pickups	Federal regulators have asked the Chrysler Group to voluntarily recall about 600,000 Dodge Durango and Dakota pickup trucks, the company said Thursday. At least 100 of the trucks from the model years 2000 to 2003 have had failures of an important suspension joint. In most cases, the failure causes the truck's frame to collapse. In a few cases it has led to a wheel coming off. There has been one report of an injury, which the company said was not life-threatening.
2004-12-08	Automakers Sue to Block Emissions Law In California	Toyota, General Motors and seven other automakers filed suit on Tuesday to block California's new greenhouse gas regulation, which was approved by the state in its final form in September. The suit sets up a battle between automakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Although Mr. Schwarzenegger is a fan of the Hummer, an S.U.V. with prodigious greenhouse gas emissions, he has promised nonetheless to defend the regulation, which was signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis.
2004-11-27	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Mercedes Earnings May Fall	DaimlerChrysler, the world's fifth-largest carmaker, said the dollar's decline against the euro would reduce the earnings of the Mercedes-Benz division, adding to the woes of the luxury-car unit. ''We weren't prepared for the dollar to be at this level,'' Thomas Weber, the management board member responsible for research, said in Frankfurt on Thursday. ''It will influence the results at Mercedes and 2005 won't be an easy year.'' Earnings at Mercedes Car Group plunged by half in the third quarter as American sales fell. The carmaker spent money to improve quality, which suffered with the debut of new electronics in cars, said J.D. Power and Associates. Mercedes's market share in the United States dropped to 1.2 percent in the first nine months from 1.3 percent amid competition from Bayerische Motoren Werke.
2004-11-27	This Year, Ontario May Pass Michigan In Making Vehicles	Michigan has been the heart of the auto industry since Henry Ford started mass-producing the Model T a century ago, but the Midwestern state is poised to be surpassed by Ontario. The Canadian province is on course to pass Michigan this year and become the biggest auto-producing state or province in North America, according to Ward's Automotive, which tracks auto production data.
2004-11-17	Jeep May Try to Revive Market for Smaller Trucks	The Chrysler Group said Tuesday that it was considering building its first new Jeep pickup truck in more than a decade as part of a broader effort by automakers to rekindle interest in small to midsize pickups. The company, a division of DaimlerChrysler, unveiled sketches of a prototype Jeep pickup, called the Gladiator, that is modeled after Jeep's signature sport utility vehicle, the Wrangler.
2004-11-09	A Diabetes Researcher Forges Her Own Path to a Cure	Dr. Denise Faustman thinks she has a shot at curing diabetes. She has published one significant scientific paper after another on the disease. She has succeeded in curing it in mice, something no one else has accomplished.
2004-11-07	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Chrysler and Dodge Minivans; The Case for Musical Chairs And Movies on Demand	IT has come to this: DaimlerChrysler is marketing its latest minivans not so much on ride, safety, styling, performance or quality, but mainly on how easily the furniture can be rearranged. The automaker spent $400 million on a crash program to bring out the 2005 versions of its Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan minivans in just 18 months. The vans, which went on sale last spring, are not easy to distinguish from the previous generation, with one marked exception: the so-called Stow 'n Go seating system that allows the chairs in the second and third rows to fold flat into bins in the floor in roughly 30 seconds.
2004-10-29	Two German Automakers Report Mixed Earnings	Germany, with its high costs, reluctant consumers and restive auto workers, has become a major drag on the country's two largest carmakers, DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen, which both reported mixed earnings on Thursday. DaimlerChrysler had an operating profit of 1.3 billion euros ($1.65 billion) in the third quarter because of the resurgence of its Chrysler division. That is about a 7 percent increase over the period a year ago.
2004-10-19	G.M. Workers in Germany Protest Job Cuts a 3rd Day	Just days after it announced deep job cuts in Europe, the General Motors Corporation is battling a wildcat strike at one of its biggest German auto plants, and a threat of wider disruptions. Workers at the Opel assembly plant in Bochum refused to work on Monday for the third day, blocking the entrance to the factory and brushing aside the pleas of German politicians to compromise.
2004-10-19	World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Chrysler Adds A Shift	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler reached an agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers to add a shift and 900 jobs at an Ontario plant to meet demand for the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Magnum cars, the union and company said. Chrysler plans to begin production on the new Dodge Charger at the factory, which is located in Brampton, Ontario, a company spokesman, Mike Aberlich, said. Chrysler sold 77,013 of the 300 model through September, more than triple the year-earlier sales of the 300M that it replaced. Sales of the 300 and Magnum have helped Chrysler increase its market share through nine months this year in the United States, to 13 percent from 12.8 percent a year earlier. Chrysler plans to build the Charger using the same design as the 300 and Magnum produced in Brampton.
2004-10-09	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: A Charge At Truckmaker	DaimlerChrysler said it would take a 400 million euro ($496 million) charge in the third quarter for recalls at its Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation division in Asia. DaimlerChrysler owns 65 percent of Fuso, which has announced a spate of recalls since March, affecting about 525,000 vehicles, to fix some defects like faulty wheel brakes. DaimlerChrysler is sharing the cost of the recall with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, which owns 35 percent of Fuso.
2004-10-07	Volkswagen Hires Ex-Chrysler Officer	Volkswagen, plucking a fallen star from a rival German carmaker, announced on Wednesday that Wolfgang Bernhard, a former DaimlerChrysler executive known for his cost-cutting skills and new-product flair, will take over its ailing flagship car brand. Mr. Bernhard, 44, had been abruptly sidelined by DaimlerChrysler's board last April, just as he was scheduled to move from the No. 2 position at Chrysler to the top job at the company's Mercedes-Benz division.
2004-10-03	Dodge Is Whistling Dixie Again	NO word yet on the trunk capacity of the 2006 Dodge Charger, but it had better be huge. The car will arrive with a lot of baggage. Few automobiles have achieved the pop-icon status attained by the fastback, Coke-bottle Charger of the late 1960's, and Americans' fuzzy memories are bound to create high expectations for the reincarnated nameplate.
2004-10-03	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Dodge Magnum; For Hauling Bodies, Warm or Otherwise	''IS that a hearse in your driveway?'' my neighbor asked in the matter-of-fact tone of someone who has seen almost every imaginable motor vehicle pull up next door, including the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile. The dark gray car in question was not, in fact, a conveyance for the dearly departed. Nor was it a sign that my household had gone Goth. Rather, it was a 2005 Magnum, the station wagon that is breathing life into Dodge and, along with its Chrysler 300 sibling, is resuscitating the Chrysler Group's car business.
2004-10-02	Car Sales Up 5.6% in Month, With G.M. and Toyota in Lead	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent in September from last year, with General Motors and Toyota posting double-digit gains, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The strong September, which came after a disappointing August, was indicative of the roller coaster trend the industry, in particular the domestic automakers, has encountered for several months. Often, a sluggish sales month has been followed by a big surge as automakers come back with higher cash and financing incentives and more inventive marketing programs.
2004-09-16	Anticipating intense competition, carmakers tune up their images.	HAVE you heard about the presentation that agencies are making to automotive clients, encouraging them to spend more? Its title: ''Advertise. Because Oprah Can't Give Cars to Everyone.'' Of course, Madison Avenue will not actually make any such presentation as the 2005 model year gets under way. But the 276 new Pontiac G6 sport sedans that Oprah Winfrey presented to delighted members of her studio audience on Monday -- a product placement that cost General Motors more than $7 million -- are indicative of new initiatives by agencies and automakers as competition intensifies.
2004-09-12	Making Money Fast On Very Slow Cars	AS hot new marketing concepts go, this one is a head-scratcher: seeking out people with suspended driver's licenses and renting cars to them at a discount. But that odd notion has become such a big hit for Enzo Stretti, 44, and his Enzo Location car rental agency in the Vaud canton of southwestern Switzerland that competitors are copying it. And he is preparing to expand to Zurich and elsewhere, possibly even to France and Italy.
2004-09-09	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Joint Auto-Making Venture	The South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, which broke off an Asian trucks venture with DaimlerChrysler in May, said it had found a new partner to make buses and trucks in China. Hyundai Motor said it would set up a $780 million assembly line in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui with the Jianghuai Automobile Company. The assembly line, which is scheduled to start in 2006, will be able to make 90,000 trucks, 10,000 buses and 50,000 van engines by 2010, Hyundai said.
2004-09-02	G.M. and Ford to Cut Production	General Motors and Ford Motor said today that they would cut car and truck production in the fourth quarter by as much as 7 percent because vehicles were piling up unsold in inventory. Each company experienced a sharp drop in sales last month, along with the auto industry as a whole, new figures released today show. According to Ward's AutoInfoBank, the average number of new cars and light-duty trucks sold daily last month fell by 5.6 percent from August 2003.
2004-08-27	Sure, It's Pragmatic. But Stylish? The Minivan Is Getting a Makeover	Julie Blewitt once vowed she would never own a minivan. ''I grew up humiliated being chauffeured about in a wood-paneled station wagon,'' said Ms. Blewitt, 34, of Loveland, Colo. ''I swore I would never drive the modern-day equivalent.'' But a couple of children can dent such resolve. Earlier this summer, she and her husband competed at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan in the Minivan Summer Games, part of a promotion by DaimlerChrysler, in the auto industry's latest attempt to cast off the minivan's dowdy image.
2004-08-15	Ideas & Trends: Slaves for Vacation; Europe Ponders the Meaning of Life	IT is August in Europe, which means if you're not a lifeguard, an Olympic athlete or a Florentine gelato vendor, you're probably on vacation. Paris, Berlin and other busy metropolises have emptied out, as the natives indulge in an annual European rite: the long summer siesta. This year, though, the Germans and French may not find much peace as they kick back in their Tuscan villas and Majorcan beach houses. Their beloved European lifestyle, with its 35-hour workweek, frequent holidays and six-week vacations, is under threat as never before.
2004-08-04	Bargains Help Auto Industry Recover in July	Auto sales rebounded in July after a disappointing June, driven by hot products like the Toyota Sienna minivan and the Chrysler 300C sedan and by big incentives on sport utility vehicles, figures released on Tuesday showed. Ward's AutoInfoBank estimated that July's seasonally adjusted selling rate was 17.24 million units, a sharp increase from the 15.4 million-unit rate in June, the lowest in six years.
2004-07-30	Chrysler, With a Profit, Lifts Quarter For Daimler	Earnings at DaimlerChrysler soared, rising more than fivefold in the second quarter, lifted by a continuing recovery at the company's Chrysler unit as well as strong performances in its financial services and commercial vehicle divisions. But Daimler's crown jewel, the Mercedes group, reported a decline in operating profits, and executives said they no longer expected the division to match its 2003 earnings.
2004-07-28	Study Says Blacks Paid More for Honda Loans	A new study has found that black customers are almost twice as likely as whites to be charged a marked-up rate when they finance a purchase through the loan subsidiary of Honda Motor, and that on average, blacks are charged higher markups than whites. The study, covering nearly 400,000 people who borrowed from the American Honda Finance Corporation from June 1999 to March 2003, was conducted by Mark Cohen, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits against several automakers. His research has been at the center of those cases.
2004-07-24	Concessions By Employees At Daimler	DaimlerChrysler employees at Mercedes factories in Germany have agreed to smaller raises and increased hours after the carmaker threatened to shed 6,000 jobs, adding to pressure for a longer workweek nationwide. Emboldened by the reduced power of labor unions amid rising unemployment, Germany's biggest companies are asking employees to work longer to save their jobs.
2004-07-16	Dispute Disrupts Daimler in Germany	Tens of thousands of autoworkers walked off the job Thursday at Mercedes-Benz plants across Germany, intensifying an already bitter dispute between DaimlerChrysler and its union. More than 20,000 workers left the assembly line at the flagship Mercedes plant in Sindelfingen, where the company has been trying to eliminate hourly breaks in an effort to cut labor costs. About 10,000 people walked out of a nearby plant that makes engines and other components.
2004-07-10	Chrysler Aloof, So Far, From Latest Incentive War	While General Motors and Ford are increasing incentives to combat slipping market share and rising inventories, Chrysler is holding back as it makes inroads on its two main rivals. G.M. announced this week that it was increasing its incentives on 2004 trucks and sport utility vehicles to $5,000, from $4,000, and is offering $4,000 cash back on most of its cars. It also expanded the rebates to include anyone who walks into the showroom. In June, the offer was only open to current owners of G.M. vehicles.
2004-07-09	DAIMLERCHRYSLER AND FORD AGREE TO INVEST IN BALLARD	DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor have agreed to invest $100 million in Ballard Power Systems, the biggest maker of fuel cells for automobiles, and to restructure their alliance with the company to speed development of alternative energy devices. DaimlerChrysler and Ford will give Ballard $58 million to develop a line of fuel cells and electronic drives, and gain control of Ballard, the chief executive of Ballard, Dennis Campbell, said yesterday. The United States is offering $1.2 billion in tax breaks and grants to spur creation of fuel cells, which are being developed to replace gasoline engines.
2004-07-06	Mercedes Promotion During Theater Festival	Mercedes-Benz USA in Montvale, N.J., part of DaimlerChrysler, has begun promoting its Smart line of compact, low-emission vehicles in the United States by sponsoring a theater festival in New York, two years ahead of the vehicles' scheduled introduction. Mercedes will promote the Summer Play Festival, which runs throughout July, by having three Smart Fortwo cars with the festival logo drive around the city and distribute information on the festival and Smart cars.
2004-07-04	A Union Label, Inside Out	FOR more than half a century, Bea LaSorda's family history has been entwined with cars and Chrysler. Her father, Harry Rooney, led the local union in this small Canadian city across a slim river from Detroit. When she was a girl, he charged her, only half-jokingly, with keeping a lookout for Chrysler's company men while factory workers signed union cards in the basement. As a teenager, she watched Chrysler -- then and now the city's biggest employer -- try to throw him in jail. Her husband, Frank, another union leader, helped lead Chrysler through what were arguably its most difficult years -- those leading up to its 1980 bailout by the United States government, when Lee A. Iacocca was Chrysler's chief executive.
2004-07-04	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Chrysler 300 and 300C; At the Junction of Main Street, Bling-Bling and Bada-Bing	THE Chrysler 300 would like your attention, please. And attention must be paid, because this car is significant for a variety of reasons. It is the sort of spacious family sedan that Americans used to love, but that has mostly faded from the streets. It represents a return to rear-wheel drive, a setup that Detroit, spurred by the Japanese, mostly abandoned for automobiles long ago.
2004-07-04	Armani, Gucci, Hemi: The Engine as a Status Symbol	THE crossword clue was ''Powerful car engine.'' The answer was ''Hemi.'' ''That was in The New York Times,'' Joe Eberhardt, Chrysler's executive vice president for global sales and marketing, said proudly. He cited another favorite mention of his favorite engine: ''It's a cartoon. In it, two sheiks are admiring an M-1 tank somewhere in the Middle East. One asks the driver, 'That thing got a Hemi in it?''' (For the record, the Chrysler-built M-1 does not.) It seems the first thing every parking valet, gasoline jockey and would-be street dragster wants to know, any time a new Dodge or Chrysler pulls up, is, ''That thing got a Hemi in it?'' Imagine the feelings of inadequacy of those who must say no.
2004-07-02	Ford and G.M. Sales Both Fell More Than 11% in June	General Motors and Ford Motor said Thursday that their United States sales for June had double-digit declines, as Detroit continued to lose ground to Japanese and Korean rivals. Over all, sales in the United States were weaker than expected, down 5.97 percent from a year ago, when adjusted for an extra sales day this year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The seasonally adjusted selling rate for cars and light trucks tumbled to 15.4 million in June from 17.8 million in May, Ward's said.
2004-06-30	BANK OF AMERICA BUYS CHRYSLER'S CREDIT-CARD ACCOUNTS	The Bank of America Corporation bought about 160,000 DaimlerChrysler credit-card accounts for an undisclosed price. The transaction makes Bank of America the issuer of Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Mercedes-Benz Visa credit-card portfolios in North America, the company said. DaimlerChrysler's North American financing unit, Chrysler Financial and Mercedes-Benz Credit, provides automobile financing for dealers and consumers, the company said in the statement. The unit is based in Farmington, Mich. A Chrysler Financial spokeswoman said Columbus Bank and Trust, a unit of the Synovus Financial Corporation of Columbus, Ga., was the previous card issuer. Bank of America is based in Charlotte, N.C.
2004-06-26	Fo Shizzle, That Big Bad Chrysler Really Does Sizzle	When a global tastemaker like Snoop Dogg calls, the Motor City listens. So it was last month, when the rapper, actor and linguistic innovator, who added the suffix ''izzle'' to the American lexicon, left the following message at Chrysler's West Coast business office about the company's new 300C sedan:
2004-06-16	World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: DaimlerChrysler Cuts Jobs	The DaimlerChrysler Corporation said it had cut 15 percent of its 400 management jobs in Brazil to streamline its system of command. Most of the layoffs occurred at the company's main plant in São Bernardo do Campo on the outskirts of São Paulo, where it makes buses and trucks. Todd Benson (NYT)
2004-06-11	CHRYSLER FACES AN EXTENDED INVESTIGATION INTO AIRBAGS	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler faces an expanded federal investigation of almost 1.3 million minivans because they may have an airbag defect similar to a problem that caused a 2002 recall. The inquiry covers 1998 to 2000 models of Caravan, Grand Caravan, Voyager, Grand Voyager and Town and Country, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said yesterday. A faulty clock spring may cause a circuit failure, with the driver's airbag, horn or cruise control not working, the agency said on its Web site. The agency and Chrysler have received 782 complaints about the possible defect, with reports of four crashes with injuries, a spokesman, Tim Hurd, said.
2004-06-04	Cute, Clean, Quiet and Pulling Into Traffic	ON most mornings when he thinks there might be a swell, Tim Brown, who lives in Laguna Beach, Calif., takes a cup of coffee and his labradoodle and heads out to check the waves. His three-finned surfboard is strapped down and ready, overhanging the tiny roof of a curious metallic-gray-and-white machine that looks one part Volkswagen Beetle, one part iMac and one part golf cart. He climbs in, settles the dog in the passenger seat, turns a key, hits the ''forward'' button and rolls away in near silence through tree-lined streets toward the beach, ready for neighbors' friendly waves and tourists' dumbfounded stares. It's another day in a GEM car.
2004-05-21	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Truck Recall	Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus, an affiliate of DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi Motors, said it would recall 180,000 trucks after determining that defective parts might have been a cause in a series of accidents, including a fatal one. The fatality, which occurred in 2002, is the second death linked to a defective Mitsubishi truck. Mitsubishi Fuso was a division of Mitsubishi Motors when the accidents occurred. Mitsubishi managers knew of the defects as long ago as 1996 and should have recalled vehicles then, said Mitsubishi Fuso's chief executive, Wilfried Porth, above, who blamed a culture of concealment among previous executives for the delay. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-05-20	The Big Three Fear That Toyota Is Becoming the Big One	Toyota may not quite be the world's largest automaker, based on vehicle sales, but it is firmly buckled in the industry's driver's seat. That reality was reinforced last week when Toyota reported $10.2 billion in earnings for its latest fiscal year, which ended in March, the most ever made in a single year by a Japanese company.
2004-05-18	MAGNA INTERNATIONAL BUYS DAIMLERCHRYSLER UNIT	Magna International, a Canadian auto-parts maker, has agreed to buy the operations of DaimlerChrysler's New Venture Gear unit for about $435 million to expand sales of drivetrain components. Magna said New Venture, which had $1.5 billion in sales last year, has factories in Syracuse, N.Y., and Roitzsch, Germany. The agreement calls for Magna to initially buy an 80 percent stake in New Venture's operations in the United States, which includes a sales office and research center in Troy, Mich., and acquire the rest in 2007. Magna says it would buy the German plant directly. The total purchase will be in cash and notes.
2004-05-13	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Auto Stake Sale	DaimlerChrysler confirmed that it had agreed to sell its 10.5 percent stake in the Hyundai Motor Company, ending a four-year alliance. The move is another pullback by DaimlerChrysler from its Asia strategy. In mid-April, the company said that it would stop injecting funds into its ailing Japanese partner, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Kim Dong Jin, vice chairman of Hyundai Motor, said Daimler would sell the stake, valued at $860 million, to several unidentified investors.
2004-05-12	Daimler Is Said to Reach Deal To Sell Its Stake in Hyundai	DaimlerChrysler has reached an agreement to sell its 10.5 percent stake in Hyundai Motor and will announce the deal today, a person close to the situation said yesterday. The move comes after an announcement last month by Hyundai, the Korean automaker whose brands include Kia, that it wanted to review its relationship with Daimler.
2004-05-07	G.M. JOINS RIVALS IN INCREASING REBATES ON SPORT UTILITIES	General Motors added $1,000 to rebates on midsize sport utility vehicles like the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, a day after Ford and DaimlerChrysler raised their incentives for sport utilities. The increase doubles, to $2,000, the rebates consumers can use with existing no-interest loan offers of up to five years, a G.M. spokeswoman said. The offers end June 1. Ford and Chrysler increased rebates after Toyota and Nissan won market share in April.
2004-05-06	FORD AND CHRYSLER RAISE LIGHT TRUCK INCENTIVES	Ford and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have increased incentives on light trucks after Toyota and Nissan gained market share last month. Ford is offering $1,000 and no-interest 60-month loans on Explorer sport utility vehicles, Excursion and Expedition S.U.V.'s and Freestar minivans, a spokesman, Jim Cain, said. Chrysler added $2,000 to incentives on the Durango sport utility, to a total $3,500, a spokesman, Kevin McCormick, said. General Motors has offered similar incentives since April 1. The American automakers' share of the light truck market in the first four months of this year slid to 71.9 percent from 73.8 percent a year earlier.
2004-05-05	Auto Sales Lower Than Expected in April	Sales of several popular large sport utility vehicles, including the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition and Cadillac Escalade, tailed off in April, but automakers generally insist that high gas prices are not changing the purchase decisions of customers. Sales of sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks continue to dominate the market, but there were signs of a shift from the largest S.U.V.'s to smaller ones in the auto industry's April sales reports, which were released on Monday and Tuesday.
2004-05-04	A top creative executive at an agency in Detroit is moving on, and changing car brands.	ONE of the most peripatetic creative executives in automotive advertising, Gary Topolewski, is on the move again, poached unexpectedly by the agency that produces campaigns for the Chrysler Group from an agency that works for General Motors. Mr. Topolewski is leaving Chemistri in Troy, Mich., where he had been chairman and chief creative officer, working on G.M. brands like Cadillac and Pontiac, for the Troy office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Mr. Topolewski, 47, will join the Troy office, known as BBDO Detroit, as one of two chief creative officers, working with Bill Morden, who had been the sole chief creative officer since 2001.
2004-05-01	The Training Is on the Job At Mitsubishi	Yoichiro Okazaki, the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries executive appointed to be the new chief executive of the ailing Mitsubishi Motors, said Friday that he would be leading the company at the most difficult time in its history. Mr. Okazaki, 61, who has no previous experience in the auto business, succeeds Rolf Eckrodt, the DaimlerChrysler-appointed executive who resigned Monday after the unexpected decision by DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi's biggest shareholder, to stop supporting its Japanese partner.
2004-04-30	Daimler Board Blocks Protégé Of Troubled Chief	DaimlerChrysler's chief executive, Jürgen E. Schrempp, survived a critical board meeting yesterday, a week after the board rejected his proposal that the company bail out its struggling Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors. But a top protégé of Mr. Schrempp did not survive. The board decided that Wolfgang Bernhard, the chief operating officer of the Chrysler division, would not take control of the company's crown jewel, Mercedes, as he had been scheduled to do tomorrow.
2004-04-29	A Hobbled Daimler Chief May Shift Focus to China	When Jürgen E. Schrempp faces the 20 members of DaimlerChrysler's board in New York on Thursday, he will bring at least one piece of good news: Beijing officials are expected to sign off on a joint venture to assemble Mercedes-Benz cars in China. The agreement may be delivered by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China when he visits Berlin next week, people at the company said.
2004-04-27	Daimler's Money Withheld, Mitsubishi Chief Resigns	The president and chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors, Rolf Eckrodt, resigned Monday, a few days after a decision by DaimlerChrysler to stop supporting its Japanese partner sent the company into a frantic search for new cash. Mr. Eckrodt, 61, a former Daimler executive, decided to quit ''to make way for a new team,'' he said in a statement. Mitsubishi named its chief financial officer, Keiichiro Hashimoto, as interim president while a permanent successor is sought.
2004-04-25	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Chrysler Crossfire roadster and PT Cruiser convertible; Chrysler Adds Some Sizzle to Its Summer Entrées	TO survive in today's hypercompetitive market, automakers have to create maximum sizzle at minimum cost. Chrysler certainly gets the point, unveiling not one, but two, convertible variations of existing models in time for summer. Both will turn heads from South Beach to the Santa Monica pier. The 2005 PT Cruiser convertible is a jazzy but surprisingly practical ragtop, offering the virtues of open-air driving with few of the usual drawbacks.
2004-04-24	DaimlerChrysler Faces Big Setback Over Mitsubishi	For Jürgen E. Schrempp, Mitsubishi Motors was the last brick in a grand building project that created the first truly global car company -- uniting Germany's aristocratic Mercedes-Benz with the mass-market Chrysler and Japan's scrappy Mitsubishi. Now, Mitsubishi has become the first brick to tumble out of DaimlerChrysler's facade, and analysts, investors and competitors are asking whether its collapse will pull down the whole edifice.
2004-04-24	CARMAKERS LIMIT NEW YORK LEASES	Two years ago, shopping for a sporty Chevrolet Cavalier, Jessica Coutsonikas took the route of many a first-time car-buyer short on cash but long on desire: she decided to lease. But when she went to DePaula Chevrolet here on Thursday to lease a new car, she discovered that in New York, leasing the Cavalier was no longer an option.
2004-04-23	Daimler Says It Won't Bail Out a Partner, Mitsubishi Motors	DaimlerChrysler will not bail out its struggling partner, Mitsubishi Motors, putting a cloud over the Japanese automaker's future. DaimlerChrysler, the largest shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, with a 37 percent stake, said in a brief statement released in Germany late Thursday that it had decided not to pump cash into the company to keep it solvent.
2004-04-19	Struck in Side, Many Cars Fare Poorly In Safety Test	The results are in from the first consumer test of how passenger cars fare when struck in the side by sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. And they are not good. Ten of 13 midsize car models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group financed by car insurers, received the lowest of four possible ratings, indicating a likelihood of serious or fatal injury. The tests also showed that women were at disproportionate risk in truck-car side-impact collisions.
2004-04-08	DAIMLERCHRYSLER SAYS '04 PROFIT WILL RISE SLIGHTLY	DaimlerChrysler said yesterday that it still expected 2004 profit to rise slightly, held back by losses at its Mitsubishi Motors affiliate and the cost of introducing new models. Net income will grow from last year's 448 million euros ($541 million) as the Chrysler unit returns to profitability, the carmaker said at the annual shareholders' meeting in Berlin, reiterating a forecast from February. DaimlerChrysler is helping put together a reorganization of Mitsubishi Motors, in which it has a 37 percent stake. Chrysler is expected to become profitable on the strength of new models.
2004-04-07	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: DaimlerChrysler To Install Sirius Radios	Sirius Satellite Radio said yesterday that its radio would be installed in 11 DaimlerChrysler vehicle lines for the 2005 model year. The company expects about 550,000 new subscribers by 2006 from the agreement. Chrysler factories will install the satellite radios on Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge vehicles, including the Chrysler 300 Series, Dodge Ram pickup trucks and the Jeep Liberty, Sirius said. Sirius is issuing warrants to DaimlerChrysler to buy up to 21.5 million shares of Sirius at $1.04 each. That is a 65 percent discount to warrants issued in an earlier agreement. Sirius has exclusive partnerships with DaimlerChrysler, BMW and Ford Motor. The Ford agreement has not produced any radio installations. In January 2003 DaimlerChrysler began offering Sirius's subscription-radio service as a dealer-installed option on 16 of its cars and trucks. Shares of Sirius rose 14 cents to $3.89.

2004-04-02	For Americans, Gas Guzzlers Are Again Kings Of the Road	Gasoline prices may be at an all-time high, but that is not deterring Americans from buying gas guzzlers. Maintaining a trend that dates back more than a decade, American buyers continued to shift from passenger cars to the largest and least fuel-efficient new vehicles that auto manufacturers offer, even as gasoline prices soar, according to the industry's March sales reports.
2004-03-26	CHRYSLER TO STOP OFFERING LEASES IN NEW YORK STATE	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler will stop offering vehicle leases in New York State May 1 because of a law that holds leasing companies liable in accidents. The action by Chrysler comes a day after the Honda Motor Company said it resumed leasing in New York and raised prices to compensate for the state law. General Motors and Ford halted leasing in New York last year.
2004-03-19	Get Smart: Buyers Try to Jump the Queue	MOST automotive fantasies involve a lot of horsepower, preferably wrapped in sheet metal hammered to shape in a small town in Italy. But the car that Joan Hurley of Baltimore daydreams of owning one day is a diminutive two-seater with a three-cylinder engine and just 61 horsepower. It also gets 60 miles a gallon. ''It's sort of a romantic notion,'' she acknowledged of her infatuation with the Smart City-Coupe, which she first saw while on vacation in Spain.
2004-03-15	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; The Original Chrysler 300: Hemi Hot Rod for Bankers	THOROUGHLY practical reasons, not a collector's passion, brought George W. Riehl his first Chrysler 300, a 1957 model. Very simply, his mother was wearing out the car's rear tires too quickly. Purchased new by his father, the copper brown coupe's 375 horsepower made it too easy for a woman with ''a heavy foot'' -- in the words of Mr. Riehl's wife, Eleanor -- to burn rubber.
2004-03-14	Business People; Auto Bosses Are Spotted In a Bread Line	The executive dining room at Chrysler headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., has become the executive chow line.

2004-03-12	G.M. Says Costs For Retiree Care Top $60 Billion	General Motors said on Thursday that its future health care obligation for retirees rose last year to $63.4 billion, from $57 billion in 2002. If not for the effects of the new Medicare legislation signed in December by President Bush, the obligation would have been $67.5 billion. The figures were disclosed in the company's annual report, which was released on Thursday. Many domestic manufacturers say that soaring health care costs have become their chief competitive burden.
2004-03-12	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Truck Recall	Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus, an affiliate of DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi Motors, said faulty design might have been a cause in several accidents, including a fatal one, involving wheels falling off moving trucks. Mitsubishi Fuso, which was spun off from Mitsubishi Motors last year, said it would recall 45,000 trucks to repair defective wheels. More than 50 accidents involving Mitsubishi trucks losing wheels have been reported since 1992. Mitsubishi Motors has suffered a sharp decline in sales since a series of recalls beginning in 2000.

2004-03-08	Chrysler waves a cease-and-desist letter and Ford's commercial for a foldaway seat vanishes.	THE Ford Motor Company's latest advertisement for its Freestar minivan has disappeared faster than the foldaway seat feature it was promoting. Ford said last week that it had stopped running a commercial for its the minivan after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from its crosstown rival, Chrysler.
2004-02-20	Daimler Accepts Some Blame for Toll Venture	A day after the board of DaimlerChrysler announced that it would extend Jürgen E. Schrempp's contract as chief executive, Mr. Schrempp ran into a storm of questions on Thursday over the company's role in a botched highway toll collection system in Germany. Mr. Schrempp, who appeared at DaimlerChrysler's financial news conference in this suburb of Stuttgart, admitted that the company had stumbled on the project, which the German government angrily canceled this week, after technical flaws repeatedly delayed its operation.
2004-02-17	Board Is Said To Pick Chief For Mercedes	The No.2 executive at the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler has been tapped to take over its Mercedes division, people close to the company said yesterday. The executive, Wolfgang Bernhard, who is the chief operating officer of Chrysler, has been proposed for the position by DaimlerChrysler's management board, which also proposed elevating Thomas W. LaSorda, Chrysler's executive vice president for manufacturing, to succeed Mr. Bernhard, these people said. Mr. LaSorda, a Canadian, would be the highest ranking non-German executive at Chrysler.
2004-02-12	Chrysler Deal Called a 'Godsend'	On the last day of testimony in Kirk Kerkorian's fraud lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler, the company's expert witness described the $36 billion combination that created the company as a ''godsend'' for Chrysler shareholders, including Mr. Kerkorian. ''This merger was a godsend for Chrysler, and this was the best thing that happened to Chrysler,'' said Daniel Fischel, a business and law professor at the University of Chicago. Professor Fischel rejected opposing testimony from experts like William Silber, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, who said the failure of Chrysler's directors to negotiate a higher premium for shareholders amounted to a ''present'' for Daimler.
2004-02-11	Ex-Executive For Chrysler Defends Merger	A former Chrysler chief financial officer, Gary Valade, testified Tuesday that he had not been ''snookered'' by the 1998 merger of Chrysler with Daimler-Benz. ''From the shareholders' standpoint, I think we negotiated the highest premium that was possible to negotiate,'' Mr. Valade said of the 28 percent adjustment that gave Chrysler shareholders a $57.50 share value used for the stock exchange ratio in the deal.
2004-02-10	Miscellany	AT&T, DaimlerChrysler and Samsung Electronics have been signed by CNN as sponsors of its yearlong election coverage under the ''America Votes 2004'' banner. The sponsorships, for undisclosed terms, also include properties like the CNN Web site and Headline News network in addition to the flagship CNN network. CNN is a division of Turner Broadcasting System, owned by Time Warner. Media Analysis Plus, Denver, acquired for undisclosed terms the media auditing division of Hawk Media, San Francisco. The division will be merged into Media Analysis Plus and will operate under the Hawk name. Media Analysis Plus is owned by Cable Audit Associates.
2004-02-10	Trial of Suit Against Daimler Resumes	Jürgen Schrempp, the chairman of DaimlerChrysler, testified on Monday that he explored incorporating a combination of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz in the United States but that doing so would have caused political problems with German unions without providing any tax advantage for shareholders. Mr. Schrempp's testimony came during the resumption of the trial of a fraud lawsuit brought by the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who contends that the $36 billion transaction that created the company was deceptively described as a merger of equals instead of an acquisition of Chrysler and deprived him of the premium he would have demanded under an outright takeover.
2004-02-07	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Carmaker Strikes Continue	DaimlerChrysler and the Adam Opel unit of General Motors were among companies hit by a seventh day of labor stoppages aimed at pressing demands for more pay, the IG Metall union said. About 50,000 workers at 156 production sites walked off their shifts temporarily or left work early to support union demands for 4 percent more pay, IG Metall said. The union said it planned more walkouts next week at companies including the Audi unit of Volkswagen on Monday and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, the world's largest maker of printing equipment, on Tuesday.
2004-02-04	Incentives and New S.U.V. Help Chrysler Bolster Sales	By offering incentives worth more than $1,000 and a range of new sport utility models, the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler and several Japanese automakers racked up sales gains in January even as General Motors and the Ford Motor Company posted declines. Chrysler said its sales increased 9 percent last month compared with the corresponding month in 2003 after adjusting for one extra selling day this January. Including Mercedes, sales for DaimlerChrysler over all rose 7.7 percent, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich.
2004-02-03	DaimlerChrysler Trial Set to Resume Next Week	The trial of Kirk Kerkorian's fraud lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler will resume next Monday for two days of testimony, with the company's chairman, Jürgen E. Schrempp, scheduled to return to the stand, a court spokeswoman said on Monday. Mr. Kerkorian's investment company, the Tracinda Corporation, sued DaimlerChrysler in 2000, contending the transaction that created the company was deceptively described as a merger of equals instead of an acquisition of Chrysler.
2004-01-31	Judge Says DaimlerChrysler Trial Will Resume	The judge overseeing the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's fraud lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler told lawyers in a conference call on Friday that the trial he suspended last month would resume either Feb. 9 or March 11. He gave the two sides until Monday to agree on the date. On Dec. 16, Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. of Federal District Court here abruptly halted the trial the day before it was to end when DaimlerChrysler disclosed that it had failed to provide documents sought before the trial by Mr. Kerkorian's investment company, the Tracinda Corporation. The documents in question are more than 61 pages of handwritten notes made by a former Chrysler executive, Gary Valade, during negotiations on the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz of Germany. Judge Farnan described them as ''very substantial testimony.''
2004-01-28	A new Jeep commercial hits back at Hummer as the two military offshoots continue their struggle.	THE big boys in Motor City's sandbox, Hummer and Jeep, are rumbling again. Jeep, a division of DaimlerChrysler, is running a commercial that shows a group of children tooting around in toy Jeeps while an overweight boy struggles to get his go-cart Hummer out of the mud.
2004-01-16	Daimler Will Add to Stake in Mitsubishi Truck Unit	DaimlerChrysler will buy an additional 22 percent of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus from Mitsubishi Motors, Daimler's struggling Japanese affiliate. DaimlerChrysler will spend about 52 billion yen ($489 mil by issuing new bonds. The additional cash from DaimlerChrysler will help Mitsubishi develop new models.
2004-01-10	Big Three Hope Rising Economy Will Lift All Vehicles	The Big Three are putting a bullish face on 2004, predicting that a wave of new products, aided by an improving economy, will increase earnings and might even cool off their price war. The first week of the year is always a big one in Detroit, opening with the press preview of the North American International Auto Show, where the industry shows off its new cars and trucks with plenty of pomp, rock and smoke machines.
2004-01-07	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about 2003 auto sales misstated DaimlerChrysler's share of the United States market. It was 14.1 percent; the 12.8 percent figure was for the Chrysler Group only.
2004-01-06	Detroit to Focus on Tastes as Its Market Share Decreases	The strengthening economy and generous sales incentives led to robust car sales last year, automakers said Monday, but the American companies' share of the market continued to shrink as import brands like Toyota, Honda and BMW posted the biggest gains. Despite those declines, the American companies did not pledge to increase market share in 2004, as they have often done. Instead, they said they would look for ways to make the cars and trucks that they do sell more profitable, largely by making them more appealing to consumers.
2004-01-04	In Detroit, Home Teams Swing for the Fences	THE Detroit Tigers ended their season a game shy of the modern record for most losses by a major league baseball team. The Lions, with just 5 wins and 11 losses, are sitting out the N.F.L. playoffs. There is hope, at least, for the Red Wings in hockey and the Pistons of the N.B.A. Hopeful, too, are the roughed-up home teams of the auto industry as they kick off 2004 on their home turf in the rollicking, bruising, cheerleading spectacle known as the North American International Auto Show.
2004-01-01	FreeMarkets Agrees to Buy Auction Unit of Covisint	FreeMarkets, which makes Internet-auction software, is buying the auto parts auction business of Covisint, a venture of General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler. FreeMarkets, which is based in Pittsburgh and expects to conclude the purchase in January, will fulfill parts contracts with the three automakers using its software for three years, the companies said in a statement yesterday. Terms were not disclosed.
2003-12-26	Cars That Nudge You to Drive More Safely	SITTING in the front seat of a rolling auto-safety lab called the Chrysler 300M IT (for ''information technology''), Ted Selker is one part mad scientist, one part absent-minded professor. Wearing a small red button (a copy of I.B.M.'s TrackPoint ''pencil eraser'' computer control, which he invented) clipped to his collarless shirt, he points out the car's capabilities -- it can tell if the driver is gripping the wheel loosely or tightly, where his eyes are focused and even whether he has taken his cup out of the cup holder. Then, Dr. Selker jumps out of the car and pops open the trunk to reboot a computer. As part of a collaborative project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, the carmaker DaimlerChrysler and the electronics company Motorola, Dr. Selker has wired the car with a network of cameras and sensors, all held together with black electric tape and Velcro. The aim is to turn the car, which Chrysler has been showing to journalists for the past few months, into a virtual driving coach -- an electronic back-seat driver turned front-seat friend -- to help reduce driver distraction.
2003-12-23	Lawyers Spar Over Notes in Chrysler Case	Lawyers for DaimlerChrysler and the billionaire investor and casino mogul, Kirk Kerkorian, engaged in a skirmish in federal district court on Monday over the tardy release of documents by the auto company that could be significant in their trial. The underlying dispute concerns the characterization of the combination of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler in 1998. Lawyers representing Mr. Kerkorian's company, the Tracinda Corporation, contend that the transaction was a stealth acquisition deceptively described as a merger of equals; DaimlerChrysler defends it was in fact a merger of equals. The trial was halted last week to allow for Monday's hearing.
2003-12-21	You Say 'Takeover.' I Say 'Merger of Equals.'	GUNNING BEDFORD JR., was known for bluster and brinkmanship. As one of Delaware's delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he threatened to seek ''some foreign ally of more honor and good faith'' unless small states received Congressional representation that reflected more than their population. He concluded his speech by thundering to his fellow delegates, ''I do not, gentlemen, trust you!'' Perhaps it is fitting that a portrait of the white-wigged Mr. Bedford, who went on to become a federal judge here, is one of two old oil paintings that dominate the courtroom where two legendary deal makers, Jürgen E. Schrempp and Kirk Kerkorian, appeared this month to dissect one of the largest global industrial mergers in history, the 1998 combination of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler.
2003-12-17	MITSUBISHI AND CHRYSLER TO JOIN FORCES ON TRUCKS	Mitsubishi Motors and DaimlerChrysler will build two sets of midsize pickup trucks at Chrysler's factory in Warren, Mich., starting next year. The companies will pool their technology but design different trucks. Mitsubishi is the latest Japanese company to invest more in America's lucrative truck market. Eric R. Ridenour, executive vice president for product development at Chrysler, said the alliance would allow the companies to reduce the time and cost of developing and producing the new lines.

But Christmas remained elusive once again. No matter where we looked, we could not find that one symbol or song to nudge us into embracing this special season, when many of us honor the birth of Jesus by shopping.
2003-12-17	Notes Prompt Judge to Halt Chrysler Trial	A judge abruptly suspended the trial of Kirk Kerkorian's lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler on Tuesday after lawyers for the automaker turned over notes from a former Chrysler executive that could bolster Mr. Kerkorian's case. The notes, which were produced at midnight Monday, throw into question the course of the trial, which was scheduled to end on Wednesday. The presiding judge, Joseph J. Farnan Jr. of Federal District Court here, ordered a separate hearing on Monday to determine why the lawyers did not turn over the 61 pages of notes earlier.
2003-12-14	Business; When a One-of-a-Kind Car Looks So Last Year	CHRYSLER had no idea that the PT Cruiser would be such a hit when it went on sale in the spring of 2000. Or that its buzz would evaporate three years later.
2003-12-12	Eugene A. Cafiero, 77, President of Chrysler in Time of Crisis	Eugene A. Cafiero, who was president of the Chrysler Corporation in the late 1970's, a period of roller coaster profits and losses for the company, died on Monday in Naples, Fla. He was 77. The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said his son-in-law, Stephan Hedbabny.
2003-12-11	Daimler Leader Explains Why He Called Deal Merger of Equals	The chairman of DaimlerChrysler, Jürgen E. Schrempp, resumed testifying in federal court here on Wednesday and gave his first in-depth explanation of a 2000 interview that demoralized Chrysler workers and enraged its former top shareholder. The interview, in The Financial Times of London, was the basis for the lawsuit brought against DaimlerChrysler by the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who was the largest shareholder of Chrysler before its 1998 merger with Daimler-Benz.
2003-12-10	Chrysler Deal Was a Merger, Executive Tells Court	The chairman of DaimlerChrysler, Jürgen E. Schrempp, testified in federal court here on Tuesday that Daimler-Benz executives deceived no one about the terms of the company's 1998 merger with Chrysler. ''The description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct,'' Mr. Schrempp said, referring to the widely debated term that was applied to the deal. ''And by telling the truth, I don't think I can defraud anyone.''
2003-12-09	Chrysler Investors Deserved More Money, Experts Testify	Witnesses for the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian testified on Monday that Chrysler shareholders should have been financially compensated for having two members on the DaimlerChrysler board while Daimler-Benz had nine. Mr. Kerkorian, who was the biggest shareholder in Chrysler, is suing DaimlerChrysler over the 1998 merger. The chairman of DaimlerChrysler, Jürgen E. Schrempp, will appear in federal court on Tuesday, a lawyer for Mr. Kerkorian's company, the Tracinda Corporation, was heard telling a colleague on Monday.
2003-12-05	Ex-Chairman Of Chrysler Testifies in Suit	The former chairman of Chrysler, Robert J. Eaton, testified yesterday that Chrysler was never taken over in its 1998 transaction with Daimler-Benz, disputing a principal contention of the plaintiff in the suit, the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian. Mr. Eaton told Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. that there were an equal number of Americans and Germans on the company's supervisory board, countering Mr. Kerkorian's assertions that Chrysler was taken over by Daimler and its chairman, Jürgen Schrempp.
2003-12-04	Ex-Chrysler President Testifies in Kerkorian Suit	A former president of Chrysler told a judge Wednesday that even if he had known Chrysler would become a division of DaimlerChrysler rather than an equal partner in a merger with Daimler-Benz, he would still have favored the deal. ''I would still say Chrysler needs a bigger partner going forward and Chrysler needs an identity within that organization,'' James P. Holden, the former president, said in response to a question by Federal District Court Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. here after more than three hours of testimony in the fraud trial of DaimlerChrysler.
2003-12-03	Revived Economy Helped Lift Automakers' November Sales	Sales at General Motors, BMW and Honda's luxury division, Acura, all surged last month, largely because of the rebounding economy, automakers said Tuesday. DaimlerChrysler said its sales rose slightly in November from the month a year ago, while the Ford Motor Company's sales showed a decline. G.M. said its sales grew 22 percent in November, with truck sales up 30 percent and the Cadillac division up 43 percent. Honda reported record sales for Acura, a gain of 24.7 percent over last year. BMW said it had its best November sales ever; sales increased 6.4 percent over all, led by an 18 percent increase for the Mini.
2003-12-01	Economy & Business; From Detroit, Big, Gutsy Cars and Wagons	WAIT long enough and everything comes back into fashion. For 2004, that means big rear-wheel-drive iron from the Detroit automakers. Over the next year, consumers will get a look at the biggest, gutsiest cars and wagons in a generation. While these automobiles might not be as long as the ocean liners that last plied the nation's highways in the 1970's, this new generation of rear-wheel-drive vehicles is bound to attract attention from drivers who have grown accustomed to sedate, almost generic, cars.
2003-11-29	Corrections	A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about a lawsuit brought by Kirk Kerkorian in connection with Daimler-Benz's acquisition of Chrysler reversed the identities of two executives. Robert J. Eaton, chief executive of Chrysler at the time of the merger in 1998, was at the left and Jürgen E. Schrempp, chairman of Daimler-Benz, at the right.
2003-11-28	DaimlerChrysler Heads to Court Over '98 Merger	Five years after Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler to create DaimlerChrysler AG, the deal will go on trial, beginning Monday, in a Wilmington, Del., federal courtroom. Not since John and Horace Dodge sued Henry Ford in 1916 have such prominent shareholders confronted a captain of the auto industry in court.
2003-11-22	DaimlerChrysler Loses Bid to End Suit	DaimlerChrysler has lost a final bid to win dismissal of the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian's fraud lawsuit, which asserts he was deceived about the terms of the 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corpopration. Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. of United States District Court in Delaware found yesterday that DaimlerChrysler executives could not show Mr. Kerkorian unreasonably relied on their statements that the combination would be a merger of equals rather than a takeover in deciding whether he would back the deal. He is seeking $3 billion in damages.

2003-11-14	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about a downgrade in the debt rating of the Ford Motor Company by Standard & Poor's referred incorrectly to the ratings of General Motors and DaimlerChrysler. While S.& P. has a negative outlook on the companies, it does not have them on a more serious credit watch. The article also referred incorrectly to the profit margins achieved by the top Japanese automakers. The 8 percent figure was for operating margins, not net ones. Because of an editing error, the article referred imprecisely to the rally in Ford's stock. Investors were relieved that the downgrade was not accompanied by a negative outlook, not that the rating stayed above junk status.
2003-11-13	China Lowers the Wall for U.S. Cars and Parts	In a move to quell criticism of its huge trade surplus with the United States, China agreed to let the Big Three automakers send it about 15,000 cars and trucks over the next couple of years as well as more than $1 billion in parts from General Motors, the companies said Wednesday. China also said that it would allow G.M. to import cars directly, without using a local partner, and G.M. said it was moving into the auto lending business in China.

G.M. said its sales dropped 7 percent in October, while Ford said sales fell 2 percent. Among the Big Three, only the Chrysler Corporation, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, reported a gain over last year, rising 11 percent to let it remain in third place ahead of the Toyota Motor Company of Japan, which said sales rose 11.7 percent in October.
2003-10-30	Metalworkers Stage Strike At Carmakers In Brazil	Although their industry is facing its worst crisis in years, thousands of metalworkers in Brazil's industrial heartland downed tools on Wednesday, halting about one-third of the country's auto and truck production at plants belonging to Ford Motor, Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Scania. According to the ABC Metalworkers Union, once led by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, about 24,000 workers -- three-quarters of the auto production work force in factories in São Paulo's industrial belt -- were on strike after rejecting a raise of nearly 16 percent, four percentage points less than what the unions had asked for.
2003-10-25	Germany's Toll-Collection Plan Stalls	Few countries take more pride in their highways than does Germany. And few countries get more credit for their engineering talent, especially when it comes to automotive matters. So Germany's long-delayed, problem-ridden effort to design a toll-collection system for trucks on the autobahn has been a double blow to the national pride. Adding to the sense of chagrin, the project is backed by two of Germany's corporate icons: Deutsche Telekom and DaimlerChrysler.
2003-10-22	Mitsubishi Falters as Other Makers Thrive	While Toyota, Honda and Nissan prosper, Mitsubishi continues to stumble. Mitsubishi's credit rating was cut two notches on Tuesday, to further below investment grade by Standard & Poor's, which cited the company's weak sales in the United States and losses on its consumer loans.
2003-10-22	The Motor City And California: Is It Splitsville?	CALIFORNIA and the Motor City used to be the perfect couple. With its freeways and easygoing, put-the-top-down mentality, the Golden State was the car state of the nation -- and the car was most definitely made in America. Can you imagine the Beach Boys singing about imports? (''And she'll have fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the Honda Civic away.'') Or try to envision Hollywood icons of days gone by -- McQueen and the Rat Pack -- in anything but the likes of Fords, Lincolns or Chevys? Of course not. But the freeways got clogged, American cars lost their ring-a-ding-ding and the romance soured. California remains the car state, but about the only new domestic sedans you see on the roads now are from the rental car lots of Avis, Hertz and Budget.
2003-10-22	Daimler Has Slim Profit At Chrysler In Quarter	DaimlerChrysler eked out a thin profit in the third quarter at its troubled Chrysler division, citing stringent cost-cutting and a calmer-than-expected market for costly sales incentives. But that bit of good news Tuesday was spoiled by the rating agency Standard & Poor's, which cut DaimlerChrysler's credit rating, saying that Chrysler still posed a threat to the company's overall financial stability.
2003-10-12	Private Sector; Trucks Give a Daimler Star a Lift	TO visit the imposing headquarters of DaimlerChrysler here, with its rows of Mercedes-Benzes parked out front like a Praetorian Guard, is to understand where the heart of this vast automotive empire lies. There isn't a Chrysler in sight -- to say nothing of the trucks, buses and vans that generate nearly a fifth of its $156 billion in sales. Yet these country cousins, not the polished Mercedes-Benzes, are the key to whether DaimlerChrysler can rebound from its current misery or will become a case study of an ambitious merger gone awry.
2003-10-07	Union Organizing Remains Muddled In Chrysler Pact	The Chrysler Group's new contract with the United Automobile Workers union, ratified by workers last month, fell short of one of the union's top goals: persuading DaimlerChrysler to recognize what are known as card checks to unionize American plants owned by the Mercedes division. The union has never successfully organized a plant owned solely by a foreign automaker, but it had hoped it might have an opportunity at Mercedes because the 1998 acquisition of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz put Mercedes and Chrysler under the same corporate umbrella.
2003-10-07	Justices Let Stand Ruling That Allows Forcibly Drugging an Inmate Before Execution	The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court allowing Arkansas officials to force a convicted murderer to take drugs that would make him sane enough to be executed. The justices opened their fall term by listing dozens of cases decided by lower courts that they reviewed during the summer recess and chose not to reconsider. In addition to the Arkansas case, they let stand a ruling by the South Carolina Supreme Court upholding a murder conviction for a woman who used crack cocaine and then delivered a stillborn baby.
2003-10-04	Shares of Parts Supplier Tumble on Chrysler Report	Shares of Collins & Aikman, the auto parts supplier run by David Stockman, the former Reagan administration official, plummeted on Friday on a report that its contracts with Chrysler were in jeopardy. The stock fell more than 30 percent after an article in The Detroit Free Press said that Chrysler had decided to put most of its business with Collins & Aikman, which amounts to $850 million a year, up for bidding by other suppliers. Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, is Collins & Aikman's biggest customer, while Collins & Aikman is among Chrysler's 10 biggest suppliers.
2003-10-02	Buyers Cash In on Offers to Keep Car Sales Strong	September auto sales slowed from August but continued to show strength, surprising analysts. Customers took advantage of the latest price war. Last month, General Motors was giving away Dell computers to Saturn buyers, in addition to the usual offer of zero-percent financing and big rebates that were heaviest on remaining 2003 models.
2003-09-26	Automakers Sue Over Asbestos Maneuver	The three largest United States automakers have sued to block Honeywell International Inc. from transferring its Bendix brake unit to the bankrupt Federal-Mogul Corporation, contending the transaction would unfairly saddle the car companies with increased asbestos liabilities. Honeywell seeks to use the transaction to extricate itself from more than 50,000 asbestos lawsuits against Bendix. Federal-Mogul filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2001 to resolve about 360,000 asbestos suits and future claims by establishing a trust to pay victims. Claims against Bendix would be channeled into the trust, possibly freeing Honeywell from liability.
2003-09-23	Auto Deal or Bust	Last week, the United Automobile Workers offered more concessions to the Big Three than it has in the last two decades of contract talks. Then again, concessions have not really been a feature of the last two decades of contract talks in the American auto industry. While auto workers see a contract that extends a lifeline to the struggling Big Three, Wall Street sees baby steps that amount to a glass half-full in some minds and fully empty in others.
2003-09-21	Business People; Couture Update: 3 Deals, 3 Looks For U.A.W.'s Chief	Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers, made an industrial fashion statement last week: he donned buttoned-down shirts with the union's logo to announce deals with Detroit's Big Three. At Chrysler, Mr. Gettelfinger wore blue, collar and all. At Ford, however, he showed up in a flattering camel-colored shirt that complemented the brown double-breasted suit coat and tie worn by the company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr. To reach a deal with General Motors, Mr. Gettelfinger chose blue-and-white stripes, which nicely set off his bright white mustache.
2003-09-19	G.M. Accord Finishes Talks For U.A.W.	The United Automobile Workers union concluded its contract negotiations with the Big Three and two major suppliers today after granting its most significant concessions in two decades. The deals, which will result in thousands of job cuts as roughly a dozen plants are closed or sold, reflect the broad competitive struggles of domestic manufacturers, and the union's effort to balance the desires of its members with the shrinking market share and profits of the automakers.
2003-09-17	Tough Times Force U.A.W. To Employ New Strategy	The nearly simultaneous deals the United Automobile Workers union announced Monday with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group represent a sharp break with tradition and underscore how tough times are for the Big Three and their suppliers. Terms of the four-year labor contracts keep the union workers' generous health care benefits largely intact, but the union gave ground on other important issues, including scaling back wage increases and selectively lifting a ban on plant closings, according to people with knowledge of the deals.
2003-09-16	Labor Pacts Reached at Ford and Chrysler	The Ford Motor Company and the auto parts giant Visteon said late this evening that they had reached tentative agreement on four-year labor contracts with the United Automobile Workers union. The Ford deal was the second announced today between the union and a Big Three automaker, an unusually swift resolution to the talks that reflects union leaders' realization of the competitive difficulties faced by the Big Three, whose domestic market share fell to a record monthly low in August.
2003-09-15	Union in Deal With Chrysler; Talks With 2 Makers Continue	The United Auto Workers union said early this morning that a tentative agreement had been reached with the Chrysler Group on a new four-year contract. The union apparently fell short in its attempt to reach an unusual three-way, simultaneous deal with all of the Big Three automakers. People familiar with the negotiations said that the union had sought such a deal with General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler.
2003-09-12	Big 3 and Union Said to Be Near One Deal for All	The Big Three and the United Automobile Workers are on the brink of an unprecedented early and simultaneous resolution to their contract talks, people close to the negotiations said. The parties are looking to wrap up negotiations before midnight Sunday, when the four-year labor contracts expire. Reaching an accord at all three companies would be a historic sign of unity between the union and management, but time is running short and hiccups have a way of derailing negotiations.
2003-09-12	Big Hopes for Filling China's Garages	Canvas the top automotive executives at the Frankfurt International Motor Show about what gives them hope for their industry's future, and the answer is the same: China. With their home countries in the doldrums, and the outlook for 2004 scarcely better, the eyes of the world's automakers are fixed firmly on the market in China, where sales of cars and trucks are rocketing.
2003-09-10	DaimlerChrysler Struggles To Turn the Corner; Troubling Economic Signs for Giant Automaker	It is hard to shake the feeling that DaimlerChrysler owns the Frankfurt International Motor Show: the company showcases its cars in imperial style over three exhibition halls. But at this year's show, which opened to the media today, it is also hard to shake the feeling that DaimlerChrysler, Germany's largest and the world's fifth-largest carmaker, is out of step with both the industry and consumers.
2003-09-09	DaimlerChrysler Is Planning Mercedes Production in China	Struggling to catch up in the world's fastest-growing major market for vehicles, DaimlerChrysler agreed today to expand its operations in China to include the production of Mercedes C-Class and E-Class cars and large trucks. Volkswagen, the German archrival of DaimlerChrysler, controls nearly half the Chinese market, and its Audis are staples of the luxury market, especially in northern China. General Motors has had considerable success with its Buick division in China. The BMW brand has also gained cachet, and BMW is in the final stages of preparing for large-scale production in China.
2003-09-08	Chrysler and G.M. Resume Union Talks	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, which has told its union that it may need additional job cuts to stem losses, and General Motors resumed labor negotiations yesterday on a new contract. Ford Motor took the day off. Negotiations between the companies and the United Auto Workers recessed Saturday night after around-the-clock talks since Sept. 3.
2003-09-07	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chrysler Crossfire; Find the Mercedes in This Picture	DAIMLER-BENZ'S surprise takeover of Chrysler in 1998 was accompanied by a corporate song and dance about the synergies of combining Daimler's engineering prowess with Chrysler's marketing flair. The S-Class marries the Viper, etc. In truth, the whole proved less than the sum of the parts. But five years later, those who found much to like in each company can at last point to a new vehicle that is obviously a child of the marriage: the 2004 Chrysler Crossfire coupe.
2003-09-04	With a Torrid Month, Toyota Moves Ahead of Chrysler in Sales	The day that the American automobile industry has been dreading for years arrived today. Toyota outsold Chrysler in August, the first time one of Detroit's Big Three has fallen to fourth place. Toyota's accomplishment capped the hottest month of the year thus far for the industry, though overall sales dropped about 1 percent from August 2002, the best month last year, according to figures from Ward's Automotive Reports. Foreign car makers smashed sales records last month, but General Motors' sales were virtually unchanged from August 2002; Chrysler fell 6 percent and sales at Ford Motor plunged 13 percent from last year.
2003-09-03	CHRYSLER RAISES REBATES TO COMBAT SALES DECLINE	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. is adding incentives to most 2004 models to increase sales and reverse a 4.7 percent sales decline so far this year. ''Instead of following, we're trying to aggressively set the pattern for incentives,'' a spokesman, James Kenyon, said. The rebates will be from $500 to $3,000 on almost all 2004 models. They replace incentives as high as $2,000 offered on nine models in August, Mr. Kenyon said. Incentives on 2003 models are mostly the same except for an increase in the rebates for PT Cruisers, from $1,500 to $2,500, he said. The rebates expire Oct. 31.
2003-08-27	Car Sales Slow Despite Spending on Incentives	In another sign of how competitive the car market has become, auto companies spent a record amount on incentives in July, yet their vehicles sat unsold on dealers' lots for a record length of time. Moreover, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Corporation lost market share in July, though the average incentives for Detroit's auto companies grew to the highest level ever, according to Edmunds.com, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that offers consumers buying advice and tracks industry trends.
2003-08-24	On the Way: A Bumper Crop	AMERICANS bought 38,000 gas-electric hybrid vehicles last year, and sales are likely to reach 54,000 in 2003, according to a recent study by J.D. Power & Associates, the big market-research firm. That is only the beginning, if J.D. Power's predictions pan out: the firm expects 500,000 annual hybrid sales by 2008 and 872,000 by 2013. Since only three hybrid cars are currently available, reaching those lofty figures will require new varieties of hybrids -- and they are certainly on the way.
2003-08-23	Competition Is Generating Deals on Luxury Vehicles	No matter how tough the times in the car business, the luxury market has always been a haven for profits and prestige. But this summer, incentives are soaring on luxury vehicles, just as they are on volume brands. Discounts are widely available on almost every manner of luxury vehicle from Europe, Japan and Detroit. Buyers of the $70,000 BMW 7-series sedan are getting average incentives above $5,600 from the sticker prices, according to Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers buying advice and tracks industry trends.
2003-08-14	Cleaner Air, Courtesy of California	At a time when neither Congress nor the administration seems interested in significantly improving automobile efficiency, California has kept up the good fight and has now won an important victory. The Times's Danny Hakim reported this week that General Motors and DaimlerChrysler had agreed to drop their lawsuits against a California rule requiring automakers to produce millions of cleaner, more efficient ''hybrid'' vehicles -- cars powered by a combination of gasoline and electricity -- over the next 15 years. Since other states, like New York, often follow California's lead in these matters, such vehicles may in time be available everywhere. This, in turn, could lead to progress not only on cleaner air but also on global warming and the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil. At issue was California's 1990 zero-emission rule, which decreed that 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state from 2003 to 2008 be pollution-free. That essentially meant electric cars, but since these have turned out to be a commercial dead end, California wisely extended the deadline and invited the industry to meet part of its quota with hybrids. The industry, which hates quotas, went to court, arguing that the rule was merely a backdoor way of setting new fuel economy standards, a federal prerogative. California retorted that it was interested only in reducing air pollution and that improved mileage would be a serendipitous byproduct.
2003-08-12	AUTOMAKERS DROP SUITS ON AIR RULES	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are dropping lawsuits against California over a landmark clean-air regulation that requires the production of millions of low-emission cars and trucks over the next decade and a half. The move creates a temporary but momentous environmental truce between the auto industry, which has blocked the zero-emission vehicle mandate that was set in motion in 1990, and California, which wields enormous influence over the global industry.
2003-08-02	Vehicle Sales Dipped in July For Big Three	American consumers gave the auto industry its best month of the year in July. Unfortunately for Detroit, they did so by buying vehicles with foreign nameplates. General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler all said today that their sales of cars and trucks fell last month, even though the companies are collectively offering the biggest incentives ever.
2003-07-25	In Europe, Profits Are Painfully Low For Auto Industry	A wintry chill has settled over Europe's automobile industry this summer, as DaimlerChrysler of Germany and Peugeot of France reported sharply lower profits today, while investors prepared for a bleak earnings report expected from Volkswagen on Friday. Renault managed to post an increase in profits, thanks to buoyant results at Nissan Motor, in which it has a 44 percent stake. But the fact that France's second-largest carmaker depended on its Japanese partner to salvage its numbers underscores the ills afflicting Europe's industry.
2003-07-20	Finding the Right Balance for Celine	Joe Eberhardt, the new executive vice president of marketing at Chrysler, is looking for just the right way to deploy Celine Dion, the Canadian singer. Earlier this year, Ms. Dion signed a three-year contract, worth a reported $14 million, with Mr. Eberhardt's predecessor, James Schroer, to be the company's pitchwoman. In true diva fashion, she hit the airwaves in lavish commercials for Chrysler vehicles and relentlessly plugged Chrysler on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' But the approach appeared to generate more publicity for Ms. Dion than for Chrysler. In particular, it overshadowed the new Pacifica, a plump $32,000 station wagon that Chrysler had hoped would be an instant success but that had disappointing initial sales.
2003-07-15	Their Health Costs Soaring, Automakers Are to Begin Labor Talks	The Big Three automakers, which open contract talks with the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday, are making a bigger issue out of reducing medical costs than they have in years. But the union has staked out health insurance as untouchable. ''We're not going to share costs,'' said Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W. president, at a recent news briefing.
2003-07-10	Law Firm Is Sued Over Conduct in Liability Case	A Texas law firm faked evidence and tried to bribe witnesses in a products liability case, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday in San Antonio by the DaimlerChrysler Corporation. The lawsuit follows an appeals court decision last year that dismissed the products liability case and imposed sanctions of $865,000 against three of the firm's lawyers. The appeals court called the firm's conduct ''an egregious example of the worst kind of abuse of the judicial system.''
2003-07-04	Day Camp for Drivers: Canapés, Perrier and S.U.V.'s	TWO neat envelopes arrived in the mail one day in May, both a tasteful beige and looking elegant. I opened the one from Lexus first. ''What if you had the opportunity to drive and evaluate a dozen of the world's finest luxury sport utility vehicles in one setting, and all the salespeople had the day off?'' it asked. ''Lexus invites you to an exclusive event'' -- the Luxury Refined Tour.
2003-07-02	4% Rise in Auto Sales in June Fuels Optimism at the Big Three	Nationwide auto sales rose in June, but the domestic industry continued to lose ground to foreign competitors like Toyota despite spending heavily on consumer purchase incentives. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company were upbeat in conference calls today, though, saying that they saw positive signs for industry sales in the second half of the year.
2003-06-19	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Truckmaker Forecasts Gain	A leading Japanese truckmaker, the Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, said it expected profit to more than triple in the year that began in April, helped by demand for new, cleaner diesel trucks. Mitsubishi Fuso said it would earn 5 billion yen ($42 million) this year with truck sales expected to grow 3 percent over all. DaimlerChrysler owns 43 percent of the company. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-06-19	U.S. Automakers Improve Efficiency, But Some Troubling Figures Remain	With every piece of good news about the Big Three comes another reminder of how wide the competitive gap with Japan remains. Today, a report on manufacturing efficiency in North American auto plants last year showed encouraging results for American automakers. General Motors continued to make impressive strides toward closing the productivity gap with Japanese automakers. And the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler, the least productive of the six largest automakers in North America, had the industry's best year-over-year improvement in 2002.
2003-06-15	More Makers Giving Power to All Four Corners	PUSH or pull, that is the question. The polls are closed, the votes have been counted and the contest over which is better, front-wheel drive or rear, has been decided. The market's decision: both of the above.
2003-06-13	CHRYSLER PLANS LOWER-PRICE VERSION OF ITS PACIFICA	Chrysler said yesterday that it would offer a lower-price version of its Pacifica, a new station wagon, as it tries to more than triple monthly sales of the car. The new version, to begin production in July, will cost less than $30,000, down from about $38,000 for models that started selling in April, the company said. Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, expects Pacifica sales in the United States to rise to about 8,000 to 9,000 a month by the end of the year. Sales through May totaled 4,828. It has said it wants to sell about 100,000 Pacificas a year.
2003-06-10	People	Cameron Day was named Chrysler brand creative director at the Troy, Mich., office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, assuming duties that had been handled by Bill Morden, vice chairman and chief creative officer. Mr. Day had been creative director on the Land Rover account at GSD&M, Austin, Tex., also part of Omnicom. Evelyn Neill was named to the new post of president for creative at Doremus, New York, as part of a reorganization. She had been senior vice president and group creative director at Deutsch, New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Doremus is part of the Omnicom Group.
2003-06-08	A Cry in the Wilderness, or Just a Good Cry?	Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, famously admonished the auto industry in January to ''stop whining'' about the interest-free loans and other incentives that automakers were offering to spur sales. The remark wasn't directed specifically at Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive at Chrysler, but Mr. Zetsche wants Mr. Wagoner to know he got the message.
2003-06-06	Doubts Crop Up Over Chrysler Turnaround Plan	Little more than two years ago, DaimlerChrysler dispatched a talented Mercedes-Benz executive, Dieter Zetsche, to turn around its ailing Chrysler unit. Mr. Zetsche pledged to cut costs, and started by eliminating 26,000 jobs. He also promised to give Chrysler a dose of European class on the cheap -- he called it ''disciplined pizazz.''
2003-06-05	DaimlerChrysler Stock Declines After Company Forecasts a Loss	Shares of DaimlerChrysler declined yesterday after the company said that its Chrysler unit would lose about $1.17 billion this quarter because discounts reduced revenue. The shares fell as much as 1.65 euros, to 25.10 euros, and closed down nearly 2 percent at 26.25 euros in Frankfurt. The stock is down 11 percent so far this year compared with a 6.5 percent increase in Germany's benchmark DAX index.
2003-06-05	Chrysler Design Awards Dropped After 10 Years	THE Chrysler Group, which spent the last decade promoting design innovation as central to its car-selling strategy, quietly but abruptly ended its Chrysler Design Awards program on Monday, two days after announcing staff changes at the top of its marketing department. On Tuesday the company said it would post a second-quarter operating loss of $1.2 billion. Chrysler's awards, given each fall, started in 1993 to recognize six designers based in the United States with a trophy and $10,000. (Last year, the award also recognized advocates of good design.) In a relatively short time, some began to think of the award as a mini-MacArthur Foundation grant in the design field, with awards going to the architect Frank O. Gehry (1995); the graphic designer Bruce Mau (1998); the team that designed the landing apparatus for the Mars Pathfinder probe (1998); and even the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was recognized last year for his labors on behalf of Grand Central Terminal and the planned conversion of the Farley Post Office to a new Penn Station.
2003-06-04	Chrysler Sees Sizable Loss For Quarter	Vividly illustrating the toll that incentives are taking on the American automobile industry, the Chrysler Corporation said today that it would post a $1.2 billion operating loss for the second quarter and would be only marginally profitable this year. The announcement that Chrysler and its parent, DaimlerChrysler, expected to miss their earnings goals came as automakers announced sales data showing that May was a tepid month over all, despite incentive programs that include big rebates and interest-free loans.
2003-06-01	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a brief report in the Private Sector column last Sunday about Stars and Cars, a charity event in Detroit, misstated the career path of Robert A. Lutz, the co-chairman. He left Chrysler in 1998, then joined Exide Technologies; he was hired by General Motors in 2001 as a vice chairman. He did not join G.M. directly from Chrysler.
2003-05-31	Top Marketer Quits Chrysler As Car Sales Remain Weak	The Chrysler Group said today that its marketing chief, James C. Schroer, was resigning, effective immediately. The move comes amid slumping sales for the company, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, and an increasingly pessimistic climate that is taking its toll on the once-chugging turnaround plan of Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche.
2003-05-23	Chrysler Ends Plan to Build Canada Plant	DaimlerChrysler has canceled plans to build a $1.5 billion assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, that would have produced a new line of small pickups under an innovative manufacturing arrangement with suppliers. The decision is a blow for Canada, which has been trying to attract new automotive investment but has lost out on several recent plant projects, which went to sites in Mexico and the southern United States. The last new assembly line built in Canada, at a plant for the Honda Motor Company in Alliston, Ontario, opened in 1996, and Canadian plants' share of new vehicles sold in North America has fallen to about 12 percent from 15.9 percent in 1999.
2003-05-02	Auto Sales Dropped 6.1% During April	Auto sales for April improved on a sluggish first quarter, receiving a modest bump from a renewed incentive push by the Big Three, but were still below the strong levels of a year ago. ''When one considers the heavy incentives for the month, the sales levels are quite disappointing,'' said Domenic D. Martilotti, an analyst for Bear, Stearns. ''Each iteration of this zero-percent-for-60-months push, there are clearly diminishing returns. So the question is, where do we go from here?''
2003-04-25	California Regulators Modify Auto Emissions Mandate	California regulators, responding to legal pressure from automakers and the Bush administration, amended a plan today to force the industry to produce clean cars but kept it ambitious enough to please environmental groups. By an 8-to-3 vote, the California Air Resources Board altered the influential Zero Emission Vehicle mandate so it will require fewer vehicles to be sold in California with no tailpipe emissions and more with modest emissions, like hybrids that supplement gasoline with electric power.
2003-04-25	Amid Expected Auto Slump, Daimler Warns on Chrysler	Amid new signs of a deterioration in the United States auto market, DaimlerChrysler said today that it would probably not achieve its earnings target for the Chrysler division this year. The warning, which came as the company reported better-than-expected overall earnings in the first quarter, was a significant disappointment because Chrysler had been shaping up as a respectable turnaround situation.
2003-04-20	As Comforting as a Casserole	''THIS car is like sushi,'' a Ford designer, Laurens van den Acker, said of the Model U, a futuristic design study he worked on. With brightly colored parts that can be recycled, the hip Model U was billed as ''the 21st-century successor of the Model T.'' By contrast, ''this is a hamburger,'' he said of the Ford 427, a big, square evocation of a 1960's family sedan.
2003-04-20	APPEAL TO AUTOMAKER	The state Department of Commerce is encouraging Daimler-Chrysler to build a parts distribution center and a truck factory in the state. Daimler-Chrysler officials have seen several sites in North and South Jersey; the prime competition is Windsor, Ontario, just east of Detroit. A spokeswoman for the department would not say what incentives the state was offering. Robert Strauss
2003-04-10	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Tough Target For Carmaker	Citing the slack global economy and the climbing cost of sales incentives in the United States, DaimlerChrysler said it would be difficult to meet its profit targets for 2003, though it has not given up hope. The company aims to exceed last year's operating profit of $6.2 billion, driven in part by a projected $2 billion profit at Chrysler. But with Chrysler's sales in the United States down 6.2 percent so far this year, the chairman, Jürgen E. Schrempp, above, said, ''it has become much more difficult to reach the targets we have set ourselves.'' Mark Landler (NYT)
2003-04-02	Detroit on a Mission: No Slip in Auto Sales	Auto sales continued their sluggish pace last month, according to figures released today, prompting the Big Three automakers to broaden their no-interest loan offers. Sales actually fell less than many analysts had expected in March, just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and cars were still selling at a fairly healthy rate. But automakers are clearly worried enough to offer a new round of deals that General Motors called unprecedented, setting up a test for the industry in April.
2003-03-30	Shelter I. Could Take Its Foot Off the Gas	DAIMLERCHRYSLER is looking at Shelter Island as a great place to test its little cars known as NEV's (neighborhood electric vehicles). They don't go faster than 25 miles per hour, produce no exhaust emissions, can carry two or four passengers, can cover 35 miles on one charge, and can be recharged overnight, connected to a 110-volt household outlet. Barry Carr, whose job is to market the electric cars on the East Coast for DaimlerChrysler's Global Electric Motorcars subsidiary, based in Fargo, N.D., visited the Shelter Island Town Board two weeks ago, suggesting that the town use some of the cars, known as GEM's, for parking patrols and to rent to summer visitors. They could leave their gas-powered cars behind at the Greenport ferry, he said, ride over as foot passengers and rent the electrics on the Island, puttering around from home to shop and beach without speeding, clogging up parking places or polluting the air.
2003-03-23	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chrysler Pacifica; A Wagon-Van-Sport Tourer Is Born	LONG road trips tend to generate inane conversations. One such discussion, which took place on my family's recent spring break trip to the Florida Keys, reminded me of the scene in ''Stand by Me'' in which the film's coming-of-age characters pondered what sort of animal Goofy, the Disney character, was supposed to be. As we drove south in a 2004 Chrysler Pacifica, I started the debate by asking, ''What kind of vehicle is this?''
2003-03-19	DAIMLER SAYS CRUCIAL PAPERS WERE DESTROYED	DaimlerChrysler said yesterday that an assistant to the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian had destroyed documents the company needs to defend itself against accusations that it deceived investors about the 1998 merger of Daimler Benz and Chrysler. According to a court filing, notes about premerger meetings between Mr. Kerkorian and Robert J. Eaton, the chief executive of Chrysler, were destroyed in 2000, five days before the lawsuit was filed. The suit accuses Daimler Benz of lying to investors to gain support for its $35 billion acquisition of Chrysler. The talks were the basis of some fraud accusations. The Tracinda Corporation, controlled by Mr. Kerkorian, and other shareholders sued DaimlerChrysler in November 2000, after the chief executive, Jürgen E. Schrempp, was quoted as saying that he had always intended to control Chrysler and operate it as a unit. The lawsuit says that the automaker had previously characterized the agreement as a ''merger of equals.''
2003-03-09	Chrysler Lights a Fire Under the Once-Poky PT	TESTED: 2003 Chrysler PT Turbo WHAT IS IT? -- Good question. Chrysler says it is a four-door multipurpose hatchback, but you could call it a retro hot-rod van. It resembles a small S.U.V., though it does not offer all-wheel drive. (Safety regulators classify it as a truck, though the government holds it to the fuel economy standards for cars.)
2003-03-06	California Offers Change In Car Rules	California is seeking to compromise with automakers by dropping a requirement that they sell electric cars, the state's latest attempt to persuade carmakers to end their opposition to the program. The California Air Resources Board outlined proposed changes to the zero-emission vehicle program today that would let companies sell more gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell autos instead of battery-powered cars starting with 2005 models, a spokesman, Dimitri Stanich, said.
2003-03-02	Leaving Tracks All Over The Dockets	WHEN is a Hummer not like a Jeep? When it is like a Studebaker, of course. All three have one thing in common: they've all been in litigation over their appearance. The first suit was a trademark infringement case brought by DaimlerChrysler against General Motors, which sells Hummers. A judge in Chicago ruled in January that the seven-bar grille of the Hummer H2 did not infringe on the design of Jeep's seven-bar grille.
2003-02-20	DaimlerChrysler Says Kerkorian Favored Merger	In its first detailed response to a long-simmering problem, DaimlerChrysler made public yesterday a lengthy legal rebuttal to a suit filed on behalf of Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire Las Vegas casino operator who was the biggest shareholder of Chrysler before it was acquired by Daimler-Benz in 1998. The Kerkorian suit, seeking an unspecified amount of damages, was filed more than two years ago. It contends that Jürgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chief executive, and other top executives of the former Daimler-Benz lied about the terms of the acquisition of Chrysler because they represented it as a ''merger of equals.''
2003-02-14	Advertisers decide it's time for 'reality' -- at least on television.	BLUE-CHIP advertisers are beginning to shed their disdain for the reality television genre, as the soaring popularity of these shows -- particularly among young consumers -- has persuaded many to embrace Robin Williams's motto: ''reality . . . what a concept.'' Mainstream marketers like DaimlerChrysler, General Motors, Mars, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Pfizer and Visa have started buying significant commercial time on reality TV shows. Their largess will in turn only keep encouraging the networks to inundate viewers with yet more bachelors and bachelorettes, survivors, would-be American idols, B-list celebrities and ersatz millionaires.
2003-02-13	THREE AUTOMAKERS IN JOINT VENTURE TO BUILD ENGINES	Hyundai Motor has joined with DaimlerChysler, which owns 10 percent of Hyundai's equity, and Mitsubishi Motors, which also has a small stake in Hyundai Motor, to build an engine plant in Dundee, Mich. The plant, to employ 400 workers, would develop four-cylinder gasoline-driven engines. Don Kirk (NYT)
2003-02-05	Cost-Cutting Lets Daimler Post Profit	Reaping the benefits of a stringent cost-cutting at its troubled Chrysler division, DaimlerChrysler of Germany said today that it had swung from a net loss to a profit in the fourth quarter and for all of 2002. While Daimler's results provided fresh evidence of stabilization at its Chrysler division in the United States, they still fell somewhat short of the expectations of industry analysts. The company also deflated shareholders by announcing a 50 percent increase in its dividend, rather than the doubling that many investors had expected.
2003-02-05	National Briefing | Midwest: Illinois: Racial Bias Case	A federal lawsuit has accused DaimlerChrysler of routinely denying African-American car buyers low-interest loans based on their race. The lawsuit on behalf of six black car owners accuses the company of unfairly rerouting credit applications from black consumers to its regional headquarters rather than processing them in an automated, colorblind computer program. Those customers were denied loans, the suit said. It also said that black customers who were in good standing had their vehicles repossessed without warning. A company spokesman denied the accusations, calling them outrageous. Jo Napolitano (NYT)
2003-02-04	January Auto Sales Fall 2% As Analysts See Tough Year	Auto sales dropped 2 percent in January from a year earlier, carmakers reported today, signaling what many analysts say will be a tough year for the industry. Consumers are expected to benefit, though, from a wave of new products, particularly from foreign automakers like Nissan Motor, and cheaper prices because of the competition. Ford sales were up 4 percent, while G.M. sales fell 2 percent and Chrysler sales fell 12 percent. Sales were also down sharply from December as Detroit and particularly General Motors stepped back from lavish end-of-the-year incentives.
2003-01-19	Private Sector; A Dodge Ram in the Tip Jar	Remember DaimlerChrysler's party at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit? It is always among the most lavish, in part because of its setting -- a 1929 firehouse near the Cobo convention center, where the show is held. This year, the extravagance extended to tips slipped across the bar set up inside the station. Not tips to the bartenders, but tips from them.
2003-01-07	At Auto Show, All-Frills Cars Are Out in Force	Times are lean and the economy shaky, but the auto industry is growing increasingly intent on coming up with offerings for the ultrarich. The latest among a bumper crop of new models aimed at the chauffeured class is a 1,000-horsepower prototype from the Cadillac division of General Motors, the Sixteen. It was shown Sunday night at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. As presented, the car looks like a cross between the Batmobile and a Rolls-Royce, and G.M. said it would be the first 16-cylinder engine produced since the 1940's.
2003-01-07	Chrysler Is Canceling Stewart Ads	Chrysler, which has advertised on Martha Stewart's television show and Web site and in her flagship magazine under a special contract that began last year, will end the arrangement when the contract expires in March, a spokesman for Chrysler said yesterday. Under the contract, Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, sponsors a feature called Road Trips on the television show and is the sole advertiser for a magazine section with the same name. The section features articles on such subjects as tracing family genealogies and holding family reunions, accompanied by full-page ads for cars like the Chrysler Town and Country minivan.
2003-01-04	G.M. Lifts Market Share On Sales Burst In December	General Motors, intent on increasing its market share for the second consecutive year, turned to a fire sale last month that lifted sales 36 percent and helped it accomplish its goal, according to figures released today. The back-to-back annual gain in market share was the first since 1976, but it was made possible by zero percent financing deals and reliance on less profitable sales to corporate and rental fleets. Now Wall Street and Detroit are wondering whether several years of outsize vehicle sales, propped up by increasingly large incentives from the Big Three, will make a feast or famine of 2003. Added to that is the uncertain economy and the potential for war in Iraq.
2002-12-24	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Toll Venture Investigation	The European Union has opened a four-month investigation into plans by DaimlerChrysler and Deutsche Telekom to form a joint venture to develop Germany's first truck-toll system. The German Transport Ministry awarded the contract to the joint venture in June. The toll system, which is two years behind schedule, might generate as much as 3.5 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in revenue a year for the government. The European Commission, the union's executive arm, said it was concerned the venture might hurt competition in Germany's telematics-services market because Daimler was already active in the industry.
2002-12-22	Private Sector; When There's Smoke at the Firehouse	Anyone trying to find Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, at the Detroit auto show next month need only look behind the bar. For the second year, Chrysler has rented the historic firehouse across the street from Detroit's Cobo convention center to use as a hospitality suite for industry executives and the automotive media. Mr. Zetsche has signed up as bartender, along with other Chrysler executives, including Wolfgang Bernhard, the chief operating officer.
2002-12-16	Economy & Business; Big 3 Automakers Are Likely to Swerve Into the Slow Lane	HEADING into this year, a question hung over the Motor City: Could the boom-time sales pace of recent years, fueled by the mighty growth of sport utilities, possibly continue? The answer for much of 2002 was a resounding yes. So now analysts are asking the same question about 2003. And this time even auto executives are bracing for a slump.
2002-12-04	Big Three's Auto Sales Fell Sharply in November	Sales at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company fell sharply in November from robust levels a year ago, and stocks of both companies were battered today. Many investors are concerned about the prospect of slumping industry sales next year, which even the automakers are expecting, coupled with increasing competition as foreign carmakers open more plants in the United States and continue to encroach on the lucrative pickup and sport utility market.
2002-11-27	Ford Motor Is Linked to Argentina's 'Dirty War'	Pedro Troiani was at work on the assembly line at the Ford Motor plant here one morning in April 1976 when more than a dozen heavily armed men burst into the factory and made their way toward him, he recalled recently. At gunpoint, he said, he was paraded through the plant and driven in a company truck to a soccer field in the factory complex where, he said, the Argentine Army had set up a barracks and detention center.
2002-11-26	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Daimlerchrysler Cuts	DaimlerChrysler said that it was talking to worker representatives about cutting almost 800 jobs, or a tenth of the work force, at a commercial vehicle plant in Mannheim, Germany. The move would affect only the plant's cable activities, which have high production costs, a spokesman said.
2002-11-26	Chrysler to Sell Diesel Jeeps in the U.S.	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler will sell Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicles with diesel engines in the United States starting in 2004 as it seeks to improve the average fuel economy of the cars it sells. The automaker expects to sell about 5,000 of the Jeeps in the first year it offers the 2.8-liter diesel engine made by DaimlerChrysler's Detroit Diesel Corporation. The unit provides the engines for European models of the Jeep, known there as the Cherokee, Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's chief executive, said at a New York conference on auto technology.
2002-11-24	The Nation: The Price of Success; Now, Add God to the List of Enemies of the S.U.V.	IT'S not often you see a rabbi being chauffeured by a nun in a car emblazoned with the slogan ''What Would Jesus Drive?'' But such was the scene last week, when a coalition of Christian and Jewish religious leaders came here to press automakers for more fuel-efficient vehicles, and were ferried between General Motors and the Ford Motor Company by a convoy of nuns driving the Toyota Prius, a small car that combines gas and electric power. The slogan, which attracted much attention, was the work of Evangelical Environmental Network, a small grassroots group.
2002-11-19	A Group Links Fuel Economy To Religion	A broad coalition of religious groups is preparing a grass-roots campaign linking fuel efficiency to morality, with some ads going so far as to ask: ''What Would Jesus Drive?'' Leaders of the effort are coming to Detroit on Wednesday to meet with William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. They will also meet with executives at General Motors.
2002-11-10	Private Sector; Still Lots of Mileage on This Grudge	Time for the latest chapter in Kirk Kerkorian versus Jürgen Schrempp.
2002-11-07	CHRYSLER RECALLS 500,000 MINIVANS TO REPLACE PART	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler recalled 500,000 minivans to replace a part that can cause the air bag, horn or cruise control to fail, and added a lifetime warranty on the part for 1.3 million more of the vehicles. Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler minivans from 1996 to 1998 have a part called a clock spring that may have been improperly installed, a spokeswoman, Angela Spencer Ford, said. Motorists will be alerted to a malfunction by the air bag warning light, she said. The clock spring powers some parts within the steering wheel. The automaker had 27 recalls in 2001, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
2002-11-05	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Luxury Car Is Delayed	DaimlerChrysler will delay the deliveries of its new Maybach luxury models until the end of the year, citing dissatisfaction with some of the parts delivered by suppliers. Sales were planned to start in October 2002 in Germany and at the beginning of 2003 in the United States. DaimlerChrysler has orders for a full-year's production of 1,000 cars, 40 percent of which are to be sold in the United States. The $308,000 Maybach 57 and the $357,000 Maybach 62 will compete with Volkswagen's Bentley and BMW's Rolls-Royce. Separately, in Brazil, DaimlerChrysler said that it would build a four-seat version of its Smart subcompact at a Brazilian plant. Ben van Schaik, president of DaimlerChrysler Brazil, said the Brazilian plant would be the first outside Europe to build the Smart.
2002-11-05	Can Celine Dion help Chrysler rebound? The automaker is betting millions that she can.	CELINE DION was able to sell a movie about a sinking ship. But can she sell a Chrysler? And can Chrysler sell her? The Chrysler Group on Tuesday will announce a broad-based partnership with Celine Dion, the 34-year-old French Canadian chanteuse, and Sony Music Entertainment that will include appearances in advertisements, cross promotions of her music with the cars and even a special Chrysler song she will croon. The terms of the three-year deal were not disclosed, though it will pay Ms. Dion in the tens of millions of dollars.
2002-11-01	Big Three Carmakers Expect Sharp Drop in Monthly Sales	Carmakers are expecting a sharp falloff when they report October sales on Friday, and some analysts fear that a second consecutive month of slumping results could indicate an end to boom times for auto sales. Many analysts have been cutting back their expectations for October throughout the month, and J. D. Power & Associates is forecasting sales at the lowest monthly rate in four years.
2002-10-28	Pain-and-Suffering Awards Let Juries Avoid New Limits	Linda M. Gilbert works as a millwright at the DaimlerChrysler Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit. A millwright is a sort of troubleshooter. The work is hard, it pays well, and it is unusual to see a woman doing it. In 1999, a jury in Detroit found that Ms. Gilbert's male colleagues had harassed her for years with pornographic messages, vulgar talk and insults. It awarded her $21 million. The award is the largest affirmed for an individual sexual harassment plaintiff in United States history.
2002-10-26	A $58.5 MILLION VERDICT AGAINST CHRYSLER IS OVERTURNED	A Pennsylvania appeals court overturned a $58.5 million verdict against DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Corporation unit for vehicle owners who said they were injured by defective air bags. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania ruled yesterday that the suit should not have been granted class-action status. The case was brought on behalf of about 75,000 state residents who owned Chrysler vehicles with air bags that were said to have caused hand burns in wrecks, the company said.
2002-10-24	U.S. Carmakers Losing Ground To Imports Despite Deals	The billions of dollars that General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have spent during the last year on the most generous sales incentives in automotive history have not bought them what they wanted: a bigger share of the market. The latest offers -- for everything from Chevrolet Cavaliers to Cadillac Escalades and Ford Focuses to Jaguar S-Types -- include zero percent loans, with no money down and no monthly payments until 2003, or else thousands of dollars in cash rebates. The deals are available not only on leftover 2002 models, but also on the newest cars and trucks.
2002-10-24	DaimlerChrysler Has Big Profit Gain, but Is Pessimistic	DaimlerChrysler said today that net income more than tripled during the third quarter because of aggressive cost-cutting at Chrysler and elsewhere in its operations. But it issued a pessimistic forecast for sales of cars and light trucks in the United States next year, blaming economic and political uncertainty. Further, DaimlerChrysler said it expected to have an underfunded pension liability of $3 billion for North America by the end of the year, sharing in the woes that have afflicted General Motors and Ford Motor as falling stock prices reduce the investments that feed their retirement funds.
2002-10-23	Mercedes's Man in Detroit Wants to Give Chrysler Some Import Magic	DURING his first month as Chrysler's chief executive, with the auto company drowning in debt, Dieter Zetsche, newly arrived here from Germany, went to a Costco in search of batteries. Bewildered by the vast choices, he eventually found what he wanted, only to be stymied at the cash register when a clerk asked him for his membership card. A hand reached out behind him and a voice said, ''Here, Dr. Zetsche, you can use my card.'' It turned out to be a Chrysler employee who had recognized him from the company's internal television network.
2002-10-18	Georgia Wins Bidding War For a DaimlerChrysler Plant	The latest bidding war between Southern states for a new auto manufacturing plant was resolved today in Georgia's favor when DaimlerChrysler said it had chosen a site near Savannah over one near Charleston, S.C., to assemble two types of vans now made only in Germany. Construction of a $754 million assembly plant in Pooler, 12 miles west of Savannah, will start in July, ''barring any unforeseen changes in the economy,'' said Joselyn Butler Baker, a spokeswoman for Gov. Roy Barnes, who announced an agreement in principle with the company this afternoon.
2002-10-16	Europe Pushes for Renewable Energy	Romano Prodi has seen the hydrogen-powered light. In an interview today, Mr. Prodi, the president of the European Commission, described his view of Europe in a post-fossil-fuel era, when homes would generate the power they need from renewable sources like the wind and the sun, store it in hydrogen fuel cells and harness it as needed, replacing all the polluting energy sources in use today.
2002-10-16	Auto Workers and Daimler In Tentative Deal in Canada	Less than a half-hour before picket lines were set to go up at five DaimlerChrysler plants in Canada, the Canadian Auto Workers union said tonight that it had reached a tentative agreement with the company on a new three-year contract covering 13,000 workers. The deal, which will be put to a ratification vote on Sunday, comes after successful negotiations over the last month between the union and the Canadian units of the other two North American carmakers, General Motors and Ford. All three companies have agreed to new contracts that include wage increases of 3 percent in each of the first two years and 2 percent in the third, as well as improved benefits and substantial new investments in Canada.
2002-10-13	Private Sector; A Bit of Snapping and Snarling For Two of Detroit's Top Dogs	Detroit loves a good brawl between automakers, and it looks as if one is brewing between Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, and Robert Lutz, the General Motors vice chairman. The tetchiness began a couple of weeks ago, when Mr. Lutz was quoted by a German newspaper as questioning why Chrysler was promoting a seven-year, 70,000-mile warranty on its vehicles. ''With quality as it is at Chrysler today, I wonder why they did that,'' Mr. Lutz was quoted as saying.
2002-10-13	Fuel Gauge Is Near 'E' For the Big Three	SINCE 9/11, major auto companies have relied heavily on zero percent financing to bolster sales. Worried that such methods have hurt profit margins, however, investors have bid down prices of auto company stocks and bonds. Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, has been bearish on the group since the summer. Last week, he discussed his reasons. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
2002-10-06	This Mercedes Wears a Mask And Flaunts Its Rubber Floor	TESTED: 2002 Freightliner Sprinter WHAT IS IT? -- Full-size commercial van. HOW MUCH? -- $27,024 for cargo van with 118-inch wheelbase and standard roof; $36,065 as tested for passenger van with 140-inch wheelbase and high roof, including comfort package ($1,580) and rear air-conditioning ($1,405).
2002-10-03	CHRYSLER EXPANDS INCENTIVES ON 2003 MODELS	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler is expanding the availability of some no-interest loans and lowering interest rates on other 2003 models as it adjusts its strategy of offering fewer sales incentives than General Motors and Ford Motor, its rivals in the United States. Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker, will offer five-year no-interest loans on minivans and 2.9 percent 60-month loans on all 2003 cars that had carried 4.9 percent financing, said a spokesman, Marc Henretta. Cash rebates rose as high as $2,500 from $1,500, he said.
2002-10-02	Slow September Sales Lead to New Auto Incentives	The robust pace of auto sales slowed in September, causing a fresh round of big incentives from Ford and General Motors and debate from Wall Street about the industry's outlook. Over all, industry sales rose 3.2 percent compared with September 2001, but fell sharply from the strong pace this year. Last month, sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.3 million vehicles, compared with 18.7 million in August and 18.1 million in July, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
2002-09-29	Encore! Rear-Drive Cars Take the Stage Again	THIRTY years ago, the wave of the future was front-wheel drive. Now that wave is heading the other way, as Detroit converts entire car lines back to rear-wheel drive, and other automakers make plans to sprinkle their lineups with new rear-drive models as well. The return to rear drive is a revolution for Chrysler and G.M., which responded to the oil shocks of the 1970's and 80's by shifting to front drive for most of their cars. Because one front-drive advantage is space efficiency -- most drivetrain components are under the hood, and there is no high driveline tunnel to rob interior room -- they were able to maximize space as they developed smaller, less thirsty cars.
2002-09-28	Cars for People With $300,000 Watches	For those people unsatisfied with mass-produced luxury cars, the Paris motor show offered a peek through the window of an even more rarefied world: custom-built automobiles. A tiny market of no more than 8,000 cars a year, it is nevertheless becoming as competitive in its genteel way as the broader luxury business fought over by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Jaguar.
2002-09-21	Daimler Buys Stakes in Asian Trucking	DaimlerChrysler said today that it had taken a double plunge into the Asian truck market, spending $1.14 billion to buy stakes in the truck operations of Hyundai Motor of South Korea and in the Fuso truck division of Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. The two truck businesses will be reorganized as separate companies, and German managers will be dispatched from DaimlerChrysler's other operations to run them, the company said.
2002-09-11	CHRYSLER INCREASES EUROPEAN SALES BY 7.7 PERCENT	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler said it increased its European sales 7.7 percent this year, adding more diesel engines and Mercedes-Benz parts. The biggest increase was from diesel engines in Jeep and Chrysler models, said Thomas Hausch, the unit's executive director of international sales and marketing. Chrysler sold 60,026 cars and trucks in Europe in the year's first half after reaching 110,266 for 2001.
2002-09-06	Digital Link For Car Talk	Techies know about Bluetooth, a digital system that lets electronic devices communicate with each other without a cord running between them (though only over about 30 feet). That's more than enough for the inside of a car, where increasingly there are a lot of devices joining the buzz -- mobile phones, portable hand-held computers, laptops. Someday cellphones may function as modems in cars, bringing in video signals, for example, to be transferred to an onboard player system. But as DaimlerChrysler begins offering UConnect, a Bluetooth-based communication system, in the 2003 model year, its emphasis is on something needed in the here and now -- hands-free telephoning. Bluetooth is essentially radio, operating on an unlicensed broadcast band. UConnect can use it to let an ordinary hand-held cellphone, laid down casually on the seat, work with systems in the car. The driver dials the phone with voice commands and carries on a conversation by talking into a receiver installed in the car. The answering voice comes through the car's built-in speaker system.
2002-09-06	Canadian Union Picks G.M. for First Talks	The union representing 46,000 Canadian auto workers today chose General Motors as its target -- the company that it will negotiate a new labor contract with first, to set a pattern for contracts with the others. But the union indicated that its most serious issues were with Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, not G.M. Announcing the choice to cheering union officials at a Toronto hotel, Buzz Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, said job security remained the union's top concern even though car and truck sales are strong. ''Restructuring, job losses, layoffs and closures are still threats that we're having to face in our bargaining,'' Mr. Hargrove said. The union will also seek ''substantial'' wage increases, he said.
2002-09-05	No-Interest Financing and Rebates Sent Car Sales Up 13.5% in August	The nation's largest automakers reported today that they broke industry sales records in August, fueled by bountiful incentives and a willingness by otherwise wary consumers to spend money on new vehicles. More pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles were sold last month than in any single month in the industry's history. Light trucks, including minivans, made up 51.5 percent of industry sales in August.
2002-08-04	Private Sector; Having Too Much Fun to Leave	Is Robert A. Lutz planning to stick around longer at General Motors than his original three-year plan? At least one high-level hint has been dropped that he plans to do so. Mr. Lutz, 70, legendary for his automotive instincts, joined G.M. a year ago as vice chairman and all-around car czar. Since then, Mr. Lutz, a former Chrysler executive, has whirled through G.M.'s styling studios and engineering labs, putting new vehicles into development, tweaking those he thinks can be saved, killing those he thinks are beyond hope.
2002-08-03	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Luxury Auto Planned	The German car manufacturer DaimlerChrysler expects to sell 150 limousines from its new luxury make Maybach in 2002, the company said. The Maybach will be built in Sindelfingen, where the company makes the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Sales are planned to start in October 2002 in Germany and at the beginning of 2003 in the United States. The price for the Maybach 57 is $303,000, and the Maybach 62 will cost $352,000. In 2003, DaimlerChrysler plans to sell 1,000 limousines, 40 percent of which are to be sold in the United States. The car will compete with Volkswagen's Bentley and BMW's Rolls-Royce, which will be introduced next year. Victor Homola (NYT)
2002-08-02	Car Sales in Surprise Jump, And G.M. Leads the Pack	Car and truck sales in the United States rose a surprising 8.6 percent in July, largely because of aggressive incentives from automakers. The General Motors Corporation reinstated zero-percent financing early last month, a reprise of the incentives it offered after the Sept. 11 attacks. As a result, its combined car and truck sales led the industry, rising by 23.9 percent in July compared with figures for the month a year earlier.
2002-07-30	Auto Companies Make Assignments	Two automotive advertisers made decisions on assignments for advertising aimed at multicultural consumers. Both reviews have prompted criticism from activists like the Rev. Al Sharpton. The Chrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., part of DaimlerChrysler, retained GlobalHue in Southfield, Mich., which is 49 percent owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, as the agency handling its multicultural marketing.
2002-07-28	Private Sector; Chrysler's Numbers? He'd Back Them	Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is hoping for an early flood of signatures by chief executives on documents certifying their financial results. Last week, he got one volunteer who isn't even required by law to sign off: Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Chrysler, part of DaimlerChrysler. ''I have all faith in Chrysler's numbers,'' Mr. Zetsche said.
2002-07-20	Mercedes Faces U.S. Inquiry on Possible Price Fixing	The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into accusations that Mercedes-Benz conspired with 27 dealers to fix prices in the metropolitan New York area, DaimlerChrysler, the parent of Mercedes, said yesterday. The disclosure came in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which DaimlerChrysler gave details of its second-quarter results, which were announced on Thursday. Mercedes is the third-best-selling luxury brand in the United States behind Lexus, owned by Toyota Motor, and BMW.
2002-07-19	Daimler Profit Up 52%; Restrained Optimism for Rest of Year	DaimlerChrysler reported today that its second-quarter profit jumped 52 percent, buoyed by cost-cutting at Chrysler that is running ahead of the company's turnaround plan. Thanks to improved results, Jürgen Schrempp, the chief executive, said Daimler expected its 2002 results to be at least triple the $1.3 billion profit it forecast at the start of the year.
2002-07-17	Canadian Auto Workers Open Talks With the Big 3	The union representing 46,000 Canadian auto workers began talks today with the big three North American automakers on a new labor contract that might set precedents for similar talks next year in the United States. There were signs that the local unit of General Motors would be the union's primary, and most accommodating, target. G.M., Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler all have closely integrated their American and Canadian operations, with assembly lines in each country producing vehicles for the entire North American market. But for the first time in many years, bargaining on labor contracts is not taking place simultaneously in the two countries.
2002-07-08	A campaign using Chrysler's German ties to help its image of quality may backfire, analysts say.	FOUR years after DaimlerBenz acquired Chrysler, the combined company plans for the first time to reckon with the merger in its American advertisements. But Chrysler's embrace of its German parentage might be problematic at a time of increased patriotic fervor.
2002-07-03	G.M. Bucks Detroit Trend And Reports Higher Sales	A day after introducing an aggressive incentive plan, General Motors reported stronger June auto sales today even as sales by its Detroit-based rivals and the rest of the industry sagged. G.M. said its vehicle sales rose 4.3 percent in June compared with figures in the month a year earlier. Its market share climbed both for June and for the first half of 2001, thanks in part to its willingness to continue stimulating the market with incentives. In contrast, sales at DaimlerChrysler dropped 3.6 percent in June, while Ford Motor's sales dropped 10.7 percent.
2002-06-14	G.M. Beat Ford in Efficiency, A Study of Auto Plants Finds	Last year, for the first time since a closely watched study began tracking productivity, General Motors was more efficient than the Ford Motor Company in building cars. But both companies, along with DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, continue to trail Asian competitors in productivity and profitability. The gap remains wide, even though the three major Asian automakers -- Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan -- slipped a bit last year.
2002-05-31	G.M. Rises and Nissan Falls in J.D. Power Quality Survey	General Motors rose to third place in this year's quality ranking surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, the best performance for a domestic manufacturer since the study's methodology was changed in 1998. The Ford Motor Company also rose in the closely watched initial quality survey, which examines how cars perform in their first 90 days, as did DaimlerChrysler, the parent of the Chrysler Group. Ford moved from seventh place to fifth in the survey. DaimlerChrysler moved from fifth to fourth.
2002-05-21	Chrysler Warns About Sales in Canada	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler has started notifying dealers that it will stop honoring warranties for the 2003 model year on new cars and trucks bought in Canada for use in the United States because the sales reduce the automaker's profit. Automakers typically set lower prices in Canada because consumers there have less money to spend than buyers in the United States, said a Chrysler spokesman, Dave Elshoff. When American consumers buy vehicles in Canada, the company loses more profitable sales in the United States, he said. The Honda Motor Company has already taken steps to discourage such purchases, and General Motors is considering action.
2002-05-12	Business; Chrysler Is Trying to Leave Its Baggage Behind	DIETER ZETSCHE, the president of Chrysler, is no longer the most beleaguered man in the Motor City. That mantle he has gladly passed to William Clay Ford Jr., the chief executive of Ford Motor. ''The newspapers write about the one winner and the two losers,'' Mr. Zetsche said in an interview last week, referring to the perception of the Big Three automakers. ''You might see more articles about the two winners and the one loser.''
2002-05-06	Hyundai Joins 2 Automakers In Planning For Engine	Hyundai Motor, the South Korean carmaker, forged an alliance today with DaimlerChrysler of Germany and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan to work on engines that all three companies can use in their cars. The chief executives of the three companies initialed an agreement today to form a company, the Global Engine Alliance, just five days after General Motors signed a contract to take over most of Daewoo Motor in 60 to 90 days.
2002-05-02	Auto Sales Increased 2.9% in April; Only Ford Lagged	Every major automaker except Ford Motor reported sales increases last month, evidence of an economic recovery that helped propel the stock market today. Over all, automobile sales in the United States rose 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
2002-05-01	Chrysler Signs Deal With Martha Stewart	The Chrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., a division of DaimlerChrysler, and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in New York said yesterday that they had signed a multimillion-dollar marketing agreement. As part of the deal, Chrysler products will be advertised in Martha Stewart's media properties, including her magazine, television and radio shows, and Web site. The agreement covers travel-related content and advertising under the theme ''road trips.'' For instance, Chrysler will be the only automotive advertiser in a new monthly Road Trips section of Martha Stewart Living magazine.
2002-04-30	Auto Parts Makers Grinding to a Halt	For decades, Tom Libera stood securely on the first rung of the industrial ladder. Now he may be about to fall off. His small one-story shop, J & T Tool and Die, is surrounded by empty fields, at the base of Saginaw Bay just out of town. Inside, Mr. Libera, 43, shows off some of his wares -- basic elements of manufacturing that meld into the mechanisms of American life.
2002-04-26	DAIMLERCHRYSLER SAYS IT HAS REGAINED PROFITABILITY	DaimlerChrysler said yesterday that it returned to profitability in the first quarter as it stopped losses at the Chrysler division by dismissing workers and closing factories. Net income was 2.7 billion euros ($2.4 billion), or 2.65 euros a share, in contrast to a loss of 2.4 billion euros, or 2.35 euros a share, a year ago. The 2002 figure includes a one-time gain of 2.5 billion euros from an asset sale. In 2001, the company had a full-year loss of 662 million euros. The Chrysler unit had its first adjusted operating profit in a year and a half and may have a profit for the year if demand for new cars remains at current levels, the company said. DaimlerChrysler shares fell 50 cents, to $46.09.
2002-04-26	From 1955, a Car Just for Women (but the Color Is All Wrong!)	IMAGINE tooling down the street in a heather rose (Detroit-speak for pink), two-door hardtop, your hands grasping a pink steering wheel, your body resting comfortably on pink Cordagrain seats. In the back seat is a pink leather purse stuffed with lipstick, comb, vanity mirror and cigarette case, and -- just in case of inclement weather -- there is also a storage bin with a collection of similarly hued rain gear, complete with matching rain boots.
2002-04-20	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Wage Talks Break Down	A powerful German labor union, IG Metall, broke off wage talks in what could be the first step to serious strikes -- rare in Germany. IG Metall had hoped to reach an agreement in the state of Baden-Württemberg, home to DaimlerChyrsler and many large automobile suppliers, but employers rejected the union's reduced demand for a wage increase of 4 percent. IG Metall has been more militant this year, but German industry is taking a hard line. Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party is torn between its political dependence on unions in an election year and its fear of accelerated inflation. Earlier this week, German chemical workers agreed to wage increases of 3.6 percent. Edmund L. Andrews (NYT)
2002-04-11	DaimlerChrysler to Meet 2002 Profit Goals	DaimlerChrysler told shareholders at its annual meeting today that it would meet 2002 earnings goals as its Chrysler division returned to profitability. But the company abandoned goals for 2003, saying it had overestimated economic growth.
2002-04-03	Auto Sales Strong in March as Recovery Continues	Solid auto sales in March pointed to a continuing economic recovery, though domestic automakers have not been able to break the cycle of losing market share to foreign competitors. General Motors, the healthiest of the Big Three automakers, was able to hold its share of the market steady in the first quarter, a victory compared with the struggles of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler. Analysts are growing bullish on G.M. because its sales have also become more profitable. Retail sales have risen while rental car companies and corporate fleets have cut back sharply on less lucrative bulk purchases during the downturn.
2002-03-24	The Cars That Car Designers Like to Look at	IF you want to rub elbows with automobile designers, there's no place like a car show to see the men and women who shaped the look and feel of the car in your driveway. But what do the designers themselves look at when they stroll the exhibition hall? The New York International Auto Show opens to the public on Friday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Earlier in the week, industry movers and shakers (and more than a few designers) will be on hand to unveil their latest dream cars (and real cars) to the press.
2002-03-23	National Briefing | West: California: Automaker Settles Dispute	The DaimlerChrysler Corporation agreed to pay the Department of Motor Vehicles $325,000 to settle eight-year-old charges that the company violated the state's lemon laws. The state accused the automaker of repurchasing and reselling 119 defective vehicles without informing buyers. DaimlerChrysler, which denied any wrongdoing, had faced a 45-day temporary suspension of its license to conduct business in California. Catherine Billey (NYT)
2002-03-12	Big Corporations Combine To Negotiate Airline Fares	Large corporations, frustrated by the cost of travel from airports dominated by a single carrier, are teaming up in several cities to investigate ways to spur competition and negotiate lower fares. The proposals include luring new carriers by guaranteeing corporate bookings; negotiating collectively with the airlines instead of individually to secure lower fares; and setting up air shuttles to frequently visited cities for corporate employees.
2002-03-07	VW Hopes Sports Car Revives Bentley	The lighting was low, the security was high and the artificial fog was thick as Volkswagen executives gave selected visitors a glimpse today of their secret project: the first all-new Bentley since Volkswagen took over Rolls-Royce Motor Cars three years ago. Except for the familiar mesh front grill and the winged logo, the two-door GT did not look like a Bentley. Sleek and low-slung, it looked more like a muscular sports rocket than a hand-crafted luxury touring car.
2002-03-05	Chrysler Seeks to Revive Line With Convertible PT Cruiser	Chrysler said today that it planned to make a convertible version of the PT Cruiser, which was an instant hit when it reached the auto market two years ago but whose luster has since begun to fade. The announcement came at the Geneva International Motor Show, traditionally the place where European manufacturers spotlight their most attractive new vehicles. Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, said the PT convertible would go on sale sometime in 2004 as a two-door, four-seater vehicle. It will be built at the factory in Toluca, Mexico, where Chrysler builds the PT Cruiser.
2002-03-03	Investing; Is It G.M.'s Turn to Be the Favorite?	AS it time to buy General Motors? For years, G.M. was deep in the woodshed of most professional investors. With its market share cut in half since 1960 and with cars described as bland at best, the company was not appealing.
2002-03-01	JUDGE RULES IN G.M.'S FAVOR IN TRADEMARK DISPUTE	The grille of the Hummer H2, made by General Motors, does not violate the trademark design of DaimlerChrysler's Jeep vehicles, a federal judge has ruled. DaimlerChrysler sued G.M. last year, saying the grille of the Hummer H2 sport utility vehicle was too much like the Jeep grille. But Judge Robert Miller Jr. of Federal District Court in South Bend, Ind., said in a ruling posted on the court's Web site, ''Nothing in the record indicates any intent on General Motors' part to palm off the H2 as a Jeep, or to exploit consumers' association with Jeep.'' G.M. has said that changing the grille design would cost $100 million. The H2 is set to go on sale in July.
2002-02-21	DaimlerChrysler Gives Outlook, And Some Analysts Fault Report	DaimlerChrysler executives said today that Chrysler had lost less than expected last year and reiterated that it would break even this year. But financial analysts participating in a two-hour conference call to discuss DaimlerChrysler's fourth-quarter earnings expressed frustration that the company did not offer more specifics about its earnings outlook for this year. In particular, they wanted forecasts about Mercedes and other units, and asked for more details about DaimlerChrysler's changed forecast from the turnaround plan it laid out a year ago.
2002-02-17	Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Toyota	IN the cafeteria, there are sticky rice and hush puppies, soy sauce and ketchup, chopsticks and forks. This is Toyota, bluegrass style.
2002-02-15	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Bombardier Disputes Price Of Adtranz	Bombardier Inc. demanded 1 billion euros ($870 million) from DaimlerChrysler, contending the carmaker overstated the value of the Adtranz train unit sold to the Canadian company last year. The carmaker did not disclose 850 million euros in costs from contractual obligations to third parties, said Dominique Dionne, a spokeswoman for Bombardier, which paid $752 million for the unit in cash and assumed debt. The contention is ''baseless,'' a DaimlerChrysler board member, Manfred Bischoff, said. The companies said the dispute would go to arbitration rather than court.
2002-02-08	Jeep to Hummer: Wipe That Grin Off Your Face	Tt is not Tyson vs. Lewis, but Jeep and Hummer bared their teeth this week in United States District Court in South Bend, Ind. DaimlerChrysler, which owns Jeep, asked Judge Robert L. Miller to temporarily bar General Motors and AM General, which build and distribute Hummers under a partnership agreement, from selling their ''baby Hummer'' unless they change its Jeeplike grille. The Hummer H2 is to reach dealers in July. DaimlerChrysler wants sales delayed until the court hears a trademark-infringement suit -- or H2 gets a nose job. The company says the grille, with seven openings, is too similar to Jeep's 60-year-old design.
2002-02-07	DaimlerChrysler Dividend May Be Cut More Than Half	The management board at DaimlerChrysler proposed today that the company's dividend be cut by more than half in the first reduction since the merger of DaimlerBenz and Chrysler in 1998. The company also announced that earnings this year would be much less than previously forecast. And it reported a net loss for last year.
2002-01-18	Chrysler withdraws a Jeep ad after deer hunters take offense.	HUNTERS have gone after a commercial instead of a critter. A Jeep spot that showed a deer hunter boldly rescuing his prey by fooling his fellow hunters has been taken off the air after numerous complaints from hunters.
2002-01-12	FORD PLANS TO CUT 35,000 EMPLOYEES AND SHUT 5 PLANTS	The Ford Motor Company announced its most sweeping cutbacks in two decades today, terminating 35,000 workers, closing five plants and dropping four models. No longer will the company make Lincoln Continentals or Ford Escorts, as it cuts North American capacity by nearly a million cars and trucks a year.
2002-01-12	DaimlerChrysler Speeds Sale Of Stake in Software Venture	DaimlerChrysler has forced Deutsche Telekom to buy out its interest in Debis Systemhaus, a software joint venture, for 4.6 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in cash, two years earlier than planned. Both companies need cash. DaimlerChrysler has $16 billion in debt due this year and needs to invest to turn around its unprofitable Chrysler unit in North America. Deutsche Telekom is Europe's most indebted phone company, with 66 billion euros ($58.9 billion) owed, mainly because of acquisitions.
2002-01-05	Toyota Says It Will Build Mexico Plant	The Toyota Motor Company announced plans yesterday to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico, a move analysts described as crucial to Toyota's attempt to displace Chrysler as the third-best-selling auto company in the United States market. Toyota was evasive about its plans for the plant, which would be built on a 700-acre site outside Tijuana in Baja California. The carmaker said the plant, which is expected to open in 2004, would make truck beds for pickup trucks built at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., its plant in Fremont, Calif., that is a joint venture with General Motors.
2002-01-04	Incentives Prop Up Sales but May Haunt Carmakers Later	Auto sales, propelled by low-cost financing, finished the year slightly below a record set in 2000, according to data released today. But expectations for 2002 are pessimistic because of the economy as well as the dent that the incentives have probably made in demand. Carmakers ended 2001 with sales of about 17.1 million vehicles, down slightly from the record 17.3 million in sales a year earlier. Few analysts expected such a strong performance last summer, when industry sales were lagging, and the Sept. 11 attacks all but halted showroom traffic.
2001-12-30	Private Sector; A Return to Extravagance by Chrysler	Amid all the invitations descending on the automotive media for the Detroit Auto Show next weekend, one is particularly intriguing. Chrysler has rented a 1929 red-brick firehouse near the show site, the Cobo Exhibition Center, and is turning it into a big party space where Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's chief executive, and other senior managers will be tending bar. This is not the first time Chrysler has put on an extravagant party at the show. Two years ago, Chrysler turned an old warehouse into a swing-dance nightclub at a reported cost of $2 million. Given the rate at which Chrysler's fortunes are evaporating, the bartending practice might be useful in case any of the company's executives are looking for work soon. Micheline Maynard
2001-12-05	Honda Opens a U.S. Factory and a Front Against the Big 3	Top executives of Honda Motor criticized the Big Three today for what they view as a double standard on fuel economy. The executives said that domestic manufacturers were not willing to face the environmental implications of becoming increasingly reliant on sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles. ''Business and some social obligation have to be equally applied to the whole company,'' said Koichi Amemiya, chief executive of Honda's American operations, who was in Alabama to open a minivan assembly plant.
2001-12-04	Despite Ills, Automakers Report Solid Sales for November	Auto sales remained strong for much of November but began to slow after Thanksgiving, when the Big Three automakers started to restrict their interest-free financing offers. Still, the nation's auto industry remains on pace for what should be at least the third- or possibly the second-biggest sales year ever. General Motors said yesterday that it would increase first-quarter production by 7 percent to replenish a stock of vehicles diminished by record October sales and a strong November. G.M., the world's largest automaker, also said it would step up production by about 15,000 vehicles this quarter, and it said the increase would have a favorable effect on earnings projections.
2001-12-02	By Any Name, It's the Mercedes of Cargo Vans	ARE American tradesmen and delivery people ready for the Sprinter commercial van by Mercedes-Benz? My plumber would appear to be; he motored up in a vintage 560 SL roadster to give an estimate for a new bathroom. Given the size of that estimate, he may be able to afford several Sprinters. Alas, if he should decide to haul his drain snakes and pipe wrenches in one, he will have to make do without a three-pointed star on the grille. The new work van will carry the name of Freightliner, the American truck subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, along with badges that say, ''Powered by Mercedes-Benz.''
2001-11-28	Vehicle Sales Stayed Robust In November	Auto sales have remained surprisingly strong this month easing the recession, economists say, and possibly shortening it, with automakers beginning to announce plans to increase production more than initially expected early next year to rebuild inventories. November's robust sales, after October's record pace, have been driven by a wave of interest-free financing offers from the Big Three, which have been good news for car buyers with good credit and have attracted many others to dealerships. And the incentives, by increasing consumer spending, have brought hopeful tidings to a bleak economy.
2001-11-24	A Quest to Promote the Quality Of Cars Made in South Africa	When Günter Butschek, chief manufacturing executive for DaimlerChrysler South Africa, began his presentation in Tokyo last year, he knew how much South Africa stood to lose. His challenge was to persuade his colleagues to embrace luxury cars assembled in South Africa with the same enthusiasm they had long shown for shipments from Germany. With typical Japanese politesse, they had bowed and exchanged business cards with him. But soon they got to the point. A company-commissioned survey, they told him, found that many of the carmaker's best customers in Japan would balk at buying a Mercedes-Benz built at a plant in the southeastern port city of East London, which for decades had produced cars almost exclusively for South Africa itself.
2001-11-12	Miscellany	* Taylor Nelson Sofres, London, which owns companies like CMR, the ad-spending tracking service, agreed to acquire TES, Los Angeles, composed of Theatrical Entertainment Services and RapidCheck Reporting, for an initial cash payment of $37.9 million and a maximum final price of $76 million. * The Chrysler Group, Auburn Hills, Mich., part of DaimlerChrysler, signed an agreement with AOL Time Warner, New York, for a multimedia advertising program carrying the theme ''Home for the Holidays.'' Terms were not disclosed. There will be television, print and online ads in AOL Time Warner properties. The agreement expands previous, separate deals between DaimlerChrysler and America Online, Time Inc. and the Turner Broadcasting System.
2001-11-11	The Warranty War Heats Up	THE fortunes of Kia and Hyundai markedly improved after those Korean companies, now part of the same corporate family, began offering extra-long warranties. In recent weeks, as the incentive wars have escalated, other automakers have beefed up their warranties. To ease concern over the quality of their cars, Kia and Hyundai instituted a bumper-to-bumper warranty of five years or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first, and powertrain coverage for 10 years or 100,000 miles.
2001-11-05	Machine-Made Links Change the Way Minds Can Work Together	MODERN science is accustomed to bigness. In five years, the world's most powerful particle accelerator will be in operation at the CERN physics laboratory outside Geneva. The $4 billion accelerator will give physicists the tools they need to search for scientific prizes like the elusive Higgs boson, a particle believed to be the origin of mass and weight in the universe. But when the accelerator starts up, scientists will not necessarily need to travel to Switzerland to conduct their experiments. Instead, they will be able to work together remotely, using a federally financed project called the Grid Physics Network, or GriPhyN (pronounced GRIFF-in), a system that can be used in real time by researchers working on experiments that require vast amounts of computational power.
2001-10-24	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Booming Car Sales, but at a Price	Corporate earnings are plummeting, unemployment is rising, consumer confidence is shaky, the country is at a war footing at home and abroad. Yet auto sales have rarely been better. Come again?
2001-10-24	Daimler Says Chrysler Lost Less Than Expected	DaimlerChrysler A.G. gave investors their first positive surprise in nearly two years today, reporting that third-quarter losses at the Chrysler group had been lower than expected and saying that it can still meet an overall profit goal set earlier this year. Chrysler's operating loss was $243 million, less than half what many analysts had predicted, though Chrysler's sales and its share of the market both declined.
2001-10-18	G.M. Extending Incentives As Ford Posts Another Loss	General Motors today extended interest-free financing deals on its vehicles through mid-November, escalating a price war with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group that began last month. There were signs today that the rising incentive costs were taking their toll. Ford reported a third-quarter net loss of $692 million, posting a second consecutive quarter of losses for the first time in nearly a decade. The loss was in line with analysts' estimates.
2001-10-13	DAIMLERCHRYSLER SETS CUTBACKS AT FREIGHTLINER	DaimlerChrysler A.G., the largest truckmaker, said it would cut 2,700 jobs, close as many as three plants and take a $330 million charge in the fourth quarter to try to return its Freightliner truck unit to profitability. The unit -- the maker of Freightliner, Western Star and Sterling trucks -- will eliminate 1,600 union workers and 1,100 salaried positions, bringing the work force down to 11,700, a reduction of more than half since 1999. Freightliner, based in Portland, Ore., expects to cut about $850 million in costs annually by 2004. The truck unit has been hurt by a drop in demand as the economy slowed. DaimlerChrysler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, has also been hurt by a contractual obligation to repurchase trucks from customers for fixed prices.
2001-10-11	A Buyer's Market for Autos Is a Tough Development for Chrysler	Dieter Zetsche is holding an arm's length pair of cardboard scissors. The Romeo High School band has played ''The Star Spangled Banner.'' A big American flag is unfurled into a cloudy sky. Veterans salute and a pastor prays. Now it's time for Mr. Zetsche, the chief executive of the Chrysler Group, to cut the big red ribbon stretching over the entrance of Orchard Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, a new dealership nestled next to a Fashion Bug and a Farmer Jack, several miles north of Detroit. For Mr. Zetsche, 48, an affable, slim German with small, rounded glasses perched over a walrus mustache, cutting the ribbon is the easy part.
2001-10-10	Europeans Expected to Fine Daimler in Antitrust Case	The European Commission is expected to impose a fine Wednesday on DaimlerChrysler A.G. as it concludes a five-year antitrust investigation of the German carmaker. DaimlerChrysler was accused in 1999 of violating union rules by preventing its exclusive dealer networks in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain from selling Mercedes passenger cars to nonresidents of those countries, in an effort to stem the tide of shoppers seeking cheaper prices abroad.
2001-10-05	Big Loss at Nissan Seems to Undercut U.A.W. Objectives	The United Auto Workers thought that the Nissan workers in Smyrna, Tenn., would be the ones to finally unionize a foreign automaker's plant and provide a crucial first step in turning the U.A.W.'s fortunes around. Instead, the union was dealt a bitter defeat on Wednesday in a battle it had expected to win, or at least closely contest. The margin of defeat has surprised the auto industry and labor unions alike. Nissan employees rejected U.A.W. representation by a 2-to-1 vote, no better than in the union's failed attempt to organize the same plant in 1989.
2001-10-03	Auto Sales Off in September, But Less Than Expected	United States auto sales slumped last month, but were better than analysts expected. A drought in auto sales after the attacks has already led to additional belt-tightening for an industry that was trimming as the economy worsened. Now, analysts say demand will plunge more sharply, leading to more production cuts, plant closings and layoffs.
2001-09-28	DAIMLERCHRYSLER EXTENDS CHIEF'S CONTRACT	DaimlerChrysler said yesterday that its supervisory board had extended the contract of its chief executive, Jürgen E. Schrempp, through April 2005 to ensure continuity atop the company. DaimlerChrysler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, said Jürgen Hubbert, a board member who heads the Mercedes-Benz car division, would also stay through 2005. ''With the key players Jürgen Schrempp and Jürgen Hubbert, continuity and stability is guaranteed,'' Hilmar Kopper, chairman of the supervisory board, said in a statement. ''Within the next few years, the appointment of younger candidates as members of the board of management will have priority.''
2001-09-27	Deutsche Bank Puts Off Sale of Its Daimler Stake	Deutsche Bank said today that it had shelved a plan to sell part of its 12 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler. Shares of Daimler have slumped 27 percent since the terror attacks in the United States. ''We sold some significant stakes last year, and we've always said the next one we're thinking about is DaimlerChrysler,'' Clemens Boersig, the bank's chief financial officer, said at a Berlin seminar. ''At the current market price, that's not really an issue.''
2001-09-10	Jeep's manufacturer seeks to capitalize on the vehicle's featured role in 'Band of Brothers.'	AT first glance, it looks to be the most elaborate product-placement deal since Madison Avenue was a dirt road. During the 10 parts of ''Band of Brothers,'' the World War II mini-series that began running last night on HBO, there are so many scenes featuring the vehicles now sold under the Jeep brand name by the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler that no one from HBO or Chrysler seems to have an exact count.
2001-09-05	Detroit's Big Three May Shuffle as Chrysler Struggles	General Motors. Ford. Toyota? The overseas assault on Detroit's Big Three continued yesterday as the Chrysler Group reported that its August sales fell 24 percent from the year-earlier period. That surprised analysts and led some to wonder if the continuing sales gains by Toyota Motor would lead it to become the nation's third-largest automaker, vaulting past Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
2001-08-31	Auto Parts du Jour; Suppliers Are Forced To Learn Flexibility	Long before she receives the latest orders from General Motors and other big customers, Bonnie Sliker has a pretty good idea what they are going to say. Ms. Sliker, general supervisor of the orders and scheduling group at the big Delphi Automotive Systems parts plant in Rochester, makes her own projections by reading trade journals, talking to her contacts throughout the industry and even by watching television news.
2001-08-31	A Year Later, Some of the Thrill Is Gone	IN a year, the Chrysler PT Cruiser has gone from a boil to a simmer. Last summer, dealers had nine-month waiting lists for PT's, if they were taking names and deposits at all. And many were charging thousands of dollars above the sticker price. This year, the wait is just two months, Chrysler says, and in some parts of the country it is possible to walk into a dealership and drive a PT Cruiser home.
2001-08-28	CHRYSLER TO INTRODUCE FOUR LOWER-PRICED MINIVANS	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler announced yesterday that it would add four lower-priced minivan models by October. The 2002 models, to begin production next month, are the Chrysler Voyager eC, Dodge Caravan eC, Chrysler Town & Country eL and Dodge Grand Caravan eL, the Chrysler Group said. With the additions, Chrysler will have 21 minivan models. Chrysler is the largest seller of minivans, though it faces increasing competition. It has reported sales of 270,179 minivans in the United States in the first seven months of this year, down 10 percent from the period a year ago.
2001-08-12	Scenes From A Marriage	The Daimler-Chrysler merger is similar, in many ways, to the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. An elite, old-line company, Daimler-Benz, had asked for the hand of a beautiful, populist bride, the Chrysler Corporation, and its petition had been accepted. It was a dream match -- a ''wedding made in heaven,'' as Daimler's C.E.O., Jürgen Schrempp, called it in May 1998. The wedding party -- among it, Wall Street and its analysts and even major stockholders like the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian -- was enthusiastic. The new company's shares rose to a dream high of $108.62 a few months after its stock was first traded on Nov. 17, 1998. By this spring, the dream couple had undergone a remarkable transformation. The American bride had apparently vanished; or, to be more precise, she had turned into a German with a bald spot and a mustache. To American ears, the name of the Chrysler division's new German C.E.O., Dieter Zetsche, sounded more like ''Mrs. Thatcher'' than like ''Princess Di.'' Daimler still looked terrific, but Chrysler was all gloom and doom. ''We have to face facts,'' said Jürgen Schrempp, by then the chairman of DaimlerChrysler. ''The U.S. situation has taken a serious turn for the worse.''
2001-08-09	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Daimlerchrysler To Offer At&t Wireless	DaimlerChrysler reached an agreement with AT&T Wireless yesterday to widen the offering of wireless communications services in its vehicles sold in North America. The deal calls for AT&T Wireless to develop voice and data communication services for Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner vehicles. DaimlerChrysler, like other car manufacturers, is seeking to increase the sophistication of wireless services in its vehicles. Terms of the agreement with AT&T Wireless were not disclosed. Simon Romero (NYT)
2001-08-02	Domestic Auto Sales Fell 6% in July	Auto sales in the United States fell 6 percent in July as the slowing economy and the continued struggles of domestic automakers dampened sales. The falloff from figures in the month a year earlier comes after a surprisingly strong first half of the year that surpassed expectations.
2001-07-21	Chrysler Loss Isn't as Deep As Expected	DaimlerChrysler said today that its Chrysler unit lost $125 million in the second quarter, a better performance than analysts had predicted because of stronger auto sales and gains from a turnaround plan. Chrysler earned $986 million in the period a year earlier. The second-quarter performance, which translated to 148 million euros, was markedly better than that of the first quarter, when Chrysler lost $1.2 billion.
2001-07-13	Chrysler to Speed Process For Designing New Vehicles	Chrysler announced a plan today aimed at both speeding the introduction of new vehicles and encouraging its staff to embrace innovative thinking. It is the first major change in the way Chrysler develops vehicles since the auto company, part of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, adopted platform teams in 1989. The changes, which were discussed at a news conference at Chrysler's United States headquarters here, come just a week before DaimlerChrysler is scheduled to release its second-quarter financial results.
2001-07-05	Preliminary Review Is Begun For Jeep Grand Cherokees	The Transportation Department has opened a preliminary investigation into complaints from owners of Jeep Grand Cherokees that the vehicles have shifted on their own from park into reverse while they were idling or even shut down. The vehicles under investigation were made by what is now the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler of Germany for the 1995 through 1999 model years.
2001-06-17	The Way We Live Now: 6-17-01: PHENOMEN; The Smart Way	Americans are proud of our supersize way of life -- from our biggie fries to our gargantuan S.U.V.'s. But with gas prices likely to top $3 a gallon and growing gridlock in our cities, could the time be right for a radically downsized car? MCC Smart GmbH -- a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler -- hopes so. It's considering bringing its ultracompact cars Stateside. Two and a half years after its introduction, the MCC Smart, a two-seater that's about eight feet long and five feet wide, is already changing the way Europeans commute, drive and park. The whimsical bubble-shaped car is the brainchild of Mercedes engineers and Swatch designers. ''In Paris and Nice, all the women are wearing them,'' says talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael, who bought a ''psychedelic'' neon green Smart last year. ''And I mean wearing them.''
2001-06-10	Private Sector; Answering His Own Tough Questions	Dieter Zetsche, the Chrysler Group president, assumed that he would be pelted with questions last week when he addressed the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit. After all, Chrysler's fortunes have plummeted since the 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler that was supposed to create a global powerhouse. DaimlerChrysler executives in Germany have come in for local wrath because the deal did not turn out to be the promised ''merger of equals.''
2001-05-20	Investing; Why Funds See Daimler as a Trade-In	DAIMLERCHRYSLER is not a marriage in which American mutual fund managers have had much faith. Since the completion of the 1998 acquisition of Chrysler by Germany's Daimler-Benz, portfolio managers here have jettisoned shares of the combined company as they have bulked up on stakes in General Motors and Ford Motor. Now the extent of American institutions' disillusionment is clearer. Well over half of the American mutual funds that owned Chrysler at the end of 1997 have sold it, according to data from Morningstar Inc.
2001-05-16	Study Says Height Makes S.U.V.'s Dangerous in Collisions	The height that sport utility vehicles ride off the ground, more than their stiffness or the height of their bumpers, is causing them to inflict unusually heavy damage on cars that they hit in crashes, an insurance industry group said today. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a group financed by insurers that seeks to reduce the cost of crash claims, took particular aim at the Mercedes M-Class sport utility vehicle, produced by DaimlerChrysler. Introduced in late 1997, the M-Class was the first sport utility promoted by its manufacturer as limiting the damage caused to cars.
2001-05-13	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chrysler Sebring convertible; Like Summer, Sunny and Mild	A WARM Michigan spring prompted the early arrival of blooming flowers, budding trees and convertibles emerging from winter storage. Spring brings births, too, and there are some newborns in the convertible nursery, with other deliveries set for later this year and next. Several of these -- the 2002 Lexus SC 430 that recently went on sale, the reborn Ford Thunderbird coming this fall, a Cadillac roadster due in 2002 -- are on the pricey side.
2001-05-13	At Annual Meetings Around the World, the Shots Aren't Heard; Lots of Pastry, Sound and Fury	Hilmar Kopper, chairman of the supervisory board of DaimlerChrysler, lost his patience about five hours into the company's annual shareholder meeting.
2001-05-10	Daimler Rebuffs Kerkorian's Suit in Chrysler Deal	Strongly defending the way in which the Chrysler Corporation became a German-run subsidiary, DaimlerChrysler A.G. filed a motion today to dismiss a lawsuit by Kirk Kerkorian, the corporate raider who tried to buy Chrysler nearly six years ago. Mr. Kerkorian's holding company, the Tracinda Corporation, filed the suit on Nov. 27 in United States District Court in Wilmington, Del. The suit argued that the combination of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz in May 1998 had been presented by Daimler and its top officers as a ''merger of equals,'' but was really a plan to turn Chrysler into little more than a Daimler division.
2001-05-02	Auto Sales Were Down Last Month	Auto sales fell in April, providing the first important indicator of the economy's condition early in the second quarter and a sign that weakening consumer confidence is beginning to affect spending on high-price products. The auto industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.6 million vehicles, down 10 percent from a year earlier. Sales in April were a little higher than what the auto industry considers to be the long-term demand for new automobiles but below the annual rate of 17.2 million cars and light trucks in the first quarter.
2001-05-01	Goodyear Cuts Jobs In Mexico	Gonzalo Ugalde Gámez, a 68-year-old union leader whose right eye hunkers down into a mean slit during moments of brutal honesty, took the lectern before a smoke-filled auditorium of 1,357 Goodyear tire makers to deliver bad news. ''I'm here with you today to inform you,'' Mr. Ugalde began, leaning on one elbow, right eye crashing down, ''that the plant is closed, and it will not open again.''
2001-04-26	DaimlerChrysler Posts Big Quarterly Loss	DaimlerChrysler said today that it lost another $1.2 billion at Chrysler in the first quarter, not including nearly $3 billion in revamping charges, but its results were slightly better than both the company and most analysts had predicted. Over all, the German-American automobile company said it had an operating loss of $3.3 billion, virtually all of that stemming from problems at Chrysler and at the American truck-making subsidiary, Freightliner.
2001-04-24	For Chrysler These Days, It May Be Robots or Mexico	Drive up Interstate 75 here and you pass first the old Jeep Wrangler factory, with some of its yellow-brick walls dating back a century, and then the new Jeep Liberty factory, a gleaming, just-completed structure of steel and glass that covers an area the size of 38 football fields. Walk inside the two factories and the differences are even greater. The old factory relies heavily on manual labor. The new one has laser-guided robot forklifts that carry auto parts to the assembly line, and there is virtually no one in a large area where long-necked robots, orange and 10 feet tall, assemble and weld the Jeeps' metal skeletons.
2001-04-18	KOREA: AUTO WOES	The Hyundai Motor Company is denying a report in Automotive News that its partnership with DaimlerChrysler is in jeopardy. A Hyundai spokesman said that talks were continuing on a joint production deal and that DaimlerChrysler had no plans to sell its 10 percent stake in Hyundai. At the Daewoo Motor Company, which creditors are trying to rescue from bankruptcy and sell to General Motors, strikers won the sympathy of South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, who said he was ''ashamed'' of the harsh police conduct in a crackdown on protests plant in Inchon last week in which 45 workers were injured.

2001-04-13	701,000 DODGE TRUCKS RECALLED BECAUSE OF HOOD LATCH	DaimlerChrysler is recalling 701,000 Dodge Ram pickup trucks in 20 states because a spring on a hood latch can corrode and cause the hood to fly up. The recall is for 1994 through 1999 models in states where there is salt on the roads from either ice removal or the ocean. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said that the states were Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri as well as the District of Columbia. Dealers will replace the secondary hood latch.
2001-04-11	Cutbacks by Daimler Leave A Bitter Residue at Chrysler	When word emerged a month ago that Chrysler burned through $5 billion in cash last year, the radio talk show host David Newman wondered aloud what had happened. ''How can money disappear like that?'' he asked on the local powerhouse, WJR-AM. ''I simply didn't know, and I still don't know.'' But his callers knew where to lay blame: at Chrysler's German parent, DaimlerChrysler A.G. Speculation flew that management had siphoned away the money to help keep its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi, afloat and to pay for projects at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart.
2001-04-07	Corrections	A chart in Business Day on Thursday showing vehicle sales in the United States in March misstated car sales for three companies -- Honda, DaimlerChrysler and Nissan. It also misstated Daimler's light truck sales and overall industry sales. A corrected chart appears today on Page C4.
2001-04-05	Alternatives Sought On Big Auto Races	DaimlerChrysler A.G., Fiat S.p.A. and other carmakers that sponsor Formula One teams said today that they would set up an alternative to the motor races because their new owner plans to move some events to pay television. The move occurred after Kirch Holding G.m.b.H., a German media company that paid $987.5 million Feb. 28 for joint control of 75 percent of Formula One, said it would consider moving some races to a pay-television channel.
2001-04-04	Rebates Help Vehicle Sales Remain Strong	Automakers continued to sell a surprising number of cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in March, despite a slowing economy and falling stock markets. But these sales did not come cheap, as manufacturers extended rebates and other discounts to models that seldom carried them last year. The auto industry sold family vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 17.1 million vehicles, according to sales figures released by all the major automakers today. That was well above the rate of 16 million vehicles that the industry regards as strong, although the number of vehicles sold was still 4 percent lower than the extraordinary number a year earlier.
2001-04-04	RAIL ACQUISITION APPROVED	The European Commission said it had conditionally approved the $725 million acquisition of the DaimlerChrysler rail unit Adtranz by Bombardier of Montreal. The deal would create the world's biggest producer of railway equipment. The commission said the companies had agreed to license other companies to ensure that independent producers continued to sell regional light-rail trains and trams in Germany, now that Adtranz is disappearing.
2001-03-27	CHRYSLER RESTRUCTURES SALES AND SERVICE OPERATION	DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s Chrysler Group restructured its sales and service organization to create five regional business centers in the United States, giving them power to make decisions in local markets. The automaker will let the centers determine vehicle content, sales incentives and marketing because customer demands vary in the regions, the company said. The centers are in Detroit, New York, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Orlando, Fla. They will employ a total of about 110 people, all shifted from existing offices. Chrysler's 25 zone offices will continue to operate.
2001-03-06	Lernout Is Restarting Talks With Daimler on Sale of Unit	The beleaguered Belgian software maker Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products is about to reopen discussions with DaimlerChrysler about a sale of its automotive software unit, according to Lernout's new chief executive, Philippe Bodson. Talks with DaimlerChrysler were initiated by Jo Lernout, one of the company's founders, late last year but were halted when Mr. Bodson took over the effort to rescue Lernout & Hauspie from bankruptcy six weeks ago.
2001-03-02	Vehicle Sales Held Strong Last Month	American consumers continued to flock to car dealerships in February despite the economic slowdown, producing another unexpectedly strong month for auto sales. Sales fell 6 percent last month from February 2000, but the year-earlier month had been one of the best in the industry's history because of lavish incentives. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.5 million vehicles, in an industry that considers anything above 16 million vehicles to be an excellent month.
2001-03-01	Daimler Says Its Huge Vehicle Is More Truck Than S.U.V.	At 9 feet 7 inches and 12,500 pounds, the Freightliner Unimog is not nearly as nimble as Freightliner's marketing plans for the vehicle. After considerable preparations to sell the four-wheel-drive vehicle to individuals, Freightliner, a division of DaimlerChrysler, is now becoming much more cautious after heavy public criticism. With the Sierra Club labeling the Unimog ''Daimlersaurus Wrecks,'' the company is promoting the Unimog strictly as a commercial truck for fire departments and businesses that need its capacity to carry nearly seven tons of people and cargo.
2001-02-27	Daimler Anticipates A Hard Year, Losing Perhaps $1.5 Billion	With his career and the fate of the world's biggest auto merger hanging in the balance, the chairman and chief executive of DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced his plans for a turnaround today but forecast a grim year ahead. The executive, Jürgen E. Schrempp, warned that Chrysler's American car and truck business would lose $2 billion to $2.5 billion this year and would not break even until some time in 2002.
2001-02-27	Mitsubishi Motors Charts an Austerity Plan of Its Own	The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation outlined a sweeping restructuring plan today that in some ways mirrors that of DaimlerChrysler, which owns about one-third of its stock. Mitsubishi, which has been reeling from sagging car sales as well as recalls and scandals, said it would eliminate 9,500 jobs, or 14 percent of its global work force; close one of its four car plants in Japan; and find ways to reduce spending on parts and supplies by 15 percent. The company's goal is to achieve a gross profit margin of 4.5 percent by 2003.
2001-02-26	An S.U.V. That Makes T. Rex Look Tame	To the Editor: Thank you for warning me of the pending arrival of DaimlerChrysler's enormous Unimog (Business Day, Feb. 21). I will be sure to keep my ear to the ground to know when it is time for me and my bicycle to make a hasty retreat from the streets. It would probably be prudent to vacate the road even if I'm driving my little Honda sport utility; at nearly four times our weight, the Unimog might just be tempted to view us a snack to complement its high-volume diet of diesel. I am sure that I'll be safest off-road anyway, as most Unimog owners won't dare risk spilling their Starbucks lattes on their leather seats.
2001-02-26	Daimler Says It Expects A Big Drop In 2001 Profit	DaimlerChrysler A.G., which has been dragged down by huge losses at Chrysler in the United States, expects its revenue to fall by 13 percent this year and its operating profit to decline by as much as 75 percent, company officials said tonight. The gloomy projections are expected to be announced on Monday, when the company discloses the details of its plan to revamp Chrysler and eliminate 26,000 jobs.
2001-02-24	DaimlerChrysler Weighs Steps to End Losses; Truck Unit Is Focus	Chrysler is not the only problem at DaimlerChrysler A.G. The supervisory board of DaimlerChrysler has reviewed a long list of moves in the hope of restoring profitability, and is now focusing on what to do about the troubled Freightliner trucks and Debis financial services divisions, company officials said today.
2001-02-21	Driving With the Giants	DaimlerChrysler plans to market the Unimog in the United States. The vehicle weighs more than six tons, about the same as a Tyrannosaurus rex. It is twice the weight of, and three feet taller than, even the biggest sport utilities. Base price: $84,000. Bussiness Day, Page C1.
2001-02-21	For the Megagrowth Family, Daimler to Offer a Bigger-Than-S.U.V.	With sport utility vehicles becoming bigger and bigger, perhaps it was inevitable: Freightliner, the nation's biggest maker of 18-wheelers, plans to start selling a four-wheel-drive vehicle that dwarfs even the largest family vehicles on the road. Based on a German military transport, the vehicle, called the Unimog, makes even the Hummer look petite. It is 9 feet 7 inches tall, nearly the height of a basketball net and almost three feet taller than the tallest sport utility. Its front seat, mounted six feet high, is reached by a three-step ladder.
2001-02-18	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring; When Lightning Doesn't Strike Twice	WHEN the Chrysler Corporation introduced its second-generation minivans at the 1995 Detroit auto show, it did so with style, special effects and symbolism. Against a backdrop of a frog pond dotted with lily pads, the new van leaped over the old one. It was an apt image. In those days, Chrysler, the smallest and most nimble of the Big Three, routinely leapfrogged its competitors as it invented new types of vehicles, like the minivan, and then reinvented them in stylish new ways. By mastering and dominating a few parts of the market, Chrysler made more money per vehicle than any other mainstream automaker.
2001-02-11	New for Middle America	
2001-02-08	Cash or Not, Daimler to Pay Its Dividend	DaimlerChrysler A.G., where huge losses at Chrysler have sharply reduced its net cash position, said today that it would nevertheless pay its fairly generous dividend this year at a cost of more than $2 billion. In a brief statement in advance of the release of its financial results, DaimlerChrysler said that losses at its Chrysler unit -- which totaled more than $1.7 billion in the second half of 2000 -- forced the parent company to book a loss of roughly $267 million in the fourth quarter.
2001-02-02	2 Bets, but Just 1 Payoff	ONE vehicle has a ground-breaking design rooted in the past. The other blazed a trail into what its designers saw as the future. Both are vanlike cars (or carlike vans) with a bit of S.U.V. attitude, and both are built in Mexico. Both were gambles, expected to appeal to the young drivers that automakers covet. And now, after months on the market, both are having problems -- of a very different sort. The Chrysler PT Cruiser, with styling reminiscent of Ford hot rods from the 1930's, has been a huge hit. But with strong demand and limited production capacity, PT's are in short supply, and many buyers complain that dealers are still demanding hundreds or thousands of dollars over the sticker price. DaimlerChrysler, eager to take advantage of its single hot product but trying to cope with a wrenching reorganization, must decide whether to spend precious cash to expand the PT Cruiser factory.
2001-02-02	PT's Here And There, But Where?	LAST July, Brian and Lynn McKenna placed an order for a 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser. In December, their dealer, Landmark Chrysler Jeep in Florissant, Mo., called with bad news. The vehicle they wanted would not be built. The McKennas were welcome to order a 2002 model, but the dealership could not guarantee that it would come in either.
2001-01-30	Daimler to Reduce Chrysler Work Force by 20%	The Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced today that it would reduce its work force by 26,000, or 20 percent, over the next three years, mainly by not hiring replacements for retired workers but also by laying off thousands of employees. Dieter Zetsche, the former Mercedes executive sent from headquarters in Germany two months ago to become Chrysler's chief executive and president, said the job cuts were necessary to restore Chrysler to profitability even as the auto market slows with the weakening of the American economy. ''The markets are shrinking, competition is brutal, we are under pressure from imports and an incentive war is on,'' Mr. Zetsche said at Chrysler headquarters here today.
2001-01-24	Shopping Perks Up, Defying Worries of a Slowing Economy	After the slowest holiday shopping season in a decade, Americans seem to have cautiously reopened their wallets in the early weeks of 2001, spending more than either executives or analysts had predicted. General Motors said last week that its January sales were unexpectedly strong, and DaimlerChrysler has canceled plans to shut two plants temporarily this month, citing consumer demand. After falling rapidly in December, mortgage applications for home purchases have bounced back and are again near their record high, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. Spending in restaurants and for compact discs and videos has grown more this month than it did in December, based on Visa USA's tracking of credit card sales.
2001-01-20	The Daimler-Mitsubishi Deal Quickly Comes Under Stress	As Rolf Eckrodt of DaimlerChrysler took his place as chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motors today, Mitsubishi's president wasted no time in raising the one thorn in the relationship between the two companies. After Mitsubishi's directors voted to accept Mr. Eckrodt into his new position, Takashi Sonobe, president of Mitsubishi, vowed that his company would go ahead with a joint venture with Volvo A.B., a deal that will make Mitsubishi and DaimlerChrysler competitors in the market for commercial vehicles in Europe.
2001-01-19	Daimler Seen in Talks for Part of Lernout	DaimlerChrysler A.G. is in early discussions to acquire voice-recognition technology from Lernout & Hauspie, the scandal-plagued Belgian company that is in bankruptcy, executives close to the talks said today. But people close to DaimlerChrysler cautioned that any deal was still far from decided and that the initiative had come from the Belgian company.
2001-01-16	Chrysler Said To Map Plan For Recovery	DaimlerChrysler's strategy for reviving its troubled Chrysler unit will involve eliminating thousands of white-collar jobs, canceling the development of marginally profitable vehicles and sharing auto parts between Chrysler and Mitsubishi, people involved in the automaker's planning said. But the strategy, scheduled for presentation to DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board in Germany on Feb. 23, is likely to call for the closing of few if any factories, nor will it rely on blue-collar layoffs, company executives said in interviews today and over the last week.
2001-01-13	DAIMLERCHRYSLER COMMERCIAL SALES RISE	DaimlerChrysler A.G., the big automaker based in Frankfurt, Germany, said that its sales of commercial vehicles climbed 5 percent last year and that it would consolidate into one entity its units that make components like engines and transmissions. The company also said that it was discussing a new joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Company, in which DaimlerChrysler recently acquired a stake, to produce trucks for the Asian market. Ed Andrews (NYT)
2001-01-13	VOLVO UNHAPPY WITH ALLIANCE	The Swedish motor vehicle manufacturer Volvo A.B. said it was dissatisfied with its alliance with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan and was in talks to modify it. Volvo, which owns 5 percent of Mitsubishi Motors and has agreed to buy 19.9 percent of its truck unit, said it was concerned about the growing role of its chief competitor, DaimlerChrysler, which bought 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors last year and has an option to increase its stake to majority control in 2003. For its part, Mitsubishi Motors has said that it wants to retain its alliance with Volvo, including a medium-size truck they are jointly developing. Volvo won United States regulatory approval last month to acquire the truck division of Renault S.A.
2001-01-09	Chrysler's Troubled Marriage	For all their talk of globalization, corporate executives often cannot overcome their national jealousies and cultural biases when they merge with foreign entities to become truly global players. Daimler-Benz's $36 billion acquisition of Chrysler in 1998 is a distressing case in point. When the merger was first announced, there was more than the customary breathless talk of synergies. The combination would enable Daimler to enter the market for reasonably priced cars and the Chrysler brand to go global. But the usual clash of corporate cultures and egos was magnified in this merger by trans-Atlantic misunderstandings and tension. Many of Chrysler's top American managers and designers, responsible for turning the company into one of the world's most profitable and innovative automakers in the mid-1990's, departed as a result of the acrimony. Speculation among industry analysts this week at Detroit's annual auto show that Toyota could someday overtake Chrysler as the No. 3 auto seller in the United States is indicative of Chrysler's diminished prospects.
2001-01-06	Chrysler Cuts 1st-Quarter Production 26%	The Chrysler division of DaimlerChryslerA.G. said today that it planned to build 26 percent fewer cars and light trucks in the first quarter than a year earlier as American auto sales slow. The automaker, the third largest in the United States, plans to build 678,700 vehicles, down from 916,000, said Jay Cooney, a spokesman.
2001-01-05	The industry closely watches True North's handover of Chrysler to the Omnicom Group.	TRANSITION is very much in the news these days, not only in Washington but on Madison Avenue, too. And there were important developments yesterday in the transition being closely watched by the advertising industry as True North Communications hands over its huge Chrysler Group creative and media assignments to the Omnicom Group. True North, based in Chicago, said it would take a one-time charge of up to $20 million in the fourth quarter and lay off about 150 employees in the wake of the loss of the assignments, with billings estimated at $1.8 billion. The Chrysler Group, part of DaimlerChrysler A.G., decided in early November to consolidate its accounts with Omnicom, dismissing True North units like FCB Worldwide after 21 years.
2001-01-05	CHRYSLER TO END PRODUCTION OF JEEP CHEROKEE	Production of the Jeep Cherokee, the off-road vehicle that ignited the sport utility vehicle craze when it was introduced in 1984, will end this summer, the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced yesterday. A new vehicle of similar size, the Liberty, will replace the Cherokee; Grand Cherokees will remain in production. Chrysler said last year that it would sell the Cherokee and Liberty side by side as long as Cherokees remained popular, but sales of the older vehicle, which has not been substantially updated in 16 years, slid sharply last year. The softening car market in 2001 did not look strong enough to support both models, a company spokesman said. Keith Bradsher (NYT)
2001-01-04	Vehicle Sales Fell Sharply In December	Auto sales slowed precipitously last month, with domestic automakers reporting plunges of up to 18 percent from year-ago levels. Foreign automakers, though, escaped almost unscathed and gained market share. Ward's Automotive, an industry data service, calculated that overall sales fell 7.6 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million cars and light trucks.
2000-12-29	Another 2000 Record: The Most Recalls Yet	CAR buyers want more: more safety technology, more horsepower, more cup holders. What they don't want are more recall notices. But consumers are getting plenty anyway -- a record 21 million vehicles were the subject of safety-related recalls this year. But that may actually be a positive development, since each recall indicates an attempt to fix some sort of safety defect.
2000-12-24	Report Cards for the 2000-01 Term: Grading on the Curves; A Retro Valedictorian	MY list of automotive overachievers is short this year: The Chrysler PT Cruiser was the standout of 2000. The PT was a sensation, and deservedly so: It has a truly distinctive retro style, flexible and practical space for people or cargo, a commendably small size and a very reasonable price -- so long as you don't count the markups that many dealers have charged in the face of high demand and limited supplies.
2000-12-20	GOODYEAR'S NEW-VEHICLE TIRE SALES FELL IN MONTH	The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company said yesterday that shipments of tires for new cars and trucks in North America fell in November, mainly because of production cutbacks at DaimlerChrysler, and because higher costs for energy and raw materials, especially oil and rubber, eroded profits. But November shipments of replacement tires in North America ran ''well above'' the 5 percent growth that the industry as a whole experienced, even though the company raised its prices. One-quarter of Goodyear's worldwide tire sales go to automakers, and the rest to the replacement market, the company said.
2000-12-19	Daimler Says Chrysler's Problems Are Worsening	DaimlerChrysler indicated today that losses at Chrysler, its troubled American car division, would balloon to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. And next year may be worse. The disclosure confirmed widespread suspicions that Chrysler's slide had accelerated sharply the last several weeks, as an abrupt slowdown in the American car market has aggravated Chrysler's home-grown problems. It also raises new questions about the survival prospects of Jurgen E. Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman and architect of the two-year-old merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler.
2000-12-18	DaimlerChrysler at a Juncture	Jurgen E. Schrempp, the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, may be running out of time. Two years after the trans-Atlantic merger of Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation, the Chrysler operations are hemorrhaging money, and DaimlerChrysler shares have lost more than $60 billion in value since January 1999. Mr. Schrempp installed Dieter Zetsche, a Stuttgart executive, as president of Chrysler and told him to come up with a turnaround plan by the time the company announces year-end financial results on Feb. 28. Cost-cutting is the priority, but it may not be enough if the American car market continues to soften. Industry executives say that Daimler's biggest shareholder, Deutsche Bank, may pull the plug on Mr. Schrempp if he cannot bring about some improvement by summer.
2000-12-10	As Chrysler Love Sours, The Chief Takes New Vows	Jurgen E. Schrempp, chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, is struggling to avoid financial disaster in the two-year-old corporate marriage that united Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation. But last Tuesday, Mr. Schrempp stole away and got married himself. In a secret ceremony attended by a handful of relatives, Mr. Schrempp, 56, wed his longtime assistant, Lydia Deininger, who is 36.
2000-12-08	2 Automakers Act on Weakening Sales	General Motors announced a big slowdown in factory production today while Chrysler asked its suppliers to cut their prices by 5 percent on Jan. 1, further signs that Detroit is struggling with an abrupt weakening of auto sales and ballooning inventories of unsold cars. G.M. said that it would produce 14.5 percent fewer vehicles in the next three months than it did in the first quarter of this year. Ford announced last Friday that its output would be down 10 percent in the next three months. And while Chrysler has not yet disclosed its first-quarter production plans, it is also expected to make many fewer cars in January, February and March by eliminating overtime and by not operating some factories at all for a week or two at a time.
2000-12-07	INQUIRY ON DAIMLER RAIL SALE	The European Commission has begun an antitrust investigation of the proposed sale of DaimlerChrysler's Adtranz railroad equipment unit to Bombardier, the Canadian transportation equipment conglomerate. The commission said the deal raised serious competition concerns in the markets for regional trains, trolleys and trams in Germany, Austria, France and Sweden. A final ruling is expected in April. Paul Meller
2000-12-02	Automakers Are Facing a Sales Slowdown	Through most of the 1990's, automakers avoided building new assembly plants, convinced that the good times would not last. They have finally committed themselves in the last two years to a string of new factories, only to find their timing is as poor as ever: sales have begun to slow, particularly for Detroit's manufacturers. The combined sales of Detroit-based automakers fell 3.5 percent last month, compared with November of last year. While sales are still at a level that would have been considered very strong until the last two years, they have now lagged last year's pace in six of the last seven months -- and much more production capacity is becoming available.
2000-12-01	CHRYSLER EXPECTED TO CLOSE MORE PLANTS TEMPORARILY	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. is expected to announce this morning the temporary closing of a series of factories, some for more than a week. As the economy slows, Chrysler has huge inventories of unsold Jeeps and minivans, and the unit's new German management has been reluctant to continue offering costly rebates to increase sales and keep factories operating. DaimlerChrysler plants in Detroit; Brampton, Ontario; and Toledo, Ohio, are already closed this week, affecting about 13,600 workers. Keith Bradsher
2000-11-28	Big Investor Sues DaimlerChrysler, Objecting to '98 Merger Deal	Kirk Kerkorian, the corporate raider who tried to buy Chrysler five years ago, sued DaimlerChrysler A.G. and three of its top officials today, accusing them of having gained control of the American automaker under false pretenses in 1998. He asked a federal court to order Daimler to pay him $8 billion in damages, and possibly to dissolve the merger. Mr. Kerkorian's holding company, the Tracinda Corporation, filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court in Delaware, contending that Daimler and its top officials had presented the deal as a ''merger of equals'' while planning all along to turn Chrysler into little more than an American division of the German multinational.
2000-11-26	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chrysler PT Cruiser; 'Le Jimmy Cagney Car' Makes a Big Bang in France	JUST outside the cathedral at Mont-St.-Michel on the Normandy coast, a school bus pulled up. Elementary school children rushed en masse to the windows, pressed faces to the glass and shouted enthusiastically, ''Le Pe-e-e-e Te-e-e-e! C'est magnifique!'' It wasn't the first time that happened during a family trip through France in a Chrysler PT Cruiser -- nor would it be the last. Attracting curious onlookers was a regular occurrence.
2000-11-26	This 1998 Model Is Looking More Like a Lemon	AS she looked out over the room of more than 400 managers at Chrysler headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., last Monday, Jurgen Schrempp knew that many of them viewed him as the enemy. Still, as the chairman of DaimlerChrysler A.G., and the man who orchestrated Daimler-Benz's takeover of Chrysler two years ago, he was not about to shy away. First, he apologized for recent published remarks in which he had suggested that he had duped Chrysler managers by cloaking the takeover as a ''merger of equals.'' But then he recounted a litany of complaints: that Chrysler executives had stumbled on strategy, missed their own sales forecasts, failed to communicate their problems and shocked him by running huge losses. ''Chrysler had no credible plan for the next year,'' Mr. Schrempp told his listeners, according to participants. ''Chrysler needs a change.''
2000-11-23	2 Automakers Plan to Idle Some North American Plants	DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Ford Motor Company said today that they would idle some North American plants next week as the automakers try to reduce the number of unsold cars and trucks. DaimlerChrysler plants in Detroit; Brampton, Ontario; and Toledo, Ohio, will be closed for the week starting Monday, affecting about 13,600 workers, the company said. Ford is idling its Avon Lake, Ohio, plant, for two weeks starting next week, affecting about 1,600 workers.
2000-11-21	Staff Cuts Expected At BBDO Worldwide	The BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group in New York said yesterday that it would soon make an unspecified number of staff reductions among employees in North America to help achieve the cost savings the agency had promised when it was awarded the consolidated account of the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. ''It is not by any means a deep cut,'' said Allen Rosenshine, chairman and chief executive of BBDO, adding that he wanted to disclose the cuts now because ''it's more demoralizing'' if they leaked out.
2000-11-21	Auto Sales Have Slowed This Month	Auto sales, often a leading indicator of the economy's health, have slowed since the beginning of the month, prompting carmakers to increase their already deep discounts and to consider additional temporary closings of factories, industry officials said today. General Motors and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have already closed some factories for a week at a time and appear likely to announce further temporary closings soon, they said. Ford Motor has avoided closing factories so far, except because of parts shortages, but its officials have been warning that the entire industry is slowing. And even foreign automakers are seeing some weakness in sales and have been offering many discounts.
2000-11-18	Daimler Warns On Earnings; Ousts Executive	DaimlerChrysler A.G., acknowledging that problems at Chrysler are even worse than when it reported a $512 million loss three weeks ago, vowed a major shake-up that began today with the ouster of its American president, James P. Holden. In a brief statement that followed a meeting of the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board in Stuttgart, the company said it would ''fundamentally reposition and restructure'' Chrysler, the third-largest car manufacturer in the United States.
2000-11-17	Partial Sell-Off of Chrysler Reported Under Discussion	DaimlerChrysler's slumping stock price and the increasingly gloomy profit outlook at its Chrysler subsidiary have prompted several board members to begin discussing privately the possibility of selling off at least part of Chrysler, according to executives close to the company. The informal discussions come as Chrysler appears certain to miss its profit target for this year and faces even bigger declines in the year ahead. DaimlerChrysler is expected to announce changes today, including the replacement of Chrysler's American chief executive, James P. Holden, by Dieter Zetsche, head of commercial vehicles for Daimler.
2000-11-15	Daimler Will Soon Replace President of a Struggling Chrysler	Amid growing exasperation over mounting losses at the Chrysler Group, DaimlerChrysler A.G. plans to replace Chrysler's president with a top German executive, company executives said today. An announcement of the resignation of the Chrysler president, James P. Holden, is expected to come on Friday, when DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board will hold a special meeting, executives in the two headquarters in Stuttgart and Auburn Hills., Mich., confirmed. Dieter Zetsche, 47, currently head of Daimler's commercial vehicle business, will replace Mr. Holden.
2000-11-10	LOSSES LOOM AT MITSUBISHI	The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation said it might lose money the next two years as it awaits the benefits of building fewer basic models and other cost-cutting. The company, Japan's No. 4 automaker, said losses in the current fiscal year might triple to at least 70 billion yen ($652 million). DaimlerChrysler paid $1.9 billion in October for a one-third stake in the company. Since then, Mitsubishi has been rocked by a scandal over cover-ups of customer complaints about defects.
2000-11-07	True North weighs options, including layoffs, sale or merger, after losing Chrysler account.	TOP executives of True North Communications in Chicago are outlining a series of aggressive steps to counter the impending departure of their largest client, the Chrysler Group. The executives, in a conference call yesterday with analysts, investors and reporters, said they would rule out nothing as they pursued ways to recoup the loss of the estimated $140 million in annual revenue from the Chrysler Group, the United States operations unit of DaimlerChrysler. The options they described included landing another big automotive client, laying off employees and considering ''strategic possibilities'' like a sale or merger.
2000-11-04	In Blow to True North, Chrysler Shifts Ad Accounts to Omnicom	In one of the largest consolidations ever of advertising assignments by a giant marketer, the Chrysler Group said late yesterday that it had decided to use units of the Omnicom Group in New York to handle its worldwide creative and media accounts, with billings estimated at $1.8 billion. The decision, effective in six months or less, came after a two-month review that pitted Omnicom against True North Communications in Chicago. Both agency companies have for many years divided the assignments to create Chrysler Group corporate and product campaigns as well as buy commercial time and advertising space for those ads.
2000-11-03	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Hybrid Cars Show Up In M.I.T.'s Crystal Ball	THE Massachusetts Institute of Technology and DaimlerChrysler have given their assessments on the future of the automobile, and have both come out in favor of hybrid gasoline-electric cars. But scientists at M.I.T.'s Energy Laboratory, working with computer models, had an easier time predicting costs and benefits of the cars than DaimlerChrysler, working in steel and glass, is likely to have selling them. M.I.T. completed a two-year study last month comparing a gasoline-powered 1996-model sedan with some cars that might be feasible by 2020, including advanced gasoline models; hybrids that combine a gasoline or diesel engine with an electric motor and batteries; cars running on fuel cells with a raw fuel of either natural gas, gasoline or methanol; and electrics running on batteries. The study was a ''well to wheels'' comparison that took into account the energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions at every stage, from making the gasoline or other fuel to burning it in the vehicle. It also looked at the costs to consumers of the various technologies.
2000-11-02	U.S. Auto Sales Sag, Another Slowdown Sign	Not even aggressive discounting by automakers could lift sales of new cars and light trucks last month, and bloated inventories of unsold models have led to the closing for a week of 8 of the nation's 55 auto assembly plants. Auto sales are the first important economic indicator to come out at the beginning of each month, and today's results were another sign that growth in the American economy has been slowing somewhat recently. Although sales have leveled off at a high level by historical standards, they are increasingly being sustained by ever more generous rebates and low-rate loans, rather than by strong consumer demand.
2000-10-27	DaimlerChrysler's Profit Falls 78%, and Relief Is Not in Sight	DaimlerChrysler A.G. said today that its third-quarter profit fell by 78 percent, and its executives said that the bad times might continue well into next year. As expected, the biggest reason for the decline was a loss of $512 million at the Chrysler Group in the United States, its first quarterly loss in nine years. Burdened with older models under intense competitive pressure, Chrysler sold 14 percent fewer cars in the third quarter than in the corresponding period a year earlier and tried, unsuccessfully, to preserve market share by offering billions of dollars in buying incentives.
2000-10-24	DAIMLERCHRYSLER IS SAID TO CUT BACK MODELS	Faced with rising gasoline prices, a slowing market for large sport utilities and intense pressure from its corporate parent in Germany to cut costs, the American operations of DaimlerChrysler have changed plans for future models, said a person familiar with the plans. The former Chrysler operations have canceled plans to build a full-sized Dodge sport utility vehicle and will make fewer costly design changes than previously planned in the next Jeep Grand Cherokee, the person said. The big Dodge vehicle, which would have competed with the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Excursion, has been repeatedly canceled and then revived over the last seven years. Ward's Automotive Reports reported the Dodge plans over the weekend, while Reuters reported yesterday that the next Grand Cherokee would not be heavily redesigned. Keith Bradsher
2000-10-20	WORLD BUSINESS: German Giants to Clash in Britain; Volkswagen and BMW to Vie for Sales to the Very Wealthy	The red-brick car assembly plant in the unassuming suburbs of this town in northwest England seems an unlikely front line in a looming clash of titans in the German auto industry. But since Volkswagen bought Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motor Cars of Britain two years ago, the Rolls-Royce factory here, built in the 1930's, has been propelled to the center of a scramble among German carmakers for the wallets of the newly very rich.
2000-10-19	Jacoby & Springer In Expanded Role	DaimlerChrysler A.G., has again expanded its relationship with Jacoby & Springer in Hamburg, Germany, by naming the agency to handle creative duties for two Mercedes-Benz car models, the C-Class Sportcoupe and the C-Class T-Model, which are to be introduced next year in several crucial markets worldwide. Billings were estimated at more than $30 million. J. Justus Schneider, vice president for marketing communications worldwide at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany, said the decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Jacoby & Springer and four other agencies Mercedes works with: Batey Ads in Singapore, part of the Batey Group, an associate investment of the WPP Group; Devarrieux Villaret in Paris, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising; Partners BDDH in London, also part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas; and Clemenger BBDO in Melbourne, Australia, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
2000-10-11	S & P LOWERS OUTLOOK ON DAIMLERCHRYSLER	The Standard & Poor's Corporation revised its outlook on DaimlerChrysler A.G. to negative from stable yesterday. The negative outlook reflects the risk that the poor profitability of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division will not prove temporary, S.& P. said. Management has said Chrysler, which had accounted for about half of the group's earnings since the merger in late 1998, is expected to record an operating loss of $520 million in the third quarter, largely reflecting temporary problems with its new minivan, S.& P. said. But competition in minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickups is also a problem, despite record demand in North America, S.& P. said. If earnings do not improve, the ratings could be cut, S.& P. said.
2000-10-11	When One Model Lifts a Line	THE first Thunderbird was inspired by a visit to the 1951 Paris auto show by Lewis Crusoe, a Ford Motor Company executive, and the designer George Walker. Time magazine once called Mr. Walker ''the Cellini of chrome.'' At Ford, he created a clean and classic European sports car, a low-slung two-seater that combined a Ferrari-style grille with tail fins and rocket-thruster taillights. The Thunderbird could hardly have looked more different from the bulbous, bourgeois postwar sedans that people associated with Ford.
2000-10-10	Carmaker Consolidating E-Commerce	DaimlerChrysler A.G. said today that it would spend $500 million to consolidate all its electronic-commerce activities in a single venture, DCX Net Holdings. The new company will oversee all of the DaimlerChrysler business-to-business, business-to-customer, business-to-employee and telematics activities. Telematics involves the use of computer and telecommunications technology to create intelligent transportation management systems.
2000-10-04	G.M.'s Sales Are Off, but Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Are Up	General Motors' United States auto sales fell last month as overseas rivals had gains and DaimlerChrysler offered deep discounts to move an aging minivan line. Ford Motor's sales rose on increases for the Explorer sport utility vehicle and other light trucks.
2000-09-28	Parent Says Chrysler Unit Will Post a Third-Quarter Loss	DaimlerChrysler A.G. said today that its Chrysler car group would report a loss in the third quarter -- the first such loss since a recession in the United States nine years ago -- and that Chrysler's highly respected design chief, Thomas C. Gale, would retire at the end of this year. Though neither announcement had been entirely unexpected, they provided new evidence that DaimlerChrysler remains deeply divided between its American and German car companies long after their merger.
2000-09-28	Mexican Truck Maker May Lose Order	Consorcio G Grupo Dina S.A., a troubled Mexican bus and truck maker, faces the loss of a three-year agreement to make 9,000 trucks for Western Star Truck Holdings now that Western Star has been bought by DaimlerChrysler A.G. DaimlerChrysler, through its United States truck unit, Freightliner, will cancel Dina's agreement with Western Star in 60 days, Debi Nicholson, a Freightliner spokeswoman, said. The company completed the purchase of Western Star on Tuesday for $453 million, she said. The agreement that is to be canceled allowed Western Star to buy trucks from Dina as it needed them.
2000-09-21	HYUNDAI LEAVING DAEWOO ALONE	The Hyundai Motor Company said it had no plans to make a solo bid to acquire the Daewoo Motor Company, even though regulators might seek one. Its partner in the first round of bidding, DaimlerChrysler, said it might be interested in part of Daewoo. The chairman of Hyundai Motor, Chung Mong Koo, said he had never considered making a bid without participation by DaimlerChrysler because the company already had overlapping product models with Daewoo.
2000-09-12	U.S. Approves Formation of Supply Web Site for Automakers	Federal antitrust regulators approved today the establishment of an online venture that would allow five major automakers -- including the top three in America -- to buy supplies through a single Internet portal. The Federal Trade Commission approved the formation of Covisint, the business-to-business Web site, which proponents said would streamline the annual purchase of as much as $300 billion in parts for the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler A.G.
2000-09-09	DaimlerChrysler Tightens Reins On Management Of Mitsubishi	DaimlerChrysler moved today to tighten control over the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Japan's fourth-largest automaker, which has been reeling from last month's disclosure that it had concealed customer complaints about auto defects for more than two decades. The president of Mitsubishi Motors, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, will resign on Nov. 1. Takashi Sonobe, currently the executive vice president, will replace him. Rolf Eckrodt, the chief executive of Adtranz, DaimlerChrysler's train-making subsidiary, is coming to Mitsubishi Motors as its new chief operating officer.
2000-09-08	Giants Engage in Battle for Billings as DaimlerChrysler Conducts Assignment Review	The battle lines are already being drawn in one of the biggest confrontations in Madison Avenue history. Two giant agency companies -- the Omnicom Group and True North Communications -- are squaring off in a huge review unexpectedly called by a major client they share, the DaimlerChrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler A. G. The company is undertaking a review for assignments with spending estimated at $1.3 billion, out of a total spent last year of $1.5 billion. The work is now divided between the Southfield, Mich., offices of BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom, and FCB Worldwide, part of True North.
2000-09-07	Daimler to Review Chrysler Accounts	The DaimlerChrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. -- known as the Chrysler Corporation before being acquired by Daimler-Benz -- said unexpectedly last night that it would begin a review on accounts with billings estimated at $1.2 billion. The assignments, now divided between two agencies, may be consolidated at a single shop. The accounts under review are national and regional dealer creative assignments for the Dodge brand, handled by BBDO Detroit in Southfield, Mich., part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, and three assignments handled by the Southfield office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications: the worldwide Chrysler and Jeep brand accounts and the worldwide corporate brand account for the DaimlerChrysler Group.
2000-09-07	DAIMLERCHRYSLER HYUNDAI STAKE	DaimlerChrysler A.G. has been given approval by the Hyundai Motor Company of Korea to buy a 9 percent stake in the company, giving the German company a place in Asia's truck market. DaimlerChrysler will pay 430.9 billion won ($389 million), or 20,900 won a share, for the stake and will set terms to buy an additional 0.99 percent soon, Hyundai Motor said. The price is a 25 percent premium to Hyundai Motor's closing price of 16,700 won.
2000-09-05	Daimler Seeks More Control Of Mitsubishi	DaimlerChrysler, which has based its hopes for Asian expansion on a partnership with Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, is demanding more control in the wake of a scandal over defective cars that has engulfed Mitsubishi. In a brief statement today, a spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart confirmed that ''we are in talks about the future of the alliance'' in the context of ''the current challenges facing Mitsubishi Motor Company.''
2000-08-29	DAIMLERCHRYSLER EXTENDS DETROIT DIESEL TENDER OFFER	DaimlerChrysler, the world's largest commercial truck maker, said yesterday that it had extended a tender offer for its planned $583 million purchase of the Detroit Diesel Corporation, a maker of diesel engines, to Sept. 11. The $23-a-share offer initially was scheduled to end at midnight last Friday. The automaker said on July 20 that it would buy about 18.1 million shares of Detroit Diesel that it did not already own for $423 million and assume about $160 million in debt. About 98 percent of those shares have been tendered, DaimlerChrysler said in a regulatory filing. It already owned about 21 percent of Detroit Diesel, a former General Motors division that was sold to the former race-car driver Roger Penske in 1988.
2000-08-28	DaimlerChrysler to Expand Its Production in Alabama	DaimlerChrysler plans to announce on Monday that it will nearly double production in Alabama, adding another assembly line close to the site where it already builds M-Class sport utility vehicles, auto industry officials and consultants said over the weekend. The Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the nearest large city to its sport utility vehicle factory in Vance. The planned construction project is the latest sign that Alabama's auto industry is growing. Honda has just begun building a minivan factory near Vance, too.
2000-08-15	DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO LAY OFF 3,745 AT TRUCK UNIT	DaimlerChrysler's Freightliner unit said yesterday that it would lay off 3,745 United States and Canadian workers, or 19 percent of the total, as the truckmaker cuts production because of slower North American truck demand. Freightliner said the layoffs would be at plants in Portland, Ore., 770 workers; Cleveland, N.C., 1,304; Mount Holly, N.C., 825; Gastonia, N.C., 154; and St. Thomas, Ontario, 692. The United States cuts will start on Oct. 20 and the Canadian layoffs on Dec. 4. Freightliner expects North American heavy-truck sales to fall as much as 25 percent this year from 1999.
2000-08-07	Corrections	An article by Reuters in Business Day on July 27 about the second-quarter earnings of DaimlerChrysler misstated the company's plan to cut costs. The company is considering the elimination of some -- not all -- of its administrative jobs, which total 5,000 to 6,000 worldwide.
2000-08-06	At the G.O.P. Convention, Carmakers Toot Horns ...	It was the battle of the cars at the Republican National Convention, between G.M. and DaimlerChrysler. On Sunday night, G.M., which gave $1 million to the convention's host committee, held a party for 2,000 people. It featured Hank Williams Jr. and a replica of the Batmobile. DaimlerChrysler, which had given the host committee $250,000, held a reception honoring Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma that featured the Temptations and a gold Phaeton, a futuristic concept car.
2000-08-04	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Safety; Poor Crash Results for 2 Popular Cars	TWO of the nation's most popular new vehicles, the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Ford Focus ZX3, have fared badly in government crash tests. The PT Cruiser received what amounts to a poor rating -- two stars of a possible five -- for its ability to protect the head of a driver wearing a safety belt in a front collision, according to results released recently by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The two-door Focus ZX3 got just one star -- the lowest possible rating -- for protecting a rear passenger in a side crash.
2000-08-01	DAIMLERCHRYSLER STARTS OFFER FOR DETROIT DIESEL	DaimlerChrysler began its tender offer yesterday for a planned $583 million purchase of the Detroit Diesel Corporation, a diesel-engine maker. The $23-a-share offer expires Aug. 25, unless extended, DaimlerChrysler said. On July 20, the automaker said it would buy the roughly 18.1 million shares of Detroit Diesel that it did not already own for $423 million and assume about $160 million in debt. Detroit Diesel, a former General Motors division, was sold to Roger Penske, the former race-car driver, in 1988. DDC Holdings, a unit of the closely held Penske Corporation that owns 48.6 percent of Detroit Diesel's outstanding shares, agreed to tender all of them, Detroit Diesel said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
2000-07-23	It's Whatever You Make of It	Austin Lavin letter says he and his high school friends consider PT Cruiser cool2
2000-07-23	It's Whatever You Make of It	Not since the 1998 New Beetle, or possibly the '65 Mustang, has a car captivated the public like the PT Cruiser. Here are three other views of the car and the phenomenon: Another Blast From the Past Bad times produce good design. After Chrysler's near-death experience in the 80's, its collective brain turned out the useful minivan, the cab-forward sedan, the mucho-macho Ram truck. The creative juices of a design team headed by Tom Gale and John Herlitz jelled into jaw-dropping shapes like the Atlantic show car, the Viper supercar, the Prowler street rod and the PT Cruiser (attributed to Bryan Nesbitt, 31). But fine design cannot exist in a vacuum, and one secret of Chrysler's success was a management that encouraged risk-taking. In particular, Robert A. Lutz, who rose to vice chairman, went to bat for proposals he liked, staving off the committee-think that often dulls sharp ideas.
2000-07-20	GERMAN-CANADIAN TRUCK DEAL	The German auto giant DaimlerChrysler A.G. agreed to buy Western Star Trucks Holdings of Kelowna, British Columbia, for 670 million Canadian dollars ($456 million) and merge it into its Freightliner truck division. Western Star, which makes heavy trucks in Kelowna and transit buses in Mississauga, Ontario, and Oriskany, N.Y., had sales last year of $885 million, less than one-tenth of those of Freightliner. Timothy Pritchard
2000-07-17	Corrections	An article last Monday about DaimlerChrysler's plan to rent space in the Chrysler Building misspelled the given name of the company's chairman. He is Jurgen E. Schrempp, not Juergens.
2000-07-16	Is It Bold and New, Or Just Tried and True?; Chrysler Plays It Safe in Minivan Redesign	SINCE the early 1980's, Chrysler has cultivated a reputation for daring, innovative designs, beating bigger rivals by creating the minivan market and by revitalizing the full-size pickup truck market with the burly Dodge Ram. Just this year, its new PT Cruiser, an eccentric combination of a 1930's gangster car and a minivan, has been such a hot seller that dealers across the country have months-long waiting lists. So four years ago, when Chrysler formed a team to start designing the next generation of minivans for introduction late this summer, the pressure was fierce to come up with another big step forward. After all, Chrysler invented the traditional minivan in 1983, producing a vehicle that Ford Motor and General Motors had studied for years but never had the courage to build. Chrysler has dominated the minivan market ever since with breakthroughs like the introduction of driver's-side sliding doors in 1995.
2000-07-10	Chrysler May Be in Chrysler Building's Future	The Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan was an icon to the automobile age when it opened in 1930, with stylized hubcaps and racing cars on setbacks, hood-ornament gargoyles and, over parabolas that suggested the spokes of wheels, a stainless steel spire thrusting skyward like profits. Seventy years later, in an age of multinational corporations and virtual reality, Walter B. Chrysler's glorious 77-story Art Deco tower may again become a powerful symbol for a new generation of automakers whose fortunes are as dependent upon images and Wall Street as engines and the open road.
2000-07-04	Big U.S. Automakers' Sales Dropped 1.4% Last Month	Americans bought fewer autos from General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler than expected in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they own. Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8 percent.
2000-06-29	FORD SAID TO LEAD IN DAEWOO BID	South Korean news reports said Ford Motor had won exclusive negotiating rights to buy the heavily indebted Daewoo Motor from a committee of creditors, beating out rival bids from an alliance between DaimlerChrysler and Hyundai Motor and an alliance between General Motors and Fiat. The Korea Economic Daily said the Ford and Daimler-Hyundai bids were each about $6 billion and the G.M.-Fiat bid was lower. G.M. said its alliance was still bidding. None of the other companies or the creditors would comment on the reports. Samuel Len
2000-06-29	HYUNDAI BACKS AWAY FROM BREAKUP PLAN	Emboldened by its new partnership with DaimlerChrysler to capture 97 percent of South Korea's car market, the Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, backed away from plans to split off its flagship car-making subsidiary. Following concerns of a cash shortage last month, Hyundai had been under increased government pressure to shed its vast lineup of subsidiaries. Earlier this week, Chung Ju Yung, the founder of the Hyundai Group, increased his stake in the automaker to 9.1 percent from 6.9 percent. The increased stake by the former honorary chairman of Hyundai has raised concerns that he will continue to exercise significant power over the company. Samuel Len
2000-06-27	BIDDING FOR DAEWOO	Two leading automakers have formed separate alliances in the international bidding for South Korea's ailing Daewoo Motor. DaimlerChrysler announced a $428 million deal to buy 10 percent of Daewoo's larger domestic competitor, Hyundai Motor, and they submitted a joint bid for Daewoo. General Motors and Fiat announced they also would join forces. Creditors of Daewoo, which carries $18 billion in debt, intend to select a winning bidder by the end of September. The foreign bidders also include Ford Motor. Samuel Len (NYT)
2000-06-16	Efficiency on Wheels; U.S. Auto Industry Is Catching Up With the Japanese	The Ford Taurus factory in Atlanta has no air-conditioning to ward off the sweltering heat of the Georgia summer. Its scuffed concrete floors and sooty ceiling beams hold the grit of 53 years of car-building. On the assembly line, orange robots weld car roofs and sides and, farther down, hundreds of men and women install the cars' interiors. To all appearances, it is an utterly ordinary car factory. Yet the Atlanta plant is, in fact, special. According to a highly regarded annual study released yesterday, it was the most efficient in North America last year, representing the first time that an American-owned auto plant has surpassed Japanese-owned factories on this continent in labor productivity.
2000-06-09	Big Carmakers Extend Benefits To Gay Couples	General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division announced today that they would begin offering medical, dental and prescription drug benefits for same-sex partners of their 466,000 hourly and salaried employees in the United States, the largest move yet by corporate America to provide such benefits for gay and lesbian couples. Many companies in the financial, media, entertainment and airline industries and some state and local governments have offered same-sex benefits in the last several years. But gay and lesbian advocates said the automakers' decisions dwarfed previous corporate moves and were particularly welcome because Midwestern companies have been slow to provide such benefits.
2000-06-09	POSSIBLE JOINT BID FOR DAEWOO	South Korea's largest carmaker, the Hyundai Motor Company, said it had been negotiating with DaimlerChrysler A.G. about making a joint bid for the ailing Daewoo Motor Company. For weeks, rumors have been circulating about a joint bid, which could reduce the South Korean government's distaste at the prospect that the nation's largest carmaker will swallow its only rival. ''They are looking positively into the matter,'' said Chung Mong Koo, chairman of Hyundai Motor, referring to DaimlerChrysler. General Motors, Ford and Fiat of Italy have also submitted letters of interest to buy Daewoo Motor. Samuel Len
2000-06-05	U.S. Vehicle Sales in May	Vehicle sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. DaimlerChrysler and General Motors accounted for the entire decline, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun.
2000-06-02	With Loophole, Carmakers Post Mileage Gain	A soon-to-be- released government report shows a slight increase in the fuel economy of family vehicles in the 2000 model year. But the rise is mostly thanks to a loophole that gives carmakers extra mileage credit for vehicles that can run on ethanol, even though virtually no one uses that fuel. Ethanol is sold by only 108 of the nation's 178,000 service stations. Nonetheless, General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are producing roughly 750,000 dual-fuel minivans, small pickup trucks and cars this year at an extra cost of up to $300 each. These vehicles are counted by the government as getting roughly triple the gas mileage that they actually achieve, allowing manufacturers to sell more full-sized sport utilities and pickups while still meeting federal standards for average fuel economy.
2000-06-02	Auto Sales Declined 2% Last Month	Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun. Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American economy might be slowing.
2000-06-01	DaimlerChrysler Curtails Low-Rate Loans	Feeling the effects of rising interest rates, DaimlerChrysler announced today that it would eliminate most low-rate loans on new Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth automobiles on Thursday and instead offer bigger cash rebates to consumers and new discounts to dealers. For most models, DaimlerChrysler currently offers customers a choice of a cash rebate or a loan at a subsidized rate of 1.9 percent to 6.9 percent. The company plans, however, to stop offering low-rate loans nationally, although it will still offer them in some highly competitive markets, notably in the Northeast.
2000-05-24	WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AMERICAS; DAIMLERCHRYSLER IN MEXICO	DaimlerChrysler will invest about $2 billion in Mexico the next five years; Miles Bryant, president of company's Mexico operations, says it is attracted by country's free-trade agreements with Europe and other Latin American countries, which will help protect company against any slowdown in US market (S)
2000-05-07	In a Search for Hot Wheels, Buyers Hit a Dead End	AS Robert Forester watched his dealer pull up in a black Chrysler PT Cruiser to take him for a test drive, he decided on the spot that the retro-looking small van would join his family's fleet. ''I got in that PT Cruiser and fell in love,'' said Mr. Forester, who works for a printing and stationery business in Henderson, Tex., 150 miles east of Dallas.
2000-05-03	Auto Sales Keep to Torrid Pace Even as Loan Costs Rise	Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American economy by now, especially the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet the stampede into the showrooms continues across the country, with every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing today that sales last month exceeded even last year's brisk pace. The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge, indigo blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. Interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he wrote a check for the entire cost of the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the proceeds from stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by the high price of gasoline.
2000-04-20	Daimler Revenue Rises 17%, but Profit Is Up Only Slightly	DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported today that sales climbed 17 percent in the last three months, but it paid for that increase in the form of lower profit margins on both Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz automobiles. The results indicate that Daimler has yet to overcome the problem that has bedeviled it since it was formed last year through the acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz.
2000-04-04	Robust Sales Push U.S. Auto Industry to Its Best Quarter Ever	Americans bought new cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles at a sizzling pace last month, closing out the best quarter ever for the auto industry as the nation's economy appeared to be following up a winter of brisk economic growth with a springtime of continued strong expansion. Ford Motor said today that its sales in the United States leaped 7.2 percent from a year earlier to the highest level ever for a single month. Four other big automakers had their best March ever: DaimlerChrysler, up 4.4 percent from last year; Toyota, up 16 percent; Honda, up 20.3 percent; and Mitsubishi, up 25.4 percent.
2000-04-04	As Crimes Rise In China, Four Germans Are Killed	A German family of four was stabbed to death on Sunday in Nanjing, a rare incident of violence against foreigners that underscores a creeping increase in crime in China. The father, the deputy general manager of a DaimlerChrysler joint venture to make buses, Jurgen Pfrang, found four intruders in his house shortly after midnight on Sunday, Chinese and German officials said. Mr. Pfrang, 51, was reportedly stabbed in a struggle with the men, who killed his wife, 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son.
2000-03-28	GERMAN COMPUTER SERVICE DEAL	Europe's biggest phone company, Deutsche Telekom, bought 50.1 percent of DaimlerChrysler's Debis Systemhaus software business for 5.5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) to expand its computer services business. Deutsche Telekom will take over management of Systemhaus, which is about a quarter of the Debis unit, and expects to save 150 million to 200 million euros over five years by combining the business with its own. The deal ''will make Deutsche Telekom the second- biggest player in Europe behind I.B.M.'' in information technology, said Ron Sommer, the company's chief executive.
2000-03-28	DaimlerChrysler Buying a Third of Mitsubishi for $2.1 Billion	DaimlerChrysler A.G., the world's third-largest maker of motor vehicles, signed an agreement today to invest in the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, finally securing the toehold in Asia it had long wanted. The $2.1 billion deal would leave Toyota and Honda as Japan's last major automakers without big foreign partners.
2000-03-26	DaimlerChrysler Nears Deal To Buy 33.4% of Mitsubishi	In another big move toward the global consolidation of the automobile industry, DaimlerChrysler of Germany is to announce a deal tomorrow to acquire 33.4 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors for about $1.3 billion, people close to the companies said yesterday. The deal would make DaimlerChrysler the world's third-largest automaker, behind General Motors and Ford. All three will now have large shares of the three main markets: Western Europe, Japan and the United States. The other giants of the auto industry, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and the Renault-Nissan alliance, still are weak in at least one of these markets.
2000-03-23	Gentlemen, Merge Your Manufacturers; Consolidation Hits on Virtually All Cylinders	The consolidation of the global auto industry has reached a full-throttle roar as automakers around the world respond to the changing economics of the business. The list of companies partly or entirely acquired by other manufacturers in the last two years was impressive even before the frenzy of the last two weeks: Chrysler, Volvo Cars, Nissan, Saab, Fuji Heavy Industries, Suzuki, Daihatsu, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Since the beginning of last week, General Motors has agreed to buy a fifth of Fiat; Ford Motor has agreed to buy Land Rover from BMW; and DaimlerChrysler has moved close to taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Daewoo and Samsung are both up for sale in Korea, with deals likely later this year.
2000-03-22	DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi Talks Advance	DaimlerChrysler A.G. is in the final stage of talks with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation about acquiring 33.4 percent of the Japanese automobile maker, and an announcement could come by the end of this week, executives close to the talks said last night. While it remains unclear how much DaimlerChrysler would pay for Mitsubishi, based on the company's market capitalization, the deal would be worth about $1.7 billion.
2000-03-21	Carmakers to Alter S.U.V.'s to Reduce Risk to Other Autos	Acknowledging for the first time that sport utility vehicles pose special dangers to other motorists in crashes, automakers say that they are modifying the designs of these vehicles to make them less hazardous. General Motors says it will make the 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada, GMC Envoy and Chevrolet Blazer with steel rails up to 2 inches lower inside their underbodies than in current versions, to reduce the risk of their overriding cars' bumpers and doorsills. Ford Motor plans to do the same for its Explorer, Expedition and Lincoln Navigator over the next two model years.
2000-03-13	Fiat Weighs Sale to G.M. Of a Stake In Auto Line	Fiat is close to selling a minority stake in its car operations to General Motors after apparently failing to sell the entire division to DaimlerChrysler, auto industry officials and executives close to the talks said today. Fiat's board is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the proposed transaction with G.M. and is fairly likely to approve a deal, industry and other executives said today after insisting on anonymity.
2000-03-08	AUTO DEAL RUMORED	Japanese newspapers reported that DaimlerChrysler A. G., the German automaker, was considering buying a 20 to 30 percent stake in the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Japan's fourth-largest car company. DaimlerChrysler, which negotiated to buy a stake in the Nissan Motor Company before walking away early last year, has been behind other carmakers like General Motors and Renault in securing a manufacturing and distribution toehold in Asia.

2000-03-02	Auto Sales in February Near Monthly Record	The United States auto industry is poised to have its second-best month for sales ever after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported higher vehicle sales for February today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining companies report sales on Thursday. That would put February sales in second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million vehicles.
2000-02-29	DaimlerChrysler Reports 16% Rise in 1999 Profit	DaimlerChrysler said today that its profit for 1999 increased 16 percent, in line with analysts' expectations, as it benefited from cost cuts, stronger vehicle sales and a rich mix of high-profit models. DaimlerChrysler, which posted its results in euros and dollars, said its adjusted net income for 1999, its first full year of operation, increased 16 percent, to 6.2 billion euros, or $6.3 billion, compared with $5.4 billion in 1998. That translated to 6.21 euros, or $6.25, a share, compared with $5.62 a share in 1998. Adjusted operating profit increased 20 percent, to 10.32 billion euros, or $10.4 billion. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $151 billion. The results reflect the one-time effects of the sale of its stake in Debitel communication services and the reorganization of its Adtranz rail unit.
2000-02-26	CARMAKERS TO BUY PARTS ON INTERNET	General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler announced today that they would set up the world's biggest online marketplace for the auto industry's private use, a giant auction site like eBay through which they plan to buy the nearly $250 billion worth of parts and other goods they need each year. The site would dwarf all previous commercial activity on the Web. The automakers said they hoped to cut costs and save time by streamlining their purchasing operations and putting them online. The new system would also help them build more cars to customer specifications by allowing them to order parts for assembly plants far more quickly.
2000-02-17	The Gossip of Europe: Talk About Mergers Surrounds Automakers	Europe's automobile industry has gone into overdrive on merger speculation. Today, shares of PSA Peugeot Citroen again rose on rumors that the French automaker was in talks with DaimlerChrysler. The rumors followed persistent speculation about Daimler's seeking to acquire the automobile business of Fiat.
2000-02-15	EUROPEAN DEFENSE INTEGRATION	The three companies that are trying to form the European Aeronautics Defense and Space Company moved a step closer toward achieving their goal by announcing the lineup of top management and the distribution of labor between the German, French and Spanish participants. The new company, built from the aerospace divisions of DaimlerChrysler A.G. in Germany, Aerospatiale Matra S.A. of France and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain, named a carefully balanced roster of 25 French executives, 23 Germans and 4 Spaniards. As previously announced, the co-chief executives will be Philippe Camus of Aerospatiale and Rainer Hertrich of DaimlerChrysler. Edmund L. Andrews
2000-02-02	Newest and Trendiest Autos Bring Americans to Dealers	Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles available, automakers said today, as every manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced big gains in sales. The three increases of a quarter percentage point each in short-term interest rates last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on the torrid pace in the auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that the industry this year would nearly match the record-setting pace of 1999.
2000-02-02	DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO EQUIP VEHICLES WITH SATELLITE RADIO	DaimlerChrysler A.G. will invest $100 million in Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. and install its receivers in its cars and trucks, giving customers access to uninterrupted radio across the United States. The company said it would install Sirius receivers in its vehicles sold in the United States, including those sold under the Mercedes-Benz, Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands, as well as in Freightliner and Sterling heavy trucks. Sirius's digital satellite-radio system will provide coast-to-coast coverage with up to 50 channels of commercial-free music and another 50 channels of news, sports and entertainment for a $9.95 monthly fee. Sirius, formerly named CD Radio, expects to begin broadcasting nationally by the end of the year. Shares of New York-based Sirius rose $3.625 each, to $45, in Nasdaq trading.
2000-01-30	His Eyes Are on the Prize	Now that Robert J. Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's spunky co-chairman, has announced his retirement, the new sign on his door could just as well be: Gone Fishin'. Mr. Eaton has a house on Walloon Lake in northern Michigan, where Ernest Hemingway also had a house, which he prized for the nearby fishing. ''Most of the time I'm going to spend hunting and fishing,'' along with golfing and skiing, Mr. Eaton said last week.
2000-01-28	New Chief at Account For DaimlerChrysler	BBDO Worldwide, a unit of the Omnicom Group, said yesterday that it would make changes in the top management of its Pentamark office in Troy, Mich., which oversees the DaimlerChrysler account. Martin R. Levine, 52, is leaving DaimlerChrysler in Auburn Hills, Mich., where he was vice president at the Chrysler Jeep global brand center, to join Pentamark as president and chief executive, effective on May 1. He will succeed J. Thomas Clark, 63, who will continue as vice chairman at BBDO Worldwide until retiring at the end of 2001.
2000-01-27	Eaton to Retire From DaimlerChrysler	Saying he was leaving because his corporate goals had been reached, Robert J. Eaton, the former chairman of Chrysler, announced today that he would retire, effective March 31, as co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler, the merged global automaker he helped to form. ''The two companies are one; my goal has been accomplished,'' he said in a statement. ''This is the right time for me to go.''
2000-01-01	Detroit Plays Catch-Up In Race for Hybrid Car; With Fewer Subsidies, Japan Is Ahead	With hundreds of millions of dollars of private and federal research work behind it, the General Motors Precept, an experimental model to be introduced here on Jan. 9, is probably the most expensive single car ever built. Yet it is still a lot of car for the money. In place of side-view mirrors, which cause a lot of wind resistance, it has tiny cameras, mounted on the front doors, that send images to the dashboard. Rather than the smooth, rounded contours commonly associated with aerodynamic design, carefully angled body panels are designed to give the six-passenger Precept far less wind resistance than a Corvette sports car. And instead of a gasoline engine, the car has two electric motors, batteries under the seats and a rear diesel engine to charge the batteries and provide additional power and range.
2000-01-01	A New Meaning For Automatic	HANS-GEORG METZLER envisions the day when he has conversations with his car. It will tell him about traffic jams and predict where new ones probably will develop. It will watch for jaywalkers and warn him if he seems not to have noticed a stop sign ahead. It will listen for unusual engine noises, run diagnostic tests and report any problems. And if he gets caught in slow-moving highway traffic, his car can take over the controls, keeping a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead.
1999-12-29	Despite Woes, An Automaker Posts a Profit	After a stormy first year one that included management turmoil, a strategy change and employee culture shock -- DaimlerChrysler said today that preliminary figures show 1999 revenue increased 12.3 percent and operating profits rose even more. DaimlerChrysler, which was formed on Nov. 12, 1998 when Germany's staid Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler, said today that its 1999 revenue would probably reach $148 billion euros, or $149 billion, up 12.3 percent from the 131.8 billion euros, or $154.6 billion, the two companies earned in 1998. For 1998, the revenue figures were calculated using the Dec. 31, 1998, exchange rate of 1.1733 dollars a euro, while the 1999 figures reflect the euro's fall to roughly 1.01 to the dollar.
1999-12-03	Cars Overtake Light Trucks In November Sales Figures	A surprising jump in car sales allowed Ford Motor to post an unexpectedly strong November, as the industry's sales of cars increased faster than those of high-profit sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans for the first time in nearly three years. Excluding Volvo Cars, which Ford bought last March, Ford's sales rose 4.9 percent last month from a year earlier. That allowed Ford to almost keep pace with the industry, which grew 7.1 percent, as Asian and European automakers prospered while General Motors's sales were flat and DaimlerChrysler's sales edged down.
1999-12-02	G.M. and DaimlerChrysler Report Weak Monthly Sales	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler announced November sales figures today that were weaker than expected as American automakers continued to lose market share to Japanese rivals, who posted big gains. G.M. said its sales in the United States inched up just one-tenth of a percent last month compared with figures in the period a year earlier, several percentage points worse than expected, while DaimlerChrysler said its sales fell 1.3 percent last month, marginally worse than expected. But Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and particularly Nissan Motor all reported large increases, while sales for Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled.
1999-11-13	TRAINMAKER CUTS JOBS	Europe's biggest industrial company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., will cut 16 percent of the work force at its Adtranz unit, halving production capacity, in yet another effort to turn around the unit, which is the world's biggest train maker. The company will take a charge of 190 million euros ($197 million) against earnings this year to carry out the plan, the third in three years. The latest is aimed at saving 300 million euros a year by closing six manufacturing sites in Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Portugal and the United States. Adtranz, which has lost money every year since 1996, will eliminate 3,000 jobs: 1,000 in production, 1,400 in administration and 600 in engineering.
1999-11-05	Plymouth Becomes a Ghost Ship	PLYMOUTH is about to sail into the sunset. DaimlerChrysler announced on Wednesday that it would phase out the brand at the end of the 2001 model year. Plymouth began in 1928, named for the Pilgrim colony in Massachusetts. The car was the brainchild of Walter P. Chrysler, who wanted to round out his offerings with a low-priced model.
1999-11-03	Foreign Nameplate Autos Are Sales Favorites in U.S.	Buyers snapped up cars and trucks with foreign nameplates last month, forsaking some of their past favorites -- American-made sport utility vehicles. Nearly every foreign brand reporting sales results today showed increases, and many notched double-digit gains. Toyota sales rose 12.6 percent in October compared to the same period a year ago. Honda sales rose 3.2 percent and Nissan jumped 27.6 percent.
1999-11-02	Some Jeep Wranglers to Get New Plastic Roofs	Taking a big step forward in the development of automobiles with plastic bodies, DaimlerChrysler announced today that it would equip 5,000 of its Jeep Wranglers each year with lightweight, low-cost roofs made from a new kind of specially hardened plastic, starting in the 2001 model year. A different kind of plastic, made by taking sheets of plastic and pressing them into shapes in big machines, is already used to produce current Wrangler roofs and to make many exterior body panels of Saturn cars. The new plastic, made by injecting liquid material directly into giant molds, can make stronger, cheaper and less brittle auto parts that could replace steel for structural auto body parts within 10 years, DaimlerChrysler officials and outside experts said today.
1999-10-30	DaimlerChrysler Shifts U. S. Managers to Increase Local Control	The American unit of DaimlerChrysler announced a sweeping reorganization of its senior executive ranks today, a move that the company said was intended to preserve a good deal of autonomy for the former Chrysler Corporation, which Daimler-Benz of Germany bought last November. Tension between the American unit and the German executives who control DaimlerChrysler has bedeviled the trans-Atlantic merger. Thomas T. Stallkamp, the second-ranking American, was forced out a month ago, and several other American executives have left the company in frustration.
1999-10-27	DaimlerChrysler Reports Stronger Results	Having discovered three months ago that hell hath no fury like an analyst scorned, DaimlerChrysler reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings today. The German auto maker said its third-quarter adjusted net income rose 14 percent to 1.51 billion euros, or $1.61 billion, compared with the 1.33 billion euros, or $1.41 billion, that Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation combined earned in the quarter a year earlier. Daimler bought Chrysler in November. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $38.56 billion, from $33.42 billion.
1999-10-19	DAIMLER'S SOUTH AFRICAN OUTPUT	The auto maker DaimlerChrysler plans to relocate production of its C-class Mercedes-Benz sedans for right-side steering markets to South Africa from Germany. The move will increase the company's investment in South Africa 31 percent, to about $212 million. No new jobs will be created in South Africa, and no jobs will be cut at the German plant in Bremen. Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)
1999-10-19	Rivals' Deal Raises Questions on Fate of British Aerospace	Ever since the end of the cold war, Europe's fragmented military industry has come to resemble a ponderous mating rite in which the surprises came not so much from the urge to consolidate as from the partners ticking the dance card. The newest unexpected coupling came last week when DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany and Aerospatiale Matra S.A. of France agreed to merge. With annual sales of $22 billion, the cross-border European behemoth would rank as the world's third-largest aerospace company after the Boeing Company and the Lockheed Martin Corporation.
1999-10-15	Daimler and Aerospatiale to Merge Their Aerospace Businesses	Overcoming national jealousies and ideological obstacles, DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany and Aerospatiale Matra S.A. of France agreed today to merge their aerospace businesses into a European behemoth with about $22 billion in annual sales. The new company, to be called the European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Company, would be the world's third-largest aerospace company after the Boeing Company and the Lockheed Martin Corporation.
1999-10-15	CANADIAN AUTO PACT THREATENED	The World Trade Organization has ruled in an interim decision that a Canadian law permitting the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler to import vehicles into Canada without paying duty violates fair trade practices. Japan and the European Union had challenged the 1956 law because Canada imposes a 6.5 percent import duty on other car makers. The final ruling is due on Nov. 25, but it can be appealed. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
1999-10-07	Daimler in Deal With Canada Workers	Less than two hours before a strike deadline, the DaimlerChrysler Corporation reached an agreement late Tuesday with the Canadian Auto Workers union on a new three-year contract covering the company's 13,800 workers in Canada. Under the agreement, DaimlerChrysler's factory workers will get annual raises of 3 percent on top of their cost-of-living adjustments; an annual holiday bonus of $1,200 (Canadian); a signing bonus of $1,000; a tuition reimbursement of $800 for workers' children, and a child-care benefit of $2,000.
1999-10-02	Auto Makers Finish Record Year on Strong Note	Customers drawn by hefty rebates bought more than 16 million new cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in the 1999 model year, breaking the sales record set in 1986. ''These are good times,'' said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president for sales, service and marketing for the General Motors Corporation, which had its best model-year results in a decade. ''The combination of affordable vehicles, high employment and buying momentum continues to propel us to record levels.''
1999-10-01	DaimlerChrysler Says Storm Will Cut Profit	DaimlerChrysler A.G. confirmed late on Wednesday that Hurricane Floyd would reduce third-quarter earnings by 9 cents to 12 cents a share. A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of nine analysts had expected DaimlerChrysler to report third-quarter earnings of $1.33 a share.
1999-09-29	G.M. Agrees To 4-Year Pact With Union	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union reached agreement on a new, four-year labor contract late tonight that would give the company's 143,200 factory workers annual raises of 3 percent plus adjustments for inflation. The union and the company jointly announced the agreement, but declined to comment further.
1999-09-27	General Motors and Union Negotiators Said to Be Close to 4-Year Agreement	General Motors and the United Automobile Workers hope to reach a new, four-year labor contract within the next several days as the relationship between the world's largest company and its main union appears to have improved considerably since last year's 54-day strike in Flint, Mich., auto industry and union officials said today. A G.M. official close to the talks said, ''They're making progress; they met until very late last night.''
1999-09-25	A Struggle Over Culture And Turf at Auto Giant	When Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation merged nearly a year ago, a buzz of excitement went through Detroit on the report that Thomas T. Stallkamp, the president of Chrysler, would become the president of the new company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., and might someday become the chairman. But as the weeks passed, it emerged that Mr. Stallkamp was really only the president of another entity, the DaimlerChrysler Corporation. This consisted of nothing more than the former Chrysler operations -- and did not even control the American divisions of DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s Mercedes and commercial truck subsidiaries.
1999-09-24	A Resignation Is Expected From Chrysler's President	Just 10 months after the trans-Atlantic merger that created DaimlerChrysler A.G., the president of Chrysler is about to resign in the wake of a bruising management clash, company executives confirmed last night. The resignation of Thomas T. Stallkamp, who was the top American executive in charge of integrating Chrysler into its new German parent, will be announced today after a meeting of DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board in Frankfurt, officials said.
1999-09-22	Ford in Pact With Canada's Auto Workers	The Ford Motor Company reached a tentative, three-year contract this evening with the union representing its Canadian workers, three hours before a threatened strike at midnight. The agreement was similar to the generous deal that DaimlerChrysler A.G. negotiated with the United Automobile Workers union last Thursday, although that contract is for four years.
1999-09-21	Possible Rift For Detroit In Labor Pact	DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s tentative contract with the United Automobile Workers contains company concessions that may create problems when the union demands similar concessions next from General Motors and Ford. DaimlerChrysler agreed in the contract to hire more employees if the work force at any factory complex falls by more than 5 percent during the four-year contract for any reason except a downturn in automobile sales.
1999-09-21	DaimlerChrysler is waving carrots and sticks to try to get dealers to treat customers right.	UNLIKE the world's fanciest hotels and restaurants, car dealerships are hardly the kinds of places people think of as rating five stars, where how people are treated matters as much as what they've come to buy. But DaimlerChrysler is spending big bucks -- more than $30 million -- on a new advertising campaign by Bozell Worldwide, a unit of Bozell Inc., to try to change that perception, at least for its 4,500 dealers nationwide. More important, the ad campaign reflects the company's response to the changing environment for car dealers, who have come under pressure in recent years as auto superstores like Car Max have come on the scene, and again as more people try to buy cars on the Internet to avoid repeating bad experiences in car dealerships.
1999-09-19	INVESTING; For DaimlerChrysler, Sticker Shock Is a Low Share Price	Article assesses reasons for lower-than-expected performance of DaimlerChrysler AG in its first year since merger; critics contend that, rather than touted merger of equals, Daimler is dominant and Chrysler is underperforming (M)
1999-09-18	Ford Facing Unrest in U.S. And Canada	After enjoying the best labor relations in the auto industry for a generation, the Ford Motor Company is likely to face a strike next week in Canada and heavy pressure in the United States from the United Automobile Workers union. Auto labor leaders on both sides of the border have been emboldened by the rich contract that the U.A.W. tentatively reached on Thursday with DaimlerChrysler A.G. The four-year contract revived a practice from the union's glory days of the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's by calling for annual wage increases of 3 percent in addition to cost-of-living adjustments that almost match the rate of inflation.
1999-09-17	DaimlerChrysler And Auto Union In Tentative Deal; One U.A.W. Local Official Calls Deal 'a Great Package'	Paving the way for contracts covering the nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers, the United Automobile Workers union and DaimlerChrysler A.G. this morning reached tentative agreement on a four-year pact calling for a $1,350 signing bonus and pay increases of 3 percent a year on top of adjustments for inflation. If workers ratify the deal later this month, as expected, they will also get heftier pension benefits and additional job security, even as the company is allowed to continue downsizing through attrition, according to local union officials. Under the current contract, auto workers have earned between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, depending on the amount of overtime they work and the level of corporate profits.
1999-09-16	Auto Industry's Contract Talks Continue	Negotiators for the United Automobile Workers and DaimlerChrysler A.G. continued their round-the-clock labor talks today after indefinitely extending their current contract, which was to expire at midnight on Tuesday. Three-year contracts with General Motors and Ford Motor were also scheduled to expire at midnight on Tuesday, and talks continued with those companies, too. The union was expected to reach an agreement with DaimlerChrysler first. In a sign that talks were progressing, the union stopped five wildcat strikes that broke out on Tuesday.
1999-09-16	For Berliners, Real-Time Traffic Intelligence	THE countless construction cranes that hang over Berlin don't just change the skyline: with construction at 35,000 sites every year, getting across town by car is a serious challenge. The routing complications caused by the two separate road systems that evolved over the 28 years that the Berlin Wall divided the city don't help. Add the extra car traffic generated by the relocation of the German seat of Government from Bonn to Berlin, and the result is traffic snarls that can paralyze roads for hours. So, like other cities around the world, Berlin is betting that the solution to its traffic problems will be a new kind of data-collection and communications technology. With money from the Berlin Government, a consortium that includes DaimlerChrysler, Siemens, BMW and Volkswagen is developing a ''traffic management center'' in the city. The project will use data collected from a variety of sources throughout Berlin to make real-time information about traffic conditions available to the public over the Internet, cell phones and palm-size devices.
1999-09-15	Auto Makers Granted Extensions As Labor Negotiations Continue	As labor talks covering the nation's 400,000 auto workers continued past the midnight expiration of current labor contracts, the United Automobile Workers union granted contract extensions that allowed auto factories to keep humming without interrupting this year's record auto sales. Late Tuesday, the union extended the Ford Motor Company contract for an indefinite time. Then it extended its contract with the General Motors Corporation. Finally, minutes before midnight, the union granted an extension to the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, the company closest to reaching an agreement with the union. That wasn't soon enough to stop wildcat strikes at DaimlerChrysler, which came as the union continued to put pressure on the company in the hours before the midnight deadline. In St. Louis, 2,800 workers building highly profitable Dodge Ram pickups walked off the job around 8:45 P.M., along with 4,400 workers building the company's bread-and-butter minivans, according to David Barnas, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman. An hour later in Kokomo, Ind., about 8,400 workers building transmissions and auto parts, walked off the job. Components built in those factories are used by some of the company's biggest money makers, its four-wheel drive sport utility vehicles. It is unclear whether the morning shift will report to work at those factories. A deal is expected first at DaimlerChrysler and is likely to call for raises of at least 3 percent annually for the next three or four years, for increased pension benefits and for strengthened job security measures for workers, according to labor and industry executives. Union and company officials have refused to disclose details of the talks. The union typically reaches a deal with one of the companies then insists the other two accept similar terms.
1999-09-15	It's a Hybrid In Sport Utility Clothes; A Car-Based Light Truck, It Obeys the Fuel Rules, and It Helps Make Money	Scheduled to go on sale next spring, the Chrysler PT Cruiser is not quite a sport utility vehicle and not really a minivan. It does not look like a conventional car, either, although it uses much the same underbody and even a few of the same parts as the Dodge Neon, which is definitely a car.
1999-09-15	Chief of Smart Car Division At Daimler to Step Down	Lars Brorsen, the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s struggling Smart car business, will resign at the end of the month. The surprise resignation, which Daimler executives disclosed here today at the Frankfurt international automobile show, came just as sales of the quirky two-seater in a class of tiny vehicles known as city cars finally appeared to be picking up.
1999-09-14	Agreement In Auto Talks Seems Closer	With the auto industry fat and happy, and both labor and management eager to keep it that way, the United Automobile Workers union moved closer to agreeing to new labor contracts with both DaimlerChrysler and the General Motors Corporation. The auto industry's three-year labor contracts covering nearly 400,000 factory workers expire at midnight on Tuesday, and with that deadline fast approaching, talks between the union and the two companies continued through the weekend and today. If no deal is reached on Tuesday, the union is likely to extend the talks rather than call a strike, labor experts said.
1999-09-11	Auto Workers Try to Wring DaimlerChrysler Concessions	Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, is demanding that DaimlerChrysler A.G. make it easier for the union to organize workers at its plants as a condition of leading industry contract talks, U.A.W. officials said. Mr. Yokich spent the last two days pressing DaimlerChrysler to go beyond a simple promise to remain neutral in U.A.W. campaigns, the officials said. The union is seeking access to employee lists and to factory floors, pledges that plants will not be shut down if the union wins and simpler election procedures.
1999-09-09	Auto Workers Choose Ford For Canada Contract Talks	The Ford Motor Company will be the pattern-setting company in labor negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, the union announced today. ''We will get a good settlement,'' Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said. ''It is time working people in our nation got a pay raise.''
1999-09-04	FRANCE URGED TO CUT STAKE	The German Government is pressing France to reduce its stake in the aerospace company Aerospatiale Matra S.A., to clear the way for a merger with DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s aerospace unit. A spokeswoman at the German Economics Ministry confirmed a report in the newspaper Handelsblatt that Siegmar Mosdorf, Germany's air and space coordinator, had met this week with officials of the consortium Airbus Industrie and asserted that the French Government should reduce its 48 percent stake in Aerospatiale. DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, known as Dasa, wants no state involvement in Aerospatiale or Airbus saying that it slows vital decisions.
1999-09-02	Auto Sales Rose Sharply In August	In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced today that their sales soared in August, with the biggest growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the highest profits. DaimlerChrysler A.G. said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States with a 2.8 percent increase.
1999-09-01	DaimlerChrysler Plans to Expand Plant	DaimlerChrysler A.G., the third-largest auto maker in the United States, plans to spend $624 million to expand its Wisconsin engine plant as part of a $3.5 billion upgrade of its United States power train operations. DaimlerChrysler said today that it would add a 500,000-square-foot plant to build an engine line in Kenosha, Wis. The plant currently produces 2.5-liter I-4 and 4.0-liter I-6 rear-wheel-drive engines for Jeep sport utility vehicles and the Dodge Dakota as well as 2.7-liter V-6 front-wheel drive versions for the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid cars.
1999-08-29	BUSINESS; At Car Dealers, a No-Haggle Policy Sets Off a Battle	Article on battle between DaimlerChrysler subsidiary Mercedes-Benz USA and Coast Automotive Group of Toms River, NJ, over car maker's new no-haggle pricing policy; several dealers say there is confusion over policy and express fear that their margins will shrink; photos (M)
1999-08-27	DaimlerChrysler Gets Big Truck Order	J. B. Hunt Transport Inc., the second-largest United States trucking company, said today that it would buy as many as 15,000 trucks from DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s Freightliner unit during a five-year period for more than $1 billion as it replaces older models. J. B. Hunt plans to switch all of its highway trucks to Freightliner's Century Class models from its current cab-over-engine vehicles. The agreement involves long-distance and local vehicles. The first deliveries are scheduled for mid-September.
1999-08-25	Ford's Labor Relations Are on Edge as G.M.'s Relax	After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Company is facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor relations at the General Motors Corporation are finally starting to improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials and auto executives say. The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said. The U.A.W. conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation, which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler A.G.
1999-08-11	Jack Laskowski, 59, U.A.W. Vice President	Jack Laskowski, an international vice president of the United Auto Workers who was in charge of negotiations with the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, died on Sunday in Lewiston, Mich. He was 59 and lived in Canton, Mich. The cause was a heart attack, a spokesman for the union, Roger Kerson, said.
1999-08-10	U.A.W. Official's Death Puts Labor-Contract Focus on Ford	The unexpected death of a labor leader over the weekend makes it likely that the Ford Motor Company will be the lead company in labor negotiations covering the auto industry's 405,000 blue-collar workers. Jack Laskowski, a vice president of the United Automobile Workers union, died on Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, the union said today. Mr. Laskowski, 59, led the labor team negotiating with DaimlerChrysler A. G.
1999-08-07	AVIATION VENTURE WITH DAIMLERCHRYSLER IS SOUGHT	Aviation units from the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler A.G. said yesterday that they were seeking approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for a joint venture in the charter aviation business. The new company, based in Pontiac, Mich., would offer charter service to destinations worldwide, the companies said in a statement. The venture would link General Motors Air Transportation Services with DaimlerChrysler Aviation. About 20 planes will be available for charter use. The venture ''allows us to reduce operational costs while not impacting existing air travel services for our employees, which remains a priority for G.M.,'' said Kenneth Emerick, G.M. travel director.
1999-08-04	Strong July and Rebates Position Auto Makers for Record Year	Auto makers dangled rebates in front of their customers last month, and like fish to bait, buyers snapped up new cars and trucks. That led to a brisk annual sales pace of 17 million vehicles and kept the industry on track for a record-setting sales year. The General Motors Corporation, which was virtually shut down by a strike in June and July last year, saw its sales jump 62.6 percent in July compared with figures in the bleak period a year earlier. Car sales jumped 68.2 percent, while sales of minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose 57.2 percent. Part of the sales increase was a result of generous rebates and discounted financing deals that G.M. began offering on July 15 on nearly every 1999 model. The deals are good through September.
1999-07-30	Daimler's Profit Trails Forecasts And the Shares Fall Sharply	Shares of DaimlerChrysler A.G. took a pounding on two continents today after it turned in flat second-quarter earnings, hurt mostly by weaker-than-expected profits from Chrysler models. The company, formed in November when Daimler-Benz A.G. bought the Chrysler Corporation, said its second-quarter adjusted net income fell three-tenths of 1 percent, to 1.48 billion euros, or $1.53 billion, compared with the 1.49 billion euros, or $1.534 billion, that the two companies together earned in the quarter a year earlier.
1999-07-13	Grand Cherokee Production Slowed by DaimlerChrysler	DaimlerChrysler A.G. is slowing production of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a sign that sales of sport utility vehicles may be growing a little less quickly. DaimlerChrysler said today that it would eliminate overtime and shorten shifts at the end of this week at its huge Jefferson North assembly plant in Detroit. The factory, the sole source of the Grand Cherokee, will start producing the vehicles at a rate of 294,000 a year, down from a previous annual rate of 354,000, said Daniel Moore, a company spokesman. Sales of the Grand Cherokee, which was redesigned for the current model year, were up 9 percent last month from a year earlier, and were up 11 percent in the first half of this year from the corresponding period last year. But the sales still have not met the company's optimistic forecasts, Mr. Moore said.
1999-07-07	Auto Industry Focuses Talks On Health Care	The soaring cost of prescription drugs for aging auto workers and retirees is the top health care issue in national labor talks pitting the United Automobile Workers union against General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler A.G., auto executives said. While many industries face rising costs for pharmaceutical benefits, the auto makers said they had particularly acute problems. Benefits consultants, who compare costs in various industries, agree.
1999-07-02	DaimlerChrysler Says Sales Fell in June, Against Trend	Surprising analysts, DaimlerChrysler A.G. said today that sales of its Chrysler-brand vehicles declined in June, which had been expected to be one of the auto industry's best sales months ever. Combined sales of the Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep brands fell 5 percent from a year ago, to 255,496 cars and trucks. Sales of the company's Mercedes-Benz vehicles, however, rose 8 percent, making June the third-best month in history.
1999-06-29	A Union March on Alabama; U.A.W. Is Facing Uncommon Odds at Mercedes Plant	Steven H. Merrill was one of the first auto workers Mercedes-Benz hired as it geared up to build sport utility vehicles here in 1994. He has gotten steady raises and a two-month training trip to Germany. He even met his wife on the assembly line. Now, the United Automobile Workers union is trying to organize the Mercedes factory, and Mr. Merrill does not want any part of it. ''I really don't believe we need the U.A.W.,'' said Mr. Merrill, 37, who earned more than $80,000 last year.
1999-06-24	RUMORS OF TRUCK DEALS	The world's largest truck maker, DaimlerChrysler A.G., denied a report that it was in talks to acquire Volvo A.B., while a separate report renewed speculation that Volkswagen A.G. is wooing the other Swedish truck maker, Scania A.B. Dagens Industri, a Swedish newspaper, said DaimlerChrysler would pay up to 160 billion Swedish kronor ($19 billion) in stock for Volvo, the world's second-largest truck maker. The report pushed Volvo shares up as much as 7.8 percent, and Scania shares up as much as 3.5 percent.
1999-06-21	Corrections	An article in Business Day on May 26 about public relations support for the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler gave an incorrect surname at one point for the manager of Golin/Harris International, a firm with partners who hold doctorates in history, economics, accounting, marketing and law. He is Richard J. Wolff, not Harris.
1999-06-18	Ford Raises Productivity At Its Plants	The big difference in labor productivity between American and Japanese auto makers in the 1980's, then a matter of considerable dismay in the United States, has been sharply reduced by Ford, but General Motors and DaimlerChrysler still lag, according to a comprehensive study released today. Two decades ago, Japanese car makers enjoyed a labor cost advantage of roughly $1,000 a vehicle, adjusted for inflation, according to Harbour & Associates, a manufacturing-consultant in Troy, Mich., which published its annual productivity report today. The labor cost difference has persisted for G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, which have only improved as quickly as the Japanese makers.
1999-06-09	Auto Negotiations Are Likely to Aim for a Longer Pact	With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal since the 1950's, auto executives and union officials say. Chastened by last summer's 54-day strike against G.M. in Flint, Mich., and enjoying the soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay produced by record auto sales, management and workers appear eager to avoid another showdown this year. Serious differences could still produce a strike, but industry and union leaders alike are now using the tamest rhetoric in many years.
1999-06-04	Child Seat Program	CHRYSLER and Mercedes-Benz dealers will begin a new service later this year: inspecting child safety seats for problems with size, installation or wear. DaimlerChrysler announced yesterday that it would offer the service free for vehicles made by the company. The National Safety Council will train auto technicians from 1,000 dealerships; they will be certified by the AAA using standards set by the Federal Government, the company said. Fisher-Price will supply several thousand seats for use as loaners if the technicians find a seat with a defect or one that a child has outgrown.
1999-06-03	Vehicle Sales Increased by 5.3% in May	Auto executives were exuberant today as May's car and truck sales propelled the industry toward its best year ever. Despite weak results from the General Motors Corporation, the industry's sales rose 5.3 percent in May compared with results in the period a year earlier, when sales were also stellar. Last month's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 17.3 million was surpassed only by a rate of 17.8 million set in December 1986. Anything more than an annual rate of 15 million rate is considered strong.
1999-06-03	A Boom Built on Big Wheels; Sales of Light Trucks Drive the Auto Industry's Expansion	Craig J. Thomas stands near the end of DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s assembly line in Fenton, Mo., and waits for a spindly orange robot to lower a pickup bed to meet the rest of a Dodge Ram truck. Then, 37 times an hour, 300 times a day, he bolts the bed to the truck and waits for the next pickup to reach him. In mid-May, he got a break from the rhythm of the robots to celebrate with other workers: the company said it would spend $435 million to expand the Ram factory.
1999-05-26	Importance of Being Persuasive; Daimler-Chrysler Merger Made an Art of Making a Case	Jurgen E. Schrempp, the man who reigns over DaimlerChrysler, has a weak spot for trial movies. One of his favorites is ''Twelve Angry Men,'' in which one juror painstakingly reverses the others' views on the guilt of a murder defendant.
1999-05-19	Where to Put the Golf Clubs? Right Next to the Hydrogen!	THE two small cars that rolled up to the State Capitol in Sacramento did not seem much different from other cars -- until you saw the hydrogen tanks in their trunks. The vehicles, one by DaimlerChrysler and the other by Ford, were propelled by fuel cells, which are nonpolluting and are seen by many experts as the technology that will replace the gasoline-burning internal-combustion engine. The event in Sacramento last month marked a milestone. Ford and DaimlerChrysler, along with the State of California, announced that the auto makers would test up to 50 of their new vehicles over the next few years, a sign that fuel cells are stepping out of the laboratory and onto the road.
1999-05-12	DAIMLERCHRYSLER ENDS TRUCK ALLIANCE WITH NISSAN	DaimlerChrysler A.G., the world's fifth-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it had ended a truck development alliance with the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's No. 2 auto maker, following Renault S.A.'s acquisition of a 37 percent stake in Nissan. DaimlerChrysler and Nissan's Nissan Diesel Motor Company began working together in July to jointly develop three- to nine-ton trucks. The break was expected. The light-truck concept remains ''economically viable'' and DaimlerChrysler will produce it through its Brazilian subsidiary, Kurt Lauk, DaimlerChrysler's management board member in charge of commercial vehicles, said in an in-house employee magazine.
1999-05-04	Several Big Auto Makers Posted Robust April Sales	In a further sign of consumers' willingness to keep spending in a robust economy, auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April. The Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., Toyota, Honda and Nissan, along with a number of smaller auto makers, reported strong sales today, and the industry as a whole is on track to match or beat its vigorous sales pace of last April.
1999-04-29	DaimlerChrysler Has 23% Rise in Profits	Fueled by strong vehicle sales in the United States and healthy heavy-truck sales, DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported today that first-quarter profits increased by 23 percent, exceeding some analysts' forecasts. Net profits totaled 1.6 billion euros, or $1.75 billion; the equivalent of $1.64 euros, or about $1.79 a share, versus 1.43 euros, or about $1.56 a share, for the corresponding period in 1998. Revenues rose 10 percent, to 35 billion euros, or about $38.28 billion. Profits and revenues were up in every category in which DaimlerChrysler competes.
1999-04-24	Mercedes Opens Brazil Plant To Build A-Class Compacts	Betting that Brazil's car market will recover from a steep decline in sales, DaimlerChrysler A.G. opened a factory today to produce Mercedes-Benz automobiles. DaimlerChrysler, which already assembles Dodge pickup trucks at a plant in southern Brazil, hopes to produce at least 25,000 A-Class compact cars in the first year at its new $820 million factory. If the Brazilian economy climbs out of a recession and manages to grow next year, as many economists are now predicting, company officials said they could almost triple annual output to 70,000 by 2000.
1999-04-22	DaimlerChrysler Weighs Sale of Stake in Unit	DaimlerChrysler A.G. said yesterday that it was considering the sale of a minority stake in its DASA aerospace unit to finance acquisitions as it gives up on the creation of a single European aerospace and military company. The move shows that DASA is not counting on alliances in Europe. DaimlerChrysler has said that plans to create a single pan-European military company are dead.
1999-04-14	DaimlerChrysler Is Accused Of Anticompetitive Practices	The European Union commission is accusing DaimlerChrysler A.G. of using anticompetitive practices, a commission spokesman said today. A two-year investigation has led to charges the auto maker broke antitrust rules by preventing its exclusive dealer networks in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain from selling Mercedes passenger cars to nonresidents of those countries, the spokesman said.
1999-04-11	Biting Hands Before They Feed Him	For a man in search of a foreign partner to contribute capital and skill to his struggling bank, Masao Nishimura, the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, is a surprisingly vocal critic of Western companies and their financial advisers. At a news conference on Wednesday, he accused Jurgen Schrempp, the head of DaimlerChrysler, of violating the terms of a contract with the Nissan Motor Company, one of I.B.J.'s biggest and most troubled clients, and otherwise excoriated the business tactics of foreigners.
1999-04-06	A DaimlerChrysler Shuffle	DaimlerChrysler A.G. said it sacrificed some United States sales of its M-Class sport utility vehicle, to bolster European supply before it starts making the vehicles there next month. In March, M-Class sales dropped 19 percent, to 3,328, from March 1998. That follows a 10 percent decline in February, despite a double-digit increase in overall United States sales of sport utility vehicles. M-Class sales for the year are down 10 percent, to 9,408. DaimlerChrysler attributed the drop to a tight supply created by increased M-Class shipments from Tuscaloosa, Ala., to Europe.
1999-04-03	NISSAN MAY END DAIMLERCHRYSLER TRUCK PACT	In the first sign of an overhaul after selling a 37 percent stake to Renault S.A. the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it might end its light-truck venture with DaimlerChrysler A.G. DaimlerChrysler had been in talks about taking a stake in Nissan but abandoned those plans last month. ''Renault aside, we're reviewing each of our product plans, and the same goes for trucks,'' a Nissan spokeswoman, Miki Obana, said. The company declined to comment on a report in a Japanese newspaper, Nihon Keizai, that it might also end its agreement to make minivans with the Ford Motor Company. Ford would say only that it has an agreement with Nissan to produce minivans through 2004.
1999-04-02	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Promise, and Pitfalls, of Fuel Cells	FUEL cells, devices that produce electricity from hydrogen with only water as a byproduct, are emerging as the auto industry's darling technology of the future -- the most promising alternative to the internal-combustion engine. Manufacturers are racing to become the first to put such a vehicle on the market. Fuel cells combine hydrogen with oxygen in an electrochemical reaction that generates electricity; the hydrogen can be carried in tanks or converted from methanol or gasoline. The cells have been used in aerospace since the 1960's, but only in the last decade have they been considered an alternative to a car's internal-combustion engine. Now, most of the world's leading auto manufacturers have fuel cell vehicles in the works. Some promise to have such a vehicle on the market within five years.
1999-04-01	DaimlerChrysler Co-Chairmen Deny Defections Are Problem	The co-chairmen of DaimlerChrysler A.G. responded angrily yesterday to recent reports of managerial troubles after last year's merger, insisting that the recent defection of a half-dozen former Chrysler executives did not pose a problem. Jurgen E. Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's co-chairman, said that whenever companies merged, some executives ended up competing for similar jobs and the losers left. But DaimlerChrysler has plenty of executives and can hire more if it needs them, he said.
1999-03-28	Daimler's Tiny Smart Car Falters After a Fast Start	SMART cars are struggling to live up to their name. DaimlerChrysler's Micro Compact Car Smart subsidiary has reduced 1999 sales goals to 100,000, from 130,000, and plans to close its factory in Strasbourg, France, for two weeks next month. And in an effort to reach its new goal, Smart has cut prices, added equipment and planned a three-month ad campaign. ''Switzerland is doing better than expected, and Germany is doing well,'' said Hans-Jurg Schar, executive vice president for marketing and sales at Micro Compact Car Smart, ''but we have to really improve in Italy and France.''
1999-03-24	Management by 2 Cultures May Be a Growing Source of Strain for DaimlerChrysler	The merger in November of Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation, presented at the time as a merger of equals, is producing considerable unhappiness among some American managers at DaimlerChrysler A.G. who contend privately that the combined company has come to be dominated by Germans. Several recent developments have worried some of the Americans, although the company's American leaders say that their subordinates should not be concerned. A half-dozen highly regarded executives have resigned or have retired early since the merger. DaimlerChrysler's fruitless negotiations this winter to buy a stake in the Nissan Motor Company of Japan were led by German executives using investment bankers in Germany. And 9 of the 11 executives in the management tier directly below the company's two chairmen are German, although the new company's management board is divided equally between Americans and Germans.
1999-03-19	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Unseen Risks For a Buyer Of Nissan	DaimlerChrysler A.G. has been painting a grim picture of the Nissan Motor Company's balance sheet -- or rather, what is absent from it. Since DaimlerChrysler stopped talking with Nissan last week about purchasing a stake in the heavily indebted Japanese auto maker, Renault of France has stepped forward with an offer. But investors seem more interested in why DaimlerChrysler walked away.
1999-03-18	Airbus Won't Be Transformed This Year, Finance Chief Says	Airbus Industrie, the passenger jet consortium jointly owned by four European companies, will not transform itself into a single corporation this year, its chief financial officer said yesterday. Airbus had planned to complete the transition from a relatively loose partnership to a private company by January. But bickering among its partners -- Aerospatiale of France, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace A.G. of Germany, British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain, known as CASA -- over the value of their stakes in a unified company has delayed the move indefinitely.
1999-03-12	Shares of Nissan Plunge and Its Credit Rating Follows Suit	Shares of Nissan plunged today and the auto maker's credit rating fell after the collapse on Wednesday of its merger talks with DaimlerChrysler A.G. The failure of the negotiations signaled serious problems not only for Nissan but also for many other auto makers. Shares in the Nissan Motor Company fell 11 percent in Tokyo today, while shares of its truck-building unit, Nissan Diesel, dropped 14 percent. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Nissan's credit rating today to junk-bond quality while Standard & Poor's, another rating agency, said it was prepared to lower Nissan's rating to junk-bond status, too, but would wait for the outcome of Nissan's efforts to raise money by selling a stake to Renault of France.
1999-03-11	DaimlerChrysler Abandons Talks About Buying Control of Nissan	DaimlerChrysler A.G. abruptly broke off negotiations today to acquire a controlling stake in Nissan Motor, Japan's huge but deeply troubled auto manufacturer. The decision, which came after face-to-face negotiations in Tokyo between the chairmen of the companies, is a big setback for Nissan's increasingly desperate search for a partner that could help it dig out from more than $20 billion in debt and six years of losses.
1999-03-11	Wondering What It Will Take to Get Nissan a Mate	Once again, the future of Japan's second-largest car maker, the Nissan Motor Company, is uncertain. The announcement today by DaimlerChrysler A.G. that it was walking away from negotiations about acquiring a controlling stake in Nissan and in its equally troubled truck-making affiliate, Nissan Diesel, ended one topic of speculation only to renew another: What will happen to Nissan?
1999-03-10	Nissan Plans To Pay Off Unit's Debts	Eager to resolve a sticking point in merger negotiations with DaimlerChrysler A.G., the Nissan Motor Company plans to announce on Wednesday that it is paying off debts at a troubled subsidiary, people close to Nissan said today. Nissan wants to reach a deal soon because credit rating agencies have been threatening to lower its rating. Nissan already has the lowest possible investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor's. A further lowering, to junk bond status, would hurt Nissan's ability to raise money it needs for development of new car models and other operations.
1999-03-04	Report Says Buyers Can Choose Clean Cars or Clean Factories	For environmentalists in the market for a new car, the choice is not an easy one. According to the Council on Economic Priorities, an environmental group based in New York, car buyers face a rock-and-a-hard-place choice: They can buy cars that were made in nonpolluting plants or cars that run clean themselves, but they cannot do both.
1999-03-03	Major Auto Makers Report Record Sales	Most major auto makers, including the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G. and American Honda, reported record sales for February. ''Since the end of the General Motors strike in August, the industry has had an incredible run of monthly records,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York. ''The reasons are the usual suspects. Car prices are reasonable, if not declining. Employment levels and consumer confidence are very high. Used-car prices are strong, making trade-ins worth more and causing people to buy new cars instead of used ones.''
1999-03-02	Newly Merged Chrysler Loses 2 Executives To Rival Ford	Two senior executives from the DaimlerChrysler Corporation joined the Ford Motor Company today, the latest of several departures by executives of the former Chrysler Corporation since its merger last November with Daimler-Benz A.G. The Daimler-Chrysler deal was presented as an alliance of equals. But auto industry experts have increasingly viewed the merger as a takeover by the German company. The loss of high-level executives is particularly unusual in an industry in which managers have traditionally stayed their entire careers with a single company.
1999-02-26	In First Combined Results, DaimlerChrysler Profit Rises	Reporting its financial results as a combined company for the first time, DaimlerChrysler A.G. said yesterday that its 1998 earnings rose 28 percent on the strength of improved sales of vehicles and Airbus planes. But the figures from DaimlerChrysler, the world's fourth-largest car maker and Europe's biggest industrial company, were at the low end of financial analysts' expectations, and contributed to a 5 percent drop in the company's share price. DaimlerChrysler closed at $95.8125 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, down $5.125.
1999-02-16	Daimler Still Weighing a Deal With Nissan	DaimlerChrysler A.G. must decide before the spring whether to take a stake in Nissan, the president of DaimlerChrysler, Jurgen Schrempp, said today. Mr. Schrempp said a purchase of a stake in the Nissan Motor Company, the second-biggest Japanese car manufacturer, looked attractive now.
1999-02-14	A New Way To Get a Grip	OUR-wheel-drive systems have been around about as long as there have been cars. Until recently, they have pretty much worked on the same principles. But these systems have been changing as four-wheel drive has become more popular even while great strides have been made in sophisticated electronics. The latest innovation is Gerodisc, used in the new Quadra-Drive system of the 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. This is a fully automatic, hydro-mechanical traction control device that improves traction and handling by limiting wheel spin.

1999-02-14	Iacocca Mourns Loss of Big Three	So what does Lee A. Iacocca, the former Chrysler chairman credited with saving the company from oblivion, think of its merger with Daimler-Benz of Germany? Not much. ''I worked 20 years to make it a Big Three,'' he said. ''If I thought it was going to be a Big Two, I wouldn't have worked so hard.'' Still, he predicted that the venture would succeed and described its authors as visionaries.
1999-02-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL / Jeep Grand Cherokee; Matching Marco Polo With Miss Manners	''ASK the man who owns one,'' Packard once suggested, on the theory that a satisfied customer provided the best advertising. So ask me about the two Jeep Grand Cherokees that have served my household over four years. You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you're unlikely to pull the wool over the Ray-Bans of anyone who logs 60,000 miles. I am happy to report that the Grand Cherokees I know best -- leased in succession from a suburban New York dealer -- have performed admirably. Despite Chrysler's lingering reputation for slipshod quality, these sport utilities have had no mechanical problems, in contrast to the cranky Jeep Wrangler that preceded them. (That Wrangler, which is now someone else's problem, dated from the era when American Motors built Jeeps, sometimes not very well.)
1999-02-08	Patents; Saving time in an emergency, a computer service stores household data for display in 911 calls.	IN case of a fire or accident, the first thing people often do is call 911. It is reassuring to know that a trained operator is standing by to help. How much better might it be if the operator already knew who was calling, where the caller lived, how to find a child's bedroom in the caller's burning house or what to tell paramedics about any drugs the caller was taking? Firefighters, the police and emergency medical teams need this information, and 911 operators must be trained to elicit those details calmly from callers who are frequently panicky. Thinking it would be more efficient for people to provide that information in advance, Robert Pons and Jay Snider have patented an emergency service they named 911-Plus.
1999-02-03	Car Makers Get Strong Start To 1999 Sales	Ford, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota and other auto makers sold new family vehicles at a blistering pace in January, a sign that the American economy's torrid growth in the fourth quarter is carrying over into the new year. With gasoline prices continuing to fall, sales of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans soared in January, rising 19 percent at DaimlerChrysler A.G. from a year earlier, 20 percent at the Ford Motor Company and 32 percent at the Toyota Motor Corporation. But car sales were also brisk after months of weakness, with DaimlerChrysler and Toyota reporting large increases while Ford's car sales dropped only because of a reduction in unprofitable car sales to rental agencies.
1999-02-02	Accounts	* Mercedes-Benz Latina, Miami, a unit of the Mercedes-Benz division of DaimlerChrysler A.G., to Bates Latin America, Miami, part of the Bates Worldwide division of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C., as the first agency to handle the unit's account throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Billings were estimated at $7 million to $10 million.
1999-01-23	DaimlerChrysler Sheds Little Light on Nissan	A much-anticipated news conference here today by DaimlerChrysler A.G. failed to clarify the future of the debt-laden Nissan Motor Company or its more-troubled truck-making affiliate. In a news release, DaimlerChrysler said only that its two chairmen, Jurgen E. Schrempp and Robert J. Eaton, met with Yoshikazu Hanawa, the president of Nissan Motor, on Thursday and that they had ''constructive discussions'' regarding the truck affiliate, the Nissan Diesel Motor Company.
1999-01-21	Federal-Mogul Contract	The Federal-Mogul Corporation, the world's largest engine-seals maker, said today that it had won a contract from DaimlerChrysler A.G. to provide seals, gaskets and other products for an engine being developed for 2003 model year vehicles.
1999-01-20	Mercedes Sets Record For Vehicle Output	The DaimlerChrysler Corporation produced a record number of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars in 1998, the company reported yesterday. Mercedes made 926,400 vehicles, up some 200,000 units, or 27 percent, for the year. The biggest increases were in the new A-class, M-class, CLK coupe and CLK convertible models, all introduced in 1997.
1999-01-15	AUTOS ON FRIDAY /Technology; Cars and Natural Gas: A Better Fit	THE Dodge Charger design study, introduced by DaimlerChrysler last week at the North American International Auto Show here, looks like a modern rendition of the 1960's muscle car from which it got its name. Under its long hood, the Charger concept car, like its predecessor, has a powerful V8 -- in this case, a supercharged 4.7-liter engine producing 325 horsepower. But instead of the gas-guzzling, pollution-belching engines of Chargers in the late 60's and early 70's, the show car has a superclean engine that runs on compressed natural gas, known as C.N.G. If the Charger were put into production, it would qualify as an ultra-low-emission vehicle in California.
1999-01-13	9 Auto Makers Form Coalition	Nine auto makers announced today that they had formed a new trade association. The members of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers are the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation of the United States; BMW A.G., Volkswagen A.G. and DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany; A.B. Volvo of Sweden, and the Mazda Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan.
1999-01-11	Universal and Dodge In Marketing Pact	Universal Studios and the Dodge division of DaimlerChrysler A. G. in Auburn Hills, Mich., have signed a multimillion-dollar marketing agreement under which Dodge will become the sole automotive promotional and advertising partner for Universal films, theme parks, new-media ventures and consumer products. Terms of the one-year agreement, which can be extended, were not disclosed. The centerpiece of the agreement is a campaign affiliating Dodge and Dodge Caravan minivans with the planned summer opening of Islands of Adventure, a theme park in Orlando, Fla. BBDO Detroit in Southfield, Mich., part of Omnicom Group, will be involved with the campaign.
1999-01-07	Auto Industry Finds Surprises At the End of a Rainbow Year	Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from which the General Motors Corporation has not fully recovered. With the last auto makers reporting their results today, the industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase from 1997.
1999-01-06	Ford and Chrysler Beat Sales Forecasts	DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Ford Motor Company beat analysts' December sales forecasts, benefiting from strong truck demand and heavy discounts as the auto industry's second-best United States sales year drew to a close. Ford, the world's No. 2 auto maker, said sales of domestic car and light-truck sales rose 6.1 percent, well above the prediction of a rise of six-tenths of a percent. Chrysler car and light-truck sales for DaimlerChrysler, the No. 5 auto maker, rose 6.9 percent, surpassing the forecast for 5 percent. The General Motors Corporation said it would beat estimates when it reports its sales on Wednesday.
1999-01-05	Talks on Aerospace Merger Continue	DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s military unit and British Aerospace P.L.C. have ''a few issues'' to resolve in merger talks and a combination is several months away, said Jurgen E. Schrempp, the co-chairman of the German company, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. British press reports have indicated that a British Aerospace-DaimlerChrysler Aerospace merger, which would create the world's third-largest military company, is days or weeks away.
1999-01-03	DaimlerChrysler Hopes Green Will Be Red-Hot	SO far, alternative fuel vehicles have tended to be commuter cars so underpowered that they can barely keep up with expressway traffic. But DaimlerChrysler is to present four concept vehicles today that run on something other than gasoline, yet have plenty of horsepower. ''Alternative fuel vehicles tend to be focused on emissions and fuel economy at the expense of performance,'' Bernard Robertson, vice president of engineering technologies at DaimlerChrysler, said recently. ''But we can't identify any interest for something green or fuel efficient that is boring, unresponsive and unsatisfying.''
1998-12-25	Mercedes Unit Picks Chief	Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, a unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G., named Bill Taylor as its president and chief executive yesterday to replace Andreas Renschler, 40, who was named this month to lead global executive development for DaimlerChrysler. Mr. Taylor, 48, has been operations vice president for the German auto maker's first United States assembly plant. Prior to joining Mercedes-Benz, he held manufacturing management jobs with the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Ford Motor Company.
1998-12-24	4 European Companies Close to Satellite Deal	Four of Europe's largest aerospace companies said yesterday that they were close to combining parts of their businesses to create Europe's biggest commercial satellite maker, with sales of more than $3 billion.
1998-12-14	Germans Seek Plan to Avoid Suits Over Nazi-Era Labor	Spurred by Germany's new Social Democratic Government and a huge trans-Atlantic merger, Germany's banks and industrial conglomerates are urgently trying to devise a broad plan to compensate Holocaust survivors and Poles, Russians and other Europeans enslaved by the Nazis. The corporations, from Deutsche Bank to Siemens and Daimler-Chrysler, are eager to free themselves from a flood of American class-action suits alleging that they profited by collaborating with the Nazis.
1998-12-06	So Long, Chrysler. It's Been Fun.	THE courtship was a whirlwind. The German-American nuptials were lavish. And, for now, DaimlerChrysler A.G. appears to be in wedded bliss. With the honeymoon on, what better time to look at the dowry that the Chrysler Corporation, which last month ceased to exist as an independent company, brought to that union?
1998-12-05	A FORMER TOP CHRYSLER EXECUTIVE IS SET TO RETIRE	DaimlerChrysler A.G. said yesterday that Dennis Pawley, who managed the Chrysler Corporation's worldwide manufacturing, will retire in January. He is the first top Chrysler executive to leave the auto maker since its acquisition last month by Daimler-Benz of Germany. Mr. Pawley, 57, was appointed to the DaimlerChrysler board of management about two weeks ago and was Chrysler's top negotiator with the United Automobile Workers. Mr. Pawley was a likely candidate to direct the bargaining with the union next year. Mr. Pawley said he would pursue a new career as a manufacturing consultant. ''This move has nothing to do with the merger,'' he said.
1998-12-04	DaimlerChrysler Plans to Lay Off 2,000	The United States unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. will lay off all 2,000 workers at its truck factory in Windsor, Ontario, to prevent the buildup of overly large inventories of its Dodge Ram vans and wagons. The company, the world's fifth-largest auto maker, will idle its workers at the Pillette Road Truck Assembly starting Friday and running through Jan. 4, a spokeswoman, Jody Ness, said. The Windsor plant is the only North American factory that builds Dodge Ram vans and wagons.
1998-12-02	Textron to Build Complex	Textron Inc. said today that it planned to build a complex near Detroit to design and develop automotive trim, as well as other products, for DaimlerChrysler A.G. The 87,000-square-foot center in Auburn Hills, Mich., will have offices, design studios and a secured mock-up area for new-vehicle development. It is scheduled to open in March and will house 250 employees. DaimlerChrysler is the biggest client of Textron Automotive's trim division.
1998-11-28	DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO IDLE 348 AT MISSOURI PLANT	DaimlerChrysler A.G., the world's fifth-largest auto maker, will idle 348 workers at its minivan plant in Fenton, Mo., in expectation of a seasonal slowdown in minivan sales. The company employs about 4,700 workers at the suburban St. Louis plant, one of two North American plants that build Chrysler minivans. DaimlerChrysler said it did not know how long the Missouri workers would be laid off. The auto maker said on Wednesday that it would suspend production next week for one week at its 2,900-worker Sterling Heights, Mich., plant to keep inventories of its Plymouth Breeze, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus small cars under control.
1998-11-18	Germans Tighten Grip on DaimlerChrysler	Shares of DaimlerChrysler A.G. began trading officially today as further signs emerged that German executives from the former Daimler-Benz A.G. would be the senior partners in the merged company. DaimlerChrysler shares, which had been trading on a when-issued basis on Friday and Monday, fell 43.75 cents, to $83.875, as the overall market was mixed. Financial analysts attributed the drop in the auto maker's stock to continued selling by stock index funds because DaimlerChrysler, unlike the former Chrysler Corporation, is not part of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
1998-11-12	Effective Today, Chrysler And Daimler-Benz Are One	After decades of close calls with bankruptcy, a Federal Government bailout and finally a recent flood of profits from minivan and Jeep sales, the Chrysler Corporation will disappear as an independent company on Thursday, merging with Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany. With $140 billion in annual sales, the new company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., will become the world's fourth largest, after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and Mitsui of Japan. DaimlerChrysler will have 428,000 employees and sell vehicles ranging from $12,120 Plymouth Neons to $137,895 Mercedes-Benz CL-600 coupes.
1998-11-06	Safeway Replaces Chrysler	The Chrysler Corporation will be replaced in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by Safeway Inc. effective at the close of trading on Nov. 12, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said. That is the day Chrysler, the No. 3 United States auto maker, is to complete its merger with Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany. S.& P. said on Oct. 1 that the merged company would not be in the index because it would be based in Germany, and the index was designed to represent the United States stock market. The CBS Corporation will replace Chrysler in the S.& P. 100 index, S.& P. said.
1998-10-27	Daimler Holders Swap Old Shares	Daimler-Benz A.G. said today that its shareholders had swapped 97 percent of their shares in the company into stock of the forthcoming DaimlerChrysler A.G., enabling the company to avoid accounting charges of 54.9 billion German marks, or $33.5 billion, as it buys the Chrysler Corporation. Daimler said Friday that at least 75 percent of its shares had been swapped, insuring that the $36 billion purchase of American auto maker would proceed. The swap is the last hurdle before the companies combine in mid-November.
1998-08-07	Chrysler's Chief Will Fare Quite Well in Daimler Merger	Whether the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz succeeds or not, Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, is guaranteed to do well, documents released by the companies showed yesterday. To persuade Mr. Eaton, 58, to stay on for three years under the combined DaimlerChrysler, he can earn nine extra years on his pension -- in addition to the three he would earn anyway. Those nine extra years alone are worth $30,000 a month for the rest of his life.
1998-05-12	Good For Them And Us	Remember when many Americans saw foreign mergers with United States companies as a sign of failure? Today the opposite is true, the latest example being the reaction to last week's proposed Daimler-Benz deal with Chrysler. In a recent survey of 2,600 managers, I found that people working for companies that served only local markets felt threatened by foreign owners. But the managers for companies with international markets -- those with the most experience with globalization -- believed there was nothing to fear from foreign conglomerates. Our own businesses have been the villains in the job-destroying downsizing disasters of the past decade. Foreigners generally don't buy American plants to close them. The people of Worcester, Mass., fought a foreign takeover of the Norton Company, a maker of abrasives and the town's largest employer, because they were afraid that a non-American owner wouldn't feel any strong community ties. Norton was eventually bought by the French Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, which, contrary to expectations, increased its job training and philanthropic gifts in the town.
1998-05-08	Daimler and Chrysler Trade Vows Before Complex Union	''Today, we are creating the world's leading automotive company for the 21st century,'' said Jurgen E. Schrempp, chairman of Daimler-Benz A.G. ''DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft.'' There was little doubt about who was in charge here today as Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation publicly outlined plans for a marriage that will meld the maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars with the company best known for Jeep Cherokees and Caravan mini-vans.
1998-05-08	Detroit Is Optimistic, Despite Shock Over the Sale of One of the Big Three	Still stunned that his employer, Chrysler, would be acquired by Daimler-Benz, Darrell Thomas, a loyal union man, managed a brave-face smile. ''Well,'' he said with a wink, ''I guess this does away with all the 'Buy American' talk.''
1998-05-08	The New Math Of Big Mergers Has a Number Of Solutions	Perhaps it is a reflection of the exuberant stock market, which places ever-higher valuations on anything that trades. Or maybe it demonstrates how many Americans -- even American journalists -- struggle with math. But once again, a big American company is being taken over and few people agree on how much the deal is worth. The deal between the Chrysler Corporation and Daimler-Benz is worth $39 billion, based on the official terms disclosed yesterday and on Wednesday's stock prices, before the terms were announced. But in announcing their pact to combine, the two companies called the deal ''a merger of equals'' worth $92 billion, a figure arrived at by combining the stock market valuations of the two companies.
1998-05-08	Labor Officials See Little to Fear in a Combination	Labor unions often cringe at mergers because such combinations frequently portend large-scale layoffs. But the giant unions representing auto workers in the United States and Germany see little to fear in Daimler-Benz A.G.'s acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation. The reason: There is little overlap in the production of the two companies, and as a result, union officials see little prospect of consolidation and layoffs.
1998-05-08	Advisers and Lawyers Stand To Get Richer in Auto Deal	Kirk Kerkorian, one of Chrysler's largest shareholders, won't be the only one walking away richer after the company merges with Daimler-Benz. The investment bankers who advised the two companies -- Credit Suisse First Boston for Chrysler and Goldman, Sachs & Company and Deutsche Bank for Daimler-Benz -- could make a combined total of $60 million to $80 million for advising the two companies on their proposed $39 billion deal, several investment bankers and lawyers said. And it is possible that figure could soar even higher, one banker said -- to as much as $100 million. Those fees do not include the army of lawyers who get their cut, too, which could tally more than $10 million.
1998-05-08	A Joining of Opposites Could Help Customers	The Daimler-Benz-Chrysler deal is essentially a merger of opposites. But after Chrysler's turn-on-a-dime management is combined with the German company's research and engineering bloodlines, customers should notice improvements in the quality, performance, safety and perhaps price of DaimlerChrysler vehicles. That, at least, is the optimistic view the companies are projecting. It's also possible, of course, that the merger will not be completed or that the benefits would fall far short of their projections.
1998-05-08	Chrysler Takes On a Foreign Partner	The proposed merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler -- at more than $35 billion the largest industrial merger ever -- appears to be good for Chrysler's shareholders and workers. The merger could boost Chrysler's European sales, now tiny, yet pose little threat to factory jobs in the United States. The two companies are vastly different. Daimler focuses on its luxury cars, Chrysler on its sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans. That means the companies cannot cut costs easily by consolidating production lines, sharing dealerships or restructuring business. But while the lack of overlap protects Chrysler workers, it also suggests that the merger, despite its size, might have little impact on the domestic or foreign auto industry. Daimler no doubt hopes the merger will raise sales of luxury cars in the American market and help it tap Chrysler's highly successful assembly and design systems. Chrysler hopes to absorb Daimler's engineering quality. Yet there will be rough spots. Daimler's, and Germany's, corporate and labor systems are greatly different from Chrysler's. German law requires, for example, that representatives of Daimler's well-paid workers sit as members of its corporate board. The history of mergers between automobile companies in different countries gives pause to anyone who thinks that culture clashes will be easily overcome.
1998-05-08	What Two Big Auto Makers Bring to the Table	DaimlerChrysler would combine Daimler-Benz's force in research, advanced technology and rear-wheel drive cars with Chrysler's speedy product development, design expertise and front-wheel drive prowess. Here are some of the companies' individual strengths.
1998-05-08	Some Cross-Border Deals May Be Star-Crossed	They seem so smart and easy. Certainly the acquisition by Daimler-Benz A.G. of the Chrysler Corporation makes cross-border mergers appear that way. But for all the excitement about that deal, such mergers -- in which a company in one country acquires a company in another -- never come without headaches, often big enough to swamp the benefits.
1998-05-08	Mergers Help Fuel a Two-Tier Global Auto Hierarchy	The global auto industry is increasingly divided into two tiers, as a half-dozen giant companies prosper while many of their smaller rivals struggle to manage heavy debts or afford the ever-rising cost of designing new cars. With the pending completion of today's acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G., each of the world's three major auto-producing regions will have two successful, global auto makers. Toyota and Honda are thriving in Japan. General Motors and Ford are enjoying record profits in the United States. Volkswagen and the new DaimlerChrysler, which will have German and American executives but will be dominated by European shareholders, will be the strongest auto makers based in Europe.
1998-05-08	Corrections	A chart yesterday with a front-page article about the planned merger between Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation referred incorrectly in some copies to the number of cars Chrysler sold in Europe last year. It was 19,244 (94,250 was the number of cars and light trucks sold).
1998-05-07	DAIMLER-BENZ WILL ACQUIRE CHRYSLER IN $36 BILLION DEAL THAT WILL RESHAPE INDUSTRY	Daimler-Benz A.G., the German industrial giant that makes Mercedes-Benz automobiles, will acquire the Chrysler Corporation in an estimated $36 billion merger expected to be announced as early as this morning. The deal would be the biggest industrial takeover in history and the biggest acquisition of any American company by a foreign buyer. It would reshape the United States automobile industry by uniting America's third-largest car maker with Germany's renowned producer of luxury cars and heavy-duty trucks.
