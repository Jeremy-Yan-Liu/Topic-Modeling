2010-08-23	In Case of Emergency: What Not to Do	Whoever suggested that all publicity is good publicity clearly never envisioned the wave of catastrophe engulfing high-profile corporations over the last year, laying waste to some of the most meticulously tailored reputations on earth, Peter S. Goodman writes in The New York Times.
2010-08-22	Three P. R. Nightmares	TOYOTA, Goldman Sachs and BP have shown some of the steepest declines in public perception this year, according to research groups that analyze corporate reputations based on online polls and phone calls. Although some experts say the online polls should be used with caution -- as the respondents may not represent the entire population -- others say they are one of the best ways to keep tabs on fast-moving public sentiment. Toyota has regained close to half the public support it lost after late January, according to daily public perception scores collected by YouGov, a market research firm. (That month, Toyota suspended sales of eight models over fears about uncontrolled acceleration.) Experts attribute Toyota's rebound to its longstanding reputation for quality and doubt about whether the company was to blame for the problems. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, has had a negative public perception score since 2008, when the government helped bail out Wall Street. And after the company was charged with fraud in April -- a case later settled -- it continued to see damage to its reputation.

2006-08-05	Repairing Some Dents In an Image; A Rise in Defects at Toyota Puts Its Reputation at Stake	The news is something no car owner wants to hear. Power steering on their hard-to-get hybrid could fail. Tires on their small pickups could bulge and possibly burst. Air bags may not inflate during a crash.

2006-07-02	AMERICAN EXPERTISE	Are Detroit's chronic problems to be blamed on the American executives who run the car companies? Toyota must not think so. It just promoted two General Motors alumni to top manufacturing jobs. Gary L. Convis, who once worked at Ford and spent 15 years as a G.M. employee before joining Toyota in 2000, was named chairman of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky, one of five Toyota factories in the United States.

2006-06-11	Hyundai Hits a Speed Bump	IT is daunting enough to mount a direct challenge to the likes of Toyota and Honda, but Hyundai's quest to join the top ranks of global automakers has been complicated by the legal troubles of its chairman in Korea and by turbulence in the top ranks of its American operations. No longer a late-night punch line, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group now ranks No. 6 in worldwide sales, according to Automotive News, a trade publication. And Hyundai was already one of the world's fastest-growing major automakers when it opened an assembly plant -- its first American factory -- in Montgomery, Ala., in 2005. Cars from Hyundai and its Kia subsidiary, which not long ago were cellar dwellers in the quality and reliability ratings of J. D. Power & Associates and other survey firms, have shown steady improvement. Some have even achieved best-in-class status.

2006-04-30	Challenging Toyota's Hybrid Hegemony	IF the crossword puzzle clue is ''hybrid car,'' the answer is probably ''Prius.'' Since Toyota brought that model to the United States six years ago, the company has basked in a green public-relations glow -- even though Honda was first with a modern gas-electric car (the Insight) and Ford sold the first hybrid S.U.V. (the Escape). But with a mix of creative engineering, clever promotion and fortunate timing, Toyota has set the de facto standard for the entire class of eco-friendly vehicles. It has licensed its software to Ford and is selling hybrid components to Nissan. Toyota has half a dozen hybrid models in showrooms or on the way -- twice as many as any other automaker -- ranging from the miserly Prius to the $100,000-plus Lexus LS 600hL.
2006-04-18	I Love My Hybrid, Even on the Highway	To the Editor: Jamie Lincoln Kitman's assertion that some hybrid vehicles get worse gas mileage than their conventionally powered counterparts may well be true. But his claim that the Toyota Prius squeezes 40 or more miles out of a gallon of gas ''only when it's being driven around town'' has not been my experience.
2006-04-16	Life in the Green Lane	IF you make your way over to the Javits Convention Center for the New York International Automobile Show -- or if you've gone to any auto show in the last year or so -- you'll know that hybrid cars are the hippest automotive fashion statement to come along in years. They've become synonymous with the worthy goal of reducing gasoline consumption and dependence on foreign oil and all that this means for a better environment and more stable geopolitics. And yet like fat-free desserts, which sound healthy but can still make you fat, the hybrid car can make people feel as if they're doing something good, even when they're doing nothing special at all. As consumers and governments at every level climb onto the hybrid bandwagon, there is the very real danger of elevating the technology at the expense of the intended outcome -- saving gas.
2006-04-15	Toyota Said to Be Considering 4 Southern States for New Plant	Toyota is considering four Southern states for the site of its eighth North American assembly plant, the latest move in an expansion that could soon make it the world's biggest car company, people involved in Toyota's decision said yesterday. The states on Toyota's list include Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The factory, if approved by directors in Japan, would be its 15th in Canada, Mexico and the United States, and would probably open late this decade.
2006-04-09	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2007 Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris; Small but Tasty Portions For a Land of Gluttony	ATTENTION, Americans: This is a test. Now that even President Bush has pronounced the nation ''addicted to oil,'' and even as hybrid-car sales boom while S.U.V.'s swoon, here come new opportunities to test your willingness to use less gasoline. You can now drive the latest wave of smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles, the so-called ''B class'' cars that are popular in most of the rest of the world. Two fine examples are the Toyota Yaris, which went on sale a few weeks ago, and the Honda Fit, which becomes available next week. Set aside any lingering pint-size prejudices -- these new subcompacts are not stripped-down penalty boxes like the economy cars of yesteryear. They are neither cramped nor bereft of creature comforts. They are even a bit stylish.
2006-04-04	U.S. Vehicle Sales Fall 2.9%, Dragged Down by G.M.	A sharp drop at General Motors helped push down auto sales nationwide in March, despite pitches from American carmakers for consumers to take advantage of the latest deals. G.M.'s ''March Madness'' promotion did little to end the skid in sales, while incentives at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler also seemed to do little to lift overall results.
2006-04-02	Hybrids for Ozzie and Harriet	RELIABLE, practical and popular, the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry are as mainstream as white bread and as exciting as mom's meatloaf. But hybrid technology has transformed versions of these family cars from conservative appliances into cutting-edge green machines. Having redesigned the Camry for 2007, Toyota joins Honda in offering a midsize sedan with a hybrid gas-electric powertrain. Honda, meanwhile, has freshened and mildly restyled its Accords, including the hybrid.
2006-04-02	The Quest for a Plugged-In Prius	JAMES LANDI, engineering manager at Electro Energy, rolled back the trunk carpet in his company's modified Toyota Prius to reveal two accessories you won't find on a production version of the hybrid car: a plug-in battery charger and a larger-than-stock battery pack capable of storing six kilowatt-hours of electricity. You can't plug in a regular Prius, of course, or any other hybrid on the market. But even six years after hybrids went on sale, the plug-in misconception is common.
2006-03-22	Study Says U.S. Companies Lag on Global Warming	European and Asian companies are paying more attention to global warming than their American counterparts. And chemical companies are more focused on the issue than oil companies. Those are two conclusions from ''Corporate Governance and Climate Change: Making the Connection,'' a report that Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmentalists, expects will influence investment decisions.
2006-03-14	2 Asian Automakers Plan Ventures in 2 States Left by U.S. Carmakers	Two states abandoned by American automobile companies are celebrating new investments by Asian automakers. Toyota of Japan, the biggest foreign automobile manufacturer in the United States, and Kia from South Korea -- a complete rookie at car building in America -- both announced new ventures that together would create 3,500 jobs.
2006-03-11	Subaru Factory in Indiana May Build Top Toyota Model	Toyota is expected to announce on Monday that it will build its Camry sedan at a plant in Indiana run by another Japanese automaker, Subaru, people who have been briefed on the plan said on Friday. Toyota announced on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday concerning the Subaru plant in Lafayette, Ind., about two hours southeast of Chicago. Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana is expected to attend, along with senior Toyota manufacturing executives.
2006-03-02	Both Ford And G.M. Scale Back	Both General Motors and Ford said Wednesday they would scale back production in the second quarter, a move that reflects their falling sales and shrinking market share in the United States. As has been the case for much of the last year, Asian automakers' sales grew steadily last month. Honda's sales rose the most, with an 8.7 percent increase. Toyota, which has become accustomed to double-digit monthly gains, had a more modest 2.4 percent increase last month.
2006-02-26	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser; Tripping the Plastic Nostalgic Fantastic	TOYOTA is now the mighty money-minting juggernaut of the automotive world. But while it may be the all-powerful Kong of carmakers, the company seems publicly ambivalent about its likely coronation as the world leader -- ''Oh, we're going to pass G.M.? Really? Gosh, should we send them a bundt cake or something?'' You'd think that the company, with more cash than Scrooge McDuck, would have a few indulgent products in its portfolio, low-volume image cars to cast a glow on the mainstream Camrys and Corollas that pay the bills. But no; these days, when a Toyota test car shows up, I think: ''Oh, my, I'm in for a very pleasant experience. This looks quite swell indeed.'' Then I lose it in the parking lot at the mall.
2006-02-26	Why Old FJ's Never Die	JONATHAN WARD and his wife, Jamie, run a time machine. Their shop, TLC, is where fanatically loyal Toyota FJ owners bring their tired, rusted-out, crunched-up Land Cruisers. The Wards turn back the clock and make the FJ's new again. ''We discovered a whole market that was waiting to be served,'' Jonathan Ward said in a recent interview. ''We can make them 100 percent new again, make them better than new with modern parts or we can make them an all-new vehicle from scratch.''
2006-02-20	A Fountain of Innovation Gets a New Leader	The workspaces of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are jammed with ideas and projects, many of which will not hit the market for years, or even decades. Groups work on projects like robots with hands that can sense what they are touching, computers that can respond to human emotion and communal cars that stack together like shopping carts to save urban space. As Frank Moss, who was named last week as the new director of the lab, said: ''My job is to live in the future 20 years from today.''
2006-02-19	Editors' Note	An article on Feb. 5 about changes in the American auto market contrasted its two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford, with the next four -- Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. It said that while those four were expected to have a combined worldwide profit of $22 billion for 2005, G.M. and Ford together had a loss of $6.6 billion worldwide. The article should have noted that G.M. reported a loss of $8.6 billion while Ford reported an overall profit of $2 billion, although Ford lost $1.6 billion from its North American auto operations.
2006-02-11	Wondering Whether General Motors Can Stage Yet Another Comeback	GENERAL MOTORS, once among the strongest of American companies, this week cut its dividend in half amid fears that it may eventually go bankrupt. It remains the world's largest carmaker, but Toyota may soon catch up. For General Motors shareholders over the last 45 years, a quick look at the stock price chart indicates that it has been a long road to nowhere. An investor who bought one share at the end of 1960, and did not reinvest dividends or distributions, now has two shares, worth about the same number of dollars he paid.
2006-02-10	Toyota Introduces Its Entry in the Big-Pickup Wars	Toyota has been building pickup trucks in Japan for 70 years and has sold them in the United States since 1964. But none have been more important than the one it introduced here Thursday, either to Toyota or to Detroit. The new Tundra pickup, introduced at the Chicago Auto Show, is the first Toyota offering of a truck as large and powerful as vehicles from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
2006-02-08	Toyota's Profit Rises 34% On Strong Global Sales	Toyota posted a record quarterly profit for the end of December, an increase of 34.1 percent over the previous year, placing Japan's largest automaker within striking distance of overtaking General Motors this year for the title of world's largest automaker. Net income for the last three months of 2005 reached 398 billion yen ($3.4 billion) on record quarterly sales and help from the weakening of the yen, which fell to 117 yen to the dollar, from 106 yen to the dollar during the October-to-December quarter. Currency depreciation added $1.1 billion to Toyota's operating profits of $4.1 billion for the period.
2006-02-05	Carmakers' Big Idea: Think Small	THE writer E. F. Schumacher would be proud. Across the automobile market in America, there is an evolving realization that small is beautiful. No longer do the industry's two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, dominate the industry -- not in profits, sales or buzz. The hottest action is now taking place among the next four companies: Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, and the Japanese automakers Toyota, Honda and Nissan.
2006-01-24	Trying to Find the Road Ahead	With its bonds downgraded to junk and its market share on the ropes, Detroit's auto industry almost looks to be in a free fall. Ford Motor Company's announcement yesterday that after three straight quarters of North American losses, it will close as many as 14 factories and eliminate up to 30,000 jobs by 2012 is another sign of dark days in the Motor City. What's really sad is that Ford is in such bad shape that few people think the restructuring and job cuts are too aggressive, even though they were larger than many auto industry analysts had been expecting. That's not all that surprising when you consider that earlier this month, the Chinese automaker Geely did something no Chinese company had ever done. At Detroit's auto show, it unveiled a Chinese car that Geely plans to upgrade and sell in the United States in 2008. The price for what could be China's first foray into America's overheated love affair with cars: around $10,000.
2006-01-24	World of Change Is Likely As Nascar Lets Toyota Join	Toyota is about to become as American as Nascar. Having dabbled in stock-car racing's lower levels in recent years, Toyota took it a step further Monday, when officials announced that it would compete in Nascar's elite Nextel Cup and Busch Series beginning in 2007. Toyota, based in Japan, becomes the first foreign-owned manufacturer to race in Nascar's premier series since Jaguar in the 1950's.
2006-01-20	Toyota to Join Top Racing Circuit	Toyota will move into Nascar's Nextel Cup and Busch Series beginning in 2007, becoming the first foreign manufacturer to compete in the top racing series since Jaguar in the 1950's. The announcement is expected Monday in a news conference at Nascar in Concord, N.C., according to a person with knowledge of the announcement who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. Toyota will join the American brands Ford, Chevrolet and Dodge in the top two levels of competition.
2006-01-20	The New 'Sputnik' Challenges: They All Run on Oil	I came to Detroit looking for the hottest new American cars. Instead, I found Sputnik. You remember Sputnik -- the little satellite the Soviets launched in 1957. The Eisenhower administration was so stunned it put the U.S. into a crash program to train more scientists and engineers so America could catch up with the Russians in the space race.
2006-01-13	Toyota Shows Big Three How It's Done; For U.S. Makers, Lessons In Efficiency and Cost Control	As General Motors and Ford struggle to remake themselves and rejoin the car wars, one company is proving what a successful American carmaker can look like: Toyota. Unlike G.M. and Ford, bogged down by dozens of models competing for the same buyers, Toyota has a well-chosen lineup of both bread-and-butter cars and trucks that sell in big volumes as well as luxury models for which it can command a higher price.
2005-12-27	Michigan's Job No. 1: Recovery; Looking to Toyota For a Helping Hand	In another era, Jennifer M. Granholm's courtship of Toyota would have been considered heresy for the governor of Michigan, where American automakers and their suppliers fueled the economic engine for decades. But with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company cutting thousands of jobs, closing plants and eliminating benefits for the shrinking number of workers still employed, the governor is vowing to ''go anywhere, do anything'' to find investment for her state.
2005-12-21	Toyota Closes In on G.M.; Signs Point Toward Japanese Maker Being The Top Seller Soon	After reigning atop the global auto industry since the depths of the Depression in the 1930's, General Motors may finally cede its spot next year to Toyota. The Japanese company's ascendancy underscores the enormous obstacles faced by G.M. on many fronts. On Tuesday, Toyota announced from its offices in Nagoya, Japan, that it planned to produce 9.06 million cars worldwide in 2006. That would be a 10 percent increase for the company, which has plants on every major continent.
2005-12-20	Toyota, With 2006 Forecast, Challenges for Top Car Maker	The Toyota Motor Company announced on Tuesday that it planned to make 9.06 million cars worldwide in 2006, a goal that could help it to snatch from General Motors the crown of world's largest carmaker, a title the Detroit company has held since 1932. Toyota's springboard would be an expected 9 percent growth in worldwide sales this year, a surge that would help make Japan's largest carmaker the world's most profitable. In 2005 Toyota expects to make 8.25 million cars worldwide.
2005-12-02	Queens Woman Gives Carjacker a Tussle	She saw him coming, and braced herself for a fight. Assuming that the tall, clean-cut man rapidly approaching her on 175th Street in Jamaica, Queens, yesterday morning sought to steal her purse, Marilyn Toppin, 65, wrapped the strap of her small black purse around her left wrist. But it was her car -- an avocado green 2000 Toyota Avalon -- that he was after.
2005-11-22	G.M. SET TO DROP 5,000 MORE JOBS AND SHUT PLANTS	General Motors, the world's largest auto company, announced details on Monday of a three-year blueprint to revive its fortunes, including 5,000 job cuts on top of 25,000 previously announced. Analysts immediately questioned whether the plan was enough, saying it lacked the speed and breadth that had helped rivals make comebacks. Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said the jobs cuts along with plant closings were ''necessary for G.M. to get its costs in line with our major global competitors.''
2005-11-07	Minivans Safer With Side Air Bags	A new method of crash-testing minivans showed that Honda, Nissan and Toyota models are among the safest when struck by a sport utility vehicle or a pickup truck, according to a report released Sunday. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety assessed the safety of six minivans by simulating a crash in which an S.U.V. or a pickup truck slammed into the side of the minivan at 31 miles an hour. The tests involved only new models that were not going to be redesigned by the manufacturer in the near future.
2005-11-05	Quarterly Net Rises 2.1% At Toyota	Net income at the Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's No. 2 car company after General Motors, rose 2.1 percent in the most recent quarter on strong sales and a favorable foreign exchange rate, the company said Friday. Operating income, however, fell 3.2 percent as Toyota increased capital spending by 50 percent to build new factories to meet robust demand for its vehicles.
2005-11-04	At Tokyo Auto Show, a Focus on Fuel, Not Fenders	From Mazda's car that promises to use hydrogen to run a rotary engine to a General Motors sports utility vehicle powered by fuel cells, carmakers are competing at the Tokyo Motor Show to send car buyers a message: They have learned the lessons of the Prius. But while Toyota has clearly hit a car industry nerve with the Prius, its gasoline-electric hybrid, Toyota's influence goes only so far. As one automaker after another made clear at the auto show, which runs through Nov. 6, Toyota is not setting a universal standard for new technologies. It may be setting the pace, but mostly what it has shown is that high gasoline prices have made buyers more open-minded to alternatives.
2005-11-02	Big Drop In October For Detroit	October, which is the start of the new model year, used to be a month for the auto industry to celebrate. This year, it was a month for Detroit to forget. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler held their lowest shares of the American market ever last month. Sales fell in the wake of high gasoline prices, fears about the economy and consumer resistance to buying cars without the big discounts the companies offered this summer.
2005-10-20	In the Hybrid's Wake, Trying to Catch Up	At the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota unveiled a futuristic car powered by a gasoline-electric engine that sounded part Jetsons, part Star Trek. With this so-called hybrid engine under the hood, the concept car was called the Prius. Fast forward to Wednesday's opening of the 2005 Motor Show. America's Big Three auto makers -- Ford Motor, General Motors and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler -- were deploying slinky models to drape themselves over concept cars running in some kind of alternative fashion: hydrogen fuel cells or gasoline-electric engines.
2005-10-09	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Avalon; A Slick Reflection of Rising Ambitions	WHEN the first Avalon glided onto American streets 11 years ago, the idea of a large Japanese sedan seemed quite foreign. Did Toyota have any business trying to build a Buick? The company, it turned out, knew what it was doing. Some 770,000 Avalons have been sold; the car has built a reputation, particularly among seasoned citizens, as a comfortable, quiet and refined alternative to Detroit's large sedans.
2005-10-05	Running on Empty	For years critics have been saying that a reliance on gas-guzzling but profitable sport-utility vehicles could not keep American car manufacturers afloat forever. On Monday, sales figures for the month of September came out, suggesting that the day of reckoning may be at hand. Large S.U.V. sales were down 43 percent last month from a year earlier. Automakers, of course, pointed a finger at Hurricane Katrina's effect on gas prices. But the explanation is really larger -- a total failure of long-term planning. Toyota's strategists and engineers had no idea what the 2005 weather would bring when they started working on a ''21st century vehicle'' in 1994. But they certainly realized that a more fuel-efficient car might be one way to succeed in a competitive market. They dedicated the resources and rolled out their first hybrid in 1997. The company spent a reported $800 million developing the Prius, ending up with roughly 650 patents on the technology. It took a little while to catch on, but Toyota nurtured and improved its product until the moment came when the new idea would finally take off. The moment has come. Prius sales were up 90 percent in September.
2005-10-04	Big S.U.V.'s Lag in Sales, Hindered By Gas Cost	The heyday of the giant sport utility vehicle keeps moving farther away as gasoline prices loom larger. In September, industrywide sales of large S.U.V.'s were down 43 percent from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. That is particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which are dependent on truck-based S.U.V.'s.
2005-09-25	Style: The Way We Drive Now : Motoring Toward A Post-Gasoline Age; The High-Performance Hybrids	''Hold on to your hat!'' Jim Burns shouted as he slammed the accelerator to the floor. With a high-pitched whine, the electric motor behind my seat burst into action, and ''the Enigma'' -- an experimental red sports car in which I was riding shotgun -- bolted forward, pressing me back into my leather seat. In about three seconds we were whipping through the San Diego State University campus at 50 miles an hour.
2005-09-08	Ford Recall Involves Millions Of Vehicles	The Ford Motor Company recalled close to four million pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles on Wednesday, saying that a leak-prone cruise control system could ignite fires. The recall, the fifth-largest by an automaker in United States history, involves some of Ford's most popular trucks and S.U.V.'s, including the nation's top-selling vehicle, the F-150 pickup. Ford Expeditions, Broncos and Lincoln Navigators are also included in the recall, which affects many models from as far back as 1994 up to 2002. Ford said owners of affected vehicles would be notified by mail immediately.
2005-09-08	Three Automakers Plan Alliance to Develop a Hybrid Car	BMW, the world's largest luxury carmaker, will join General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to develop fuel-saving gasoline-electric power systems to try to catch up with the hybrid leader, Toyota. BMW intends to have an agreement with G.M. and DaimlerChrysler later this year, the companies said yesterday. G.M. and DaimlerChrysler said in December that they would develop hybrids to offer better fuel economy and create fewer emissions than conventional gasoline engines. They signed a deal on Aug. 22.
2005-09-07	Toyota Hopes to Push Its Hybrids Beyond the Niche	With Hurricane Katrina pushing American gas prices above $3 a gallon at the pump, Toyota Motor may find itself in the right place at the right time, with a new, half-mile assembly line capable of producing gasoline-electric hybrid Prius cars at the rate of one a minute. The line, in a factory in Toyota City, is part of a strategy by Japan's largest company to expand hybrids from a niche in the marketplace (just 5 percent of its American sales now) to mainstream (25 percent of its sales by 2010).
2005-08-30	Toyota Will Sell the LexusIn Japanese Home Market	A network of 143 plush new dealerships, gleaming with marble floors and Italian sofas, is ready for business. An army of 2,000 salespeople, mechanics and managers has completed training on how to pamper demanding clients. Three car models have been redesigned with roomier interiors, brawnier motors and advanced sound and navigation systems. The preparations are for Tuesday, when Toyota will introduce its Lexus brand to a new market: Japan.
2005-08-29	The Health Factory	TODAY, going to an American hospital seems about as safe as parachuting off a bridge. An estimated 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical error, and a nearly equal number succumb to infections they acquire in hospitals. Those rates are unacceptable in the world's most medically advanced country. This month, President Bush signed a bill intended to reduce the rate of medical errors. The legislation authorizes the creation of ''patient safety organizations'' to which health care providers can report errors and near misses. On the basis of these reports, the organizations will recommend ways to avoid such mistakes. And to reduce disincentives to reporting, the bill prevents information disclosed to these organizations from being used in malpractice lawsuits.
2005-08-21	Foolishness on Fuel	There are few better illustrations of the disconnect between what lawmakers in Washington know and what they do than an incident that occurred during committee debate on the energy bill in May: Senator Dianne Feinstein offered an amendment to strengthen fuel economy standards for S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickups. When James Talent, a Missouri Republican, opposed the amendment with an argument about potential lost jobs, he drew a sharp response from Pete Domenici, the committee chairman. What's really costing jobs, Mr. Domenici said, is Detroit's failure to make the fuel-efficient cars that can compete on world markets.
2005-08-04	Toyota Develops Hybrids With an Eye on the Future	Toyota is developing 10 hybrid electric models for sale worldwide by early in the next decade, the company's top North American executive said on Wednesday. The company expects that a quarter of its sales in the United States will use the technology by then as it tries to sell one million hybrid vehicles a year worldwide. That would put it far ahead of projections for hybrid sales across the industry.
2005-07-26	A Different Beat: Toyota Raises Prices While Detroit Cuts Deeply	At a time when Detroit's Big Three automakers are offering steeply reduced ''employee discounts'' to nearly everyone who walks in the door, Toyota Motor is doing the opposite: earlier this month, it announced slight price increases on many models sold in the United States. Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, says the increases, which will affect American versions of its popular Camry sedan and some cars in its luxury Lexus lineup, are necessary because of the rising costs of steel and other raw materials.
2005-07-25	Toyota, Moving Northward	Modern American politics is dominated by the doctrine that government is the problem, not the solution. In practice, this doctrine translates into policies that make low taxes on the rich the highest priority, even if lack of revenue undermines basic public services. You don't have to be a liberal to realize that this is wrong-headed. Corporate leaders understand quite well that good public services are also good for business. But the political environment is so polarized these days that top executives are often afraid to speak up against conservative dogma. Instead, they vote with their feet. Which brings us to the story of Toyota's choice.
2005-07-03	The Car Is for Kids, But Gramps Is Driving	THE next time traffic snaps to a halt in a spectacle of brake lights, glance around. There's a good chance you'll see one of those cool hipster-mobiles -- the coupes with erector-set spoilers, the hatchbacks in emphatic colors, the boxy wagons that seem more square than a 1950's sitcom. These sorts of trendy cars, like the Toyota Matrix, the Honda Element and three varieties of Toyota's Scions, were designed and marketed expressly for 20-somethings. But the people at the wheel often look more like Ozzie and Harriet than like the serially pierced offspring of Ozzy Osbourne.
2005-06-26	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Infiniti M35 and M45; The Japanese Take the Driver's Seat	IN the late 1980's, Japanese automakers established upscale divisions with a clear mission: to challenge German supremacy in luxury automobiles. Japan's threat proved real and its fancier cars were generally good, yet BMW and Mercedes-Benz still maintained their dominance, in perception if not always in reality, for most of the last 15 years. The tables may have turned. The plush Lexus LS430, from Toyota, has edged out big German cruisers in comparison tests, not only by Consumer Reports but by some enthusiast publications. Now the turnabout seems to be occurring among midrange sport sedans, where Japan's charge is led by the Infiniti division of Nissan.
2005-06-24	Toyota Is Said to Be Planning Its Second Factory in Canada	The Toyota Motor Corporation is expected to announce next Thursday that it will build a second manufacturing plant in Canada, people who have been briefed on the company's plans said. The plant will be in Woodstock, Ontario, about 30 miles southwest of Toyota's operation in Cambridge. The plant is expected to open in 2008 and will cost about 600 million Canadian dollars ($486 million), including 125 million Canadian dollars in incentive money from the governments of Canada and Ontario.
2005-06-23	A U.A.W. Chief Awaits a G.M. Showdown	As a negotiator, Ron Gettelfinger, the United Automobile Workers president, is known more for the carrot than the stick. Just don't mistake him for easygoing. This year, he briefly banned marines stationed near Solidarity House, the union's headquarters, from parking in the union lot if they drove foreign cars or had Bush bumper stickers. And in 2001, shortly after being nominated for the union presidency, he summed up his style in one word: ''abrasive.''
2005-06-22	Shifting Michigan Southward; Foreign Automakers, Settled in South, Set Industry's Pace	By most accounts, the United States auto industry is in deep trouble. But don't tell that to the newest workers here in Alabama, where foreign carmakers are redefining the auto industry in America. Automakers from overseas first began building manufacturing plants in this country in the 1970's, largely as a defensive response to protectionist threats. But even as General Motors and Ford have been announcing thousands of job cuts, the foreign automakers are aggressively building new factories and expanding plants they opened not long ago.
2005-06-20	'Kill Bill' Did It. 'Lost in Translation' Did, Too. Now Mitsubishi Plays Up Japan's Hip Factor.	TOYOTA, Nissan and Hyundai can't seem to stop talking about how American they are. Not Mitsubishi; it wants you to know the red diamonds in its logo are as red as the rising sun. Complete with booming Japanese taiko drums and cars that bow in the customary Japanese show of respect, Mitsubishi's new advertising campaign for the Eclipse sports coupe tries to sell the company's Asian lineage.
2005-06-17	Street Ready, For Tokyo, That Is	JASON PHAM has spent about $30,000 and endless hours scouring the Internet for parts for his used Honda Civic hatchback. But there are no flames crawling up the side of the vehicle or multiple plasma-screen TV's inside to make it stand out. His goal was to make his car look like other vehicles on the road -- in Japan. ''I didn't want a car everyone else was building,'' he says. Mr. Pham, a 20-year-old from Fairfax, Va., has swapped out everything from his headlights to his oil cap for replacements from Japan. Just last month, he moved his steering wheel from left- to right-hand drive to simulate the Japanese driving experience. He even has a Japanese driver's manual that he bought on eBay for $35.
2005-06-17	As Toyota Goes ...	So I have a question: If I am rooting for General Motors to go bankrupt and be bought out by Toyota, does that make me a bad person? It is not that I want any autoworker to lose his or her job, but I certainly would not put on a black tie if the entire management team at G.M. got sacked and was replaced by executives from Toyota. Indeed, I think the only hope for G.M.'s autoworkers, and maybe even our country, is with Toyota. Because let's face it, as Toyota goes, so goes America.
2005-06-02	Sales Off Again at Ford and G.M; 2 Foreign Rivals Up	Even though General Motors and Ford Motor continued to have difficulty selling cars, they did narrow their losses last month. Toyota and Nissan, meanwhile, continued to post healthy sales gains. For the industry, sales of cars and trucks in the United States were down slightly, to about 1.5 million vehicles. According to Wards AutoInfo Bank, Americans bought 0.3 percent fewer vehicles than they did last May.
2005-05-19	Lexus Tops Owner Survey For 5th Year	Lexus drivers reported the fewest problems with their new vehicles, while owners of cars like Volvos, Porsches and Saabs on average had much more to complain about, according to the latest survey from J.D. Power & Associates. The study also found that owners were significantly more impressed with their Nissans and Hummers after giving the brands dismal ratings in last year's survey. Lexus, which is owned by Toyota, led the J.D. Power study for the fifth year in a row. Lexus was followed by Jaguar, owned by Ford, and BMW, which took the third spot. The worst performers in the study were Land Rover and Mazda, both owned by Ford, and Suzuki.
2005-05-18	Toyota to Make Hybrid in U.S.	Toyota Motor announced on Tuesday plans to build a hybrid version of its Camry sedan in the United States, the first gas-electric vehicle that the automaker will manufacture outside Japan. Toyota will start building the hybrid Camry in the second half of next year and plans to make about 48,000 of them in the first year of production. That is a healthy volume for an introductory vehicle, particularly a hybrid, and would equal about 11 percent of all Camrys sold in the United States last year.
2005-05-17	Toyota Is Said to Plan a Gas-Electric Camry	Toyota Motor is set to announce Tuesday that it plans to build a gas-electric hybrid version of its top-selling Camry sedan, people briefed on the company's plans said on Monday. The hybrid Camry, to be built at Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., plant, would be the company's first gas-electric vehicle to be produced in the United States.
2005-05-11	Profit Plunges at Toyota As It Vies for Market Share	Quarterly profits at Toyota Motor plummeted 17 percent as the company plowed more money into an ambitious plan to increase its global market share. Toyota's net profit fell to 290.7 billion yen ($2.75 billion) for the quarter that ended March 31, the company said Tuesday. Revenue, however, rose 4.2 percent to 4.88 trillion yen ($46.2 billion), as the company sold more of its cars and trucks.
2005-05-09	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; A Wealth of Materials That Say 'Material Wealth'	THE gleaming metallic surfaces inside the Scion t2B, a design study introduced at the New York auto show last March, defied easy identification. Was it steel? Fabric? The eye debated.
2005-05-04	Ford and G.M. Suffer as Buyers Shun S.U.V.'s	The latest automobile sales figures show that Americans are increasingly wary of gas-thirsty sport utility vehicles. That was particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which both saw their sales slip last month as consumers continued their steady march into Asian car companies' dealerships. Both Toyota and Nissan posted record sales gains in April, which helped push overall auto sales in North America up 1.8 percent.
2005-05-03	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Vehicle Sales Rise	Sales of cars, trucks and buses in Japan rose 11 percent in April from the same month last year, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. The increase was led by Japan's two largest carmakers, the Toyota Motor Corporation, up 14 percent, and the Nissan Motor Company, up 20 percent. The total, which excluded minivehicles, rose to 262,983 vehicles, the association said.
2005-04-27	World Business Briefing | Europe: Russia: Toyota To Build Factory	The Japanese automaker Toyota said it planned to build a manufacturing plant in the northeastern Russian region of St. Petersburg in 2007, where the company will produce its top-selling Camry model. The new plant is expected to produce 50,000 cars a year eventually, Tokuichi Uranishi, Toyota's senior managing director for Europe and Africa, said in a statement. Toyota sold 47,000 cars last year in Russia, out of total foreign car sales of just more than 353,000. Toyota's initial investment in the plant is estimated at 4 billion rubles ($144 million).

2005-04-15	G.M. and Ford Stuck in Reverse As Buyers Look Beyond Detroit	In just the last few weeks, the grand plans that were supposed to carry General Motors and Ford Motor into their second centuries have crumbled. Sales at G.M. have fallen, profits have tumbled to losses. Last week, Ford also warned of a drop in earnings. Thursday, in yet another blow, its union refused to give much ground on G.M.'s health care coverage. If that were not enough, G.M.'s stock hit a 12-year low. [Page C1.]
2005-04-10	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier; Those Baby Pickups Are Grown Up and Ready to Move Out	FOR years, while the Detroit-based automakers groomed their cash cows, the full-size pickups and S.U.V.'s that generated much of their sales revenue, Japanese companies concentrated on cars. By the time the Americans turned their attention back to automobiles -- Ford called 2004 ''the year of the car'' -- the Japanese were deploying new trucks in their assault on Fortress Detroit. Now that both Toyota and Nissan have established a toehold in full-size pickups, the companies have set their sights on the single most neglected sector of the automotive market: pickups that aren't truly large but have clearly outgrown their old ''compact'' label. Sales of less than full-size trucks have fallen by a quarter since 2000, to around 670,000 last year, partly because the offerings have been rather drab and outmoded.
2005-04-08	Made in the U.S.A. (Except for the Parts)	The back-ordered Prius, with its hybrid gasoline-electric engine, is coming into the United States as fast as Toyota can turn the car out: 7,000 were shipped from Japan in February and the same number in January. That is just one of many indicators of how the everyday needs and desires of Americans keep imports rising despite a weaker dollar. This winter, ships, planes and trucks coming from abroad also carried extra loads of costume jewelry from Austria and China; front-loading washing machines from Germany; tires from the Far East; refrigerators from Mexico and South Korea; and computers from China.
2005-04-02	U.S. Automakers Lose Ground to Rivals	Auto sales perked up in March, though domestic carmakers continued to lose ground to foreign competitors. Sales at General Motors fell 1.5 percent and were down 4.9 percent at Ford Motor from the month a year earlier, while Nissan Motor reported a 12.6 percent increase, the first time the company had sold more than 100,000 cars and trucks in the United States in a month.
2005-04-02	Hybrid-Car Tinkerers Scoff at No-Plug-In Rule	Ron Gremban and Felix Kramer have modified a Toyota Prius so it can be plugged into a wall outlet. This does not make Toyota happy. The company has spent millions of dollars persuading people that hybrid electric cars like the Prius never need to be plugged in and work just like normal cars. So has Honda, which even ran a commercial that showed a guy wandering around his Civic hybrid fruitlessly searching for a plug.
2005-03-25	TOYOTA NAMES MANAGER FOR BRANDS SOLD IN UNITED STATES	The Toyota Motor Corporation promoted Don Esmond to manage sales of the Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands in the United States, the company said yesterday. Mr. Esmond, 61, had been senior vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA and general manager of the Toyota brand. General managers of Toyota, Lexus and Scion will report to Mr. Esmond. Jim Lentz, 49, vice president for marketing, will succeed Mr. Esmond as Toyota's brand manager.
2005-03-22	A New Automaker Mantra: Emissions? What Emissions?	Several automakers, among them Toyota, Ford Motor and BMW, are financing an advertising campaign aimed at politicians that asserts that automobiles are ''virtually emission-free.'' The campaign is part of an effort by a broad coalition of automakers to present their vehicles as environmentally benign at a time when the coalition is suing California to block a new regulation to curb global warming emissions and is continuing to lobby in Washington against tougher fuel economy regulations.
2005-03-19	Honda Tries to Spruce Up a Stodgy Image	At last month's Chicago Auto Show, the Honda Motor Company offered reporters a sneak preview of a Civic coupe. The car will not be available for sale until the fall, however, and for Honda executives that cannot come soon enough. A look at recent sales figures for the current Civic shows why. After slumping 9.3 percent in January from a year earlier, Civic sales in the United States plummeted 34 percent in February, compared with February 2004. And analysts say sales of the vehicle, Honda's second-most popular after the Accord, could continue to slide through the summer.
2005-03-17	G.M. SEES A LOSS NEAR $1 BILLION; STOCK FALLS 14%	General Motors' stock fell to its lowest level in more than a decade Wednesday after the company said it expected to post a loss of nearly $1 billion for the last six months. The news set off G.M.'s largest single-day share loss since the market collapse of 1987 and further darkened Wall Street assessments of the company, the world's largest automaker. The losses reflected an increasingly harsh reality: that General Motors, which three years ago was thought to be the healthiest of the Big Three automakers in Detroit, is now considered the weakest, primarily because it is not selling enough cars at home. The losses also raised questions about the strategy of the company's chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner.
2005-03-14	MediaTalk; From Toyota, a Different Sound System	For the car and music businesses, marketing with music has been a mutually beneficial relationship: automakers stir potential customers' emotions with old classics and next-big-thing songs, and musicians get commercial exposure. Toyota's new Scion line has taken this relationship to the logical next level by founding its own record label.
2005-03-13	A Taste of Toyota's Big Ambitions	TESTED: Toyota Tundra Double Cab SR5 WHAT IS IT? Toyota's first full-size pickup with four real doors. HOW MUCH? 2005 prices: SR5 V-8 4x2, $26,785; SR5 V-8 4x4, $30,115; Limited V-8 4x2, $30,410; Limited V-8 4x4, $33,740. Tested SR5 V-8 was $31,070 with keyless entry, running boards, foglights, styled steel wheels, towing package and a few other options. REBATES? Combined $1,650 until March 31. WHAT MOVES IT? 4.7-liter V-8 (282 horsepower); five-speed automatic transmission; rear- or four-wheel drive. WILL IT HAUL MY HOUSE? Maximum payload is 1,835 pounds and towing capacity is 6,800 pounds. The Double Cab seats five or six. HOW THIRSTY? E.P.A. ratings are 16 m.p.g. in town, 18 on the highway (4x2) and 15/18 m.p.g. (4x4). My average was 15 m.p.g. SAFETY? Standard dual-stage front air bags and antilock brakes. Optional stability/traction control, side air bags and side curtains. ALTERNATIVES: Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew Cab; Dodge Ram 1500 Crew Cab; Ford F-150 SuperCrew; GMC Sierra 1500 Crew Cab; Nissan Titan Crew Cab. WHEN the Tundra arrived as a 2000 model, it was the first ''import'' competitor to the Big Three's big-selling big pickups (though Tundras are actually made in Indiana). In my road test of that new model, I found the Tundra much more sophisticated than the competition of the time, though also somewhat smaller.
2005-03-11	How Long Can G.M. Tread Water?	Since the Depression, General Motors has reigned as the world's largest automaker and a pillar of American economic might. But now the company is broadly struggling and facing the humbling possibility that it will be displaced by Toyota at the top of the auto industry within a few years. General Motors, which controlled nearly half the American market as recently as the late 1970's, held about one-quarter in February. Last week, the company said that it would produce 300,000 fewer cars and trucks in North America in the first half of this year, a 10 percent drop from a year ago.
2005-03-07	Most New Small Cars Get Lowest Rating in Crash Test	New research shows that small cars are not being built well enough to stand up to sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in side impacts. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by car insurers, conducted the research and released its report Sunday night. In it, the institute said 14 of 16 small cars received the lowest of four possible safety ratings in a side-impact collision.
2005-03-03	Taking Down the 'No Foreign Cars' Signs in Michigan	At many union halls in Michigan, signs on parking lots still warn that foreign-made cars ''will be towed away at owner's expense.'' So why is Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, pushing so hard to close a sweetheart land deal with Toyota Motor?
2005-03-02	G.M. and Ford Lose Ground In Sales Again	The gears of the domestic auto industry are grinding again, with shares of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company trading near one-year lows and the companies continuing to lose customers. Sales at G.M. fell 12.6 percent in February from the same month a year earlier, according to monthly sales reports released by automakers on Tuesday; Ford's sales fell 2.8 percent. Both companies scaled back the numbers of cars and trucks they planned to make as unsold models accumulate on dealer lots, though G.M.'s cut were deeper and it is showing few signs of a turnaround.
2005-02-20	The Talk; Why a Truck?	My 1988 FJ62 had arrived from Los Angeles that morning on the back of a flatbed truck. It was covered with bird droppings and the residue of a dozen states but was otherwise pristine. Two hours later I was at the D.M.V., attempting to get the car registered in its new home state, New York. ''Lady, do you mind if I ask what you did to this car?'' inquired the woman behind the counter.
2005-02-16	U.S. Opens Safety Inquiry on Lexus S.U.V.	Federal regulators have opened a safety investigation into 2004 models of the best-selling vehicle from Toyota Motor's Lexus division, the RX330 sport utility vehicle, after receiving complaints about failures in its power brakes. Bill Ussery, a Lexus spokesman, said the company was aware of the brake problem and issued a technical service bulletin to its dealers in September. But the company has not notified customers or recalled the vehicle because it says it does not think the problem is widespread and no injuries have been linked to it.
2005-02-14	G.M. Will Pay $2 Billion To Sever Ties to Fiat	General Motors said on Sunday that it would pay Fiat $2 billion so that it would not be forced to take over Fiat's ailing auto business, resolving a dispute between the two that had threatened to become a court battle. The companies also dissolved a five-year-old industrial partnership in which they jointly produced engines and transmissions in Europe and Latin America and jointly purchased parts, though they said they would continue to cooperate in some areas.
2005-02-14	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; Like the Jeep, Toyota's FJ Is Much Loved	IN South America it is called El Macho for its rugged looks and go-anywhere capability. Across the Australian outback, it is known as the ''troopie'' for its versatility in hauling people -- soldiers or civilians -- and cargo over extreme terrain. Safari guides in Africa, miners in Canada and farmers in California all have relied on it for decades. The Toyota Land Cruiser was conceived in the years following World War II, when Japanese companies urgently needed products to sell in export markets. Modeled after American military jeeps and British Land Rovers, the Land Cruiser models produced from 1954-84 have reached collectible status, acquiring a devoted following among restorers and off-road enthusiasts.
2005-02-14	Recycled Design For a New S.U.V.	FOR families whose garage has room for another retro-style vehicle -- perhaps to park alongside one of the recent revivals of the vintage pony car, pickup truck or Le Mans racer -- Toyota is bringing back the look of its classic S.U.V. The FJ Cruiser, a flashback to Japan's 1960's-era interpretation of the Jeep, will add a tough-looking off-road machine to the low end of Toyota's sport utility offerings. The truck, introduced last week at the Chicago auto show, will go on sale early next year at a price expected to start in the low $20,000 range.
2005-02-10	40-Year Veteran at Toyota Moves Into the Top Position	Toyota Motor, the world's most profitable car maker, shuffled its top management Wednesday as it faces a challenge Detroit would envy: how to keep a good thing going. Katsuaki Watanabe, a 40-year Toyota veteran, was appointed president, succeeding Fujio Cho, who led the company to a string of record profits and began an ambitious global expansion strategy.
2005-02-09	Toyota Reshuffles Top Management, Aiming at Growth	The Toyota Motor Corporation, the Japanese automaker, said on Wednesday that it would promote the executive vice president, Katsuaki Watanabe, 62, to president, succeeding Fujio Cho, 68, who will become vice chairman. The chairman, Hiroshi Okuda, 72, will keep his post at least until his term as Japan Business Federation chairman ends in May 2006, the company said.
2005-02-04	Expansion Costs at Toyota Limit Its Earnings Growth	Toyota, the world's second-largest carmaker, posted a 3.5 percent rise in quarterly profits on Thursday as spending on its ambitious global expansion plans curtailed growth in its earnings. Toyota, second only to General Motors in the number of cars sold last year, posted a net profit of 296.5 billion yen, or $2.85 billion, for the three months ended Dec. 31. Sales rose 6 percent, to 4.64 trillion yen, or $44.7 billion, for the quarter.
2005-02-02	In a Tough Month for Autos, Ford Takes the Biggest Fall	Month after month, Detroit continues to lose American customers to Asian competitors. Last month, it was the Ford Motor Company that lost the most, with sales falling 4.9 percent in January compared with the same month a year earlier, Ward's AutoInfoBank reported Tuesday. And financial analysts are beginning to worry about the sales pace of some of Ford's new products.
2005-01-30	What the Heck Was That Crazy Car?	WHAT may be the only Toyota Century limousine in the United States sits at a curb in Midtown Manhattan, idling quietly. Most New Yorkers pass without a glance, but others, more car savvy, do a double-take. A Toyota limousine? Here? Why? The limited-edition Century is a tourist from Japan, where cars like it often serve as land yachts for captains of industry. Toyota brought it to New York for use by company executives, including Hideaki Otaka, president and chief executive of Toyota Motor North America. Given its V-12 engine and limited-run exclusivity, it could be considered a Japanese counterpart to the Mercedes Maybach, though the Century, unlike the Maybach, is not sold or distributed in North America.
2005-01-19	BATTLE OVER PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS IN OHIO SPREADS TO CVS	The CVS Corporation, the drugstore chain, will stop honoring the insurance of Ohio's state employees and the Toyota Motor Corporation workers because their prescription plans cut retailers out of the competition for long-term refills. CVS, with more than 305 Ohio stores, will not accept the state government's drug coverage through Express Scripts Inc. as of April 18. Participation in Toyota's pharmacy network, administered by WellPoint Inc., will end Feb. 18, CVS said. The insurers do not reimburse workers with chronic conditions for maintenance prescriptions obtained at a drugstore, instead requiring use of their own mail-order services, CVS said. Another drugstore giant, Walgreen Company, stopped honoring benefits for state employees Jan. 1.
2005-01-16	Sports Cars With Promises to Keep	THE 2005 Detroit auto show comes on the heels of an election year, and it takes place amid the babble of various state-of-the-union, state-of-the-state and inauguration addresses. These are days of rhetorical excess, both in political speeches and here at Cobo Center, where the industry's visionaries communicate through the design studies known as concept cars. Both the silver-tongued public servants and the gleaming (often silver-colored) flights of automotive fancy evoke dreams, destiny and challenges. In either case, the appropriate background music is ''Promises, Promises.''
2005-01-05	3 Japanese Carmakers Gain Against Big 3 in the U.S.	For Japanese automakers, last year brought feast or famine in the United States. Toyota, Honda and Nissan's American sales continued to surge in December, according to figures released Tuesday by the automakers, as the companies made further inroads against the Big Three domestic manufacturers, particularly General Motors and Ford Motor.
2005-01-03	Smaller Car for Mayor Seeking Bigger Job	In his 11 years as mayor of this liberal city, John DeStefano Jr. has made environmental issues a priority. He altered school buses to reduce air pollutants and added bicycle lanes. He promised to buy energy from renewable sources. And he fought the reopening of a power plant that neighbors argued would sully the air. Yet, he was often criticized for arriving at news conferences and meetings that heralded these initiatives in a big black Lincoln Navigator that the city bought at his request years earlier. The car got 11 miles to the gallon, said Mr. DeStefano, 49, who is seeking the 2006 Democratic nomination for governor.
2004-12-25	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda To Sell Subcompact Car In U.S.	The Honda Motor Company will sell an inexpensive subcompact car, smaller than its Civic sedan, in the United States to compete with a growing list of new small cars from Japan. The car would be based on Honda's Fit hatchback, the best-selling car in Japan. The Fit is priced from $11,000 in Japan. Honda did not say when the car would go on sale in the United States. Toyota introduced its Scion line of subcompact cars in 2003, and Nissan Motor is planning to introduce a new subcompact model in 2007. Japan's carmakers have extensive lineups of subcompact cars in Japan and Europe but have been reluctant to offer them in the United States because of concerns they would be too small for American tastes.

2004-12-22	TOYOTA FORECASTS 7% RISE IN SALES NEXT YEAR	The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that it expected its global sales to rise 7 percent to a record 8.03 million vehicles in 2005, compared with an expected 7.47 million vehicles this year. Toyota, the world's second-largest carmaker after General Motors, has been gaining market share in the United States partly as a result of strong sales of its Camry sedan and Sienna minivan. Toyota, based in Toyota City, Japan, said it expected strong demand for its vehicles in foreign markets to continue to drive growth in the year ahead, forecasting a 10 percent increase in overseas sales compared with an estimated 2 percent increase in sales in Japan. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-12-16	Honda's Robot Advances, but to Where?	The Honda Motor Corporation introduced a new version of its humanoid robot that can jog, find its way around obstacles and respond to human touch. Developers of the robot, which looks like a child in an astronaut suit and is named Asimo, say the new model is a significant advance over earlier versions and brings them closer to a bipedal machine that can move on its own through homes and offices and interact naturally with humans.
2004-12-12	Car That Emotes, The	In June, four Japanese engineers for Toyota secured a U.S. patent for a car that they say can express moods ranging from angry to happy to sad. The car can raise or lower its body height and ''wag'' its antenna and comes equipped with illuminated hood designs -- capable of changing colors -- that are meant to look like eyebrows, eyes and even tears. The car will try to approximate the feelings of its driver by drawing on data stored in an on-board computer. So, for example, if another car swerves into an expressive car's lane, the right combination of deceleration, brake pressure and defensive steering, when matched with previous input from the driver, will trigger an ''angry'' look. As futuristic as the concept sounds, the premise isn't particularly novel. Ever since the first teenager painted the first set of licking flames onto his muscle car, people have been trying to express themselves through their automobiles. Bumper stickers, fuzzy dice, Baby on Board signs, suction-cup Garfields, Jesus fish, vanity license plates, cartoon Calvins urinating on Ford logos -- each one is meant to convey a message about the driver.
2004-12-08	Automakers Sue to Block Emissions Law In California	Toyota, General Motors and seven other automakers filed suit on Tuesday to block California's new greenhouse gas regulation, which was approved by the state in its final form in September. The suit sets up a battle between automakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Although Mr. Schwarzenegger is a fan of the Hummer, an S.U.V. with prodigious greenhouse gas emissions, he has promised nonetheless to defend the regulation, which was signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis.
2004-11-27	This Year, Ontario May Pass Michigan In Making Vehicles	Michigan has been the heart of the auto industry since Henry Ford started mass-producing the Model T a century ago, but the Midwestern state is poised to be surpassed by Ontario. The Canadian province is on course to pass Michigan this year and become the biggest auto-producing state or province in North America, according to Ward's Automotive, which tracks auto production data.
2004-11-02	Weaker Dollar Causes Toyota's Profit to Slip	Profit at the Toyota Motor Corporation slipped 1.5 percent in the most recent quarter as damage from a falling dollar offset strong increases in sales around the world. Toyota, the world's second-largest carmaker, reported net income of 297.4 billion yen ($2.8 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, as the falling dollar eroded the value of Toyota's sales in the United States.
2004-10-31	G.M. vs. Toyota: This Time, the Hare May Win	GENERAL MOTORS is the world's largest carmaker, but it is not even close to being the most valuable. At current prices, you could buy all of the company's shares if you had a spare $22 billion; Toyota Motor, by contrast, which makes about 30 percent fewer vehicles, would set you back about $140 billion. In a choice between Toyota and General Motors shares, many investors have bid up Toyota's sticker price out of faith in its ability to operate more efficiently and profitably than its American rival. Analysts say that this results from financial burdens facing G.M., as well as from better production methods and better cars that Toyota has developed over the years.
2004-10-27	At the Beijing Auto Show, Signs of a Behemoth to Come	THE Beijing auto show is starting to look a lot like auto shows in Detroit or Frankfurt or Geneva, a sign of how China has become one of the world's great industrial powers. The idiosyncratic, locally built clunkers found in other developing countries, like the Ambassador cars of India, are nearly gone. In their place are sleek models made in China by practically all of the world's multinational automakers -- sedans from Honda, minivans from General Motors and sport utility vehicles from Toyota -- and a range of locally designed cars.
2004-10-27	Three Amazing Things Your Automobile Can't Do	GADGET lovers, rejoice. The same connectivity you love at home is now available in your car. In many vehicles nowadays, you can check your e-mail, view Web sites, even watch television, from the comfort of your driver's seat. You can, that is, if you live in Europe or in Japan.
2004-10-27	Dad to Virtual Rad? Call the Digimodders	IN a world where many cars look alike, a car that reflects its owner's personality and style is more and more at a premium. Detroit knows there is a deep divide between needs and dreams: the car you require and the car to which you aspire. That's why the marketing buzzword ''aspirational'' has become the smoothest pebble in the stream of sales talk coming from that city in the last few years.
2004-10-27	My Garage Balancing Act: One Hybrid, One S.U.V.	WHEN my wife, Kit, took the Prius for a test drive, I saw the future. It wasn't the car. It was the salesman. He was a stereotypical fast-talking glad-hander. The only green he seemed to care about was our down payment. He wanted to close the deal so badly he was sweating.
2004-10-27	Green de Luxe	THE hybrid is about to enter the latte generation's comfort zone. By April, Toyota will start selling the Lexus RX400h, a sport utility vehicle that gets compact-car gas mileage.
2004-10-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Top-Selling Car	Honda Motor had Japan's best-selling model in September as its Fit compact car beat the Toyota Corolla for a second straight month. Sales of the Fit rose 7.4 percent, to 15,482 units, in September from the month a year ago, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Toyota, Japan's biggest automaker, sold 14,788 Corollas, down 16 percent.
2004-10-02	Car Sales Up 5.6% in Month, With G.M. and Toyota in Lead	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent in September from last year, with General Motors and Toyota posting double-digit gains, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The strong September, which came after a disappointing August, was indicative of the roller coaster trend the industry, in particular the domestic automakers, has encountered for several months. Often, a sluggish sales month has been followed by a big surge as automakers come back with higher cash and financing incentives and more inventive marketing programs.
2004-10-02	Ford Lays Out A Move to Cut Auto Emissions	Top executives at the Ford Motor Company have privately endorsed an aggressive goal of reining in emissions from the automaker's vehicles by 2030, joining companies like BP and Toyota in approaching the issue as a business opportunity rather than a regulatory chore. Ford's goal, according to its own internal projections, would require an improvement of about 80 percent in the fuel economy of its cars and trucks by 2030, according to people who have been informed of the plan.
2004-10-01	TOYOTA TO DOUBLE NUMBER OF PRIUS CARS ON SALE IN U.S. IN '05	The Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's largest seller of gasoline-electric automobiles, will double the number of Prius hybrid cars for sale in the United States next year to reduce the waiting period for customers. About 100,000 of the fuel-efficient, low-emission cars will be shipped to the United States in 2005, the company said in a statement. Toyota said in August that it would expand Prius monthly production to 15,000 from 10,000. Many American buyers wait six months for delivery. United States sales of the cars almost tripled through August from a year earlier, to 31,406..
2004-09-28	Toyota begins a national campaign to highlight more than a vehicle's mere 'rational attributes.'	MANY brands would love to be in Toyota's position: the company's market share is growing and it has a solid reputation for dependability and quality. But as it begins a new national advertising campaign for print and television today, Toyota is hoping to prove that the brand can appeal to a customer's emotional side.
2004-09-26	Engines of Change	Have seen a new Toyota Prius up close. I have touched it and smelled it and, without even needing to pull the key or ''fob'' from my pocket, where the car can sense it just fine, pushed its gigantic iBook-like starter button and driven it for miles and miles, fast and slow. I have been awed by the dreamy blue-green digital dashboard gauges, which seem so very far away from the steering wheel as to be reachable by only an N.B.A. player. I have, in one trip, with the two back seats down, easily hauled two air-conditioners and a 37-pound bag of dog food in the hatchback, The Prius isn't small, the way it used to be. I have wowed the kids in my son's soccer car pool who are getting close to driver-permit age and who instantly developed hopeful first-car crushes on the Prius. I have -- despite stern warnings not to -- tried to drive the Prius while at the same time watching the irresistible dash-embedded computer screen, which, with its bright cartoon representations of the engine and bar graphs displaying fuel efficiency, gives you the sensation of being a game-show contestant.
2004-09-16	Toyota Plans To Assemble Prius Hybrid In China	The Toyota Motor Corporation said on Wednesday that it would assemble and sell its fuel-efficient Prius hybrid sedan in China beginning next year with its local partner, the China FAW Group, in a move that seems intended to appeal as much to policy makers in Beijing as to car buyers in China. Toyota, the world's second-largest carmaker, is off to a late start in China, where it lags far behind rivals like Volkswagen and General Motors. Introduction of the popular Prius is part of an aggressive strategy to capture a much larger share of China's car market, already one of the world's biggest.
2004-09-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Toyota Increasing Production In China	Toyota Motor and a Chinese partner, Guangzhou Automobile Group, will spend 3.8 billion yuan ($460 million) to build a factory in southern China. The plant, in the city of Guangzhou, is scheduled to produce 100,000 Camry sedans a year beginning in 2006. Toyota, the world's second-largest carmaker after General Motors, is a latecomer to China, where it lags many of its smaller global rivals in terms of sales. Volkswagen is the market leader in China with nearly a third of sales there, followed by G.M. and Honda Motor. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-09-02	G.M. and Ford to Cut Production	General Motors and Ford Motor said today that they would cut car and truck production in the fourth quarter by as much as 7 percent because vehicles were piling up unsold in inventory. Each company experienced a sharp drop in sales last month, along with the auto industry as a whole, new figures released today show. According to Ward's AutoInfoBank, the average number of new cars and light-duty trucks sold daily last month fell by 5.6 percent from August 2003.
2004-08-28	Detroit Fights California Bid to Open Car Pool Lanes to Fuel-Conscious Import	Larry David tools around in one on his HBO series. Cameron Diaz drives one in Los Angeles. So do Leonardo DiCaprio and Rob Reiner. Here in the state capital, top elected officials, including the state treasurer and the leader of the Senate, consider one a must-have environmental credential. In car- and image-obsessed California, the Toyota Prius, a hybrid gas-electric car that costs a fraction of the price tag of luxury vehicles normally associated with the state's freeways, has now even managed to win the affection of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
2004-08-05	Auto Industry Debates Virtues of Diesels vs. Hybrids	Automakers remain divided on whether diesel or hybrid cars are the best way to improve fuel efficiency, and the split is often drawn along cultural lines. All the major manufacturers are developing cleaner diesel engines, hybrids and hydrogen fuel cells. But companies are pushing harder on different technologies to get a leg up in meeting regulations that are becoming tougher around the world, and their views were represented in comments made at a management conference here on Wednesday.
2004-08-04	Bargains Help Auto Industry Recover in July	Auto sales rebounded in July after a disappointing June, driven by hot products like the Toyota Sienna minivan and the Chrysler 300C sedan and by big incentives on sport utility vehicles, figures released on Tuesday showed. Ward's AutoInfoBank estimated that July's seasonally adjusted selling rate was 17.24 million units, a sharp increase from the 15.4 million-unit rate in June, the lowest in six years.
2004-08-04	Global Growth Gives Toyota 29% Rise in Profit	Profit at Toyota Motor jumped 29 percent in the quarter just ended as the company, the world's second-largest automaker, reaped the benefits of an ambitious global expansion with sales rising in every major overseas market. Toyota reported net income of 286.6 billion yen ($2.59 billion), or 86.22 yen a share, for the quarter ended June 30, compared with 222.6 billion yen, or 64.83 yen a share, in the same quarter last year on growing sales of minivans and sport-utility vehicles in the United States and a big jump in sales in Asia.
2004-07-28	Mitsubishi Looks for Buyers and Its Niche	With American sales of Mitsubishi, once one of the hottest car brands, in a free fall, the company's executives are trying to engineer a turnaround. It could not come too soon for dealers and employees. ''June was a terrible month. I sold 10 cars,'' said Maria Prendergast-Lunn, general manager of Auddie Brown Mitsubishi in Florence, S.C., 80 miles from the major metropolitan center of Columbia. A year ago the dealership sold 75 Mitsubishis a month.
2004-07-28	Study Says Blacks Paid More for Honda Loans	A new study has found that black customers are almost twice as likely as whites to be charged a marked-up rate when they finance a purchase through the loan subsidiary of Honda Motor, and that on average, blacks are charged higher markups than whites. The study, covering nearly 400,000 people who borrowed from the American Honda Finance Corporation from June 1999 to March 2003, was conducted by Mark Cohen, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits against several automakers. His research has been at the center of those cases.
2004-07-26	Patents; A car that can wink, laugh, cry and get angry. But nothing about its passing capabilities.	THE expression ''road rage'' usually refers to infuriated drivers who lose control of their temper and lash out at other motorists. But what if a car could also express anger, crouching low on its wheel base and glowering with red headlights like a lion about to pounce? Four inventors working for Toyota in Japan have won a patent for a car that they say can help drivers communicate better by glaring angrily at another car cutting through traffic as well as appear to cry, laugh, wink, or just look around.
2004-07-25	As Authentic as 'The Matrix' or Menudo	SCION is less about designing cars than designing a brand, one aimed at the ''youts'' of Generation Y. The division's very logo suggests a tendency to try too hard: an ambiguous fin-claw-tooth shape that seems derived from surfwear logos or team emblems of the defunct XFL. Scion is building its business on a set of generalizations about Gen Y: that 20-somethings are skeptical, distrustful of marketing, seeking what's authentic. Young buyers must discover things on their own, Scion's creed holds, finding products in the marketplace the same way they discover nightclubs that are too hip to have signs on the door.
2004-07-25	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Scion tC; Who's Your Daddy? Staid Toyota Gets a Hip Implant	SCION is the wild child of the reserved, respectable Toyota family -- the tattooed, body-pierced, trend-setting offspring with a homework assignment: bring some fresh faces into the showrooms. On sale in California since June of last year, Scions became available only this summer in the rest of the country. So far, the best-known Scion (pronounced SIGH-un) has been the quirky xB, generally known as ''the boxy one.'' Its Legoland looks are polarizing, yet love it or hate it, the xB gets noticed. Much to Toyota's surprise, the xB is outselling the more mainstream xA hatchback by 2 to 1.
2004-07-25	Catching Up to the Cost of Global Warming	ONE does not often hear financial analysts talk about climate change, but this month John A. Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, organized a teleconference to address a troubling question for Detroit's automakers: As regulators around the world move to curb global-warming emissions from cars and improve fuel efficiency, what happens if Wall Street adds up the costs? The most likely answer will not make General Motors and Ford Motor very happy. Mr. Casesa's call included a presentation by the World Resources Institute, an environmental policy group in Washington, which recently issued a report on the subject with Sustainable Asset Management, an investment group based in Zurich.
2004-07-22	Detroit Profits Most From Loans, Not Cars	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company may be two of the world's largest automakers, but they continue to make their money as banks. So with interest rates rising, and competitors like the Toyota Motor Corporation far more profitable in the industry's core business of manufacturing cars and trucks, the market has reacted cautiously to the improved earnings reports by Ford on Tuesday and G.M. on Wednesday.
2004-07-21	Ford Profit Surges on Strength in Financing, Not Carmaking	The Ford Motor Company reported a $1.17 billion second-quarter profit on Tuesday, nearly tripling its earnings from the period a year earlier. But analysts are concerned that Ford relied so heavily on its lending division in the quarter and lost money in its core business: making cars and trucks.
2004-07-11	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Toyota Sienna and Nissan Quest; All Grown Up, but Still Playing With Children	THE modern minivan turns 21 this year, and nearly every automaker in the van market is marking this passage into adulthood with an all-new or significantly revamped version of this quintessential family vehicle. No longer is the minivan a short, boxy, frumpy appliance on wheels. It has evolved into a long, rounded, slightly less frumpy appliance on wheels.
2004-07-02	Ford and G.M. Sales Both Fell More Than 11% in June	General Motors and Ford Motor said Thursday that their United States sales for June had double-digit declines, as Detroit continued to lose ground to Japanese and Korean rivals. Over all, sales in the United States were weaker than expected, down 5.97 percent from a year ago, when adjusted for an extra sales day this year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The seasonally adjusted selling rate for cars and light trucks tumbled to 15.4 million in June from 17.8 million in May, Ward's said.
2004-06-20	Ideas & Trends; Suddenly, It's Hip To Conserve Energy	GAS prices finally headed down last week, and may have peaked for the year, the Energy Department reported. This is good news for drivers and businesses. But the pattern over the last 30 years suggests that this is bad news for anyone who believes that Americans, the world's biggest oil consumers, can ever curb their energy consumption. For all the scolding about America's energy gluttony, and for all the warnings about foreign entanglements linked to oil addiction, price seems to be the only factor that moves people to change habits.
2004-06-19	Hybrid Vehicles Hit the Heartland...Barely	Julie Buhl drives a Toyota Prius in pickup country. She is one of a very few people in this tree-lined western Michigan city of 77,000 who drives a hybrid car, which uses electric power to save gasoline. People here, like everywhere else, are complaining about gas prices this summer, but traffic does not often grind to a halt in Kalamazoo, and on a recent afternoon it took only a matter of minutes to cruise from a complex of Pfizer offices downtown to the city's outskirts.
2004-06-13	From Guilt Trip to Hot Wheels	PARKED side by side on Deb and Jason DeSalvo's driveway in Montclair, N.J., amid the trappings of suburban prosperity like a newly landscaped yard and a kitchen extension, are two virtuous little cars. Once, they were curiosities popular mainly with tree-huggers, but today they are the must-have, can't-get automotive fashion statement all over the country. The car on the right is a 2002 Toyota Prius, a hybrid vehicle that seamlessly makes the transition from a gasoline engine to a battery-powered electric motor and thus gets twice the gas mileage of a conventional car. The car on the left is also a Prius, model year 2004, with the same holier-than-thou, anti-S.U.V. philosophy. But the new model has enough sex appeal for Hollywood celebrities, enough trunk space for soccer moms and enough whiz-bang gadgets for somebody who defines success as having more toys than the next guy.
2004-06-08	Some Popular S.U.V.'s Fare Badly in Rollover Tests	The rear-wheel-drive version of the Ford Explorer, the nation's best-selling sport utility vehicle, tipped up on two wheels during a rollover test performed by the government, according to results released Monday. The news comes less than a week after a woman paralyzed in an Explorer rollover accident won a $369 million judgment against the Ford Motor Company.
2004-05-30	What's New Under the Sun This Summer; Toyota Camry Solara	THINK of the Solara as a pair of sensible shoes among the Manolo Blahniks and Dada Supremes of the convertible market. The Solara carries four adults comfortably and has a goodly trunk -- almost 12 cubic feet -- for their bags. Its suspension is tuned to be gentle on the body. The controls are intuitive and easy to operate. Since it shares many parts with the nation's best-selling sedan, the Camry, this Toyota is unlikely to send you to the service department very often.
2004-05-20	The Big Three Fear That Toyota Is Becoming the Big One	Toyota may not quite be the world's largest automaker, based on vehicle sales, but it is firmly buckled in the industry's driver's seat. That reality was reinforced last week when Toyota reported $10.2 billion in earnings for its latest fiscal year, which ended in March, the most ever made in a single year by a Japanese company.
2004-05-16	Lotus Finally Lines Up a New Car for America; That English Patient Is Starting to Stir Again	THE newly Americanized Elise represents not just a successful return to the purist ideals of Lotus's founder, Colin Chapman. The Elise will once again make Lotus a presence on American roads while raising production to the highest levels in the 56 years since Chapman built his first car. Volume is a relative concept for a company like Lotus, which has sold barely more than 70,000 road cars in its lifetime, along with a much smaller but unverifiable number of racing cars and kits. Compared with, say, the 900,000 F-Series trucks that Ford will sell this year, it doesn't add up to much. But the 4,000 Elises that Lotus hopes to build at its English factory in Hethel, Norfolk, over the next 12 months is a lot more than 320, which is how many cars Lotus sold worldwide in 1993, its recent nadir.
2004-05-12	Toyota Yearly Profit Up 55% On Sales and Cost-Cutting	Profit at the Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's second-largest carmaker, increased 55 percent in the fiscal year that just ended, thanks to growing sales in all major markets and aggressive cost-cutting. Toyota, maker of the Camry sedan and the Lexus luxury car, also said on Tuesday that it expected earnings to remain at about the same level for the year ahead as the company tried to offset possible currency losses by cutting costs and increasing sales.
2004-05-06	FORD AND CHRYSLER RAISE LIGHT TRUCK INCENTIVES	Ford and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have increased incentives on light trucks after Toyota and Nissan gained market share last month. Ford is offering $1,000 and no-interest 60-month loans on Explorer sport utility vehicles, Excursion and Expedition S.U.V.'s and Freestar minivans, a spokesman, Jim Cain, said. Chrysler added $2,000 to incentives on the Durango sport utility, to a total $3,500, a spokesman, Kevin McCormick, said. General Motors has offered similar incentives since April 1. The American automakers' share of the light truck market in the first four months of this year slid to 71.9 percent from 73.8 percent a year earlier.
2004-05-06	A Zen Pond Puts Wheels on Ideas	MEET the Personal Pond, a waist-high device that looks like the offspring of a Weber grill and the Starship Enterprise. Glowing with softly colored lights, humming with ethereal sound, it was designed as an inspiration generator for luxury car designers at Lexus, Toyota's premium brand, for whom the theme machine is like an audience with a design psychotherapist. The electronic sculpture (formal name, Toyota/Lexus l'Finesse Personal Pond), a one-off, will be displayed for designers working at the company's studios in Japan, France and the United States. It was created by ECCO Design, a New York firm that has also designed blobby toothbrushes for Colgate, sleek cellphones for Virgin and ergonomic office furniture for Herman Miller. The goal, said Eric Chan, president of ECCO Design, is ''to imagine a car that incorporates the mental and physical processes of anticipation, memory and signaling, while also providing the user with luxury and comfort.''
2004-04-29	Hyundai Near Top of a Quality Ranking	For the first time, new-car buyers ranked Hyundai, the South Korean automaker, higher in initial quality than any domestic or European manufacturer, according to a survey released on Wednesday by J.D. Power & Associates The result was a coup for Hyundai, which has been trying hard to upgrade its image from cheap to classy, or at least respectable, and close the gap between it and Toyota Motor and Honda Motor.
2004-04-27	Nissan Profit Up as Luxury Models Sell Well	The Nissan Motor Company on Monday posted a small gain in net profit for the fiscal year that just ended, as strong sales in the United States of its luxury Infiniti line and other Nissan vehicles helped offset the damage caused by a rising yen. Nissan's net income for the year ended March 31 was 503.7 billion yen ($4.63 billion), up 1.7 percent from 495.2 billion yen in the period a year earlier, because of robust sales of the Infiniti G35 and the Altima sedans and the introduction of vehicles, like the Murano crossover sport utility vehicle, in segments where Nissan did not compete before.
2004-04-19	Struck in Side, Many Cars Fare Poorly In Safety Test	The results are in from the first consumer test of how passenger cars fare when struck in the side by sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. And they are not good. Ten of 13 midsize car models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group financed by car insurers, received the lowest of four possible ratings, indicating a likelihood of serious or fatal injury. The tests also showed that women were at disproportionate risk in truck-car side-impact collisions.
2004-03-30	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Toyota And Volvo Ventures	The Toyota Motor Corporation and Volvo signed separate deals to make automotive engines in China with local companies, in the latest of a string of investments by foreign manufacturers in the world's fastest-growing major auto market. Toyota, which hopes to capture 10 percent of the Chinese market by 2010, said it had formed a joint venture with China's largest carmaker First Automotive Works to build a $150 million engine plant in the northern China city of Changchun. The companies plan to make 40,000 engines next year and later raise the plant's capacity to 130,000 engines a year. Volvo plans to make 50,000 engines a year by 2010 in a $200 million venture with First Automotive and the China National Heavy Truck Corporation. Volvo will own 52 percent of the plant while each of the Chinese partners holds 24 percent. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-03-15	Now, a Robot That Toots Its Own Horn	Toyota has unveiled a humanoid robot that walks, waves its arms and bows. And, as if that were not enough, it also plays the trumpet. The four-foot-tall robot, introduced last week, is a prototype for what Toyota says will be a series of autonomous machines that it hopes to build over the next two decades to serve as personal assistants, aides for the elderly and laborers. Toyota also displayed a rolling robot and showed film of a pair of robotic legs that its engineers designed to carry a disabled person.
2004-03-10	Ford to Use Toyota's Hybrid Technology	The Ford Motor Company will license hybrid technology from the Toyota Motor Corporation in a deal that could help establish Toyota's system as a standard for the industry. Toyota has been trying to sell its hybrid system to a variety of automakers to help offset its high development cost. Ford will incorporate the Toyota technology into a hybrid system it plans to introduce late this year in a gasoline-electric version of its Escape sport utility vehicle, the two companies said yesterday in a statement.
2004-03-07	A Prius-Hummer War Divides Oscarville	IT was very early Monday morning by the time Tim Robbins lurched out of the Vanity Fair Oscar party at Mortons restaurant and toward the valet line, with his wife, Susan Sarandon, two children and his golden statue for best supporting actor, in ''Mystic River.'' The driver pulled up, not in a limousine, but in the diminutive Prius, the hybrid gas-electric car that Hollywood -- part of it, anyway -- so adores.
2004-02-19	Toyota becomes the first exclusive auto sponsor on EBay.	IN its latest effort to tap the advertising potential of the Internet, the Toyota Motor Corporation has agreed to become the first exclusive automotive sponsor on eBay, the online auction site, in a deal that promotes Toyota cars and trucks on special eBay pages and in online charity auctions. The agreement, which lasts through December, demonstrates how far Web sites will go to find new ad revenue, often by offering package deals they say are better and more engaging than scatterings of pop-up and banner ads. The deal also reflects Toyota's desire to stand out in a market that is bumper to bumper with competitors.
2004-02-16	A Shade of Green: S.U.V.'s Try to Soften Image	Can the sport utility vehicle, the bête noire of environmental advocates, be reinvented as a green machine? This year, Ford and Toyota plan to sell the first two hybrid sport utility vehicles. With carlike mileage expected, the advent of the hybrid S.U.V. may change the uniformly visceral antipathy to sport utility vehicles among environmental advocates, even if automakers are unlikely to sell enough hybrids to significantly reduce fuel consumption or pollution any time soon.
2004-02-06	Toyota Records 60% Rise in 3rd-Quarter Profits	The Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's biggest automaker by market value, said Thursday that profits rose 60 percent in the latest quarter and predicted record full-year earnings on surging sales of its RX330 sport utility vehicles and Sienna minivans in the United States. Net income rose to 286.5 billion yen ($2.72 billion), or 84.82 yen a share, in its third fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, from 179.4 billion yen, or 50.74 yen a share, a year earlier, the company said. The net income figure far outstripped the 237 billion yen forecast in an analyst survey by Bloomberg. Toyota raised its forecasts for annual vehicle sales in North America, Europe and Asia outside Japan.
2004-02-05	Ratings Seem to Show Less Chance of a Rollover	For the first time, some truck-based sport utility vehicles received as many as four out of five stars in rollover ratings, according to 2004 model ratings released yesterday by federal regulators. But the higher ratings may not necessarily mean the vehicles have become safer, because the government has changed the way it tests them. In the new tests, using real vehicles on a test track as well as mathematical calculations, the four-wheel-drive versions of several similar sport utility vehicles made by General Motors -- the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada and the new Buick Rainier -- earned four stars, even though they are virtually identical to G.M. vehicles that rated only three stars last year.
2004-01-27	Toyota Overtakes Ford as World's No. 2 Automaker	Toyota knocked the Ford Motor Company from its longtime position as the world's second-largest automaker last year, according to Toyota's final sales results, which were released on Monday. Now all that stands between Toyota and first place is General Motors, setting up a challenge to America's dominance over the global auto industry that has been years in the making. Executives at Toyota have repeatedly protested that selling more vehicles than Ford or G.M. is not their goal, in and of itself.
2004-01-18	Growth Trend: Big Pickups	TOYOTA does not have a flashing sign at the Detroit auto show telling the hometown companies to watch out. Instead, it has a bold, brash, oversize blue pickup called the FTX, a design study that sends a clear message to the competition: Toyota's next big truck will be, yes, big. Company executives conceded that the FTX, with a pugnacious grille wearing a thick crown of chrome, hints at the size and look of their next-generation Tundra, to begin production in 2006. Until this year, when Toyota introduced its larger-all-around Tundra Double Cab, its largest pickup fell short of rivals from Detroit's Big Three.
2004-01-06	Detroit to Focus on Tastes as Its Market Share Decreases	The strengthening economy and generous sales incentives led to robust car sales last year, automakers said Monday, but the American companies' share of the market continued to shrink as import brands like Toyota, Honda and BMW posted the biggest gains. Despite those declines, the American companies did not pledge to increase market share in 2004, as they have often done. Instead, they said they would look for ways to make the cars and trucks that they do sell more profitable, largely by making them more appealing to consumers.
2004-01-06	Automakers Unveil Plans for More Hybrid Models	The number of fuel-efficient hybrid models available in the United States will more than double in the next year, to seven from three, with new entries coming from Toyota, Honda and Ford Motor. Two of the new vehicles were announced at the North American International Auto Show -- one of the auto industry's most important annual product previews -- which opened here Sunday for the news media.
2003-12-28	Private Sector; Interpreter for Toyota's Growth	AS Washington lobbyist for the Toyota Motor Corporation, James R. Olson spent years developing relationships on Capitol Hill and in the White House. But in 1995, he thought that his political world had come to an end. That May, Mr. Olson watched in dismay as the Clinton administration threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on sales of Japanese luxury cars in the United States, part of a trade war with Japan over American companies gaining access to its market. The dispute was resolved a month later, but not before Mr. Olson vowed to expand Toyota's leverage in the United States. He figured that the Japanese company's clout would be much greater if it had factories in more than just one state: Kentucky.
2003-12-19	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Toyota Forecasts Growth	The Toyota Motor Corporation said its global car sales would grow 4 percent in 2004 because of demand in the United States and Japan. Toyota expects to sell 6.33 million cars next year, with sales increasing 5 percent overseas and 2 percent at home. The carmaker will update some of its cars in Japan and may start producing a full-size pickup truck. As part of its strategy to make more cars where they are sold, Toyota expects to increase production 15 percent overseas next year. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-12-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chevrolet Malibu; G.M. Refines Its Recipe For a White-Bread Car	IF you are old enough, you may have heard this before: General Motors wants to be the leader in midsize family cars. Indeed, if your memory reaches back to the 1960's and 70's, you may recall how G.M. dominated the medium-size market. Back then, the Chevrolet Malibu, and the larger Impala, were the rocks on which G.M. built a seemingly impenetrable fortress.
2003-12-14	2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Pod Car, The	If your car really loved you, it would not treat you as a simple payload to be moved crosstown or cross-country. It would be sensitive to your feelings, responsive to your wishes, attentive to your midnight ramblings and indulgent of your occasional urge to communicate with other cars. One hit of this year's Tokyo Motor Show -- the traditional showcase for the unbridled ids of Japanese auto designers -- was the Toyota Personal Mobility device, or ''P.M.'' Less a car, really, than a sort of insectlike pod for a solitary driver, this concept vehicle, powered by an electric motor, was loaded with anthropomorphic features. The prototype could adjust its ''posture,'' chivalrously standing its chassis up to let you in and then slowly rolling into a recumbent position as you picked up speed. It could sense if you were driving erratically and ask if everything was O.K. It could even blush -- a tubular light around the cockpit would change from placid blue to aroused crimson, mirroring your own emotional state (which it detects with biosensors). The color-coding would help you connect with other P.M.'s whose drivers were demonstrably on your wavelength -- or avoid those who were having bad days. And if you really wanted to get to know your new friends, a wireless text-messaging system would allow you to bounce bons mots back and forth while driving.
2003-11-30	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Lexus RX330; Low-Fat S.U.V. Substitute, Now in Extra Creamy	IN the 14 years since Lexus sprang from an upscale gleam in Toyota's eye, it has done as much to spruce up the better suburbs as Sherwin-Williams or the Lawn Doctor. Nearly 2 million Lexii have been sold, and by most accounts the owners are a pampered and satisfied -- though hardly overstimulated -- bunch. In 1998, defying the critics who scorned Lexus as a Mercedes copycat, the division placed a calculated bet on a new type of vehicle. The RX300 was taller and more outdoorsy-looking than the Lexus ES300 sedan on which it was based, but not nearly as rough-and-ready as Lexus's big LX sport utility. With its blend of car and truck characteristics, the RX practically invented an automotive category that keeps expanding despite its lack of a clever label.
2003-11-30	The Greening Of Suburbia	TOYOTA, which did not become big by thinking small, has grander plans for its Lexus RX sport utility wagon. The RX, already a generation ahead of the competition, will take another leap next fall with a hybrid gasoline-electric version that will test the willingness of the upper-middle class to vote for greener vehicles with their monthly payments. While Ford is planning to introduce a hybrid version of its Escape next year, offering an environmentally friendlier alternative to conventional S.U.V.'s, the hybrid RX will be the nation's first green luxury vehicle. How it is received will help to determine whether hybrids have broad appeal beyond environmental pioneers and Hollywood celebrities who have embraced hybrids like the Toyota Prius.
2003-11-21	Dull Finishes That Are Slick	How do you stand out in a sea of high-gloss hot rods? Go dull. That is exactly what Toyota did with its new youth car, the Scion xA, at the recent Speciality Equipment Market Association's annual convention in Las Vegas. Toyota planted the Primer xA, a tiny dull-black hatchback, among the gleaming cars. ''I think the primer look makes a statement that I'm not a fancy person, I'm not materialistic,'' said Jim Farley, a vice president in the Scion division. ''It says 'I like to work on my car.' '' He added that in the 1950's many hot-rodders drove primer-painted cars for years as they saved up for expensive paint jobs.
2003-11-18	A 'brand experience' on the monorail as adsinfiltrate new arenas.	THE trend to advertise in places that had until recently been advertising-free is accelerating, with two major marketers clambering aboard the booming brand wagon. One is Toyota Motor Sales USA, which is sponsoring the new Toyota Center in Houston, home of the Rockets and Comets basketball teams. The stadium includes elements like a Lexus Lounge, Toyota cars and trucks parked throughout the arena and even a desk staffed by representatives of local dealerships who can answer questions about the Toyota and Lexus lineups, if not inquiries about Yao Ming's teammates.
2003-11-06	Toyota Posts Record $4.8 Billion 6-Month Profit	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest carmaker, posted record profits on Wednesday in the six months through Sept. 30, with sales growing in all of its major markets. The strong performance in an otherwise sluggish market suggests that the car builder will continue to challenge DaimlerChrysler for third place in the United States. Sales in North America, where Toyota generates about three-quarters of its profits, grew, mostly because of its new Sienna minivan and unexpected demand for the Scion and Prius.
2003-11-04	Sales Fell in October for G.M. and Ford	Reporting one of the domestic automobile industry's toughest months yet this year, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said on Monday that sales fell in October from the month last year. G.M. said its sales dropped 7 percent in October, while Ford said sales fell 2 percent. Among the Big Three, only the Chrysler Corporation, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, reported a gain over last year, rising 11 percent to let it remain in third place ahead of the Toyota Motor Company of Japan, which said sales rose 11.7 percent in October.
2003-10-22	Mitsubishi Falters as Other Makers Thrive	While Toyota, Honda and Nissan prosper, Mitsubishi continues to stumble. Mitsubishi's credit rating was cut two notches on Tuesday, to further below investment grade by Standard & Poor's, which cited the company's weak sales in the United States and losses on its consumer loans.
2003-10-19	What's New? With Toyota's Scion, Youth Must Be Served	ASKED her opinion of a 2004 Scion xB parked on Bathgate Avenue in the Bronx, a 20-something woman entering an apartment building answered without stopping. ''It looks like a hearse,'' she said. ''It looks like it fell into a trash compactor, but lived.'' A number of other passers-by, informally surveyed near Fordham University, were also unimpressed by the boxy car. ''It's ugly,'' one woman said. ''It's too square. I just don't like the shape of it.''
2003-10-02	Buyers Cash In on Offers to Keep Car Sales Strong	September auto sales slowed from August but continued to show strength, surprising analysts. Customers took advantage of the latest price war. Last month, General Motors was giving away Dell computers to Saturn buyers, in addition to the usual offer of zero-percent financing and big rebates that were heaviest on remaining 2003 models.
2003-09-28	Business People; American Idols Switch To a New Model	Ruben Studdard, this year's ''American Idol'' winner, and Clay Aiken, the runner-up, electrified the audience at Toyota's annual dealer meeting, serving as the opening act for Elton John, according to a report in Newsweek last week. The only thing is, the sponsor of ''American Idol'' is the Ford Motor Company. Ford also provided vehicles for skits on the show that feature the contestants, including Mr. Studdard and Mr. Aiken.
2003-09-28	A Box Of Dreams	It's almost midnight in downtown L.A., and Rommel Momen stands near the Stock Exchange nightclub, hoping that somebody will be impressed by his car. Momen, 33, works for Scion -- Toyota's new brand, designed to appeal to Generation Y consumers ages 18 to 25. (Scion rolled out in California in June and goes on sale in the rest of the country next year.) With his arms crossed, Momen lurks quietly next to a black Scion xA on promotional display. Tilted up on silver ramps, front doors wide open, the car looks like a magic bean that's doing its best to sprout. Inside, neon-light trim gives the dashboard the aspect of a trendy bar. Momen points out ''the illuminated cup holder -- it glows in seven colors.'' The car's Pioneer stereo, enhanced by a subwoofer that takes up much of the rear cargo area, pounds out dance music. The whole presentation, he proudly notes, is ''a miniature disco on wheels.''
2003-09-27	Foreign Automakers Unleash a New Wave of Luxury	Fourteen years after Lexus luxury cars went on sale in the United States, the Toyota Motor Company opened the first Lexus assembly line in North America today. Loud music and fake smoke filled the air as an audience packed with Canadian dignitaries and Japanese executives applauded the first car to roll out of the factory, a silver RX 330 sport utility vehicle. The hubbub made it hard to hear people talking, but it did not obscure the bigger message: foreign rivals are determinedly pursuing a last redoubt of profitability in the American car market.
2003-09-10	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Stake In Auto Venture	The Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan may sell 10 percent of its Indian unit to its local partner next year, according to Vikram Kirloskar, the vice chairman of the Indian venture. Toyota Kirloskar Motor, a joint venture with Kirloskar Systems Ltd. of India, started selling cars in India in 2000. Toyota has a 99 percent stake in the venture and has invested 9 billion rupees ($195 million) in India. The Toyota factory near Bangalore makes the Qualis sport utility vehicles and the Corolla sedans.
2003-09-04	With a Torrid Month, Toyota Moves Ahead of Chrysler in Sales	The day that the American automobile industry has been dreading for years arrived today. Toyota outsold Chrysler in August, the first time one of Detroit's Big Three has fallen to fourth place. Toyota's accomplishment capped the hottest month of the year thus far for the industry, though overall sales dropped about 1 percent from August 2002, the best month last year, according to figures from Ward's Automotive Reports. Foreign car makers smashed sales records last month, but General Motors' sales were virtually unchanged from August 2002; Chrysler fell 6 percent and sales at Ford Motor plunged 13 percent from last year.
2003-08-29	My Life, My Prius	THE OWNER -- Marsha Niles, 58, labor-relations adviser, Los Angeles THE CAR -- 2001 Toyota Prius The hot car in Los Angeles isn't a Porsche. It's a Prius. A lot of celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Jackson Browne, people who could get any car they like, are buying them. I heard that Arianna Huffington, who is running for governor in the recall election, traded in her S.U.V. for one. Ed Begley Jr., the greenest actor in town, owns a Prius. When I went to pick mine up at Hollywood Toyota, the salesman said to me, ''You'll never guess who I sold a Prius to yesterday. Cameron Diaz.''
2003-08-24	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Toyota Prius; From Hybrid Seed, a Greener Harvest	HALFWAY through a 250-mile drive in the 2004 Prius, I pulled into a gas station here -- not because the hybrid gasoline-electric car was low on fuel, but because I was eager to top off the tank and make some mileage calculations. The new Prius quickly caught the eye of Dennis Reed, who was filling the tank of his wife's Mercedes-Benz ML430 sport utility. As he looked over my test car, Mr. Reed said that although he had little interest in the previous, smaller Prius, he liked the larger size and sophisticated look of the second-generation hybrid sedan. ''I could spring for this one,'' he said.

2003-08-06	Profit Falls By 9.7% At Toyota	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest automaker, said today that a stronger yen and the adoption of new accounting rules pushed its profit lower by 9.7 percent in the latest quarter. The decline, however, was smaller than expected and did little to dim the view that Toyota remains one of the world's strongest car manufacturers. Toyota's sales are growing in most major markets and its balance sheet remains rock solid. Last week, the company's credit rating was raised to the top rank, Aaa, by Moody's Investors Service.
2003-08-02	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Toyota Ratings Upgraded	Moody's Investors Service upgraded the long-term credit ratings of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's third-largest carmaker, citing its strong performance and balance sheet. Toyota's debt is now rated Aaa, the highest possible, from Aa1 before, and the outlook for its credit is stable. Moody's said the upgrading was also based on the company's ability to continue cost reduction programs and its diverse product line-up and new model plans. Toyota last had a Aaa ranking five years ago. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-07-15	TOYOTA TO EXPAND ITS NEW ALABAMA FACTORY	The Toyota Motor Corporation, the automaker, said yesterday that it would spend $20 million more at a new Alabama factory to make V-6 engines to match increased pickup truck production in North America. Toyota is adding 150 jobs, for a total of 500 at the plant, a spokesman, Dan Sieger, said. The plant, in Huntsville, Ala., opened in May with an annual capacity to build 120,000 V-8 engines. The plant will more than double its capacity to 250,000 engines, including 130,000 V-6 engines. The company built 1.21 million vehicles and more than a million engines at plants in the United States and Canada in 2002. Engines from the Alabama plant are for Tundra pickups built in Indiana and Tacoma pickups built in California.
2003-07-09	American Cars Show Gains In a Survey of Dependability	Mercedes-Benz has fallen behind its sister brand Chrysler in a closely watched report on vehicle dependability, while General Motors has surged. And Japanese vehicles continue, over all, to hold up the best. The report, issued today by J. D. Power & Associates, focuses on problems that arise over three years of ownership. Its rankings are important because most consumers say a vehicle's reputation for long-term durability is their top consideration in buying.
2003-07-02	4% Rise in Auto Sales in June Fuels Optimism at the Big Three	Nationwide auto sales rose in June, but the domestic industry continued to lose ground to foreign competitors like Toyota despite spending heavily on consumer purchase incentives. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company were upbeat in conference calls today, though, saying that they saw positive signs for industry sales in the second half of the year.
2003-06-25	Departure From Saatchi And Quick Turnaround	The other shoe dropped yesterday in the abrupt departure of Kurt Ritter from the Torrance, Calif., office of Saatchi & Saatchi. He said he would open an independent marketing consultancy that will work for the office's biggest client, the Toyota Motor Sales USA division of Toyota Motor. It was disclosed on Monday that Mr. Ritter would leave after only a month as chief executive of the office, where he supervised the Toyota Motor Sales USA account. His departure was prompted by Saatchi & Saatchi's parent, the Publicis Groupe, which hired him from General Motors, where he had most recently been general manager of the Buick and Pontiac divisions.
2003-06-24	A quick retreat from a plan to put a longtime G.M. manager in charge of Toyota's pitch.	THE PUBLICIS GROUPE is bowing to a rare display of public displeasure from a large client, the General Motors Corporation, by taking the unusual step of undoing the recent hiring of a top executive. The executive, Kurt Ritter, joined a big Publicis agency last month, after working more than 30 years for G.M., to oversee the account of a competing automaker, Toyota Motor, at a Publicis agency. Now Mr. Ritter is abruptly leaving the agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, where he had been chief executive of the office that handles the American Toyota account, to placate G.M.
2003-05-22	Poaching by Publicis Gets G.M. Riled Up	In a rare display of public displeasure, the General Motors Corporation has expressed dismay at the recent hiring by the Publicis Groupe of a senior G.M. executive to oversee the account of a competing carmaker, Toyota Motor, at a Publicis agency. Ryndee Carney, a spokeswoman for G.M. in Detroit, confirmed a report this week in Advertising Age that the company was upset about the hiring, describing executives as ''extremely disappointed.'' She said other parts of the article had ''blown out of proportion'' the company's reaction but she declined to comment further.
2003-05-09	Toyota Profit for Last Year Sets Record for Automakers	The Toyota Motor Corporation reported strong gains in profits for 2002 and one of the largest net income figures in the automotive industry's history today, mainly because of strong demand in the United States. But the company said its three-year run of strong profit growth is in jeopardy in the current year because of sluggish economic growth around the world. Toyota joined Honda Motor, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors in reaching new financial peaks in the latest fiscal year, which ended March 31. Toyota has been able to outsell its American rivals without relying nearly as heavily as they do on cash incentives to draw buyers. And the higher fuel prices and uncertain economy in the United States have tended to favor Toyota and the other Japanese makers, because their cars are more fuel-efficient and are seen as more reasonably priced.
2003-05-07	Whether a Hummer or a Hybrid, The Big Complaint Is Fuel Use	Drivers of Hummers and hybrids have something in common after all. Both are dissatisfied with how much gas their vehicles consume, according to a closely watched survey of initial quality by J. D. Power and Associates released today. Fuel consumption was listed by drivers of both General Motors' Hummer H2 and the fuel-efficient Toyota Prius hybrid as their top complaint -- though Hummer complaints dwarfed those for Prius.
2003-05-02	Auto Sales Dropped 6.1% During April	Auto sales for April improved on a sluggish first quarter, receiving a modest bump from a renewed incentive push by the Big Three, but were still below the strong levels of a year ago. ''When one considers the heavy incentives for the month, the sales levels are quite disappointing,'' said Domenic D. Martilotti, an analyst for Bear, Stearns. ''Each iteration of this zero-percent-for-60-months push, there are clearly diminishing returns. So the question is, where do we go from here?''
2003-05-02	Tiny Tables For Travel	America is, as the title of a recent book suggests, a ''Fast Food Nation.'' In some regions, the drive-through is so important that burger chains have eliminated sit-down areas altogether. But after the cashier has passed that grilled stuffed chili cheese chicken quesadilla into the car, where do you put it? Carmakers who won their stripes in the cup-holder wars have rushed to the rescue. A few of the latest S.U.V.'s come with tiny tables designed for Big Macs, Biggie Fries and Big Kings. Think of them as TV trays for travelers.
2003-04-16	With Taurus in Its Last Days, Ford Bets on 3 Cars to Take On Japan	The Ford Motor Company is starting to write the obituary of the Taurus, the last American sedan that credibly competed with Japan. Company executives said yesterday that the Taurus would be phased out in the middle of the decade and that three new vehicles Ford was developing would replace it.
2003-04-10	Suit Accuses Toyota Of Bias in Lending	A lawsuit was filed in San Francisco yesterday accusing the financing unit of Toyota Motor of discriminating against black and Hispanic car buyers in setting the interest rates on their dealer-arranged loans. The suit was filed in California Superior Court by a team of lawyers that includes Bill Lann Lee, who ran the Justice Department's civil rights division during the Clinton administration. He is now a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein in San Francisco.
2003-04-10	Toyota Dealer Group Is Starting a Review	The Greater New York Toyota Dealers Association, which includes more than 100 dealers, has begun a review for its account, which has been handled by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York for more than 20 years. Billings were estimated at $90 million. Dennis Lauzon, president at the association, confirmed a report of the review in Adweek. Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe, will participate in the review, he said, declining to comment further. A decision in the review, being handled by Roth Associates in New York, is expected by August.
2003-04-02	Detroit on a Mission: No Slip in Auto Sales	Auto sales continued their sluggish pace last month, according to figures released today, prompting the Big Three automakers to broaden their no-interest loan offers. Sales actually fell less than many analysts had expected in March, just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and cars were still selling at a fairly healthy rate. But automakers are clearly worried enough to offer a new round of deals that General Motors called unprecedented, setting up a test for the industry in April.
2003-03-09	HOT WHEELS	The rate of increase for auto theft in New Jersey was higher than the national average in 2001, and the most stolen vehicle in the state was the Toyota Camry, followed by the Honda Accord, according to the Web site of the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit group supported by the insurance industry (www.nicb.org).

2003-03-06	California Offers Change In Car Rules	California is seeking to compromise with automakers by dropping a requirement that they sell electric cars, the state's latest attempt to persuade carmakers to end their opposition to the program. The California Air Resources Board outlined proposed changes to the zero-emission vehicle program today that would let companies sell more gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell autos instead of battery-powered cars starting with 2005 models, a spokesman, Dimitri Stanich, said.
2003-02-28	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Exports Gain	Exports of Japanese vehicles increased 16.8 percent in January from a year earlier as carmakers supplemented onshore production in North America and Europe. Auto exports, which hit a nine-year high in 2002, have risen for 13 consecutive months. Shipments by Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Mitsubishi all rose more than 25 percent in January.

2003-02-15	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: New Market For Luxury Car	The Toyota Motor Corporation will start selling its luxury Lexus brand in Japan in 2005, part of the company's efforts to strengthen its grip on the domestic market. Until now, Lexus cars have been sold only in the United States. Toyota will also combine two of its five domestic sales divisions, as it consolidates ownership of its 5,000 nationwide dealerships.

2003-02-06	Toyota to Build Assembly Plant in Texas	Toyota Motor said today that its profits nearly doubled in the last quarter of 2002 and announced that it would build a new assembly plant in Texas to challenge the Big Three automakers in areas where they traditionally dominate. Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, plans to invest $800 million in the new factory in San Antonio. It expects to produce 150,000 Tundra pickup trucks a year when the plant opens in 2006.
2003-02-03	Toyota Seeks Agency for Prius	The Toyota Motor Corporation in Tokyo has begun a search for an agency to handle creative duties for a worldwide campaign for the Prius hybrid car. Spending for the campaign, to begin in September, has not been determined. Toyota spent $10.3 million in the United States to advertise the Prius in major media in the first 10 months of 2002, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. Cindy Knight, a spokeswoman at Toyota Motor Sales in Torrance, Calif., the American unit of Toyota, confirmed a report of the review in the online edition of Adweek.
2003-01-28	Hybrid Autos Quick to Pass Curiosity Stage	Hybrids, vehicles that save gasoline by combining electric motors with internal combustion engines, are emerging as the first alternative-powered cars to show signs of catching on with automakers and some consumers since the automobile's early days. Toyota and Honda are already selling tens of thousands of hybrids, and General Motors and Ford, worried about ceding another fast-moving market to the Japanese, have announced plans to join them. The hybrid's rise has been encouraged by pressure from environmentalists and regulators, particularly California rules curbing greenhouse gases and smog-forming pollutants.
2003-01-19	G.M. Primps for Its Return to the Midsize Ball	EAGER to rekindle some of the passenger-car magic it lost long ago, General Motors is conjuring up new automobiles to assault the midsize market it once dominated. The Chevrolet Malibu, a sideshow in recent years, is moving to G.M.'s center ring. Executives fervently hope that an all-new 2004 model will resonate with buyers the way its namesake did in the 1960's and 70's.
2003-01-16	Carmakers Design For Generation Y	The Honda Element looks like a sport utility vehicle that married a Brink's truck, with as much headroom as a Greyhound bus. Inside, Honda calls it a dormitory room on wheels, with seats that can be turned around, pulled out, folded flat, stacked with gear and hosed off. The Toyota Scion xB seems like a time-warped homage to Chrysler's 1980's minivans, shrunken and brought down to curb level. There are no gauges in front of the steering wheel to distract the driver; they are off to the center, above an ear-blasting Pioneer stereo prewired for satellite radio.
2003-01-10	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda's Compact Tops The Corolla	The Fit, a compact car made by the Honda Motor Company, has unseated the Toyota Motor Corporation's Corolla as Japan's most popular car, ending the Corolla's 34-year run at the top of the market. Honda sold 250,790 Fits last year, 24,000 more than the Corolla. Seven of the 10 best-selling cars in Japan were compact models. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-01-08	S.U.V. From Toyota in 2004 To Use Hybrid Technology	Toyota announced today that it would start selling a hybrid version of a small S.U.V., the RX 330 from its Lexus brand, by the end of next year. The Lexus hybrid is likely to be the first luxury auto to use the highly fuel efficient technology and the second such S.U.V. on the market. Hybrids supplement the internal combustion engine with electric power.
2003-01-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Sales Fall	Auto sales in Japan fell to a 16-year low as consumers and companies continue to scale back spending. The country's 11 car and truck makers sold 5.8 million vehicles in 2002, a 2.3 percent decline from the previous year and the fewest since 1986. Sales by the market leader Toyota Motor Corporation fell 2.2 percent, while the Honda Motor Company, the second-largest company, rose 7.9 percent. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-12-28	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Stake In Trade Concern	Toyota Motor will pump 10 billion yen ($83 million) into an ailing trading company, the Tomen Corporation, which will receive an additional 170 billion yen in aid from its main bank, UFJ Holdings. In return, Tomen will eliminate 3,600 jobs, or 40 percent of its work force, and book a one-time loss of 165 billion yen. The moves will help pave the way for a potential merger between Tomen and Toyota Tsusho, another trading company affiliated with Toyota. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-12-24	World Business Briefing | Asia: Indonesia: Carmaker To Raise Financing	The Indonesian carmaker Astra International has won approval from shareholders to raise 1.43 trillion rupiah ($161 million) in a rights issue to help regain its financial footing as part of an $800 million debt restructuring deal reached with its creditors earlier this month. While controlling shareholder Cycle and Carriage of Singapore has agreed to take up its portion of the new shares and even buy shares others do not, fellow shareholder Toyota Motors will allow its 7 percent stake to be diluted down to roughly 5 percent, according to Astra's Finance Director John Slack. Astra has been producing Toyotas in a joint venture with the Japanese carmaker but is negotiating to sell the manufacturing division to Toyota and concentrate instead on distribution and dealerships, Mr. Slack said.

2002-12-11	Hybrid Cars Are Attracting A Broad Range Of Americans	When drivers want to make a statement with their cars, the message typically is about status (BMW), hormones (Mustang), power (Hummer) or speed (Porsche). But the latest car-as-statement is an unornamented Japanese subcompact driven by people who want to poke a finger in the eye of Saddam Hussein, the oil sheiks and the neighbors who jump into gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles for a drive to the grocery store. The car, the Toyota Prius, is the best seller in a small but soon-to-grow category of vehicles known as hybrids that -- by running on a combination of gas and electric power -- get as much as twice the mileage of conventional cars. It has attracted a bipartisan coterie of customers who say they consider it the anti-S.U.V., a car that makes both a political and environmental statement without demanding too many trade-offs.
2002-12-04	Big Three's Auto Sales Fell Sharply in November	Sales at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company fell sharply in November from robust levels a year ago, and stocks of both companies were battered today. Many investors are concerned about the prospect of slumping industry sales next year, which even the automakers are expecting, coupled with increasing competition as foreign carmakers open more plants in the United States and continue to encroach on the lucrative pickup and sport utility market.
2002-11-08	An S.U.V.? Oh, That's So Over!	THE hills around the Vernon Valley in northern New Jersey have curving stretches of graded, tree-lined back roads, and almost no traffic. It was here that Mitch Joseph led a group of other car owners on a Sunday afternoon drive. Mr. Joseph, 38, an electrician from Elizabeth, N.J., likes to explore, looking for hidden roads with what he calls rhythm, and a couple of times a month he shares his discoveries. As the group headed out in a small parade, Mr. Joseph's shimmering gray car led two others built just like it, vehicles anyone who lived through the 1970's would instantly recognize as station wagons. But that's not what their owners call them.
2002-11-08	A Ride That's Old, Rough And Ready	JUST a decade ago, before the sport utility vehicle emerged as a supercharged family supply barge, it was safe to typecast devotees of four-wheel drive as rugged people who preferred the most difficult fork in the road. Four-wheel drive spoke of boulder-strewn mountain switchbacks, rough tracks in the bush, adventurers on safari. As S.U.V.'s have gone soft and mainstream, it's only natural that some drivers seeking to project the old rough-and-ready image are buying the new Hummer H2 S.U.V., with its military swagger. But others are searching out the rugged old models themselves, especially the most glamorous of the old four-wheel drives: vintage Land Rovers and Toyota Land Cruisers.
2002-10-23	Mercedes's Man in Detroit Wants to Give Chrysler Some Import Magic	DURING his first month as Chrysler's chief executive, with the auto company drowning in debt, Dieter Zetsche, newly arrived here from Germany, went to a Costco in search of batteries. Bewildered by the vast choices, he eventually found what he wanted, only to be stymied at the cash register when a clerk asked him for his membership card. A hand reached out behind him and a voice said, ''Here, Dr. Zetsche, you can use my card.'' It turned out to be a Chrysler employee who had recognized him from the company's internal television network.
2002-10-16	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Car Venture Approved	The Chinese government approved a plan by Toyota Motor to build a factory in Tianjin. The plant is Toyota's second in the country and will be used to build cars jointly with the First Automotive Industry Company in China. In the venture, Toyota and First Auto plan to build up to 400,000 cars a year. Toyota started making small cars last week with a subsidiary of First Auto. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-09-22	Automakers Look Beyond Electric	HENRY FORD was a young mechanic at the Detroit Edison Company in 1896 when he had a chance to meet his hero Thomas Edison. ''This young fellow has made some sort of car he runs with gasoline,'' Ford's boss told Edison, according to an account from the 1987 book ''The Fords: An American Epic.'' Ford described to Edison the car and its internal-combustion engine.
2002-08-11	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Toyota Corolla; A Touch of Luxury for Old Reliable	SOONER or later, even the world's most popular car needs a freshening, and when that time comes the makeover artists must consider how they can improve on a class act without altering what made it popular in the first place. That was Toyota's challenge in updating its Corolla, to pick up customers without losing those whose loyalty it had already won. The Corolla, which is the second-best selling Toyota in the United States to the Camry, is sold in 142 countries. But no automaker can have continued success if people buy only its low-profit small cars. Toyota realized this long ago, and it has nurtured a strong brand loyalty that has Corolla owners moving up to Camrys and Lexuses.
2002-08-08	Luxury Car Sales in U.S. Lift Earnings At Toyota	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that its profit more than doubled in the first fiscal quarter as a result of strong demand for its luxury models, a weak yen and strong dollar, and a one-time gain from its pension fund. The company's outlook for the rest of the year, however, is clouded by slow sales at home, a stronger currency and signs of a slowdown in consumer spending in the American market, where Japanese manufacturers earn about three-quarters of their profits.
2002-07-02	TOYOTA TO START LEASING S.U.V.'S POWERED BY FUEL CELLS	The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that it would start leasing 20 sport utility vehicles powered by fuel cells to the private sector by the end of the year. Fuel cells are hydrogen-powered energy sources that the auto industry regards as environmentally friendly replacements for the internal combustion engine, though cars powered by fuel cells are not expected to be widely available for at least a decade. Toyota would be the first to offer such vehicles in any capacity. The Honda Motor Company plans to make some available next year, and all the other major automakers are developing their own. John Hanson, a Toyota spokesman, said half the vehicles would be versions of the company's Highlanger sport utility vehicle and would be available to businesses in California, where the company has set up hydrogen fueling stations. The other half will be available in Japan, he said. Danny Hakim (NYT)
2002-06-14	G.M. Beat Ford in Efficiency, A Study of Auto Plants Finds	Last year, for the first time since a closely watched study began tracking productivity, General Motors was more efficient than the Ford Motor Company in building cars. But both companies, along with DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, continue to trail Asian competitors in productivity and profitability. The gap remains wide, even though the three major Asian automakers -- Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan -- slipped a bit last year.
2002-06-14	World Business Briefing | Australia: Australia: Steel Strike Ends	BHP Billiton Ltd. said a 24-day strike at its Western Port factory ended, allowing its steel unit to resume supplies to customers including the automakers, Toyota, Ford Motor and Mitsubishi. The strike had curbed steel output at the BHP Steel plant and threatened to stop production at Australia's four biggest automakers. BHP Steel said it and the three unions involved reached a labor agreement without providing further details. BHP employs 1,380 people at its Western Port plant.
2002-06-02	Private Sector; A Hip Toyota, by His Design	THE first time Craig Kember saw a Toyota Matrix on the street was a couple of months ago, on his lunch break. ''It felt awesome,'' he said. ''I could recognize it from, like, half a mile away. It's something I worked on a while ago, and all of a sudden it's on the road.''
2002-05-31	G.M. Rises and Nissan Falls in J.D. Power Quality Survey	General Motors rose to third place in this year's quality ranking surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, the best performance for a domestic manufacturer since the study's methodology was changed in 1998. The Ford Motor Company also rose in the closely watched initial quality survey, which examines how cars perform in their first 90 days, as did DaimlerChrysler, the parent of the Chrysler Group. Ford moved from seventh place to fifth in the survey. DaimlerChrysler moved from fifth to fourth.
2002-05-29	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: More Autos Built	Japan's five largest automakers increased production at their plants overseas last month to meet growing demand in North America and elsewhere and to take advantage of lower costs. The Toyota Motor Corporation, the country's largest carmaker, increased production overseas by 37 percent in April, while Nissan raised output 23 percent. The Honda Motor Company, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and the Mazda Motor Corporation also raised production. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-05-14	Good Times For Toyota, But It Faces More Rivalry	Is Toyota Motor peaking? The results the company announced today for the year ended March 31 certainly scale new heights, with record sales, operating profit and net income reported, despite a slowing of growth after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The company's forecast for the year that began April 1 is for more smashed records.
2002-05-02	Auto Sales Increased 2.9% in April; Only Ford Lagged	Every major automaker except Ford Motor reported sales increases last month, evidence of an economic recovery that helped propel the stock market today. Over all, automobile sales in the United States rose 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
2002-04-17	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Toyota Parts Expansion	The Toyota Motor Corporation said it planned to invest 3.6 billion rupees (73.5 million) in two auto parts manufacturing units to build transmission systems. The two plants will be near Bangalore in southern India, and are expected to be operating by June 2004, the company said. The plants, which will produce 160,000 transmission systems a year, will be set up by a joint venture of Toyota and its subsidiaries. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2002-03-27	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Exports Jump	Leading automakers increased their exports to North America last month. Exports were helped by a weak yen, the introduction of several new models and the economic recovery in the United States. Toyota Motor shipped 21.8 percent more cars to the United States, while exports by Nissan Motor rose 23.9 percent. Exports by Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda rose even faster. But domestic auto sales slipped for most companies. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-03-24	The Cars That Car Designers Like to Look at	IF you want to rub elbows with automobile designers, there's no place like a car show to see the men and women who shaped the look and feel of the car in your driveway. But what do the designers themselves look at when they stroll the exhibition hall? The New York International Auto Show opens to the public on Friday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Earlier in the week, industry movers and shakers (and more than a few designers) will be on hand to unveil their latest dream cars (and real cars) to the press.
2002-03-22	Will the magic of E.T. work again? Several marketers tie in to the movie's rerelease.	IF marketing executives in 1982 could have foreseen that ''E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial'' would become one of the 10 highest-grossing movies, they would have done then what they are doing now -- lining up to attach their brands to the blockbuster. As Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment prepare to rerelease the film at theaters nationwide on its 20th anniversary today, several companies have nudged their way onto the ''E.T.'' bandwagon. Each is betting that the digitally enhanced version of the movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, will be as successful at selling products as it will be at selling tickets.
2002-03-10	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe; Dealers to Make Way for Toyota Jr.	THERE, in the corner of the Toyota dealership, is it the Fountain of Youth? Toyota is making a concerted effort to attract younger buyers on two continents by establishing two new nameplates and setting aside special areas within dealerships intended to appeal to 20-somethings. It will also continue to seek new ways, including the Internet, to market cars and trucks. In the United States, the company has announced plans to create a new line of less expensive vehicles aimed at buyers who are just now reaching their 20's. Instead of Toyota badges, these vehicles will carry a new name: Scion. Toyota dealers will sell Scions, too -- in contrast to the separate franchises Toyota established for Lexus.
2002-02-26	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Production Rises	Japan's largest automakers increased production and exports in January to meet demand in the United States. Toyota Motor, the market leader, increased worldwide production by 4.6 percent, while global output at Honda Motor was up by 7.4 percent. Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda Motor also had gains. Japanese carmakers have benefited from the zero interest financing campaigns introduced by their rivals in the United States. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-02-17	Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Toyota	IN the cafeteria, there are sticky rice and hush puppies, soy sauce and ketchup, chopsticks and forks. This is Toyota, bluegrass style.
2002-01-04	Incentives Prop Up Sales but May Haunt Carmakers Later	Auto sales, propelled by low-cost financing, finished the year slightly below a record set in 2000, according to data released today. But expectations for 2002 are pessimistic because of the economy as well as the dent that the incentives have probably made in demand. Carmakers ended 2001 with sales of about 17.1 million vehicles, down slightly from the record 17.3 million in sales a year earlier. Few analysts expected such a strong performance last summer, when industry sales were lagging, and the Sept. 11 attacks all but halted showroom traffic.
2001-12-27	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Output Down	Four of Japan's five largest automakers reduced production in November as sales at home and in many export markets dried up. Toyota Motor, the world's third-largest carmaker, cut global production 4.6 percent, while Nissan Motor, Japan's No. 3 automaker, trimmed output 3.1 percent. Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda cut production more than 10 percent each. Only Honda Motor, helped by demand for its subcompacts and minivans in Japan, increased output. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-12-21	World Business Briefing | Europe: Czech Republic: Car Plant Planned	The Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan and PSA Peugeot Citroën of France said yesterday that they would build a 1.5 billion euro ($1.4 billion) plant for a new range of subcompact cars in the Czech city of Kolin, about 40 miles east of Prague. In a 50-50 venture, Peugeot will oversee purchasing and logistics, while Toyota will handle development and production of the new 1.0-liter, low-emission car. The car will be aimed at Europeans who usually buy used cars. The plant will employ 2,000 people and produce up to 300,000 cars a year, Peugeot said. All three of the companies' brands, Peugeot, Citroën and Toyota, will offer different body styles on the same mechanical platform. Peter S. Green (NYT)
2001-12-20	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Automakers Expect Small Sales Gain	The Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor, Japan's two largest automakers, expect small gains in global sales in 2002. Toyota, which holds more than 40 percent of the Japanese market, expects sales to rise 2 percent when including the subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino. Exports are expected to fall 10 percent, but Toyota will offset the decline by increasing output at its plants overseas by 16 percent. Honda, meanwhile, expects global sales to rise 6 percent in 2002. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-11-26	All-Terrain Zealotry	Dismayed by its status as the Taliban's favorite automaker, Toyota today rolled out a new line of S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks for 2002. Named ''Northern Alliance'' after the Afghan rebels, the new vehicles are specifically designed, according to a Toyota spokesman, ''for today's all-terrain freedom fighter.'' Over the past years, Toyota has grown increasingly uncomfortable with images of Taliban soldiers driving around in its pickups with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles or leaping out of its S.U.V.'s to beat women. The new Northern Alliance line includes not only features designed to appeal to anti-Taliban forces, but also a number of devices that make the cars unappealing to brutal zealots.
2001-11-09	Toyota Bucks the Economy And Posts Record Earnings	It's a good time to be a company that sells cars for dollars and counts its profits in yen. While American carmakers struggle with losses, Toyota's profits are booming. Today the company reported the largest half-year profit in its history: $2.4 billion for the period ended Sept. 30, up 82 percent from the period a year ago. Strong sales in the United States, cost-cutting and favorable movements in exchange rates were responsible, the company said. It even raised its full-year profit forecast, something hardly any Japanese company has done lately.
2001-11-09	Major Clients Award Big Accounts to 2 Shops	Major advertisers are making decisions on large accounts. Toyota Motor Sales USA selected the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, 49 percent owned by the Publicis Groupe, as its first agency of record to create advertising aimed at black consumers.
2001-10-26	Not Now. I'm Fighting With My Car.	FIRST, Sony gave the world a robot, Aibo, that thought it was a dog. Now, the company has teamed with Toyota to make a conceptual car that's part pet and part nag. Called the Pod, it has moving eyelids over its headlights, a light-bar mouth that communicates by changing colors and an antenna that protrudes like a tail. Using sensors and an electronic memory, it responds and adapts to the driver.
2001-10-03	Auto Sales Off in September, But Less Than Expected	United States auto sales slumped last month, but were better than analysts expected. A drought in auto sales after the attacks has already led to additional belt-tightening for an industry that was trimming as the economy worsened. Now, analysts say demand will plunge more sharply, leading to more production cuts, plant closings and layoffs.
2001-09-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Toyota Shares Tumble	Shares of the Toyota Motor Corporation slid 6.1 percent on reports that it would lower its sales target for 2001 because of weaker sales in Japan. The company denied the report but predicted rough times ahead. ''Our sales will not be as good as expected, but we're not changing our forecasts,'' said Tetsu Kitagawa, a spokesman for the company. Toyota Motor passed NTT DoCoMo as Japan's largest company, but has lost 24.6 percent of its market value since the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11. The slide comes even though Toyota spent $474 million buying its own shares. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-09-05	Detroit's Big Three May Shuffle as Chrysler Struggles	General Motors. Ford. Toyota? The overseas assault on Detroit's Big Three continued yesterday as the Chrysler Group reported that its August sales fell 24 percent from the year-earlier period. That surprised analysts and led some to wonder if the continuing sales gains by Toyota Motor would lead it to become the nation's third-largest automaker, vaulting past Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
2001-09-05	World Business Briefing | Asia: Malaysia: Stake In Carmaker	The Daihatsu Motor Company, a unit of the Toyota Motor Corporation, and Mitsui & Company, agreed to buy a controlling stake in Malaysia's second-largest carmaker to help expand small-car production in Southeast Asia. UMW Holdings Bhd., MBM Resources Bhd. and other shareholders of Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Nasional Sdn., or Perodua, will set up a company for the carmaking units, and then sell 51 percent of it to the Japanese companies, UMW said. Daihatsu already owns 20 percent of Perodua.
2001-08-28	Most Japan Carmakers Report Gains in Global Production	Toyota Motor and Honda Motor led gains in global production among Japanese automakers in July as they raced to meet demand for new models at home and in the United States. Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, said global production rose 4.4 percent, to 439,020 vehicles, in July from July of last year.
2001-08-28	Toyota puts music at the center of a big cross-media campaign built around the 2002 Camry.	THEY say music hath charms to soothe a savage breast, but hath it charms to stimulate additional sales in a cloudy economic climate for an already popular automobile? That's the $160 million question being posed by Toyota Motor Sales USA and its agency, Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, as they ready what they are calling the largest campaign in the 43 years Toyota has been in the American market. The campaign -- involving artists as diverse as Lyle Lovett; Earth, Wind and Fire; John Lennon; and the Go-Gos -- will peddle the 2002 version of the Camry, the bread-and-butter Toyota midsize sedan that has been the nation's top-selling passenger car for the last four years.
2001-08-10	Toyota Earmarks $8 Billion for Diversification Efforts	Threatened with a boycott backed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Toyota said today that it would commit nearly $8 billion over the next decade to diversify its work force and reach out to more minority suppliers and customers. The United States affiliate of the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan said that it would spend millions more with black and Hispanic advertising agencies, work to expand the number of minority dealerships, create new career training programs for minorities and invest capital with minority-owned asset management companies.
2001-07-13	World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Joint Auto Venture	Two automakers, Toyota Motor of Japan and PSA Peugeot Citroën of France have formed a joint venture to develop and build a compact car in Europe, the companies said. At a news conference in Brussels, Fujio Cho, president of Toyota, and Jean-Martin Folz, left, chief executive of Peugeot, said the 1.5 billion euro ($1.3 billion) project would produce 300,000 vehicles a year. Two-thirds of them will have the Peugeot nameplate and the rest Toyota. Miki Tanikawa (NYT)
2001-07-06	Canada Vote May Bring First Union to Japan Carmaker	Only last month, J. D. Power & Associates named the Toyota plant here the best car factory in North America -- for the fourth time. The Harbour Report, by another industry consultant, ranked it the continent's most efficient producer of subcompact cars. On Friday, the factory takes a step toward earning one more distinction, when its workers vote on whether to join the Canadian Auto Workers union. If the union wins, it will mark the first time that a Japanese-owned auto plant in North America has been unionized, not counting factories that began as joint ventures with American-based companies.
2001-06-30	Toyota and Peugeot in Pact To Produce Car for Europe	Toyota Motor of Japan and PSA Peugeot Citroën of France announced today that they would jointly develop and build a small fuel-efficient car for the European market. The companies said they expected to sign a formal agreement in July and announce details then.
2001-06-13	Toyota to Introduce Another Hybrid Engine	Hoping to expand on the modest success of its Prius hybrid gas-electric car, Toyota Motor announced a new hybrid engine system today that it said was simpler, cheaper and more versatile, though not as stingy with fuel. As with the Prius, the new engine combines gasoline and electric power. Compared with a conventional engine, Toyota said, the new engine reduces fuel consumption by 15 percent and emissions by half.
2001-05-24	Some Hybrid Vehicles Are Here; Their Tax Status Remains Vague	Last Thursday, Vice President Dick Cheney released an energy plan that recommended a $2,000 tax credit for hybrid vehicles, which mix gasoline and battery power. In theory, this was new. But it puzzled Bob Zubritsky, who had walked into a showroom in Morristown, N.J., the Saturday before and ordered a Toyota Prius, one of the two hybrids now on the market. The salesman gave him Internal Revenue Service Form 8834, ''Qualified Electric Vehicle Credit,'' which provides for a tax credit up to $4,000 for automobiles ''powered primarily by an electric motor.''
2001-05-17	Toyota's Net Surges 16% Despite Slowing Economies	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that its earnings rose 16 percent in the year ended March 31, as strong sales and aggressive cost-cutting helped the company overcome the impact of slowing economies in its main markets. Toyota, the world's third-largest automaker, easily surpassed its Japanese rivals, reporting earnings of 471 billion yen ($3.8 billion) -- the highest annual profit in the company's history -- compared with 407 billion yen ($3.3 billion) the previous year. Sales rose 4.2 percent, to 13.4 trillion yen ($108 billion). The results exceeded analysts' forecasts.
2001-05-11	Toyota to Create Mexican Unit; Building a Factory May Be Next	The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that it was creating a sales unit for Mexico, the only North American market where it does not build or sell cars and trucks. Analysts said the move would most likely lead to a factory in Mexico. Toyota has four assembly plants in the United States and Canada.
2001-05-02	Auto Sales Were Down Last Month	Auto sales fell in April, providing the first important indicator of the economy's condition early in the second quarter and a sign that weakening consumer confidence is beginning to affect spending on high-price products. The auto industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.6 million vehicles, down 10 percent from a year earlier. Sales in April were a little higher than what the auto industry considers to be the long-term demand for new automobiles but below the annual rate of 17.2 million cars and light trucks in the first quarter.
2001-04-29	More Than Cars, Not Quite Trucks (but Toyotas to the Core); Sitting Comfortably in a Hot Spot	TOYOTA did not become a global powerhouse by making risky bets. It carefully analyzed other companies' successful cars and trucks, refined their designs, built them better and replaced them faster. So it was notable that this conservative company rolled the dice in 1996 with a small sport utility vehicle, the RAV4, that was built not like a truck, as S.U.V.'s generally had been, but like a car. And two years later, it seemed to take an even bigger gamble with the Lexus RX 300, a luxury utility that similarly defied characterization. Based on the Toyota Camry, the RX was largely a car under the skin. But it could be ordered with all-wheel drive, and it was more upright than a conventional station wagon, putting drivers in the high position that many -- especially women -- liked in sport utilities. The styling had S.U.V. overtones, although the sheet metal was wrapped around a plush cabin.
2001-04-29	More Than Cars, Not Quite Trucks (but Toyotas to the Core); RAV4: Even Grown, It Earns Grins	BEFORE there was a Ford Escape or Hyundai Santa Fe, before the Suzuki Vitara or Chevrolet Tracker, even before there was a Subaru Forester or Honda CR-V, there was the Toyota RAV4. It was among the first of the small, perky, youth-oriented vehicles called cute utes. Five years since the RAV4 made its debut, an extensively redesigned model is out. Toyota has significantly beefed up its small sport utility, which is now less of a toy and more of a truly useful utility vehicle.
2001-04-17	Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Accept 2 Cases to Clarify Protection for Disabled	Eleven years after taking effect, the Americans With Disabilities Act is providing a steady flow of Supreme Court cases, and important questions about its meaning and operation remain unresolved. The court took a step today toward answering a some major questions by accepting two cases for decisions in its next term. Both are appeals by employers, one on a basic question of how to define disability and the other on the obligation of employers to accommodate disabled workers when the proposed accommodation conflicts with the rights of other workers under a valid seniority system.
2001-02-02	Using Shock To Peddle The Goods	Talk about shock advertising. The 30-second spot opens with a 50-something heart attack victim lying on a hospital bed, eyes closed. As perky orchestral music plays in the background, two electric paddles are applied to his bare chest. He grunts, jolted, as a charge is applied.
2001-01-04	Vehicle Sales Fell Sharply In December	Auto sales slowed precipitously last month, with domestic automakers reporting plunges of up to 18 percent from year-ago levels. Foreign automakers, though, escaped almost unscathed and gained market share. Ward's Automotive, an industry data service, calculated that overall sales fell 7.6 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million cars and light trucks.
2000-12-18	In Japan, an Established Company Is Transformed	Akio Toyoda is Japan's Willliam Clay Ford Jr. Widely regarded as the heir to the throne at the Toyota Motor Corporation by virtue of both his bloodlines and his experience, he seems well on his way to taking over one of Japan's most distinguished and financially sound companies. But Mr. Toyoda has chosen a somewhat unorthodox means of proving himself: he has set out to demonstrate that even a bastion of the economic old guard known as Japan Inc. can make waves in the new economy.
2000-12-02	TOYOTA MAY MARKET FORDS	The Ford Motor Company is in talks with the Toyota Motor Corporation to sell Ford vehicles through Toyota dealers in Japan, an executive of Ford's Japanese subsidiary said. Ford said such a move would not undermine the Mazda Motor Corporation, which Ford controls, because Mazda dealers alone cannot handle all the demand for Ford cars.
2000-11-19	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Prius; It's Easier to Be Green	TOYOTA executives describe their Prius as a ''real car.'' While that might sound like damning a product with faint praise, it is actually a compliment for an alternative vehicle. And they are right. The Prius, a so-called hybrid that uses both gasoline and electric power, avoids most of the drawbacks and inconveniences of other vehicles that are designed to be clean and fuel-efficient. Its emissions are among the lowest of any car on the road, and its fuel economy -- 48 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving -- is second only to that of the Honda Insight, another hybrid.
2000-11-16	Toyota Reports 20.9% Earnings Drop	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that its half-year profit fell 20.9 percent from the period a year earlier, to 159.6 billion yen ($1.48 billion), as the strong yen offset the effect of growing sales. Aggregate profits for the six months through September 30 were also suppressed by the cost of covering shortfalls in the company's reserves for pensions.
2000-11-12	Babes in the Woods: Putting 5 'Cute Utes' to the Test	SMALL sport utility vehicles are grabbing an ever-bigger chunk of the car market, and the hottest ones are cars at heart. They are designed like cars, with one-piece unit bodies, instead of like trucks, with separate bodies bolted to rugged frames. And they meld some car characteristics -- comfortable cabins, relatively responsive handling, compliant rides, reasonable fuel economy -- with the traits that have had people lining up for S.U.V.'s: good outward visibility, a ''commanding'' driving position, flexible cargo space and the bad-weather security of all-wheel drive. At prices in the low $20,000 range, these perky S.U.V.'s -- ''cute utes,'' in industry parlance -- are bargains compared with luxurious crossover vehicles like the $36,000 Lexus RX 300 and the $50,000 BMW X5.
2000-11-12	No Recount: Escape Wins	PLAYING musical driver's seats attunes one to a vehicle's personality, strengths and quirks. Solid and substantial, the Santa Fe exceeded my expectations. The much-improved RAV4 is impressive in many ways. But the Escape was the standout, striking a fine balance between fun and utility and capably handling every road, trail or track maneuver. 1. FORD ESCAPE -- Its V-6 was peppy, its transmission was smooth, its handling was quick and sharp, its steering was precise and linear -- no wonder the Escape felt best on-road or off. On the test track, it was the least likely to come unglued.
2000-11-12	Power and Poise Put Ford on Top	THREE years ago, when I had a chance to directly compare small sport utilities, they were easy to rank: Subaru Forester first, Honda CR-V second and Toyota RAV4 third. There are more players now, and they are better -- but harder to choose among. 1. FORD ESCAPE -- With an independent rear suspension and rack-and-pinion steering, the Escape handled accurately and predictably, and it rode well. On loose, washboard surfaces, it refused to skitter or skate. Although a four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission are standard, we drove a fancier XLT with a V-6 and four-speed automatic, which upshifted smoothly, downshifted quickly and didn't hunt for gears on hills. The economy rating is only 18 m.p.g. in town, but the Escape can tow 3,500 pounds -- by far the most in this group.
2000-11-02	U.S. Auto Sales Sag, Another Slowdown Sign	Not even aggressive discounting by automakers could lift sales of new cars and light trucks last month, and bloated inventories of unsold models have led to the closing for a week of 8 of the nation's 55 auto assembly plants. Auto sales are the first important economic indicator to come out at the beginning of each month, and today's results were another sign that growth in the American economy has been slowing somewhat recently. Although sales have leveled off at a high level by historical standards, they are increasingly being sustained by ever more generous rebates and low-rate loans, rather than by strong consumer demand.
2000-10-24	The Race Begins to Build a Small Car for China	General Motors said today that it would begin producing a small car in China in December, the first of several such offerings planned by some of the world's largest automakers, each hoping to dominate this country's potentially huge market. Based on the Opel Corsa that G.M. makes in Brazil, the car will be sold under the Buick brand and will be called the Sail in English, a transliteration of its Chinese name, Sai Ou, which means roughly ''compete with Europe.'' General Motors' China operations expect to face competition from European as well as American and Japanese manufacturers after China joins the World Trade Organization and car import duties fall.
2000-10-05	Toyota Distributors Name West Wayne	The Southeast Toyota Distributors L.L.C., representing 25 local Toyota dealer groups in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, has consolidated its account by naming West Wayne in Atlanta as its new agency of record. Billings were estimated at $70 million.
2000-09-23	TOYOTA EXPECTS STRONGER RESULTS	Japan's leading automaker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, said yesterday that it was likely to report higher earnings for the first half of its fiscal year than it had anticipated as sales were stronger than expected in North America and Europe. Toyota raised its profit forecast by 43 percent, to 100 billion yen, or nearly $1 billion, for the six months ending in September. It will probably sell 10,000 more cars domestically and 60,000 more for export to North America and Europe than it originally expected. Miki Tanikawa
2000-09-13	TOYOTA PLANTS SHUT	The Toyota Motor Corporation said it would temporarily close 13 auto assembly factories in central Japan because rain storms from a typhoon had disrupted delivery of auto parts. Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, halted production at factories in the Nagoya area for about a day, a move that will affect production of about 17,000 vehicles. The storm has created logistics problems for Toyota, which relies on ''just in time'' deliveries of auto parts.
2000-08-29	Bridgestone Asks Venezuelan Dealers to Return Some Tires	Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced this evening that it had asked its dealers in Venezuela to return unsold 15- and 16-inch light truck tires made there, but the company rebuffed the Ford Motor Company's request for a recall of identical tires already in use in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. In May, Ford recalled its Ford Explorer and F-series pickup trucks equipped with the tires in all three countries, and the automaker said today that it had urged Bridgestone to recall other manufacturers' sport utility vehicles that use the same tires. Ford also scheduled a news conference on Tuesday in Caracas, Venezuela, to explain why the automaker thought that tire-related crashes of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela had solely been a result of defective tires and not because of any excessive tendency of Explorers to roll over.
2000-08-19	Toyota Raises 5 Models' Prices	The American unit of the Toyota Motor Corporation raised prices today on 2001 year models of two sport utility vehicles and three cars. The largest increase was on the Land Cruiser sport utility vehicle -- up $1,167, or 2.3 percent, to $52,895, from this year's model. Excluding the cost of features that had been optional and are now standard, the increase was $422, or 0.8 percent, the company said. The price rises came as Toyota sales in this country through July increased by 12 percent from the period a year earlier and its market share rose to 9 percent from 8.4 percent, according to the Autodata Corporation.
2000-08-06	Learning to Predict Allergy Season	STUDENTS from two Westchester high schools headed back to school last month to do research on weather and pollen, hoping to forecast the duration and intensity of next year's allergy season. Supported by a $10,000 grant from Toyota, 14 students from Lakeland High School in Shrub Oak, which has a popular weather club, and nine students from Fox Lane High School in Bedford, where students have been recording pollen counts, spent five days at Fox Lane learning how to read weather maps, take pollen counts and do long-range forecasting.
2000-08-04	TOYOTA DISAGREES WITH ORDER CONFIRMATION BY G.M.	The Toyota Motor Corporation said General Motors was premature in announcing that Toyota would use G.M.'s OnStar communications system in its vehicles. Toyota is in discussions with G.M. to use OnStar on ''a few new models'' but no agreement has been signed, Toyota said in a statement. OnStar, a G.M. subsidiary, uses global-positioning technology and wireless communications to allow owners to track a stolen vehicle, call for roadside help or gain access to navigation information. On Monday, Ford Motor introduced a competing service with Qualcomm Inc. Nissan has said it will use Ford's service in its Infiniti luxury vehicles.
2000-08-02	Car Sales Rise, Except at G.M. And Chrysler	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said today that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories. Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force in the American economy during July.
2000-07-07	HONDA ON TOP IN JAPAN	Claiming in June to have Japan's top-selling car for the first time, thanks to its remodeled Odyssey minivan, the Honda Motor Company displaced the Toyota Motor Corporation, which has led sales for more than a decade. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker overall, sold 14,639 Odyssey vans in June, 450 more than Toyota's subcompact Vitz, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Toyota commands more than 40 percent of Japanese-made sales. The remodeled Odyssey was introduced in December, and sales in Japan have since reached about 70,000.
2000-06-29	Ford and Toyota Test the Sale of Cars Online in Canada	Canada has become a laboratory for the automobile industry's experiment with selling cars to consumers over the Internet. The Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor and Toyota Motor have established test Web sites to let consumers in three regions of the country log onto the Internet to buy vehicles -- tests that could foreshadow the parent companies' global strategies.
2000-06-25	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota MR2 Spyder; Hugging the Lonesome Highway	TO drive the new Toyota MR2 Spyder is to appreciate the Mazda MX-5 Miata all over again. For more than a decade, an eternity for a sports car, the plucky little Mazda roadster has defined the road-going romantic idyll. The Miata is small, even intimate, with a trunk that can handle a couple's bags for a romantic weekend getaway. Leave the golf clubs at home; you're going no farther than the hot tub. The Miata is also a terrific little open-top sports car, with whip-smart handling, excellent balance and an eager, high-revving engine. For a generation of older-but-wiser fans of British sports cars, the affordable Miata delivered all the windblown pleasures of the old MG's and Triumphs without fear of being becalmed by mechanical failures.
2000-06-01	CANADIAN AUTO SUBSIDIES	A World Trade Organization appeals panel has upheld a ruling against Canada's laws on importing automotive products. It affirmed a decision last fall that a 1965 Canada-United States auto pact violated free trade rules by giving subsidies to American manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors. Toyota Canada issued a statement urging the Canadian government to lower duties for all manufacturers or force American automakers to repay the ''illegal subsidies they have received over the past few years.'' Elizabeth Olson
2000-05-23	Toyota Plans to Join Buying Exchange	The Toyota Motor Corporation has told the General Motors Corporation that it will join the Internet exchange being formed by G.M. and other vehicle manufacturers to cut purchasing costs. Meetings are being held this week between representatives of the exchange, called Covisint, and Toyota, said David Barnas, a spokesman for G.M. Toyota would be the sixth automaker to participate.
2000-05-18	Despite Yen, Half-Year Income Is Up 25% at Toyota	The Toyota Motor Corporation reported surprisingly strong financial results for the second half of its fiscal year today, helped by robust sales in North America and Japan and cost-cutting that partly offset the effects of a strong yen on profits made overseas. Toyota's earnings climbed 25 percent to 205.1 billion yen, or $1.9 billion at current exchange rates, in the last six months of the fiscal year that ended on March 31, compared with earnings of 163.5 billion yen in the corresponding period a year earlier.
2000-05-17	Cruiserheads, and the Big, Bare Bruisers They Love	SOME vehicles beget cultlike followings: the Toyota Land Cruiser, for example. To a generation of explorers, adventurers, mercenaries and photojournalists -- real and would-be -- this is the object of their desire. Not the curvy, comfortable and expensive models of the last decade, but the heavy, ungraceful, boxy bruisers imported to the United States between 1958 and 1990. These were vehicles built to last, to be driven over rough terrain and repaired by nonmechanics in the outback. You can abuse these war horses. You can equip them with strong roof racks, grille guards, side bars, big tires, auxiliary lighting and the ultimate badge of off-road intent, winches front and back. Then, you can gather at some ''Cruiserhead'' oasis -- the Moab desert in Utah is popular right now -- and put your machinery to the test, stopping only to rest a front tire on a boulder while you swap stories about who got stuck, how badly and where.
2000-05-07	In a Search for Hot Wheels, Buyers Hit a Dead End	AS Robert Forester watched his dealer pull up in a black Chrysler PT Cruiser to take him for a test drive, he decided on the spot that the retro-looking small van would join his family's fleet. ''I got in that PT Cruiser and fell in love,'' said Mr. Forester, who works for a printing and stationery business in Henderson, Tex., 150 miles east of Dallas.
2000-05-03	Auto Sales Keep to Torrid Pace Even as Loan Costs Rise	Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American economy by now, especially the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet the stampede into the showrooms continues across the country, with every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing today that sales last month exceeded even last year's brisk pace. The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge, indigo blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. Interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he wrote a check for the entire cost of the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the proceeds from stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by the high price of gasoline.
2000-04-04	Robust Sales Push U.S. Auto Industry to Its Best Quarter Ever	Americans bought new cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles at a sizzling pace last month, closing out the best quarter ever for the auto industry as the nation's economy appeared to be following up a winter of brisk economic growth with a springtime of continued strong expansion. Ford Motor said today that its sales in the United States leaped 7.2 percent from a year earlier to the highest level ever for a single month. Four other big automakers had their best March ever: DaimlerChrysler, up 4.4 percent from last year; Toyota, up 16 percent; Honda, up 20.3 percent; and Mitsubishi, up 25.4 percent.
2000-03-26	DaimlerChrysler Nears Deal To Buy 33.4% of Mitsubishi	In another big move toward the global consolidation of the automobile industry, DaimlerChrysler of Germany is to announce a deal tomorrow to acquire 33.4 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors for about $1.3 billion, people close to the companies said yesterday. The deal would make DaimlerChrysler the world's third-largest automaker, behind General Motors and Ford. All three will now have large shares of the three main markets: Western Europe, Japan and the United States. The other giants of the auto industry, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and the Renault-Nissan alliance, still are weak in at least one of these markets.
2000-03-23	Gentlemen, Merge Your Manufacturers; Consolidation Hits on Virtually All Cylinders	The consolidation of the global auto industry has reached a full-throttle roar as automakers around the world respond to the changing economics of the business. The list of companies partly or entirely acquired by other manufacturers in the last two years was impressive even before the frenzy of the last two weeks: Chrysler, Volvo Cars, Nissan, Saab, Fuji Heavy Industries, Suzuki, Daihatsu, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Since the beginning of last week, General Motors has agreed to buy a fifth of Fiat; Ford Motor has agreed to buy Land Rover from BMW; and DaimlerChrysler has moved close to taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Daewoo and Samsung are both up for sale in Korea, with deals likely later this year.
2000-03-12	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Celica; A Look So Very Now. (Is It Old Yet?)	ANY doubts I had about the design of the new Toyota Celica were erased when I pulled into the lot of the local car wash. One look at the red, serpent-headed sport coupe sent the rag-wielding workers into a frenzy worthy of the early hominids in ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'' Uh-oh. The Celica has a problem.
2000-03-02	Auto Sales in February Near Monthly Record	The United States auto industry is poised to have its second-best month for sales ever after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported higher vehicle sales for February today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining companies report sales on Thursday. That would put February sales in second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million vehicles.
2000-02-02	Newest and Trendiest Autos Bring Americans to Dealers	Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles available, automakers said today, as every manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced big gains in sales. The three increases of a quarter percentage point each in short-term interest rates last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on the torrid pace in the auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that the industry this year would nearly match the record-setting pace of 1999.
2000-01-22	As Thefts Fall, New Yorkers Find Car Where They Left It	It has not been the cars that have been vanishing lately in New York City. It has been the thieves. During the last decade, as crime declined throughout the city, none of the major felonies tracked by the Police Department -- not murder, not rape, not robbery and not assault -- fell as sharply as auto theft.
2000-01-01	Detroit Plays Catch-Up In Race for Hybrid Car; With Fewer Subsidies, Japan Is Ahead	With hundreds of millions of dollars of private and federal research work behind it, the General Motors Precept, an experimental model to be introduced here on Jan. 9, is probably the most expensive single car ever built. Yet it is still a lot of car for the money. In place of side-view mirrors, which cause a lot of wind resistance, it has tiny cameras, mounted on the front doors, that send images to the dashboard. Rather than the smooth, rounded contours commonly associated with aerodynamic design, carefully angled body panels are designed to give the six-passenger Precept far less wind resistance than a Corvette sports car. And instead of a gasoline engine, the car has two electric motors, batteries under the seats and a rear diesel engine to charge the batteries and provide additional power and range.
1999-12-29	Toyota to Increase Prices	The Toyota Motor Corporation, the No. 4 automaker in the United States, plans to raise prices on its 2000 model Toyota and Lexus luxury cars and trucks to take advantage of record demand. The automaker, which is based in Japan, said it would increase average retail prices on Toyota vehicles by 0.8 percent, or $175, starting Feb. 1. Lexus prices will climb 1.2 percent, or $454. The move follows a 1.9 percent increase on Toyotas announced in August. Toyota's American depositary receipts rose $7.625, to a 52-week high of $96.875. The company's United States sales in the first 11 months of the year rose 10.7 percent, to 1.35 million vehicles, a rate that outpaced the five largest United States automakers. Industrywide, United States sales this month broke the 1986 record of 16.03 million.
1999-12-18	TOYOTA SHARES SOAR	The shares of Japan's largest automaker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, posted their biggest one-day gain in 11 years on optimism that increased investments in telecommunications would help the company develop new car-navigation technology. The DDI Corporation, Japan's second-largest long-distance telephone company, said on Thursday that it would buy the KDD Corporation and the IDO Corporation for more than 2.7 trillion yen ($26 billion) in stock and assumed debt. Toyota, which already owns stakes in both carriers, will be the second-largest shareholder in the new company.
1999-12-02	G.M. and DaimlerChrysler Report Weak Monthly Sales	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler announced November sales figures today that were weaker than expected as American automakers continued to lose market share to Japanese rivals, who posted big gains. G.M. said its sales in the United States inched up just one-tenth of a percent last month compared with figures in the period a year earlier, several percentage points worse than expected, while DaimlerChrysler said its sales fell 1.3 percent last month, marginally worse than expected. But Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and particularly Nissan Motor all reported large increases, while sales for Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled.
1999-11-28	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2000 Toyota Echo; An Odd Lesson in College Economics	AFTER pulling me over at 1:30 a.m. on a recent Thursday, Trooper Antone Wilson of the Massachusetts State Police offered an enthusiastic, Bostonian ''How ah yah?'' followed by a more pointed question: ''Is this car gas or electric?'' The new-for-2000 Toyota Echo had caught the eye of Trooper Wilson as I drove down Commonwealth Avenue. He had stopped me to discuss the car's merits.
1999-11-03	Foreign Nameplate Autos Are Sales Favorites in U.S.	Buyers snapped up cars and trucks with foreign nameplates last month, forsaking some of their past favorites -- American-made sport utility vehicles. Nearly every foreign brand reporting sales results today showed increases, and many notched double-digit gains. Toyota sales rose 12.6 percent in October compared to the same period a year ago. Honda sales rose 3.2 percent and Nissan jumped 27.6 percent.
1999-10-02	Auto Makers Finish Record Year on Strong Note	Customers drawn by hefty rebates bought more than 16 million new cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in the 1999 model year, breaking the sales record set in 1986. ''These are good times,'' said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president for sales, service and marketing for the General Motors Corporation, which had its best model-year results in a decade. ''The combination of affordable vehicles, high employment and buying momentum continues to propel us to record levels.''
1999-10-01	AUTOS ON FRIDAY /Technology; Looking Under the Hood of a Hybrid Honda	HONDA and Toyota started with the same concept, an automobile powered by both an internal-combustion engine and an electric motor, and each company will begin shipping such hybrid cars to dealers in a few months, the first of what environmentalists hope will be a flood of innovative cars from companies around the world. But the two Japanese companies that will be the first to market have assembled similar ingredients into products as different as a potato chip is from a French fry. The Honda Insight will be in showrooms by December, the first mass-produced hybrids offered for sale in this country. Two-seaters vaguely reminiscent of the Honda CRX, which went out of production in 1992, they will have an E.P.A. fuel economy rating of more than 70 miles a gallon, the company said, and will sell for less than $20,000, including amenities like keyless entry and power windows (although with only a manual transmission, at least for now). With a range of 600 to 700 miles on a 10.4-gallon tank of plain old unleaded gasoline, they avoid the electric car's dilemma of where to recharge and then, after 100 miles or so, where to recharge again, and then again.
1999-09-30	Detroit Silent As a Toyota Hits Market	Despite the soaring value of the yen, the Toyota Motor Corporation introduced a subcompact car today that will be imported from Japan and will be priced well below comparable models made by Detroit auto makers. Not long ago, such a move would probably have outraged American auto executives, prompting them to call for Federal investigations into whether Japanese cars were being dumped on the United States market. But there was silence today from the industry in Detroit, which has become increasingly global.
1999-09-15	It's a Hybrid In Sport Utility Clothes; A Car-Based Light Truck, It Obeys the Fuel Rules, and It Helps Make Money	Scheduled to go on sale next spring, the Chrysler PT Cruiser is not quite a sport utility vehicle and not really a minivan. It does not look like a conventional car, either, although it uses much the same underbody and even a few of the same parts as the Dodge Neon, which is definitely a car.
1999-09-11	TOYOTA TO BUILD IN POLAND	The Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's third-biggest car maker, will invest 10 billion yen, or $92 million, in a car parts plant in Poland, its first factory in Eastern Europe, Toyota's president, Fujio Cho, said. Mr. Cho and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek of Poland had signed an agreement under which Toyota would employ about 300 people to produce 250,000 gearboxes a year for its Avensis, Corolla and Yaris models. It will be Toyota's fourth European plant, after a car assembly and engine plant in Britain and an assembly plant now being built in France.
1999-09-08	Toyota Set to List Shares in U.S. and Britain	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would list shares on the New York and London stock exchanges on Sept. 29 to increase investor awareness in the company. Toyota also said three of its biggest shareholders would sell 162.9 billion yen ($1.5 billion) worth of stock to help generate interest in the new listings.
1999-09-02	Auto Sales Rose Sharply In August	In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced today that their sales soared in August, with the biggest growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the highest profits. DaimlerChrysler A.G. said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States with a 2.8 percent increase.
1999-07-29	Account Decisions By 3 Marketers	Three advertisers have made decisions involving big accounts. The Toyota Motor Corporation expanded its relationship with Ammirati Puris Lintas, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering in Brussels awarded the agency's Paris office what were called central creative communications duties; the intent is to assure that Toyota's brand image is consistent across Europe. Billings were not disclosed.
1999-07-13	U.S. Lawsuit Faults Toyota On Pollution Warning Lights	The Federal Government sued Toyota today, accusing it of violating the Clean Air Act by selling 2.2 million automobiles on which the ''check engine'' light would not illuminate even when the vehicles were emitting excessive pollution. The lawsuit, which theoretically could involve penalties of as much as $60 billion, came after Toyota rejected an offer to settle the case out of court. It is the latest in a series of similar disputes pitting the Government against auto makers and truck makers. In each case, the Government has contended that the vehicles' computer diagnostic equipment had been programmed to meet Federal standards during laboratory tests, but not during actual driving on the road.
1999-07-08	Toyota Is Seeking to Stop Use of Seniority to Set Pay	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest car maker, is negotiating with its union to eliminate seniority as a major factor in determining the salaries of white-collar workers. If the company is successful, it may influence the pay practices of companies across Japan, particularly because Hiroshi Okuda, Toyota's chairman, is also chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations.
1999-06-16	TOYOTA PREFERS CHINA	The Toyota Motor Corporation announced in Shanghai that it could start producing cars with the Tianjin Automotive Industry Company by 2001, anticipating a rise in private car ownership in China. Atsushi Sakamoto, Toyota's representative in Beijing, said the venture would produce 30,000 Toyota Corollas with 1.3-liter engines in its first year. Separately, a Toyota official based in Europe said the company had abandoned a plan to open a truck assembly plant in Russia because of economic and political instability there.
1999-06-10	Cable and Wireless Wins Fight for Japan Phone Carrier	Japan's first hostile takeover battle pitting a foreign suitor against a domestic corporate titan ended in victory today for the outsider, Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain, which gained enough support to guarantee it majority control of International Digital Communications, a struggling telephone carrier. International Digital's two largest shareholders, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Itochu Corporation, said today that they would sell their 17.7 percent stakes to Cable and Wireless, after the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, one of the bluest of Japanese blue-chip companies, said that it would not sweeten its bid for the smaller carrier.
1999-05-25	TOYOTA PROFITS TUMBLE	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest car maker, reported a 21.6 percent decline in profits for the year that ended March 31, despite more robust sales. The results partly reflected the company's increased stakes in the mobile telephone operator, the IDO Corporation, and the Daihatsu Motor Company, which were not included last year. Profits fell to 356.1 billion yen ($2.8 billion), from 454.3 billion yen a year earlier. Sales rose 9.2 percent, to 12.7 trillion yen. Toyota said it hoped to proceed with the long-awaited listing of its shares on the New York and London stock exchanges in the second half of this year. Stephanie Strom (NYT)
1999-05-19	Where to Put the Golf Clubs? Right Next to the Hydrogen!	THE two small cars that rolled up to the State Capitol in Sacramento did not seem much different from other cars -- until you saw the hydrogen tanks in their trunks. The vehicles, one by DaimlerChrysler and the other by Ford, were propelled by fuel cells, which are nonpolluting and are seen by many experts as the technology that will replace the gasoline-burning internal-combustion engine. The event in Sacramento last month marked a milestone. Ford and DaimlerChrysler, along with the State of California, announced that the auto makers would test up to 50 of their new vehicles over the next few years, a sign that fuel cells are stepping out of the laboratory and onto the road.
1999-05-04	Several Big Auto Makers Posted Robust April Sales	In a further sign of consumers' willingness to keep spending in a robust economy, auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April. The Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., Toyota, Honda and Nissan, along with a number of smaller auto makers, reported strong sales today, and the industry as a whole is on track to match or beat its vigorous sales pace of last April.
1999-05-02	It's the Extras That Count	VIRTUALLY every manufacturer has minivan ergonomics down pat. After all, functionality, comfort and convenience are the reasons people drive these mobile dens. So other factors now count: Four doors have become essential for convenience (and for children's safety on one-way streets). Power-operated sliding doors win extra credit. I also appreciate extra horsepower and nimble, car-like handling. Clever ideas, like well-placed storage nets and power outlets, are a big plus.
1999-05-02	Rating Vans: Who Has the Best Family Room for the Road?	CHRYSLER created the modern minivan, and for 15 years it has successfully fended off the arrows of a pack of challengers. But the rivals keep coming with ever more potent weapons, including new vans this year from Ford and Honda (on the heels of improved competition from General Motors and Toyota). But just as van makers figured out what customers want in a family vehicle -- from extra doors to cup holders to secondary music sources with headphone jacks -- the market has cooled. Although sales have picked up nicely this year, they remain below their 1994 peak, and rebates and discounts are common. Sport utility vehicles are one reason, and rebellion against the vans' soccer-mom image is another.
1999-05-02	From Skeptic To Admirer	I HAD not cared much for minivans, preferring the handling of even a station wagon over these boxes on wheels. Then I took a family trip in a Plymouth Grand Voyager, hauled home a Christmas tree on the roof of a Toyota Sienna and took some Cub Scouts camping in a Ford Windstar.
1999-04-14	Toyota Picks Aide to Founding Family as President	The Toyota Motor Corporation ended months of speculation today about who would succeed Hiroshi Okuda as its president, appointing a close aide of the Japanese auto maker's founding family to replace him. Mr. Okuda's successor, Fujio Cho, is known for his ties to the company's founding Toyoda family, whose corporate influence is far out of proportion to the tiny percentage of shares it still owns.
1999-03-31	Requiem for the Middleweights; Ho-Hum Taurus Marks End of Midsize Sedan as Style's Pace Car	Remember the first Ford Taurus? When the car was introduced in late 1985, its smooth, aerodynamic curves shook up the design of midsize sedans. And despite fears that its radical look would turn off car buyers, sales took off almost immediately. Moreover, its success was one of the early signs of the resurgence of the Ford Motor Company, which today is at the brink of surpassing the General Motors Corporation as the largest auto maker in the world. Well, Ford just unveiled the new Taurus yesterday at the New York International Auto Show. But do not look for any surprises. While it may sell well if it is priced cheaply enough, it is unlikely to win any contests for style. Indeed, the most distinctive thing about the new Taurus is probably how indistinguishable it is from all the other lookalike midsize sedans.
1999-03-17	Reduced Pay Increase Reported at Toyota	The Toyota Motor Corporation has agreed with its union to raise salaries by an average of 7,600 yen ($64) a month starting in April, the financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported yesterday.
1999-02-03	Car Makers Get Strong Start To 1999 Sales	Ford, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota and other auto makers sold new family vehicles at a blistering pace in January, a sign that the American economy's torrid growth in the fourth quarter is carrying over into the new year. With gasoline prices continuing to fall, sales of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans soared in January, rising 19 percent at DaimlerChrysler A.G. from a year earlier, 20 percent at the Ford Motor Company and 32 percent at the Toyota Motor Corporation. But car sales were also brisk after months of weakness, with DaimlerChrysler and Toyota reporting large increases while Ford's car sales dropped only because of a reduction in unprofitable car sales to rental agencies.
1999-01-26	Youth Move at Toyota	To attract young car buyers, the Toyota Motor Corporation is now considering a new brand name for its sporty cars and trucks for the Japanese market, a Toyota executive said today. Some of Toyota's recently released cars, such as the Progres sedan and the Altezza sports coupe, already do not carry the company's symbol -- an effort, analysts say, to disassociate them from the Toyota name, which generally stands for reliability and conservatism but not for sportiness. Also today, Toyota said it planned to buy back up to 12 million of its own shares, or less than 1 percent, for 38 billion yen, or about $332 million, and cancel them.
1999-01-13	9 Auto Makers Form Coalition	Nine auto makers announced today that they had formed a new trade association. The members of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers are the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation of the United States; BMW A.G., Volkswagen A.G. and DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany; A.B. Volvo of Sweden, and the Mazda Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan.
1999-01-11	Toyota President Is Choice to Lead Trade Group	In a development that surprised corporate Japan, the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations made clear its intention late Friday to elect Hiroshi Okuda, the dynamic president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, as its new chairman. Toyota moved quickly to say that Mr. Okuda would continue to have a significant role in its operations. ''He should not retire from the company management,'' Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota's chairman, said on Saturday, according to the Kyodo News Service. ''We need him.''
1999-01-07	Auto Industry Finds Surprises At the End of a Rainbow Year	Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from which the General Motors Corporation has not fully recovered. With the last auto makers reporting their results today, the industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase from 1997.
1998-12-25	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; Toyota Seeks a Cozy Spot in Europe	RECESSIONS are chilling Japan and much of the developing world, but it's springtime in Europe for the Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyota has invested heavily here in this decade, and its planning is about to pay off. When European Union quotas on Japanese imports end in 12 months, Toyota will be ready with new models, expanded factories, more dealers and its high-margin Lexus luxury brand. Globally, Toyota is No. 3, after the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. Its weakest region has been Western Europe, where it had less than 3 percent of the market in 1997. But this year it passed Nissan to become the biggest Japanese auto company in Europe, and by 2005 it plans to nearly double European sales to 800,000 units. That will make it bigger in Europe than Citroen and nearly as large as the BMW Group, including Rover.
1998-12-19	Toyota Rules Out Bailout Of Troubled Affiliate Bank	The Toyota Motor Corporation will not give financial help to an allied company, Sakura Bank Ltd., the auto maker's president said this week. Sakura Bank had turned to Toyota for support earlier this year, hoping it would provide funds to prop up the bank's capital as it writes off bad loans. Some investors had been concerned that Toyota would use its shareholders' money to participate in a bailout of Sakura, which along with the car maker is part of a keiretsu, a loose group of allied companies, clustered around the trading giant Mitsui & Company.
1998-12-18	The Electric Home-Drive Acid Test	TEST-DRIVE an electric car, and at first the sensation of quiet overwhelms all else -- except, perhaps, the anxiety about how much energy remains in the batteries. But drive an electric for a few days and subtle characteristics start to become obvious, such as the way the door over the fueling port locks (so no one can siphon your electricity?) or the realization that roads have sounds other than cars -- bird songs, for instance. And electric cars are great for sneaking up on pedestrians.
1998-11-23	Saatchi to Handle New Toyota Account	The Toyota Motor Corporation has expanded its relationship with the Saatchi & Saatchi unit of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. by naming the agency's London office to handle the European introduction of a small car to be called Yaris. Billings were estimated at $100 million.
1998-11-20	Toyota's Other Businesses; As Company Branches Out, Investors Spin Their Tires	For years, investors have nagged the Toyota Motor Corporation to put its huge pile of cash -- some $20 billion at last count -- to work. But now that the company has taken a hammer to its piggy bank, those same investors are questioning the way some of the money is being spent.
1998-11-08	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Acura 3.2TL; The Luxuries Add Up, Except on the Sticker	HONDA -- more to the point, Acura, Honda's luxury-sport division -- has a problem. While the company's smaller cars, everything from the Honda Civic and Accord to the Acura Integra and NSX, are class beaters, its offerings in the hot ''entry level'' luxury market have been greeted with yawns. The now-forgotten Vigor struck few customers as superior to the less expensive Accord. And the 2.5TL that replaced the Vigor proved to be an overpriced, underpowered bore. What to do? Acura stuck by the TL name, but transformed the car into a slick performer -- a worthy rival to the $30,000-plus sport sedans from Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volvo, Infiniti, Lexus and many others. Moreover, on the assumption that half-measures would not be adequate to redeem the brand, Acura priced the new American-made 3.2TL -- last year's models, the 2.5TL and 3.2TL, were imported -- several thousand dollars below comparably equipped competitors from Europe and Japan.
1998-11-04	Chrysler Sales in October Increased 20% Over a Year Ago	The Chrysler Corporation reported today that its October car and truck sales rose 20 percent over a year ago, indicating yet another strong month for vehicle sales industrywide despite waning consumer confidence. Chrysler sold 226,179 cars and trucks this October. Its percentage increase over the corresponding period last year is significantly larger than that of many other auto makers because of a particularly weak October last fall. At that time, Chrysler was in the process of introducing some critical new products and its plants were not making those new vehicles at expected capacity.
1998-10-18	Black Belt in Market Share Becomes the Goal at Toyota	IN the three years he has been president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, Hiroshi Okuda has become known as much for his black belt in judo as for his outspoken views and aggressive moves to revitalize the once very conservative automobile maker that the stock market values as Japan's largest publicly traded company. His efforts come at an especially trying time for Toyota. The Japanese domestic market, which it dominates, is mired in a long downturn, and the company's most important overseas market, the United States, is showing signs of stalling.
1998-10-11	Cars, Very New and Very Old; Freeport Test Drives Electric Car	THE Toyota RAV-4 parked at the curb of Freeport Village Hall looks like an ordinary sport utility vehicle. But under its hood, there is no transmission, carburetor or pistons, but two dozen 12-volt batteries. The electric vehicle is on loan from the New York Power Authority to Freeport, the only municipality on Long Island to begin a monthlong test of the vehicle. C. D. Rappelyea, the Chairman and Chief Executive of the New York Power Authority, who gave the keys to the silver RAV-4 to Mayor William F. Glacken of Freeport at a press conference at Village Hall, said lending the sport utility to Freeport was part of the state's efforts to promote clean-fuel cars and reduce the level of environmental pollutants.
1998-10-04	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1999 Lexus LX 470 and 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser; One Ready for the Woods; The Other, the Country Club	DID conspicuous consumption disappear with the 1980's? Not where large, expensive sport utilities are concerned. It seems that the bigger and more expensive the luxury sport utility, the better it sells. Consider the Toyota Land Cruiser and its virtually identical cousin, the Lexus LX 470. Both of these full-sized sport utilities, priced from almost $47,000 to almost $59,000, were redesigned for the 1998 model year and introduced in April. They are unchanged for the 1999 model year.
1998-10-01	Data Venture By Toyota And Sony	Two of Japan's mightiest companies are teaming up with a relative unknown to develop a business service that provides data transmission, perhaps challenging the domain of another Japanese corporate titan. The Sony Corporation, maker of some of the most popular consumer electronics and movies, and the Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest auto maker, have reached an agreement with Internet Initiatives Japan, to create a company that will offer Japanese businesses a cheaper way of sending data over telephone lines than is currently available.
1998-09-03	S.& P. Gives Top Rating To Toyota Bond Issue	The Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit-rating agency, gave a AAA rating yesterday to a 50 billion yen ($350 million) bond issue by the Toyota Motor Corporation. The show of confidence comes despite the fact that a rival rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, cut Toyota's rating to Aa1 earlier this month, citing weak car demand in Asia.
1998-08-29	Toyota to Raise Its Stake in Mini-Vehicle Maker	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would raise its stake in the Daihatsu Motor Company to 51.2 percent from 34.5 percent, spending 37.1 billion yen, or $259 million, to cement control of the company, which is Japan's second-largest producer of mini-vehicles. The planned purchase is the latest in a spate of mergers and acquisitions in the world's auto industry. Toyota said that ''fierce global competition'' was behind its decision to buy the 71.45 million Daihatsu shares.
1998-07-26	BEHIND THE WHEEL/General Motors EV1, Toyota RAV4-EV, Honda EV Plus; Charge! Doing an Electric Commute	A TURTLE icon suddenly lit up on the dashboard of my Toyota RAV4 Electric Vehicle. The car's batteries were exhausted and I had entered ''limp home mode,'' which would allow me to putter along at a reduced speed for a few miles to make it back to a charger. But instead of slowing down, the car stalled completely on a dark street a mile from my home. Panicked, I jumped out, pushed the car to the side of the road and began scrounging for coins to call a tow truck.
1998-06-17	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Japan's New 'Temp' Workers; Rethinking Lifetime Jobs and Their Underpinnings	This spring, Suguru Takamatsu, one of 814 new employees of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, took his destiny into his own hands. Mr. Takamatsu, 25, declined to join the ranks of the Japanese salarymen who rarely think about financing their retirement until their employer hands them a fat check at the age of 60. Instead, he elected to have his retirement benefits, along with other perks the company would normally provide over the course of his career, paid to him directly as he advances at Matsushita.
1998-05-21	Toyota Reports Record 1997 Earnings	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's biggest auto maker, said today that it had a 17.7 percent gain in earnings for its 1997 fiscal year, reaching a record, as strong sales in the United States and Europe offset weakness in Asia. Earnings totaled 454.35 billion yen, or about $3.3 billion, in the year that ended on March 31, compared with 385.9 billion yen the year before. Revenue fell 4.6 percent, to 11.68 trillion yen, or about $85 billion.
1998-05-09	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Japan's Auto Makers Go It Alone; Tradition Creates Resistance to Industry's Consolidation	Standing inside the dormitory he manages for the Nissan Motor Company, Mutsumi Goto looked a bit befuddled by the whirlwind on the other side of the world. ''It's an epoch-making event and I feel a little bit left behind,'' he said.
1998-05-08	Mergers Help Fuel a Two-Tier Global Auto Hierarchy	The global auto industry is increasingly divided into two tiers, as a half-dozen giant companies prosper while many of their smaller rivals struggle to manage heavy debts or afford the ever-rising cost of designing new cars. With the pending completion of today's acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G., each of the world's three major auto-producing regions will have two successful, global auto makers. Toyota and Honda are thriving in Japan. General Motors and Ford are enjoying record profits in the United States. Volkswagen and the new DaimlerChrysler, which will have German and American executives but will be dominated by European shareholders, will be the strongest auto makers based in Europe.
1998-03-04	Chrysler Sales Increased 3.1% in February	The Chrysler Corporation reported today that domestic car and truck sales rose 3.1 percent in February, beating estimates, with a surge in truck sales offsetting a sharp drop in car sales. Over all, sales for Chrysler, the third-largest American auto maker, rose to 200,068 from 193,983 a year earlier. Car sales fell 9.1 percent, to 64,506, while truck sales increased 10 percent, to 135,563.
1998-01-08	Camry Holds Off Accord For Title of Best-Selling Car	After a race to the wire, the Toyota Camry beat the Honda Accord for the title of the nation's best-selling car in 1997, leaving the Ford Taurus in third place and ending its five-year reign as the top seller. Strong sales in December for Toyota, Honda and the General Motors Corporation left the auto industry as a whole with better-than-expected sales for the year. Auto makers sold 15.2 million vehicles in the United States last year, up from 15.1 million vehicles sold in 1996.
1998-01-03	Camry and Accord Race for Sales Title	The biggest car race of the year was held on dealer lots in December. Who won? It's anyone's guess. With the last sales figures about to trickle in, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord were neck and neck, both vying for the title of the year's best-selling car. Ford's Taurus, a five-time champion, has been demoted to third place.
1997-12-05	Honda Is No. 2 in Japan	For the first time in its 49-year history, the Honda Motor Company can claim to be Japan's second-largest auto maker after the Toyota Motor Corporation. Last month, Honda overtook the Nissan Motor Company to sell more vehicles in Japan. Honda sold 74,706 autos in its domestic market in November, 4.3 percent more than Nissan's 71,593 units, according to figures released today.
1997-11-30	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Sienna; Substituting for a Subpar Player	MY son's soccer game was over, and I was loading the 1998 Toyota Sienna with sports equipment and lawn chairs when the parents of another player approached for a closer inspection. The Toyota badge had captured their attention. They were currently driving a Plymouth Voyager, and they were unhappy with a spate of minor defects in that mini-van, having previously driven Japanese cars of nearly impeccable quality. But since they had recently been transferred to Detroit, they felt obligated to ''buy American,'' they said. And frankly, the imported mini-vans they had looked at were neither as roomy nor as cleverly designed as they would have liked.
1997-11-07	Despite Sluggish Sales, Toyota Earnings Rise	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that earnings rose in the fiscal first half as cost cuts, growing exports to the United States and Europe, and the weaker yen made up for slack sales in Japan. The auto maker's vice chairman, Iwao Isomura, said there was no sign that Japanese consumers' appetite for cars had begun to rebound. ''I'm annoyed,'' he said. ''Conditions are ripe for a recovery in demand, yet sales remain so sluggish.''
1997-10-26	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Prizm; A Pair of Sensible Shoes for the Road	AFTER I pulled up to the public library and locked the doors of the 1998 Toyota Corolla I was test-driving, a friend approached to ask how I liked the car. She has run up 120,000 miles on her 1990 Geo Prizm, the Corolla's twin, with her commute from the suburbs to downtown Detroit. I gave her a rundown on the new Corolla's virtues, but she was not ready to replace the well-used car that has served her nicely. ''I just got new brakes, so I'd like to get another 60,000 miles out of it,'' she concluded.
1997-10-02	Chrysler, After Sales Plunge, Is Hopeful on New Models	All year long, the Chrysler Corporation has watched its sales lag behind last year's record levels, and in September its disappointment deepened. So far this year, Chrysler sales were down 7.1 percent. The company said today that its sales dropped 14.1 percent last month, with car sales down 14.4 percent and sales of mini-vans, Jeeps and pickup trucks down a surprising 13.9 percent.
1997-10-01	Republic and Toyota Reach Settlement	Republic Industries reached a settlement with the Toyota Motor Corporation today that clears the way for Republic to quickly add Japanese car dealerships to its chain of new-car showrooms. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
1997-10-01	Sony and Toyota Plan Liquid Crystal Venture	The Sony Corporation and an affiliate of the Toyota Motor Corporation will spend 50 billion yen ($413 million) to build a plant to make liquid-crystal-display panels using a new technology that is less expensive than current methods. The 50-50 venture, to be called the ST Liquid Crystal Display Corporation, will help Sony and Toyota break into a growing market.
1997-08-30	Buick Bringing Its Rivals to the Showroom Floor	It sounds like a cruel challenge: Why not put Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords in Buick dealerships and see whether dealers can persuade people to buy the Buicks anyway? Even executives at Buick's parent company, the General Motors Corporation, thought the idea was a joke at first. After all, Camrys and Accords are synonymous with high quality and reliability to the generation of buyers who normally would not be caught dead in a Buick showroom. To baby boomers, Buicks are synonymous with mushy steering, velour-covered bench seats and room for six.
1997-08-22	Fight Over Car Dealerships Takes a Turn for the Nasty	Dishing dirt has turned into throwing mud in the very public spat between the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company on the one hand and H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries on the other. In the latest round, Republic staged a news conference yesterday in New York at which 23 former state attorneys general it had hired concurred that Toyota and Honda had no right to block Republic's attempts to buy car dealerships.
1997-08-20	Toyota Said to Have Plan to Bolster Profit	The Toyota Motor Corporation plans to almost double its profitability by early next decade by eliminating less-lucrative models in Japan and increasing the efficiency of its overseas plants, The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday. Toyota plans to raise operating profit as a percentage of consolidated sales to 9 percent by early in the next decade from 5.4 percent in the year ended March 31, Keith Truelove, a company spokesman, said.
1997-08-13	Huizenga, Toyota and the Perils of Lawsuits	A vicious legal fight between H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries and two Japanese auto makers is proving that few problems can be as deadly to a stock as the uncertainty created by big lawsuits. Republic's stock closed today at $23.4375, having lost nearly half its value since reaching a high of $42.75 on Jan. 23. This precipitous drop in a rising market is particularly serious for Republic, which has an expansion strategy of using its stock to buy up other businesses.
1997-08-05	Toyota Will Build Auto Plant in India	The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that it would build a $170 million plant in India, where the $3-billion-a-year auto market is dominated by the Suzuki Motor Corporation. The factory -- a joint venture with the Kirloskar group of India -- will start production at the end of 1999 and have an annual capacity of about 50,000 vehicles similar to mini-vans, Toyota said.
1997-07-25	Toyota Ahead of Pack On Hybrid Production	While many auto makers are working on electric vehicles and on hybrids that can run on multiple energy sources, the Toyota Motor Corporation seems most likely to become the first manufacturer to mass-produce a hybrid that delivers twice the fuel economy and one-tenth the emissions of a conventional automobile. Toyota is planning to introduce its hybrid, a car sized between a compact Corolla and mid-size Camry, by the end of this year in Japan.
1997-07-02	Chrysler Sales Were Off 4% in June, Less, Though, Than Expected	The Chrysler Corporation reported a 4 percent sales drop for June today, its fifth straight monthly decline, but demand for its pickup trucks and mini-vans was so strong that the overall decline was less than Wall Street analysts had feared. Compared with June 1996, Chrysler's car sales dropped 14.8 percent last month, while sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and Jeeps rose 2.5 percent, setting a monthly record. So far, June looks to be a slow month for auto sales generally. Toyota reported a 2.3 percent drop in sales today compared with a year earlier, though Honda sales rose 8.9 percent and Nissan was up 2.4 percent. Most smaller manufacturers fared poorly. Total sales for the 12 producers reporting today were down 2.3 percent.
1997-06-08	Convertibles in Contrast, From Paseo to Diablo	CHALK it up to global warming, or to a collective midlife crisis as baby boomers enter their 50's. Or credit the auto industry with improvements that make these fair-weather friends reasonably agreeable even in the driven snow. Whatever the reasons, convertibles are having a renaissance.
1997-05-22	Stronger Models, Weaker Yen Help Lift Toyota Income 50%	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that group net income rose 50 percent in the latest fiscal year, driven by a strong model lineup, windfall profits from the weaker yen and cost reductions. The results fell short of analysts' expectations, however, and the auto maker noted that earnings growth was curbed by the costs of promoting cars in Japan and building more plants overseas. Toyota, Japan's biggest car company, added capacity in the United States, Britain, Canada and Thailand.
1997-05-09	Toyota Plans to Offer Compact Car in Europe	The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that it was planning to introduce an entry-level compact car in the European market as part of its strategy to expand local operations and sales in Europe. A spokeswoman for the Japanese auto giant said that the new model would be built at its planned second auto-assembly plant in Europe, which will start operating in the beginning of the next century.
1997-05-02	Sales for G.M. And Chrysler Fell in April	The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation said today that their car and truck sales cooled off last month, even as Japanese auto makers, benefiting from favorable exchange rates, reported stronger sales. G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, said that its sales in the United States dropped 5.2 percent last month from the corresponding period a year earlier, while Chrysler said its sales fell 11.5 percent. By contrast, the eight Japanese auto makers reporting April sales today saw their sales rise a combined 2.0 percent.
1997-05-02	General Motors gambles on a do-or-die strategy to reinvigorate the Oldsmobile marque.	EVERYONE agrees it is a tough assignment. The Leo Burnett Company is charged with wooing Honda and Toyota buyers to Oldsmobile, best known for building stodgy sedans driven by grandparents.
1997-04-25	Toyota Plans Another Buyback	The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday it would buy back another 100 billion yen, or $793 million, of its shares and raise its dividend. Under that program, Toyota has bought back 25.83 million shares at a cost of 75 billion yen. The number of Toyota shares outstanding at the end of 1996 was 3.774 billion.

1997-04-04	Vehicle Sales In March Highest In Eight Years	Despite a decline at the Ford Motor Company, March car and truck sales were the strongest in at least eight years, getting the spring selling season off to a robust start. Ford, the last of the Big Three American auto makers to report, said today that its sales fell 2.6 percent in March from a year earlier, when its sales were strong. But over all, cars and trucks were whisked out of dealerships at the brisk, seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.8 million vehicles in March. Auto makers sold 1.4 million vehicles last month, up 1.5 percent from the corresponding period a year ago, when sales were also strong.
1997-03-31	No to Hybrid Car, And Yes to Electric	To the Editor: Re ''Toyota to Sell Hybrid-Power Car in Japan'' (Business Day, March 26):
1997-03-27	MOTOROLA WINS $1.5 BILLION CELLULAR CONTRACT	Motorola Inc. has won a contract said by analysts to be worth $1.5 billion or more to supply cellular phone equipment to the DDI Corporation and Nippon Idou Tsushin, an affiliate of the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two companies are building a nationwide wireless network in Japan, which is the world's fastest-growing cellular market. The contract gives a big lift to the code-division multiple-access technology that Motorola will use. The technology was developed by Qualcomm Inc. Motorola's shares climbed $2.1875, to $60.5625. Shares of Qualcomm rose $1.75, to $61.25, and shares of the DSC Communications Corporation, which will provide switches and software for the networks, rose 50 cents, to $23.
1997-03-26	Toyota to Sell Hybrid-Power Car in Japan	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would become the first company to sell a low-polluting hybrid vehicle, with both an electric motor and a gasoline engine, to a mass market. The company, the largest Japanese auto maker, said it would begin selling a compact hybrid car with a 1.5-liter engine in Japan this year. Executives said they had no immediate plans to sell the vehicles in the United States, though that is a possibility later. ''We are very confident about what this offers,'' said Akihiro Wada, an executive vice president of Toyota, ''but we would like to get reaction and criticism by testing it in the Japanese market first.''
1997-02-08	Toyota Output Hurt By Fire at Supplier	The Toyota Motor Corporation's production will fall behind by 50,000 vehicles after a fire at a parts supplier last week forced the closing of two plants, the vice chairman, Iwao Isomura, said yesterday. The company said it expected to resume normal production by Monday. It is not clear yet whether Toyota can make up the lost production by the end of the year, he said.
1997-02-05	Ford's Sales Increase 2.8%, While Toyota's Soar 55%	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales rose 2.8 percent in January from a year ago, while Toyota said its sales jumped 55.5 percent. The final tally of sales figures showed that in January, American auto makers lost ground to their Japanese and European competitors. Over all, auto sales rose 6.3 percent last month, with car sales up 8.3 percent and truck sales up 3.8 percent.
1997-02-04	January Car Sales Up 2.3%; Foreign Makers Have Surge	Foreign auto makers showed the biggest sales gains in the American auto market last month as the strong dollar continued to help them offer generous lease deals and low prices. Among the nine auto makers reporting January results today, sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago. Foreign auto makers reporting results today saw their combined sales rise 10.9 percent, while the combined sales of the two American auto makers reporting results today dropped a tenth of 1 percent.
1997-01-30	Toyota Repurchases 5.7 Million More Shares	Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that it had bought back 5.7 million of its shares for 18.10 billion yen ($149.9 million) on the Tokyo market from Dec. 26 to Jan. 28.
1996-12-20	Look, Up in the Air, It May Be a Toyota	Will Toyota's next model have wings? The Toyota Motor Corporation is considering entering the aircraft engine business and possibly making small planes as well, Hiroshi Okuda, its president, said today. But he also said there was no firm plan to do so.
1996-12-05	Ford Reports Vehicle Sales Dropped 2.2% in November	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales fell 2.2 percent in November, as the final tally of monthly auto sales showed that American companies had lost ground to Japanese and European competitors. The Big Three American auto makers built 72.1 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the United States in November, down sharply -- three percentage points -- from the levels during November 1995. Foreign auto makers, especially Honda and Toyota, gained market share given up by American companies, particularly the General Motors Corporation. G.M.'s market share dipped below 30 percent for the third month this year, analysts said.
1996-11-22	For Both Car Makers and Consumers, a New Sales Factor	''I want to be loved by you, just you,'' Marilyn Monroe croons seductively, as a mini-van smashes into a wall. Another accident caused by a driver daydreaming? No, this is a Japanese television commercial for the Toyota Motor Corporation, advertising its new love affair with safety: the mini-van test crash, Toyota says, shows that its car bodies protect passengers.
1996-11-09	For Japan's Auto Makers, Windfall From Yen	A sharp fall in the value of the yen in the last year has been providing an earnings windfall to Japan's major automobile companies. Owing largely to currency fluctuations, the Toyota Motor Corporation reported today that net income for the first half of its fiscal year more than quadrupled as automobile exports surged. The Nissan Motor Company, meanwhile, recorded a first-half profit for the first time in five years.
1996-11-02	G.M. Car Sales Drop as Other Makers Report Increases	The General Motors Corporation reported today that its car and truck sales dropped 7.9 percent last month from a year earlier, even as Chrysler, Honda and Toyota all announced their highest October sales ever. Wall Street analysts said that it was hard to figure out why G.M.'s sales were weak. G.M. had strong car sales in October 1995; still, the 24 percent drop in car sales, to 215,276, was larger than expected. G.M.'s sales of pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 22.1 percent, to 182,661, but analysts said the gain compared with weak sales last year, when a trucking company strike slowed deliveries of these light trucks.
1996-10-12	Impact of Canadian Strike Extends Beyond G.M.	Toyota Corollas that are assembled in North America use a part manufactured at a General Motors factory in Canada that is now on strike, showing the increasing vulnerability of auto makers to labor walkouts as they buy more parts from each other. The General Motors Corporation sent a flat-bed truck with a police escort several times today to a factory in Oshawa, Ontario, to try to remove the die used to stamp seat brackets for the Toyota Motor Corporation cars, said James A. Nimigon, the strike captain at the factory. Mr. Nimigon said that the police had asked him to order the picketers to move aside and let the truck through the factory's north gate, and that he had refused.
1996-09-05	G.M. Says Its Vehicle Sales Slipped 7.9% in August	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales last month dropped 7.9 percent from the strong levels of a year ago, partly because of weak demand for large sedans and luxury cars, and partly because dealers did not have an adequate supply of trucks to sell. Sales of G.M. cars plunged 13.8 percent in August, while sales of the company's mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose a slight 2.1 percent. Of G.M.'s eight divisions, only Chevrolet and Saab, the car maker it owns jointly with Investor A.B., reported higher sales.
1996-09-04	Chrysler Sales Increased by 9% in August	The Chrysler Corporation said today that its sales last month rose 9 percent over its strong sales in the comparable period a year earlier. Although car sales were weak, Chrysler's sales of light trucks -- mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks -- were especially strong. Car sales fell 4 percent in August, but truck sales shot up 17 percent, continuing at the blistering pace they have set all year. So far this year, Chrysler's car sales have risen 5 percent, while truck sales have jumped 19 percent.
1996-08-21	Irvin Sued by Car Dealers He Endorsed	Another speed bump developed yesterday in MICHAEL IRVIN's year of living dangerously. Alleging that the Dallas Cowboys wide receiver had misrepresented his ''image and reputation,'' a consortium of North Texas Toyota dealers sued Irvin and his agents for damages they claim to have suffered as a result of Irvin's recent cocaine-possession trial.
1996-08-20	Japan's Micro-Machine Project Draws Envy and Criticism	JAPANESE companies made their mark in the world automobile industry with the compact car. Now they are hoping the ''micro-car'' will position them as leaders of one of the most promising industries of the future. As tiny as a grain of rice, the micro-car is a replica, at one one-thousandth the size, of the Toyota Motor Corporation's first automobile, the 1936 Model AA sedan. The minuscule vehicle has 24 parts, including tires, wheels, axles, headlights and taillights, and hubcaps that carry the company name inscribed in microscopic letters. The motor, which is itself made of five parts, is only 0.7 millimeters in diameter and can propel the car at speeds of up to 5 centimeters, or about 2 inches, per second.
1996-08-08	Move by Toyota Reported Into Japanese Chip Market	An affiliate of the Toyota Motor Corporation is planning a major expansion into the Japanese semiconductor business through a joint venture with Texas Instruments, Japan's leading business newspaper reported today. Toyoda Automatic Loom Works and Texas Instruments will build a $1.5 billion semiconductor factory in Japan that will make memory chips as well as chips for use in automobiles, according to the report this afternoon in Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The paper said that other companies in the Toyota Group would also invest in the factory.
1996-08-02	G.M. Sales Decline, but Chrysler's Surge	The General Motors Corporation's sales fell by 2.3 percent in July from a year earlier while the Chrysler Corporation's sales surged 18.8 percent, as overall demand for vehicles appeared to cool and shift toward mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks instead of cars. Nearly three-fifths of G.M.'s vehicle sales in the United States come from cars, while two-thirds of Chrysler's sales come from light trucks, which the industry defines as including mini-vans and sport vehicles. So the shift toward light trucks has particularly benefited Chrysler.
1996-07-04	Auto Sales in June Slowed From May's Frantic Pace	Auto sales slowed from a frantic sprint to a slow jog in June, suggesting a slowdown in economic growth, economists said. The annualized pace of sales dropped to 15.2 million cars and light trucks last month from a torrid 15.8 million in May, a downshifting that economists and Wall Street analysts greeted as a sign that the economy was settling down to a steadier pace and was less likely to overheat.
1996-05-24	Toyota Sold Fewer Cars, but Its Earnings Rose	The Toyota Motor Corporation, continuing its aggressive effort to cut manufacturing costs, reported today that net income had improved in its last fiscal year despite a decline in vehicle sales. The company also announced a wholesale shake-up of its board as part of an effort by Hiroshi Okuda, its aggressive new president, to rejuvenate management. Fourteen of the 54 company directors are being replaced, including two of the five executive vice presidents.
1996-05-21	Toyota and Matsushita To Make Batteries	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest car maker, and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the consumer electronics giant, said yesterday that they would set up a company in September to develop, manufacture and sell nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries for use in electric cars. The company, to be called the Panasonic EV Energy Company, will be capitalized at two billion yen, or about $18.6 million. Matsushita will own 60 percent; Toyota will take the rest. Matsushita has already developed a nickel-metal hydride battery for use in an electric version of Toyota's RAV4 light sport utility vehicle. Toyota said in April that it would start selling the electric-powered vehicles, which it said could run about 135 miles in urban driving between recharges, to United States fleet buyers. (Reuters)
1996-05-10	Toyota Is Planning West Virginia Plant	The Toyota Motor Corporation announced today that it would build a $400 million engine plant in West Virginia that would employ up to 300 people. The announcement came on the day that the company's president was quoted as saying Japanese-made Toyotas are superior to those produced in the United States.
1996-05-05	BEHIND THE WHEEL: Toyota Tacoma and T100 pickups;Disrupting Detroit's Tailgate Party	"IS it my imagination, or did country music start to saturate the airwaves about the time fancy new pickups spread from Marlboro Country to suburbia? In uncertain times, is there something reassuring about the quintessentially American attributes of, say, Wynonna Judd or the Dodge Ram Laramie Club Cab? 

     Of course, there's nothing really new about Nashville's steel guitars or Detroit's iron horses. But both have smoothed out their rough edges, slipped into fancy duds and headed uptown, or even off to the country club. Today's hot-selling trucks are more like a glitzy Garth Brooks than a grizzled Johnny Cash."
1996-05-04	Detroit's Sales Pace Slowed in April, With Ford Off 2%	In the auto business, April was a lamb to March's lion. Car and truck sales last month dropped to an annual pace of 14.6 million, seasonally adjusted, down from a sizzling 15.9 million in March. The April slowdown reflected surprisingly weak sales at the Ford Motor Company along with shortages of some General Motors autos, which were slow getting to dealers because of a 17-day strike in March.
1996-04-07	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota 4Runner;Another Float in the Off-Road Parade	"FOR a long time, I wrote a column called ""About Cars,"" and I'm beginning to think it's a good thing the name was changed. Many of the vehicles arriving from the factories these days are not cars but sport utility vehicles, those go-anywhere, carry-anything mules that have caught the public's fancy like some sort of square but sensible Hula-Hoops. I have a hard time remembering the last time my driveway wasn't full of ungainly four-wheel-drive boxes."
1996-03-31	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercury Sable vs. Accord and Camry;Circling the Wagons	IF the top brass of the Ford Motor Company kept rejecting sketches of a new Ford Taurus in favor of something bold and different, they certainly got what they wanted. But did they kill the golden goose in the process of coaxing out the latest egg? There are many who think that when it comes to the Taurus -- and its fraternal twin, the Mercury Sable -- bold and different spell ugly. Initially, I tended to agree, but I confess that the designs are growing on me, especially the wagon versions. At the risk of coming off as a fuddy-duddy, the wagon seems to have a more coherent appearance than the sedan, which looks to me as if the styling wizards concentrated so much on making the front end look like a trout that they ran out of time, money and good ideas for the rear.
1996-03-30	Toyota Sets A Buyback Of Its Stock	In a highly unusual move, the Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would spend up to $1 billion to buy back its own stock. Toyota's stock buyback appears to indicate that Japanese companies are beginning to pay more attention to their shareholders.
1996-03-06	Auto Sales Rise by 5.6%, With Ford's Flat in Month	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent last month, assuaging industry and Wall Street fears that the industry was heading for a stiff downturn. The Ford Motor Company reported nearly flat February sales today. Ford said its car sales fell 4.7 percent while its truck sales -- buoyed by its redesigned F-150 pickup -- rose 5.5 percent. Over all, Ford sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent last month. Sales of the Ford Taurus and its sibling, the Mercury Sable, fell 3 percent despite $600 rebates. But Ford was encouraged because the slip came as Ford reduced sales of the two cars to fleets by 26 percent, while retail sales of the cars rose 45 percent in February, said Joel H. Pitcoff, Ford's market analysis manager.
1996-02-18	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota RAV4;A Cute Brute Rocks to an MTV Beat	"A FRIEND'S daughter bounded into their kitchen and asked which family vehicle she could have for the day: the luxury sedan, the sport utility vehicle, or, heaven forbid, the mini-van. ""Yes!"" she exclaimed, rejoicing, as her mother tossed over the keys to their hulking Ford Explorer."
1996-02-06	Ford to Offer Cheaper Cars As Sales Sag	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would begin selling a lower-cost version of its redesigned Taurus sedan as it reported that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped in January, pushing the pace of total industry sales into negative territory, compared with levels a year ago. The cheaper Taurus -- which will be $605, or some 3 percent, less than the starting point for a Taurus now -- will be a new car called the Taurus G. It represents the latest retreat by Ford from its strategy of building ever-fancier cars and trucks and charging premium prices for them. Last month, as Taurus sales got off to a disappointing start for the year, Ford announced a $600 rebate through April 2.
1996-02-02	Toyota Plans Kentucky Site	The Toyota Motor Corporation will centralize supervision of its North American manufacturing operations at a new site in northern Kentucky, company and state officials said today. The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority approved an incentive package that could be worth up to $13.3 million in tax credits for the company in the coming decade.
1996-01-30	Breaking Out of Japan's Orbit	It has long been an article of faith in this industrially oriented society that, to borrow from an American saying, what's good for Toyota is good for Japan. But as the Toyota Motor Corporation and other big companies move more operations and jobs out of Japan, that equation is becoming less true. And that is creating new stress in the vaunted relationship between government and big business.
1996-01-06	Auto Sales in Japan Rose 4.8% in 1995	"Auto sales in Japan exceeded five million vehicles last year for the first time in three years, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association reported yesterday. Domestic vehicle sales climbed 4.8 percent, to 5.15 million last year, the second successive gain. The Japanese market share of the Toyota Motor Corporation stood at 39.4 percent in 1995, the first time in 13 years that it was below 40 percent. Analysts said a slow economic recovery in Japan and the growing popularity of mini-vans and station wagons would provide a further push to the industry this year. ""We estimate Japan's domestic vehicle demand at 5.463 million in 1996,"" said Noriyuki Matsushima, a senior analyst at the Nikko Research Center. (Reuters)"
1995-12-26	Toyota to Ease Seniority In Grooming of Managers	The Toyota Motor Corporation plans to make it easier for young staff members to rise to junior management positions, foreshadowing a possible change in the way it chooses senior executives. The changes, announced today as part of a reorganization, come four months after the company appointed a new president in an effort to deal with a falling share of the domestic motor-vehicle market and the effect of the strong Japanese yen on sales overseas.
1995-11-30	Toyota Truck Plant Expected in Indiana	"The Toyota Motor Corporation is expected to announce on Thursday that it has selected southwestern Indiana, an area hurt by a declining coal industry, as the site for a $1 billion pickup-truck plant with 1,300 jobs. Toyota scheduled ""a major business announcement"" for Thursday afternoon in Princeton, Ind. State and local officials, cautioning today that a deal had not yet been signed, were nonetheless cheered by the prospect of new jobs."
1995-11-21	Toyota Is Offering Used-Car Warranty	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would offer buyer-protection warranties on used vehicles. Toyota will join the Nissan Motor Company and General Motors Corporation's Saturn division as manufacturers offering warranties on used vehicles that are not luxury models.
1995-11-11	Toyota Says Profit Fell By 54% in Its First Half	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's biggest car maker, said today that pretax profit tumbled 54 percent in its fiscal first half as domestic market share declined and exports fell sharply. Another auto maker, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, said pretax profit rose 23 percent in the half. Mitsubishi has been a leader in capturing a share of Japan's growing market for sport-utility vehicles, while Toyota has lagged behind.
1995-11-04	TOYOTA SAID TO BE IN INDIANA PLANT DEAL	The Toyota Motor Corporation has chosen Evansville, Ind., as the site of its third factory in the United States, Japan's leading financial newspaper reported yesterday. The paper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported on its front page that Toyota's president, Hiroshi Okuda, would sign an agreement with the government of Indiana at the beginning of December. But both Toyota andGov. Evan Bayh of Indiana called the newspaper report premature, and local land ownership records offered no confirmation that any property had changed hands. The plant will make 100,000 T100 pickup trucks a year.
1995-10-24	China Chooses General Motors For Big Venture	China has selected the General Motors Corporation to be its partner in a $1 billion joint venture to manufacture cars in Shanghai, auto executives familiar with details of the project said today. By teaming with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, one of China's most profitable state-owned companies with an expert distribution and servicing network, G.M. will gain a dominant position in China's fast-growing car market.
1995-09-21	Toyota Doubles Its Holdings in Daihatsu Motor of Japan	Moving toward more efficient production, the Toyota Motor Corporation doubled its stake today in the Daihatsu Motor Company, a small Japanese car maker that is considered part of the Toyota group. The move, which increased Toyota's stake to 33.4 percent, appears aimed at allowing Toyota to get more control of Daihatsu in order to coordinate operations better and concentrate production in the most efficient plants of both companies.
1995-08-26	PRICE RISE SET ON 4 MODELS MADE IN NORTH AMERICA	Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. said yesterday that it would increase the suggested retail prices on its four models made in North America by up to 1.9 percent. Toyota said its Avalon base prices would rise 1.8 percent, while the Corolla, Camry and Tacoma would increase 1.9 percent. In addition, the company said some option package prices will increase, and destination charges will rise $23, to $420. None of the four models have significant design changes in 1996, and Japanese auto makers have tended to push a series of small price increases through the model year in part because of fluctuations in the dollar-to-yen exchange rate. Last week, the Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. said it was increasing 1996-model prices an average of 2.7 percent.
1995-08-11	Toyota Names President Outside Founding Family	The Toyota Motor Corporation reached outside its founding family today and named one of its liveliest and most outspoken executives as president, charging him with leading the automobile manufacturer through an uncharacteristic period of turmoil. The executive, Hiroshi Okuda, 62, will replace Tatsuro Toyoda, 66, who has been hospitalized since February and who will become vice chairman. Mr. Okuda, until now one of five executive vice presidents, will be the first president since 1967 who is not a member of the Toyoda family.
1995-07-19	International Briefs; Toyota Sees Low Sales Because of Rising Yen	Japan's largest auto maker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, announced yesterday that it had lowered its planned domestic production for the year. The auto maker said the rising yen and weakening overseas markets had led it to expect lower exports, and domestic sales were slower than anticipated. Toyota said it would cut domestic production 5.8 percent from its original plan, to 3.22 million vehicles. The company said it had lowered projections for domestic sales by 3.1 percent, to 2.17 million, and for exports by 8.8 percent, to 1.14 million. The company also said its production and exports in the first half of 1995 were down compared with the corresponding period in 1994, and its domestic sales had grown by only 1.2 percent, to 1.06 million vehicles. (AP)
1995-06-10	PRICE INCREASE OF 1.8% ON EIGHT '95 MODELS IS SET	Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. is raising prices 1.8 percent on eight 1995 models imported from Japan, citing the yen's sharp rise against the dollar. The decision to raise sticker prices an average of $354 follows similar moves by Nissan and Subaru on June 1. Toyota said the new pricing, which takes effect on Monday, will affect the Tercel, Paseo, Celica, Supra, Previa, 4Runner, Land Cruiser and T100. Prices on North American-made Corollas, Camrys, Avalons and Tacomas will not be raised. It is the third price increase in 1995 for Toyota, which raised sticker prices on some models nine-tenths of 1 percent in January and three-tenths of 1 percent in April.
1995-06-07	TOYOTA ASKS FOR 200 CHANGES IN G.M. CAR	The Toyota Motor Corporation has asked the General Motors Corporation to make about 200 modifications on its right-hand-drive Chevrolet Cavalier before Toyota begins selling the car in Japan early next year, a spokesman for Toyota said yesterday. Toyota's suggestions include changing the layout of the gas and brake pedals and repositioning the seats, the spokesman said. Linda McGill, a spokeswoman for G.M. in Detroit, said most of the requested changes had been part of the normal product development process between the two automakers since the project was announced in November 1993. She declined to say if G.M. would agree to all the modifications. Toyota is planning to buy about 20,000 of the cars, which it will sell under the Toyota name. Toyota and GM declined to estimate how much the changes would cost, but both parties said the additional charges would not scuttle the project.
1995-05-24	Toyota Considers Suit Against U.S. Sanctions	"The Toyota Motor Corporation is considering filing suit against the United States Government in an effort to remove or reduce the impending sanctions on luxury vehicles, company officials said today. ""If there is legal ground to act, we have to explore the possibility,"" Toshiaki Taguchi, a Toyota director in charge of North American sales and public affairs, said today."
1995-05-17	Toyota and Nissan Vow To Hold Prices, for Now	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that at least for the next month, it would not pass on to its dealers or customers the cost of tariffs imposed by the United States Government. This means that in the short term, Toyota, which sells its luxury cars under the Lexus name, is willing to risk losing tens of thousands of dollars for each car it sells rather than sacrifice its share of the market.
1995-05-17	100% TARIFFS SET ON 13 TOP MODELS OF JAPANESE CARS	Living up to its threat to impose harsh sanctions on Japan, the Clinton Administration placed a 100 percent tariff today on 13 luxury car models that accounted for $5.9 billion in sales in the United States last year, including the flagship products of Toyota, Nissan and Honda. The tariff, the largest ever imposed by the United States against any trading partner, is to go into effect at 12:01 Saturday morning. Customs inspectors will be instructed to double the wholesale price of every Toyota Lexus, Nissan Infiniti and a number of other cars that roll off Japanese transport ships -- an increase that would make the cars all but unsalable.
1995-05-11	U.S. Is Moving Against Japan Trade Practices On Two Fronts	Picking up a new cudgel in its confrontation with Japan, the Clinton Administration said today that it was filing a broad legal challenge against Tokyo's trading practices with the newly formed World Trade Organization, but would also go ahead with planned unilateral sanctions against Japanese imports. The two-pronged strategy, announced today at the White House by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, sets the stage for what both Governments have vowed will be one of their hardest-fought trade conflicts since Japan's huge trade surpluses with the United States began two decades ago.
1995-05-10	Japan Gets the Avalon	The Toyota Motor Corporation has started selling the United States-made luxury passenger car, Avalon, in Japan, Toyota said today. The Avalons, equipped with a right-side steering wheel for Japan's roads, are made at the Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky. Toyota said it hoped to sell about 15,000 of the cars annually in Japan.
1995-03-15	President of Toyota Ill	The Toyota Motor Corporation said yesterday that its president, Tatsuro Toyoda, 65, had been hospitalized with high blood pressure and would be away from work until the summer. Toyota said it would be run in the meantime by its chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda, and five executive vice presidents. The company's president, Tatsuro Toyoda, was taken by ambulance to a hospital on Feb. 24, and Toyota had said very little about his prognosis until yesterday. In addition to being president of Toyota, Mr. Toyoda is chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.
1995-03-02	Fall in Auto Sales Raises New Fears of Slowdown	Sales of cars and light trucks fell in February, in contrast to a robust period a year ago, according to company sales reports released today and estimates by analysts. The results were below the expectations of Wall Street analysts, heightening fears of an economic slowdown and sending auto stocks falling on the New York Stock Exchange.
1995-02-26	"BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Tercel;
An Upgrade From Economy Class"	"THE Toyota Tercel that arrived for a test drive certainly didn't look like an economy car. It wore a tastefully understated color -- a pastel ""wild mint metallic."" And although it was a two-door, it had a contemporary silhouette that made it look more substantial than the run-of-the-mill subcompact.

It sure didn't drive like an economy car, either. It handled with surprising flair; its new engine showed unexpected verve."
1995-02-19	A Czech Entrepreneur Makes Names for Himself	"SHORTLY after the Velvet Revolution opened the door to enterprising capitalists, an Austrian businessman suggested to Marek Nemec that he sell sewing machines. According to Mr. Nemec, then a monitor of seismic activity around nuclear power plants, the Austrian also suggested some names for his product, among them Visa, Royal and Toyota. Mr. Nemec says he chose the Toyota name at random and in 1990 began selling the Chinese-made sewing machines with the Japanese label to Czech department stores across the country.

""We were the first private company to specialize in sewing machines,"" recalls Mr. Nemec, ""including service and guarantees. After two years we applied for the Toyota name, and it was registered six months later -- and that's when the problems began."""
1995-02-11	Rebounding in Japan, Toyota's Profit Is Up	In a sign that the worst may be over for Japan's slumping automobile industry, the Toyota Motor Corporation today reported sharply improved earnings for the first six months of its fiscal year. Citing both the recovering Japanese market and its success in cutting costs, Toyota said that its parent company's net income for the six months that ended on Dec. 31 jumped 73.8 percent, to 68.5 billion yen ($685 million). Sales grew 2.1 percent, to 4.07 trillion yen ($40.7 billion).
1994-12-20	Toyota's Tercel infomercial draws a significant response from its youthful, hungry audience.	THE Toyota Motor Corporation believes it may have hit on the right technique to get through to young people today: a combination of daytime television, computer software and free food. Groping for a fresh way to promote the 1995 model of its small car, the Tercel, Toyota decided to try its first infomercial, testing a 28-minute advertisement in New York and Los Angeles during November. Toyota was hoping for a way to make the Tercel stick out from among its numerous competitors, which include Honda's Civic, Chrysler's Neon and General Motors' Saturn. The results were so encouraging that last week Toyota began broadcasting the advertisement in 15 markets around the country.
1994-10-25	Toyota Has Decided to Set Age Limits On Its Managers	The Toyota Motor Corporation wants a more youthful look -- not for its cars but for itself. Japan's largest automobile company has decided to set age limits for managers of certain ranks. From now on, the company said last week, its deputy general managers can be no older than 53 and section chiefs no older than 50. Managers who reach the age limits will be given a task like long-term strategy development in which they will have no subordinates but will receive the same salary.
1994-10-08	TOYOTA DEALERS IN JAPAN TO SELL FORD IMPORTS	Toyotadealers in Japan will begin selling imported Ford Motor Company cars for the first time, as the American auto maker expands its sales network to about 300 Japanese outlets. Ford said yesterday that it was adding 5 dealers and 13 outlets to its sales network in Japan by November or December, including stores to be operated under a new company formed by the Toyota Katsumata Group, a major owner of the Toyota Motor Company vehicle dealerships. The expansion is not limited to Toyota dealers. It includes a second Ford outlet by a Nissan vehicle dealer that joined the Ford channel in May, new dealerships by three Mazda dealers and an existing Ford dealer, and additional outlets by two other Ford dealers. Since January 1992, when President George Bush visited Tokyo to persuade Japan to open up its market to more United States goods, Japan's vehicle manufacturers have tacitly allowed their vehicle dealers to sell American cars, Ken Brown, a Ford spokesman, said.
1994-09-14	TOYOTA TO INCREASE U.S. CAR PRODUCTION BY 50%	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's top auto maker, said yesterday that it would raise the number of cars it makes in the United States by 50 percent, to almost 800,000 a year, by 1996 as a way to deal with the strong yen. Toyota's president, Tatsuro Toyoda, said that North American-built cars would account for more than 60 percent of Toyota's total United States sales by 1996, compared with 43 percent last year. Because of the rise in local production, Toyota's exports from Japan to the United States would fall by 28 percent by 1996. The company also said that all pickup trucks sold by Toyota in the United States will be made in the United States by 1995.
1994-08-27	Toyota Plans 3.5% Increase In '95 Prices	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that prices on 1995-model Toyota cars and trucks sold in the United States would rise 3.5 percent, or an average of $606, from the initial prices of 1994 models. The increase appeared slightly higher than those announced by Detroit's auto makers, which plan average increases of 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Japanese auto makers have been forced to raise prices more often and more sharply because of the rising value of the yen against the dollar, which makes exports to the United States more costly. The yen has risen to post-World War II highs against the dollar this year. The strong yen contributed to a fourth consecutive annual decline in profits reported by Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, on Thursday.
1994-08-26	Toyota Profit Declines for A 4th Year	The Toyota Motor Corporation, hurt by the strong yen and a weak Japanese car market, today reported its fourth consecutive annual decline in profits, with net income falling to the lowest level in at least a decade. But Japan's largest and richest automobile company also said it thought the worst was over, and predicted that sales and profits would rise in the coming year.
1994-08-26	A Back-to-Basics U-Turn in Japan	As part of its quality testing, the Toyota Motor Corporation used to require that sunroofs on its automobiles be opened and closed 1,500 times in a room cooled to 22 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Then it occurred to the company that few people opened their sunroofs even once when it was that cold outside. To cut costs, the required testing has been reduced to 500 times at a temperature of only 4 degrees below zero.
1994-06-26	"BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Celica GT vs. Acura Integra GS-R;
Of Running Shoes and Ruby Slippers"	"DRIVING the new Toyota Celica is like wearing a fine leather dress shoe. You can't run fast in it, and it costs more than other pumps might. But it's supple and sleek, fitting your foot as if it were custom-made. You feel, and look, great.

Driving the Acura Integra is like wearing a well-engineered athletic shoe. You can tear up a track. You feel, and look, macho."
1994-04-26	Toyota May Build a New Van in Kentucky	The Toyota Motor Corporation has reportedly decided to build a front-wheel-drive replacement for its Previa mini-van at its Georgetown, Ky., assembly plant starting in 1997, a sign that it intends to be more aggressive in the light-truck and multipurpose-vehicle segment of the American auto market. Articles in the trade press, confirmed unofficially by officials close to Toyota who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new seven-seat mini-van would be based on the mechanical specifications for a new version of the Camry sedan, which is coming in 1996. Toyota, the largest Japanese auto maker, plans to build roughly 70,000 mini-vans annually, a small number compared with the production of the American Big Three, which sold nearly 950,000 mini-vans last year.
1994-03-20	Think Japan Inc. Is Lean and Mean? Step Into This Office	TAKEHARU INUZUKA hunched over his work space amid the sea of desks that make up the Toyota Motor Corporation's Europe and Africa planning division. He was putting the finishing touches on a sales presentation to be made by another executive in a few days. The speech, about Toyota's European results last year and its plans for the coming year, would last 30 minutes. But preparing it had taken virtually all Mr. Inuzuka's time for two months, including many late nights and one time when he stayed in the office until 6 A.M. Much of the time was spent revising the text and the slides, often by hand instead of on a computer. And there were frequent meetings with managers at different levels to review the presentation.
1994-03-04	Toyota May Set U.S. Goals	The chairman of the Toyota Motor Corporation suggested today that his company would be willing to set voluntary goals for increasing its purchases of American-made automotive parts. The statement by Shoichiro Toyoda, made at a news conference in Nagoya, is the clearest indication to date that at least some of Japan's auto companies are planning to announce purchase plans for foreign components as part of a market-opening package that Japan is now preparing in response to complaints by the United States.
1994-03-02	New Toyota Production	The Toyota Motor Corporation today began making the first cars at its $800 million expansion plant in Georgetown, Ky. The new factory will allow the auto maker to almost double its annual United States production capacity to 400,000 by 1995. The expansion, in addition to the $1 billion Georgetown plant that started making cars in 1988, will result in total production of about 300 cars a day by this summer, company officials said.
1994-01-22	Toyota to Hire Designers On a Contractual Basis	Japan's big blue-chip companies are known for their loyal lifetime employees. But the nation's largest auto maker apparently thinks some such employees can get a little stale. In a departure from the practice of lifetime employment, the Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would begin hiring some automobile designers under one-year contracts.
1994-01-15	Toyota Head Likely to Lead Trade Group	"The chairman of the Toyota Motor Corporation, Shoichiro Toyoda, has been tapped to become the next leader of Japan's most powerful business organization, making him the chief spokesman for Japanese industry at a time of political and economic upheaval. Dr. Toyoda, 68, is expected to become chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations, known in Japanese as the Keidanren, after the retirement of Gaishi Hiraiwa, who is from the Tokyo Electric Power Company. The Keidanren chairman has been called the ""prime minister of the business world"" because of the organization's influence."
1993-11-20	Toyota Plans To Sell Cars Built by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation signed a first-of-its-kind agreement today under which G.M. will build right-hand-drive Chevrolet Cavaliers in the United States for sale in Japan under the Toyota name. The agreement is the first under which a United States auto maker will sell an American-made car in Japan with a Japanese nameplate, a G.M. spokesman, William J. O'Neill, said. Toyota plans to begin selling the Cavaliers in early 1996.
1993-11-09	Market Place; Toyota surges as investors bet on an increase in sales in Japan.	AT a time when the company might suffer the first operating loss in its history, the stock of the Toyota Motor Corporation has nonetheless started to break away from the pack. Toyota shares, traded on the Tokyo stock exchange, rose from 1,690 yen on Sept. 1 to 1,900 yen on Nov. 1, its highest level in more than two years. In the last few days, it has fallen back somewhat as the Tokyo market as a whole plunged, closing on Monday at 1,840 yen (about $17), unchanged.
1993-10-24	Feeling the Bumps in the Road At the Tokyo Auto Show	IN 1985, visitors to the auto show here were treated to a preview of Honda's new Accord, a car that crossed the Pacific and outsold all American models for three years running. The 1989 show marked the first sighting of Lexus, the Toyota luxury sedan that displaced Cadillacs, Mercedeses and Jaguars from garages of the wealthy. The once-obscure Tokyo Motor Show, held every other year, had suddenly become a gallery for the dynamic imagination of Japan's auto industry, whose creations provoked nightmares from Detroit to Turin.
1993-08-31	3 Japan Auto Makers' Debt on Credit Watch	The Standard & Poor's Corporation placed more than $25 billion of debt of the top three Japanese auto makers on credit watch with negative implications today, in a move that could eventually raise the borrowing costs for the Japanese automobile industry. S.& P.'s move was further verification of the deteriorating financial position of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company, which have been hurt by the soaring value of the yen and sharper competition from Detroit's Big Three auto makers.
1993-08-26	Strong Yen May Bring Operating Loss at Toyota	"The Toyota Motor Corporation, the strongest of Japan's automobile companies, may suffer its first operating loss ever this year if the Japanese yen stays at its current high level, officials said today. ""That means we are faced with the most serious potential crisis in our company history,"" Ryuji Araki, the general manager of Toyota's financial division, told reporters."
1993-07-21	A Corporate Campaign Tries Selling Toyota's U.S. Presence.	"IN the old days, the words ""economy car"" in advertising carried an unambiguous meaning. They described a vehicle that was small, affordable and efficient. These days, it's more complicated. Clouded by lopsided trade balances, a troubled economy and issues of protectionism, a sales pitch is not necessarily what it seems. For example, a current ad for Toyota appearing in news magazines shows a spiffy new four-door Camry in profile below big red and black letters that say, ""economy car,"" which it may well be, at a base price of $14,000."
1993-07-14	Big 3 Rebuffed on Minivans	Detroit's Big Three auto makers lost another round today in their attempt to convince trade officials that the Japanese were selling minivans below cost in the United States. The United States Court of International Trade, which serves as an appeals tribunal in trade issues, rejected arguments by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation that Japanese manufacturers had inflicted financial harm on them by selling minivans at less than fair market value, which is called dumping.
1993-07-13	G.M. in a Deal to Supply Engine Blocks to Toyota	The General Motors Corporation announced a contract today to supply engine blocks to the Toyota Motor Corporation, an example of what Japanese auto makers say is their growing effort to reduce trade frictions with the United States. Starting in mid-1994, G.M.'s foundry in Defiance, Ohio, will produce up to 180,000 engine blocks a year for Toyota's four-cylinder engine, used in the Toyota Camry built in Georgetown, Ky.
1993-04-17	Toyota to Sell G.M.-Made Cars in Japan	"In a deal that would increase American car exports to Japan, the General Motors Corporation has tentatively agreed to make up to 20,000 Toyotas a year in the United States for sale by the Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan. The ""conceptual"" accord, which G.M. confirmed today, came as Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan met with President Clinton for the first time in Washington."
1993-04-15	Sales Rise For Vehicles Built in U.S.	Sales of domestically built vehicles excluding those built by the Ford Motor Company rose 14.8 percent in early April from the corresponding period a year ago. In a deviation from its pattern of reporting on the same day as other auto makers, Ford said it would release its 10-day sales figures on Thursday. The Chrysler Corporation does not provide partial monthly figures; its sales are estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports. 'Demand Is Only So-So' Some analysts cautioned that demand could be slightly better or slightly worse once hard data from Ford and Chrysler were available.
1993-04-10	NEW VENTURE TO MARKET TOYOTA VEHICLES IN ROMANIA	The Nissho Iwai Corporation, Japan's sixth-largest trading company, has set up a joint venture in Bucharest, Romania, to sell Toyota cars and auto parts. The venture will market Toyota passenger cars and recreational vehicles, a Nissho spokesman said.
1993-03-24	Sales of Toyota Truck Below Expectations	The Toyota Motor Corporation's T100 was fearfully awaited by American auto makers as a 3,500-pound monster that could wreak havoc in one of the few corners of the automotive market the Big Three thoroughly dominates -- fullsize pickup trucks. Not to worry, at least for the moment. Sales of the new T100, despite hefty discounts, are sputtering. Toyota has confirmed a report in Automotive News this week that production in Japan is being slashed by two-thirds, to 1,000 units a month. The T100 is assembled by a Toyota affiliate, Hino Motors Ltd., at a factory in Hamura.
1993-03-16	Accounts	* The Connecticut Toyota Dealers Advertising Association, Hartford, to Saatchi & Saatchi DFS/Pacific, Torrance, Calif., to handle advertising for Connecticut's 16 Toyota dealers. The account was previously handled by O'Neal & Prelle, Hartford. Billings are estimated at $2 million.
1993-01-28	10-Day Comedy Festival	"Amid the gilt-and-mahogany precincts of the Milton Berle Room of the Friar's Club, the stand-up team of Dinkins and King announced yesterday what was billed as the largest comedy festival in American history. ""How many comedians will it take to bring New York City together?"" asked Mayor David N. Dinkins, announcing a 10-day, five-borough comedy festival that is to begin on June 3. He answered himself: ""As many as possible, and the more the merrier."""
1993-01-20	TOYOTA TO FORM PARTS UNIT IN CALIFORNIA	Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. said yesterday that it would spend about $75.5 million to form a North American replacement-parts division in California to speed delivery of replacement parts from Japan. The investment, which includes $67.5 million for a new parts warehouse in Ontario, Calif., to be built by 1996, is the first decentralization of responsibility by the Toyota Motor Company in Japan to one of its overseas subsidiaries, company officials said.
1992-12-22	TOYOTA DENIES REPORT ON USE OF G.M. TRUCK PLANT	"The Toyota Motor Corporation yesterday denied a published report that said the General Motors Corporation had asked the Japanese auto maker to use one of G.M.'s idle factories to build Toyota pickup trucks. G.M. officials did not confirm or deny the report, which appeared yesterday in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business newspaper. ""Certainly the utilization of idled facilities in the United States presents a potential area for discussion,"" John Mueller, a G.M. spokesman, said."
1992-12-21	Toyota-VW Venture	The Toyota Motor Corporation and Volkswagen A.G. will continue the joint production of commercial vehicles in Europe for two years after the current contract expires at the end of 1994, The Nihon Keizai newspaper has reported. The companies hope to raise production by 2,000 units, to 15,000 units a year, by the end of 1996.
1992-11-28	TOYOTA'S NEW MARK II OFFERS SUCCESS STORY	In a year that has brought Japan's car makers plenty of gloom, the Toyota Motor Corporation has something to celebrate: Sales of its second-best-selling car are so good that it is rushing to start up a new factory. Toyota Motor Kyushu Inc., which is a 100 percent Toyota-owned subsidiary, has pushed forward the start-up date of its 150 billion yen ($1.2 billion) manufacturing plant in southern Japan, Toyota officials said.
1992-11-10	TOYOTA TO BEGIN SELLING BIG PICKUP TRUCK IN U.S.	Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. will start selling its large T100 pickup truck on Thursday. The company, an American unit of the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan, is projecting sales of between 50,000 and 60,000 units in its first model year. Toyota's T100 marks the first foray by a Japanese manufacturer into the larger pickup truck segment, one of the few remaining segments in which American auto makers have had no Asian competition.
1992-07-30	Succession at Toyota Expected and Praised	It came as no surprise when Tatsuro Toyoda was named the new president of the Toyota Motor Corporation today. Of course he is the younger brother of the current president, Shoichiro Toyoda, and a member of the family that has controlled the company since its founding. But even aside from that, Toyota executives and some auto analysts insist, Mr. Toyoda is the right man for the job.
1992-07-29	Brother to Get Post at Toyota	The Toyota Motor Corporation today named Tatsuro Toyoda as its new president, succeeding his older brother, Shoichiro Toyoda. The change, which will be made official at the annual shareholders' meeting in late September, was expected and is part of a broader reshuffling of top company management.
1992-07-20	Japan Lures Auto Workers With 'Dream' Factories	"Move over, Disneyland. Make way for Nissan Human Land, as a company brochure describes the Nissan Motor Company's newest factory. Here workers toil not in the assembly plant or paint shop, but work happily in the assembly or painting ""pavilions."" They walk along Palm Street and over Flamingo Bridge. And they eat in an employee cafeteria called the Harbor View Restaurant, with a panoramic view of the loading docks."
1992-07-08	TOYOTA WILL TEACH SUPPLIERS TO IMPROVE QUALITY	The Toyota Motor Corporation said it would operate an office in Lexington, Ky., that would teach North American auto-parts suppliers how to improve productivity and quality. Toyota said that in pilot studies, United States suppliers had shown sharp declines in defects and increases in cost competitiveness.
1992-05-05	Toyota Plant in Kentucky Is Font of Ideas for U.S.	The ideas about factory work that the Toyota Motor Corporation was promoting around horse country here at first seemed too simple to be significant, the formulations of people who had only just noticed that thoroughbreds thrive on bluegrass. But as Toyota rules were tested -- as the company installed cords for workers to pull for help, which they do an average of 3,500 times a day, and systems were developed to improve efficiency and prevent assembly line mistakes -- the brilliance of their simplicity was difficult to deny.
1992-02-15	Prices Rise At Saturn And Toyota	Two auto makers raised their prices today, a day after a report that showed signs of an upturn in sales. The Saturn Corporation, the fledging small-car subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, said it would raise prices an average 1.8 percent, effective March 1. The Toyota Motor Corporation increased its prices by 3.2 percent for Toyota brand cars and by 5 percent on Lexus luxury cars.
1992-02-06	Japan's U.S. Plants Pose a Dilemma	Two Japanese auto makers are seeking Commerce Department permission to extend favorable duties they now receive on imported parts for their American-made cars. The companies want to expand their factories in the United States without paying higher tariffs on the additional parts they will need to import. Since opening their United States factories in the 1980's, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company, like Detroit's Big Three car makers, have held a special Government exemption that lets them pay duties of no more than 2.5 percent on parts they import for assembly. The standard duties for auto parts range from 3.1 percent to 11 percent.
1992-01-10	A Trade Mission Ends in Tension As the 'Big Eight' of Autos Meet	"President Bush's hopes of returning home with what he called an ""action plan"" to help Detroit began to unwind late this afternoon, in one of the most unlikely business meetings in the history of Japanese-American industrial rivalries. The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers -- three American, five Japanese -- gathered face to face in a hotel room in downtown Tokyo, with everyone in the room clearly understanding, and no one saying, that the American industry will probably never gain back the ground it has lost to Japanese imports and to Japanese cars made in American plants. A Tense Hour It was apparently the first time executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met directly with their counterparts at Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, which together now control more than a third of the American auto market. After a tense hour, during which the Japanese told their guests that American industry needed to transform itself radically, and the Americans warned that the time was long past when ""mere declarations of intent"" to open markets would suffice, Lee A. Iacocca, the fiery head of the ailing Chrysler Corporation, finally spoke up."
1991-12-12	Thankful for a Loss	"BRAD CULPEPPER, a defensive tackle, is thankful for Florida's only loss, 38-21, at Syracuse. ""We learned that if we're not fired up and if we don't play like an inspired team we're very average,"" he said. Since then, Florida (10-1), No. 2 in The New York Times's computer ranking, has won eight in a row, its first Southeastern Conference title and a Sugar Bowl match against Notre Dame. Culpepper, a history major who wants to be a lawyer, was honored yesterday as the Toyota Leader of the Year for his 3.2 average in graduate school."
1991-11-20	Met Museum Planning Center for Its Textiles	"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is planning to construct the world's largest and most sophisticated textile conservation center, able to handle weavings dating from 4000 B.C. to the present, the museum's director, Philippe de Montebello, announced this week. The 23,000-square-foot center, which Mr. de Montebello said would enable the Met to use its textile collections ""to their fullest potential,"" is to cost $10 million and is to be completed in 1995. It will be named the Antonio Ratti Textile Center after its principal benefactor, the 76-year-old founder and president of the Ratti Group of Como, Italy, the world's largest producer of printed silk fabrics."
1991-11-10	All About/Pickup Trucks; Will Detroit Lose Control of the Reliable Pickup?	Automobiles go through a metamorphosis every new model year. But pickup trucks are a constant. Though options have been added, the basic models have changed very little through the years. Such steadfastness has been good for Detroit. Pickup trucks, which account for about 18 percent of all vehicles sold, are one of the last segments of the market in which the Big Three still hold a substantial edge. Intensely loyal buyers make Ford and Chevrolet's full-size pickups their best-selling vehicles year after year, outselling even their most popular cars. Detroit dominates the compact and intermediate pickup categories as well.
1991-07-27	Toyota Australia	The Toyota Motor Corporation said it would begin building a $355 million car plant here early next year to insure its long-term survival in Australia. The first cars are expected to be produced in 1994, said Robert Johnston, the president of Toyota Australia. The plant, to be built in Altona, a western suburb of Melbourne, will include a body shop, assembly line and high-technology paint shop. Its annual capacity is projected at 100,000 cars. Toyota, the big Japanese car maker, has been making autos in Australia for 30 years.
1991-07-14	About Cars; New Faces At the Top	Placing first in the J. D. Power quality index is akin to winning an Emmy, and Honda's Acura division has managed to star for the last four years. For 1991, though, there are two new faces on stage, and they knocked Acura down to fourth place. The new players are Lexus from Toyota and Infiniti from Nissan, and they completed their first year of business by tying for top place in Power's prestigious Customer Satisfaction Index.
1991-07-09	Infiniti, Lexus Lead Consumer Survey	The two newest Japanese luxury car divisions, the Nissan Motor Company's Infiniti and the Toyota Motor Corporation's Lexus, tied for the highest ranking in a consumer satisfaction survey for 1990 by J. D. Power & Associates, a leading automotive market research company. The ranking is widely regarded as an unbiased assessment of how cars and trucks perform. Manufacturers with high quality ratings aggressively use the survey in advertising and marketing in the United States. The highest-rated American car line was the Cadillac, in eighth place in this year's listing. Mercedes-Benz was third, Acura and Honda tied for fourth, Toyota sixth and Audi seventh. The survey showed the Lexus and Infiniti divisions tied at the highest level of dealer and product satisfaction since the survey was created by J. D. Power in 1986.
1991-06-08	Auto Worker Dissidents Gain	Members of a dissident labor group have ousted leaders of the United Automobile Workers union at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., known as Nummi, a joint venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation in Fremont, Calif. In elections on Wednesday, the candidate of the dissident group, the People's Caucus, defeated the incumbent president of the local. Members of the dissident group were elected to three of five other top union positions. The caucus, which is loosely affiliated with a national U.A.W. dissident group called New Directions, argues for a more traditional, adversarial relationship between the union and management.
1991-06-01	Toyota Has No Hold On Electrical Supplier	"To the Editor: ""For the last two years, T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman who hates to be called a corporate raider, has been devoted to a colorful if quixotic effort to breach one of the strongest fortresses in Japanese business, the corporate empire built around the Toyota Motor Company."
1991-06-01	Big 3 Charge Mini-Van Dumping	Faced with a continuing loss of sales to Japanese auto makers, the Big Three filed an anti-dumping petition with the Government today, accusing four Japanese concerns of importing mini-vans at unfairly low prices. The industry's action seemed sure to aggravate trade tensions between the United States and Japan. Although the petition focused on a relatively narrow category of vehicles, one Big Three executive who requested anonymity described it as a warning shot.
1991-04-11	Toyota to Sell Cars in Israel, Officials Say	The Toyota Motor Corporation is expected to announce that it will begin selling cars in Israel despite the continuing Arab economic boycott of that country, officials of the Japanese auto maker said today. For the last two years, Toyota officials say, they hve been under mounting pressure from Jewish organizations in the United States to begin sales operations in Israel. The pressure has taken the form of letters to Toyota and to newspapers but has not involved any threats of a boycott, according to the officials.
1991-03-08	Toyota's Pickup	The Toyota Motor Corporation said it had delayed indefinitely its decision on making a large pickup truck. A spokesman, John McCandless, said a soft vehicle market and an uncertain economy had prompted officials to delay their decision. Toyota currently builds a compact pickup in Japan. Ford and General Motors' Chevrolet division dominate the highly profitable full-size truck market.
1991-02-19	Toyota to Cut U.S. Exports	The Toyota Motor Corporation will cut exports to the United States by 10,000 vehicles during February and March because of the soft American market, the company's president, Shoichiro Toyoda, said today. But Mr. Toyoda stressed at a news conference that the auto maker, Japan's largest, would not reduce production at its plants in California and Kentucky, since that could further damage the sagging United States economy. Toyota's sales in the United States fell an estimated 13 percent in January, compared with January 1990, to 63,568 vehicles, according to Yoshiharu Tateishi, a Toyota spokesman. In 1990, Toyota's exports to the United States fell by 4 percent from a year earlier, to 703,000 vehicles, but production in the United States rose by 39 percent, to 320,000 vehicles, Mr. Tateishi said. Toyota exported about 53,000 vehicles to the United States in February and 58,000 in March 1990, he said. Toyota's planned cut in exports followed similar announcements by other big Japanese auto makers last month. The Nissan Motor Company plans to trim exports by 4,500 to 5,000 vehicles in March, the Honda Motor Company by 20,000 in February and March, and the Mazda Motor Corporation by 8,000 in February and March. Honda also said it would trim production in Marysville, Ohio, by 5,000 vehicles between January and March.
1991-02-11	Toyota Profit Falls 1%	The Toyota Motor Corporation reported a 1 percent decline in net earnings on Friday despite increased sales for the six months that ended on Dec. 31. Japan's largest auto maker posted a profit of $1.16 billion, while its operating profit fell 15 percent, to $1.49 billion. Sales rose 16.6 percent, to $32.33 billion. The company cited higher labor costs and increased spending on research and development for the downturn in earnings.
1991-01-29	Lexus Prices Rise	Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. announced price increases of $1,000 for its Lexus LS 400 and $200 for the Lexus ES 250 luxury automobiles. The new base prices, effective Feb. 27, will be $39,000 for the LS 400 and $21,500 for the ES 250.
1991-01-10	Toyota Set to Expand in U.S. Market	In a bid to expand in the United States market, the Toyota Motor Corporation today announced a two-seat sports coupe made in Japan but aimed at young Americans buying their first cars. Robert McCurry, executive vice president of Toyota's United States sales arm, also told reporters today that he expects a decision within 60 days on whether the Japanese auto maker will build a full-size pickup truck for the United States market.
1991-01-01	As U.S. Car Makers Cut Back, Toyota Is Expanding Briskly	At a time when the American automobile industry is laying off thousands of workers, shuttering factories and bracing for a recession, Kunihiko Minami, the chief of operations at the Toyota Motor Corporation's sprawling Takaoka plant here, says he has his own problems: he cannot find enough auto workers. Even as the General Motors Corpo ration plans to close up to nine plants in the United States that employ tens of thousands of workers, Toyota is expanding at a breakneck pace and looking desperately for people to hire.
1990-11-28	Toyota Confirms Doubling Of Kentucky Plant Capacity	The Toyota Motor Corporation's plan to double its car-making capacity in Georgetown, Ky., officially announced today, will create one of the largest automotive complexes in North America. The expansion will give Toyota the ability to build 400,000 Camry models a year and challenge the Honda Accord and Ford Taurus as the most popular cars in the United States. The decision to locate the new $800 million assembly plant adjacent to Toyota's two-year-old Camry plant was anticipated, although it challenges the conventional wisdom that Japanese auto makers have tried to spread their American investments to as many states as possible to increase their political influence.
1990-11-27	Toyota Plant Is Expected For Kentucky	The Toyota Motor Corporation is expected to end months of speculation on Tuesday by announcing that it will build another automobile assembly plant near its existing factory in Georgetown, Ky.

""Unfortunately, there is still a relatively big gap between the quality of parts we buy domestically for Toyota cars and the parts we import,"" Mr. Obata said, pointing to a graph that showed defect rates 100 times higher for components supplied by 75 American and European companies than those supplied by 147 Japanese companies."

Union and Japanese officials hailed the agreement as a boon to labor relations in Kentucky and elsewhere in the United States. But officials representing construction companies said the pact discriminated against nonunion workers and vowed to attempt to block it in the courts.
1986-11-24	TOYOTA ADJUSTS ITS STRATEGY	On paper, the outlook at the Toyota Motor Corporation is anything but rosy these days. The company is forecasting a 2.3 percent decline in car shipments in the current, 1987, fiscal year and a 4.8 percent drop in revenues. Profits could fall to one-third of their level in the 1986 fiscal year that ended June 30, top executives warn. The culprit, of course, is the strong yen, which has forced up car and truck prices in the United States, the company's most lucrative foreign market, and squeezed profit margins so much that export earnings declined 66 percent last year, according to company officials. But there is no sense of panic in this tightly knit industrial community that was the boyhood home of Ieyasu Tokogawa, the great shogun, or military leader, of 16th century Japan. The Social Contract Instead, top Toyota executives say they will deal with an increasingly crowded world car market by relying on advanced technology, higher-priced luxury and performance car models and the painstakingly forged social contract between the company and its employees.

1986-11-10	YEN'S RISE FORCING TOYOTA TO TRIM SALES	Top executives of Japan's largest automobile company are responding to the rapid increase in the strength of the yen with a program their American counterparts might recognize: an attack on overhead and an appeal for Government help. In a series of interviews this week, officials of the Toyota Motor Corporation said they have started a campaign to cut expenses by reducing meetings, reports and overtime by as much as 50 percent and by consolidating the number of car models scheduled for sale. At the same time, they said the Japanese Government had been asked to cut corporate income taxes and to reduce taxes on the use of automobiles to stimulate domestic demand to make up for lost overseas sales. The increase in the value of the yen - from about 230 to the dollar last fall to about 160 currently - has had a sharp impact on the financial performance of Toyota, much of whose profits are derived from operations in the United States, according to company officials.

1986-09-08	TOWN'S INDUSTRIAL REBIRTH MIRED IN LABOR DISPUTE	On a vast rolling slope on the outskirts of this tiny town, the earth-moving machines of the Ohbayashi Corporation have already cleared several million tons of rock and soil to make way for a new Toyota automobile assembly plant. It seems only yesterday that Georgetown, a town of about 8,000 residents in the heart of Kentucky's bluegrass region, was dying. Then in December the Toyota Motor Corporation picked it for the $800 million assembly plant, and Georgetown could see itself becoming an industrial power. But Ohbayashi, one of Japan's biggest construction companies and Toyota's general contractor for the plant, has become the center of a feud with the nation's construction unions. The dispute, involving Ohbayashi's decision to use largely nonunion workers, is already delaying construction.

IN 1947, when most of Japanese industry was struggling to recover from wartime damage and a frail economy, a self-taught engineer named Taiichi Ono was put in charge of a machining shop at the Toyota Motor Corporation's Koromo factory. He set out to help improve the company's fortunes by eliminating waste in the production process. Waste to Mr. Ono was more than rejected parts or metal shavings on the floor. He saw waste in a worker standing idle, even if only for a few seconds, or parts piled in inventory waiting to be used.

However, they stopped short of saying they would oppose organizing efforts. The officials, including Eiji Toyoda, the chairman of the company, said there was a major difference between the Kentucky operation and the one it conducts as a venture with the General Motors Corporation in Fremont, Calif. Toyota accepted representation by the United Automobile Workers union at Fremont because of its history as a G.M. plant with a union work force, Mr. Toyoda said. ''We have a considerably different situation here as far as union matters are concerned,'' he said in an interview. ''We are not presently contemplating the subject of a labor union.'' $800 Million Plant Mr. Toyoda's remarks came as the company officially announced plans to build an $800 million stamping and assembly plant near Georgetown, Ky. The plant will produce about 200,000 cars a year starting in 1988 and will employ about 3,000 workers.

Raskin heralds the opening of a new era in labor-management relations in the start-up of production at the Fremont, Calif., auto plant jointly managed by Toyota and General Motors (''An Industrial Breakthrough,'' Op-Ed, July 23). But those familiar with both Toyota and G.M. as trade unionists have a different view. Is the price of cooperation the permanent loss of jobs to speedup and automation? Of the original 6,000 workers employed at the plant, the new company, New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., will hire only 2,500. And those only after careful screening of attendance records, disciplinary incidents and attitudes toward labor-management relations. Nummi has pledged only that a majority plus one of these 2,500 will come from the old union shop.

1985-07-26	THE JAPANESE SURGE IN U.S.	This week's announcement by the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan that it would build an automobile factory in the United States marks the development of an important new phase in the often turbulent economic relations between the two countries, according to Japanese officials and economists here. In a little more than a year, Japan has risen to the front rank of foreign owners of American industry, along with Britain, Canada, West Germany and the Netherlands. With the surge in investment, a country that has been most conspicuous, and often berated, for the goods it ships to the United States is now becoming conspicuous as well for the goods it makes in this country. Rise in Direct Investment Last year, according to the Commerce Department, Japanese companies and their affiliates in the United States poured $1.7 billion into American businesses in so-called direct investment, more than three times the average of $490 million annually that the country had spent over the preceding five years. Direct investment includes outright ownership of American factories or the ownership of 10 percent or more of an American enterprise.
1985-07-24	TOYOTA PLANTS SET FOR U.S., CANADA	The Toyota Motor Corporation at last is joining its major Japanese rivals in building its own factory in the United States. The company said today that it would build an assembly plant to produce 200,000 midsized cars annually beginning in 1988. It did not disclose the location, but most analysts expect the site to be in the Middle West.
1985-07-23	An Industrial Breakthrough	In this period of open war on unions by much of American management, the battered labor movement is getting succor from a surprising source - the biggest of big business. After four years of wage concessions, lost strikes and employer-inspired drives to decertify unions, labor leaders are exultant over the conclusion of contracts providing significant gains in union and job security at General Electric and the new California joint venture established by General Motors and Toyota. By the high-flying standards of the 1960's and 1970's, when major unions became accustomed to grabbing with both hands, the wage increases in both are modest. But the squeeze put on unions by the flight of manufacturing jobs overseas, automation, deregulation and the aggressiveness of hostile elements in industry has made survival the name of the game for them. The distinctive aspect of the agreements at G.E. and at G.M.-Toyota's New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. lies in the degree to which security provisions reflect a calculated decision by three giant multinational corporations to recognize that unions are here to stay.
1985-07-09	Toyota Seen Close To Plant Decision	The Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan is close to a decision on building an auto assembly plant in the United States and has discussed sites near Nashville and Kansas City, Mo., sources said today. Toyota probably will announce its decision this month, the sources said, and, if the plan is carried out, the plant will open in late 1987 or 1988.
1985-07-01	'JAPANESE' NOVA'S SALES ARE DELIGHTFUL TO G.M.	To Hector Lima, the only American characteristics about the new Chevrolet Nova he purchased recently were the nameplate on its grill and the fact that it was manufactured in the United States. There, he contended, its Yankee traits ended. ''It's got the feel of a Japanese car, it rides like a Japanese car and everything about it seems Japanese,'' said Mr. Lima, a 24-year-old Houston technician. ''When our friends saw it they said they liked it a lot, but that it looked just like a Toyota.'' Indeed, in marketing the Nova, the General Motors Corporation is straightforward about the part-Japanese heritage of the first fruit of its joint venture with Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation. ''We make no bones about the fact that it's a heavily Toyota-engineered product,'' said Ed Lechtzin, a G.M. spokesman. The model offers ''the best of both worlds,'' he said, repeating the advertising slogan adopted for the Nova.
1985-06-27	Pact Ratified At Fremont	The ratification of a landmark contract for members of the United Automobile Workers at the joint General Motors-Toyota auto making venture is ''icing on the cake'' for workers, according to a union official. The three-year contract, which virtually guarantees against layoffs and gives U.A.W. Local 2244 an unusual amount of access to decision-making, was ratified Tuesday by 92 percent of the 1,200 union employees at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.
1985-05-16	NISSAN PICKS CRAY COMPUTER	The Nissan Motor Company said yesterday that it had ordered a $6.5 million supercomputer from Cray Research Inc. of Minneapolis. The transaction has been closely monitored by United States trade officials as an indicator of Japan's intentions concerning the purchase of American-made high-technology products, Within hours, another Japanese car maker, the Toyota Motor Corportion, said it was purchasing a supercomputer from Fujitsu Ltd., one of three Japanese companies trying to enter a segment of the computer market that has been dominated by United States manufacturers. Nissan's purchase of the Cray machine came during heightened tensions over the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, and after intense lobbying by the Reagan Administration. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige wrote to Japanese officials on Cray's behalf, after industry rumors had circulated that Nissan was under pressure to buy from Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi is closely tied to the auto company, although Nissan's own technical experts preferred Cray's machine.
1985-04-13	TRUST SUIT DROPPED BY CHRYSLER	The Chrysler Corporation announced today that it had dropped an antitrust suit seeking to stop the joint production of Chevrolet Nova cars in California by the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan. Richard Goodyear, vice president and chief lawyer for Chrysler, said he could not comment on the reasons for the out-of-court settlement because its contents were sealed by the United States District Court in Washington, where the suit was filed in January 1984. Chrysler's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, had denounced the G.M.-Toyota accord as an illegal linkup of industrial giants that could severely damage competition in the industry.
1985-04-05	No Headline	''We are in a global industry now,'' declared Roger B. Smith, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation. ''All the companies in the automobile industry must consider how best to rationalize their facilities and production.'' Mr. Smith's comments came at the formal dedication today of one of the industry's most prominent such attempts, G.M's joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two companies are making Chevrolets in a former G.M. plant using Toyota's production system.
1985-02-11	DETROIT WOOS YOUNGER CAR BUYERS	She is about 34 years old and single, most likely a college graduate, and she earns between $30,000 and $35,000 a year. This is the customer who is the primary target of the General Motors Corporation's Chevrolet division as it prepares to bring the Nova, the product of its joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation, to market this summer. Research shows that 57 percent of all auto buyers are female.
1985-02-10	Small Cars Toughen Up	One attribute that Japanese cars have not been famous for is the ability to withstand crashes. But that seems to be changing.
1985-01-30	TOYOTA CALLS TUNE IN ITS G.M. VENTURE	Japanese auto manufacturers help insure that the interior of a car is installed properly by taking off the doors, so they will not be in the way, and then putting them back on farther down the assembly line. American auto executives have resisted the technique, saying it is too hard to get the doors to fit right the second time. But there is no argument about doors here, at the former General Motors Corporation assembly plant now operated by New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a 50-50 joint venture of G.M. and the Toyota Motor Corporation. On the Chevrolet Nova, the product of the new venture, the doors come off and go back on.
1984-09-06	Taiwan Scraps Toyota Deal	The Government today scrapped a $265 million joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan to produce subcompact cars here, a Government spokesman said. He said the Economic Ministry could not come to terms with Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker. Under an initial agreement signed last year, Toyota and 10 Taiwan companies were to set up a joint venture to produce 300,000 cars a year, most of them for export.
1984-08-24	NEW SPIRIT AT AN AUTO PLANT	Roscoe Dye, a 47-year-old auto worker, spent part of his day recently trying to assemble a truck. He was not working with steel, but with building blocks from a children's toy called Lego. It was one of many tests Mr. Dye had to pass in a four-day screening process before he was hired by Nummi, which is more formally known as New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the company born of General Motors' and Toyota's joint venture here. In the Lego exercise, said D. William Childs, Nummi's general manager of human resources, one person tells another how to assemble a truck, but the instructor is not allowed to use his hands. The purpose is to see how well applicants work together, to measure their creativity and to evaluate their leadership abilities.
1984-07-03	Toyota Still Trying On Taiwan Deal	The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest auto maker, has applied to the Government of Taiwan for an extension beyond Wednesday to continue its attempt to iron out the details of a joint venture with local companies, officials reported today. Seiichi Miyawaki, Toyota's general manager for the joint project, said most of the disagreements on export percentages and plant location had been resolved. Under the joint car- making agreement signed last July, Toyota would put up 45 percent of the $265 million investment, the Government-run China Steel Corporation would put up 25 percent and the remaining 30 percent would come from nine Taiwanese companies.
1984-05-02	G.M., Toyota Pick LOF	LOF Glass, a division of the Libbey- Owens-Ford Company, will supply all the glass for the General Motors Corporation venture with the Toyota Motor Company, a Libbey-Owens- Ford official said today. LOF will supply laminated windshields and tempered side and back windows made at its Lathrop, Calif., facility.
1984-04-12	G.M.-Toyota Deal Approved WASHINGTON, April 11	The General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation got the Government's approval today to proceed with a plan to jointly build small cars at a former G.M. assembly plant in Fremont, Calif. The Federal Trade Commission, on a 3-to-2 vote, made permanent the provisional approval it had granted the project last December.
1984-03-27	G.M.-Toyota Deal Gains	The Federal Trade Commission staff has recommended that the agency grant final approval to the proposed joint car-making venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation, an F.T.C. source said today. G.M. and Toyota hope to build up to 250,000 cars annually at an idle GM plant in Fremont, Calif., starting late this year.
1984-02-09	G.M.-TOYOTA VENTURE CRITICIZED BY IACOCCA	Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, said today that 300,000 American jobs would be lost if the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation were allowed to jointly build small cars. Mr. Iacocca described the G.M.- Toyota plan as ''patently illegal'' in testimony before a House Commerce subcommittee. He added that if the deal was consummated, Chrysler might be forced to build its small cars in South Korea or Mexico to compete.
1984-02-07	U.S. Backing G.M. Over Chrysler Suit	The Justice Department today lent support to the efforts by the General Motors Corporation to have a Federal court here dismiss the Chrysler Corporation's lawsuit aimed at blocking a proposed joint venture by G.M. and the Toyota Corporation. In receiving permission to file a brief in the case as a friend of the court, the department said that ''the United States will take no position on the substantive merits of Chrysler's antitrust claims.''
1984-02-06	Washington Watch; A Quandary For the F.T.C.	T HE Federal Trade Commission spent 10 months last year scrutinizing an agreement for a joint manufacturing venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Company before giving its antitrust approval, and the commission remains haunted by the monumental case. In fact, the F.T.C. worries that it may be forced this week to legally cloud its December decision and perhaps wind up in court. Representative James J. Florio, chairman of the commerce subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has asked the commissioners to appear at a hearing Wednesday to defend their decision, about which he has expressed strong doubts. Among other things, he says the future of G.M.'s competitors may be threatened by the project. The Chrysler Corporation has already filed a suit challenging it.
1984-01-26	G.M.-Toyota Documents WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (AP) - The Federal Trade Commission voted today to make public 1,385 pages of previously confidential documents related to the proposed joint car-making venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation.	The panel voted, 3 to 2, to release the information, with two commissioners opposed because they said the agency was still withholding too much information. The Chrysler Corporation, a chief opponent of the joint venture, also expressed concern that some material was to remain confidential.
1983-12-29	2 U.S. UNITS POSSIBLE FOR TOYOTA	The Toyota Motor Corporation, which won tentative approval last week for a joint auto making venture with the General Motors Corporation, could open a second assembly line here under an agreement between the two companies, spokesmen for Toyota and the Federal Trade Commission said today. Such a move would strengthen the Japanese auto maker's American foothold. Earl Kintner, Toyota's Washington attorney, said there is no plan to produce a second vehicle and called the idea a ''contingency'' in case protectionism in the United States stems the flow of cars Toyota currently exports from Japan. Under import quotas that expire next year, Toyota has been restricted to about 518,000 cars. Toyota sells most of its exported cars in the United States. ''You can readily see where there might be some pressure on Toyota to quickly gear up production,'' Mr. Kintner said.
1983-12-20	G.M. and Toyota Hit F.T.C. Snag	The Federal Trade Commission this evening abruptly canceled a Tuesday morning meeting at which it had been expected to approve a venture by the General Motors Corporation and Japan's Toyota Motors Corporation to jointly produce a Japanese-designed subcompact car in California, officials at the agency said. The two companies continued to bargain at the commission throughout the day in an effort to modify the plan to meet antitrust objections, but the negotiations remain snagged, according to an F.T.C. source who asked not to be identified. No new meeting date has been set.
1983-12-02	VENTURE BY TOYOTA AND G.M. GAINS	Staff officials at the Federal Trade Commission have effectively recommended to the full commission that a proposed $300 million auto making venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation be allowed to proceed. A commission official, who declined to be identified, said today that the agency's two principal fact-finding units and an outside consultant had reported to the commission that the benefits of the proposed venture far outweighed any anticompetitive implications. According to the official, there is a good chance that a final decision could be issued by Christmas. The five commissioners are not bound by staff recommendations, however, and have overruled them in the past.
1983-10-18	Toyota Sports Car	The Toyota Motor Corporation will display a new luxury sports car later this month at the Tokyo Motor Show and could start selling the mid-engine auto next year, a report from Japan said.
1983-10-15	Toyota, Nissan	The Toyota Motor Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company built more motor vehicles in September than they had a year earlier, according to reports released separately.
1983-10-11	THE TOYOTA-G.M. VENTURE	Last February the Toyota Motor Corporation and the General Motors Corporation, the largest automobile producers in Japan and the United States, announced an agreement under which the two companies would jointly produce a new front-wheel- drive subcompact car at a now-closed G.M. plant in Fremont, Calif., near San Francisco. The companies would be 50-50 partners in the $300 million venture, with Toyota investing about $150 million and G.M. contributing the plant and perhaps $20 million in cash. About 200,000 cars, a version of Toyota's Corolla called the Sprint in Japan, are to be turned out annually. G.M. would buy the cars and market them through its Chevrolet dealers. The joint venture, which would operate for no more than 12 years, is to be headed by a Japanese chief executive, although the bulk of the work force would consist of Americans. Production of 1985-model cars would begin late next year.
1983-09-21	FORD MIGHT SUE TO BAR TOYOTA-G.M. VENTURE	A top official of the Ford Motor Company said today that Ford might join with other domestic auto companies in filing an antitrust suit to block the proposed joint venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation. Harold A. Poling, Ford's executive vice president for domestic automotive operations, said ''an antitrust suit is one alternative that would have to be considered'' if the Federal Trade Commission approves the tie between G.M., the world's largest auto company, and Toyota, the third largest. Ford is the second-largest auto company in the world. Until now, opposition to the joint venture, which is to produce Toyota-designed subcompacts at G.M.'s Fremont, Calif., assembly plant, had been led by the Chrysler Corporation.
1983-09-18	JAPANESE AUTO LEADS FUEL EFFICIENCY RATINGS	The 1984 Honda Civic coupe is the most fuel-efficient automobile sold in the United States and the first gasoline- powered car to get the top rating in six years, the Environmental Protection Agency said today. The agency, in making public the Government's annual mileage ratings, said the Japanese two-passenger hatchback got 51 miles to a gallon of gasoline. The model, new on the United States market this fall, displaced the Volkswagen Rabbit Diesel as the most fuel-efficient automobile sold domestically, according to a guide made public by the Environmental Protection Agency.
1983-08-24	Toyota Plans Minivan	The Toyota Motor Corporation plans to introduce a minivan in early October. In a statement on Monday from its sales headquarters in Torrance, Calif., the Japanese auto maker said its Van Wagon would carry seven people or more than 1,500 pounds, would be aerodynamically styled and would get at least 24 miles a gallon.
