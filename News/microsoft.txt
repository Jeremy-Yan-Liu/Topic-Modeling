5/19/2012	Do You Want the Good News First?	Seattle I'VE spent the last week traveling to two of America's greatest innovation hubs -- Silicon Valley and Seattle -- and the trip left me feeling a combination of exhilaration and dread. The excitement comes from not only seeing the stunning amount of innovation emerging from the ground up, but from seeing the new tools coming on stream that are, as Amazon.com's founder, Jeff Bezos, put it to me, ''eliminating all the gatekeepers'' -- making it easier and cheaper than ever to publish your own book, start your own company and chase your own dream. Never have individuals been more empowered, and we're still just at the start of this trend.

4/24/2012	Technology Giants Take On Google in Patent Deal	SEATTLE - A plan by Facebook to acquire a broad range of patents through a deal with Microsoft is on its surface yet another twist in the battles over intellectual property engulfing the tech business. But the subtext of the deal is a different story, showing how two of technology's most powerful players are teaming up to create a greater balance of power on the Internet - a market that has been tilted decisively in favor of one company, Google, for years. ''This is almost certainly a move against Google,'' said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at Altimeter Group, a research firm. The agreement between Microsoft and Facebook, announced on Monday, came less than two weeks after Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 925 patents held by AOL. In a second deal, Microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents - about 650 in all - to Facebook for $550 million in cash, along with rights to 275 AOL patents Microsoft plans to retain. While Facebook and Microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents, it is expected that Facebook will end up with a range of patents involving mobile, Web and instant messaging technologies. Microsoft is likely to keep AOL patents involving search, among other things. The arrangement will help Facebook bulk up its intellectual property portfolio before its ini tial public offering, which is expected next month, and it is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company. ''This is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests over the long term,'' Ted Ullyot, general counsel of Facebook, said in a statement. The deal could also give Facebook additional ammunition in its escalating patent feud with Yahoo. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming violations of Yahoo patents, many related to online advertising. Facebook subsequently countersued Yahoo, in a pattern that is playing out again and again in different parts of the technology business, especially the mobile phone market. But in large part the deal is evidence of how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated ever closer to each other in part because of a common enemy, Google. Google has menaced Microsoft's business on a number of fronts, including with free online Google applications that compete with Microsoft Office and with Android, a mobile operating system that competes with Microsoft's Windows Phone software. As Facebook has evolved into a Web behemoth, with 900 million active monthly users, Google has become increasingly focused on tamping down the challenge to its business from the social network, introducing Google Plus, a rival social service. Google's big concern is that the bounty of data Facebook has about its users, including their tastes and friend connections, will turn it into a serious rival for online advertising dollars. There is also wide speculation that Facebook will start its own Internet search engine to rival Google. ''Microsoft is simply less concerned about the threat of social to its business than Google is,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, explaining why Microsoft is not concerned about competition with Facebook. ''This may be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' he added. Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, declined to comment. Microsoft has spent the last several years forging deeper connections with Facebook at every turn. Long stymied in its efforts to create an Internet search engine that effectively competed against Google, Microsoft two years ago struck a deal with Facebook to use data from the social network in Microsoft's Bing search engine to create more relevant search results. But the arrangement has not helped dislodge Google from its position of supremacy in Internet search. Years before that, Microsoft tried to acquire Facebook, but the social network's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, rebuffed the offer. Those conversations subsequently led to Microsoft's taking a small stake in Facebook, from which it stands to profit handsomely after the company goes public. In March, Google accounted for 66.4 percent of Internet searches in the United States, unchanged from the same month a year earlier, while Microsoft was in second place with 15.3 percent of the market, according to comScore. Microsoft's Bing search engine also supplies search results for Yahoo, which accounted for 13.7 percent of the search market during March. Microsoft has continued to lose money on Bing, including more than $2.6 billion in operating losses for its online division during its last fiscal year. Some executives within Microsoft have advocated selling Bing to another company, with the idea that a company better focused on the Internet market could pose a more credible challenge to Google, according to severalpeople with knowledge of the discussions who didn't want to be identified talking about internal deliberations.Over a year ago, Microsoft executives sent out feelers to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in acquiring Bing, though the overture was not officially sanctioned by Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, one of these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg declined, saying Facebook had too much else to concentrate on. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook. In its original patent deal with AOL, Microsoft either bought or won the ability to assign about 925 patents and patent applications, along with a license to several hundred other patents AOL did not sell as part of an auction of its intellectual property. If the deal announced Monday clears regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft would still own about 275 AOL patents and retain a license to the 650 patents that Facebook will own. In addition, Microsoft is granting Facebook a license to the 275 AOL patents that it is keeping. Yahoo's legal attack on Facebook came at a sensitive time, as the company nears an expected initial public offering. In a statement, Yahoo said the deal with Microsoft will not deter its lawsuit against Facebook. ''Nothing about today's action changes the fact that Facebook continues to infringe our patents,'' Yahoo said in the statement. ''Companies who purchase patents are often working from a position of weakness and take these actions to strengthen their portfolio. We see today's announcement as a validation of our case against Facebook.'' The deal with Facebook puts Microsoft in an awkward position since it could help strengthen one close partner at the expense of another, Yahoo. ''We are very sensitive to the importance of our relationship with both Facebook and Yahoo,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel said in an interview. ''We have enormous respect for the value of the Yahoo patent portfolio. Yahoo has been an important innovator in the Internet space.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

It is a critically important piece of software for Microsoft, which still depends on Windows and Office for most of its revenue. For all the attention given to Apple's iPhone and iPad, or Google's Android OS on phones and tablet computers, Microsoft's lasting market power can still influence how most people think about computing. ''In its time, Windows 95 put the Internet browser in the OS, and that led to widespread communications using computers,'' said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura securities who has followed Microsoft for years.

5/10/2006	Arts, Briefly; Grand Theft Auto Embraces Xbox	Rockstar Games, maker of the wildly popular and highly controversial Grand Theft Auto series of video games, right, announced yesterday that a new installment of the series is in development for Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console and Sony's PlayStation 3. The announcement came one day before the world's largest video-game convention, known as E3, opens in Los Angeles. As gamers and industry executives from around the globe have descended on Los Angeles, the potential development of a new Grand Theft Auto has been widely rumored, yet yesterday's confirmation is sure to become one of the main topics of discussion on the show floor. (But it appears unlikely that Rockstar will demonstrate any elements of the game at the convention.) The announcement was a blow to Sony because previous versions of Grand Theft Auto have had their debuts exclusively on PlayStation 2, which has helped sell the Sony machines. This time, Rockstar is making Grand Theft Auto for the Xbox 360 simultaneously with the Sony version. In addition, Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's games business, announced at Microsoft's E3 news conference that Rockstar would be making add-ons for Grand Theft Auto IV available by download over Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The game is to arrive in October 2007. SETH SCHIESEL

5/1/2006	Changing Conditions Mean Creation and Re-Creation	MICHAEL KATZ, president of RAE Internet in New Rochelle, N.Y., says he would like to earn an M.B.A. degree. But when he discusses his experience since starting the company in 2000 and the lessons he has learned from running a business, it sounds as though he could teach the courses, at least those for small business. Today RAE, which is best known for its subsidiary, Message Partners, a provider of Internet security, is well established -- so much that I.B.M. signed a reseller agreement with Message Partners in March. I.B.M. will sell the company's Message Processing Platform as part of an integrated solution on its System p servers for small to midsize businesses.
4/29/2006	Band of Activists in Europe Holds the Line in the Case Against Microsoft	Carlo Piana is part of a brigade of software activists and lawyers who formed a primary line of defense in court this week for the European Union in its antitrust dispute with Microsoft. Two years ago, Mr. Piana, a lawyer from Milan with a passion for technology, awakened to the news that the European Union had fined Microsoft a record 497 million euros (more than $600 million) for abusing its dominant position in the software market by designing and marketing software in ways that excluded rivals from the market.
4/29/2006	Microsoft Software Will Let Times Readers Download Paper	Microsoft and The New York Times unveiled software on Friday that would allow readers to download an electronic version of the newspaper and view it on a portable device. With Microsoft's new Windows Vista software, to be available in January, virtually any newspaper, magazine or book can be formatted into an electronic version and read online or off. The software would allow The Times to replicate its look -- fonts, typeface and layout -- more closely than its Web site now does.
4/28/2006	Judges Stress Intellectual Property in Microsoft Appeal	Lawyers for the European Commission and Microsoft faced tough questioning on Thursday about the 2004 antitrust ruling against the company. During cross-examination by 13 judges of the European Court of First Instance who are hearing Microsoft's appeal of the ruling, the sharpest questions were reserved for the commission. Judge John Cooke, who will write the decision in the case, appeared to chastise commission lawyers for not taking the company's concerns about protecting its intellectual property seriously.
4/28/2006	Is Microsoft Preparing Big Attack?	Microsoft reported strong third-quarter revenue growth on Thursday, but analysts said the company also telegraphed a significant increase in spending, an indication that it was preparing to take on its big online rivals, Google and Yahoo. The company reported a 13 percent increase in sales for the quarter, to $10.9 billion, and a 16 percent rise in net income, to $2.98 billion, or 31 cents a share, from $2.56 billion, or 28 cents, in the period a year earlier.
4/27/2006	New Tricks Of a Browser Look Familiar	ABOUT 85 percent of the Internet population uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser to surf the Web, even though it's relatively ancient, crusty with neglect and about as secure as a screen door. In what other industry would 85 percent of consumers choose such a product -- when better ones, also free, were also available? Trick question. Those consumers aren't actually choosing Internet Explorer; in fact, they're not choosing. They just use what came on their Windows computers. Thanks to this built-in following, Microsoft hasn't felt much need to keep Internet Explorer current. Version 6 has been creaking along for five years -- an eternity in Internet time.
4/27/2006	Microsoft Is Seen Near Ad Move	Microsoft is close to reaching a deal to buy Massive Incorporated, which makes technology that inserts advertisements into video games, a member of Massive's board said yesterday. The board member, Douglas P. Miscoll, a partner with the venture capital firm Newlight Associates, said the price was $200 million to $400 million, but he declined to be more specific.
4/27/2006	Communist Vietnam Lunges for Capitalism's Brass Ring	It was Lenin's birthday. The most important Communist Party meeting in five years was under way. And the star of the show was the world's most famous capitalist, Bill Gates. The president, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister all excused themselves from the party meeting on Saturday to have their pictures taken with Mr. Gates, who has more star power in Vietnam than any of them.
4/26/2006	Microsoft in European Court Says 2004 Ruling Is a Failure	While Microsoft and the European Commission took turns denouncing each other's interpretation of events that resulted in the 2004 antitrust ruling against the company, they did agree on one thing on Tuesday: The commission's remedy for restoring competition in the market for software that plays music and videos has failed. Microsoft was ordered two years ago to create a second version of its Windows system without its own program, Media Player. The company's appeal of that ruling and its penalties is being heard this week at the European Court of First Instance.
4/25/2006	U.S. Justices May Review Patent Case	The Supreme Court asked the Bush administration yesterday for help in deciding whether to review a patent dispute between the Microsoft Corporation and AT&T over technology used to improve Internet voice transmissions. The request, directed to the United States solicitor general, Paul D. Clement, signaled that the justices might have questions about a lower court ruling that allowed AT&T to seek royalties for programs installed in copies of the Microsoft Windows operating system on computers in foreign countries. The court generally heeds the administration's advice on whether to take up pending appeals.
4/25/2006	Discord at European Court Handling Microsoft's Antitrust Case	Forbidden from publishing dissenting opinions and guarded in their relations with the media, the judges who sit on the European Union's second-highest tribunal were once a picture of unanimity when they pronounced on merger reviews, trademark law and trade disputes. But that image was shattered last year when a sitting judge on the panel, called the Court of First Instance, Hubert Legal of France, broke with custom and accused some of his peers of issuing judgments favoring business over society.
4/25/2006	Microsoft Opens Appeal In Europe	Microsoft began its weeklong appeal of the European Commission's 2004 antitrust decision against it on Monday with an attack on the regulator's arguments for ruling against the bundling of Media Player in Windows. At the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, Microsoft and the commission, Europe's highest competition authority, both claimed to speak for innovation in the software industry.
4/24/2006	LOOKING AHEAD	BOOT UP -- In a busy week for Microsoft, a European court will conduct a weeklong hearing on the company's appeal of a 2004 antitrust ruling (begins on Monday). Microsoft also reveals its quarterly earnings, about a month after announcing that its next-generation operating system, Vista, will not be ready for this year's holiday shopping season (Thursday). HOMES AGAIN -- The Hatfields-and-McCoys battle between home buyers and sellers will be updated this week with the release of existing home sales for March (Tuesday) and new home sales for that month (Wednesday). STRONG SIGNAL -- AT&T, which is starting to look a lot like it did in 1984 before the government broke it up, announces its earnings this week (Tuesday). The heavy equipment maker Caterpillar is also scheduled to report (Monday). FED TESTIMONY -- Fed watchers will look for new signs of transparency on rates and rising inflation as Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testifies before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress (Thursday). ECONOMIC INDICATORS -- Consumer confidence for April (Tuesday); durable goods orders for March (Wednesday).

4/23/2006	China Wins Over Washington, But D.C. Proves a Bit Tougher	IF President Hu Jintao thought all Americans held the same opinion of China, the notion was surely dispelled last week during his visits to the nation's two Washingtons. In Washington the state, Mr. Hu beamed as he hobnobbed with the capitalist kings of computers, coffee shops and airplanes, who are among those making a mint in China's markets.
4/22/2006	After 2 Years, Microsoft Set To Appeal European Ruling	When Microsoft and the European Commission meet next week in a Luxembourg courtroom for the latest stage of their long-running antitrust dispute, they will each argue that time has proved them right. More than two years have passed since the commission, Europe's top antitrust authority, found Microsoft guilty of abusing its market dominance, fined it 497 million euros and ordered it to strip out an important element of its Windows operating system.
4/22/2006	Chief of Ask Jeeves to Lead Microsoft's Internet Unit	Microsoft has hired Steven Berkowitz, the chief executive of Ask Jeeves, to run its floundering Internet division, Microsoft said yesterday. Mr. Berkowitz became president of Ask Jeeves in 2001 and chief executive in 2003. He helped transform the service, which was introduced to answer questions posed in English phrases, into a search engine to compete with Google. Mr. Berkowitz continued to run the company after it was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp last July.
4/20/2006	Q & A	Advance Planning For Windows Vista Q. I want to buy a laptop. Should I wait until the new version of Windows comes out? A. The consumer release of Microsoft's new operating system, Windows Vista, has been delayed until early next year, so you would be waiting quite a while to buy a computer with the system already in place. If you don't want to wait, you can look for a new computer that has been qualified as ''Windows Vista Capable,'' which means that it has the minimum hardware components necessary to run the most basic version of Windows Vista.
4/20/2006	The Virtues of a Second Season	Fervent computer gamers and the detectives on ''N.C.I.S.'' do it, but I had no plans to add a second monitor to my computer system -- not until I bought an upgraded video card for my PC and noted it had output connections for two monitors. Once I saw that, I could not resist dusting off my old 14-inch monitor and plugging it in along with my new 19-inch L.C.D. Recent Windows and Mac computers (and some Linux systems) can operate with multiple monitors; with my computer's Windows XP operating system, it took only a few keystrokes and mouse movements to set things up. Once I saw how it improved my productivity, I was an instant convert.
4/20/2006	So Many Rackets, So Little Time	WHEN I have to kill a guy in New Jersey or go to an important mob meeting in Brooklyn, I tend to run late. I tell myself I'll just hot-wire a roadster and speed right over, but then I see some florist shop or nightclub that isn't paying my family protection money, and I just have to stop and have a chat with the owner. No matter how busy you are, there's always time for a shakedown. In the Electronic Arts action game The Godfather, it is easy to become distracted from the game's central story, wandering off to rob a bank, buy a shady business or steal a rival mob's truck.
4/20/2006	Circuits; A Single Display While You Smoothly Tag-Team Your Computers	Two monitors with one computer is one thing. But how about two computers with one monitor -- and one keyboard and mouse? That is the premise behind the Flip, a product from Belkin that lets a computer user switch between machines in style.
4/20/2006	For the Serious DVD and CD Collector, a Way to Keep Things Tidy	For heavy users of DVD's and CD's -- or those looking for a way to clear the clutter -- Sony offers the Vaio VGP-XL1B2 changer/recorder, which allows users to store, organize and manage up to 200 CD's and DVD's. The $799 unit, available now, works with PC's using the Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 operating system, which is designed to manage all-in-one PC-powered home entertainment systems.

4/13/2006	David Pogue: The OS Wars	David Pogue takes your questions about running Windows XP on a Mac.
4/13/2006	Run Windows And Mac OS Both at Once	ONLY a week ago, Apple released what seemed like an astonishing piece of software called Boot Camp. This program radically rewrote the rules of Macintosh-Windows warfare -- by letting you run Windows XP on a Macintosh at full speed. Now, some in the Cult of Macintosh were baffled by the whole thing. Who on earth, they asked, wants to pollute the magnificence of the Mac with a headache like Windows XP?
4/13/2006	Google Chief Rejects Putting Pressure on China	Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, whose company has been sharply criticized for complying with Chinese censorship, said on Wednesday that the company had not lobbied to change the censorship laws and, for now, had no plans to do so. ''I think it's arrogant for us to walk into a country where we are just beginning operations and tell that country how to run itself,'' Mr. Schmidt told reporters from foreign news organizations.
4/8/2006	G.M., Lucent and CBS Tackle Some Problems	FIXING lingering problems was at the top of the agenda for many big companies this week, from automakers to television networks. BURNING FURNITURE? General Motors hustled to raise much-needed cash by selling assets, notably a majority stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, for $7.4 billion immediately, with $10 billion expected by closing and a total of $14 billion over three years.
4/8/2006	Microsoft's Mac Attack	HELL froze over this week as Apple Computer unveiled Boot Camp, a free program that will allow its new Macintosh computers with Intel microprocessors to run Microsoft's Windows XP operating system as an alternative to Apple's OS X. The news media were agog and Apple's stock price zoomed at the announcement. In my view, it was mildly interesting, but hardly the revolution Apple users want to see. Many Mac enthusiasts view Boot Camp as a huge coup for Apple that will eventually take the computer hardware leadership away from Dell and the software leadership away from Microsoft. The more skeptical warn that Boot Camp shows the final mastery of the Apple platform by Microsoft. Both positions are absurd.
4/7/2006	Windows on Apple	Everyone saw it coming. First, Apple chose Intel, synonymous with Microsoft, to make chips for a new line of personal computers. Now Apple has announced Boot Camp, which will allow some versions of Windows to run more or less natively on an Apple machine. How you feel about this depends very much on whether you're a Windows or an Apple person. From one angle, Boot Camp looks like a sensible effort to expand Apple's slice of the personal computer market. So far, switching from a Windows desktop to a much sleeker iMac has meant abandoning Windows for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. That means giving up some highly specialized applications for which there is no Apple equivalent. For better or worse, Apple has never quite been able to destroy the preconception that Windows belongs to business in roughly the same way that Apple belongs to the arts. An Apple computer that can run Windows will do away with such distinctions.
4/6/2006	WINDOWS OR MAC? APPLE SAYS BOTH	After long imploring computer users to ''think different'' and defining the Macintosh as a lone bulwark against the Windows onslaught, Apple Computer has decided to open the gate, at least a bit. Two decades after the first Mac arrived, Apple said Wednesday that it would offer users of its latest models a simple way to run the Microsoft Windows operating system as well as its own.
4/5/2006	Microsoft Wins Big Order for Cellphone Software	Microsoft has won its biggest contract ever for mobile phone software, an order from the United States Census Bureau for 500,000 handsets. Microsoft plans to unveil the deal as early as today, Scott Horn, a general manager for the company, said in an interview. Microsoft expects to increase its mobile unit's sales to $1 billion in one to three years, from $337 million last year, and break the dominance of the Research In Motion BlackBerry wireless e-mail device.
4/5/2006	Yes, the New Macintosh And Windows Can Be Friends	YOU should see my new Windows XP computer. It's so cool looking. It's a compact, silent, rounded six-inch slab, only two inches tall. Its sidewalls are brushed aluminum, and the top is white acrylic -- with a big gray Apple logo in the middle. All right, you caught me. It's a Mac Mini.
4/1/2006	2 Sides Differ Over Results Of Hearing On Microsoft	Microsoft left a two-day antitrust hearing in Brussels on Friday claiming it had reached a breakthrough with European regulators, but regulators and rivals dismissed the claim as an exaggeration. Microsoft was making a last-ditch attempt to avoid daily fines of up to two million euros ($2.4 million) for failing to honor an antitrust ruling handed down by the European Commission in March 2004.
3/31/2006	U.S. Asks European Union To Be Fair in Microsoft Case	The United States government has intervened in Microsoft's antitrust dispute with the European Commission, urging it and the 25 national governments in the European Union to be fair to the company, American diplomats and European officials said on Thursday. Microsoft has complained frequently in recent months that it has been denied the right to a fair defense in the continuing antitrust case with the European Commission. It has also accused the commission of collaborating with its rivals in the software industry and denying it access to what it contends are vital documents it needs to prepare its defense.
3/30/2006	Concerns Voiced in Europe Over Microsoft's Next Windows	Microsoft and the European Commission once again may be on a collision course over the shape of the company's next-generation computer operating system, Windows Vista. Neelie Kroes, the commissioner in charge of competition and Europe's top antitrust official, warned that Microsoft could violate European antitrust laws if it bundled certain features with its Vista, her spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said Wednesday.
3/28/2006	Google, Once a Maverick in the Business World, Joins the Washington Lobbying Herd	For a company that takes pride in being the quintessential outsider, Google is moving quickly into the ultimate insider's game: lobbying. Started less than a decade ago in a Stanford dorm room, Google has evolved into a multibillion-dollar business, its search engine ubiquitous on the Internet. Its sprawling growth, fueled by a public stock offering in August 2004 that created a market behemoth, has now thrust it into the glare of Washington.
3/27/2006	Windows Is So Slow, But Why?; Sheer Size Is Causing Delays for Microsoft	Back in 1998, the federal government declared that its landmark antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation was not merely a matter of law enforcement, but a defense of innovation. The concern was that the company was wielding its market power and its strategy of bundling more and more features into its dominant Windows desktop operating system to thwart competition and stifle innovation. Eight years later, long after Microsoft lost and then settled the antitrust case, it turns out that Windows is indeed stifling innovation -- at Microsoft.

3/25/2006	G.M. Offers Pay for Its Workers to Go Away	KNOCKED on their heels, several companies struggled with setbacks this week. General Motors and Microsoft took steps to cope with problems long in coming, while federal prosecutors were staggered by a reversal in a very visible corporate corruption case. SILVER HANDSHAKES -- Unable to sell enough cars to keep its employees busy, General Motors offered to pay them to go away. In an agreement with the United Automobile Workers union, G.M. offered $35,000 to $140,000 to its 113,000 employees in North America if they agreed to leave their jobs. It also extended the offer to more than 20,000 employees of its quasi-independent supplier, Delphi.
3/23/2006	Microsoft Offers To Assist Rivals	Microsoft offered on Wednesday to give rival software companies unlimited technical support to help them develop programs that work smoothly with the Windows operating system, the company's latest effort to comply with a European Commission order and avoid daily fines of up to 2 million euros ($2.4 million). The company previously offered to give rivals 500 hours of free technical support. ''We are committed to doing everything in our power to address the commission's concerns,'' said Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel.
3/22/2006	Microsoft To Delay New System	Microsoft's long effort to deliver the next version of its Windows operating system suffered another setback yesterday when the company said that the system would not be ready for consumer personal computers for the holiday sales season. The Microsoft announcement, made after the close of the stock market, came as a surprise. For more than a year, the company had said it would deliver the new operating system, Windows Vista, sometime in the second half of 2006.
3/21/2006	Microsoft Develops Version Of Internet Software Tools	Microsoft faces a potent challenge as software is increasingly built and distributed as a service on the Internet. The company yesterday offered the most detailed glimpse to date of its strategic response: embrace the Internet software model, add its own offerings and link the new technology to the coming version of its Windows Vista operating system. It is a familiar game plan for Microsoft. From the spreadsheet to the Web browser, the company has rarely been a pioneer, but it has been very successful as a fast follower in new markets.
3/21/2006	Google Offers Search Service On Finance	Harnessing yet another data category to its search-engine prowess, Google is introducing a financial information service intended to compete directly with offerings from Microsoft, Yahoo and other sources, Google executives said Monday. Google said the service, at finance.google.com, would distinguish itself by providing stock charts with interactive qualities like those on its Google Maps service, allowing users to find deeper or specified layers of data by sliding the cursor.
3/20/2006	Microsoft Takes On Craigslist in the Battle for Classified Ads	CRAIGSLIST has taken on many giants. Can it survive a challenge from Microsoft? The software behemoth late last month started Windows Live Expo (expo.live.com), another node in its growing network of Internet services, and a direct stab at Craiglist's vital organs: free, local classified ads.
3/18/2006	That Other Madness This Month: Mergers	MARCH madness is not limited to college basketball. Billions of dollars in mergers were announced this week, building on the momentum created when AT&T offered to acquire BellSouth for $67 billion earlier in the month.
3/17/2006	Microsoft Reveals Plan to Take Business From I.B.M.	Microsoft began a $500 million marketing campaign yesterday to stir enthusiasm among corporate customers for its new products and grab business from I.B.M., its biggest rival in the business technology market. Microsoft's marketing drive and its strategic assault on I.B.M. comes as it prepares to roll out a series of new products in the second half of this year, led by Windows Vista and Office 2007. The company is positioning the new desktop offerings as a kind of dashboard for managing businesses, especially when linked to other new Microsoft programs for worker communications and collaboration, searching company databases, business intelligence and customer relationship management.
3/17/2006	Arts, Briefly; Microsoft in Deal With Epic Records	One day after Sony announced a delay for its forthcoming PlayStation 3 video game console, Microsoft tried to show that it was moving ahead with its Xbox 360 platform as it announced a modest promotional deal with Epic Records to provide high-definition videos as free downloads over the Xbox Live Internet service. The companies also said that Epic artists, including the singer Natasha Bedingfield, left, would play games against users over the network. As Microsoft tries to expand its foothold in the gaming market, Xbox Live has emerged as perhaps its most important weapon because its Japanese rivals -- Nintendo and Sony -- offer no similar service. So in addition to delivering worldwide gameplay, Microsoft has been offering additional video programming, like movie trailers, over the service. Later this year, Microsoft may offer a more extensive iTunes-like service that will allow Xbox 360 users to download full music tracks to the machine's hard drive. Microsoft's game unit is also trying to move into television. Earlier this week, the company announced a deal with 4Kids Entertainment, the company behind the Cabbage Patch Kids and Yu-Gi-Oh!, to develop a new television and game franchise called Viva Pi?ata.

3/16/2006	Gamers Voice Some Annoyance With Sony	Those who invest or work in the video game industry expressed little surprise yesterday at Sony's announcement that it would delay its next PlayStation console until November. The shock appeared limited to the industry's customers: everyday gamers. And the beneficiary seemed to be Microsoft. Until yesterday, Sony had maintained that the PlayStation 3 would be released in Japan this spring. But while industry insiders already assumed that the machine would not arrive in North America until the holiday season, many gamers here continued to hope that they could be hooking up a PS3 this summer.
3/11/2006	Microsoft Faulted on Response To Antitrust Ruling in Europe	The European Commission on Friday again accused Microsoft of flouting a 2004 antitrust ruling, with an independent monitor calling the company's responses ''incomplete, inaccurate and unusable.'' In a letter sent to Microsoft, the commission said its experts had again found that the company had not met the terms of the ruling, which imposed a fine of 497 million euros ($591.7 million) on the company two years ago.
3/10/2006	Google Acquisition Signals New Rivalry	Google Inc. said yesterday that it had bought the Silicon Valley start-up Upstartle, gaining its Writely Internet word processing software. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Writely lets users compose documents on the Web and share them with others, according to notes on Google's Web site yesterday. Upstartle released a test version of Writely software last August.
3/9/2006	Now, a Laptop You Can Hold In Your Hand	In a bid to crack the crowded market for hand-held computers and music players, Microsoft and two electronics companies, Samsung of Korea and Asus of Taiwan, plan to unveil an ultralight tablet computer on Thursday that melds a laptop and media player into a thin, new device. Samsung's device, the Q1, will use Microsoft's Windows XP Tablet PC Edition operating system. It is a product of Microsoft's so-called Origami project -- an effort to shrink and redefine the laptop, while bolstering the company's software sales for new hand-held devices. Asus will also produce a version.
3/3/2006	Next Version of Tablet PC's Said to Be Lighter and Smaller	Microsoft and Intel plan to announce next week that several industry partners will make small, light versions of a tablet personal computer, people close to the two companies said yesterday. The machines, which have been the subject of considerable speculation, will be tailored more for consumer entertainment than the larger tablet machines running Microsoft's Windows that were introduced in 2002. The larger tablets, typically with 12-inch screens, sell for about $1,500 and are used mostly by doctors, lawyers, architects and other professionals in office settings. A tablet PC has a touch-sensitive screen that allows input with a pen.
3/3/2006	Push to Create Standards For Documents	With government records, reports and documents increasingly being created and stored in digital form, there is a software threat to electronic access to government information and archives. The problem is that public information can be locked in proprietary software whose document formats become obsolete or cannot be read by people using software from another company. To cope with the problem, 30 companies, trade groups, academic institutions and professional organizations are announcing today the formation of the OpenDocument Format Alliance, which will promote the adoption of open technology standards by governments.
3/3/2006	Microsoft Accuses Europe Of Colluding With Rivals	Microsoft's battle with the European Commission escalated Thursday, as the company accused the commission of colluding with its competitors in the software market and of again withholding documents it says are crucial to its defense in an antitrust case. With the threat of daily fines of 2 million euros ($2.4 million) hanging over it, Microsoft is facing a new suit brought just before Christmas, when the commission accused the company of failing to honor the antitrust ruling made in March 2004. In that ruling, the commission found the company guilty of monopoly abuse and ordered it to change the way it sold its software in Europe.
2/27/2006	Is Microsoft Dropping Cryptic Hints About a New Gadget?	A cryptic Web site that was set up by Microsoft but does not bear its name appears to hint that the company will reveal information about a new consumer product on Thursday. The site caused a flurry of speculation on Internet gadget gossip sites over the weekend. The Web site, www.origamiproject.com, suggests that the introduction of a personalized mobile device that ''will change your life'' is in the offing, but gives no details. It promises an update on Thursday.
2/26/2006	In Sony's Stumble, The Ghost Of Betamax	AT first glance, Amir Majidimehr does not look like a game-changer in the battle to develop the next generation of DVD players and discs. As the vice president for Windows digital media at Microsoft, he neither steers a Hollywood studio nor controls one of the many consumer electronics giants that are betting billions of dollars on one of the two new formats that promise to play high-definition movies and television shows. Yet when he and his team in Redmond, Wash., decided last September to abandon their neutral stance and to support Toshiba and its HD-DVD standard over the Blu-ray format led by Sony, the unexpected change of heart reverberated through the technology industry.
2/26/2006	Not Enough Consoles, Not Enough Games	THERE is bad news on the horizon for the video game industry: Ibe Ozobia Jr. is considering selling his Xbox 360 console. Mr. Ozobia, 32, of Las Vegas, an avid gamer who spends 25 hours a week roaming and shooting in virtual worlds, was ecstatic last November when he picked up his new 360. But something has gone wrong: too few good games have been produced for the console, he said, and he is bored. ''My system is just sitting there, waiting for a game,'' he said.
2/23/2006	Just for Fun, Casual Games Thrive Online	Not all gamers choose games based on how much adrenaline they muster, how elaborate the play is or how realistic the graphics are. Many looking for quick entertainment would instead prefer simplicity in their digital diversions. There are many casual games available for those players who would rather snack than engorge on their gaming entertainment.
2/23/2006	In Europe, Microsoft Faces A New Antitrust Complaint	Microsoft's antitrust battle in Europe intensified Wednesday when some of its biggest rivals filed a new complaint against it, accusing the company of a wide range of antitrust abuses. I.B.M., Oracle, Sun Microsystems and six other companies submitted a formal complaint to the European Commission on Wednesday, claiming that Microsoft continues to abuse its dominant position in the software market in spite of a 2004 European antitrust ruling against it.
2/22/2006	Grants Given By Microsoft For Relief Aid	Hoping to improve the way charitable groups handle their disaster responses, Microsoft is donating $41 million in software and cash to two groups of humanitarian agencies to foster collaboration and communication. The grants will be used to upgrade technology systems that have been pieced together over decades, assess the groups' technology needs and create forums online so they can exchange information and work on problems together.
2/17/2006	Dell Reports Higher Profit, But Expects Less Growth	Dell reported revenue growth of 13 percent in its fourth quarter yesterday, but analysts warned that it was not performing like the growth company of the past. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., reported profit of $1.01 billion, or 43 cents a share, a 51 percent increase over its $667 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.
2/16/2006	Web Firms Questioned On Dealings In China	Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Cisco Systems came under fire at a House human rights hearing on Wednesday for what a subcommittee chairman called a ''sickening collaboration'' with the Chinese government that was ''decapitating the voice of the dissidents'' there. The statements by the chairman, Representative Christopher Smith, Republican of New Jersey, opened a much-anticipated session aimed at getting an accounting of the companies' dealings in China, and to air criticism that they do business there at the peril of human rights.
2/16/2006	Disney Media Downloads for the Youngest of Computer Users	Disney Online, best known for Toontown, a massively multiplayer Internet game for children, has begun a $50-a-year subscription service for the most discriminating of audiences: preschoolers. The service, Playhouse Disney Preschool Time Online, marries Web features (for managing a child's progress and dispensing biweekly doses of learning games) with larger downloads of content that can reside on a hard drive, providing fast-playing games and TV-like animation.
2/16/2006	Microsoft Lashes Out at European Regulators	In a stinging rebuke to the European Commission, Microsoft insisted Wednesday that it had complied with the commission's antitrust requirements and sharply criticized the way the regulator had conducted its compliance review. Microsoft, facing possible fines of 2 million euros a day, submitted a 75-page response to the commission, Europe's top antitrust authority, just hours before a midnight deadline. The company said it had met the requirements of the commission's antitrust ruling of March 2004, and accused the commission of obfuscation.
2/14/2006	World Trade Group Rules Tax Benefits by U.S. Illegal	The World Trade Organization ruled yesterday that tax breaks the United States gives to some of its largest companies are illegal and the European Union said it would impose new trade sanctions in three months unless the tax breaks were abolished. The ruling is the second in four years involving tax breaks that the United States granted to 6,000 exporters, including Boeing, Microsoft and General Electric, initially under the Foreign Sales Corporation program and subsequently under the American Jobs Creation Act.
2/4/2006	Online Trail Can Lead To Court	Who is sending threatening e-mail to a teenager? Who is saying disparaging things about a company on an Internet message board? Who is communicating online with a suspected drug dealer? These questions, and many more like them, are asked every day of the companies that provide Internet service and run Web sites. And even though these companies promise to protect the privacy of their users, they routinely hand over the most intimate information in response to legal demands from criminal investigators and lawyers fighting civil cases.
2/3/2006	Microsoft Says Europe Blocks Its Defense	As the antitrust noose tightened around Microsoft in Europe, the company went on the offensive Thursday, accusing the European Commission of denying it access to documents it needs to defend itself. The commission quickly denied that was the case, saying it was too soon in the process for Microsoft to be making such a claim. Microsoft has until Feb. 15 to respond to the commission's December statement that the company has not complied with a March 2004 antitrust ruling.
2/1/2006	Microsoft Amends Its Policy For Shutting Down Blogs	Microsoft unveiled new company guidelines yesterday intended to spell out how it will deal with government censorship demands, in China and anywhere it does business, and limit the impact of its compliance. It was responding to criticism that followed its decision to shut down five weeks ago, at the Chinese government's request, the online journal of a popular blogger in Beijing who used the Microsoft network.
1/30/2006	Microsoft Would Put Poor Online By Cellphone	It sounds like a project that just about any technology-minded executive could get behind: distributing durable, cheap laptop computers in the developing world to help education. But in the year since Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory, unveiled his prototype for a $100 laptop, he has found himself wrestling with Microsoft and the politics of software. Mr. Negroponte has made significant progress, but he has also catalyzed the debate over the role of computing in poor nations -- and ruffled a few feathers. He failed to reach an agreement with Microsoft on including its Windows software in the laptop, leading Microsoft executives to start discussing what they say is a less expensive alternative: turning a specially configured cellular phone into a computer by connecting it to a TV and a keyboard.
1/29/2006	The Voices In My Headset	It's become something of a running joke in our apartment: when my girlfriend Amy returns home to find me sitting on the couch, she inevitably asks, ''Who are these friends that you're talking to?'' But no one is there -- I've been talking to the voices piped in through the gray and white Xbox 360 headset I have strapped to my noggin, while my fingers tap away at a matching controller in my hands. In November, I was one of the lucky 1.3 million or so consumers who got hold of the highly coveted Microsoft video gaming console. With it, I got access to the company's Xbox Live network, an Internet hub where gamers come ostensibly to compete against one another in electronic sports or first-person shooters, but mostly just to gab.
1/27/2006	Microsoft Profit Rises 5%, Meeting Analysts' Forecasts	Microsoft said on Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 5 percent, matching Wall Street's forecasts, as the high cost of introducing the Xbox 360 game console was offset by strong sales of servers and software tools. The company said net income was $3.65 billion, or 34 cents a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, a period that included 1 cent a share in tax benefits. That compares with net income of $3.46 billion, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
1/26/2006	Microsoft to License Part of Key Code to European Rivals	Facing daily fines from European regulators, Microsoft said on Wednesday that it would license some of the source code for its Windows operating system to competitors. The move is an attempt to comply with a ruling by the European Commission in March 2004 that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws. The company was fined 497 million euros (about $600 million) at that time and ordered to share details of its operating system with rival software makers.
1/24/2006	U.S. Says Microsoft Dallies In Adhering to Settlement	Microsoft is not complying quickly enough with its antitrust settlement with the government, the Bush administration said on Monday. In a court filing, Justice Department lawyers said Microsoft was falling behind on providing technical information mandated by the settlement.
1/15/2006	China, Still Winning Against the Web	IT wasn't so long ago that the Internet was seen as a trap for China. The country desperately needed to foster economic growth, and in the early 1990's much of the globe was plugging itself in. Sooner or later, the thinking went, China would have to plug into the Web, too, and however efficiently its leaders might have controlled information in the old days, they would be no match for this new democratic beast, decentralized and crackling with opinion and information from the four corners of the earth.
1/6/2006	Microsoft Shuts Blog's Site After Complaints by Beijing	Microsoft has shut the blog site of a well-known Chinese blogger who uses its MSN online service in China after he discussed a high-profile newspaper strike that broke out here one week ago. The decision is the latest in a series of measures in which some of America's biggest technology companies have cooperated with the Chinese authorities to censor Web sites and curb dissent or free speech online as they seek access to China's booming Internet marketplace.
1/5/2006	A Marriage Not Made In Heaven	YOU thought the apocalypse was upon us when Apple switched to processor chips from Intel, which Mac fans had considered the Dark Side for more than 20 years? Well, try this on for size: Palm's new Treo 700W cellphone-organizer runs on software from Microsoft. Yes, that Microsoft, whose palmtop software was mocked by Palm employees for years as bloated and inefficient.
1/1/2006	Most-Admired C.E.O. Is Not an Oxymoron	Movie stars, supermodels and even high school students have their own popularity contests, so why not chief executives? Burson-Marsteller, the public relations firm, recently teamed up with the Economist Intelligence Unit to fill that yawning gap in human knowledge by surveying 685 ''global business influentials'' to rank the world's most-admired C.E.O.'s. At the top of the list is Bill Gates of Microsoft. Oops. He hasn't been a chief executive for more than five years, since he anointed himself ''chief software architect'' and made Steven A. Ballmer the C.E.O. in January 2000. But never mind.
12/24/2005	Microsoft Quits MSNBC TV, but Web Partnership Remains	Ending a partnership that soured long ago, Microsoft and NBC announced yesterday that they would dissolve their joint ownership of the cable news channel MSNBC, with NBC taking control. NBC has completed a deal to assume majority control of the channel immediately, with an 82 percent stake, and it will become the sole owner within two years, NBC executives said yesterday. The two companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal.
12/23/2005	Microsoft Facing Fines In Europe	The European Commission turned up the heat yesterday on Microsoft, the world's largest software company, threatening to fine it more than $2 million a day unless it agrees to share more technical information with competitors. The commission's warning is the latest salvo in its increasingly acrimonious dispute with Microsoft over just what the company must do to comply with a 2004 antitrust ruling by the European Union. But the move also points to the growing gap between the antitrust policies of the United States and Europe.
12/21/2005	Game Maker Cuts Forecast As Industry Seems in Slide	Electronic Arts, a bellwether company among video game makers, reported on Tuesday that its holiday sales would be ''well below'' earlier projections, the latest sign of a sharp slide in performance for the industry. The announcement from Electronic Arts, the largest independent game publisher, came less than a week after Activision, a competitor, also reported unexpectedly weak holiday sales. NPD, a market research company, reported last week that video game software sales were down 18 percent last month from November 2004.
12/19/2005	The Advertising Column; AOL Choice Of Google Leaves Gates The Outsider	This time, it was Microsoft that was snubbed at the last minute. In 1996, America Online agreed to offer Netscape's Internet browser to its five million customers. A day later, the nonbinding agreement was shunted aside when AOL announced that it had instead chosen Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser in a $100 million deal.
12/19/2005	Need to Find An Xbox 360? Buy a Ticket To Tokyo	In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers.
12/17/2005	Time Warner to Sell 5% AOL Stake to Google for $1 Billion	Rebuffing aggressive overtures from Microsoft, Time Warner has agreed to sell a 5 percent stake in America Online to Google for $1 billion in cash as part of an expanded partnership between AOL, once the dominant company on the Internet, and Google, the current online king. At stake in this battle was leadership in Internet advertising, which is a growing threat to other media companies. The loss is a blow to Microsoft, which had sought AOL as a partner in its advertising venture to undercut Google, its potent rival.
12/16/2005	Patent Lawsuit Seeks to Block Microsoft's Wireless E-Mail Service	Visto, a maker of software for wireless e-mail, filed a patent lawsuit yesterday seeking to block the sale and operation of an e-mail service developed by Microsoft. The suit, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, was made a day after Visto licensed patents belonging to NTP, the company that is engaged in a patent challenge to Research in Motion. The NTP case could shut most service to the BlackBerry communications device.
12/12/2005	Adobe's Deal for Macromedia May Help It Fend Off Microsoft	Adobe Systems and Macromedia spent more than a decade as fierce rivals in the software market. Now they are hoping that by banding together they can be better positioned to face increasingly aggressive competition from Microsoft. Early this month, Adobe completed its $3.4 billion acquisition of Macromedia, giving it control of Flash, Macromedia's crown jewel, a software tool for developing multimedia applications for the Web.
12/11/2005	Can This Man Reprogram Microsoft?	THINK back to Round 1 of the Internet, when things really got rolling in 1995. The computing landscape was shifting, and a cool, fast-growing young company symbolized the new order: Netscape. At the time, Microsoft looked to be a lumbering old war horse, trapped in the yesteryear of desktop personal computer software, word processors, spreadsheets and operating systems. It seemed, in other words, so 1980's. But, of course, Microsoft emerged a winner. It embraced the Internet and vanquished the Netscape threat with hard work, ingenuity and strong-arm tactics that a federal court ruled violated the nation's antitrust laws. Microsoft's shares soared to a record high at the end of 1999.
12/10/2005	Prize in Indian Talent Search Is a Year on Bill Gates's Team	Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, announced a contest Friday to identify promising software students in India, offering as top prize an internship with his technical team for a year. The contest comes amid another in India: the race between low-cost, open-source software and proprietary software, like Microsoft's Windows. The open-source movement, which promotes the Linux operating system, is finding increasing favor over proprietary systems among users and software developers in India.
12/8/2005	Microsoft Joins Industry Trend Of Investing Heavily in India	Microsoft will invest $1.7 billion in India over the next four years and nearly double its employee ranks in the nation, its chairman, Bill Gates, said Wednesday. Mr. Gates's announcement was the third in a recent spate of $1 billion investments proposed by technology multinationals in India.
12/7/2005	Windows Ruling in Korea	South Korean regulators have found that Microsoft breached antitrust rules, a ruling the company has said may force it to withdraw its Windows operating system from the nation. Microsoft must offer multiple versions of Windows within 180 days and pay a 33 billion won ($32 million) fine, the Korea Fair Trade Commission said today. It said the company's inclusion of its Media Player and MSN Messenger programs with Windows hurt consumers.
12/6/2005	AOL Deal May Omit Stake Sale	Time Warner may not be selling a piece of America Online after all. Time Warner is still in negotiations with Microsoft and Google over a variety of potential deals involving its AOL unit. But most of the possibilities under discussion do not involve either company's buying a stake in AOL, an executive briefed on the negotiations said yesterday. Rather, they would involve cooperation on Web search, advertising sales and possibly other areas, the executive said.
12/4/2005	Whitelist	At last month's annual conference of the Computer Security Institute, the keynote speaker was one of those privacy nuts who exhorts businesses to tighten up their software and databases lest they threaten customers with ever-more-dangerous identity theft.
12/3/2005	Game Theory:  What Good Is Sitting Alone Killing Friends?	More than once, playing Microsoft's new Xbox 360 has made me remember what it's like trying to bicycle down a steep road slick with water and maybe even an ice patch or two. It is a fond memory and perhaps one to keep in mind as Sony and Nintendo try to respond to the success of the 360.
12/1/2005	Hooked On the Web: Help Is on the Way	THE waiting room for Hilarie Cash's practice has the look and feel of many a therapist's office, with soothing classical music, paintings of gentle swans and colorful flowers and on the bookshelves stacks of brochures on how to get help. But along with her patients, Dr. Cash, who runs Internet/Computer Addiction Services here in the city that is home to Microsoft, is a pioneer in a growing niche in mental health care and addiction recovery.
11/29/2005	Music Players and Game Consoles Are Topping Lists	Two of the most-coveted consumer electronics items this holiday season are the Apple iPod music player and the Xbox 360 game console from Microsoft, according to retailers and industry analysts. That represents a major shift in buying intentions this year.
11/28/2005	Popular Demand	The Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video-game console, went on sale last week with all of the requisite hype. Some models have landed on eBay, for several hundred dollars over list price. Customers at Gamefly, one of several online subscription game sites, reserved their favorites early. The games included sports classics like Madden N.F.L. '06, above, and Tiger Woods P.G.A. Tour '06, and newer action games like GUN. The Top 10 list reflects the titles available now for Xbox 360. SHELLY FREIERMAN
11/26/2005	Designer of Supercomputers Leaves Cray to Join Microsoft	Burton Smith, a longtime supercomputer designer and chief scientist at Cray, has resigned to take a position at Microsoft. Mr. Smith was a founder of Tera Computer, which in 2000 acquired Cray Research from Silicon Graphics. The company, which was based in Seattle, was renamed Cray.
11/25/2005	Microsoft Ups the Console Ante	There is a saying in technology circles, often delivered with rueful respect, that if you give the folks at Microsoft enough chances, they will eventually deliver a compelling product. They did it with spreadsheets. They did it with Web browsers. And now, with the new Xbox 360, the Bill Gates team has delivered a legitimately excellent gaming and home media system. And there is nothing rueful about that. Certainly, the graphics are incredibly detailed, lifelike and vivid, far beyond anything conceivable in the current generation of game consoles. Playing an Xbox 360 game can be almost like controlling a Pixar animated film or inhabiting ''Band of Brothers.'' And that's on a regular old television. On a high-definition set, get ready for your eyes to weep.
11/23/2005	The Xbox Has Arrived; Let the Game Playing Begin	Around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, Mike La was scoping out a darkened Target store in nearby Daly City, Calif., on his Honda motorcycle when a police officer pulled up. The officer knew exactly what was going on. ''He asked, 'Are you here to buy an Xbox 360?' '' Mr. La, 23, recalled later. When Mr. La said that was his intention, the officer pointed him to another part of the building where a line of customers waited for the store to open.
11/22/2005	Microsoft Plans to Ease Format Rules	Microsoft said on Monday that it would seek approval to make the software formats behind its Office programs an ''open standard'' that it would license free to competitors, partners and developers. Jean-Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft International, said some pressure had been brought to bear on the company in recent years by members of the European Union and by the European Commission, asking it to be more accommodating of open standards. ''They asked us to do more work on our formats, and we've done that,'' he said.
11/21/2005	New Xbox Goes on Sale At Midnight. Good Luck.	The transition to a new generation of video game consoles kicks off tonight at midnight when retailers begin selling Microsoft's Xbox 360. The event is a much-anticipated step in an intensifying business battle between Microsoft, a relative newcomer to the video game industry, and Sony and Nintendo. Sony plans to release its own successor console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, while Nintendo is expected to follow later in 2006.
11/21/2005	TiVo to Transfer Shows to iPods, Sony PSP	TiVo, the maker of digital video recorders, plans to announce a new feature on Monday that will let TiVo owners watch recorded television shows on Apple's video iPods and on Sony's handheld PSP game machine. The announcement builds on TiVo's release in February of an update to its video recorders that allows its users to transfer programs to personal computers and DVD's, as well as to portable video players that support Microsoft's mobile video format. When the company releases new software in the first quarter of next year, it will extend that capability to the video iPod, released last month, and the Sony PSP.
11/18/2005	Building a Better Boom	IT sure feels like a bubble, doesn't it? Let's tick off the signs: a red-hot market for Internet stocks (Google, for example, has more than quadrupled since it went public in 2004); fawning articles celebrating entrepreneurs; a glut of venture capitalists elbowing one another to invest in companies with no plans on how to make money past some hand waving about ''advertising'' and plenty of vague claims about how their technology will ''change the world.'' The Internet is exciting again, and once again folks are rushing in. In some categories -- like search or social networking, for example -- there are scores of start-ups vying for pretty much the same market, and it's certain that, just like last time, most of them will fail.
11/17/2005	American Ingenuity, Irish Residence	The newest expatriates aren't people. They're ideas, and we can't afford to watch them go. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Microsoft had trimmed more than $500 million from its annual tax bill by putting a small subsidiary in Dublin in charge of $16 billion in assets. The game is simple: a company sends intellectual property to a tax-haven country like Ireland and keeps the tax difference on the money it earns. The world is used to seeing manufacturing businesses move to countries where labor is cheaper, like Mexico or China. But profits from software created and designed at Microsoft's headquarters, in Redmond, Wash., should be taxed in America, not Ireland. Unfortunately, outsourcing is extending itself to taxes, in large part because the United States Congress has given businesses the loopholes to do it. That means that America's greatest asset -- its intellectual property -- could be sent offshore to reduce corporate tax burdens.
11/17/2005	Q & A	Page Numbers In Microsoft Word Q. I am writing a book using Microsoft Word and would like to skip numbering on chapter-division pages but resume numbering on the following page. How do I do this? A. In current versions of Microsoft Word, one way to adjust page numbers within a long document is to make each chapter a separate section. You can then manually adjust the page numbers within that section.
11/15/2005	Microsoft Enters the High-Performance Computing Fray	In January a group of Microsoft researchers set out to discover how much computing power they could buy for less than $4,000 at a standard online retailer. They found the answer at NewEgg.com, where they were able to purchase -- for just $3,632 -- 9.5 gigaflops of computing speed. That is the amount of computing power offered by a Cray Y-MP supercomputer in 1991 at a cost of $40 million.
11/12/2005	Microsoft Settles Antitrust Suit Over Windows in South Korea	Microsoft will pay the South Korean Internet portal operator Daum Communications $30 million to settle an antitrust suit over the bundling of an instant-messaging program into its Windows software, Microsoft said Friday. As part of the settlement, Daum, which offers its own messaging service, agreed to drop its suit and its complaint to the Korea Fair Trade Commission, Chung Ji Eun, a spokeswoman for Daum, said.
11/11/2005	Grand Theft Auto? No, Make Mine Volvo	REMEMBER the Vin Diesel-Paul Walker racing movie ''The Fast and the Furious''? A new racing video game for the Microsoft Xbox system, created on behalf of Volvo, might be billed The Safe and the Cautious. The game, actually called Volvo Drive for Life, serves as a showcase for the Volvo nameplate, three Volvo models and the longtime Volvo brand identity as the car designed with safety foremost. Unlike most racing video games, which reward players for speed, Volvo Drive for Life encourages them to proceed judiciously by taking them through a training course at the Volvo proving grounds in Gothenburg, Sweden, before sending them out on famous highways to drive while avoiding accidents.
11/10/2005	Microsoft and Associated Press to Join in News Video Distribution	Microsoft said yesterday that it would develop a news video distribution network for The Associated Press and share in advertising revenue generated by the newspapers and broadcasters that use it. The A.P. Online Video Network will be available to the news service's 3,500 United States newspaper and broadcast members at no charge in the first quarter of next year, the companies said.
11/9/2005	Internet Services Crucial, Microsoft Memos Say	Microsoft must fundamentally alter its business or face being at a significant competitive disadvantage to a growing array of companies offering Internet services, according to memorandums written by two of the company's top executives. Last week, Microsoft, the largest software maker, announced that it would offer two new Internet services -- Windows Live and Office Live -- in response to companies including Apple, Google, Salesforce.com and Yahoo that have created new businesses based on direct Internet connections with users.
11/9/2005	Corrections	A front-page article on Sunday about the competitive threat that businesses perceive from Google misstated the title of Bill Gates at Microsoft, a company that is trying to overtake Google's Internet search offerings. He is chairman, not chief executive.
11/8/2005	In Oregon, Brushing Up Their Shakespeare, Helped Along by Software	For nearly 30 years, Michael Schroeder, a computer research scientist, has been a loyal fan of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland. He is so devoted that in July 2001, when he was interviewing for a job with Microsoft, he flew from Medford, Ore., to San Francisco one morning and hurried back to Ashland for that evening's performance of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor.'' Mr. Schroeder ended up taking the Microsoft job. A couple of summers later, when he attended a donors dinner in Ashland, he asked if the festival would be interested in receiving software along with his usual cash contribution.
11/8/2005	Microsoft Updates Business Database Program	Microsoft released an updated version of its database program for large corporations yesterday, the first of a series of major updates to its core technologies that it plans to introduce in the next year. The new version of SQL Server, the first major one in nearly five years, is intended to improve Microsoft's ability to compete with Oracle, the leading seller of corporate database software.
11/7/2005	Bringing the Arcade Home On a Video Game Machine	Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will, of course, expect to play big, expensive marquee games like Call of Duty 2 from Activision and Madden N.F.L. 06 by Electronic Arts. But the Microsoft Corporation is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet.
11/7/2005	Many Suitors, and Many Pitfalls, as AOL Seeks a Partner	Microsoft has emerged as the front-runner in the talks surrounding the potential sale of a stake in America Online, two people involved in the negotiations said. But despite a flurry of interest in AOL from Microsoft, Google and others, finding a deal has been harder than Time Warner may have hoped. Behind the scenes, a number of questions remain that could hold up or even derail a potential transaction.
11/7/2005	Beware Your Trail of Digital Fingerprints	IT hardly ranks in the annals of ''gotcha!'' but right-wing blogs were buzzing for at least a few days last week when an unsigned Microsoft Word document was circulated by the Democratic National Committee. The memo referred to the ''anti-civil rights and anti-immigrant rulings'' of Samuel A. Alito Jr., a federal appeals court judge who has been nominated to the Supreme Court by President Bush. The stern criticisms of Judge Alito rubbed some commentators the wrong way (Chris Matthews of MSNBC called it ''disgusting'' last Monday). But whatever the memo's rhetorical pitch, right-leaning bloggers revealed that it contained a much more universal, if unintended, message: It pays to mind your metadata.
11/4/2005	From Gunpowder to the Next Big Bang	There is a techie adage that goes like this: In China or Japan the nail that stands up gets hammered, while in Silicon Valley the nail that stands up drives a Ferrari and has stock options. Underlying that adage is a certain American confidence that whatever we lack in preparing our kids with strong fundamentals in math and science, we make up for by encouraging our best students to be independent, creative thinkers. There is a lot of truth to that. Even the Chinese will tell you that they've been good at making the next new thing, and copying the next new thing, but not imagining the next new thing. That may be about to change. Confident that its best K-12 students will usually outperform America's in math and science, China is focusing on how to transform its classrooms so students become more innovative.
11/2/2005	Microsoft to Offer Web Services, Competing With Google and Yahoo	Microsoft introduced on Tuesday two new advertising-supported Web services, Windows Live and Office Live, as a direct response to the formidable challenges posed by its major competitors, Google and Yahoo. The new online initiatives will deliver services to businesses and consumers directly via the Web, in many cases, without the need to download the applications to a computer. As such, they are an important step in extending Microsoft's reach beyond the desktop PC to smart phones and other Internet-connected devices.
10/28/2005	Microsoft Says Profit Rose 24%	Microsoft rode a wave of global strength in the personal computer market to report growth in profit and sales in the first quarter of its 2006 fiscal year, slightly exceeding analysts' expectations. Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, said Thursday that quarterly revenue was $9.74 billion, 6 percent higher than $9.19 billion in the quarter last year. Earnings rose 24 percent, to $3.14 billion, or 29 cents a share, from $2.53 billion, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
10/26/2005	Microsoft to Offer Online Book-Content Searches	Microsoft announced Tuesday that it planned to join the online book- search movement with a new service called MSN Book Search. And in a nod to the growing influence of a recently formed group called the Open Content Alliance, Microsoft announced its plans to join it. The group is working to digitize the contents of millions of books and put them on the Internet, with full text accessible to anyone, while respecting the rights of copyright holders.
10/24/2005	Microsoft to Enter Market For Business Intelligence	Microsoft Office, the familiar toolbox of desktop computing, is a huge and lucrative business, but demand has slowed. In a new bid for growth, the Microsoft Corporation plans to announce today that it is making an ambitious push into the $13 billion-a-year market for business intelligence software. The company is trying to lure new business by extending Office well beyond its well-known programs for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Business intelligence software is used to help workers quickly find and analyze information inside their corporations. The programs offered by a variety of suppliers range from software used to automatically retrieve hourly or daily sales results to sophisticated analytics programs used to detect fraud and money-laundering.
10/17/2005	At Microsoft, Interlopers Sound Off On Security	In a windowless war room where Microsoft manages worldwide computer security crises, George Stathakopoulos, the general manager for security, opened a small refrigerator, revealing three bottles of Champagne. ''These are for the arrests,'' he said, with a brief smile.
10/13/2005	Big Hitters Said to Want Piece of AOL	Google and Comcast are in talks with Time Warner to buy a portion of America Online, according to several people with knowledge of the negotiations. The joint bid was widely seen as a way to head off Microsoft, which has also been negotiating to buy a minority stake in AOL. The development means that Time Warner, which has long been under pressure by Wall Street to sell off its AOL unit, now finds itself in the enviable position of having multiple suitors, which may drive up AOL's value.
10/12/2005	Antitrust Suit Turns Into A Partnership For Microsoft	Microsoft finally put its antitrust troubles in the United States behind it yesterday by agreeing to pay RealNetworks $761 million to settle a lawsuit. The two former enemies agreed to forge a partnership that promises to heighten the competitive pressure on the dominant company in digital music, Apple Computer. The announcement reflects how much the landscape in the software and digital media markets has changed in the last few years. The strategies and interests of Microsoft and RealNetworks have shifted as well, making them allies.
10/12/2005	Messaging Agreement Expected by 2 Rivals	Microsoft and Yahoo plan to announce Wednesday that their competing instant messaging systems will interconnect, making it possible for users to send messages between the previously incompatible systems, according to a person involved in the announcement. Until now the major instant messaging systems have been isolated from each other. Time Warner's America Online service has the dominant share of the instant messaging market, with MSN Messenger from Microsoft and Yahoo Instant Messenger ranked second and third.
10/11/2005	A Game Console for the Rest of Us	Note to hard-core video game players: Microsoft says it is aiming for your mothers and wives. In the coming weeks, Microsoft plans to introduce a marketing campaign to expand the appeal of the new Xbox 360 game console beyond the young men who are the Xbox's biggest fans.
10/9/2005	The Consigliere	'If you have a good idea in America, you can do business,'' says Michele Caniato, sitting in a conference room in his office on West 25th Street. ''In Italy, no one takes you seriously if you are under 50.'' At 36, Caniato presides over Culture and Commerce, a design consultancy that matches Fortune 500 companies and cultural institutions with designers like Philippe Starck and Marcel Wanders. ''I wrote Rem Koolhaas a letter recently, and he responded,'' he says, uncorking a goofy smile that seems at odds with his wheeling-and-dealing reputation. ''That would never happen in Italy.''
10/8/2005	Game Theory:  Going a Few Rounds With the Newest Console	You know you are at a different sort of industry function when the second ''useful phrase'' listed on the official event guide is ''Do you know the way to the red light district?'' (First on the list is ''Can I get a beer please?'') Certainly, Microsoft's big X05 show here this week was entertaining, but it was also serious business. New consoles from Nintendo and Sony won't arrive until next year, so Microsoft's Xbox 360 will be the first of the next generation of game machines to hit shelves when it comes out next month. Microsoft hopes to take an early insurmountable lead on its Japanese rivals.
10/6/2005	Microsoft to Introduce New Security Software for Windows	Microsoft will introduce a set of corporate products today that will move it more fully into competition with the leading makers of security software for Windows computers. The company will outline plans for a package of corporate security software and services called client protection technology, along with software for identity management and access for corporate customers. The services will go into limited testing later this year; Microsoft would not give details on general availability or pricing.
10/6/2005	Online Pioneer Sets Out to Shake Up TV	Jeremy Allaire has a long history of shaking up the established order as an Internet pioneer. Mr. Allaire was an architect of the evolution of Macromedia's Flash system into a video format that is now second only to Microsoft's Windows Media platform in popularity for delivering video on the Internet. Now, he has started a new company called Brightcove.
10/6/2005	Europe Names a Trustee To Monitor Microsoft	Eighteen months after finding Microsoft guilty of monopoly abuse, the European Commission has appointed a trustee to ensure that the company makes the changes called for in the ruling. Neil Barrett, a computer scientist at Cranfield University in Britain, will monitor Microsoft's compliance and report directly to the competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, Ms. Kroes said at a news conference.
10/6/2005	Microsoft Unveils Games For Its New Xbox 360	Trying to take an early lead in the race to dominate the next generation of video game systems, Microsoft has unveiled a broad range of richly detailed games that the company hopes will propel millions of consumers to buy its new Xbox 360 console. On Tuesday and Wednesday, more than 1,000 journalists, retailers and game industry executives at Microsoft's X05 game show here had the first public opportunity to play the games that will provide the 360's foundation. Sony and Nintendo, the two other major makers of game consoles, intend to introduce new systems next year. By introducing the 360 next month, Microsoft hopes to take an early lead. (A bare-bones model will cost $300 and a version with basic accessories will cost $400.)
10/5/2005	Google and Sun Announce a Joint Agreement	Google and Sun Microsystems announced a broad but vague agreement yesterday to develop and distribute each other's technology in a bid to expand their markets and challenge Microsoft's dominance of computer desktops. Under the agreement, Sun will include the Google toolbar as an option when consumers download the Java programming tool, a software program that is widely considered one of Sun's crown jewels. The deal is also expected to make it easier for customers to obtain OpenOffice, Sun's freely distributed office productivity suite that competes with Microsoft Office.
10/4/2005	More Show Than Games For Xbox 360	In the five months since Microsoft unveiled a prototype of its new video game machine, the Xbox 360, the company has tried to generate excitement by staging demonstrations of the console's ability to play music and display digital photographs and by trumpeting its online community features. Yet as Microsoft has tried to build buzz for the 360, the most important ingredient has largely been missing: games.
10/2/2005	What Do TiVo and the Mac Mini Have in Common?	TODAY'S theme is elegant underdogs: the devices or solutions that don't lead their markets but are in many ways more admirable than the ones that do. For years the Apple Macintosh has defined this category. Indeed, the Mac's business history illustrates important changes in the role of the tech also-ran. From the mid-1980's through the late 1990's -- a period that started with the widening use of Windows and ran through the widening use of the Internet -- the pressures toward standardization created not just market leaders but also all-dominating market leviathans. Consider word-processing software: through the 80's and early 90's, there were a dozen contenders. Now, for practical purposes, there is only Microsoft Word.
9/27/2005	How Microsoft and Palm Got Together Over Software	Microsoft's truce with Palm, its longtime rival in palmtop software, was forged with a rare agreement to allow Palm to tinker with the Windows Mobile software, the companies' leaders said here Monday. The details of the new relationship came as Microsoft and Palm unveiled a Windows version of Palm's popular line of cellphone-organizers, the Treo, in a combined effort to capture a market that has eluded them both: corporate customers.
9/27/2005	DVD Fight Intensifies: Microsoft and Intel to Back Toshiba Format	Microsoft and Intel are throwing their full weight behind one side in the long-running battle over the format for the next generation of high-definition DVD's. Today, the two companies will announce that they are backing the HD-DVD format developed by Toshiba over the Blu-ray standard championed by Sony, Matsushita Electric, Samsung and others. Microsoft announced in June that it would work with Toshiba to develop high-definition DVD players. Now, Microsoft and Intel say they will develop software and chips that will allow personal computers to play the next-generation DVD's from Toshiba.
9/26/2005	Microsoft Plans to Sell Search Ads Of Its Own	The Microsoft Corporation will unveil today its own system for selling Web advertising as it struggles to compete with Google and Yahoo in the expanding Web search business. The system, to be used by MSN, is meant to improve on those of Microsoft's rivals by allowing marketers to aim ads on Web search pages to users based on their sex, age or location. The move is part of Microsoft's broad response to the threat from Google, which is using its powerful advertising sales network to support an expanding range of free software products and Internet services. Last week, Microsoft announced a broad reorganization that placed MSN in the same group as its Windows operating system, indicating that it saw software delivered over the Internet -- and possibly paid for through advertising -- as central to its future.
9/24/2005	Palm Will Team With Microsoft for the Next Version of the Treo Organizer	Microsoft will achieve one of its longest-held ambitions on Monday when its rival Palm Computing plans to announce that it will use Microsoft's Windows Mobile software in a new version of its popular cellphone-organizer, the Treo. Verizon Wireless, which will market the phone, will join in the announcement at an event here, according to several people involved. Emphasizing the significance of the alliance for Microsoft, Bill Gates, its chairman, will be present.
9/21/2005	Microsoft Shuffles Leadership	Microsoft reshuffled its management team yesterday in an effort to make it more nimble as the company tries to lift its growth and compete with fast-moving rivals like Google. Under the plan, seven business units will be collapsed into three divisions, each led by an executive who will carry the title of president.
9/20/2005	Europe Considers New Charges Against Microsoft	Almost 18 months after the European Commission ruled that Microsoft had abused its dominance in the software market, Europe's antitrust authority is considering opening new cases against the company, Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner, said Monday. The commission ruling resulted in a fine of 497 million euros against Microsoft and an order to change the way it sells software in Europe. The changes have not formally taken effect yet and the ruling is under appeal at the European Court of First Instance.
9/18/2005	The Key to Google's $10 Million Man	IN the public tug of war over Kai-Fu Lee, a computer scientist at Microsoft who defected to Google, a Seattle judge ruled last week that Google can have him, but said he could not work on search and speech technologies, two of his specialties. Dr. Lee's case is striking not just because it highlights the intense rivalry that now exists between Google and Microsoft, but because two of the tech world's most powerful companies are going to such lengths to fight over one employee.
9/16/2005	Microsoft Said to Be in Talks on Forming Link to AOL	Microsoft and Time Warner have explored a variety of possible combinations of the MSN Internet portal with the America Online operation of Time Warner, including a merger of the two into a new company that would be jointly owned, according to several people involved in the talks. The discussions were initiated by Microsoft, which has Google, its new archrival, clearly in its sights. Microsoft is trying to focus its Internet operations on its developing Web search product rather than its Web portal and Internet access business, which it no longer sees as strategically important.
9/15/2005	Beating Rivals, Microsoft's Xbox 360 Is Expected Nov. 22	The Microsoft Corporation plans to announce today at the Tokyo Game Show that it will begin selling the Xbox 360, its new video game console, on Nov. 22. The release of the console will be the start of the transition to the next generation of game consoles from the top competitors in that market -- Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.
9/14/2005	Google Gains Researcher; Microsoft Wins Limits	Google and Microsoft each claimed victory on Tuesday in the latest round of their bitter court dispute over a top researcher's defection to Google. For Google, though, the victory claim was backed by one clear-cut result: the researcher, Kai-Fu Lee, will be at work there on Wednesday.
9/14/2005	Bill Gates Shows Next Windows	Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief software architect, gave software developers a preview of the next version of the Windows operating system yesterday in an effort to build support and enthusiasm for the new program. The commercial release of the program, known as Windows Vista, is not expected for another year, but Mr. Gates and legions of Microsoft employees are already working with developers to create software applications that will work with the new Windows.
9/8/2005	A Gull's Wing For Flying Fingers	A new keyboard from Microsoft is designed for the millions of finger-stressed computer users worldwide. The Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, released this week, splits the keys into two sections as it bubbles up and out in a convex gullwing design. Dan Odell, Microsoft's hardware ergonomist, said the unusual shape put the keys closer to the fingers, reducing reach and unnecessary motion while encouraging a more natural and comfortable typing position. The $65 keyboard has 108 keys, not including a top row of dedicated shortcut keys, and it has some useful extras, like back and forward buttons for Web browser navigation and a ''slider'' that sits between the ''g'' and the ''h'' keys and controls the zoom function of the program running in the foreground. It can be used, for example, to zoom in on a picture in Photoshop or make the font size larger in Internet Explorer.
9/8/2005	Microsoft Sues to Keep Data Secret	Microsoft said on Wednesday that it had filed a new lawsuit against the European Commission, challenging the commission's order that it divulge technical information that rivals need to create programs that work well with Microsoft software. Microsoft had already appealed the commission's overall ruling in 2004 that the company had abused its dominance of its Windows operating system. The commission also fined the company 497 million euros ($617 million) and ordered it to change the way it conducted business to restore competition to the market.
9/8/2005	Q & A	Opening Windows On a Macintosh Q .I have a Macintosh and want to run .exe files on it, but it will not open them. Is there a Mac program that will let me play the files? A. The extension .exe stands for executable file, and it is typically the file type used by programs written to run on Windows and DOS systems. When a computer runs a program for you, it is ''executing the file.'' This can be a good thing for programs you want to use, but if you see .exe files you weren't expecting attached to e-mail messages, be wary, as computer viruses can also be executable files. Software programs written specifically for Windows hardware usually won't run on current Macintosh machines without special software. Programs like Virtual PC, however, let you mimic a Windows system on your Mac. You can run most software written for Windows and use some networking functions and hardware devices designed for the PC.
9/7/2005	Microsoft Eyes a Business Niche	Microsoft said yesterday that it planned to announce today a new strategy for selling software to medium-size business, including a revamped collection of programs that would handle specific jobs. The new software programs will be released starting this fall and through next year. Microsoft long ago identified midsize businesses as growth opportunities, but today's announcement indicates that the company sees this market as increasingly important.
9/1/2005	Corrections	An article in Business Day on July 29 about a briefing for financial analysts by Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, regarding the company's growth prospects recounted one remark incorrectly. (An article in Sunday Business this week about investing in Microsoft repeated the error.) Mr. Ballmer said he had asked Microsoft employees generally -- not its executives -- whether they were buying the company's stock, and had found no takers. A Microsoft spokesman brought the error to a reporter's attention on Sunday.
8/31/2005	Microsoft to Acquire Teleo, An Internet Phone Company	Microsoft is expected to announce today that it is acquiring a San Francisco-based Internet phone company, Teleo, to add features to its MSN Internet portal service. The announcement follows moves last week by Google and Skype, a Luxembourg-based Internet voice company, to take business away from traditional phone companies. Competition for digital calling -- from technology companies like these as well as from big cable television and satellite firms -- could make prices more attractive to many consumers who have shied away from so-called voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP, service.
8/28/2005	It's Just More Fun Being a Growth Stock	SOME very savvy people may be badly misjudging the prospects for Microsoft's common stock. When Steven A. Ballmer, the company's chief executive, polled a group of his fellow Microsoft executives recently about whether they were buying the company's shares, he said, nobody raised a hand.
8/25/2005	Google Gets Better. What's Up With That?	EVER heard the old joke about the two psychiatrists who pass in a hallway? One says, ''Hello there.'' The other thinks, ''I wonder what he meant by that?'' In high-tech circles, that's pretty much what people are saying about Google these days. If you hadn't noticed, Google is no longer just an Internet search tool; it's now a full-blown software company. It develops elegant, efficient software programs -- and then gives them away. In today's culture of cynicism, such generosity and software excellence seems highly suspicious; surely it's all a smokescreen for a darker, larger plot to suck us all in. What, exactly, is Google up to?
8/25/2005	Q & A	Seeking the Source Of Printer Problems Q. Ever since my daughter used my Windows XP computer, I haven't been able to print from Microsoft Word. How can I fix this problem? A. Any number of things can cause printing problems, from a loose or unplugged printer cable to scrambled software settings, but asking your daughter what she did on the computer when she was using it might be a good place to start. If she installed any software or games (either on purpose or inadvertently), the new programs could have changed your computer's settings.
8/24/2005	Relax, Bill Gates; It's Google's Turn as the Villain	For years, Silicon Valley hungered for a company mighty enough to best Microsoft. Now it has one such contender: the phenomenally successful Google. But instead of embracing Google as one of their own, many in Silicon Valley are skittish about its size and power. They fret that the very strengths that made Google a search-engine phenomenon are distancing it from the entrepreneurial culture that produced it -- and even transforming it into a threat.
8/20/2005	Taking the Temperature of the Creative Body	In the video game world, huge annual conventions like the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles and the Tokyo Game Show naturally attract lots of attention. But it is both easier and more accurate to take the industry's true temperature at small private gatherings like a conference organized by the Ziff Davis publishing company in northern California last week. The roughly 100 invitees sat through a light schedule of formal presentations and talks, but much of the gathering's real substance emerged over the various dinners and rounds of cocktails, where one could see senior executives from rivals like Nintendo and Microsoft chatting amicably or a major player like Paul Eibeler, the chief executive of Take-Two, having a glass of wine with Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Entertainment Software Association. I'm sure the golf outing was great, too, but I didn't play.
8/17/2005	Virus Attacks Windows Computers At Companies	A handful of digital worms that exploit vulnerabilities in some Microsoft Windows computers spread on Tuesday, hindering Internet access at some major companies. The worms, called Zotob and Rbot, and variants of them, started emerging Saturday, computer security specialists said, and continued to propagate as corporate networks came to life at the beginning of the week.
8/15/2005	Even in Vain, Swatting Spammers Feels Good	IT seemed a banner week for the antispam crusade. Last Tuesday, Microsoft announced that Scott Richter, whose company in Colorado, OptInRealBig.com, was considered by antispam activists to be one of the world's most prolific junk e-mail operations, had agreed to settle a lawsuit with the company for $7 million.
8/15/2005	In Silicon Valley, a Debate Over the Size of the Web	How big is the World Wide Web? Many Internet engineers consider that query one of those imponderable philosophical questions, like how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. But the question about the size of the Web came under intense debate last week after Yahoo announced at an Internet search engine conference in Santa Clara, Calif., that its search engine index -- an accounting of the number of documents that can be located from its databases -- had reached 19.2 billion.
8/7/2005	Britney to Rent, Lease or Buy	THE Internet has been described, by enthusiasts, as a global conversation, a giant encyclopedia or a 24-hour news service -- and by detractors as the world's most technologically advanced time waster. What peeves record-company executives, however, is how many people see it as a free music store. A Supreme Court decision at the end of June, however, may eventually put an ''Out of Business'' sign on that store. In MGM Studios v. Grokster, the court found that the makers of software like Grokster, which lets Internet users freely browse and copy songs from one another, can be sued for their role in encouraging copyright infringement. The record companies' lawyers now have a green light to try to shut down the file-swapping services.
8/7/2005	The Xbox Auteurs	Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the ''team versus team'' mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. ''Halo is like crack,'' Burns recalls thinking. ''I could play it until I die.''
8/7/2005	Now, if My Software Only Had a Brain	THIS is one more chapter in a continuing story: the quest for intelligent software. Soon after I stored my first file on my first computer, I began dreaming of how I could ''save time'' through some automatic means of organizing the data I was salting away. That was back in the 70's, and the computer was the Processor Technology SOL-20, an elegant antique that was housed, like a Viennese music box, in a burled walnut case.
8/5/2005	Microsoft Shops at Wal-Mart for an Operating Chief	Microsoft plucked its new chief operating officer yesterday from Wal-Mart, a kindred corporate giant that shares the challenge of finding new growth despite its size and market dominance. The executive, Kevin Turner, 40, had a 19-year career at Wal-Mart, where he rose quickly through the management ranks to become the retailer's chief information officer and, most recently, the chief executive of Sam's Club, the company's warehouse club division.
8/3/2005	Where's Johnny? Smart Cards and Satellites Help Keep Track	AS the wheels on the bus go round and round, Norm Foust is watching. Mr. Foust, transportation director for the Metropolitan School District of Washington Township in Indianapolis, has equipped his 120-bus fleet with sensors and Global Positioning System units that follow nearly every move the bus drivers make.
8/3/2005	From Early On, Multimedia Rules	LAST spring, when Anya Higman and Jonathan Goodell had to prepare a presentation on an African country for their sixth-grade class at the Lowell School in Washington, they didn't rush off to the store for poster board, photo corners and stencils as generations of students before them had done. Instead, they turned to a popular Microsoft graphics program more commonly used by most of their parents: PowerPoint. It wasn't that Anya, 12, and Jonathan, 13, were trying to improve their grade on the project by adding the bells and whistles of a slick PowerPoint presentation. The assignment, which they each worked on with a partner, required that they use the software and have at least 25 slides. For many of the students, the project was second nature. The year before, they were given an assignment to create a tour of Washington using either PowerPoint or video.
7/27/2005	Sun Earnings Beat Forecasts, But Sales Continue to Slip	Sun Microsystems reported earnings on Tuesday that outpaced Wall Street expectations for the quarter. But the company's revenue continued to fall, indicating that the computer maker has yet to achieve a turnaround. One of the highest fliers of the dot-com boom, Sun's revenue has collapsed in the last five years and it has been hunting for a path to growth while waiting for a rebound in demand among its biggest corporate customers.
7/23/2005	New Version Of Windows Coming in '06	Microsoft said yesterday that the new version of its Windows operating system would be named Vista and available for commercial release in late 2006. The first of two test versions of the program will be made available to corporate technology managers on Aug. 3, the company said. The new version has been known as Longhorn since development began more than four years ago.
7/22/2005	Strong PC Sales Help Microsoft Beat Earnings Estimates	Microsoft reported yesterday that earnings rose nearly 38 percent in the fourth quarter helped by a tax benefit and strong demand for personal computers. Sales largely met Wall Street's goals. The company, the largest maker of software for personal computers, had net income of $3.7 billion, or 34 cents a share, up from $2.69 billion, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.
7/21/2005	Circuits; Secrets to Good Hard-Drive Hygiene	My cousin Steven Cristol should enter the lottery: he's already beaten seemingly impossible odds by enduring ''seven mechanical hard drive failures in five computers,'' as he describes it. One drive failure is unsurprising, but usually after several years of use. Two failures are improbable. Seven puts us into an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.''
7/20/2005	Microsoft Sues Over Google's Hiring of a Former Executive	Microsoft filed a lawsuit against Google on Tuesday asserting that Google hired away a Microsoft executive in violation of a clause in the executive's contract that precludes him for working for a competitor. The lawsuit came one day after Kai-Fu Lee, 43, an expert in speech recognition and an accomplished engineer, told Microsoft officials he was leaving his position as vice president of the interactive services division to take over as head of Google's fledgling operations in China.
7/18/2005	Marrying Maps to Data for a New Web Service	In 1991, David Gelernter, a computer scientist at Yale, proposed using software to create a computer simulation of the physical world, making it possible to map everything from traffic flow and building layouts to sales and currency data on a computer screen. Mr. Gelernter's idea came a step closer to reality in the last few weeks when both Google and Yahoo published documentation making it significantly easier for programmers to link virtually any kind of Internet data to Web-based maps and, in Google's case, satellite imagery.
7/15/2005	Microsoft Joins Marvel in Online Game Deal	Batman and Spider-Man have been rivals for decades. Now they will square off in the online gaming arena. Expanding the video game wars to new fronts, Microsoft announced a deal with Marvel Enterprises yesterday to develop an advanced online game based on Marvel's well-known cast of comic book characters.
7/14/2005	Q & A	Going to School By Way of the Net Q. What is involved in taking a college course online? A. Many colleges and universities have distance-learning programs that let you take courses over the Internet, but the experience will vary, depending on the class and the technology used by the school. Some courses may require nothing more than sending in papers written in Microsoft Word by e-mail or copying them onto a special folder on one of the school's file servers, while a computer-science course may require that you install special software on your computer to use for the class.
7/4/2005	Once Again, Microsoft Faces Antitrust Suit	Microsoft's efforts to extricate itself from antitrust disputes received another setback last week when the founder of the Go Corporation, a maker of a portable computer operating system in the 1990's, filed suit in federal and state courts last Wednesday. The lawsuits, which accuse Microsoft of attempting to ''kill'' Go in the early 1990's, were filed two days before Microsoft announced a settlement with I.B.M. for $775 million in cash and a $75 million software credit related to its anticompetitive actions in undermining OS/2, a desktop computing operating system pursued by the two companies in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
7/2/2005	Microsoft To Pay I.B.M. $775 Million In Settlement	Microsoft agreed on Friday to pay I.B.M. $775 million to settle claims growing out of the antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against Microsoft in 1995. I.B.M. will also receive a $75 million credit toward the use of Microsoft software. The settlement is one of the largest in a series of settlements Microsoft has struck in its effort to resolve its legal troubles after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court in Washington ruled in 2000 that it had engaged in anticompetitive practices.
6/30/2005	Q & A	A System for Files And Security Q. I have noticed that some Windows XP features won't work unless your computer uses the ''NTFS'' format. What is this? A. NTFS stands for the NT File System. A file system is the part of the computer's operating system that handles basic organizational chores, like how files are named and stored. Many of Microsoft's business-oriented operating systems use the NTFS format, including Windows XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and Windows NT. There are several file systems besides NTFS, including FAT (File Allocation Table) and FAT32, often used by Linux and older versions of the Windows operating system, and HFS Plus (Hierarchical File System), used by Macintosh computers and Mac-formatted iPods.
6/30/2005	Microsoft Said to Be in Talks To Buy Adware Developer	For the last two weeks, Microsoft has been in talks to buy a private Silicon Valley company, a move that underscores just how eager Microsoft is to catch up with Google, the search and advertising giant. The company that Microsoft has pursued is controversial: Claria, an adware marketer formerly called Gator, and best known for its pop-up ads and software that tracks people visiting Web sites. The Gator adware has frequently been denounced by privacy advocates for its intrusiveness.
6/28/2005	Microsoft and Toshiba Cut Research Deal	Microsoft and Toshiba said Monday that they would work together to develop next-generation DVD players, heating up a race between competing technologies for DVD's. The companies aim to develop high-definition DVD players that would use software from Microsoft and hardware from Toshiba, the companies said.
6/25/2005	Bill Gates as Anthropologist	MARGARET MEAD. Louis Leakey. Bill Gates? Grouping the founder of Microsoft among great anthropologists is not as strange as it first sounds, according to the current issue of Fortune Small Business.
6/23/2005	Microsoft Will Pay Legal Costs If Technology Partners Are Sued	Microsoft plans to announce today that it will pay the legal costs for any personal computer maker or software company that may be sued over patents, trademarks or trade secrets, based on claims against it. The move by Microsoft is the latest step in the computer industry to deal with a rising number of intellectual property lawsuits against software makers and the companies who distribute their technology.
6/21/2005	Promotion at Microsoft	Microsoft promoted its European chief, Jean-Philippe Courtois, on Monday, giving him leadership of all the company's marketing, sales and services business outside North America. Mr. Courtois, 44, a native of France, will have the title of president of Microsoft International, which puts him in charge of more than 14,000 employees. He is to retain his post as a senior vice president of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash.
6/16/2005	Q & A	Getting Movies When You Want Q. I've been hearing a lot about video-on-demand technology with cable television but I'm clueless as to how it actually works. Is this the same thing as the old pay-per-view, except with a different name? A. Both video-on-demand and pay-per-view are services for delivering specialized or premium content like commercial-free movies, and many cable television companies offer them. But the two services use different technology to bring movies to the small screen. Movies featured on pay-per-view cable channels typically start at preordained times as scheduled by your cable television provider. When you order and pay for a film showing on a pay-per-view channel through your provider, the cable company unscrambles the channel at the time your selected movie is playing so you can watch it.
6/12/2005	Redoing The Math Of an Index	WITH the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 1.1 percent, the stock market's performance has been disappointing this year. Last year, of course, was better, and with some common-sense adjustments to the calculations by Standard & Poor's, it was better still. S.&P. reported a total return of 10.88 percent, including dividends, for the 500-stock index in 2004. A good argument can be made for raising that figure to 11.23 percent.
6/10/2005	Hollywood Hardball; Microsoft Finds It's Tough to Sell a Video Game as a Film	Hollywood does not like it when outsiders play certain games. That was the message sent this week to Microsoft and its agents at the Creative Artists Agency by movie studios outraged at the aggressive proposal being shopped for the film version of the popular Xbox video game Halo.
6/7/2005	Europe and Microsoft in Accord on Competition Rules	The competition commissioner of Europe, Neelie Kroes, has agreed to exclude open-source developers, who distribute their software free, from the benefits of the antitrust ruling last year against Microsoft -- but only for the time being. After more than a year of wrangling, the European Commission and Microsoft appeared on Monday to have reached agreement on how to meet Europe's competition standards. In March 2004, Microsoft was fined 497 million euros (about $613 million at the time) for monopolistic practices, and ordered to share details of its Windows operating system with rival software makers, including developers of open-source software. Sharing those details would allow Microsoft's competitors to build programs that could work with Windows.
6/7/2005	Microsoft Ordered to Pay Inventor $8.9 Million in Patent Case	Microsoft was told by a jury to pay a Guatemalan inventor $8.96 million for infringing a patent that links its Access and Excel programs through a single spreadsheet. The jury, in United States District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., ruled that Microsoft had used technology patented by Carlos Amado in some versions of Access, said Vincent Belusko, a lawyer for Mr. Amado.
5/29/2005	The Microsoft Millionaires Come of Age	FIVE years ago, Chris Peters was a former programmer who had made a fortune from his Microsoft stock options. Then he learned that the Professional Bowlers Association was for sale. Undeterred by his lack of experience in sports, broadcasting or any other directly relevant business, he recruited some friends as investors and bought the league. ''I was not very athletic'' as a child, Mr. Peters said by way of explaining his new career, ''but I always loved bowling with my father.''
5/25/2005	A Front-Runner Without a Race	The path to the top at Microsoft is not for the timid. Anyone hoping to make the ascent must be able to match wits with two of the most formidable and combative intellects in corporate America: Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, and Steven A. Ballmer, its chief executive. Eric Rudder, a senior vice president, demonstrated that skill not long after he arrived at Microsoft. In 1992, Mr. Rudder, then 25, had a confrontation with Mr. Gates, recalled Brad Silverberg, a former senior Microsoft executive. The dispute centered on some now-forgotten technical matter in the Windows desktop operating system.
5/24/2005	Take That, Google: Bill Gates Struts Microsoft's New Search Stuff	Bill Gates used his appearance at an industry conference here Monday to offer Microsoft's response to Google's latest online offerings, incorporating satellite imagery into location-based search results and introducing a new customizable MSN ''start'' page. Mr. Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chief software architect, also said that he was skeptical of Google's ability to maintain its dominance in the search marketplace indefinitely. Increasingly, he asserted, that competition will revolve around new technologies and take place in new arenas, like searching local information, where Google is less dominant than in Web searching.
5/24/2005	Microsoft Must Comply With a Ruling Or Face Fines	Microsoft has until the middle of next week to comply with the European Commission's antitrust ruling, or face daily fines of up to $5 million, Europe's competition monitor said Monday. The European Commission ruled in March 2004 that Microsoft had abused its dominant position in the European software market. The company paid a 497 million euro fine last summer, but it has not acted on two orders to change its business practices.
5/23/2005	A Video Match: The Nintendogs vs. Gangs, Thugs and Wars	At the Electronics Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles last week, the demonstration booth for Nintendo seemed like an island of innocence amid the retorts of digitized gunfire. While most game publishers showed sequels, sports simulations and shooting games based on grim tropes such as gang violence and World War II, Nintendo was promoting, among other games, Nintendogs. It lets players raise and train virtual pets on the Nintendo DS, the dual-screen hand-held game machine released last year.
5/21/2005	Google This: Is Microsoft Still a Bully?	NOT long ago, I went to Washington for a dinner given by a friend. She wanted to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the end of the Microsoft antitrust trial, which she had covered for a news agency and I had covered for Fortune magazine. In all, about 10 of us made it to the dinner, and it wasn't long before we were regaling one another about the ''good old days'' of the trial -- laughing at the way Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson used to roll his eyes at Microsoft's witnesses, and recalling how the superlawyer David Boies, whose daily skewering of Microsoft gave the trial most of its entertainment value, would put straws in his jacket pocket when he went out drinking with us so he could keep track of how many drinks he had.
5/19/2005	A New Spin On a Palmtop (Or Inside It)	FOR several years, technology pundits have predicted the death of the palmtop computer. ''This is the cellphone age,'' they say. ''Who's going to carry around a separate gadget just to look up names and numbers?'' But for the same several years, PalmOne (formerly Palm Computing) has had the same answer: ''We're not dead yet!''
5/19/2005	Got Game? Accessorize It	For years, the many companies creating video game accessories, like joysticks and game pads, were widely seen as little more than the foam on the multibillion-dollar wave of the video game industry. But as the video game market matures, its prime movers, including Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, are striving harder to make electronic entertainment more mainstream. Partly as a result, those special gaming extras -- from stylish carrying cases to snap-on video screens -- are gaining new prominence.
5/17/2005	Sony Unveils Details About PlayStation 3	Bidding to maintain its commanding lead in the video game console business, Sony revealed details of its next-generation product, PlayStation 3, on Monday, promising greatly enhanced graphic effects and heightened realism. It will compete against new consoles from Microsoft and Nintendo. The PlayStation 3 will be able to render in real time complex movielike animations that previously took hours to create, Sony executives said. It will also be able to display images at a high-definition resolution equivalent to that of digital projectors in movie theaters, they said.
5/16/2005	HDTV Is a New Reality for Game Developers	High-definition television has not yet made it into many American homes, but it is certainly high in the minds of the video game industry as it gets ready for its major annual trade show here this week. Games created for two next-generation consoles -- the Xbox 360 from Microsoft and the PlayStation 3 from Sony -- will display video in wide-screen high-definition format if the console is connected to a high-definition TV. Only Nintendo's entry, code-named Revolution, will not cater to HDTV's.
5/14/2005	2 Giants Agree to Cross-License Some Patents	Microsoft and Toshiba have signed an agreement to cross-license their patents on computer software and digital consumer electronics, the companies said Friday. The pact, which was signed last month, could allow the companies to speed development of new televisions, DVD recorders and other consumer electronics devices with more computerlike features. The companies declined, however, to comment on what specific products might emerge from their agreement.
5/14/2005	Compatibility, And Not Just In Products	There were no colorful references to ''Windows hairballs'' or descriptions of the Microsoft executive team as ''Beavis and Butthead,'' and the message was a relatively drab pronouncement about interchangeable software plumbing for corporate computing customers. But the event was notable all the same. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, and his counterpart and onetime archenemy at Sun Microsystems, Scott McNealy, took the stage in a hotel conference room here today to report on their efforts to make their software programs communicate. The collaboration was announced a year ago in the wake of the landmark settlement to Sun's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
5/13/2005	In Console Wars, Xbox Is Latest to Rearm	Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season.
5/13/2005	Microsoft Says It Will Offer Virus Defense	Microsoft said Thursday that it would enter the consumer antivirus business as part of a subscription service that it will offer next year. Microsoft said a companywide trial of the service, called Windows OneCare, would begin next week. The service will include virus and spyware protection as well as PC backup and performance-enhancing functions for Windows PC's.
5/12/2005	A Robot for the Home, Brains Not Included	Robotics has always been an esoteric and expensive pursuit, with few avenues for the home dabbler to create a robot that can venture around the house or out into the world. The White Box Robotics Model 914 PC-BOT, however, aims to change that. The PC-BOT ($1,199, whiteboxrobotics.com) is essentially a PC case on wheels. The chassis is pressed steel, and the basic PC-BOT includes two 12-volt rechargeable batteries as well as a Webcam, microphone and object-avoidance sensors. It has rubber drive wheels with independent suspension.
5/9/2005	Chip Maker Develops Denser Storage Method	The maker of a novel computer memory chip has developed a new generation of its technology, pushing forward in the quest for chips that are smaller and denser, and thus less expensive for use in consumer electronics. The company, Matrix Semiconductor of Santa Clara, Calif., is expected to announce on Tuesday that its approach -- storing data in an array of circuits stacked in four levels -- had yielded one-gigabit chips that are 10 percent smaller than its previous version and have twice the memory of the original 512-megabit chips.
5/7/2005	In a Reverse, Microsoft Says It Supports Gay Rights Bill	Microsoft, faced with unrelenting criticism from employees and gay rights groups over its decision to abandon support of a gay rights bill in Washington state, reversed course again yesterday and announced that it was now in support of the bill. Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive, announced the reversal in an e-mail message sent to 35,000 employees in the United States. ''After looking at the question from all sides, I've concluded that diversity in the workplace is such an important issue for our business that it should be included in our legislative agenda,'' Mr. Ballmer said.
5/5/2005	CIRCUITS: Q & A	Programs That Start When XP Does Q. My Windows XP machine takes forever to start up. How can I tell what programs are loading during the start-up process? A. One way to sneak a peek at what programs start up when you turn on your computer is to use the System Configuration Utility that comes with Windows XP. To get to it, go to the Start menu and select Run. In the Run box, type ''msconfig'' (without the quotation marks) to start the utility. Click the Startup tab in the System Configuration box to see the list of programs that open when Windows starts up, along with check boxes to turn each program off or on during the next start-up.
5/5/2005	Microsoft to Lease Some Ideas to Start-Ups	Microsoft said yesterday that it would begin to license its home-grown ideas to venture capital firms and entrepreneurs. The move, the company said, is an effort to open its technology to outsiders and exploit its store of intellectual property. The new program, called Microsoft Intellectual Property Ventures, is intended to foster more amicable relations between the big software company and start-up companies, which have often regarded Microsoft as a threat.
5/4/2005	After Looking Elsewhere, Microsoft Will Expand at Home	After years of indecision on whether to build a satellite campus 15 miles away in Seattle or in nearby Issaquah, the Microsoft Corporation has pledged to keep its growing empire in this community, where it has flourished since 1985. Its already sprawling 80-building headquarters complex is expected to expand by 2.2 million square feet. This summer, the company will start design work on two office buildings that will have a total of more than 500,000 square feet when software workers move in by the fall of 2007. These are the first of 13 similar buildings and 8 garages that Microsoft plans to build within 10 to 20 years. The company also plans to demolish and rebuild 600,000 square feet of older buildings that lack the power and cooling capacity needed for modern computer equipment.
5/2/2005	A Megachurch's Leader Says Microsoft Is No Match	Before he became a born-again Christian and later a rising national star in the world of black evangelical ministers, the Rev. Ken Hutcherson started playing football because, he said, it was the best way he could think of to ''hurt white people.'' Dr. Hutcherson, a husky former linebacker for three National Football League teams who goes fishing with Rush Limbaugh and raises Rottweilers (''the bigger, the meaner, the better,'' he said of his pets), does not talk that way anymore about whites, saying his conversion to Christianity as a teenager changed all that. And a majority of the 3,500 members of his megachurch, which is based in this tidy Seattle suburb and high-tech hub, is white, as is his wife.
4/29/2005	The Strange Pleasure of Upgrading Software	Like many Apple computer users, I'm in a pleasant state of expectation. I've ordered Apple's updated operating system, but it hasn't yet arrived. I have housecleaning to do before I can install it: deleting dead programs in my applications folder, for instance, and backing up my hard drive. Then will come the almost visceral pleasure of installing new software. This is one of the most pleasant tasks I know, vastly easier than straightening up the barn or taking the truck in for service. Somewhere at home I have the floppy disks of many previous upgrades, including versions of MS-DOS -- the first Microsoft operating system -- that date from the early 1980's. They are reminders of how strange the idea of software seemed to me at the time. It did not occur to me then that such strangeness was part of living in a hardware world.
4/29/2005	Microsoft Earnings Meet Expectations Despite Modest Sales	Microsoft reported yesterday that its quarterly sales increased a modest 5 percent, somewhat below Wall Street's expectations, pointing to the challenge the company faces as growth slows in its big desktop software business. But Microsoft's profits met analysts' expectations, and the company's forecast for sales and earnings in its 2006 fiscal year, beginning in July, was higher than most analysts' previous estimates. In fiscal 2006, Microsoft said that it expected its revenues to grow 9 percent to 11 percent, in the range of $43.3 billion to $44.1 billion.
4/28/2005	For High-Definition Games, A Wide-Screen Monitor to Match	When high-definition technology is incorporated not just into television programs but into video games as well, it must be reaching a new level. Anticipating Microsoft's next-generation Xbox and several new games in high definition, to be unveiled in May, Samsung is introducing a new line of wide-screen, liquid-crystal-display HDTV sets that it will promote in a joint effort with Microsoft.
4/28/2005	Apple's Tiger May Even Have PC Owners Longing for a Mac to Put It In	IF anyone considers tomorrow a special day at all, it's probably because it's Friday, or because ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' movie opens, or because it's Uma Thurman's birthday. But for one particular group of 25 million computer owners, April 29 is a much bigger deal. It's the day Apple releases Mac OS X 10.4, nicknamed Tiger -- the latest version of the software suite that makes up the Macintosh operating system.
4/28/2005	European Antitrust Official Chastises Microsoft's Chief	Was it a courtesy call or a charm offensive? Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, met with Europe's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, on Tuesday evening, only to be told that Microsoft must comply with Europe's antitrust ruling ''urgently and in full,'' her spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said Wednesday.
4/27/2005	Microsoft Weighs Reversal On Gay Rights, Gates Says	Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, has indicated he may reconsider his company's decision not to support a Washington State gay rights bill amid the growing firestorm inside and outside the company that exploded after the recent disclosure that Microsoft had changed its position on the bill. In an interview with The Seattle Times on Monday, Mr. Gates, who rarely grants interviews and declined through a spokesman Tuesday to grant one to The New York Times, indicated that he was surprised by the backlash to the company's turnaround on the legislation. He also suggested that Microsoft, which had been known for decades as a corporate leader on gay rights and had supported the bill in previous years, might change course next year because of the controversy.
4/26/2005	Microsoft Releases Software For 64-Bit Computer Systems	Microsoft announced yesterday that it would begin selling new versions of its Windows operating system that take full advantage of high-performance computers that run 64-bit processors. The new programs, called Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition, are available for servers that use 64-bit chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, and offer higher performance than systems based on the widely used 32-bit chips.
4/25/2005	At Microsoft, a Smart Guy Has His Hands Full With the Smart Phone Business	With Windows-powered mobile devices lagging behind the Palms and BlackBerrys of the world, the Microsoft Corporation has brought an electrical engineer from China -- a master of the strategy game Go -- to put them back in the race. He is Ya-Qin Zhang (pronounced yah-CHEEN jong), 39, an experienced computer systems researcher who helped start Microsoft's Beijing research laboratory in 1999. He was tapped in January 2004 to come to Redmond, where Microsoft is based, to lead the turnaround of the Windows Mobile software business, which has hemorrhaged money for years.
4/24/2005	Microsoft C.E.O. Explains Reversal on Gay Rights Bill	The chief executive of Microsoft, Steven A. Ballmer, sent what company officials described as an unusual e-mail message on Friday evening to roughly 35,000 employees in the United States, defending Microsoft's widely criticized decision not to support an antidiscrimination bill for gay people in Washington State this year. The e-mail message came as company officials, inundated by internal messages from angry employees, withering attacks on the Web and biting criticism from gay rights groups, sought to quell rancor following the disclosure this week that the company, which had supported the bill in past years, did not do so this year. Critics argue that the decision resulted from pressure from a prominent local evangelical Christian church.
4/22/2005	Microsoft Comes Under Fire For Reversal on Gay Rights Bill	The Microsoft Corporation, at the forefront of corporate gay rights for decades, is coming under fire from gay rights groups, politicians and its own employees for withdrawing its support for a state bill that would have barred discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Many of the critics accused the company of bowing to pressure from a prominent evangelical church in Redmond, Wash., located a few blocks from Microsoft's sprawling headquarters.
4/21/2005	With a PC's Power, That's Entertainment	Personal computers increasingly fill home entertainment needs. And why not? They are already the repositories for digital photos, music and video collections. With an attached TV or radio tuner and digital video recorder and encoder, they can replace nearly every entertainment device in the house. But the demands placed on machines to store large video files and process them quickly can be too much for standard home computers.
4/19/2005	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Wins Dismissal Of Lawsuit	A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Los Angeles, San Francisco and other California municipalities accusing Microsoft of overcharging them for Windows software. Judge J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court in Baltimore granted Microsoft's request to dismiss the case, which was filed last year after a series of settlements by Microsoft to resolve consumer antitrust suits in 14 states. The judge said the cities could file an amended complaint. The lawsuit filed by six California municipalities sought to represent all government agencies in the state. Microsoft settled a California consumer suit that made similar legal claims. Government entities were excluded from that $1.1 billion settlement. Judge Motz said the cities lacked standing to sue Microsoft under unfair competition laws because only individuals can sue under those laws. As for the cities' antitrust claims, Judge Motz said they could only sue for claims going back four years. The cities had sued for conduct going back more than 15 years. Eugene Crew, a lawyer representing the California cities, did not return a message left on voice mail.
4/18/2005	Microsoft Promotes XP Operating System	Microsoft plans to begin a worldwide campaign today to promote the Windows XP operating system, carrying the assertive theme ''Start something.'' The campaign, which Microsoft said would be its largest and longest yet, will run 15 months and appear in 11 countries, including the United States, France, Germany, India and Japan. The effort will include 51 television commercials, 39 print ads and 250 online ads.
4/15/2005	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Answers Europe's Inquiry	The European Commission said yesterday that Microsoft had replied to a letter from Europe's top antitrust official, the competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, three days after a deadline for its response expired. Ms. Kroes asked for the company's feedback concerning the appointment of a group of trustees with knowledge of the software industry to monitor Microsoft's compliance with last year's antitrust ruling. The trustees have not yet been appointed and the remedies the commission imposed on Microsoft a year ago have still not taken effect. The content of the letter was not disclosed. Paul Meller (NYT)
4/14/2005	Microsoft and Europeans Argue Over Ruling	A year and a month after the European Union's landmark antitrust ruling against Microsoft, the software company has still not carried out either of the resulting orders, and this week the two sides argued over when a progress report might be forthcoming. The European commissioner for competition, Neelie Kroes, wrote to Microsoft last month requesting information on how the company would comply with the antitrust ruling. The deadline for a response was Monday, but two days later she has still received no reply, European officials said.
4/12/2005	Microsoft Suits Accuse 8 of Selling Fake Software	Microsoft says it has filed eight lawsuits in seven states against software resellers and system builders, accusing them of distributing counterfeit and unlicensed computer programs. The federal lawsuits stem from a test purchase program begun in 1997, the company said yesterday. Under that program, Microsoft said, it bought software and computer systems to test their authenticity.
4/10/2005	Will the Next Version of Windows Be Worth the Wait?	TEN years ago, Microsoft unveiled Windows 95 in a way that suggested that the product's arrival was no less momentous than when humans stood upright for the first time. The company spent about $200 million introducing the operating system. That paid for festivities on the Microsoft campus (with Jay Leno as M.C.), rights to use the Rolling Stones song ''Start Me Up'' in a global advertising campaign and permission to bathe the Empire State Building at night with the Windows logo. It also loaded The Times of London with Windows 95 advertising that day, making the newspaper a one-day freebie, a first in its 307 years. What was remarkable about the Windows 95 introduction was the acquiescence of customers, who participated so willingly in the spectacle. Microsoft arranged for retail outlets to open at midnight on the day the system would first be available, a stunt that proved as irresistible as klieg lights at a Hollywood premiere. One chain counted some 50,000 people lined up at its stores across the country.
4/7/2005	Add-On Allows Firefox Browser Users To Maintain an Archive of Web Pages	Web site content often changes, moves or disappears, but archiving tools can help you save and manage collections of Web pages that you want to keep permanently or peruse offline. ScrapBook, a free add-on to the Firefox browser (which is available as a download at www.mozilla.org), lets you archive Web pages about as simply as creating bookmarks.
4/7/2005	CIRCUITS: Q & A	Maximizing the Life Of a Mac's Battery Q. I use my PowerBook G4 at home and on the road, and I would like to maximize the life of its rechargeable battery. Is it best to leave it plugged into a power source at home, or to leave it unplugged so it can discharge and then recharge it as necessary? A. Apple Computer does not recommend leaving the PowerBook plugged in all the time with its lithium-ion battery connected because the internal chemistry can stagnate, which may shorten battery life. Unplugging the laptop and working from the battery once a month or so helps to discharge the stored energy and gets those electrons moving. The company also recommends that you calibrate your laptop's battery every few months. Laptop batteries contain microprocessors that tell the computer how much of a charge is left, but they can get out of sync. This causes the computer to give incorrect information about the charge status. Calibration helps the battery and computer communicate more accurately.
3/31/2005	Live Large With a Wide-Screen Wall Entertainment PC System for All of Your Media	Windows Media Center PC's have taken a stab at combining digital movies, music, television and computing on the desktop, but now an all-in-one multimedia system aims to bring it all to your living room wall. The Tek Panel 460 is a Windows XP computer that also happens to have a 125-channel TV tuner, 512 megabytes of memory, an 80-gigabyte hard drive, CD and DVD recorders and a variety of memory card slots, all tucked behind a 46-inch liquid-crystal display screen.
3/29/2005	Brazil: Free Software's Biggest and Best Friend	Since taking office two years ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has turned Brazil into a tropical outpost of the free software movement. Looking to save millions of dollars in royalties and licensing fees, Mr. da Silva has instructed government ministries and state-run companies to gradually switch from costly operating systems made by Microsoft and others to free operating systems, like Linux. On Mr. da Silva's watch, Brazil has also become the first country to require any company or research institute that receives government financing to develop software to license it as open-source, meaning the underlying software code must be free to all.
3/27/2005	TOUGH CROWD	A straw poll of 100 entrepreneurs at Inc. magazine's annual awards ceremony in Tucson found that only 38 said they admired Michael S. Dell, who famously founded the world's leading computer maker while in college. Even fewer -- only 23 -- had something nice to say about Bill Gates, who went from college dropout to world's richest human (and greatest philanthropist) in a little more than two decades.
3/24/2005	Europe Refuses Microsoft's Plan for Trustee	The European Commission said Wednesday that it had rejected a set of restrictions that Microsoft wants to impose on a trustee who will be charged with policing last year's antitrust ruling against the company. ''Microsoft wished to have a veto on what issues the monitoring trustee could examine,'' said Jonathan Todd, a commission spokesman. He added that the request was ''unacceptable'' because it would undermine the role of the trustee, who has yet to be named.
3/23/2005	Rival Calls Microsoft Unready To Carry Out European Order	Microsoft is failing to comply with a European Commission order to sell an unbundled version of its Windows operating system, competitors that were asked to examine the program said on Tuesday. A year ago, Mario Monti, then the European commissioner for competition, ordered Microsoft to sell a second version of Windows in Europe that has its music and video-playing program, Media Player, stripped out.
3/18/2005	Europeans Doubt Microsoft Is Obeying Antitrust Order	The European Commission has ''strong doubts'' that Microsoft is obeying an order issued a year ago in a landmark antitrust ruling against the company, a commission spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said Thursday. It plans to discuss its concerns with Microsoft, and could impose fines up to 5 percent of daily worldwide sales until it decides that the company is complying.
3/17/2005	Security Center Makes Sure You're Alerted	Q. In the last few weeks I have persistently received System Tray balloons with an icon that looks like a shield and a message saying, ''Your computer might be at risk,'' along with other messages about viruses and spyware. What is this? I already use antivirus and antispyware programs. Do I still need to be concerned about these alerts? A. Although it might seem like annoying nagware, that importunate icon shaped like a shield belongs to the Windows Security Center, which is a part of the Windows XP Service Pack 2 system upgrade released by Microsoft last year. Windows Service Pack 2 contains features that are supposed to keep your PC safer from intruders, Internet worms and other online perils; more information for home computer users is at www.microsoft.com/athome/security/default.mspx.
3/16/2005	Microsoft Preparing Challenge To Google and Yahoo for Ads	Microsoft is expected to offer a first look today at some features of a new advertising system on the MSN search engine, part of the company's effort to match the success of Google in the paid Internet search business. The service, called MSN adCenter, is yet to be tested, but executives say it could allow Microsoft to catch up to the top two Web search engines, Google and Yahoo, in search-based advertising by creating a system with broader scope.
3/16/2005	Europe Ends Deal Inquiry	The European Commission ended its inquiry Tuesday into the joint acquisition by Microsoft and Time Warner of ContentGuard, an antipiracy software company, after a third buyer joined the purchasing group. On Monday, the two companies dropped their original deal and informed the commission's competition officials that Thomson, the French technology company, would become a partner in a new three-way deal to buy ContentGuard. As no single shareholder would have control over ContentGuard, the three-way deal would not be subject to European Union merger rules, the commission said in a statement.
3/11/2005	Buyers Waive Hearing on Software Deal	Microsoft and Time Warner have waived their right to a hearing in the continuing European Commission investigation into their plan to take over ContentGuard, which makes software for digital rights management, a person involved in the case said Thursday. The move is seen as a sign of confidence that the regulator will approve the deal, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
3/11/2005	Microsoft Acquires PC Pioneer's Company	Ray Ozzie, whose popular Lotus Notes software helped demonstrate the power of office PC networks in the early 1990's, has gone to work for the PC software king, Bill Gates of Microsoft. Mr. Ozzie's company, Groove Networks, develops software intended to permit simple collaboration by workers using desktop or portable computers, whether they are in the same office or connected via the Internet.
3/10/2005	Technology Briefing | Games: Microsoft To Offer Game Content Online	Microsoft said the next version of its Xbox video game console would allow players to make online purchases of extra content while they are playing a game. JAllard, a Microsoft vice president, said in a speech yesterday at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco that players would be able to buy content using new software and a Web-based marketplace on the Xbox 2.
3/10/2005	System Follows a Paperless Trail To Reduce Outdated Documents	E-mail and word-processing programs have made collaborating on long documents much easier than it used to be, but getting everyone onto the same page -- or even into the right revision of the document -- can feel like herding cats. NextPage 1.5, a document-tracking system for Microsoft Office files, provides a way to lasso multiple copies of a document and make sure no one is working on an outdated version. The NextPage system does not store the files on a central server or database, but works by tagging each desired Word, Excel or PowerPoint document with a hidden tracking number deep inside the file's code. As the document moves from person to person by e-mail, the NextPage software sends a notification message each time the file is edited or renamed, and tells who made the changes. The system can also create a complete history of a single document to show every person who worked on it along the way.
3/10/2005	Search Engines Build a Better Mousetrap	GOOGLE has so firmly staked out its place as the Internet search-engine leader that it has even earned a place as a verb in the English lexicon. Paradoxically, because of its very popularity, there may be no better time to try something different.
3/9/2005	New Microsoft Products Aim To Take Ground From Phones	Microsoft introduced three software products on Tuesday that are intended to blur the lines between traditional phones and computer networks within corporations. The company is searching for ways to bring new life to the increasingly mature market for its Office programs. It has set its sights on what it calls real-time collaboration software as its next big area of growth.
3/3/2005	Computer Tutorials On a Disc	''WHY can't a computer be as simple and reliable as a toaster?'' goes the old plaint. Wouldn't that be great? Put in a couple of blank sheets of paper, push down the lever, adjust the slider to avoid overcooked prose, then wait until the documents pop up, piping hot and ready to consume. But hell shows no signs of freezing over, and computers are only getting more complex. So how is the ordinary person-with-a-life supposed to master these overwhelming beasts?
3/3/2005	Patent Ruling Against Microsoft Is Thrown Out	A federal appeals court threw out a $521 million patent verdict against Microsoft yesterday and ordered a new trial in the case. The Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said a trial judge had erred in failing to let a jury hear some evidence to support Microsoft's claim that the patent it had been accused of infringing on was invalid.
3/3/2005	World Briefing | Europe: Britain: Honorary Knighthood For Bill Gates	Queen Elizabeth II conferred an honorary knighthood on Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, in a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his role in business and philanthropy. The honor will not permit Mr. Gates to use the title sir -- a form of address restricted to British and Commonwealth residents. Mr. Gates said he was ''humbled and delighted.'' Other Americans who have received the honor include former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush; the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan; former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York; the filmmaker Steven Spielberg; and Bob Hope. Alan Cowell (NYT)
3/3/2005	Faster Memory Cards Keep Up With the Action	Q. I recently purchased a four-megapixel digital camera and a regular 256-megabyte memory card. The sales clerk suggested that I buy a more expensive ''high speed'' memory card instead. What advantages, if any, would the more expensive card have given me? A. In addition to the various formats of memory cards available for different cameras, newer versions with the enticing label ''high speed'' are available, which may add to consumer confusion. What it boils down to is that certain digital cameras are designed to work with these high-speed memory cards, and they can snap pictures in quicker succession and then copy them to the card much faster than regular memory cards.
2/27/2005	Microsoft Chairman Challenges Governors to Improve High Schools	Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, delivered a blistering critique of American high schools on Saturday, and his foundation promised $15 million to states to make immediate improvements. Mr. Gates, speaking to the National Governors Association, said that ''America's high schools are obsolete'' and are ''ruining the lives of millions of Americans every year.''
2/26/2005	Europe Reviews Microsoft's Compliance With Antitrust Ruling	The European Commission is consulting with the computer industry over the next week on whether Microsoft is complying with last March's antitrust ruling against the company, a commission spokesman said Friday. In addition to fining the company a record 497 million euros ($656 million), the commission ordered Microsoft to offer a second version of its Windows operating system for the European market that does not have Microsoft's Media Player software program built into it.
2/24/2005	Tools to Add Moving Images To Online Musings	THE Oxford English Dictionary added ''blog'' to its entries in 2003. The editors may soon have to consider ''vlog'' and ''moblog'' as well. Web logs -- the personal online journals better known as blogs -- use text to dissect nearly every conceivable topic, and now video blogs, or vlogs, which incorporate moving images, are on the rise. Mobile blogs, or moblogs, have brought blogging into the cellular age by allowing people to post video and photos taken with camera phones to a blog, or to call in an audio posting.
2/21/2005	A new Claria service creates a partnership with publishers that eliminates those pesky pop-up ads.	THE Claria Corporation, a company that has in recent years collected enemies among Internet users and publishers, is ready to play nice. The company, formerly known as the Gator Corporation, built a business covering consumer desktops and publisher Web sites with pop-up ads. But last week Claria announced a new advertising service that rejects pop-ups and seeks to make business partners of publishers.
2/19/2005	The Boss in the Machine	''THERE are unused icons on your desktop'': this message sometimes appears in a balloon on the lower right-hand corner of my computer screen. I can't imagine why I should be alerted to this fact. The condition of my personal workspace is my own business, as I see it. But no matter what I might be doing at the moment -- writing, reading, coding, thinking or (God forbid) simply letting my thoughts trail off where they may -- the designers of the Windows XP operating system seem to think I should stop right now and clean up my desk. That is why I was surprised to read that Microsoft researchers now feel confident that they can figure out when it's all right to interrupt me. According to the project director for something called the Attentional User Interface, the researchers believe they ''can detect when users are available for communication, or when the user is in a state of flow.''
2/17/2005	Making Pen and Paper As Mighty as a Computer	Compared with tablet computers, paper tablets and sketch pads cost less and are more readily available, but they aren't as useful. Or are they?
2/16/2005	Gates Tells of Microsoft Effort to Fight Viruses	Bill Gates said on Tuesday that Microsoft planned to introduce this summer a new version of its Internet Explorer Web browser with stronger features to protect against viruses and other vexing security flaws that have plagued Windows users. In a speech at the RSA computer security conference, Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said the company was making progress in its fight against spam, adding that ''phishing'' software scams were the fastest-growing security problem the company faced. He said the company was currently spending about $2 billion a year on computer security development and research.
2/15/2005	Nokia Makes Deal to Use Microsoft's Music Formats	Nokia and Microsoft, which have a history as rivals, have decided to work together when it comes to mobile music. Nokia, the leading cellphone manufacturer and a longtime Microsoft competitor in mobile phone software, said Monday that it had agreed to use Microsoft's music formats on its handsets.
2/15/2005	A WPP Executive Joins Worldgroup	For the second time in three months, McCann Worldgroup in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has hired an executive who worked on the I.B.M. account at the New York flagship office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. McCann named Matthew Ross to serve in the new posts of global chief executive for Microsoft brands and president at the McCann San Francisco office. Mr. Ross, 44, had been chief operating officer for global brand services on the I.B.M. account at Ogilvy New York. McCann agencies handle Microsoft assignments in more than 40 countries.
2/10/2005	Saving Energy at PC: It's as Simple as Sleep	AS part of their research into making electronic products more efficient, Bruce Nordman and other energy-use analysts at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., prowl around late at night studying the secret life of office machines. Among the printers and photocopiers, things are not very lively. About three-quarters of these machines automatically slip into power-saving mode after their users leave for the day.
2/10/2005	Recorder Lets You Talk for Hours And Carries Its Own U.S.B. Plug	Most solid-state digital voice recorders export their files to computers through a U.S.B. link for transcription or e-mailing. Most digital music players use U.S.B. to import music files from computers. Either way, the U.S.B. link only works if you have the necessary cable. Sanyo's ICR-S700RM, which doubles as a stereo voice recorder and a player for MP3 and Windows Media music files, won't let you leave that link behind. Its U.S.B. 2.0 plug folds out from the case, no cables required.
2/10/2005	Mac Meets PC And Both Learn to Share	WHEN Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, introduced the $499 Mac Mini in January, he called it a ''bring your own display, keyboard and mouse'' machine. Implicit in that characterization is that the Mini is meant to appeal in part to PC owners who may want to give Apple a try, and who already have those peripherals connected to their Windows machines. The trouble is, if you're going to move your keyboard, mouse and monitor to a Mac, you will no longer be able to use the PC. That may be just fine with Apple, but not for users who don't want to give up their PC. While they may be attracted to the Mac for its easy-to-use software like iPhoto and GarageBand, they may prefer their PC for games or work-related tasks, or they may have one or two PC-only programs that they can't live without.
2/3/2005	How Fine Is This Wine? Virtual Cellar Could Answer That Question With Ease	Some wine lovers lose sleep wondering when they should open the $100 Burgundy they bought five years ago. Now there is online help for them. A new Web site, cellartracker.com, lets wine drinkers keep a virtual wine cellar online, tracking their purchase and consumption records, while also allowing them to share notes about how certain vintages are drinking.
2/1/2005	Rise in Income And Spending For December	Incomes and personal spending rose in December and sales of new homes increased, signs that the economy had momentum entering 2005, according to data released yesterday. Incomes surged a record 3.7 percent after Microsoft's one-time $32.6 billion dividend payout, the Commerce Department reported. Personal spending rose 0.8 percent in December, after a 0.4 percent rise in November, the department also reported, and December home sales rose 0.1 percent.
2/1/2005	Universal's Second Chance to Make Video Pay	The world's biggest music company wants to make sure it doesn't end up playing the blues again because of the music video business. The Universal Music Group of Vivendi Universal says it will no longer provide music videos free, or at a nominal cost, to Internet and cable television services that are building a potentially giant business by playing videos on demand. Universal does not want to repeat what it considers the music industry's ill-fated decision in the 1980's to provide free videos to MTV.
2/1/2005	Microsoft Introduces Its Own Search Service	Two years after saying it planned to enter the battle of Internet search engines, Microsoft is introducing its homegrown search technology to the users of its MSN service and Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft has offered Web search services for years, but until today it used underlying technology provided by Yahoo.
2/1/2005	Law Barring Junk E-Mail Allows a Flood Instead	A year after a sweeping federal antispam law went into effect, there is more junk e-mail on the Internet than ever, and Levon Gillespie, according to Microsoft, is one reason. Lawyers for the company seemed well on the way to shutting down Mr. Gillespie last September after he agreed to meet them at a Starbucks in Los Angeles near the University of Southern California. There they served him a court summons and a lawsuit accusing him, his Web site and 50 unnamed customers of violating state and federal law -- including the year-old federal Can Spam Act -- by flooding Microsoft's internal and customer e-mail networks with illegal spam, among other charges.
1/31/2005	Search Sites Play a Game of Constant Catch-Up	Last Monday, Google representatives called analysts and reporters to trumpet a new service that searches the transcripts of television broadcasts. Yahoo, Google's rival, got wind of the announcement and within hours, its publicity machine had bolted into action to say it had a similar service in the works. Perhaps the fiercest competition on the Internet these days is among sites offering new ways to search through more information. Yahoo and Microsoft each have hundreds of engineers trying to challenge Google's leadership, and dozens of minor players are trying to find ways of getting their services noticed. A9, Amazon.com's search service, recently sent vans with digital cameras onto the streets of some cities to take pictures of businesses. The photos were later displayed alongside telephone numbers in A9's phone directory.
1/29/2005	VERIZON TV SERVICE TO USE MICROSOFT PRODUCT	Verizon Communications, the country's largest telecommunications company, said yesterday that it would use a program guide designed by Microsoft in the television service it expects to introduce in the second half of this year. Microsoft's software will allow viewers to change channels, call up on-demand programs and use a digital video recorder. Verizon has been installing fiber optic cables in nearly a dozen states to carry the television signals to consumers' homes. Other companies, including the cable provider Comcast, also use Microsoft's program guide. Verizon and Microsoft did not announce financial terms of the deal. Ken Belson (NYT)
1/28/2005	Windows, Boxes and a Halo Bolster Microsoft Profit	Microsoft posted solid growth in quarterly sales and profit yesterday, buoyed by strong holiday sales of personal computers and video games. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said sales for the second quarter rose 7 percent, to $10.82 billion, surpassing the $10.55 billion average of Wall Street analysts' estimates.
1/27/2005	PowerPoint Goes to the Fair	STUDENTS in Dan Carroll's honors physics class at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Va., turned in their science projects this week. Some of them prepared their work the way generations of students have done, with labels and charts pasted onto display boards of a prescribed size. But others were able to bypass last-minute trips to the store for cardboard, glue sticks and markers, because Mr. Carroll encourages the use of PowerPoint software.
1/27/2005	Custom Tailor A Web Browser Just for You	IT used to be that Internet Explorer, the one-size-fits-all Web browser bundled with every copy of Microsoft Windows, was enough for most people. It worked well and cost nothing. Who needed anything else? That attitude is fading these days as consumers begin to realize that other browsers offer more features, better security and greater freedom. Bells and whistles, perhaps, but some of them can be surprisingly useful.
1/26/2005	Health Network to Make Use Of Open Standards for Data	Eight of the nation's largest technology companies, including I.B.M., Microsoft and Oracle, have agreed to embrace open, nonproprietary technology standards as the software building blocks for a national health information network. The Bush administration has said that creating such a network should be a national priority over the next several years. The goal is to improve care and reduce costs by abandoning paper and moving to a digital system for handling patient records, clinical research, claims and payments. Such a network, analysts agree, should save both lives and dollars.
1/25/2005	Microsoft Yields In Brussels Case	Microsoft said Monday that it would not appeal a court ruling last month that requires the company to sell in Europe a version of its Windows operating system without its media-playing software. ''Microsoft has decided to forgo its right to appeal,'' the company said in a statement. The new version of Windows is already available to personal computer makers, and retail customers will be able to buy it in coming weeks.
1/20/2005	Organizers Carve Out Turf On a Shared PC	Q. How do you set up a computer to synchronize the address books for two separate Palm organizers? A. As long as each Palm organizer has a different name, all can keep their individual data ducks in a row and happily coexist on a desktop computer. Palm device names are usually assigned during the setup process; most people just use their own full names to label their organizers. Based on the device name, the Palm Desktop software creates a User account for each new Palm that is synchronized to the computer.
1/20/2005	Smithsonian's Song Catalog Is Available for Sale Online	Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie and the barking tree frogs are finally going online. Some 30,000 songs from the legendary Smithsonian Folkways catalog -- field recordings of folk and blues, world and children's music, jazz, nature sounds and poetry -- went on sale yesterday on Microsoft's MSN Music store (music.msn.com) for 99 cents apiece.
1/15/2005	No Limits for Inaugural Fund-Raisers	President Bush's top fund-raisers, who gathered a record sum in a marathon campaign, have shown that they can sprint, as well, collecting up to $40 million in six weeks for the inaugural celebrations. ''We're about finished,'' said Mercer Reynolds, co-chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which has commitments for the money it needs and is now focused on collecting the checks.
1/13/2005	TV Room's PC Wants to Be the Center of All Media	MANY air travelers have slipped DVD's into their laptops as an alternative to the in-flight movie. And for years, enthusiasts have installed tuners and software in their PC's to watch and record TV programs. In 2002, Microsoft sought to take these activities into the mainstream with a new version of its Windows XP operating system, the Media Center Edition. Designed to turn a PC into an entertainment hub, it provided a single interface for watching TV, showing DVD's, displaying digital photos and playing music.
1/13/2005	Apple Tries to Break Out	Apple Computer's classic advertisements urge buyers to ''think different,'' and this week the company took its own advice. It broke with its longstanding policy of catering to the connoisseurs of high-end cool and unveiled both a $499 desktop computer, called the Mac Mini, and a $99 stripped-down version of the iPod digital music player. We'll see whether the strategy works, but it's interesting to see a company whose customers have always regarded themselves as a lonely elite deciding to try a new direction. Despite Apple's complaints about Microsoft's dominance, one of the biggest drags on Apple's growth has been that its computers generally cost more than similar Windows PC's. But the Mac Mini has a base price hundreds of dollars below what had been Apple's lowest-priced computer. The $499 is misleading because it does not include a monitor, keyboard, mouse and other needed items, but the sticker price may get the attention of some Microsoft users, particularly the millions of people who have been introduced to Apple through iPods.
1/12/2005	Changing Course, Apple Offers Low-Priced Mac for the Home	Apple Computer introduced its first low-priced Macintosh on Tuesday, signaling its bet that most consumers now see computers as simply another appliance in the modern house. While computers have long been sold as machines that can turn a home into an office, most Americans now use them in their bedrooms and kitchens as e-mail terminals; as hubs for playing music, storing and editing photos; and as stations for navigating the Web.
1/11/2005	Technology Briefing | Biotechnology: Microsoft Offers Discount To Peoplesoft Clients	Microsoft is offering a 25 percent discount to customers of PeopleSoft, which was acquired last month by the Oracle Corporation. The offer covers licensing of business applications such as accounting and payroll, and the first year of support programs, Microsoft said yesterday. Microsoft is courting PeopleSoft customers worried that Oracle will not continue to provide upgrades and other support. Oracle shares fell 14 cents, to $13.19. Microsoft shares rose 13 cents to $26.80. An Oracle spokeswoman, Deborah Lilienthal, declined to comment.
1/7/2005	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Offers Free Antivirus Tools	Microsoft, responding to escalating complaints about viruses and unwanted programs entering its Windows operating system, has released a free tool to erase spyware and will offer a virus-removal program. The virus-cleaning product will be available on Tuesday, the company said yesterday. The product scans computers for viruses and removes them. A survey last year showed that 80 percent of PC's were infected with spyware, which monitors a user's activity and slows performance. Shares of the antivirus market leader, Symantec, and its planned merger partner, Veritas Software, tumbled after the announcement. Shares of Microsoft fell 3 cents, to $26.75. Symantec fell $1.86, to $23.18. Veritas declined $1.90, to $25.56.
1/6/2005	From Soup Cans to Still Lifes, Turn the Den Into an Art Gallery	Not all art must hang in a frame. GalleryPlayer, an image-downloading service, can transform a big blank TV screen into a dynamic digital canvas. For $5 to $7 a month, the service provides 20 to 25 images in any of several categories, allowing you to create a high-resolution slide show on televisions connected to a Microsoft Media Center PC. Requirements include high-speed Internet access for downloading and a Media Center PC running GalleryPlayer software, to convert the downloaded files into images. Media Center PC's offer multiple ports for transferring the images to the television, including Digital Visual Interface, S-video and VGA. Viewing is optimal on a liquid-crystal display or plasma television.
1/6/2005	Sirius Radio Will Offer Satellite Television Service for Cars	Sirius Satellite Radio Inc., No. 2 in the pay-radio business, said yesterday that it planned to offer a satellite TV service for cars, in partnership with the Microsoft Corporation. The service, which would offer several channels of children's programming, is scheduled to start in the second half of next year, Sirius said, adding that it would use Microsoft's Windows Media software to deliver the programs. No agreement has been reached with carmakers, Sirius said.
1/6/2005	Not a Palmtop, Not a Laptop, Tiny PC Wields a Lot of Power	A few lightweight notebook computers are already smaller than their spiral-bound namesakes, but Sony Electronics has introduced a full-fledged Windows XP machine even tinier than most other portable PC's. Just over an inch thick, the Sony Vaio VGN-U750P weighs just 1.2 pounds and is 6.6 inches wide by 4.3 inches high.
1/5/2005	Money From Microsoft	Under the terms of Microsoft's antitrust settlement, businesses and individual consumers in California who bought Windows, Word, Excel, Office or certain other Microsoft products from 1995 to 2001 are eligible for rebates on technology purchases. Claim forms are at www.microsoftcalsettlement.com.
1/5/2005	Few Takers for Payments From Microsoft Settlement	With only a few days remaining before a Saturday deadline, about 80 of California's largest 100 companies have filed to receive part of a $1.1 billion antitrust settlement with Microsoft, a lawyer involved in the settlement said yesterday. But it appears that only a small percentage of customers eligible to receive part of the settlement have filed to claim their share, said the lawyer, Richard L. Grossman of Townsend, Townsend & Crew, the lead lawyer representing California consumers in the settlement fight.
1/2/2005	SUNDAY INTERVIEW: WITH SCOTT McNEALY; New Year, New Scraps For Sun's Feisty Chief	SCOTT McNEALY, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, has always been impassioned. He has, for example, accused Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior. So it was surprising when he agreed in April to settle an antitrust suit against Microsoft for $1.6 billion and the promise that Microsoft would work with Sun on certain projects.
12/30/2004	A High-Speed Connection Makes Friends With TV	In the late 1990's, when only 4 out of 10 American households had computers, Microsoft snatched up a start-up company that made Internet-enabled set-top boxes for television sets, which were present in almost every household at the time. Web TV, as it was called, never really caught on, at least partly because computers rapidly became cheaper and more powerful. But now Microsoft is making another run at set-top technology aimed at making television much more interactive.
12/30/2004	Safe Mode in Windows Helps Fix What Ails It	Q. What is a Safe Mode boot? A. Windows can sometimes be a fussy operating system to start when you turn on the computer and the program senses that something is not quite right. A software installation gone bad, an incompatible device driver or a dynamic library link (D.L.L.) file can interfere with the ability of Windows to boot up properly. When this happens, the computer comes up in Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a diagnostic tool that lets you troubleshoot whatever is ailing Windows. It is a function of just about every version of the operating system Microsoft has released. When the PC starts in Safe Mode, it loads only the components the operating system needs to run. When Windows has opted for Safe Mode, the desktop will not have its usual pattern, the screen will display only 16 colors, and Safe Mode will appear in the corners of the screen.
12/26/2004	DON'T BE EVIL	After the dreary litany of corporate scandal in recent years, it seems refreshing to have a company declare that its guiding principle is ''Don't be evil.'' Google repeated this paean to good corporate citizenship endlessly in days leading up to its successful stock sale to the public in August.
12/23/2004	Europe Rejects Microsoft's Bid To Preserve Bundling Plan	A European court swept aside Microsoft's objections yesterday and ordered it to offer a version of its Windows operating system without its software for playing digital music and movies on personal computers. The ruling applies only to Europe, but it represents the first time since antitrust challenges to Microsoft began in the 1990's that the company will be forced to alter its bedrock business strategy of bundling its software products and features with Windows. The basic operations of more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers are controlled by Microsoft's Windows program.
12/23/2004	Return Policies Vary For Opened Software	Q. How do retail stores or manufacturers handle refunds on software? If I'm not happy with the software, can I get a full refund? The information provided on the box and in the online description is limited. A. In many cases, returning software to the store or manufacturer that you bought it from can be a little tricky if you've already ripped the shrink-wrap or torn open the box.
12/22/2004	Washington Post Company Buys Slate Magazine	The Washington Post Company said yesterday that it had purchased Slate, an online magazine owned by Microsoft. The sale completes Slate's transformation from an experiment in the new media in 1996 to a respected brand name in journalism. Terms of the sale were not announced, but industry specialists estimated that the deal was worth between $15 million and $20 million.
12/19/2004	The Fox Is in Microsoft's Henhouse (and Salivating)	FIREFOX is a classic overnight success, many years in the making. Published by the Mozilla Foundation, a nonprofit group supporting open-source software that draws upon the skills of hundreds of volunteer programmers, Firefox is a Web browser that is fast and filled with features that Microsoft's stodgy Internet Explorer lacks. Firefox installs in a snap, and it's free.
12/17/2004	Symantec to Buy Veritas Software In Deal Worth $13.5 Billion	The Symantec Corporation, a leader in security software and one of Silicon Valley's oldest companies, announced early Thursday that it would acquire Veritas Software, a maker of data storage programs, to create the world's fourth-largest software company. The all-stock transaction was valued at $13.5 billion. The deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of next year, will give the combined company revenue of $5 billion next year. Only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, a German-based competitor, would have greater software sales.
12/13/2004	PlayStation 2 Shortage Frustrates More Than Buyers	If you are having trouble crossing the Sony PlayStation 2 off your holiday shopping list this year, you are not alone. A shortage of PlayStation 2 consoles has left retailers scrambling to meet demand. Sony's official explanation for the shortfall is tied to the popularity of a new, slimmer version of the original PlayStation 2 that became available Nov. 1.
12/10/2004	I.B.M. Bids the PC Adieu	The news that I.B.M. is selling its personal computer division is not very surprising. The bloom is long gone off the PC market, profits have plummeted, and the machine has become utterly generic. The brand on the box matters less than it ever has. And that is the direct result of decisions made by I.B.M. before it introduced its first PC in 1981. In those days, the personal computer was synonymous with Apple, which kept a close hold on its machines. I.B.M. chose to create a PC with parts developed by other manufacturers. It was a great way to get computers into the hands of consumers and to guarantee plenty of competition. But it also meant that the only powerful proprietary grasp to arise from the PC belonged to Intel, which made the processor chips, and to Microsoft, which licensed the operating system called MS-DOS.
12/8/2004	Sale of I.B.M. PC Unit Is a Bridge Between Companies and Cultures	I.B.M. announced late yesterday the sale of its personal computer business to Lenovo, China's largest personal computer maker, a deal that reflects the industrial and economic ambitions of not only the two companies but also their two nations. Under Lenovo's ownership, the I.B.M. personal computer business will continue to be based in the United States and run by its current management team. I.B.M. will take a stake of 18.9 percent in Lenovo, which is based in Beijing but plans to have headquarters in New York.
12/5/2004	A Long March From Maoism to Microsoft	IN one sense, Sidney Rittenberg can be viewed as just another international business consultant scrambling to cash in on the China boom. He certainly appears to fit the mold, driving an expensive late-model BMW and serving as an adviser to a long list of companies that have included Microsoft, Intel, Prudential Insurance and Polaroid. But at 83, Mr. Rittenberg is a striking contrast with the new breed of self-proclaimed China experts setting up shop on either side of the Pacific, promoting themselves as corporate matchmakers. It's a safe bet, after all, that he is the only American business consultant who can claim to have been airbrushed out of a photograph appearing in the official Beijing Review. And certainly none of his competitors can say, as he did in his autobiography, ''Mao didn't really like me.''
12/3/2004	I.B.M. SAID TO PUT ITS PC BUSINESS ON THE MARKET	International Business Machines, whose first I.B.M. PC in 1981 moved personal computing out of the hobby shop and into the corporate and consumer mainstream, has put the business up for sale, people close to the negotiations said yesterday. While I.B.M. long ago ceded the lead in the personal computer market to Dell and Hewlett-Packard so it could focus instead on the more lucrative corporate server and computer services business, a sale would nonetheless bring the end of an era in an industry that it helped invent. The sale, likely to be in the $1 billion to $2 billion range, is expected to include the entire range of desktop, laptop and notebook computers made by I.B.M.
12/2/2004	2 Giants to Introduce Enhanced Data Sharing Services on Net	Google and Microsoft separately plan to introduce on Thursday enhanced information sharing services for Internet users. Microsoft plans for the first time to offer a service called MSN Spaces, which will allow users to create personal Web logs, or blogs. It will also offer an updated version of the company's instant messaging program, MSN Messenger.
12/2/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Releases Fix For Net Explorer	Microsoft published a patch for Internet Explorer yesterday, aiming to close a month-old hole called the Internet Explorer Elements flaw. The issue -- which does not affect Microsoft's major Windows XP security update, Service Pack 2 -- could allow an attacker to take control of a victim's PC, if the user is logged on as an administrator.
12/2/2004	Security Suite Sorts Out the Junk In the Flurry of Holiday E-Mail	The holiday season typically brings a flood of extra e-mail: not only electronic greetings and links to online family newsletters, but also junk mail, which seems to increase exponentially. Those wanting to clear some of the clutter may want to take a look at Symantec's Norton Internet Security 2005 suite, which includes Norton AntiSpam 2005. The spam-filtering program weeds out the junk that streams into most POP3 e-mail accounts and works with Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express, Qualcomm's Eudora program, and Yahoo Web mail. AntiSpam 2005 can spot some identity-theft scams with fraudulent sender addresses. The Internet Security suite helps protect the computer further with Norton AntiVirus and Norton Personal Firewall, in addition to Norton's programs for privacy and parental control.
12/1/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Beijing Cancels Microsoft Order	Microsoft lost an order from the city of Beijing after a science ministry official complained that local governments were not buying enough Chinese-developed software. Beijing's government procurement office changed its mind about buying 29.25 million yuan ($3.5 million) worth of Microsoft Windows and Office software on Nov. 27, 10 days after awarding the contract, according to a statement yesterday on its Web site. The decision underscores the challenge Microsoft, whose Windows software runs almost 95 percent of the world's personal computers, faces in building a profitable business in China. Besides competition from the local industry, which the government wants to promote, Microsoft must also cope with widespread piracy of its products. Microsoft officials in Beijing were not immediately available to comment.
12/1/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Panel Suspends Review Of ContentGuard Buyout	The European Union's antitrust regulator, the European Commission, suspended a review of a plan by Microsoft and Time Warner to buy ContentGuard, a maker of antipiracy software, a commission spokesman said yesterday. Microsoft and Time Warner have not answered all of the commission's questions on the deal, said a commission spokesman, Jonathan Todd. The European Commission, which is based in Brussels, requested information from both companies on Nov. 5, he said. Thomson, the world's largest maker of set-top boxes, said last week that it would join Microsoft and Time Warner in the deal, buying 33 percent for an undisclosed price. Mr. Todd declined to say whether the agreement with Thomson would affect the commission's review. In August the commission opened a four-month inquiry of the purchase, citing concerns that the combination would dominate the market for software to prevent illegal copying of music and movies over the Internet. It was due to rule Jan. 6.
11/30/2004	Technology Briefing | Deals: Sun Microsystems To Acquire SevenSpace	Sun Microsystems, whose servers run corporate networks and Web sites, has agreed to acquire SevenSpace to increase computer-services sales. SevenSpace products feature remote system monitoring of applications and databases from SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. The company has more than 100 customers in financial services, government, manufacturing and retailing, Sun Microsystems said in a statement. Sun did not disclose the price of the cash purchase. SevenSpace, a closely held company based in Ashburn, Va., has more than 100 employees, a Sun spokeswoman, May G. Petry, said.
11/29/2004	The world is watching as Europe decides whether Microsoft and partners can buy a company that protects digital content.	A decade ago, the expression ''content is king'' was seized upon by the new-media world while it was struggling to come up with a business model. The slogan embodied the idea that drove Internet companies like America Online to team up with content companies like Time Warner to capitalize on the transition to digital communications. Mostly, it hasn't worked out that way. Today, ''content is king'' is still operative, but it is playing out more quietly. It is no longer the content itself that is getting attention but the control of the content.
11/25/2004	'Send To' Shortcuts Will Speed Files Along	Q. It is often convenient in Microsoft Word to right-click on a file name and then use the Send To feature to copy it to another folder or onto a CD or a memory stick. But the target folder on the hard drive is limited to My Documents. Is there a way to send files to specific folders or devices? A. The Send To feature in Windows does save quite a bit of time, especially if you regularly copy files to certain places or send them as e-mail attachments.
11/25/2004	Oracle Nominates 4	The Oracle Corporation nominated directors yesterday to the board of PeopleSoft Inc. Four of seven PeopleSoft directors are up for election at next year's meeting, which has not yet been scheduled. If Oracle's slate of candidates wins, the board is likely to drop the defenses it put into place to fight Oracle's takeover bid.
11/24/2004	Judge Calls Conference On Microsoft	After the withdrawal of two critical witnesses, the European Court of First Instance summoned all parties involved in the Microsoft antitrust case to a meeting Thursday in Luxembourg, Christopher Fretwell, a court spokesman, said Tuesday. People close to the case said that Judge Bo Vesterdorf wants to discuss the situation in light of the withdrawal of two prominent Microsoft foes, Novell and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, from the trial earlier this month.
11/23/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Belgium: Thomson Enters ContentGuard Deal	The European Commission is not automatically halting its investigation into a plan by Microsoft and Time Warner to take over the antipiracy specialist ContentGuard, a spokesman said, despite the arrival of a third merger partner, Thomson of France. Thomson announced plans to take a one-third stake in ContentGuard. The move would dilute the influence of Microsoft and Time Warner over ContentGuard. The European Commission said one of its main concerns about the deal was that it could allow Microsoft to take effective control of the merged entity. With a third equal partner this becomes impossible. However, the commission will continue with its investigation of the deal until it is officially notified about Thomson's inclusion, said Jonathan Todd, the commission's competition spokesman. Thomson's investment adds a ''European-headquartered partner that will make this important technology more accessible,'' Bill Gates, above, Microsoft's chairman, said in a statement.

11/22/2004	Playing Games in Your 20's? Nintendo Is Onto You	For the last several years, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have fought over an audience for console video games that is growing older and more mainstream. But Nintendo has largely had the market for hand-held games -- which appeal mostly to children and teenagers -- to itself. Now Nintendo -- and Sony -- are also looking at an older audience. Yesterday, the $149 Nintendo DS went on sale, a portable device that is initially being marketed to older game players, those in their late teens and early 20's. With two monitors, touchscreen control, a Palm-style stylus and wireless connectivity that allows for head-to-head game play, the DS is trying to capture more sophisticated game players who otherwise would be playing consoles like the Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2. Nintendo even plays off the new features with advertisements in magazines like Maxim featuring the tagline ''Touching is Good.''
11/22/2004	Does Bigger Mean Better?	Last week, Google announced that it had doubled, to more than eight billion, the number of Web pages its search engine can find. The announcement -- a search engine version of trash-talking -- came one day before Microsoft introduced its search engine, which has indexed about five billion pages. That makes Microsoft a distant second -- for now --in the race to cover the largest swath of the Internet. Yahoo does not make the number of pages in its index available to the public. SearchEngineWatch, a Web site that covers the industry, estimates, however, that Yahoo ranks third with about four billion pages.
11/18/2004	Systems Sharpen Their Game	SHOPPING for video game systems tends to be one of the less confusing tasks for consumers. There are few machines to choose from, which means less jargon to untangle, fewer models to differentiate and fewer prices to compare. This year, the main choices for home and hand-held gaming hardware are the same as they have been for years, with the notable exception of the Nintendo DS, a successor of sorts to the Game Boy.
11/17/2004	SBC to Start Project to Send TV Over Lines	SBC Communications, as part of its effort to compete head-on with the cable industry for television subscribers, plans to announce today that it will pay $400 million to Microsoft for software used to deliver TV programming over high-speed data lines. It would be a crucial move into unproven territory for SBC, which like the other regional telephone giants wants to grow by expanding beyond phone and Internet services and into entertainment. To do that, SBC expects to spend more than $4 billion over the next three years on its fiber optic network to offer faster Internet connections able to carry digital video programming.
11/16/2004	Auction of Internet Commerce Patents Draws Concern	More than three dozen patents said to cover key facets of Internet transactions will soon be auctioned off by Commerce One, a bankrupt software company. But even before the sale, some technology executives and lawyers are worried that potential buyers might wield the patents in infringement lawsuits against companies that are engaged in online commerce, like I.B.M. and Microsoft. The 39 patents cover basic activities like using standardized electronic documents to automate the sale of goods and services over the Internet. Some intellectual property experts said that these patents, which have broad reach, could be used to challenge Web services like the .Net electronic business system from Microsoft or Websphere software from I.B.M. Those companies declined to comment, saying any discussion would be speculative at this point.
11/16/2004	Microsoft Expands Operations in India	The Microsoft Corporation announced on Monday that it was significantly expanding its software development operations in India as it opened a new campus near Hyderabad, its second-largest campus after its headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, formally opened the 28-acre campus in the suburbs of Hyderabad, which is 250 miles north of Bangalore, a rival technology center. The campus thus far has only one building, with capacity for 1,600 workers.
11/15/2004	Sun to Introduce Newest Version Of Solaris Today	Sun Microsystems plans to unveil on Monday the latest version of its flagship Solaris operating system. It also intends to offer a free version of the program to make it more attractive to corporate and academic computer users. The program will not be commercially available until the end of January, Sun executives said on Friday, but versions of Solaris 10 have been available for trial use for almost a year.
11/15/2004	In the Battle of the Browsers '04, Firefox Aims at Microsoft	Does anyone remember the browser wars? In the rapid-fire pace of the technology business, Microsoft's successful, though illegal, campaign to thwart competition in the market for Web browsing software during the 1990's seems to be ancient history.
11/14/2004	Page Two: Nov. 7-13; Hollywood Would Kill for Those Numbers	THERE they were: Young adults and teenagers, some dressed in space-commando armor, camping out last Monday in Times Square, waiting for more than 15 hours just to be the first to latch onto this latest entertainment. Did they want to see the umpteenth ''Star Wars'' movie?
11/14/2004	Gates vs. Jobs: The Rematch	THE history of Apple Computer can be told through its advertisements as well as its products. There was, of course, the commercial that introduced the Macintosh. It was broadcast exactly once, during the 1984 Super Bowl, and signaled the company's bid to reclaim leadership in personal computers from I.B.M. and its tiny, little-known software partner, Microsoft. Late last month, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chairman, rented an ornate theater here to promote Apple's latest advertisement for its iPod music player -- a crisp psychedelic montage of the Irish pop band U2 playing ''Vertigo,'' a song from its next album. Unlike the 1984 commercial, this one is intended to help Apple preserve a big, and growing, lead in the marketplace.
11/14/2004	Virtual Warriors Have Feelings, Too	ON Nov. 9, after three years of development, months of frenzied fan speculation and $75 million in pre-orders, Microsoft launched Halo 2, the sequel to the top-selling title for the Xbox video game console. And from the moment Halo 2 finally went on sale, gamers have burned countless hours mastering Halo 2's fancy new weapons and exploring its expanded humans-repel-alien-invaders narrative. But for filmmakers like Burnie Burns, who work in the emerging medium of machinima, these features are a mere starting point. Instead of playing Halo as intended, Mr. Burns and a crew of machinima peers exploit the game's software quirks to create their online comedy series, Red vs. Blue, within Halo's virtual world. Since its debut in the spring of 2003, Red vs. Blue has rivaled Halo itself in popularity; fans download new episodes (www.redvsblue.com) at a rate of over 900,000 a week. GREG ALLEN GREG ALLEN -- How did you start making short films inside a video game? BURNIE BURNS -- I made a 16-millimeter, then the guys I made it with left for L.A. I stayed [in Austin, Tex.] working for a technology company, and basically, I needed a way to write and produce stuff myself. That's when I had the idea. Q -- How do you pronounce machinima? It's one of those words that nobody ever says out loud. A -- I've heard it pronounced both mah-SHIH-ni-ma and mah-SHEE-ni-ma. Q -- What's the basic machinima process? A -- One player in a game is literally a cameraman; you're recording through that character's eyes. It looks like animation, but it's really a lot like live action. You block out a scene and do takes. Then you edit it and dub your own dialogue. Machinima kind of starts when you stop playing. Halo is a virtual world; a character's programmed to talk or shoot when a player enters the room, but what happens right after the player leaves? He's still in there. Q -- So you're exploring the inner lives of these faceless, armor-clad warriors? A -- Exactly. We imagined our own characters and storyline. Sometimes it intersects with the Halo story, like the episode when Sarge calls [their vehicle] the Warthog, and the others think it looks like a puma. But mostly we just tell our own stories. Q -- One of the trademarks of Red vs. Blue is Halo's spare, almost Beckettian landscape. How does Halo 2, which is more elaborate, change things for you? Is it like when they try to revitalize a sitcom by redecorating? A -- Yeah, or relocating, like when Laverne & Shirley moved to California. [The Halo 2 developers at Bungie] have their own storyline, but we'll still do the absurdist existential comedy. They've upgraded the world; the lighting's different, the rocks are different. They've rendered the characters in much higher detail. But the main thing for us is the new models; now you can control the aliens like you control the marines. So we can do real-world parallels of wars or cultural differences. Q -- It's surprising that Microsoft let Red vs. Blue stay alive. They could've choked it in its crib. A -- [Laughs] They still could. But the guys from Bungie contacted us right away -- they saw it starting at Episode 1 or 2 -- and said they liked it a lot and wanted to make sure we were protected. Everyone's got this need to tell a story, and I think more of these big companies recognize that.
11/12/2004	Using a New Language in Africa to Save Dying Ones	Swahili speakers wishing to use a ''kompyuta'' as computer is rendered in Swahili -- have been out of luck when it comes to communicating in their tongue. Computers, no matter how bulky their hard drives or sophisticated their software packages, have not yet mastered Swahili or hundreds of other indigenous African languages. But that may soon change. Across the continent, linguists are working with experts in information technology to make computers more accessible to Africans who happen not to know English, French or the other major languages that have been programmed into the world's desktops.
11/11/2004	Microsoft Unveils Its Internet Search Engine, Quietly	Microsoft rolled out its long-planned response to Google and Yahoo in the Internet search industry on Wednesday, but with an uncharacteristically soft-sell approach. The debut, taking the form of a test site, was a stark contrast to another high-profile introduction the company made nine years ago. That was when Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, all but declared war on Netscape Communications and its Web browser by announcing his company's own browser, Internet Explorer, and proclaiming, ''We are hard core about the Internet.''
11/11/2004	Trying to Make the Pen as Mighty as the Keyboard	PORTABLE computers that let you give commands or enter text using an electronic pen on the screen could usher in a new era of information sharing. But pen computers like Microsoft's Tablet PC have had only lukewarm success, and writing notes on a palmtop requires learning a kind of shorthand. Pointing at and clicking on on-screen icons using a digital pen can be cumbersome and counterintuitive, and writing on a screen in longhand is much slower than typing. Factor in the huge amount of variation in handwriting and shorthand and it's little wonder computers have had a hard time recognizing them. ''Lots of people have trouble recognizing their own handwriting, so it's not surprising a computer can't do it,'' said Brad Myers, a professor in the human-computer interaction institute at Carnegie Mellon's school of computer science.
11/11/2004	Pick a Number, It's Sequel Season	THE sequel is king, and games with titles like The Sims 2, Burnout 3 and Myst IV receive far more attention than those increasingly rare games with no pedigree. Nothing seems to work gamers into a frenzy of anticipation quite as effectively as the promise of a game that will give them the same thrilling experience they remember from a game they were obsessed with a year or two ago. The secret to a successful sequel is to have a hugely popular game to follow. Based on their illustrious forebears, Halo 2 and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas had tremendous advance sales before anyone knew whether they would be worth playing. How could they not be?
11/10/2004	Connecticut Man Accused Of Selling Microsoft Code	A Connecticut computer hacker was arrested yesterday and charged with selling copies of Microsoft Windows proprietary source code. The United States attorney's office said the hacker, William O. Genovese Jr., 27, of Meriden, Conn., used a Web site to unlawfully distribute the programming blueprints behind the Microsoft NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 operating systems.
11/9/2004	Microsoft Settles With Novell And Joins An Opponent	Microsoft announced yesterday that it had reached a $536 million antitrust settlement with Novell and an agreement with a computer industry trade association that has long fought Microsoft on antitrust issues in the United States and Europe. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, hailed the agreements as the culmination of its 18-month, multibillion-dollar campaign to settle antitrust conflicts with its major antagonists in the industry, including Time Warner and Sun Microsystems.
11/8/2004	Microsoft Seeks Video Game Winner With Halo 2	By midnight tonight, as many as a hundred fans -- mostly men in their late teens and 20's -- will line up near Union Square in New York, eagerly awaiting their first glimpse of the sequel to a science-fiction blockbuster. The line won't be in front of a movie theater but rather at the EB Games outlet on East 14th Street. Those who show up there -- and at more than 6,500 other stores playing host to midnight events across the country -- will be able to buy copies of Halo 2, a video game for the Xbox system published by Microsoft Game Studios.
11/4/2004	Sci-Fi Fans Are Called Into an Alternate Reality	NOTHING, not even Hurricane Frances, was going to keep Zach Dill from answering that phone. Everyone else had fled indoors. But with the storm just minutes away, the 24-year-old technical-support specialist stood in a Burger King parking lot in Tampa, Fla., waiting for a pay phone to ring. The skies turned black. Swirling winds began to lift sand and debris off the parking lot and hurl it in a hundred directions. Then came the rain -- wave after unrelenting wave of ''stinging, cold needles,'' as Mr. Dill later described it. It fell so hard, he had to put his head next to the receiver to hear the phone ring. When he did finally answer, he gave a series of answers to a series of prerecorded riddles. Then he hung up and headed for his car, soaked and triumphant.
11/4/2004	Coming Soon; Cue Klieg Lights, Crowds and Red Carpet: Games Are Landing in Stores With a Splash	A TIMES SQUARE countdown of a different sort is planned for next week. It will not involve a sparkling ball descending a pole, or herald a new year. But this countdown, expected to draw thousands into the streets surrounding the Toys ''R'' Us flagship store, may mark a new height in video game promotion.
11/3/2004	AOL Is Said to Plan 700 Layoffs	America Online, the country's leading Internet service, is preparing to lay off as many as 700 of its 13,000 employees in the United States, according to an executive knowledgeable about its plans. AOL, a unit of Time Warner, is continuing to cope with a declining subscriber base and an advertising business that, while rebounding, trails industry leaders like Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN. The layoffs will not be concentrated among any particular department, the executive said, and the exact jobs to be eliminated have not yet been determined. Time Warner is scheduled to report its earnings for the third quarter today and is expected to identify a reorganization charge related to severance and other costs from the planned layoffs, which were first reported by The Washington Post.
10/29/2004	Internet Giants File 7 Suits Aimed at Stopping Spam	Four leading Internet service providers announced yesterday that they had filed a new round of lawsuits against senders of junk e-mail, or spam. The suits include the first filed by America Online against spammers who use instant messaging, a practice the online industry calls spimming. AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo and EarthLink filed seven lawsuits in four states under the federal antispam law, which aims at stopping billions of unsolicited electronic messages, many with false headings that mislead consumers or seek to sell products that do not exist.
10/28/2004	PC's Can Speak Up For the Vision Impaired	Q. My 82-year-old aunt is slowly losing her sight, but she loves her computer and uses it every day. Are there software programs that will convert text to speech to help her keep up with e-mail and Web pages? A. Both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems offer some built-in functions to help people with visual impairments use the computer. There are also commercial programs that can read aloud text on the screen.
10/26/2004	European Trade Chief Says Sanctions on U.S. Will End	The European trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, announced an end to a five-year dispute with the United States on Monday, saying he was lifting $4 billion in sanctions on American products, after President Bush signed a law repealing tax breaks for large American exporters. But Mr. Lamy, despite his eagerness to sign off on the dispute that has shadowed a term in office soon to end, said he suspected that Washington had left some of the tax breaks in place.
10/22/2004	Sales of PC's Buoy Results At Microsoft	Buoyed by continued strong worldwide sales of personal computers, the Microsoft Corporation yesterday reported strong growth in profits and sales even as it faces the challenges of being a mature technology company. Microsoft, the world's largest maker of software, reported first-quarter sales of $9.19 billion, an increase of 12 percent over the period a year ago. Wall Street analysts had projected that sales would be $8.9 billion.
10/21/2004	Speak Clearly and Carry a Manual	PAM HEATH had led the way through the Microsoft Home, showing off ''smart'' kitchen appliances and mirrors that display computer-generated messages, before she said the words ''Bill G.'s house.'' Bill G.'s house? ''Bill G.,'' it turns out, is how Microsoft employees refer to the company's co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates. Ms. Heath is the lead program manager on the team responsible for the Microsoft Home, a technology-laden demonstration project. And as her 90-minute tour of the Microsoft Home made clear, there are differences between it and Mr. Gates's own much-talked-about house a few miles away.
10/21/2004	Google Takes On Your Desktop	THE modern PC is a marvel, isn't it? Here's a machine that lets an ordinary person with very little training create a new document, check its spelling, dress it up with graphics, send it electronically to someone across the globe -- and then save it accidentally into some dark corner of the hard drive, where it will never be seen again. Of course, every operating system offers a Find command. But the one in Windows is not, ahem, Microsoft's finest work. It requires too many clicks, it asks too many questions, it takes forever, it can't search your e-mail and its results are difficult to interpret. As a final insult, Microsoft endowed the supposedly ultramodern Windows XP with a cartoon dog that appears during the searching, as though to say, ''We know this is taking a long time, but hey, watch the puppy!''
10/21/2004	More Style, Less Skipping When Listening to Hits on the Run	Rocking and rolling, which many people find desirable when it comes to music, are not so good for hard-drive-based digital audio players with moving parts prone to skipping when jostled. Small flash-memory music players, with their solid-state construction, are an obvious alternative for those who want music when they run or work out, and GoVideo's bright red Rave-MP AMP players offer a colorful choice. The Rave-MP AMP line includes a player with 128 megabytes of memory and another that doubles the storage space to 256 megabytes. The AMP 128 and AMP 256 each have slots for Secure Digital or MultiMedia cards, allowing up to a gigabyte of room for music, and both can play song files in the MP3 and Windows Media Audio formats.
10/20/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Announces Windows Licensing Plan	Microsoft has announced a licensing plan for Windows that could mean cost savings for corporate customers that upgrade to multicore computers when they become available starting next year. The move resolves a looming licensing issue for customers as the chip makers Intel and Advanced Micro Devices move closer to converting their microprocessors to multicore technology, which places multiple cores on a single processor in order to increase performance. Today, multicore processors exist only in high-end Unix and mainframe computers, for which Windows is priced according to the number of cores. Both Advanced Micro and Intel have said they planned to ship multicore processors for server computers sometime next year, followed by multicore personal computer chips. The use of multicore chips is expected to overtake that of single-core chips within a few years, according to both chip companies. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
10/19/2004	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Cisco And Microsoft To Fight Virus Problems	Cisco Systems, the largest maker of computer-networking equipment, and Microsoft, the largest software maker, will combine efforts to screen computers for viruses before allowing them to connect to company networks. Microsoft's Windows operating system will work with Cisco's routers, the computers that connect networks, to quarantine and inspect laptops electronically as they enter a network, a Cisco vice president, Richard Palmer, said yesterday. The feature will be incorporated into the next version of Windows, due in 2006. The agreement comes as the number of computer viruses and worms taking aim at the Windows system has surpassed 10,000, according to Symantec, the maker of antivirus software.
10/18/2004	Google Envy Is Fomenting Search Wars	Propelled by Google envy, new players and Internet industry giants are rushing into the online search market, setting off a burst of activity that contrasts sharply with the lull after the dot-com collapse. To fend off its challengers, Google has furiously intensified efforts to add new services to its brand.
10/15/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Google Introduces Desktop Search Program	Google introduced software yesterday that lets users search for files from their own computers, as well as the Web, entering a new area of competition with Microsoft. The test version of the Google Desktop Search feature is free and can be downloaded from desktop.google.com. It can be used to search computer files, e-mail, Web pages that users have visited and online chats, Google said. The MSN Internet unit of Microsoft is developing its own Web search engine. Shares of Google rose $1.10, to $142.
10/14/2004	Cutting the (Headset) Cord On the Xbox Controller	Communication in video games once involved quick text messages expressing sentiments like ''In your face,'' but now games like Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow allow players to chat live by voice, devising strategy, comparing notes -- or shouting ''In your face!'' Xbox owners have had to use headsets for communication, but those who dislike wearing headsets or shoving the headset's cord out of the way may prefer Nyko's SpeakerCom, which uses a speakerphone style of communication.
10/14/2004	Fitting Your PC In a Pocket	IN the last few years, the biggest breakthroughs in personal computing haven't had much to do with personal computers. Instead, many of the most exciting and popular inventions have been designed to let you carry a copy of the data that's on the PC you already have. What's an iPod, for example, but a $300 portable hard drive containing a copy of your PC's music files? What's a Palm or PocketPC but a $300 data bucket for carrying away a copy of the PC's calendar and address book? And what's a BlackBerry but a $400 mirror image of the PC's e-mail?
10/14/2004	Be Commander in Chief Of a 30-Foot Radius	Multimedia keyboards that can control your digital-audio software and other programs have been around for a while, but the new Belkin MediaPilot keyboard can reach all the way across the living room to control the CD player, TV and other devices in the home entertainment center. An integrated remote control on the keyboard can direct eight different machines and can learn the infrared codes needed to do it from a wide variety of audio and video components.
10/13/2004	F.T.C. Files First Lawsuit Against Spyware Concerns	The Federal Trade Commission formally announced yesterday its first assault against spyware -- bits of computer code that surreptitiously install themselves on the computers of Internet users to track their activities, push them to Web sites, barrage them with advertisements, and otherwise wreak havoc with their machines. The commission filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New Hampshire last week against Sanford Wallace, the owner of Seismic Entertainment Productions and Smartbot.net, contending that Mr. Wallace and his companies had violated federal law, which prohibits ''unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
10/11/2004	Microsoft hopes Windows, its forte, can turn around its venture into the living room.	TELEVISION has been something of a great white whale for the Microsoft Corporation. The company has tried to sell WebTV and build software for TV's and cable boxes. It has even invested billions in cable systems. So far, these efforts have been expensive and have not yet put Microsoft into the position it covets: the maker of the software behind every glowing screen. Tomorrow, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, ventures into Hollywood to announce a renewed assault on a different front in his war of the tube, one that builds on Microsoft's greatest strength: Windows.
10/11/2004	Sampling a World of New Ways to Grapple With the Web	At the moment, at least eight different Web browsers reside in my computer. There's no earthly reason to have so many except for the slightly obsessive fun of it. And these are just the non-arcane browsers -- the ones that didn't ask me to install supporting programs I don't understand. I've also resisted the temptation to build my own browser, which is the kind of project computer magazines like to publish. I know what my do-it-yourself browser would look like. The decals would be crooked and the paint would have fingerprints on it, just like the model airplanes I built as a kid. The number and diversity of these browsers is, to me, a very hopeful sign. Not that long ago, Microsoft and Netscape were fighting for control of the computer desktop, a battle that still goes on in one form or another. Microsoft argued that only a browser tightly integrated with the rest of the operating system could deliver the seamless, gratifying Web-browsing experience most people hope for.
10/10/2004	The Remix; CONSOLE PRIZE	As computers become smarter, so does their design. Microsoft asked the San Francisco design firm One & Company to draft a plan for a better mousetrap for its Media Center PC. The computer prototype runs a specialized version of Windows that transforms it into a multimedia entertainment box that can record and play back television shows; organize digital music, photo and gaming collections; and play DVD's, as well as doing all the regular things a PC can do. It is even hooked up to a television rather than a monitor, and is controlled via remote rather than a mouse.
10/7/2004	E-Mail Friend or Foe? Filters May Not Know	Q. People sometimes tell me that their spam filter has blocked my e-mail messages, even though we have e-mailed before. Is there anything I can do to keep my messages from being blocked or marked as suspect? A. With the flurry of bulk junk mail clogging the Internet, a strong set of spam filters can make life easier. Getting stuck unintentionally on the wrong side of the spam filter can be maddening. There are a few things you can do to help your message get through, but you may be at the mercy of the intended recipient's filtering program.
10/7/2004	Taking Their Game to the Next Level	MASSAGING his hands like a pianist preparing for a concert, Zyos steadied himself on the plain metal chair, staring intently at the television perched on a table in front of him. Oblivious to the small crowd of spectators, he prepared to make his move. Suddenly his fingers darted across his keypad, rapidly pushing the colored buttons as he maneuvered his character in Halo, the Xbox first-person shooter game from Microsoft.
10/3/2004	Tinker With Your Computer, and Reap the Rewards	ANYONE who has used a computer knows that advanced technology both saves and squanders time. The Internet is an obvious example. You can save 10 minutes paying checks online and blow an hour checking blogs. At the dawn of the personal computer age, the writer Stephen Manes introduced the term ''fritterware'' to describe programs and systems that let you feel very busy -- adjusting fonts and settings, tweaking color schemes or screen-saver graphics -- without being productive in any normal sense. It is therefore with both guilt and nervousness that I mention the existence of programs that can improve on the usual, built-in ways of getting things done on a computer -- but that take some tinkering to set up, luring the weak into a cycle of further frittering. Please imagine the rest of this column being delivered in the tone of an N.R.A. instructional video about a child's first weapon: ''Always remember, Bobby, a rifle is not a toy.''
10/2/2004	European Judge Questions Moves Against Microsoft	The judge in Microsoft's appeal of the antitrust measures imposed by the European Commission questioned the wisdom of those moves as the two-day hearing wound up Friday. Judge Bo Vesterdorf of the European Court of First Instance appeared skeptical of the open-ended nature and practical effect of the sanctions as he questioned lawyers for Microsoft, its competitors and the European Commission.
10/1/2004	Microsoft Asks Appeals Court In Europe to Delay Punishment	Microsoft, seeking to stave off legal sanctions aimed at hindering its ability to dominate markets for desktop media players and server software, warned a European appeals court on Thursday that software developers and consumers would face dire consequences should it be penalized. Speaking at the start of a two-day hearing before the European Court of First Instance, Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, asked the court to delay until the end of the appeals process moves aimed at forcing the company to change its practices drastically. That process is expected to last at least two years.
9/30/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Sell Cheaper Windows In India	Microsoft said yesterday that it would sell a cheaper version of Windows software in India to make it more affordable there. The cheaper Windows XP Starter Edition will start selling in India by early next year, Rajiv Kaul, managing director of Microsoft's India unit, told reporters in New Delhi. He declined to give the price of the software.
9/28/2004	Virgin to Offer Space Flights (Even, Sort of, at Discount)	Sir Richard Branson, owner of the Virgin Group, announced on Monday that he would offer travelers the chance to go to the edge of space beginning in 2007, for $190,000 a ticket. Joining with Burt Rutan, the aircraft designer, and Paul G. Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, Sir Richard will form a company called Virgin Galactic to offer suborbital flights into space. During the three-hour trip, passengers will be able to view the earth from 80 miles up, experience weightlessness for around four minutes and perhaps have a cocktail.
9/28/2004	Microsoft Weighs Resuming Negotiations With Europe	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software maker, said yesterday that it might restart settlement talks with European Union regulators after Europe's second-highest court ruled on whether penalties should be suspended. ''We recognize that people have issues that they want to see addressed and we are prepared to address them,'' Microsoft's general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, told reporters yesterday in Brussels. ''We recognize that these issues are best addressed through face-to-face discussions.''
9/27/2004	European Court Reviews 2 Cases Central to Issue Of Competition	This week, with just over a month left in office, Mario Monti, Europe's antitrust chief, faces a crucial test of his rulings against MCI and Microsoft. On Tuesday, the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, Europe's second-highest court, will decide whether Mr. Monti was right in June 2000 to prohibit MCI from taking over Sprint. And two days later, the first hearing in Microsoft's appeal against the European Commission's antitrust ruling against it in March will get under way in the same court.
9/24/2004	Corrections	The State of the Art column in Circuits yesterday, about Microsoft's security enhancements to the Windows XP operating system, misstated the Web address for free downloads of Ad-Aware, a program offering protection against spyware. It is www.lavasoftusa.com.
9/24/2004	Technology Briefing | Digital Media: Qualcomm-Microsoft Deal	Qualcomm and Microsoft said yesterday that they had reached an agreement that would let customers play digital audio and video files created with Microsoft Windows Media software on wireless devices that use Qualcomm's chips. Terms were not disclosed. Qualcomm will add the capability into chips with its Qtv program. The feature will be added in the first quarter of 2005, the companies said.
9/23/2004	Company's Coming? The Family Shutterbug Can Be Prepared	Anticipating the holiday season, when digital still and video cameras will be in heavy use, Adobe has introduced new video-editing software for home users and digital photo-editing software that includes a program for organizing and sharing images. The home video-editing program, Adobe Premier Elements ($100), is intended to simplify editing home movies for Windows XP users. The program can perform some repetitive tasks automatically: it downloads your footage in one step and assembles the sections sequentially, freeing you from having to put them in order manually (though they can still be rearranged to suit your narrative needs). The program also automatically cuts out blank space.
9/23/2004	10 Ways to Secure Data That Belong to You Alone	As the storage capacity of computers has soared, parking data, whether spreadsheets or snapshots, has become less of a problem. But what if the data is for your eyes only? Micro Solutions says the answer is at the tip of your finger. Its new LockBox, 80- to 200-gigabyte external hard drives, have built-in fingerprint readers.
9/23/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Immersion Says Sony Unit Must Pay $82 Million	A unit of the Sony Corporation, the world's second-largest consumer electronics maker, must pay $82 million to the computer software developer Immersion for patent infringement, a jury in Oakland, Calif., found, Immersion said Tuesday. No judgment has been entered and the federal case can be appealed, Immersion said. Immersion filed a lawsuit in 2002 against Sony Computer Entertainment and Microsoft, saying the companies improperly used patented technology owned by Immersion in their video game systems. Last year, Immersion said Microsoft agreed to pay $26 million in exchange for licensing rights to Immersion patents. Sony's American depository receipts, each representing one ordinary share, fell 60 cents yesterday, to $33.84. Immersion shares rose 38 cents, to $6.20.
9/23/2004	Making Windows More Secure	THEY labor long hours to write their software, testing and perfecting it. They toil in obscurity, fully aware that they'll never get credit for their work. Their programs will never make it to computer stores, and they'll never receive a penny for their efforts. They're the virus writers. And it would be nice if they'd cultivate some other hobbies.
9/20/2004	Attacks on Windows PC's Grew in First Half of 2004	A survey of Internet vulnerabilities to be released Monday shows a sharp jump in attacks on Windows-based personal computers during the first six months of 2004, along with a marked increase in commercially motivated threats. The Internet Security Threat Report says that from Jan. 1 to June 30 there were at least 1,237 newly discovered software vulnerabilities, or flaws that could compromise security. That translates into an average of 48 new vulnerabilities a week.
9/20/2004	A Music Download Site For Artists Less Known	The Internet has long carried the promise of being an outlet for new writers, artists and independent musicians. But to David Pakman, chief operating officer of eMusic, an online music service, that promise has not yet panned out. Indeed, for many musicians not affiliated with one of the major record labels, Mr. Pakman says, it has become increasingly hard to get noticed on online music stores, which tend to sell the same music as the megastores.
9/20/2004	Some Microsoft Customers Will Get to See Office Code	Microsoft plans to announce today that it will give dozens of governments and international agencies access to the programming code in its Office desktop software, including word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and e-mail programs. The move is the latest step by Microsoft to share its technology more openly with large customers in response to the rising popularity of open-source software like the Linux operating system.
9/20/2004	Microsoft Co-Founder Puts Different Spin on Sports	When Paul G. Allen's company, Vulcan Inc., acquired The Sporting News four years ago, it seemed an odd fit. Mr. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft and a sports mogul, was a firm believer in the power of the Web to change lives, and his investments reflected that. The Sporting News, a 118-year-old brand and perennial also-ran to Sports Illustrated, seemed like a horse and buggy in a garage filled with Segways. But Mr. Allen had a plan: to leverage The Sporting News magazine with his other properties and pipe content into millions of homes via TV, radio and the Web.
9/16/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Lawyers' Fees Cut In Microsoft Case	A judge cut in half a $268 million request for fees from lawyers who represented California consumers in an antitrust suit that resulted in a $1.1 billion settlement with Microsoft. Judge Paul H. Alvarado of California Superior Court in San Francisco told Microsoft in an order last week to pay the lawyers $112.5 million. The award is about $35 million more than what Microsoft suggested in court filings. The California suit, filed in 2000, accused Microsoft of overcharging for PC software by maintaining a monopoly over its Windows operating system. The case was settled last year. Microsoft has settled similar suits in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Consumer suits are still pending in Iowa, Nebraska, New York and Wisconsin. ''We think the judge did a very thoughtful job, carefully and properly applying California law, and the class counsel received a fair award,'' a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Desler, said. The award includes $101 million in fees and $11.5 million in expenses to be shared among lawyers at 31 law firms, including Townsend & Townsend & Crew, based in San Francisco. Under the antitrust settlement, California purchasers of Microsoft products will receive vouchers ranging from $5 to $29 that can be used to buy any manufacturer's personal-computer hardware or software. Two-thirds of the unclaimed vouchers will go to California schools in low-income areas. Judge Alvarado wrote that the lawyers in the case derived many of their claims from previous antitrust cases against Microsoft.
9/16/2004	Take Along the Music In All Its Many Formats	Q. Are there digital audio players that support not only MP3, WAV and Apple Lossless file formats, but also SHN and FLAC files? A. Digital audio file formats abound on the Internet, and two types that are becoming more common as a result of legal online sharing of concert recordings are Shorten, or SHN, and Free Lossless Audio Codec, FLAC. While you can usually find a software program to play the files on your desktop computer, finding a portable audio player that can understand some of the lesser-known formats can still be a bit of a challenge.
9/15/2004	Yahoo to Buy Online Music Seller for $160 Million	In a move to expand its role in the online music business, Yahoo announced yesterday that it would buy Musicmatch, a company that sells music online, for $160 million. The move puts Yahoo in direct competition with Apple Computer's iTunes, Microsoft's new music store and RealNetworks in the small but growing market for online downloads of music. Yahoo already has a significant advertiser-supported free music business, with Internet radio and music video channels, along with information and discussion boards about music. The services are based on technology it acquired with Launch Media, which it bought in 2001 for $12 million. Yahoo has also introduced an Internet radio service that offers more choices and better sound quality but charges a fee. But until now, it has not offered users the ability to buy and download songs.
9/14/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft And Polycom Plan Venture	Microsoft and Polycom are scheduled to announce today a multiyear development and marketing partnership intended to combine further existing audio and videoconferencing technology with personal computers. The first offering from the two companies, available later this year, will bring Microsoft's instant messaging technology to a range of Polycom audio and videoconferencing devices. By 2006, the companies plan to offer the ability to start a conference session from desktop applications like Microsoft Office with a few clicks of a computer mouse, said Anupam Sahai, the director of system architecture and technology for Polycom. As part of the alliance, Polycom, a leader in phone- and video-conferencing for corporations, will endorse Session Initiation Protocol, a standard for collaboration software that Microsoft is backing. Steve Lohr (NYT)
9/13/2004	Speech Code From I.B.M. To Become Open Source	I.B.M. plans to announce today that it will contribute some of its speech-recognition software to two open-source software groups. The move is a tactical step by International Business Machines to accelerate the development of speech applications and to outmaneuver rivals, especially Microsoft, in a market that is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years with increased use in customer-service call centers, cars and elsewhere. To do this, I.B.M. is again using the strategy of placing some of its proprietary software in open-source projects, making it available for other programmers to improve.
9/9/2004	Putting Suspect Files In Solitary Confinement	Q. What is the difference between a repaired virus and a quarantined one? A. A computer virus, like its biological counterpart, can spread quickly and infect normal files and documents with malicious material that can cause all kinds of problems, from garbling the data within to making the file impossible to open. Most antivirus programs have the ability to fix infected files by neutralizing and removing the malevolent code and then returning the file to its uninfected state; this is typically called a repair.
9/9/2004	The Tablet PC Takes Its Place in the Classroom	TABLET PC's have been around for almost two years now, and while they have not yet proved to be the revolutionary change agents that they were billed as in November 2002, they are starting to carve a niche for themselves in certain corners of the digital world. Industries like health care and insurance have embraced tablet PC's, which can speed the processing of records and forms. While tablets, which account for only about 1 percent of the market for notebook computers, are still generally more expensive than laptops with comparable specifications, prices have started to fall. And last month, Microsoft released an updated version of its Windows XP Tablet PC operating system that offers improved handwriting recognition, addressing one of the chief complaints about the earlier version.
9/6/2004	MediaTalk; When This Book Argued for Shift In Antitrust Policy, Its Subject Smiled	''The Keystone Advantage,'' a business book published two weeks ago, is creating an admiring stir within the not-inconsiderable cottage industry of academics and consultants who study innovation, competition and corporate strategy. It also comes with a recommendation from one of its chief subjects: Bill Gates of Microsoft. The book -- by Marco Iansiti, a professor at the Harvard Business School, and Roy Levien, a technology consultant -- looks at markets and competition through the prism of biology, especially the ''keystones'' (species or companies) that serve as the hubs of biological or economic ecosystems. But the most provocative part of the book is the argument that antitrust policy needs to be rethought. Keystone companies, they say, are powerful yet benevolent. They never dominate industries, the authors insist, but enable larger economic ecosystems to thrive.
9/2/2004	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Sun Cuts Prices On Some Computers	Sun Microsystems, the No.3 maker of computers that run corporate networks, cut prices on some models as much as 35 percent to reclaim market share from its rivals I.B.M. and Dell. The discounts on servers and workstations run through Nov. 30 and apply to computers using Linux or Microsoft Windows operating systems and running on semiconductors from either Sun or Advanced Micro Devices, Sun said yesterday.
9/2/2004	A Windows IPod Experience (Don't Forget the Tattoo)	It is not blue and they are not calling it the hPod, but Hewlett-Packard announced last week that it was finally releasing its answer to Apple Computer's iPod digital music player, originally promised earlier this year. Now known officially as the Apple iPod From HP, the music player will be available in early September at hpshopping.com and at Best Buy, CompUSA, Radio Shack and Costco. ''We are taking digital music to the mass market,'' said Vyomesh Joshi, an executive vice president at Hewlett-Packard, who said the company wanted to tailor the iPod experience for the Windows user. The Apple iPod From HP is essentially the same white hardware as the most recent version of the iPod from Apple, available with either a 20-gigabyte hard drive ($300) or a 40-gigabyte drive ($400) to hold songs and data.
9/2/2004	Letting Gamers Play God, and Now Themselves	THE first thing Peter Molyneux asks someone who has played Fable, his newest video game, is not whether they like it, but what kind of person they were when they played it. Were they kind or cruel? Had they married? If so, how many times? Had they courted fame or skulked in shadows? ''What kind of hero were you?'' Mr. Molyneux asks, trying to divine what kind of person stands before him.
9/2/2004	Microsoft Challenges Rivals With New Online Music Service	Microsoft started selling music tracks yesterday on its MSN online service, taking on Apple Computer and a host of others in the fast-growing market for digital music. The much-anticipated new service, called MSN Music, is a significant milestone for Microsoft as it tries to expand into a digital entertainment powerhouse. So far, downloaded music accounts for only 2 percent of all music sales in the United States, but analysts expect the market to take off in the next few years.
9/2/2004	From Microsoft, a First Take	IF you're trying to figure out if somebody is a gadget freak, try this simple test: work the phrase ''video iPod'' into a sentence. If the subject hyperventilates, salivates or passes out, you'll know. After all, surely the only thing more divine than a shiny, pocket-size trinket that plays music (like the iPod and its brethren) would be a shiny, pocket-size trinket that also plays TV and movies.
9/2/2004	Problems Printing? One Error Decoded	Q. What is Spool32? It often shows up in error messages when I try to print. A. Spool32.exe is a small program used by older versions of the Windows operating system, including Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME. The primary responsibility of Spool32 is to manage files that have been sent to the printer.
9/2/2004	Missing Link for the Mac User Who Craves a BlackBerry	As the BlackBerry wireless e-mail device has grown into a full-fledged computer, it has left Macintosh users behind. The software provided by Research in Motion, BlackBerry's maker, for synchronizing address book and calendar data runs only on Windows-based computers. Now Information Appliance Associates, a company that makes software for linking Macs with PocketPC devices, has a $30 piece of software for Mac users who want to be BlackBerry owners.
9/2/2004	Is Portable Video Ready for Its Close-Up?; Music on a Hand-Held Was a Sensation, But for Movies, Stardom May Be Tougher	A FEW years ago, when MP3 players were establishing themselves as the hot cool thing, the next question seemed clear: What if you could take along not only music but movies, television programs, home video and still pictures in a high-tech box svelte enough to slip into a briefcase, backpack or purse, or perhaps a pocket? An answer is beginning to emerge, however tentatively.
8/30/2004	Can Microsoft Stomp iTunes With a Store Of Its Own?	When Microsoft unveils its online music store later this week, the first song offered should be Dave Brubeck's ''It's Déjà Vu All Over Again.'' For Microsoft, taking a trail blazed by others -- then trying to dominate the market -- is a familiar tune. With the opening on Thursday, Microsoft will land itself in a market that Apple Computer pioneered more than a year ago with its iTunes online music store, in much the same way that it took on Netscape in the Web browser business and Sony in the market for console game machines. As a storefront on the MSN online service, Microsoft's music service will offer song tracks for downloading to personal computers and portable music players.
8/28/2004	Next Version of Windows For PC's to Ship in 2006	Microsoft laid out its plan yesterday for shipping the next version of its Windows operating system for personal computers in 2006, but to meet its timetable the company has scaled back its technological ambitions for the product. The decision, analysts say, represents a pragmatic blend of business and technical considerations. Microsoft's last major release of its desktop operating system, Windows XP, was in 2001, and the timing for the new version, code-named Longhorn, had been slipping. The five-year gap is a long one for Microsoft, which has traditionally shipped a new version of Windows every three or four years.
8/28/2004	Suit by Cities Says Microsoft Overcharged	Microsoft, which has agreed to pay $1.8 billion to settle consumer antitrust suits, has been sued by California munciplaties, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, over claims that the company overcharged them for its Windows software. The suit by six California municipalities seeks to represent all government agencies in the state. Microsoft settled a California consumer suit last year that made similar legal claims. Government entities were excluded from the $1.1 billion settlement.
8/26/2004	Europe Opens Another Inquiry Involving Microsoft	The European Commission has opened an investigation into the planned acquisition of ContentGuard Holdings by Microsoft and Time Warner, a commission spokeswoman said Wednesday. ContentGuard specializes in software that protects digital material from counterfeiting. Microsoft is already the world's largest supplier of digital rights management software, which comes packaged with the latest version of its audio- and video-playing software, Media Player.
8/26/2004	A Navigator on the Windshield Charts Your Course	Not all who wander need be lost. Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2005, the latest version of the popular travel planning software, has arrived. In the $129 package, Microsoft bundles a small Global Positioning System device that puts the program's detailed road maps into better context. Now, not only can you plot trips and get additional information, you can do so en route. Streets and Trips covers 5.4 million miles of roads and identifies 1.8 million points of interest in the United States and Canada. The addition of G.P.S. makes it easier to find your current position; check on speed, bearing and elevation; see how far you have come; and get updated directions. Online updates for road construction and closures increase the odds that the suggested route is quickest.
8/24/2004	Microsoft Quits a U.N. Standards Group	Microsoft on Monday withdrew from a United Nations software standards group for commerce, citing ''business reasons.'' Earlier this year, Microsoft's participation had created controversy within the group, which is attempting to define standards for creating a new generation of Internet services to automate buying and selling through networks of computers.
8/20/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Sony Cuts Playstation 2 Price In Europe	The Sony Corporation cut the price of its PlayStation 2 machine by a quarter in Europe, after reductions by its rival Microsoft before the Christmas season. A PlayStation 2 now sells for ?104.99 ($192) in Britain and 149 euros ($184) in countries using the common European currency, Tokyo-based Sony said yesterday on its Web site. Sony reduced United States prices in May. The reduction is the latest step in the price war between PlayStation 2 and Xbox in the $8 billion console industry. Microsoft said yesterday that it would cut the Xbox's price to 149.99 euros in Europe, starting at the end of the month. PlayStation was introduced in 1994. In three years, it became the world's top game machine, beating those of Nintendo and Sega Enterprises Inc., now Sega. The first PlayStation models, still on the market, have sold more than 100 million units. The successor, PlayStation 2, has sold more than 70 million, including 24 million outside of Japan and North America, according to Sony. Xbox, introduced in November 2001, trails with 15.5 million units sold worldwide so far.
8/19/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Interactive World Cup To Be Announced	Microsoft, Electronic Arts and FIFA, the worldwide governing body of soccer, are expected to announce today the FIFA Interactive World Cup at the Leipzig Games Convention in Germany. The three-month worldwide contest, which will be held from October until December, will involve a soccer video game tournament using Electronic Arts' FIFA Football 2005 played on Microsoft's Xbox console and Xbox Live online service. The finals of the tournament will be played in Zurich in December in conjunction with the announcement of the world soccer player of the year. Electronic Arts has been successful with its FIFA-branded line of soccer games for Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony platforms, but this is the first year the company had made its games available for the Xbox Live. Jack Bell (NYT)
8/17/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Software Review Extended	The European Commission has extended its review of a joint initiative by Microsoft and Time Warner to develop antipiracy software, a spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said. The companies said in April that they planned to buy Contentguard, a unit of Xerox that makes software to protect digital material such as music and video from illegal copying. The commission was expected to decide today whether to approve the deal or start an investigation. That deadline has been put back to Aug. 25, Ms. Torres said. She would not say why, but such a delay usually means that the commission is assessing changes to the deal by the companies involved. Paul Meller (NYT)
8/16/2004	Everything but the Potted Plant; An Ambitious Package To Raise Productivity (And Microsoft's Profit)	To most of the computer-using world, Microsoft Office is the familiar workhorse of the desktop, a collection of software for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations. But for Microsoft, which is starting to see its growth slow as it ages, reinventing that suite of old reliables -- including Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- has become nothing less than a key to its future.
8/16/2004	Trying to Take Technology To the Masses	Raj Reddy was fed up debating the problem of the digital divide between the rich and the poor and decided to do something about it. Mr. Reddy, a pioneering researcher in artificial intelligence and a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, plans to unveil at the end of this year his new project, called the PCtvt, a $250 wirelessly networked personal computer intended for the four billion people around the world who live on less than $2,000 a year.
8/12/2004	In Search of a Browser That Banishes Clutter	FOR Katherine Sandlin, a barrage of pop-up ads was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back -- in this case, her reliance on Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Even before her home page could load, thumbnail-size advertisements would crowd the monitor urging her to apply for a credit card or find love online. So she asked around for other ways to browse the Web.
8/7/2004	Corrections	An article in World Business on July 28 about a court hearing with Microsoft, the European Commission and others, to decide whether changes demanded by the commission in Microsoft's business practices should be waived pending an appeal, misstated the name of a group that supports the commission in the case. It is the Free Software Foundation Europe, not the Free Software Federation of Europe.
8/6/2004	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Microsoft And Verizon Wireless Plan Venture	Microsoft, which is expanding its MSN Internet offerings to attract paying customers, will work with Verizon Wireless to sell an instant messaging and e-mail service on mobile phones. MSN Mobile will be available on three phones with Verizon's Get It Now technology for $2.49 a month for three months and $2.99 after that. Users can communicate with computers and cellphones using MSN's free Hotmail e-mail and MSN Messenger instant messaging programs, Microsoft said yesterday. Microsoft and Verizon, the nation's largest mobile phone operator, aim to increase sales by attracting customers who are buying Internet- and camera-enabled phones. The number of worldwide customers using mobile phones once a week for tasks other than phone calls will quadruple in the next year, according to the researcher, A.T. Kearney.
8/5/2004	Gates's Line on Nintendo Gets Lost in German	Misquote? Trial balloon? Or merely proof that humor travels poorly, if at all, between cultures? A German financial magazine, WirtschaftsWoche, reported yesterday that Bill Gates said he was interested in buying Nintendo, the maker of video games and consoles.
8/4/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Settles New Mexico Lawsuit	Microsoft will give $31.5 million in software vouchers to settle a lawsuit by New Mexico consumers who assert they were overcharged for the Windows operating system. The lawsuit claimed that consumers paid higher prices for personal computer software because of Microsoft's Windows monopoly. Consumers will receive vouchers that can be used to purchase any manufacturer's software or computers. Half of any unclaimed vouchers will go to public schools. More than 100 consumer lawsuits were filed after a federal appeals court ruled in 2001 against Microsoft in an antitrust suit brought by the government. Microsoft has agreed to pay at least $1.8 billion to settle consumer antitrust suits in more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia.
8/2/2004	Console Prices Lift Game Sales	Thanks to the new $149 price for Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox, the video game industry has enjoyed an uptick in sales. For the month of June, software sales in dollars increased 12 percent. Sales of all video game products rose 2.5 percent compared with the same month last year, according to data from the NPD Group. When Microsoft and Sony previously lowered their console prices to $179 in 2003, software unit sales increased 14 percent. ''For the last 10 years, we've seen lots of traction when the price drops below $150,'' said Richard Ow, an NPD analyst. Mr. Ow predicted that console prices would fall further, to $129 or $99, within the next 12 months.
8/1/2004	It's BlackBerry Season, but Maybe Not for Long	MAXWELL SMART could hold his shoe to his ear and talk quite naturally. But he was the inimitable Agent 86, and the shoe phone -- the original Smart phone -- was a running gag in the 1960's television comedy ''Get Smart.'' (Operator: ''What is the number of your shoe?'' Smart: ''It's an unlisted shoe, operator!'') Its phone-in-disguise successor is the BlackBerry, the squat, rectangular gizmo that provides e-mail on the go, and includes, incidentally, a cellphone. Holding it to the ear to make a call feels like calling with a wallet, which is about the same size. But when held in both hands to read and fire off e-mail, it works like a dream.
7/30/2004	Pursuing Growth, Microsoft Steps Up Patent Chase	Microsoft said on Thursday that it planned to increase its storehouse of intellectual property by filing 50 percent more patent applications over the next year than in the previous 12 months. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, increasingly regards the legal protection of its programming ideas as essential to safeguarding its growth opportunities.
7/29/2004	Bursting With Functions, A Slimmer Braille Organizer	Since 1988, Pulse Data has carved out a niche as a company supplying high-tech gadgetry to the blind. In addition to Braille-assisted Global Positioning System devices and keyboards for PC's, the company has produced a line of hand-held organizers that it calls Notetakers. Its BrailleNote organizer, introduced in 2000, deployed a Braille keypad in conjunction with proprietary voice-recognition software to do nearly everything a conventional high-end hand-held organizer could. (The model also comes without a Braille display.) Yet the BrailleNote's convenience was largely offset by its clunky size (nearly 10 inches long).
7/28/2004	Court in Europe Set to Hear Microsoft Case	Europe's second-highest appeals court, the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, set a date at the end of September for a meeting with Microsoft, the European Commission and others to decide whether changes demanded by the commission in March to Microsoft's business practices should be waived until its appeal is decided. Microsoft is appealing a ruling that branded it an abusive monopolist, ordered two important changes to the way the company operates, and fined the company 497 million euros, or $604 million, for breaking European antitrust law. Microsoft's appeal is likely to last more than three years.
7/26/2004	Corrections	A front-page article on Wednesday about Microsoft's decision to pay a special $3-a-share dividend misstated the schedule it has followed for its regular dividend, which is being increased. While that will now be paid quarterly, it was previously paid annually.
7/26/2004	RealNetworks Plans to Sell Songs to Be Played on IPod	RealNetworks Inc., the maker of media-playing software, has grown tired of waiting for Apple Computer Inc. to share. Tomorrow, without Apple's authorization, RealNetworks will start to give away software that will allow people to buy and download songs from its online music store and then play them on Apple's popular iPod portable devices in addition to those that use the Windows Media Player format and RealNetworks' Helix format.
7/25/2004	DataBank; Microsoft Creates a Stir, but Markets Retreat	It was another dismal week for the stock market, which declined despite Alan Greenspan's soothing words and a big announcement from Microsoft. Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that the economy's expansion was strong and self-sustaining -- suggesting to some investors that the Fed would aggressively raise interest rates at any sign of mounting inflation. Microsoft announced late on Tuesday that it would pay out $32 billion to shareholders in a one-time special dividend, and would double its regular dividend and buy back up to $30 billion worth of its own shares over the next four years. Its shares soared on Wednesday, but on Thursday it reported earnings and a financial outlook that were worse than analysts expected. The stock dropped on Friday, pulling down the market.
7/24/2004	Microsoft May Sell Slate, a Pioneer in Web Magazines	Microsoft, which announced this week that it would pay a one-time cash dividend worth $32 billion to its shareholders, said yesterday that it was exploring the sale of Slate, a pioneer in digital publishing. According to company executives, Microsoft is considering a sale of Slate because the model of creating a Web magazine of cultural criticism and political analysis to attract visitors to its MSN Network has little business salience in an age dominated by search applications. And the site's small size limits its ability to contribute meaningfully to Microsoft's revenues.
7/24/2004	Microsoft Shares Are Down 3.3%	Shares of Microsoft fell yesterday after a drop in investment income caused fourth-quarter profit to miss analysts' forecasts. The company said lower returns would hurt profit this year. The shares fell 97 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $28.03, in Nasdaq trading. Microsoft said Thursday that profit before an options-related expense and a tax gain was 28 cents a share, missing the 29-cent average prediction of 31 analysts.
7/23/2004	Microsoft Reports Strong Sales Increases for Quarter and Year	Microsoft reported strong quarterly gains in sales and profits yesterday, showing that it is one of the winners in the uneven recovery that the technology sector is experiencing. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said sales rose to $9.29 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year-earlier quarter, and about $300 million higher than Wall Street analysts had expected.
7/23/2004	Microsoft Is Dead. Long Live Microsoft.	Microsoft's decision to return $32 billion to its shareholders may be a wise business move, but it is also an admission of defeat. With its announcement this week that it will pay a special one-time dividend of $3 a share, the company is confessing that despite years of trying, it has not found an attractive way to invest its cash reserves. After decades of spectacular growth, the world's most famous software company seems resigned to a more sedate middle age. Microsoft may be the biggest name in software, but its problem is not unique. In recent weeks, many of the largest suppliers of business software, like Computer Associates, Seibel Systems and Veritas, have announced that their growth will fall short of investors' expectations.
7/22/2004	Strutting Down the Catwalk, A Mouse With a Lighted Stripe	The designer Philippe Starck wants to do for the computer mouse what the iPod did for portable music players: turn it into a fashion statement. Two years ago, Microsoft agreed to let Mr. Starck, who has created modern takes on everything from juicers to motorcycles, see what he could do for the mouse. The collaboration has resulted in the Optical Mouse by Starck, a slick peripheral device.
7/22/2004	The $32 Billion With a Bonus In Tax Breaks	Microsoft's decision to pay a $32 billion special dividend -- by far the largest payout in corporate history -- will create an opportunity for millions of American shareholders to receive income that will be taxed at low rates. But it is also likely to provide an incentive for foreign investors to sell the stock and could create tax-oriented trading in the company's shares. By acting now, Microsoft is ensuring that high-income shareholders, a group that includes Bill Gates, its chairman and co-founder, will receive the $3-a-share dividend before a possible change in the tax laws that could more than double their tax bills on such a payout.
7/22/2004	Apple's Base Station: No Wires, Lots of Bells and Whistles	IN his weekly ''60 Minutes'' commentary a couple of years ago, the inimitable Andy Rooney groused about the number of cables in our lives. ''Look behind the television set in your living room. It's a rat's nest of electrical cords,'' he said. ''All different -- no two the same. If Thomas Edison was so smart, how come he didn't come up with one cord that fits everything?'' Of course, it wouldn't be very hard for Mr. Rooney to answer his own question. To find out why cords are designed to fit only specific connectors, all he'd have to do is plug his headphones into an electrical outlet, just once.
7/22/2004	Companies With Cash Hoards Don't Necessarily Pay It Out	While there was already growing pressure on corporations to increase dividends before Microsoft decided on a one-time payout of $32 billion, investors should not bet that companies with a lot of cash are going to increase or begin paying dividends. Investor interest is clear. American companies have more cash on hand today than they have had since World War II, and the reduction in the federal tax on dividends has spurred interest in paying dividends. In addition, dividends are well below their historic average, and companies have been devoting a smaller part of their earnings to dividends, leaving room to raise them, at least in the eyes of some shareholders.
7/21/2004	MICROSOFT TO PAY SPECIAL DIVIDEND TO STOCKHOLDERS	Microsoft, with more than $50 billion on hand, announced yesterday that it would bestow on its shareholders a special one-time dividend of $3 a share, a payout worth $32 billion. Although other companies have paid special dividends in the past, the size of Microsoft's payout is far and away the largest cash grant in corporate history.
7/20/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Lindows And Microsoft Settle Suit	Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, will pay $20 million to Lindows Inc. to settle a dispute over the use of the company's name, which Microsoft said was too similar to its Windows trademark. Microsoft will gain rights to Lindows.com and other Internet domain names, and Lindows will change its name to Linspire, Lindows said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft had sued Lindows in December 2001, contending that use of Lindows violated its Windows trademark.
7/20/2004	Spam Sender Settles Case In New York	Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, said yesterday that he had reached a settlement with Scott Richter, a prominent Internet marketer whom Mr. Spitzer sued in December on accusations of sending deceptive junk e-mail messages, or spam. Mr. Richter and his company, OptInRealBig.com, agreed to pay a $40,000 fine and $10,000 toward the investigative cost. That is far smaller than the millions in penalties that Mr. Spitzer said he would seek when he filed the case.
7/19/2004	The MSN Butterfly Begins to Break Free	At an October 2002 gala to introduce Microsoft's MSN 8 Internet service, Bill Gates showed a video of himself wearing a butterfly costume and handing out software for the service. His point was that after seven years of floundering in the Internet access market, Microsoft would do whatever it took to beat its longtime rival America Online. That included pouring $500 million into MSN to match AOL's most popular features and another $300 million into marketing, featuring MSN's butterfly mascot and a concert highlighted by rocker Lenny Kravitz singing ''Fly Away.''
7/19/2004	ITunes Shores Up Its Defenses As Rivals Prepare to Invade	When Kevin Britten won Apple Computer's sweepstakes for downloading song number 100 million from the iTunes service last week, the 20-year-old Kansas resident disappointed customers who had been tracking iTunes sales in hopes of winning a Mac, an iPod music player and 10,000 free songs. But with the arrival of new competitors in online music this year and powerful new threats from the Microsoft Corporation and others, Apple is going to have to come up with a lot more than contests to keep market share. The company is focusing on making its music service as much an experience as a store, and is enhancing features to turn casual browsers into repeat customers.
7/16/2004	Corrections	An answer in the Q&A column in Circuits on July 8, about improving the performance of Microsoft Word, transposed the article number dealing with that issue on Microsoft's Web site. It is Article 291476 in the Knowledge Base at support.microsoft.com, not 219476.
7/14/2004	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Microsoft Contract Warning	The Japanese Fair Trade Commission has issued a warning against Microsoft, ruling that the software giant violated antimonopoly laws with a restrictive clause in its contracts with computer makers. Microsoft's Japan unit said the company disagreed with the ruling and planned to appeal. The commission is asking Microsoft to drop a clause from its contracts with computer makers that prevents them from suing Microsoft for patent infringement. Microsoft said it believed there was no problem with the clause but said it would drop it from future contracts. Todd Zaun (NYT)
7/14/2004	Digital Media Standard Is Set By Studios and Gear Makers	Eight of the nation's largest high-technology companies, consumer electronics makers and movie studios are to announce today a system for licensing and distributing movies and other content produced with the latest digital media technology. The collaboration among Intel, I.B.M., Microsoft, Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic, Walt Disney and Time Warner is intended to help prevent the delays and problems that have plagued the rollout of new digital formats in the past.
7/11/2004	Gates and Jobs, Together at Last	Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have been celebrated in books, magazines, newspapers, even a television movie. Now comes musical theater. Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner, authors of ''The Bomb-itty of Errors,'' an award-winning, hip-hop Shakespearean play, have written ''Nerds,'' which they call ''a musical software satire.'' It is to be performed this week at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
7/8/2004	Microsoft On the Trail Of Google	IT must be fun to walk through the Microsoft parking lot, reading the bumper stickers on the cars. Can you imagine what they must say? ''Honk if you love monopolies.'' ''Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean we're not out to get you.'' ''My other car is a Hummer, too.'' But the lawyers' bumper stickers probably say, ''You can't copyright an idea.'' Despite its admirable if largely unsuccessful recent efforts to pioneer product categories -- wireless watches, wireless screens and so on -- Microsoft's greatest hits have been clones of other people's successful work, including Windows (based on the Macintosh), Pocket PC (PalmPilot) and Internet Explorer (Netscape Navigator).
7/7/2004	Amid Belt-Tightening, Microsoft Talks of a Bright Future	In his annual e-mail message to Microsoft's employees yesterday, Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, declared that the personal computer industry and his company were still growth businesses, and he predicted that the number of PC's in use worldwide would increase 60 percent, to one billion, by 2010. But Mr. Ballmer left no doubt that Microsoft must behave more like the mature company it has become to reduce the constant scrutiny it faces from antitrust regulators around the world and the pressure it increasingly faces from investors.
7/5/2004	Knowing Their Politics by Their Software	In a campaign season of polarization, when Republicans and Democrats seem far apart on issues like Iraq, the economy and leadership style, it is perhaps not surprising that the parties find themselves on different sides in the politics of software as well. The Web sites of Senator John Kerry and the Democratic National Committee run mainly on the technology of the computing counterculture: open-source software that is distributed free, and improved and debugged by far-flung networks of programmers.
7/5/2004	No Longer a Solitary Pursuit, Video Games Move Online	Forget the image of the ardent video game player, sitting alone at a console, vanquishing villains. Video games are starting to become a group activity. Equipped with Internet connections, people using video-game consoles like Sony's PlayStation 2 or Microsoft's Xbox, like their brethren using personal computers, can now link with other players online, form alliances and socialize in groups. For Microsoft and Sony, making games and consoles with online features is becoming an important way to generate additional revenue.
7/2/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Settles 2 Consumer Suits	Microsoft will give $184.2 million in software vouchers to consumers in Minnesota and Vermont to settle lawsuits claiming that people were overcharged for the Windows operating system. A state court judge in Minnesota gave preliminary approval to a $174.5 million settlement in that state, which was reached in April during a seven-week trial, the company said. Microsoft has agreed to pay at least $1.8 billion to settle suits with consumers in 14 states.
7/1/2004	Court Lets Settlement Stand In Microsoft Antitrust Case	A federal appeals court handed Microsoft a convincing victory yesterday in the company's long-running campaign to put an end to its antitrust problems, by upholding the settlement the company reached with the government two years ago. Microsoft's general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, hailed the ruling as ''a landmark decision'' that removes a legal cloud over the company, freeing it up to use some of its more than $50 billion in cash to buy back shares or pay larger dividends.
7/1/2004	Microsoft Making Some Changes to Its Internet Search Service	Microsoft is firing a warning shot against Google and Yahoo today in its efforts to compete in the rapidly growing Internet search business. The company will make available to the public an early version of the search engine it has been building. This version, at techpreview.search.msn.com, is meant to be tested by experts and is not yet ready to be compared with its more mature rivals, Microsoft said. The company hopes to have a more advanced preview version by the end of the summer and to introduce its new search engine by the end of the year.
7/1/2004	Microsoft Pays Fine Imposed by Europe	Microsoft has paid the fine of 497.2 million euros ($600 million) imposed on it by European antitrust regulators in March. ''It has been paid in full, not by bank guarantee,'' said Eric Mamer, the European Commission spokesman for budget-related issues. The budget department collects such fines.
6/30/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Settles Suit In Massachusetts	Microsoft will give $34 million in software vouchers to settle an antitrust lawsuit by Massachusetts consumers who claim they were overcharged. Judge Judith Fabricant of Superior Court in Middlesex County gave preliminary approval to the settlement on Monday, the company said. Microsoft agreed to pay $104.6 million to Arizona consumers to settle a similar lawsuit and has paid $1.55 billion to settle suits in 10 other states. Under the settlement, Massachusetts consumers who bought Microsoft products from Jan. 3, 1996, to Dec. 31, 2002, will get vouchers. Massachusetts schools will get half the unclaimed vouchers. More than 100 consumer lawsuits were filed after a federal appeals court in 2001 ruled that Microsoft illegally protected its Windows operating system.
6/29/2004	Microsoft to Offer Streamlined Products Aimed at Programmers	Microsoft owes much of its success to its skillful care and feeding of software developers, making it comparatively easy and inexpensive to write programs that run on the company's franchise product, the Windows operating system. But Microsoft now faces rising competition for the allegiance of developers, especially from open source software like Linux, which have code and programming tools that are distributed free.
6/28/2004	Europeans Delay Enforcement of Order Against Microsoft	The European Commission said on Sunday that it would not enforce a Monday deadline for ordering Microsoft to start selling a modified version of its Windows operating system. The commission said it would wait until after a European appeals court in Luxembourg has had its say on whether to suspend the order. Last week, Microsoft asked the Court of First Instance for a suspension of the order as it appeals the commission's antitrust ruling in March.
6/28/2004	One Small Step In Uphill Fight As Linux Adds A Media Player	GNU Linux, the free computer operating system, has had far more success in winning converts in corporate data centers than on desktop personal computers. But as more user-friendly software makes its way onto the Linux desktop, the free operating system is starting to make progress in its David-vs.-Goliath competition against Microsoft, the dominant power in PC software. Another step in the progress of Linux in personal computers will come today, when two large Linux distributors, Red Hat and Novell, are expected to announce that they will ship the media-playing software of RealNetworks in their Linux desktop products.
6/25/2004	Microsoft to Soon Seek Stay Of Ruling by Europeans	With less than a week to go until a European antitrust ruling is scheduled to take effect, Microsoft is about to ask the second-highest court in Europe to block the order temporarily. When it ruled against the company in March, the European Commission gave Microsoft 90 days to develop an alternate version of the Windows operating system for sale in Europe.
6/24/2004	'The Next Slide, Please,' Accomplished Wirelessly	Business travelers have a new wireless gadget for overseas meetings: the RemotePoint Global Presenter from Interlink Electronics. Recently upgraded to the 2.4-gigahertz international standard, this palm-size controller can be used in the United States and abroad to run a PowerPoint presentation from a PC up to 100 feet away.
6/24/2004	Microsoft Tells Court It Won't Be a Rival to Oracle	A top executive of the Microsoft Corporation testified on Wednesday that the company has no plans to compete in the enterprise software market, bolstering the government's case that the market is far less competitive than Oracle contends. The testimony from Douglas J. Burgum, a senior vice president at Microsoft, who was subpoenaed by the government, came in the third week of a trial in Federal District Court over the Justice Department's attempt to block Oracle's $7.7 billion hostile takeover of PeopleSoft.
6/23/2004	4 Rivals Near Agreement on Ways to Fight Spam	Four large Internet service providers agreed yesterday to a partial truce in their battle with one another over potential technology to stop junk e-mail in hopes that they can devote their united energy to fighting spam. More than a year ago the four providers -- America Online, Yahoo, EarthLink and Microsoft -- said that they would work together to create technical standards that could verify the identity of the sender of an e-mail message.
6/18/2004	Oracle, Seeking PeopleSoft, Says It Is Forced to Compete Broadly	PeopleSoft sometimes competes against companies other than Oracle and SAP for big software customers, a PeopleSoft executive said yesterday at the federal antitrust trial involving Oracle's proposed $7.7 billion takeover of PeopleSoft. W. Phillip Wilmington, an executive vice president of PeopleSoft, said during questioning that his company lost accounts to suppliers like Lawson Software of St. Paul. The losses were usually for sales at corporate divisions and did not mean that Lawson was a viable competitor at large companies, he said.
6/17/2004	While Sipping a Latte, Lap Up Your Favorite Show	For those whose tastes run to watching television on the go, EOps Technology has introduced the world of hand-held computers to the TV CF Card for Pocket PC's. The device, a tuner that picks up broadcast signals, plugs into the CompactFlash slot of compatible Pocket PC's, allowing the user to watch local broadcast programming on the small screen.
6/16/2004	Evidence of High-Skill Work Going Abroad	In the debate over high-technology work migrating abroad, there has been widespread agreement on at least one thing: the jobs requiring higher levels of skill are the least at risk. Routine software programming and testing jobs, analysts agree, are the ones most susceptible to being grabbed by fast-growing Indian outsourcing companies. By contrast, the people who devise the early blueprints for projects -- the software architects -- have been regarded as far less likely to see their jobs farmed out.
6/15/2004	Making Science Fact, Now Chronicling Science Fiction	Donna L. Shirley used to run NASA's Mars exploration program. Now she is doing something even more far out. Ms. Shirley, who retired from NASA in 1998, is director of the new Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame here, set to open on June 18. Instead of pointing space probes at the next rock out from the Sun, she now oversees exhibits exploring the universe of ''What if?,'' from genetic engineering to aliens to parallel worlds.
6/14/2004	Its Brief Fling With Microsoft Makes SAP Almost Famous	For Henning Kagermann, the chief executive of SAP, the disclosure by Microsoft last Monday that it had held merger talks with his software company could not have come at a more awkward moment. Mr. Kagermann was flying to a conference near San Diego, where the guest list included Steven P. Jobs of Apple Computer, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard, and Bill Gates, the man whose company had started all the tongues wagging.
6/14/2004	Corrections	The Patents column in Business Day last Monday, about a dispute over the patent for the technology of the BlackBerry hand-held wireless device, included an executive erroneously among those who use it. Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, does not.
6/10/2004	News and Maps On the Go, Size Small	Many Web sites and services now provide online material tailored for the tiny screens and slower download speeds of palmtop computers and smart phones. A new service from Handmark Software offers information formatted for small screens, but with a twist: no Web browser software is involved. The service, called Handmark Express, delivers news, weather, movie schedules, stock prices, sports scores, maps, driving directions and telephone directory assistance.
6/9/2004	Microsoft Files an Appeal In European Antitrust Case	Microsoft said Tuesday that it had filed an appeal of the European antitrust ruling against it, saying that the regulators' remedies would undermine innovation. The company also said it would seek a suspension of the changes demanded by the commission. The filing, with the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, Europe's second-highest court, is not publicly available. In a statement, Microsoft's associate general counsel for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Horacio Gutiérrez, said the ruling would burden the company with obligations to license its proprietary technology to rivals.
6/9/2004	Market Place; SAP is looking mightier, not more vulnerable, after disclosures that it flirted with Microsoft.	AT the annual meeting of Deutsche Bank here last week, Henning Kagermann sat silently on the dais with other board members as a stream of shareholders voiced fears that the bank, Germany's largest, would be sold to a foreign predator. On Monday, Mr. Kagermann's software company, SAP, disclosed that it, too, had flirted with the idea of being acquired by an American corporate titan, Microsoft. Those talks ended without a deal, yet SAP has emerged from the dalliance looking mightier, not more vulnerable.
6/8/2004	Microsoft Likely to Win Stay of European Ruling	Microsoft is expected to win an immediate temporary stay of European regulators' order that the company sell a version of its Windows operating system without Media Player software included, lawyers based in Brussels said Monday. Such a request for a temporary injunction is often honored in antitrust cases, the lawyers noted, and at the very least, it would give Microsoft several months before it would have to comply with the European antitrust order. But such an approval by the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg would be no indication of how the court would rule later this year on the question of a permanent suspension of regulators' remedies, the lawyers said.
6/8/2004	Microsoft Says It Wooed SAP, and Oracle Trial Takes Note	In a trial that promises to shed light on the private dealings of the computer software industry, the first bombshell dropped yesterday even before the courtroom doors opened in San Francisco. Microsoft issued a press release early yesterday morning saying that it had held discussions with SAP, the big German maker of business software, about buying that company. The merger talks began late last year, the terse statement explained, but Microsoft broke off the negotiations after weighing the ''complexity of the potential transaction'' and the management headaches of trying to put together two huge software companies.
6/3/2004	Oracle Croons a New Tune About an Old Rival	In business, competitors are routinely cast as enemies to be fought and ridiculed. And over the years Oracle, led by its shoot-from-the-lip chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, has directed vast quantities of combative energy and invective at Microsoft -- a software maker led by a man even richer than Mr. Ellison, Bill Gates. But when Oracle squares off against the Justice Department over its proposed hostile takeover of PeopleSoft in Federal District Court in San Francisco next Monday, it will portray Microsoft as a guardian of competition and a welcome new entrant in the $25-billion-a-year global market for the back-office software that companies use to manage finances, human resources, procurement, sales and customer relations.
6/1/2004	Sun Alters Its Pricing Strategy For Sales to Developing Nations	Sun Microsystems plans on Tuesday to announce a new pricing model for selling to governments of developing nations based on population size and degree of industrialization. Sun, a computer maker based in Silicon Valley, has struggled in recent years as corporate spending stalled and dot-com and telecommunications companies went into deep recessions.
5/31/2004	When Software Fails to Stop Spam, It's Time to Bring In the Detectives	Sterling McBride spends a lot of time waiting for spammers to make a mistake. They usually do. When he hunted down escaped prisoners for the United States Marshals Service, Mr. McBride learned the value of lying low until fugitives trip up, leaving small clues on their whereabouts. Now, as an investigator for Microsoft, Mr. McBride watches carefully for tidbits of data that link some of the two billion pieces of junk e-mail that Microsoft's Hotmail service receives each day with the people who send them.
5/27/2004	Corrections	The State of the Art column in Circuits last Thursday, about a new version of Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, misstated the origin of a feature in the software's PowerPoint component. The feature, a slide-show aid called Presenter Tools, has a counterpart (called Presenter View) in PowerPoint for Windows; it is not an innovation for the Mac.
5/26/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Challenging Linux	Microsoft has begun an effort to produce a version of Windows for high-performance computing, a move seen as a direct attack on a Linux stronghold. For now, Linux has the upper hand, owing to its affinity with Unix -- the operating system environment the high-performance crowd is most comfortable with -- and the open-source model, which lets users turn directly to source code for answers to problems. But a Microsoft product would theoretically integrate better with Windows desktop machines, and if the company can serve up an impressive offering, Linux could be in for a tussle. High-performance computing once required massive, expensive, exotic machines from companies like Cray, but the field is being remade by the arrival of clusters of low-end machines. While the trend could be considered an opportunity for Microsoft, which has long been the leading operating-system company, Linux has actually become the favored software used on the clusters.
5/25/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Loses Bid To Overturn Ruling	Microsoft yesterday lost a bid to overturn a judge's ruling on the validity of its Windows trademark before a trial begins in a lawsuit against Lindows Inc. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to hear Microsoft's claim that a judge incorrectly ruled the validity of the Windows trademark could be based on how the term was used 20 years ago. Microsoft sued Lindows, a San Diego-based maker of Linux software, in 2001, saying the name Lindows confuses customers. Lindows said it was counting on the federal trial to show that Microsoft's trademark was not valid and help it fight similar lawsuits in Europe. Last month Lindows renamed its products Linspire to avoid penalties in Europe.
5/21/2004	Oracle and Microsoft Cut a Software Deal	Two longtime rivals, Oracle and Microsoft, announced a partnership yesterday intended to help Oracle's databases work better with Microsoft's Windows operating system. The move, analysts say, is another step by Microsoft to improve its relations with other companies in the industry, even fierce competitors like Oracle. It is a pragmatic one for Oracle because many of its customers, up to 40 percent, run its database software on Windows.
5/21/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Ordered To Explain E-Mail Policy	A federal judge yesterday ordered Microsoft to search a company computer to help explain why Vice President James E. Allchin told employees in 2000 to eliminate e-mail messages. Judge J. Frederick Motz of United States District Court in Baltimore issued the order in an antitrust and patent suit by Burst.com Inc., which has accused Microsoft of stealing its technology for broadcasting sound and video over the Internet at high speeds. Burst.com charges that Microsoft destroyed e-mail that may help the smaller rival win its case. Judge Motz told the company to search a legal department computer for any evidence that Microsoft lawyers advised Mr. Allchin and others to adopt a policy of scrapping e-mail. A written policy circulated in 1997 by company computer operators advised employees not to save e-mail for more than 30 days ''due to legal issues.'' ''I want to know as much as I can how 'due to legal issues' got in there,'' Judge Motz told a Microsoft lawyer, John W. Treece, at a hearing.
5/20/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Benefit Cuts At Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation will cut vacation time for new employees and charge workers in the United States a $40 co-payment for brand-name prescription drugs as part of plans to cut costs as sales growth declines. Microsoft will also reduce the discount for employee stock purchases to 10 percent from 15 percent, starting in July, a spokeswoman, Tami Begasse, said. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., wants to reduce operating expenses by 21 percent next year. The company has forecast revenue growth of as little as 3.4 percent in the next fiscal year, compared with the 14 percent it expects for the year ending next month.
5/20/2004	Mac Office: Windows All Over	SHORTLY after Microsoft releases a new version of its Office software, its designers begin to discuss what to put into the next version. Driving these meetings, no doubt, is a painful question: ''How on earth will we come up with more features that we didn't think of last year, or the year before that -- especially when most people consider Office too bloated already?'' Last year, Office 2003 for Windows revealed the company's latest strategy: Add very, very little, and hope that people upgrade anyway.
5/19/2004	Google Moves Toward Clash With Microsoft	Edging closer to a direct confrontation with Microsoft, Google, the Web search engine, is preparing to introduce a powerful file and text software search tool for locating information stored on personal computers. Google's software, which is expected to be introduced soon, according to several people with knowledge of the company's plans, is the clearest indication to date that the company, based in Mountain View, Calif., hopes to extend its search business to compete directly with Microsoft's control of desktop computing.
5/12/2004	Sony Cuts PlayStation 2 Price To Compete With Nintendo	The Sony Corporation cut the price of its PlayStation 2 video game machine to $150 Tuesday to match the competition from Microsoft's Xbox as it moved ahead with its plans to challenge Nintendo as a maker of hand-held game players. The announcements came on the eve of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the annual computer and video game convention.
5/10/2004	I.B.M. Takes Aim at Microsoft With Server-Based Software for PC's and Hand-Held Devices	I.B.M. plans to announce today a software strategy for corporate desktop personal computers and hand-held devices -- one that is firmly anchored in the company's strength in data centers. The I.B.M. offerings include new Lotus Workplace software for PC's and hand-held devices, but most of the critical software resides on server computers in corporate data centers. Workers can tap into their e-mail messages, calendar, work group and other software using a Web browser. The approach harks back to a low-cost model of computing -- known as ''thin client'' computing -- promoted in the late 1990's by Sun Microsystems and Oracle as an alternative to Microsoft's hefty desktop programs.
5/4/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Red Hat Expected To Disclose Desktop Plans	Red Hat, the leading seller of open-source software, was expected to outline today a push into the global market for desktop systems, an area where the grass-roots Linux software has so far failed to make a dent against Microsoft. Red Hat is the largest repackager and seller of the open-source Linux system, which has a growing following among companies and government agencies that want an alternative to Microsoft's dominant Windows software. But Linux is mostly used for heavy-duty back-office computers and has been criticized as being too complicated for the average personal computer user. Red Hat's announcement, scheduled to be made in London, was expected to include details of a trial that Red Hat has been conducting with the German insurance company LVM. The German company is evaluating whether to install 8,400 Linux-based desktop systems, said Red Hat's chief executive, Matthew J. Szulik. He said Red Hat would also outline plans with Wind River Systems, a California developer of software and hardware, to help corporate customers of Linux systems to integrate wireless devices.

5/3/2004	Why Google Is Peering Out, At Microsoft	Next on Google's to-do list: Microsoft? Perhaps the most glaring omission from Google's remarkable ''owner's manual'' for its initial public offering, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, is that the company, operator of the leading search engine, gave prospective investors virtually no hint of where it was headed.
4/30/2004	Court Ruling In Europe Could Affect Microsoft	The European Court of Justice drew a legal line in the sand Thursday on the circumstances under which a dominant company must license its intellectual property for use by rivals. The ruling, involving two distributors of drugs, could have repercussions for the European Commission's antitrust case against Microsoft. The case involved one American drug distribution company, IMS Health, suing another, NDCHealth, for using its copyright-protected geographical breakdown of the German pharmaceutical market.
4/29/2004	Playing Catch-Up On the Console	IN an inconspicuous Texas office building, doom is being sealed pixel by pixel, polygon by polygon. More precisely, Doom 3, the long-awaited sequel in the enormously successful Doom video game series, is taking shape in the studios of Id Software. Early glimpses reveal a hellish vision that might have kept Hieronymous Bosch up nights: gut-sucking demons, skeletal spiders topped with inverted human skulls and other assorted grotesqueries skittering and scampering along dark hallways. And Id has not yet settled on a release date for Doom 3 (sometime this year, they say), one thing is clear: the game has been designed to be played on only one console, Microsoft's Xbox.
4/29/2004	Hurtling Onto Your Hard Drive, Short Films on Demand	Sit back, relax and enjoy. That's how AtomFilms Hi-Def, a new free online film service seeking to be so easy to use that instructions will be superfluous, introduces itself. Blending the services of AtomFilms, a Web-based film-on-demand pioneer, and Marven Networks, a broadband media software company, AtomFilms Hi-Def automatically downloads film to Windows-based computers with high-speed Internet access. Three films a week, 60 seconds to 30 minutes each, are saved onto the hard drives of computers running the AtomFilms-Marven software, which can be downloaded at www.hidef.atomfilms.com. The service says that all films can be viewed in full screen and, at the very least, DVD quality.
4/27/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Opens German Research Center	Microsoft opened a research center in Germany yesterday that will work on projects earmarked by the European Commission to further the region's technological competitiveness. The research group, called the European Microsoft Innovation Center, is in Aachen. Its staff of 12, which will be increased to 20 over the next several months, includes scientists and engineers from seven European countries. The decision to set up the European center was made several months ago, Microsoft said, and was championed by Microsoft's senior executive in Europe, Jean-Philippe Courtois. The center is being opened a month after the European Commission delivered a sweeping antitrust ruling against Microsoft that, if upheld, could force it to change its business practices. The commission also fined the company more than $600 million. Microsoft is appealing the ruling. Steve Lohr (NYT)
4/23/2004	All of European Antitrust Ruling Made Public	The European Commission released the full text of its antitrust ruling against Microsoft on Thursday, prompting a strong rebuttal from the company in a widely disseminated internal memorandum. Arguments made behind closed doors before the ruling was made last month are now being vented publicly as both sides seek support before Microsoft appeals to the European Court of Justice, probably in late May or June.
4/23/2004	Robust PC Sales Bolster Microsoft, But Profits Hurt by Legal Expenses	Microsoft reported solid quarterly gains in revenue and operating income yesterday, providing further evidence of increased demand for personal computers in both the consumer and corporate markets. The company's net income was held down by a series of one-time payments, including nearly $2 billion to settle its legal disputes with Sun Microsystems and $603 million for a fine imposed by the European Commission.
4/22/2004	Microsoft Agrees to Extend Time Limit in Licensing Deal	The Microsoft Corporation agreed Wednesday to extend a provision of its antitrust settlement with the Justice Department in response to concerns that the company was taking too long in putting the agreement into effect. The company, the world's largest computer software publisher, agreed to offer its competitors licenses for server software code for two years beyond the original expiration of the agreement in 2007.
4/22/2004	Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group	The SCO Group received a large dose of cash and a vote of confidence for its anti-Linux campaign last October when BayStar Capital arranged a $50 million investment in the company. BayStar, a private investment firm in Larkspur, Calif., put $20 million of its own money into SCO, which is based outside of Salt Lake City, and convinced the Royal Bank of Canada to chip in another $30 million. The fact that BayStar made its investment after a referral from Microsoft, a Linux antagonist, only added to the impression of coordinated support for SCO and its strategy.
4/22/2004	China Agrees To Postpone Wireless Plan	China agreed on Wednesday to give up a plan to impose its own standard for wireless technology, essentially agreeing to join the rest of the world rather than dividing it up. The Chinese said they would indefinitely postpone a plan, scheduled to go into effect on June 1, to impose a software encryption standard for wireless computers that American giants like Intel and Microsoft regarded as an unfair trade barrier.
4/20/2004	Preliminary Settlement Reached in Microsoft Case	Microsoft said yesterday that it had reached a preliminary settlement with consumers in Minnesota who claimed the company had overcharged them for software from 1994 to 2001, ending another legal entanglement, one of several that Microsoft has recently managed to resolve. Microsoft said the two parties were still working out the final terms of the agreement and would present them to the state court in July. The plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit were seeking as much as $500 million in damages, but the company could have been forced to pay far more than that under Minnesota law.
4/18/2004	Humans vs. Computers, Again. But There's Help for Our Side.	WE'VE seen this pattern before in the computer world: many companies scrambling at the same time to solve the same problem. Sometimes the concentration of effort mainly ends up underscoring how hard it can be to solve a given problem, like controlling spam or designing laptop batteries that last as long as they should. At other times, the problem everyone is tackling yields to steady year-by-year technological progress. Disk drives and other storage devices grow ever cheaper and more reliable. Transmission speeds over modems keep going up. But often such races result in true breakthroughs that make computers much more useful and creates countless opportunities for follow-on innovations and products. More than 20 years ago, the introduction of spreadsheets -- first VisiCalc, then Lotus 1-2-3 -- essentially created the personal computer industry by convincing businesses that PC's were tools, not gizmos. Over the last 10 years, Tim Berners-Lee, who is not getting rich, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who are, have made the modern Internet possible. Mr. Berners-Lee did so by creating the technical standard for Web pages and offering it as a public utility; Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, by creating Google, which is a public service but a private company.
4/15/2004	When Bob Vila Can't Come By, A Sage Steps Into the Breach	When it comes to home improvement, a good blueprint can make all the difference. Professionals can use high-end software like AutoCad to figure out how wide to make a staircase or how far to extend a patio. But a product from Broderbund, 3D Home Architect Design Suite Deluxe 6, puts many of the same resources within reach of do-it-yourselfers, allowing them to make plans with near-professional precision. The software, which is available for about $100 in stores and at www.broderbund.com, lets Windows users create in meticulous detail new walls, wings, gardens and gazebos. Project wizards guide users step by step through projects as if they were PowerPoint presentations.
4/15/2004	In a Sequel, File Making Made Easier	SOMEWHERE along the line, electronic databases started getting a bad name. Once word spread that our buying habits, Web explorations and video rentals were being tracked and recorded, the reputation of the computerized database somehow drifted from ''symbol of efficiency, accuracy, and a better tomorrow'' to ''Big Brother's best buddy.'' If databases were human, they'd hire an image consultant right about now. But if the only affairs you want to track are your own, a database is one of the most useful pieces of software. Many small-business owners, in particular, would be lost without some convenient way to track inventory, print invoices, maintain customer lists, tally billable hours, prepare expense reports and so on. And even at home, a true-blue database program is a much more flexible system for keeping track of CD collections, eBay auctions and even recipes than typing them all into Excel spreadsheets.
4/15/2004	RealNetworks Seeks Musical Alliance With Apple	RealNetworks made a direct appeal last week to Apple Computer, its Internet music rival, suggesting that the two companies form a common front against Microsoft in the digital music business. The offer to create a ''tactical alliance'' was made on April 9 by Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks, the Seattle-based Internet music and video service, in an e-mail message to Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chairman.
4/15/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Lindows Renames Its Software Overseas	Lindows, barred from using its name in three European countries after lawsuits by Microsoft, renamed its Linux software and Web site to avoid further litigation. Lindows renamed the software Linspire, the company said yesterday. It may still use the Lindows name in some instances in the United States. The decision by Lindows, which is based in San Diego, may have handed Microsoft a victory at a time when Microsoft is losing ground in a federal court battle with the company, said Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft. Microsoft had sued, claiming the Lindows.com name confused consumers and diluted the trademark for Windows, the operating system that runs about 95 percent of the world's personal computers. The federal judge in the case had questioned the validity of Windows as a trademark. Customers will not be affected and the change will not require an upgrade, Lindows said. The company's Web site will be renamed www.linspire.com. Lindows will be kept as the corporate name and used in ''certain instances'' in the United States, said a Lindows spokeswoman, Kira Lee.
4/14/2004	For Chip Rivals, Slugfest Worthy Of Video Game	Jen-Hsun Huang does not like to waste time. So when Mr. Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, was planning a new Silicon Valley headquarters for his company, the maker of chips that display high-quality images on computer screens, he insisted that his architect connect all four of the three-story buildings of the campus by second-floor skybridges to make sure that employees would not have to wait for elevators.
4/12/2004	Microsoft Settles InterTrust Suit For $440 Million	Microsoft plans to announce today that it has reached a $440 million legal settlement and licensing deal with the InterTrust Technologies Corporation, a private company and a pioneer in the development of software to protect digital music and movies from piracy. The settlement of InterTrust's patent infringement suit, filed in 2001, is the latest in Microsoft's continuing drive to resolve its legal disputes. It comes less than two weeks after the company, the world's largest software maker, agreed to pay Sun Microsystems $1.6 billion to settle Sun's private antitrust suit against Microsoft and to resolve patent claims.
4/8/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Lindows To Use Different Name Outside U.S.	Lindows, the embattled Linux seller, will adopt a separate name for operations outside the United States, its chief executive said this week. In a statement posted Tuesday on the Lindows Web site, the company's founder, Michael L. Robertson, said overseas lawsuits by Microsoft that challenge the company's name would force Lindows to adopt a new name for Europe and other foreign markets. He said it would reveal the new name next week.
4/5/2004	Helping People on the Move Keep Addresses Up to Date	After Jennifer Cahill changed jobs a few weeks ago, one of the first things she did was spend a few minutes ''Plaxo-ing'' her new contact information to 400 friends and business acquaintances. ''You just go down the list of people'' in your address book, said Ms. Cahill, who now works in the marketing group at Muirfield Capital in New York, ''and you click, click, click who you want to send it to.''
4/4/2004	Silicon Valley Seeks Peace in Long War Against Microsoft	It was not that long ago that Scott McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems, referred to his bitter rival, Bill Gates, as Darth Vader and Mr. Gates's company, Microsoft, as the Evil Empire. It appears that the computer industry is finally coming to terms with Microsoft. On Friday, a settlement was reached in the acrimonious, seemingly intractable feud that had long defined the sometimes adolescent relationship between the entrepreneurial culture of Silicon Valley and Microsoft, the powerful company from Redmond, Wash., that dominates the software business.
4/3/2004	An Oral History, Most of It Acidic	Here are a few ways that Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, has described Microsoft and its products over the years: ''Hairball'' -- a description of Windows and Office, Microsoft desktop products.
4/3/2004	Microsoft and Sun End Long Acrimony In Surprise Accord	Microsoft and Sun Microsystems announced a surprising armistice yesterday, ending years of public acrimony between Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive and the leader of the anti-Microsoft camp in Silicon Valley, and the world's largest software company. Under the agreement, Microsoft will pay Sun, its longtime rival, a total of $1.6 billion to settle Sun's private antitrust suit against Microsoft and to resolve patent claims. The pact also includes a 10-year commitment by the two companies to work closely together, share technology and license each other's intellectual property.
4/1/2004	Google Sends A Message To Competitors	Google, the dominant Internet search company, is planning to raise the stakes in its intensifying competition with Yahoo and Microsoft by unveiling a new consumer-oriented e-mail service. The new service, to be named Gmail, is scheduled to be released on Thursday, according to people involved with the plan. It will be ''soft launched,'' they said, in a manner that Google has followed with other features that it has added to its Web site, with little fanfare and presented initially as a long-running test.
3/25/2004	A Slayer of Monopolies, One Corporation at a Time	When Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, arrived in Brussels early last week to negotiate with the European Commission over its antitrust case, lawyers involved in the talks said they believed that a settlement was within reach. But Mario Monti, the commission's chief antitrust enforcer, insisted on provisions that would constrain Microsoft from future behavior like the current practice of bundling its Media Player into Windows.
3/25/2004	A Choice of Kill or Be Killed, With Futuristic Firepower	With the latest versions of Doom and Half-Life still months away from store shelves, fans of the combat video games known as first-person shooters found relief for itchy trigger fingers when Unreal Tournament 2004 was released last week. Its publisher, Atari, declined to release sales figures, but retailers have reported selling more than 100,000 copies since the game was issued on March 16. A spokesman for the retailer GameStop said that it was already its best-selling PC game of the year. The suggested price is $39.99, and don't bother trying to play it on an antiquated PC. The Windows version requires at least a one-gigahertz processor, and 1.5 gigahertz is recommended.
3/25/2004	Paring Away At Microsoft	The European Commission issued an antitrust ruling against Microsoft yesterday that is intended to force the company to change its fundamental business strategy of bundling new products into its Windows operating system, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers. The ruling imposed a $603 million fine. It also required Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without its Media Player and divulge technical information to competitors so that they can create software for business servers that would work well with Windows. [Page C1.]
3/25/2004	Excerpts From Ruling in Europe and Microsoft's Response	Following are excerpts from the European Union's statement yesterday on its finding that Microsoft broke European Union competition law, and comments from Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Brad Smith, its general counsel, in a conference call later in the day: In order to restore the conditions of fair competition, the commission has imposed the following remedies:
3/25/2004	Europeans Rule Against Microsoft; Appeal Is Promised	European regulators ruled on Wednesday that Microsoft broke European Union law by using its ''near monopoly'' in the Windows operating system to squeeze out rivals in other kinds of software. The penalty, which came after five years of investigation, consultations and negotiations, went well beyond what the United States Justice Department ultimately agreed to in its antitrust case brought in the late 1990's.
3/25/2004	Big Changes Are Planned In Game-Software Strategy	Microsoft announced a new software development strategy Wednesday that aims to blur the distinction between its PC game and Xbox video game console businesses. Under the strategy, which the company calls XNA, a developer of game software would be able to write a single program that could be translated for use on Windows PC's, on Xbox video game consoles or on mobile hardware systems.
3/24/2004	Market Place; Microsoft as a high-tech variant of an old-style utility? It could happen.	PROVING that Microsoft has a monopoly is not hard, and now regulators on two continents have agreed that it abuses that monopoly. But figuring out what to do about it is proving to be a daunting task for Europe, as it was for the United States after Microsoft lost its antitrust trial there. In the end, the risk to Microsoft may not be that it will be forced to pay fines as large as the 497 million euros, or $613 million, being sought by the European Commission, or even to distribute a competitor's program, as it was reported to have agreed to do in ultimately unsuccessful settlement talks with the commission. Instead, the risk is that Microsoft is becoming the functional equivalent of an old-style utility, with extensive government regulation that could even extend into determining what products it sells and at what prices.
3/24/2004	Newly Released Documents Shed Light on the Tactics Used by Microsoft	Even as Microsoft prepares to face penalties from the European Union, which accuses the company of abusing the Windows monopoly, new details about the tactics Microsoft used to secure a dominant position in software markets for nearly two decades are emerging in a state courthouse in Minneapolis. Testimony during the second week of trial in the consumer class-action lawsuit in Minnesota has revealed some embarrassing internal documents from Microsoft which were not disclosed in the bitter 1997 federal antitrust lawsuit that focused on the company's attempt to control the browser markets in the 1990's.
3/23/2004	Antitrust Fine For Microsoft Is Said to Be $613 Million	Antitrust regulators will fine Microsoft 497 million euros ($613 million) on Wednesday, when the European Commission formally rules that the company abused its monopoly in computer operating systems, people close to the company said on Monday. The fine, which was set late last week after settlement talks with Microsoft broke down, was endorsed by regulators from the 15 member nations of the European Union on Monday.
3/22/2004	Game Wars 2: Battle for the Living Room; Giants Look to Create the Next Digital Hub	The consumer electronics and personal computing industries are supposedly rushing toward a grand digital convergence. Maybe it is actually a divergence.
3/22/2004	One Case Wraps Up for Microsoft, But Problems in Europe Still Exist	While the European Commission this week goes through the final steps to conclude its five-year case against the Microsoft Corporation, the company's legal problems in Europe are far from over and appear to be accelerating, antitrust lawyers and officials said. Attention will now focus on two other antitrust issues involving the company. One involves a wide-ranging complaint about the dominance of Windows, Microsoft's operating system. Separately, the commission is conducting an investigation into certain clauses in the company's licensing contracts with computer makers.
3/21/2004	Musical Chairs With the Big Boys	IS RealNetworks the next Netscape? Rob Glaser, the founder and chief executive of RealNetworks, a pioneering maker of music-playing software for the Internet, bridles at the notion. ''Our situation is very different in some important ways,'' he said in a lengthy interview last week.
3/20/2004	Europe Takes On Windows	Microsoft is widely expected to suffer a major defeat next week in Europe, the latest front in the antitrust wars. The European Commission will follow the lead of American regulators and courts in declaring that Microsoft illegally abused its monopolistic market share in computer operating systems to harm competitors. But the commission is overreaching in seeking remedies that could hurt not only Microsoft, but consumers as well. One issue in the dispute is how much proprietary software code Microsoft must share with competitors. The second, more contentious issue is whether Microsoft should be allowed to include its Media Player in Windows, to the detriment of competing software -- like RealNetworks' Real Player -- that enables computers to play music and videos.
3/20/2004	NEBRASKA COURT REVIVES SUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT	The Nebraska Supreme Court revived a class-action lawsuit yesterday contending Microsoft overcharged consumers in the state for its Windows 98 operating software. The lawsuit is similar to dozens filed against Microsoft after a federal appeals court in 2001 said the company had illegally exploited its Windows monopoly. Microsoft has settled consumer suits in 10 states for $1.55 billion and is on trial in Minnesota in a $425 million class-action damage case. The Nebraska Supreme Court reversed its own June 25, 2003, decision, which had upheld a lower court's dismissal of the case. A state court judge in Fremont had held that under Nebraska law only consumers who had purchased Windows 98 directly from Microsoft could seek monetary damages.
3/19/2004	Microsoft Faces Antitrust Loss In Europe Case	European regulators announced on Thursday that settlement talks with Microsoft had collapsed, leaving it virtually certain that an antitrust ruling would be issued against the company that could limit its ability to add new features to its software in one of the largest and richest markets in the world. The end of the talks came after three days of face-to-face meetings between Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, and the European Union's antitrust chief, Mario Monti. A formal ruling is not expected until Wednesday, but Mr. Monti unexpectedly appeared at the European Commission's noon briefing to announce that ''a settlement on the Microsoft case has not been possible.''
3/18/2004	Chances of Microsoft Accord in Europe Dim	The chances of a settlement between Microsoft and European antitrust regulars have dimmed significantly, as Mario Monti, Europe's antitrust chief, is now demanding further concessions from Microsoft as the price for a settlement, people close to the talks said Wednesday. Mr. Monti held a brief meeting with Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive on Wednesday morning, after spending four hours with him and Microsoft's chief lawyer, Bradford L. Smith, on Tuesday, a person close to the talks said, adding that they parted without reaching any agreement.
3/17/2004	Microsoft Nears End of Settlement Talks	In an effort to reach a settlement with European regulators, Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, met with Europe's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, on Tuesday, just over a week before regulators are expected to find that Microsoft abused its dominance in operating software. Talks broke off early evening Tuesday and are expected to resume either face-to-face or by phone on Wednesday morning, according to people close to the talks.
3/16/2004	European Regulators Back Proposed Microsoft Ruling	European antitrust regulators are united behind Mario Monti, their top antitrust official, on his proposed finding that Microsoft has abused its dominant position in the software market, the European Commission said Monday. Barring an 11th-hour settlement, the commission, the year-round administrative arm of the European Union, will rule as soon as March 24 that Microsoft is an abusive monopolist and will order the company to change the way it sells its software in its 15 member nations.
3/15/2004	European Regulators Meet Today on Proposal to Brand Microsoft a Monopolist	On Monday, top antitrust regulators from the 15 nations in the European Union will gather here in the Centre Borschette, a bunkerlike building a stone's throw from the headquarters of the European Commission, to discuss a draft ruling that finds Microsoft guilty of abusing its dominance in operating software. With this meeting, the clock on the five-year-old antitrust case against Microsoft begins to run down. In less than two weeks, barring a last-minute settlement, the European Commission is expected to declare Microsoft an abusive monopolist, impose a fine of $100 million to $1 billion and order the company to make fundamental changes to the way it sells software in Europe.
3/15/2004	Microsoft Effort to Share Code Reaches Milestone of a Million Participants	Three years ago, Microsoft announced an initiative for letting industry partners, corporate customers and researchers peek at and sometimes tweak the code in the company's software. The motivation for the program, which Microsoft called shared source, could be summed up in one word -- Linux. Linux, of course, is an operating system developed and improved by a community of programmers who freely share code, which is the open-source approach to building software. The rising popularity of Linux, a rival to Microsoft's Windows, forced Microsoft to open up a bit.
3/13/2004	MICROSOFT IS SAID TO FILE SUIT AGAINST LINDOWS	Lindows, barred from using its name in three European countries after lawsuits brought by Microsoft, said yesterday that Microsoft has asked a Dutch court to fine the company 100,000 euros ($122,000) a day. Lindows said that Microsoft was asking for the fine for permitting the Lindows Web site to be reached by people in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Microsoft has said the Lindows name harms the value of its Windows trademark. Courts in Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands have barred Lindows.com from using the word, and Microsoft is also suing in Seattle. Lindows, based in San Diego, finds it impossible to comply with Microsoft's demand since visitors to its Web site come from international Internet service providers and other methods, Lindows chief executive, Michael Robertson, said. The Lindows software lets Windows programs run on computers that run the rival Linux operating system, and the company said in November that it expected to have 30,000 systems with its programs in Canada within a year.
3/12/2004	Microsoft Said to Encourage Big Investment in SCO Group	More evidence emerged yesterday about Microsoft's role in encouraging the anti-Linux campaign being waged by the SCO Group, a small Utah company. BayStar Capital, a private investment firm, said Microsoft suggested that it invest in SCO, which is engaged in a legal campaign against Linux, a rival to Microsoft's Windows.
3/11/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Programming Tools To Be Delayed	Microsoft said yesterday that its new SQL database server software and Visual Studio tools for building programs would be delayed until the first half of 2005 to ensure they work right. Microsoft wants to be certain that the software, to be named SQL Server 2005, is a ''quality release,'' and will delay it to issue a third test version in the second half of the year, said Tom Rizzo, product management director for SQL. Product delays are hampering Microsoft's efforts to win more sales of two-year licenses that entitle users to updates, analysts have said. Mr. Rizzo said the delay would not hurt Microsoft's database software sales because SQL Server 2000, released in September 2000, is still selling well.
3/11/2004	4 Big Internet Providers File Suits To Stop Leading Senders of Spam	Four major Internet providers announced yesterday that they had filed lawsuits meant to shut a number of leading senders of unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam. The suits, which are seeking monetary damages and injunctions against further mass e-mail messages, are among the first to invoke the new federal antispam law, which went into effect Jan. 1.
3/11/2004	New Domain Is Proposed	In a sign that the wireless Internet is coming of age, Nokia, Vodafone, Microsoft and six other technology and telecommunications companies joined Wednesday to propose the equivalent of a .mobile Internet address category for mobile Web access. The nine companies, which also include Hewlett-Packard, the Orange unit of France Télécom and Samsung Electronics, announced their application for a mobile-specific domain in London. The actual name for the address suffix has yet to be determined, but would indicate a wireless theme, like .mobile or .phone, the group said.
3/4/2004	Down-to-Earth Directions For the Well-Shod Tourist	Travelers can download directions from online services like Mapquest onto a palmtop computer. But those directions are intended for motorists. If you are on foot, such maps can lead you on strolls along highways or unnecessary detours to take account of one-way streets. Fodor's has made things easier by bundling map software designed with pedestrians in mind into electronic versions of nine of its travel guides. Brent Peich, general manager of Fodors.com, said the nine cities include New York, Washington, San Francisco and Paris -- all destinations where travelers ''are generally in the city center and they're walking, not driving.''
3/2/2004	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Microsoft And eBay Plan Venture	Microsoft announced a partnership with eBay yesterday that will allow Office applications to tie into the online auction service. The software giant plans to offer free sample code through the eBay Developers Program and later Microsoft's MSDN developer site for tying selected Office applications to the auctioneer's listing servers. The eBay Developers Program allows developers to create programs that help large-scale sellers on the site manage inventory, automate listings and do other tasks.
3/1/2004	Microsoft, Amid Dwindling Interest, Talks Up Computing as a Career	Bill Gates went on a campaign tour last week, trying to reinvigorate his base, as they say in politics. The number of students majoring in computer science is falling, even at the elite universities. So Mr. Gates went stumping at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, M.I.T. and Harvard, telling students that they could still make a good living in America, even as the nation's industry is sending some jobs, like software programming, abroad.
2/27/2004	Regulators Conduct Search of Microsoft's Office in Tokyo	The Fair Trade Commission of Japan raided the Tokyo headquarters of Microsoft on Thursday, seeking information on how the company supplies software for personal computers sold in the country. ''Eight people from the F.T.C. came here at 9:30 a.m. to investigate our contract related to patents on our software with PC makers,'' said Masashi Shinbo, a Microsoft spokesman in Tokyo. ''Our contract is legal.''
2/25/2004	Europe May Tell Microsoft to Split Software	European antitrust regulators are considering a requirement that Microsoft sell two versions of Windows in Europe -- one with the music- and video-playing software stripped out -- should they find the company to be an abusive monopoly, people close to the case said Tuesday. Regulators may also demand that Microsoft itself propose ''within a few months of a ruling'' what computer code for Windows it should disclose to make the operating system fully compatible with programs and servers manufactured by rivals, these people said. Servers drive networks of personal computers.
2/25/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Gates Demonstrates Security Measures	Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, yesterday demonstrated security features planned for the Windows XP operating system. He said Microsoft had decided to turn on, by default, firewall protection for Windows-based computers connected to the Internet, to make it harder to exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system. The features, to be introduced sometime in the next four months, also include additions to Internet Explorer and a centralized Windows Security Center panel. John Markoff (NYT)
2/23/2004	Microsoft Creates a Stir In Its Work With the U.N.	The chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, Bill Gates, won widespread applause in January when he trumpeted an agreement to give $1 billion in software and cash to the United Nations as part of a job-training program for the developing world. But Microsoft did not seek any attention for a much smaller amount that it contributed earlier to pay some travel expenses for a United Nations business standards group.
2/19/2004	Presto! A Rough Sketch Snaps Elegantly Into Place	Graphic design and deadlines often seem to go hand in hand, so most designers welcome software that helps them do their work faster. CorelDraw 12, part of the new CorelDraw Graphics Suite 12 software package, recognizes rough shapes and drawings sketched onscreen with a mouse or a graphics pen, instantly turns them into smooth curves and lines, and properly positions them in a document. Along with the CorelDraw program for page layout, illustration and drawing, Graphics Suite 12 includes Corel Photo-Paint for editing digital images and Corel RAVE for creating motion graphics in Macromedia's Flash format. The suite has an Export for Office feature that makes the Corel files compatible with documents created in the Microsoft Office or WordPerfect Office suites. Images and graphics can also be easily saved and imported into architectural and layout programs.
2/19/2004	1,000 Gigabytes Appease The Multimedia Glutton	If hefty digital video files, thousands of MP3 songs and scads of JPEG images are crowding your computer's 30- or 40-gigabyte hard drive, you may want to ease the space crunch by supersizing your system with an external hard drive. There are plenty of big drives that can add a few hundred gigabytes of extra space. And then there is the LaCie Bigger Disk hard drive, which holds a full terabyte -- that's right, 1,000 gigabytes -- of data.
2/18/2004	Europeans Reject Offer By Microsoft	European antitrust regulators have rebuffed an offer by the Microsoft Corporation to include audio- and video-playing software of its competitors in the form of CD-ROM's in the boxes of new personal computers, people close to the talks said yesterday. While it is unclear when the offer was made, the proposal indicates that Microsoft is actively pursuing a resolution of the long-running antitrust case. But time may be running short.
2/17/2004	Microsoft and I.B.M. put their marketing dollars into trying to keep their existing customers happy.	TWO technology giants, I.B.M. and Microsoft, are reassigning accounts with spending estimated at more than $500 million in decisions that underline the increasing importance of marketing communications outside the realm of traditional advertising. The accounts being awarded by I.B.M. and Microsoft to agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies and the WPP Group cover assignments unrelated to producing television commercials, print advertisements or billboards. Rather, the work is primarily centered on what is known as customer relationship management -- that is, efforts to strengthen the loyalties of current customers that can range from offers of free merchandise to rewards for frequent buyers to invitations for sponsored events.
2/14/2004	Release of Windows Coding Is a New Worry for Microsoft	The illicit distribution on Thursday of portions of the secret programmer's instructions for two versions of the Windows operating system poses vexing legal and security challenges for Microsoft. Computer security experts said Friday that having even relatively small parts of the blueprints for Microsoft's Windows 2000 and Windows NT operating system as easily available reference material for potential vandals and troublemakers could complicate the company's already difficult task in securing its software.
2/13/2004	Microsoft Weighs Options And Keeps Its Cards Close	Microsoft has three options in the Comcast-Disney takeover fight: play the savior, the banker or stay on the sidelines. Microsoft, which holds 7.4 percent of Comcast and has helped the company in deals in the past, is saying nothing about Comcast's unsolicited $54 billion bid for Disney, or any role that it might play in a corporate drama that could run for some time. And Wall Street investment bankers say they have not yet detected any signs of the Microsoft deal machine rumbling into motion.
2/11/2004	Microsoft Urges Users to Install a Patch to a Software Flaw	Microsoft announced yesterday that people who use its operating system software must patch their computers yet again, or their PC's will be vulnerable to attacks that could cede control to hackers. The company called the software flaw a ''critical'' vulnerability, its highest rating. It is the second major security flaw announced this month by Microsoft, which recently began issuing regularly scheduled security patches for its software. ''We urge all of our customers to apply this update,'' said Stephen Toulouse, a security program manager with Microsoft's security response center.
2/8/2004	Editors' Note	An article last Sunday described the coming battle between Google and Microsoft over the Internet search business. It quoted Nancy Blachman, a computer scientist, as saying that Google had an advantage in the race because it had the most current users. The article also identified Ms. Blachman as the author of an independent guide to using Google but should have noted that Ms. Blachman, though not affiliated with that company, is married to a Google software engineer.
2/8/2004	Editorial Observer; The Hard Way to Learn That the Internet Is Not Disneyland	The Internet is a sprawling system of wires, cables and computers that runs through boardrooms, basements and back alleys all over the globe. Policing such a system would be hard enough in any event. Tracking crimes is all the more difficult because the Internet allows malefactors to mask their identities, even as they spy, steal or commit spectacular acts of cybersabotage. Sophisticated users have known of this problem all along and have taken elaborate precautions to protect themselves. Now casual users are being initiated through epidemics like the one caused by the MyDoom e-mail worm, which recently infected up to a million computers worldwide. This insidious program avoided sophisticated users whose security systems might have killed it off early and instead took aim at inexperienced users, partly through a series of names written into its code. The infected machines spewed out hundreds of millions of worm-laden e-mail messages, which generated millions of return messages, telling the infected parties what they already knew: that their computers had been invaded by the fastest-propagating e-mail worm ever seen.
2/5/2004	An All-Out Race To Expand Your DVD Archive	Just as CD burners got faster at recording discs as the technology improved, DVD recorders are beginning to pick up speed. The Memorex True 8X Dual Format DVD Recorder can record DVD+R and DVD-R discs at a sizzling (for DVD) 8x pace. With the ability to store 4.7 gigabytes of data on a disc, DVD has become a common option for data backup as well as recording homemade video. The True 8X drive also records other disc formats at various high speeds: DVD+RW and DVD-RW discs at a speed of 4x, CD-RW discs at 24x and CD-R discs at 40x. The drive reads DVD-ROM at a speed of 12x and CD-ROM discs at 40x and comes with a kit for either vertical or horizontal installation inside the PC. To prevent recording errors and wasted discs, the True 8X uses a two-megabyte buffer to keep the data flowing onto the DVD during the burning process.
2/2/2004	Patents; As shown by recent cases argued in the courts, properly crediting an inventor can be murky business.	LANDMARK decisions in two of the biggest continuing battles in the world of invention were made in January. Eolas v. Microsoft and Symbol Technologies v. Lemelson both evoke David versus Goliath, but only one ends like the biblical tale -- at least for the moment. In one case, the giant is dealt a mighty blow; in the other, David dies a death of a thousand cuts. Both cases underscore a truth often obscured by a national mythology that celebrates the likes of Edison and Bell as lone, brilliant inventors: assigning proper credit for the invention of any given technology can be a murky enterprise.
2/2/2004	Speech by GatesLends Visibility To E-Mail Stamp In War on Spam	Should people have to buy electronic stamps to send e-mail? Some Internet experts have long suggested that the rising tide of junk e-mail, or spam, would turn into a trickle if senders had to pay even as little as a penny for each message they sent. Such an amount might be minor for legitimate commerce and communications, but it could destroy businesses that send a million offers in hopes that 10 people will respond. The idea has been dismissed both as impractical and against the free spirit of the Internet.
2/1/2004	The Coming Search Wars	AT the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Microsoft, the software heavyweight, and Google, the scrappy Internet search company, eyed each other like wary prizefighters entering the ring. Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, stated his admiration for the ''high level of I.Q.'' of Google's designers. ''We took an approach that I now realize was wrong,'' he said of his company's earlier decision to ignore the search market. But, he added pointedly, ''we will catch them.''
1/30/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Won't Make Changes For Patent	Microsoft said yesterday that it would not, ''for now,'' make changes in its software as a result of a court ruling in which a jury told it to pay $521 million for infringing patents related to Internet Explorer. Microsoft had said in October that it was considering modest changes that would let Web developers who use Internet Explorer technology avoid any concern of infringing a University of California patent licensed to Eolas Technologies. A federal jury in Chicago said Microsoft impermissibly used technology for methods for navigating the Internet. Microsoft is appealing the verdict and the Patent and Trademark Office is reviewing whether the patent should have been issued. Microsoft's Internet Explorer has 96 percent of the worldwide market for Web browser software. ''The steps were modest that we were proposing, and the feedback that we were getting from the industry was, rather than change something, just hold off'' until the appeal and patent office review are resolved, a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Desler, said. An Eolas lawyer, Martin Lueck, said the announcement illustrated how important the technology was to the browser.
1/29/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: New Version Of Virus Appears	A new version of the MyDoom virus has appeared, and it tries just as hard as the first one to live up to its name. MyDoom is the fastest-spreading computer virus to date, with some 300,000 infected computers and 160,000 virus-bearing e-mail messages zinging across the Internet every hour, said Craig Schmugar, a virus researcher for Network Associates. He and other virus experts said it will program infected computers to start an online attack on Sunday against SCO Group, which sells the Unix operating system. The new version will begin a similar attack against Microsoft, and blocks access to antivirus online sites that could help users protect against the malicious software, as well as some online advertising sites. The goal of the programmer behind the worms, said Mr. Schmugar, appears to be creating a large population of machines that can be controlled remotely for such purposes as sending spam and diverting online advertising traffic. The new version contains a comment within its lines of code, ''andy: I'm just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry.'' John Schwartz (NYT)
1/29/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Warning On Microsoft Antitrust Case	Time is running out for a settlement between the European Commission and Microsoft in the long-running antitrust case, said Mario Monti, left, the European commissioner for competition. ''We are not against a settlement, if that is clearly in consumers' interests, but the time is running out,'' he said yesterday. A draft ruling that brands Microsoft an abusive monopolist is being circulated internally within the commission, before it is shown to national competition regulators for comments next month. A final decision is expected in March or April. Paul Meller (NYT)
1/27/2004	Antitrust Ruling Near For Microsoft In Europe	Antitrust officials at the European Commission have drafted a final ruling in their six-year case against Microsoft, people close to the commission said on Monday. ''We are concluding the case,'' Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the competition panel, said.
1/26/2004	Deep Price Cuts Help Nintendo Climb to No. 2 in Game Sales	Nintendo has evidently decided to stop playing around. Bolstered by strong holiday sales, the company, once synonymous with video games, was able to squeeze back into second place last year in the United States market for game consoles, according to industry data to be released today.
1/26/2004	Gates Predicts That Spam Will Go Away	The problem of spam e-mail messages will be gone within two years, Bill Gates promised Friday. Speaking at a late-night session of the World Economic Forum, Mr. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, said the company was working on three ways to enable e-mail users to keep spam out of their computers.
1/24/2004	Judge Satisfied With Microsoft's Antitrust Case Compliance	A federal judge said yesterday that she was generally satisfied with Microsoft's efforts to comply with the settlement terms in the government's antitrust case, after the company announced steps to make it easier for outside companies to license its technology. The judge's comments come a week after the Justice Department, in a joint court filing with 16 states and the District of Columbia, said the November 2002 consent decree had ''fallen short'' of its goal of nurturing competition in the software industry.
1/23/2004	Microsoft's Revenue for Quarter Gains as Profit Declines	Buoyed by the unexpected double-digit growth in PC sales and an increase in business-customer revenue, the Microsoft Corporation reported on Thursday that its fiscal second-quarter results substantially surpassed financial analysts' expectations as revenue exceeded $10 billion for the first time. While sales were unusually strong, Microsoft's profit declined in the quarter because of a significant charge for stock-based compensation for employees. Moreover, the company faced tough questioning from analysts who have become increasingly uneasy about the way the company sells its software to corporate customers and the long-term effects of that strategy.
1/22/2004	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about two court reports critical of compliance with the antitrust consent decree between Microsoft and the government misstated a provision of the decree. It ordered Microsoft to license the Windows computer code that controls the transfer of data, making it possible for competitors to connect to the company's server products -- not to license the Windows operating system.
1/22/2004	The Electronic Verification Is in the Mail	ENSURING the integrity of a Microsoft Word document can be tricky. Hackers and pranksters have made a hobby of exposing security flaws in the software, often altering what appear to be protected files. But a new service shores up security with an adage that is at once novel and old-fashioned: let the post office handle it. The Postal Service, Microsoft and a technology company called Authentidate have developed a system called Electronic Postmark for verifying that a document's content is the same as when a user saved it. The service, introduced in October, is in some ways more a notary public's stamp than a postmark, intended particularly for those affixing their electronic signatures to documents relayed online.
1/19/2004	As Consumers Revolt, a Rush to Block Pop-Up Online Ads	The boom in Internet pop-up advertisement may be about to, well, pop. The big ads that flash in separate windows above or below Web pages are among the most intrusive, and to many people, the most obnoxious features on the Internet. Not coincidentally, the pop-up format is also among the most effective for advertisers and the most profitable for Web site publishers.
1/19/2004	Car Talk Site Switching Software Allegiance	In the battle over audio player software, Microsoft has scored a victory. The Web site for the radio program Car Talk is switching the software that online listeners use, from a version made by RealNetworks to one by Microsoft, according to Time Kill Weekly, the site's e-mail newsletter. Car Talk, broadcast by National Public Radio, features Tom and Ray Magliozzi, brothers who opine about automobiles and have a loyal following.
1/17/2004	Plaintiffs Say Microsoft Still Behaves Badly	Two reports filed with a federal court Friday suggest that the November 2002 antitrust consent decree between Microsoft and the Justice Department has neither fostered significant competition nor changed Microsoft's anticompetitive behavior. The government's agreement with Microsoft to settle its antitrust lawsuit has ''fallen short'' of its goal of creating competition, according to the court- ordered report issued Friday.
1/16/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Change Windows Music Link	Microsoft has agreed to a government demand that it eliminate a feature of its Windows XP operating system that overrides competitors' Web browsers, the Justice Department said yesterday. Microsoft will change the ''shop for music online'' function of its personal computer operating system so that competitors' browsers will not be overridden by Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the Justice Department said. Microsoft shares fell 16 cents, to $27.54.
1/15/2004	Gaming With an Opponent Who's 'Over There'	LAST month Kevin Dustin Sr. spent a Monday afternoon playing video games with his son, Kevin Jr. While this might be an everyday event for many families, his session was conducted long distance, and was aimed at improving military morale. Mr. Dustin Sr. was at a Microsoft Xbox set up at the U.S.O. center near Times Square, and his son, a 25-year-old Air Force staff sergeant, was 4,000 miles away at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. The 90 minutes they spent playing Project Gotham Racing 2 was part of a collaboration between an Air Force command, Microsoft and the U.S.O. that enables military personnel overseas to play video games and speak with their families and friends using an online gaming connection called Xbox Live.
1/15/2004	On the Road With an iPod, a Way to Beat the Battery Blues	Although the iPod was originally marketed as a way to listen to digital music on the go, enthusiasts soon adapted the players for use with home and car stereos. For iPodlings who really like to drive, Digital Lifestyle Outfitters has released the latest version of the TransPod FM, a combination digital FM transmitter and iPod-battery charger designed to work with the slim redesigned iPods that appeared last spring. The TransPod FM plugs into the 12-volt power outlet on the dashboard to provide juice for the iPod while holding the player upright in a matching white cradle. To play the iPod's music through the car stereo, you just find an unoccupied FM frequency and use buttons on the TransPod to tune its FM transmitter to the same frequency. The TransPod can work anywhere on the FM spectrum, which is helpful in urban areas where the dial is already jammed with radio stations.
1/9/2004	Hewlett Joins With Apple In Music Deal	Hewlett-Packard said Thursday that it would begin selling a version of Apple Computer's iPod digital music player and bundling Apple's iTunes online music store with its personal computers in a new partnership that points to a major realignment of forces within the computer industry. The agreement -- which was completed only after an extensive bargaining session that ran long into Wednesday night between Carleton S. Fiorina, Hewlett's chief executive, and Apple's Steven P. Jobs -- represents a significant departure for both companies. For the first time, Mr. Jobs has stepped away from the self-enclosed Apple-only strategy he has pursued since he returned to run the company in 1997. Meanwhile, Hewlett, the second-largest computer maker in the world, has put its software partner, Microsoft, on notice that it will not necessarily follow its lead in every case.
1/8/2004	Microsoft's Latest, Strapped to a Wrist	FOR a company whose name begins with the word micro, practically nothing about Microsoft is small. It has huge profits, enormous power and vast ambition. It might come as a surprise, therefore, to discover that the company's latest target for conquest is minuscule indeed: the face of your wristwatch.
1/8/2004	Retreating From Dial-Up Business, Microsoft Aims MSN.com at Yahoo	Microsoft said yesterday that it was repositioning its money-losing MSN Internet service operation to compete more directly with Yahoo's personalized Web portal and America Online's broadband premium service. At the same time, it is planning a new MSN premium service, priced at $9.95 monthly and modeled after Apple Computer's .Mac Internet-based customer support service.
1/5/2004	Five Giants In Technology Unite to Deter File Sharing	The technology and entertainment industries have long been at odds over the best way to secure intellectual property rights as digital technology advances. Now, five of what industry executives say are the world's most powerful computer, cellphone and electronics companies are planning a new system for protecting digital music, video and software from illicit file sharing that they hope will at least narrow that gap.
12/26/2003	Microsoft to Pay $60 Million Settlement	Microsoft has agreed to pay $60 million to the Imagexpo unit of the SPX Corporation to end a legal fight over a patent for real-time conferencing software. A jury in Richmond, Va., in November told Microsoft to pay Imagexpo $62.3 million for impermissibly using the company's patented technology in the NetMeeting Whiteboard features in Microsoft programs. That amount could have been tripled, because the jury determined that Microsoft's use of the Imagexpo's invention was intentional.
12/25/2003	Yes, Virginia, Powerpoint Has a Rival	Speakers hoping to dazzle an audience with a professional-looking presentation have long relied on PowerPoint by Microsoft. Now the makers of a new alternative program, Live Presentations, are trying to carve out their own territory with a smaller price tag. The software, from Data Becker, offers tools similar to those in PowerPoint to create lecture materials, sales presentations, business proposals and Internet-based presentations.
12/19/2003	Spitzer Files Suit Against 3 Over Spam	The attorney general of New York, Eliot Spitzer, filed a civil lawsuit yesterday against three marketing companies, accusing them of sending fraudulent e-mail messages, and said that he would seek penalties so large that they would drive each company out of business. At a news conference in New York, Mr. Spitzer singled out Scott Richter, the president of OptInRealBig, a Westminster, Colo., concern that he said was the third-most-prolific sender of junk e-mail, or spam.
12/19/2003	RealNetworks Accuses Microsoft Of Restricting Competition	RealNetworks filed a $1 billion antitrust lawsuit on Thursday accusing Microsoft of using its monopoly power to restrict competition and limit consumer choice in digital media markets. Legal experts said that the lawsuit, which cites new evidence suggesting that Microsoft's business practices have remained unchanged after its landmark court battle with the federal government, indicated that its legal woes were not necessarily over despite the company's accommodation with the Bush administration and its settlement of several other lawsuits.
12/18/2003	New York and Microsoft Expected To File Civil Suits in Spam Case	Eliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney general, and Microsoft plan to file civil suits today charging one of the nation's most prominent e-mail marketers with fraud stemming from sending unsolicited commercial e-mail, commonly known as spam, according to several people involved in the cases. The suits are expected to name three companies, including OptInRealBig, which is run by Scott Richter, who has been widely identified as a major source of bulk e-mail and has been an outspoken defender of his marketing practices. Mr. Richter said Wednesday that he had been notified by the state attorney general's office and by Microsoft that charges were imminent. He said that the accusations were baseless.
12/18/2003	Data and Bookmarks Dangle From Your Key Chain	With their large storage capacity and small size, U.S.B. flash memory drives have become a common way to carry large files from one computer to another. The tiny devices are getting even more useful, as demonstrated by the Migo from Forward Solutions, which can not only carry files but synchronize Outlook mailboxes so your correspondence is up to date no matter what computer you are using. The Migo has synchronization software that can keep documents and other files updated between different computers, and can even transfer personalized touches like your preferred desktop wallpaper and browser bookmarks to the PC at hand. In the event that personal information is to be stored in its memory, the Migo can be protected with a password for security.
12/18/2003	For the Deaf, Communication Without the Wait	THE spread of high-speed Internet access and the increasing sophistication of videoconferencing tools have given the deaf broad new access to a simple pleasure that most people take for granted: chatting on the telephone. New products and services promise to liberate the deaf from the slow text-based telecommunications systems that have been their primary option for decades. One offering, a videophone and relay service introduced by Sorenson Media, enables users to sign with each other or with banks of interpreters who translate live phone conversations between the deaf and those who hear.
12/14/2003	2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Offloading Your Memories	Can your computer be enlisted to help you remember all the details of your life? In a way, it's already starting to do that. Your e-mail files contain a good portion of your personal communication, and your calendar software has a record of every dentist appointment and staff meeting you've had in the last few years. But while it's easy to track down an address that your colleague e-mailed you six months ago, it's a bit more challenging to reconstruct a joke your friend told you during a phone call sometime in the late 90's. So why not take matters a step further and record everything? Now that most of our information streams are built out of zeros and ones, it's vastly easier to capture all those bits for posterity: every phone call, every passing conversation, every book you read or face you see -- the totality of information that flows through a human life. In the past year, a handful of separate research projects have surfaced, all sharing the same goal: offloading our memories to machines. Sunil Vemuri, a graduate student at the M.I.T. Media Lab, has spent the last two years wedded to a voice-activated microphone that makes a digital recording of every conversation he has and then transmits it to a computer, where it is cataloged and permanently stored.
12/14/2003	2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; PowerPoint Makes You Dumb	In August, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board at NASA released Volume 1 of its report on why the space shuttle crashed. As expected, the ship's foam insulation was the main cause of the disaster. But the board also fingered another unusual culprit: PowerPoint, Microsoft's well-known ''slideware'' program. NASA, the board argued, had become too reliant on presenting complex information via PowerPoint, instead of by means of traditional ink-and-paper technical reports. When NASA engineers assessed possible wing damage during the mission, they presented the findings in a confusing PowerPoint slide -- so crammed with nested bullet points and irregular short forms that it was nearly impossible to untangle. ''It is easy to understand how a senior manager might read this PowerPoint slide and not realize that it addresses a life-threatening situation,'' the board sternly noted.
12/13/2003	Corrections	The State of the Art column in Circuits on Thursday, about three cellular phones with distinct operating systems, referred incorrectly at one point to the number of American carriers offering models based on Microsoft Windows for Smartphones 2002. As noted elsewhere in the column, Verizon is one, along with AT&T Wireless. The column also included one model incorrectly among those with a speakerphone. They do not include the Motorola MPx200
12/11/2003	For Doodlers and Pack Rats, a Multimedia Binder	THIRTY-FIVE years ago, the first planned experiment for the forerunner of today's Internet was to offer remote access to a software tool designed to let researchers create, capture, organize and retrieve digital information. The notion of flexible software to augment the human mind was advanced by the pioneering computer researcher Douglas C. Engelbart. But since then, word processing software has largely been designed for those who present information rather than those collect and organize it.
12/11/2003	U.N. Meeting Debates Software for Poor Nations	Whether governments should support open-source software like Linux over commercial software like Microsoft's Windows was debated on Wednesday at a United Nations conference on closing the so-called digital divide between rich and poor countries. Samuel Guimar?es, executive secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, told government representatives at the opening sessions of the meeting that open-source, or free-to-share, software was crucial for the developing world because it would permit poorer countries to develop their own technology instead of having to import it.
12/11/2003	Conjuring a Superphone, With 3 Formulas to Choose	IN the beginning, operating systems were only for computers. Who would have guessed that one day you'd require an operating system for your watch, TV and car? Heck, before long, you'll need an operating system for your operating system. In any case, the most visible battleground for OS dominance, after computers, is the cellphone. Microsoft, Palm and a European alliance called Symbian have each devised a software engine that's supposed to manage all the functions of the modern superphone: taking photos, processing e-mail, surfing the Web, synchronizing your calendar and phone book with your computer, playing games, showing video clips, listening to MP3 music files, and -- wasn't there one more? Oh, right: making phone calls.
12/9/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Introduces Premium Net Services	Yahoo yesterday introduced its long-delayed premium service for users of high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections, apparently using a strategy of less is more. Its new Yahoo Plus service costs $5.95 a month. It competes with America Online's AOL for Broadband, which costs $14.95 a month, and a similar service from Microsoft's MSN at $9.95 a month. All of these services are meant to offer a package of features, like upgraded e-mail, virus protection and video clips, that may not be available from a cable system or telephone company providing broadband service. Yahoo is offering 10 e-mail accounts, each with more storage and some other features not included in its free service. The premium service includes software to protect against viruses and Internet intrusions and to limit the online activities of children. And it includes access to some services Yahoo has tried to sell on a stand-alone basis: premium Internet radio, telephone access to e-mail and news, and extra online storage for photos and files. Yahoo said the service would be available by the end of the month. Saul Hansell (NYT)
12/9/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Retire Some Products	Microsoft will retire several products next week, including Windows 98 and SQL Server 7, to comply with a court order related to its dispute with Sun Microsystems over Java. In a posting to its developer Web site, MSDN, Microsoft lists several older products that are being phased out and that will not be available to customers as of Dec. 15. The products to be dropped include SQL Server 7, Office XP Developer, Windows 98 and a number of Office 2000-related tools and patches. Microsoft said it would update Java-compliant versions of some products by the end of December, including Office XP Professional with FrontPage, Publisher 2002, Windows NT 4.0 and Small Business Server 2000. In the posting, dated Thursday, the company said the shift was ''due to a settlement agreement reached in January 2001'' related to Java licensing. According to an agreement reached with Sun over the distribution of the Java virtual machine, Microsoft's software has to run Java programs. Microsoft has the right to modify its Java software to fix critical bugs or security holes through Jan. 2, 2004. While Microsoft will no longer distribute the products listed, many will continue to be supported. The company plans to offer SQL Server 7 support until the end of 2007, for instance. Windows 98 support will be available, for a fee, until next month.
12/4/2003	Microsoft Eases Policy on Licensing Its Technology	Microsoft announced yesterday that it would adopt a more liberal policy for licensing its intellectual property, opening the doors to its storehouse of patents and copyrights to outsiders. The initiative is another step in Microsoft's effort to improve relations with other companies and to show regulators in the United States and Europe that it is a responsible company rather than a predatory monopolist.
12/1/2003	Microsoft's European Test	Microsoft's antitrust troubles are mostly behind it in the United States. The Bush administration's settlement of the federal antitrust suit left the company intact and its business practices little changed. Microsoft is now engaged in mopping up private suits, including a $750 million settlement with Time Warner last May. But in Europe, Microsoft still faces a severe test. The European Commission accuses it of antitrust transgressions that warrant tougher remedies. The sanctions under consideration include forcing Microsoft to remove its media player software from the Windows operating system. Such a sanction would outlaw the essence of Microsoft's business strategy -- bundling new kinds of software into Windows. A settlement or sanctions is expected early in 2004.
11/27/2003	Looking for the Perfect Mix? Create One of Your Own	If years of music lessons have proven that your child is not the next Mozart, take heart. With the Mixman DM2, there's still a chance for fame as a decomposer. The DM2 (as in squared), newly upgraded by Digital Blue and Mixman Technologies, is a scaled-down version of a club D.J.'s mixer. It enables the user to take apart a piece of music (provided it is recorded on separate tracks) and reassemble it, using a joystick and buttons to add special effects like reverb, delay and pitch bending and two turntable-like pads to add scratching sounds.
11/25/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Electronic Arts Might Miss Sales Estimate	Electronic Arts, the largest maker of video games in the United States, may miss its sales estimate for this quarter because of increased competition from companies like Microsoft and Sony, said William J. Lennan Jr., an analyst for W.R. Hambrecht. ''The competitors who lost the most share last Christmas (Nintendo, Activision, Sony, Microsoft and Konami) are much stronger this year,'' Mr. Lennan wrote in a note to clients. The president of Electronic Arts, John Riccitello, has said his company will meet its revenue forecast. Electronic Arts usually makes as much as 50 percent of its annual sales during the holiday quarter.
11/24/2003	Internet Users Shifting to Faster Services	Things are bleak, but not hopeless, for the companies that have been leading providers of dial-up Internet access, as the market shifts rapidly to faster broadband service, according to new research from ComScore Networks. In the third-quarter of the year, 24.5 million homes had broadband service, about one-third of the total homes with Internet access. Nearly all of them bought their access from their local telephone company or cable company, not America Online or Microsoft's MSN, the two leading dial-up providers. But Microsoft and AOL are having some success in persuading customers to use their services, in addition to cable or phone company broadband. SAUL HANSELL
11/24/2003	Microsoft's Monopoly, in Europe	Just when Microsoft's antitrust woes seemed over, it is facing a tough inquiry from European regulators. The Europeans are concerned that Microsoft may use its Windows monopoly to control important new parts of the tech world, including online music and video. Just as American courts ruled that Microsoft cannot unfairly use its Windows monopoly against competitors, the European Union should press Microsoft for meaningful concessions, to ensure that the software market remains competitive and consumers have real choices. European Union regulators and Microsoft sat down for three days of closed-door hearings this month. The Europeans and some of Microsoft's competitors are concerned, as our own Justice Department was when it sued Microsoft in 1998, that Microsoft may use its monopoly over the Windows operating system to limit consumers' ability to choose other products that add functions to Windows. An important battlefront, right now, is media players, the software that lets computers play music and videos. Microsoft has long provided a media player in Windows, but the technology has become more important as music and video are distributed widely over the Internet. It is important for consumers, and for fair competition, that this service not be controlled by one company.
11/17/2003	RealNetworks Says Windows Works Without Media Player	RealNetworks Inc., one of the participants in an antitrust hearing last week concerning the Microsoft Corporation, disproved claims by Microsoft that its Windows operating system depended on the inclusion of its Media Player. In a demonstration before European competition regulators on Friday, RealNetworks, maker of a music- and video-playing computer program called Real One, showed how a little-known version of Windows -- Windows XP Embedded, which is licensed only for industrial use -- can work without Microsoft Media Player attached, three people at the closed-door hearing said.
11/17/2003	Vision of Personal Computers As Heart of Home Entertainment	If Intel and Microsoft have their way, the personal computer will soon be moving out of the office and den into the living room, kitchen and bedroom. The two companies have been thwarted for more than a decade by Hollywood, as well as the cable and satellite television industries, in their efforts to put a wired PC at the center of home entertainment. But now, competing directly against many companies in the consumer electronics industry, Intel and Microsoft are mounting a new charge to try to make the personal computer the hearth of the information age.
11/15/2003	2 Microsoft Competitors Address Antitrust Hearing in Europe	Sun Microsystems and Real Networks, two companies that have the most to gain if European Union regulators force Microsoft to change the way that it operates, presented their arguments on the third and final day of a closed hearing in the antitrust proceedings Friday. Neither company would comment on the details of its presentation, but Real Networks was expected to warn regulators that if Microsoft's business practices went unchecked, it would soon have a stranglehold over all sound and video content transmitted through computers and hand-held devices like portable phones.
11/14/2003	Microsoft Seems Ready to Settle Europe Suit	Microsoft has given its strongest signal yet that it hopes to reach a settlement of the European Union's long-running antitrust case. ''We have come to Brussels not only to discuss the issues but to work things out,'' Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said Thursday. Microsoft made an eight-hour presentation in the second day of a three-day hearing on accusations that it unfairly dominated the market for operating software.
11/13/2003	European Antitrust Office Sits Down With Microsoft	Microsoft stuck to the defense it has presented before to European antitrust regulators as it opened a three-day hearing on Wednesday into whether the company was illegally abusing its dominance in operating software. The face-to-face meeting with regulators from the European Commission is the final phase of an investigation that has dragged on for nearly five years. Success for Microsoft would be to find a settlement, like the one it reached with the Bush administration last year, that would allow the company to continue to do business much as it has done before.
11/13/2003	Keeping That Whippersnapper In Touch With Grandpa DOS	For years, users of Macintosh and Linux computers have been able to play games or run software written for Microsoft's DOS operating system by using DOS emulation software. So when Microsoft released Windows XP, which removed the underlying DOS code from the Windows operating system, it suddenly became easier to run DOS software on a Mac than on a Windows PC. While XP does include a way to run some DOS programs, in many cases it will crash or the sound will not work. Microsoft may have abandoned DOS, but not everyone has. A free DOS emulator for Windows called DOSBox, available at dosbox.sourceforge.net, lets you continue to enjoy that old software.
11/11/2003	I.B.M. and Partners Promoting Linux Against Windows	Linux is a rising star in the geeky back office of computing. Its gains have come as an operating system for the data-serving computers that run corporate networks and serve up Web pages. On the desktop, Microsoft's Windows still reigns supreme. But I.B.M. and the Open Source Development Lab, whose membership includes Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Intel, are beginning a drive to promote Linux as an alternative to Windows on the desktop.
11/10/2003	Fortified by Linux, Novell Hopes to Regain Strength as a Computer Contender	Novell was left for dead years ago, another casualty of Microsoft's hegemony over computer operating systems. At the height of its popularity in the early 1990's, Novell's Netware software controlled 70 percent of the market in network server operating systems -- software that enables desktop computers to share files and communicate over a network. But for nearly a decade, the company has been losing market share to Windows NT, Unix and other programs at a rate of nearly 10 percent a year. By 2002, Netware's share of the market had shrunk to 7 percent. For the first nine months of 2003, the company reported a loss of $53 million.
11/6/2003	Microsoft Sets $5 Million Virus Bounty	Microsoft said yesterday that it was putting a bounty on the heads of virus writers. At a news conference in Washington including national and international law enforcement officials, Microsoft announced a $5 million antivirus reward program to encourage tipsters, with initial rewards of $250,000 for evidence leading to the capture and conviction of the original authors of the MSBlast and SoBig programs, which plagued Internet users this year.
11/4/2003	Microsoft To License I.B.M. Chips	Microsoft said yesterday that it had licensed I.B.M. microchip technology for use in its Xbox game consoles, a step that could help make I.B.M. the leading chip maker in the video game business. The announcement was sketchy on details, but industry analysts said the agreement was a significant endorsement for I.B.M. and a setback for Intel, Microsoft's longtime ally in the personal computer industry. Intel makes the microprocessors that power today's Xbox consoles. The I.B.M. pact applies to the next generation of Xbox consoles, which analysts expect to be introduced in 2005 or 2006, though Microsoft had not announced a shipment date.
10/31/2003	Microsoft And Google: Partners Or Rivals?	Wall Street is not the only one wooing Google. Microsoft is as well. Google, the highflying Silicon Valley Web search company, recently began holding meetings with bankers in preparation for its highly anticipated initial public offering as it was still engaged in meetings of another kind: exploring a partnership or even a merger with Microsoft.
10/29/2003	Microsoft Settles 6 More Suits	Microsoft announced yesterday that it had agreed to pay roughly $200 million to settle consumer class-action lawsuits in five states and the District of Columbia. Similar suits are pending in five other states. Executives said the settlements bring Microsoft a step closer to final resolution of its legal entanglements.
10/28/2003	Corrections	The New Economy column in Business Day yesterday about the competing visions of I.B.M. and Microsoft for the future of the Internet misstated the expected shipping date for Microsoft's next version of the Windows operating system, code-named Longhorn. It is late 2005 or 2006. (The reference to 1995 or 1996 was inadvertent.)
10/27/2003	With Cable TV at M.I.T., Who Needs Napster?	Two students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a system for sharing music within their campus community that they say can avoid the copyright battles that have pitted the music industry against many customers. The students, Keith Winstein and Josh Mandel, drew the idea for their campus-wide network from a blend of libraries and from radio. Their effort, the Libraries Access to Music Project, which is backed by M.I.T. and financed by research money from the Microsoft Corporation, will provide music from some 3,500 CD's through a novel source: the university's cable television network.
10/27/2003	New Economy; I.B.M. and Microsoft have different ideas for planning the future of the Internet.	Building the Web as a tool for transactions. ONE year ago, almost to the day, Samuel J. Palmisano, the chief executive of I.B.M., delivered a speech in New York that sketched his company's vision of the future of computing, which he called ''on-demand computing.'' Today in Los Angeles, Bill Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, will present his company's notion of where things are headed, which the software maker calls ''seamless computing.''
10/25/2003	Judge Scrutinizes Microsoft Licenses	The judge overseeing Microsoft's settlement of the government's antitrust case asked yesterday for an explanation of why only nine companies have licensed software to help their programs communicate with Windows. ''I am still interested in finding out why we don't have more licensing agreements,'' Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court told lawyers at a hearing in Washington on compliance with the settlement. The Justice Department should find out what the problem is by talking to companies that decided against buying the licenses, she said.
10/24/2003	PC Demand Helps Microsoft Beat Earnings Estimates	Lifted by strong demand in the consumer market for personal computers, Microsoft reported solid quarterly gains in sales and profits yesterday that slightly surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Microsoft said that it expected revenue and earnings for the current quarter to be somewhat higher than the average estimates of securities analysts. Corporate spending on information technology continues to be sluggish, but Microsoft's executives anticipate stronger demand from business in the first half of next year, based on conversations and surveys of customers.
10/23/2003	Apple's Latest 0.1 Adds a Lot	THE reputation of the personal computer has taken a horrible hit this year. Viruses have made headlines week after week. Spam now exceeds 50 percent of all e-mail. Hackers and academics have uncovered one Windows security hole after another, turning Microsoft into a frantic little Dutch boy at the dike without enough fingers. If the computer industry were a celebrity, it would hire an image consultant. Correction: The Windows computer industry would hire one. Macintosh fans, on the other hand, have watched the tribulations of the much larger Windows population with mixed feelings -- sympathy, relief, even amusement -- because their operating system, Mac OS X, is so far 100 percent virus-free. And because Mac OS X comes with less of its plumbing exposed to the Internet than Windows, hackers are a far more distant worry.
10/21/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Upgrade Office	Microsoft plans today to start selling enhanced versions of its Office programs that link with the company's databases and network software in an effort to fend off competition from Linux software and the Oracle Corporation. Microsoft is upgrading Office for the first time in two years after the product had the slowest average sales growth rate among the company's three largest units in the last three years. Office, which includes word processing, spreadsheet and e-mail programs, accounted for more than half of Microsoft's operating income last year. Investors expect only a modest sales increase from the new programs. Bigger gains may come later, from sales of related products like Windows and SQL database software. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has now connected those programs to Office to help fuel sales by getting companies to create more-complex programs based on Office. Microsoft shares rose 42 cents, to $29.35.
10/21/2003	Microsoft decides this upgrade of Office merits five times the promotional budget of the last one.	THERE is marketing muscle and then there is Microsoft. After all, what other company would spend five times as much to promote a product upgrade as it did on an upgrade just two years before? Could it be that Microsoft is finally hearing footsteps from competitors in the office suite software market?
10/20/2003	Europe's Antipiracy Proposal Draws Criticism	In an effort to fight product counterfeiting and piracy, the European Union is preparing to enact a sweeping intellectual property law that critics say is ill-conceived and tilted heavily in favor of copyright and patent holders. The proposal would go far beyond existing laws in Europe and the United States by classifying copyright violations and patent infringements, even some unwitting ones, as crimes punishable by prison terms.
10/20/2003	Passing the Word	Reasonably priced secure downloads. Compensation for writers and artists. Peaceful alliances between publishers and online distributors. A utopian vision for the music industry? Perhaps. But that approach, which appears to be the goal of Apple Computer's iTunes music store and others like it, is already a reality for delivering audio books and other spoken word offerings over the Internet, as created by Audible, a small company in Wayne, N.J.
10/18/2003	Microsoft Responds to European Regulators in Antitrust Case	Microsoft filed a response to European Commission regulators on Friday as the antitrust case against the company entered its final stage. Neither the company nor the commission would disclose the filing's contents. The company was responding to the commission's accusation that Microsoft abused the commanding position of its Windows operating system software to extend its dominance into related markets for server software and audio- and video-playing software.
10/17/2003	With Flair, Apple Extends Its Reach Into Online Music	Striking an alliance with America Online and a promotional agreement with PepsiCo, Apple Computer introduced its iTunes software for Windows computers on Thursday in an effort to capture a larger share of the market for downloading digital music. The announcement was the clearest statement yet by Apple that it is moving to make its distinctive brand play a vital role not just in computers but in the broader world of entertainment and mass-market consumer products as well.
10/16/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Releases First Security Update	Microsoft released its first monthly security update yesterday, following a new schedule that attempts to ease the load on overburdened system administrators. The first update consists of five vulnerabilities Microsoft deems ''critical,'' the top rating the company assigns to security flaws. The ranking is used to designate security flaws that could allow online vandals to take control of a user's computer or create an Internet worm that could spread from system to system. ''All of the five critical vulnerabilities are, of course, critical, so that means they are wormable,'' said Jeff Jones, senior director of Microsoft's security business unit. Three of the critical flaws affect all of the Windows operating systems currently supported by Microsoft, including various editions of Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Another critical flaw affects only Windows 2000, and the fifth such flaw affects Microsoft's Exchange Server 5.5 and Exchange 2000 Server products. More information on the flaws -- numbered MS03-041 to MS03-047 -- can be found on Microsoft's security Web page.
10/13/2003	Microsoft, in Middle Age, Hurries to Go Beyond the PC	When Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, gives his keynote address on Monday at the international exhibition here he plans to show off some of the company's latest technology -- software that powers mobile phones, online game machines and television services. Those areas are crucial to the company's long-term strategy, but the initiatives are all bleeding money. And so the industry is watching to see whether Microsoft, as it enters middle age, can be innovative enough to compete effectively in software platforms beyond the personal computer. The goal is to provide software giving consumers access to content from a variety of gadgets: showing family slides on a personal computer, television or game console, for example, or tapping into a personal music library from a mobile phone, TV, laptop or stereo.
10/9/2003	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Sierra To Sell Phone With Microsoft System	Sierra Wireless, a Canadian maker of wireless access cards for laptop computers, will start selling an advanced mobile phone that uses Microsoft's operating system before next July. Microsoft is trying to take market share from Nokia, the world's biggest handset maker, which uses the Symbian operating system. Nokia accounted for 78 percent of the 1.07 million so-called smart phones shipped in the second quarter in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Canalys.com said yesterday. The Voq handset, which allows users to check e-mail and listen to music, will carry the network operator's brand and is aimed at business users, Todd Heintz, Sierra's director of marketing, said in an interview. The company is ''well down the line'' to signing agreements with European carriers, he said. Sierra farmed out the manufacturing of the device to Flextronics International, the world's largest maker of electronics for other companies, Mr. Heintz said. He declined to disclose sales goals for the handset.
10/6/2003	Product Liability Lawsuits Are New Threat to Microsoft	Trial lawyers have watched with increasing interest in recent months as malicious computer viruses and worms -- all exploiting security flaws in Microsoft software -- have crashed computers and networks around the world. It is only a matter of time, they said, before the class-action suits against Microsoft start dropping. The first came last week, filed in State Superior Court in Los Angeles, asserting that Microsoft engaged in unfair business practices and violated California consumer protection laws by selling software riddled with security flaws. The suit seeks class-action status. More such suits are anticipated.
10/6/2003	Spam Fighters Turn to Identifying Legitimate E-Mail	The software engineers helped create the spam problem. Can they solve it? As politicians have been racing to find ways to ban the junk e-mail known as spam, Internet providers have been boasting about filtering technologies capable of identifying the sort of messages typically sent by spammers and disposing of them.
10/3/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Adds Microsoft Games To Site	Yahoo agreed yesterday to offer personal computer games from Microsoft in the online gaming part of its site to increase revenue from fee-based services. Financial terms were not disclosed. Fifteen new games from Microsoft will be added to Yahoo Games on Demand, Yahoo said in a statement. The additions include Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, the second-best-selling PC game in August, according to the market-research company NPD Group. Yahoo Games on Demand is part of Yahoo's strategy to add more services that consumers pay for directly. Fee revenue rose 43 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $69.9 million. A decline in online advertising in 2001 produced a 35 percent sales drop and a $93 million net loss. Shares of Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., rose $1.51, to $37.91.
10/2/2003	Software For Media Moguls	IN ''The Terminator,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger is an unstoppable machine. In the climactic battle sequence, he is blown up, incinerated and mutilated, yet he keeps on coming. Eventually, there's nothing left of him but a silver robotic skeleton that just doesn't know when to quit. In other words, a lot like Microsoft.
10/2/2003	Wave a Remote, and the Cursor Responds	JUST about everything in the computer world is susceptible to an upgrade, and the remote control included with the new Windows Media Center computers is no exception. Gyration's Media Center Remote, a combination remote control and mouse, uses gyroscopic motion-sensing technology to translate hand and wrist movements into commands that control an on-screen pointer. The result is a floating cursor control that allows the user to navigate Web sites and PC programs more efficiently.
9/30/2003	Joint Service From Reuters And Microsoft	The Reuters Group, the information services company, said yesterday that it would announce today a deal with Microsoft to connect the companies' instant messaging systems as an offering for financial services companies. The new service, to begin early next year, will allow customers of Reuters Messaging, an instant messaging service introduced last spring, to communicate with any of the 100 million people that Microsoft says use MSN Messenger, its instant messaging network. For Microsoft, the deal will for the first time allow MSN users to communicate with users of another instant messaging service, Microsoft officials said.
9/29/2003	Fixing Flaws, Microsoft Invites Attack	Microsoft's Security Response Center in Redmond, Wash., is the computing equivalent of a hospital emergency ward. When a problem comes in the door the center's director, Kevin Kean, and his staff must swiftly make an assessment: Is the security weakness detected in a Microsoft software product only minor? Or is it possibly so serious that, if exploited by a vandal's malicious code (as happened last month with the Blaster worm) it might crash computers and networks around the world? If the threat appears grave, the problem goes immediately into the center's emergency operating room, where it is attended to by a team of Microsoft engineers, working nearly round-the-clock to analyze the flawed code, anticipate paths of attack, devise a software patch to fix the defect and alert millions of customers of the problem and the patch.
9/28/2003	Ideas & Trends; The Level of Discourse Continues to Slide	IS there anything so deadening to the soul as a PowerPoint presentation? Critics have complained about the computerized slide shows, produced with the ubiquitous software from Microsoft, since the technology was first introduced 10 years ago. Last week, The New Yorker magazine included a cartoon showing a job interview in hell: ''I need someone well versed in the art of torture,'' the interviewer says. ''Do you know PowerPoint?''
9/25/2003	Flight 737, Now Departing From Your Garage	IN the quarter-century that flight simulator software has been on the market, many pilots have cited the fun of such programs as their inspiration for learning to fly. But Matt Ford, a Los Angeles lighting designer, cites the opposite, tracing his infatuation with simulation programs to his real-world flight school days. It was a warm, sunny morning in the spring of 1998, and Mr. Ford, then a resident of Dallas, was puttering over southern Oklahoma with his instructor in a Cessna 152. They flew over a site where retired airliners were stripped for parts. ''There were 30 to 40 airplanes being torn down,'' Mr. Ford recalled. ''Big DC-10's, 747's, a couple of 727's and 737's.''
9/25/2003	Microsoft's Rivals Won't Shut Chat Rooms	Microsoft's two major competitors in providing Internet services said yesterday that they had no plans to emulate its decision to shut down many free chat rooms in the United States and abroad. Free chat rooms have been among the most popular features of the Internet since long before its commercialization. But from the start, chat rooms have been considered a haven for criminal behavior, with child predators getting the most attention from law enforcement agencies. More recently, consumers have expressed frustration with the barrage of spam, including postings that link to pornographic sites.
9/25/2003	Critics Attack Microsoft Over Security	Over the years, Microsoft's flagship product, the Windows operating system for personal computers, has been denigrated by the company's critics as buggy, crash-prone and confusing to use. But a group of computer security experts went further yesterday by asserting that Windows is a threat to national security because of its complex design and monopoly reach. The claim is made in detail in a 24-page report by seven computer security specialists, and published and endorsed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group known for its anti-Microsoft posture. The trade group is appealing the government's antitrust settlement with Microsoft, and earlier this year, it filed an antitrust complaint against the software company with the European Commission.
9/25/2003	Office Buzz: Check The E-Mail	WHAT would be a good motto for Microsoft? ''Winning is everything''? ''Might makes right''? ''Money can't buy you love''? For the new version of Microsoft Office, which arrives in stores Oct. 21, a better slogan might be, ''Be careful what you wish for; you might get it.''
9/23/2003	A New Kind of Revolution In the Dorms of Dartmouth	Perhaps because of its geographic remoteness, Dartmouth College in the small town of Hanover, N.H., has long been willing to try novel means of communication. The college introduced e-mail messaging to campus in the 1980's, well ahead of most other higher educational institutions. And in 2001, it was one of the first colleges to install a campuswide wireless data network.
9/21/2003	Prevention, Not Patches, For Computer Security	To the Editor: Re ''Virus Aside, Gates Says Reliability Is Greater'' (Aug. 31), a question-and-answer session with Bill Gates of Microsoft about the recent security problems with computer viruses:
9/20/2003	A Resignation at Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that a senior vice president, Richard Emerson, who oversaw acquisitions and investments, had resigned.
9/20/2003	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday about plans by Motorola to produce a cellphone with e-mail and other computer capabilities using Microsoft's Windows Mobile software misidentified one country in which it is to be sold. It is the Czech Republic; Czechoslovakia was dissolved in 1993.
9/19/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Expanding Board	Microsoft said yesterday that it would expand its board to 10 members from 8 to strengthen its corporate governance. The company said the board had unanimously nominated Helmut Panke, 57, chairman of BMW, and Charles H. Noski, 51, a former vice chairman of AT&T. The board has also nominated the eight directors for re-election, Microsoft said. Mr. Panke is Microsoft's first director from outside the United States. ''Helmut will bring a valuable global perspective to our board,'' Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, said in a statement. ''His experience as chairman of one of Europe's most successful companies will be invaluable.'' Microsoft's shareholders will vote on election of the two new board members at the company's annual meeting in November.
9/17/2003	Microsoft's Setback in Patent Case Ripples Through World Wide Web	Watching Microsoft be sued -- by the federal government, states, class-action plaintiffs and aggrieved rivals -- has become a common pastime in the computer industry. The enjoyment of the industry spectators is usually all the greater if the world's largest software company loses, and loses big, in court. Last month, Microsoft suffered a stinging setback in a patent-infringement case when a federal jury awarded $521 million to a former University of California researcher. But this time, the rest of the industry is not smiling.
9/16/2003	Public Atlas Of the Brain In the Works	Backed by millions of dollars in financial support from Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, a team of scientists has set out to pinpoint the roughly 20,000 genes responsible for building and operating the human brain. From there, the scientists will put together a highly detailed atlas of the mammalian brain and make it available to the public through an online database. To accomplish that goal, they are relying heavily on the genome of the common mouse, which genetically bears remarkable similarities to humans.
9/15/2003	Microsoft and Motorola Said to Be in Cellphone Venture	Microsoft plans to announce today that Motorola, the second-largest maker of mobile phones, has agreed to produce a high-end phone based on the Windows Mobile software platform. The deal is a coup for Microsoft, which has struggled over the last four years to gain credibility in the mobile phone market.
9/15/2003	Profits in Missed Exits on Information Highway	Type in an Internet query, and inadvertently leave off the dot in .com, .net or .org. Or try to find, say, Target's Web site, but mistakenly tap www.taget in the browser. Everybody makes such mistakes. In fact, so many people mistype or misspell Web queries that some technology companies are trying to turn the lapses into lucre.
9/13/2003	Microsoft Says It Is Planning To Double Its Dividend	Microsoft, which joined the ranks of dividend-paying companies this year, announced yesterday that it would double the payout. The higher payment -- an annual dividend of 16 cents a share -- is still small compared with the enormous piles of cash generated by Microsoft's dominant desktop personal computer software franchises, the Windows operating system and the Office suite of programs.
9/11/2003	With Its Reinvented Wheel, a Mouse Scampers to the Side Margins	In contrast to Microsoft's high-profile plunge into the video game console business in 2001, the company's hardware group has been quietly breaking new ground with a continued focus on those PC essentials, the keyboard and mouse. After introducing the optical mouse and the now-ubiquitous scroll wheel in past years, Microsoft is introducing a new line of wireless keyboards and optical mice. Its flagship keyboard and mouse unit, which is to reach stores this month, is the Wireless Optical Desktop Elite, which among other things features a major retooling of the scroll wheel.
9/10/2003	Hacker Ran Up $300,000 Bill At The Times, The F.B.I. Says	Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged a man yesterday with hacking into the computer network of The New York Times, creating fictitious user identities and running up $300,000 in database research charges over three months last year. The man, Adrian Lamo, 22, was also accused of entering the networks of other large corporations, including Microsoft, Cingular and Yahoo, according to a complaint signed by Christine A. Howard, an F.B.I. special agent.
9/10/2003	Instant Messaging Pact Reached	The America Online division of AOL Time Warner reached an agreement yesterday with the Reuters Group to link their competing instant messaging services, raising new questions about the possibility of connecting with other such services from Yahoo and MSN. In the past, consumer advocates and communications regulators tried to press AOL, which operates by far the largest instant-messaging service, to connect with rivals so that users of all the services could obtain the benefits of communications with the broadest possible network of users, just as users of telephones, fax machines and e-mail do.
9/8/2003	E-Commerce Report; Growing concern about fraud is pushing the online world into action. The task looms large, though.	CONSUMERS are losing trust in the Internet, and online companies are taking note. The Information Technology Association of America, a trade group, said last week that it would help create the Coalition on Online Identity Theft, composed of Internet retailers and security companies allied against what has become a significant problem both online and off. Word of the group's formation came eight weeks after the announcement of another industry association, the Merchant Risk Council, which was formed to combat online credit card fraud.
9/4/2003	I.B.M. Promotes Power of Linux	I.B.M. is intensifying its battle with Microsoft over the increasingly popular Linux operating system with a big campaign to begin tomorrow, intended to burnish the image of Linux rather than sell I.B.M. products and services. The centerpiece of the campaign is a 90-second television commercial, directed by Joe Pytka, with an ethereal style, uncharacteristic of I.B.M., that is reminiscent of the film ''2001: A Space Odyssey.''
9/4/2003	Heart of Darkness, on a Desktop	THE Kiblers of Santa Clara, Calif., thought they were doing everything right. Bill Kibler, a product manager in Silicon Valley and the unofficial system administrator for his family, was nothing short of diligent about running antivirus programs. He had also erected a software firewall to shield his computer from intruders, and he regularly downloaded patches to inoculate his PC when he heard about new viruses. But over the course of six months this year, the Kiblers noticed their computer displaying some odd behavior.
8/31/2003	Virus Aside, Gates Says Reliability Is Greater	MICROSOFT, the world's biggest software maker, is the biggest target for computer viruses like the SoBig.F worm that wreaked havoc two weeks ago. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief software architect, talked last week about what it is doing to keep hackers at bay. Following are excerpts from the conversation. JOHN MARKOFF Q. You wrote a memo last year calling on Microsoft to focus on reliable software. Now we've had this series of computer-security-related events that make it appear to outsiders that you aren't making progress. Have you in fact made progress?
8/31/2003	You Call This A Midlife Crisis?	MUCH of what Microsoft has done over the last year or so might suggest a company settling into middle age. It has overhauled its management structure, tightened its financial controls, expanded its financial reporting, started paying dividends and abandoned the high-tech currency of stock options in favor of risk-free grants of shares to employees.
8/30/2003	Arrest Made In Attacks On Computers	A Minnesota teenager who the authorities said created a virulent version of the Blaster computer worm was arrested yesterday morning by federal investigators who were tracking the origin of the worm that wreaked havoc on users of Microsoft Windows. Federal law enforcement officials said that the teenager, Jeffrey Lee Parson, 18, of Hopkins, Minn., was acting alone when he copied the Blaster virus and wrote a variant known as Blaster.B. Mr. Parsons, who used the Internet name ''teekid,'' was able to develop the B version by modifying codes of the original virus.
8/28/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Microsoft To Introduce MSN Premium	Microsoft, whose MSN Internet service is losing money and customers, will sell subscriptions to use a new version of its software in a bid to attract clients. The service, MSN Premium, will cost $9.95 a month or $80 a year for a set of e-mail, security, calendar and digital-photo programs, Lisa Gurry, the MSN Group product manager, said yesterday. A version without some of the programs will cost less, she said. Sales will begin sometime in December. Microsoft is avoiding the business of selling high-speed Internet access and is pursing MSN software fees from clients using fast links from other companies. Those clients might be unwilling to pay the fee on top of access charges, analysts said.
8/28/2003	Corrections	An article in Circuits on Aug. 14 about sharing a family computer referred erroneously to one aspect of hard-drive management in the Windows XP operating system. Windows XP does in fact offer the ability to restrict a single user's hard-drive space, through a feature called Disk Quotas, when the operating system is configured to use a file system called NTFS. (Some new computers with Windows XP Home Edition are shipped with NTFS as the default; others must be converted to it for Disk Quotas to be available.)
8/26/2003	Court Rules Trade Secrets Can Outweigh Free Speech	The Supreme Court of California ruled yesterday that the First Amendment right to free speech did not mean trade secrets could be published on the Web with impunity. The ruling reversed a decision by a California appeals court. Yet the state Supreme Court's ruling is a narrow one, legal experts said, and it mostly sets the stage for further legal scrutiny of the balance between rights of free speech and intellectual property at a time when digital copies of software, music and movies can be made and distributed effortlessly over the Internet.
8/21/2003	3 Women, 3 Paths, 10 Years On	AFTER Ellen Spertus earned undergraduate and advanced degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1990's, she could have set her sights on joining the faculty at a large, prestigious academic institution. Or, like many other young technologists, she could have found a lucrative job in the Internet-driven economic boom. Yet Dr. Spertus chose instead to teach at a small liberal arts college for women, Mills College in Oakland, Calif. She went there determined to teach computer science in a way that was not only compelling and rigorous but also, as she puts it, ''nurturing.'' She is particularly dedicated to encouraging young women who seem as though they might be able to buck the statistics and enter the computing field.
8/21/2003	F.C.C. Lifts Ban on Video For AOL Instant Messaging	The Federal Communications Commission has granted a request by AOL Time Warner to drop restrictions on adding video to its AOL instant messaging service until it allowed users to communicate with other services. The repeal has been expected for months. AOL, the largest instant messaging service with about 60 percent of the market by some measures, and its rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, are racing to add voice and video connections. The decision is of most concern to consumer advocates who hope instant messaging services develop interconnections for users of different systems to send instant messages to one another, just as customers of rival phone or e-mail services do.
8/19/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Worm Variant Supplies Patch	A variant of MSBlast spread yesterday, but the new worm had an odd twist: It applied a patch for the vulnerability that it and other MSBlast worms used to infect Windows systems. The new worm appeared to properly download the patch for both Windows 2000 and Windows XP from Microsoft's Web site. Moreover, the variant will delete itself the first time an infected computer starts up in 2004. That does not mean that such worms are a good idea, said Joe Hartmann, North American director for antivirus research at the security software firm Trend Micro. Despite the apparent lack of malicious intent, the worm still sends a great deal of unwanted traffic, as it tries to spread to other computers. In addition, if several computers download the patch from Microsoft at the same time, it could slow network performance, Mr. Hartmann said.
8/15/2003	Technology Briefing | Hardware: ATI And Microsoft Sign Pact On XBox Components	ATI Technologies said yesterday that it had signed a contract with Microsoft to produce components for future versions of the Xbox game console, beating out the market leader, Nvidia. ATI said it had entered a technology agreement with Microsoft to develop ''custom, leading-edge graphics technologies'' for the console. ''We selected ATI after reviewing the top graphics technologies in development and determining that ATI's technical vision fits perfectly with the future direction of Xbox,'' Robbie Bach, senior vice president of Microsoft's home and entertainment division, said. The announcement ends months of speculation over whether Nvidia, the leading maker of graphics processors for PC's, would renew its troubled partnership with Microsoft on the Xbox. The graphics processor is the most expensive component in the Xbox, and Nvidia stood poised for a major windfall after the chipmaker won the contract shortly after the Xbox was announced three years ago. But sales problems and hardware changes left Nvidia with piles of unsold and unusable chips, putting it in a position where it could have lost money on the console if it had not submitted the Microsoft contract to arbitration. The Xbox deal has accounted for 15 percent to 20 percent of Nvidia's sales the last two years, and company executives credited Xbox-related business for a surge in profit during Nvidia's most recent quarter. Analysts had predicted the contract for the next Xbox might go to ATI, which also makes the graphics processor for Nintendo's GameCube. Microsoft has yet to set a date or reveal details on the successor to the current Xbox, despite rampant speculation from fans and game makers. While Microsoft will need to deliver new technology that can compete with Sony's successor to the PlayStation 2, it is also probably looking for ways to cut costs after after taking significant losses on the Xbox.

8/14/2003	Microsoft to Change Distribution of Vulnerable Software	Microsoft acknowledged today that it planned to change the way it distributes its flagship Windows XP operating system software, in response to a malicious software ''worm'' that has spread over the Internet in recent days attacking tens of thousands of personal computers by exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows. Dissemination of the worm slowed today as network administrators and individual computer users around the world took steps to protect their machines, even as Microsoft's critics stepped up their complaints that the company's software, which dominants the industry, puts its customers at risk of such outbreaks.
8/14/2003	Essay Texts? This Encyclopedia Booms, Flows and Rotates	While most students view interactive encyclopedias as something to dip into for help with reports and homework, the Encarta Reference Library 2004 from Microsoft strives to be something more. This collection of reference tools aims to entertain as it teaches, with a blend of text articles and multimedia content that includes movies, pictures, quotations, audio clips and timelines. Encarta 2004 replaces a shelf of books with five CD's or one DVD. Geared toward teenagers, it includes 20 science movies (32 in the DVD version) from the Discovery Channel on subjects ranging from fungus farmers to volcanoes. More than 1,000 articles have been revised and updated, and entries have been added on timely issues like the war in Iraq, West Nile virus and the Enron scandal.
8/13/2003	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about a jury award against Microsoft in a patent infringement case misstated the name of the law firm of Martin R. Lueck, who represented a plaintiff, Michael Doyle. It is Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, not Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi.
8/13/2003	Computer 'Worm' Widely Attacks Windows Versions	A malicious computer program aimed at the most recent versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system rapidly spread around the world over the Internet yesterday, infecting tens of thousands of home computers and corporate networks. Known by a variety of names -- including W32.Blaster, MSBlast and W32/Lovsan -- the viruslike program, called a worm, first appeared on Monday.
8/12/2003	National Briefing | Science And Health: New Computer Virus	A computer virus is spreading across the Internet. The rogue program, known as Blaster, is aimed at high-speed Internet users and takes advantage of a vulnerability in most recent Microsoft operating systems, including Windows 2000, NT and XP. A patch that blocks the virus has been available for weeks, but millions of users still have not gone to the www.windowsupdate.com site to download it. John Schwartz (NYT)
8/8/2003	MCDONALD'S REPORTS 9.9% INCREASE IN U.S. SALES	McDonald's said yesterday that sales in the United States rose 9.9 percent in July, driven by demand for new salads and McGriddle breakfast sandwiches. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months increased for the fourth consecutive month after declining for more than a year, the company said. The introduction of the McGriddle breakfast sandwiches and a line of $3.99 salads, along with increased advertising for the Big Mac, increased sales, it said. McDonald's shares rose 24 cents to $22.06. They have risen 37 percent in the last year.
8/4/2003	Audio Distributor Receives $6 Million From 2 Investors	Audible Inc., a company that makes audio versions of books and magazines available over the Internet, plans to announce today that it has received a $6 million investment from Bertelsmann, the German media giant, and Apax Partners, a private equity firm. Shares of Audible, which is based in Wayne, N.J., and was once a darling of the Internet boom, have fallen under $1, closing Friday at 66 cents.
8/1/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: New Windows Security Patch	Computer users running most recent versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system need to patch a major security hole recently disclosed by Microsoft, the Department of Homeland Security said yesterday. A virus taking advantage of flaws in a part of Windows that permits a ''remote procedure call'' could take full control of the target computer; computer security experts say they expect to see such viruses appear soon. A full description of the problem and how to fix it can be found at www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms03-026.asp. John Schwartz (NYT)
7/31/2003	Fortifying the In Box as Spammers Lay Siege	WHILE Congress continues to struggle with just how strict to make laws that regulate unwanted e-mail, technology is evolving to curb it, or at least separate the wheat from the chaff. Microsoft, Eudora, America Online and other software makers and Internet service providers have improved their spam filters in response to the steady increase in annoying messages sent by direct marketers, political activists and practical jokers. Yet while many applications and services filter spam, there are subtle differences among them that can affect system performance, filtering speed and accuracy.
7/31/2003	Camera-Phone Doubles As an Office	Wireless phones are continuing to morph into personal organizers that include everything but the kitchen sink. Although the new Hitachi G1000 does not offer a sink, you can at least use it to take a picture of one. The new phone comes with a built-in digital camera along with the Microsoft Pocket PC operating system, an integrated keyboard for thumb-tapping data entry and a bright screen that displays more than 65,000 colors. The Hitachi G1000, which works on the Sprint PCS wireless network, comes with plenty of software to run on the Pocket PC system, including Microsoft Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, and Outlook. The goody bag also includes Windows Media Player for multimedia files, Pocket Internet Explorer for Web browsing and MSN Messenger for instant-messaging.
7/25/2003	Microsoft Moves To Weather Time Of Slow Growth	Microsoft today outlined a new corporate approach designed to allow the company to weather a period of slow growth in the computer industry. At the same time, its executives disputed the idea that the information technology boom had ended for good. Speaking at the company's annual meeting for financial analysts here, Bill Gates, Microsoft's cofounder and chairman, announced the company's plans to increase its research and development spending this year by as much as 8 percent, to a total of $6.9 billion. The company also said before the meeting that it would expand its work force by 4,000 to 5,000 positions during the current fiscal year.
7/18/2003	Microsoft Exceeds Forecast for Sales, But Not for Profit	Microsoft yesterday reported an 11 percent gain in revenue for the quarter ended June 30, surpassing Wall Street's expectations. But the company's profits were slightly below analysts' expectations, as marketing expenses rose sharply in order to keep sales rising in the face of lingering weakness in technology spending by corporate customers.
7/17/2003	Combos For Mutt And Jeff	YOU know the TV ad for Apple's latest laptops? Two passengers sit side by side on a plane: Verne Troyer, the 2-foot-8 actor who plays Mini-Me in the Austin Powers movies, and Yao Ming, the 7-foot-5 center for the Houston Rockets. Each pulls out a laptop to watch a DVD on the flight. The joke, of course, is that Mr. Yao pulls out Apple's diminutive 12-inch model, and Mr. Troyer pulls out the 17-inch model, which seems roughly the size of Utah. If those two characters were shopping for communicators -- that is, combination cellphone-palmtops -- then Samsung would be ready for them. Its new i500, which runs on the Palm operating system, is so small that it rattles around in a shirt pocket. The other new model, the i700, runs on Microsoft's Pocket PC software; it's so big, you feel like you're talking into a romance novel.
7/16/2003	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Friday about the use of stock options and restricted stock in employee compensation plans among Silicon Valley companies misstated the tax consequences for employees. They are usually taxed at ordinary income rates, not at capital gains rates, on the difference between the price of the option and the market value on the date of exercise. The article also misstated the name of a firm that advises companies on compensation. It is the Croner Company, not the Croner Group.
7/15/2003	Corrections	The Market Place column in Business Day on Thursday, about Microsoft's new employee compensation plan, misstated the type of grants involved and their tax treatment in some circumstances. The company describes the grants as restricted stock ''units,'' not restricted stock. The company says that device has tax consequences different from those of restricted stock. An employee who receives restricted stock and elects to pay taxes immediately, based on the shares' current value, can take a capital loss if the shares are later sold at a loss. But as the column said, that employee would be hurt if the stock failed to vest -- that is, failed to become the employee's property -- as might happen if the employee left the company prematurely. Microsoft says its restricted stock ''units'' entail transferring no actual stock until it has vested -- that is, until the employee qualified to own it outright. The employee who receives restricted stock units will owe taxes based on the value of the stock when it actually vests -- an event that begins to occur one year after the grant. The employee will not have any choice regarding tax treatment. The article also misstated Microsoft's plan to restate its earnings to treat the value of previously granted stock options as an expense. It will restate its financial statements for the fiscal year ended in June 2002, but not for earlier periods.
7/14/2003	Eliminating Options at Microsoft	The news from Redmond, Wash., is not good for anyone still hoping for a return of the financially exuberant 1990's. Microsoft, the software giant that minted hundreds of millionaires by doling out stock options to a generation of employees who happened to be at the right place at the right time, will no longer grant stock options. The move reflects a change in business culture as well as the evolution of an iconic American corporation. There is nothing inherently wrong about rewarding employees with options -- a form of compensation that is dependent on a company's future success. Many corporations, including The New York Times Company, have stock option plans, and options will likely remain an important fixture of Silicon Valley's entrepreneurial culture.
7/10/2003	For Newer Microsoft Employees, a Sense of Redress	Throughout the 1990's, just about everybody here knew somebody who had become one of the fabled Microsoft millionaires. These were people who had come to work for Microsoft in nearby Redmond, and -- sometimes even as low-paid secretaries or entry-level programmers -- became so wealthy from stock options that they could afford to retire rich at any time. But for the new generation of employees -- that is, anyone who joined Microsoft after the dot-com boom turned into a bust and the stock market began to plunge -- becoming a Microsoft millionaire has seemed like an impossible goal. And that cannot be a pleasant thought for the newer employee who knows a veteran, sometimes seated at the next cubicle, who has already made millions.
7/10/2003	Some Xbox Enthuasiasts Microsoft Didn't Aim For	AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased.
7/10/2003	Corrections	A front-page article yesterday about the decision by Microsoft to stop giving stock options to employees misstated the date and price of the peak in the company's shares. The stock, which closed on Tuesday at $27.70, peaked in December 1999, not March 1999. The value of the stock at its peak, adjusted to take account of splits, was $59.56, not $178.
7/10/2003	Market Place; Microsoft workers will now receive stock. But the tax effects are complex, expensive or both.	THE decision by Microsoft to grant restricted stock to all employees will assure them of getting some value, but it will also present them with a difficult decision to make regarding taxes. Employees who are bullish on Microsoft may choose to pay taxes earlier than they have to, but at the risk of suffering big losses if things do not go as they hope.
7/9/2003	Microsoft Will Award Stock, Not Options, to Employees	Moving away from a pay system that showered riches on a generation of entrepreneurs and engineers, Microsoft said yesterday that it would no longer grant stock options, relying instead on actual awards of stock to help pay its 50,000 employees. The announcement is the clearest sign yet that stock options have lost some of the cachet they held a few years ago. Microsoft's move also comes as some big investors are putting pressure on companies to award fewer options, calling them a prime example of corporate excess in the 1990's.
7/8/2003	STATE CHECKING INTO REPORT OF MICROSOFT IMPROPRIETY	Massachusetts, the only state still challenging Microsoft's antitrust settlement with the Bush administration, is investigating whether the company retaliated against a computer maker for promoting a rival operating system. The state said in a court filing on Thursday that was made public yesterday that Microsoft had ''retaliated'' against an unnamed company for promoting the Linux operating system. Microsoft's Windows operating system runs more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers. A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Desler, denied that the company had violated the agreement, saying it ''is complying fully with all aspects of the consent decree.''
7/4/2003	Microsoft Eases Licensing Under Pressure From U.S.	Microsoft, in response to prodding from the Justice Department, has made a series of changes intended to make it easier and less expensive for industry competitors and partners to license technical information from the company. But despite the easing of some licensing restrictions, the government and several states said in a court filing yesterday that they remain concerned by certain Microsoft practices and planned to address those concerns in a scheduled conference with a federal judge on July 24.
7/3/2003	Searching For Novelty In a Palmtop	REMEMBER palmtops? Back in the golden age (circa 1996), they were thrilling and new. Every time Palm Computing sneezed, shockwaves went through the electronics community. There was one new model every year, and it vaulted straight onto the covers of techno-magazines. For the discerning gadget freak, life was a breathless adventure. Today, where are the palmtops? They're in every fifth row of the plane or train, hanging on shrink-wrapped cards at Wal-Mart, yours free with paid subscription. The magic has been diluted. Buying a palmtop these days is an event no bigger than buying shaving cream or inkjet refills.
6/27/2003	Court Lifts Order That Required Windows to Include Java	A federal appeals court gave Microsoft a reprieve yesterday by sweeping aside a lower court injunction that ordered the company to distribute the Java software of its rival Sun Microsystems. Microsoft's victory was qualified, however. The three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., upheld a second preliminary injunction by the lower court that told Microsoft to stop distributing its version of Java technology because it probably violated Sun's copyright on the software. The second opinion, legal experts said, suggests Sun has a fairly strong case in its private antitrust suit against Microsoft.
6/26/2003	Online Chat With Faces Attached	INSTANT messaging certainly has its charms. You and a conversation partner on the Internet type back and forth in a narrow window, your quips scrolling up the screen like a hastily written script. The fact that you can't see or hear the other person is either the best feature or the worst, depending on how self-conscious you are and how your hair looks. Better start combing. Last week both Microsoft and Apple incorporated audio and video into their popular chat programs, now called MSN Messenger 6 and iChat AV. You can download them free at messenger.msn.com or apple.com/ichat, respectively, as part of a public beta test -- a software company's way of saying, ''Sure they're buggy, but what do you want for free?''
6/26/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Gates Seeks Measures To Fight Spam	Bill Gates, who said unsolicited commercial e-mail was a ''spreading plague that feeds off the unique power of the Internet,'' has called on the technology industry to develop a strategy of self-regulation to deal with the problem. In a letter posted yesterday on the Microsoft Web site, Mr. Gates pointed to some of the measures his company has taken against spam. They included improved technology and more than a dozen civil lawsuits filed against companies and individuals that Microsoft asserts sent billions of spam messages in violation of state and federal laws.
6/18/2003	Microsoft Sues 15 Organizations In Broad Attack On Spam E-Mail	Microsoft, the world's largest provider of e-mail accounts, filed lawsuits yesterday against 15 groups of individuals and companies that it says collectively sent its clients more than two billion unwanted e-mail messages. Unwanted e-mail, commonly called spam, has been a fast-growing problem for many e-mail users. The Hotmail service from Microsoft, with 140 million users, has been a fat target for spammers.
6/17/2003	State and Microsoft Settle	Microsoft agreed yesterday to pay as much as $21 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of overcharging West Virginia consumers for its Windows operating system. West Virginia also agreed to drop its challenge of an antitrust settlement Microsoft had reached with the Bush administration and 17 other states, leaving Massachusetts as the only state pursuing the challenge, a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Desler, said.
6/14/2003	Holy Change Agent! Consultants Edit Out Jargon	The people blamed for incentivizing companies to repurpose, build mindshare and utilize change agents have taken aim at their own lingo. Deloitte Consulting, an arm of the accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, has developed a free software program, Bullfighter, that identifies jargon in documents. The goal is to make it easier for investors to decipher what companies are trying to say, said Chelsea Hardaway, the Deloitte marketing director who led the team that designed the software.
6/14/2003	No Concession From I.B.M. In Linux Fight	I.B.M. said yesterday that it had no intention of reaching a quick settlement with the SCO Group, a small company based in Lindon, Utah, in a legal fight that is causing concern among the many corporations that use the increasingly popular Linux operating system to handle some computing chores. The SCO Group filed a suit against I.B.M. in March, arguing that I.B.M. violated its contract with SCO by copying code from the Unix operating system to Linux, which is distributed free and is used by I.B.M. on some of its computers.
6/12/2003	Cable Is Confident of Internet Lead Over Phone Rivals	The cable industry has grown up, and it has taken on a new swagger. The industry that started out with the transmission of television programs has matured into a broad-ranging provider of telecommunications, using digital technology to offer video-on-demand, phone service and, in particular, high-speed Internet connections.
6/12/2003	Microsoft Swats at Stealthy Web Bugs	PRIVACY advocates say a shift by Microsoft could effectively marginalize a particularly intrusive use of Web bugs, the tracking and profiling devices used by online marketers and spammers. Last month Microsoft retooled its Hotmail service, adding a feature that allows users to block Web bugs placed inside e-mail messages. A similar option exists in the most recent version of Microsoft's widely used Outlook Express e-mail program, and the company says the next release of its other e-mail program, Outlook, will block the tracking mechanisms by default.
6/12/2003	2 PC Makers And Sun Cut Deal for Java	Sun Microsystems moved a step closer today to making its Java programming language a force in personal computing when Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer agreed to include Java software with their desktop and laptop computers. Industry executives and analysts have viewed the inclusion of Java as a standard software component on personal computers as an indicator of the effectiveness of the antitrust settlement the Justice Department reached last year with Microsoft.
6/11/2003	PeopleSoft Bid Mirrors Lofty Goals of Oracle Chief	Lawrence J. Ellison, the 58-year-old chairman of Oracle, whose hobbies include yachting and piloting jet-fighter planes, has earned his reputation as one of the most flamboyant and outspoken executives in corporate America. His brash public pronouncements -- whether vilifying a rival like Microsoft or declaring that Silicon Valley is finally growing old -- tend to be taken with a handful of salt. Oh, that's just Larry, is a common reaction in the industry to what are seen as Mr. Ellison's antics.
6/6/2003	European Regulators Seek More Evidence in Microsoft Inquiry	European competition regulators are seeking more evidence in their investigation of Microsoft, a move that is almost certain to delay further the five-year-old antitrust inquiry. The European Commission sent a questionnaire to music and movie companies two months ago, asking them how they view the technologies they use to disseminate material over the Internet.
6/5/2003	Microsoft Leader Tells Workers of I.B.M.-Linux Threat	In a long e-mail message to Microsoft employees yesterday, Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, singled out International Business Machines as the company's chief corporate rival and the rise of free software like Linux as a threat to Microsoft's lucrative portfolio of products. Mr. Ballmer expressed optimism about the long-term growth opportunities for Microsoft and the computer industry. But for now, he noted, many customers are skeptical. ''As I talk with business customers,'' he wrote, ''there is less passion and enthusiasm for technology, and greater focus on doing more with less.''
6/4/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Offer Authentidate Service	The Microsoft Corporation said that it would offer AuthentiDate Holding's USPS Electronic Postmark service to users of Microsoft Word. Shares of AuthentiDate rose nearly 17 percent on the news. The postmark service will allow Microsoft Word users to verify the authenticity of electronic documents and to add time and date stamps, AuthentiDate said in a statement yesterday. AuthentiDate's agreement with Microsoft has no explicit dollar value and will allow the company access to Microsoft's customer base, Richard Reichgut, AuthentiDate's vice president for marketing, said in an interview. AuthentiDate, which developed its electronic postmark service through an alliance with the United States Postal Service, stores proof of an electronic document's status at a given time for up to seven years, certifying that it has not been altered, for example. Shares of AuthentiDate rose 53 cents, to $3.73. In another development yesterday, Microsoft and VeriSign Inc. will jointly develop security software, the companies announced. Their next-generation software will focus on improving access security for remote connections and wireless networks. The new platform is expected to be available later this year. VeriSign shares gained $1.01, or 6.8 percent, to $15.80. Microsoft added 24 cents, or 1 percent, to $24.88.
6/2/2003	Digital Media Becomes Focus As Microsoft And AOL Settle	The corporate armistice declared last week between Microsoft and AOL Time Warner reflected two companies moving from the past to the future. The abandoned past included a last lingering vestige of the Internet browser wars of the 1990's, a private antitrust suit that Microsoft has now agreed to pay AOL Time Warner $750 million to settle.
6/2/2003	In Computing, Weighing Sheer Power Against Vast Pools of Data	For almost two decades the federal government has heavily underwritten elaborate centers to house the world's fastest supercomputers. The policy has been based on the assumption that only government money could ensure that the nation's research scientists had the computing power they needed to pursue projects like simulating the flow of air around a jet airplane wing, mimicking the way proteins are folded inside cells or modeling the global climate. But now two leading American computer researchers are challenging that policy. They argue that federal money would be better spent directly on the scientific research teams that are the largest users of supercomputers, by shifting the financing to vast data-storage systems instead of building ultrafast computers.
5/31/2003	AOL Emerges With the Edge In the Truce With Microsoft	AOL Time Warner and Microsoft presented the agreement they announced Thursday as a new era of cooperation between two longtime rivals. But on closer inspection, the terms of the deal largely require Microsoft to cooperate with AOL while inviting AOL to reciprocate at its pleasure. That suggests that Microsoft is not gaining any particular advantage as it seeks to conquer new software markets related to the Internet, including instant messaging and digital distribution of audio and video programming.
5/30/2003	MICROSOFT TO PAY AOL $750 MILLION; END TO 'LONG WAR'	Microsoft agreed to pay AOL Time Warner $750 million in a legal settlement yesterday that ends one of the most bitter rivalries in modern corporate history and commits the two companies to a sweeping program of business cooperation. Under the agreement, Microsoft will grant AOL a seven-year royalty-free license to its Internet browsing software, and faster and greater access to Microsoft's Windows operating system. That will make it easier for AOL's popular online service to work with Windows software, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.
5/29/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Loses Munich Contract To Linux	Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, is losing a contract to supply its Windows operating system for 14,000 Munich government computers because the city is switching to Linux. The conversion to Linux, a freely distributed, open-source program, will begin in 2004, the city said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The city did not announce what company would be hired to make the change. Open-source programs let developers see the underlying code, make changes and pass along the result to others. The city's decision ''doesn't just ensure more provider independence for its I.T. infrastructure, but also sets a signal for more competition in the software market,'' said Christian Ude, the mayor of Munich, in the e-mailed statement. The switch by Munich, Germany's third-largest city, after Berlin and Hamburg, may help determine software purchases of other regional governments. Germany's Interior Ministry has framework agreements with Microsoft and I.B.M., which sells computers with Linux.
5/28/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: SAP To Form Partnership With MySQL	The open-source software model received another endorsement yesterday when SAP, the big German software company, said it would form a technical partnership with MySQL, which makes an increasingly popular open-source database program. The goal of the agreement is to enable SAP's software, which automates an array of corporate operations including benefits and procurement, to run on the MySQL database. SAP software already runs on the databases made by Oracle, I.B.M. and Microsoft. MySQL distributes its database free according to open-source practices, but also offers it under a commercial license for corporate customers that prefer it. MySQL collects revenues from both licensing and maintenance fees. As part of the agreement, SAP will hand over its own fledgling open-source database project, which had only a few thousand users, to MySQL, which is used on about four million computers. ''This is part of the commoditization of database software,'' said Marten Mickos, chief executive of MySQL. ''SAP has acknowledged that trend and it wants to make sure it has a commodity database that works with SAP products.'' Steve Lohr (NYT)
5/28/2003	Microsoft Sells Its Stake in Telewest at Loss	Microsoft said in a filing yesterday that it had sold its stake in Telewest Communications for $5 million in cash, less than three years after buying the shares for $2.6 billion in stock. IDT, a telephone company that has been buying distressed rivals, bought the stake, Microsoft said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft owned 22 percent of Telewest's outstanding stock as of March.
5/26/2003	New Economy; A Unix company hopes a Microsoft deal will strengthen its legal case against Linux.	JUST when it seemed like nothing was going the company's way, the SCO Group received a piece of good news last week. Microsoft announced it would license a Unix patent from SCO along with the source code. To SCO -- which recently changed its name from Caldera Systems -- this would mean the Linux software industry could see that SCO's Unix intellectual property claims were legitimate and enforceable. If things now play out in SCO's favor, the company might be able to at least slow the momentum of Linux, which has been engulfing the computer server market at Unix's expense.
5/26/2003	Microsoft Finds Some Doubters For the Motives Of Its Largesse	Even when the Microsoft Corporation attempts to do good, its critics distrust its motives. The company is significantly increasing its donation of software to the nation's nonprofit organizations, to a level that may approach $1 billion annually in the next three to four years, according to the organization that will distribute the software. Executives at nonprofit organizations are applauding the expected increase in donations, up from $207 million in estimated retail value last year.
5/24/2003	MICROSOFT'S CHIEF PLANS TO SELL SOME OF HIS SHARES	Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation, is selling an undisclosed number of shares in the company for the first time in 12 years to diversify his assets. Mr. Ballmer's last sale, of 65,000 shares, was in May 1991, according to the Washington Service, which tracks insider share sales and purchases. Mr. Ballmer owned almost 471 million shares, or 4.4 percent, of Microsoft as of September. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., will not disclose the number of shares Mr. Ballmer is selling until he files a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Rachel Wayne, a spokeswoman.
5/22/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: I.B.M. Beats Oracle In 2002 Database Sales	International Business Machines, the world's biggest computer maker, unseated Oracle as the top seller of database software last year, the market researcher Gartner Inc. said yesterday. I.B.M.'s share of the $6.63 billion market for relational database programs rose to 36 percent in 2002 from 34 percent in 2001, Gartner said. Oracle's portion slipped to 34 percent from 40 percent. The Microsoft Corporation's share grew to 18 percent from 14 percent. The total market fell by 6.9 percent. In recent years, I.B.M. has focused on increasing sales of database programs by expanding partnerships with software companies like PeopleSoft Inc., Siebel Systems Inc. and SAP, whose applications store information in databases. I.B.M. and Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, have gained business by undercutting Oracle's prices, analysts have said.
5/20/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Buy Unix Licenses From Caldera	Microsoft will buy some rights to use the Unix computer operating system from Caldera International Inc., bolstering Caldera's legal challenge to the rival Linux software. Microsoft bought the licenses to ensure its Windows-based programs would work with Unix software, the companies said in a statement. The value of the deal was not disclosed. Caldera has said the low-cost Linux operating system contains some of its Unix code and companies that use or promote Linux might owe it royalties. Caldera, which is changing its name to SCO Group, is suing I.B.M. and has warned 1,500 other companies. Microsoft, which calls Linux the chief threat to its Windows software, is endorsing a legal challenge that may raise the price of Linux, analysts said.
5/16/2003	Microsoft Official Tells of Use of Special Fund	The head of European operations for Microsoft said today that money from a special fund intended to capture deals with governments and large institutions could be spread throughout Europe. ''We have a consistent approach across Europe,'' said Jean-Philippe Courtois, Microsoft's chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. ''We would obviously use that either in Western Europe or Eastern Europe.''
5/15/2003	Instant Messaging Moves Beyond Chat to Multimedia	''I'M pretty much on instant messaging from when I get home until I go to bed,'' said Laura Gittleson, a 15-year-old in Colts Neck, N.J. She is not alone. America Online, the service Ms. Gittleson uses, says 195 million people use its instant messaging service, their keystrokes generating more than 1.6 billion messages a day. For those users, instant messaging -- or IM -- has become an intrinsic part of their social fabric.
5/15/2003	How Microsoft Warded Off Rival Software	At least 90 percent of the world's personal computers run on Windows software. But Microsoft wanted still more. Last summer, Orlando Ayala, then in charge of worldwide sales at Microsoft, sent an e-mail message titled Microsoft Confidential to senior managers laying out a company strategy to dissuade governments across the globe from choosing cheaper alternatives to the ubiquitous Windows computer software systems.
5/13/2003	Game Maker Snubs Microsoft's Xbox	Electronic Arts, the video game publisher, said today that it would not make online versions of its popular sports games available for Microsoft's Xbox game console for at least a year, signaling a failure of more than two years of negotiations between the companies. Executives at Electronic Arts, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., said that they were worried that Microsoft was seeking to gain greater control over their customers who participate in online games on the Xbox.
5/12/2003	Compressed Data; Apple Tweaks Microsoft Over a New Computer	A few years ago, when Steve Jobs introduced Apple's popular iMac computer, his archrival, Bill Gates, groused that Apple had reduced innovation in the personal computing world to translucent colored plastics. ''The one thing Apple's providing now is leadership in colors,'' Mr. Gates, the head of Microsoft, said at a conference for financial analysts at the time, News.com said. ''It won't take long for us to catch up with that, I don't think.''
5/10/2003	NVIDIA SHARES SURGE AFTER STRONG SALES FORECAST	The Nvidia Corporation, whose computer graphics chips help run Microsoft's Xbox video game console, said yesterday that its second-quarter sales might top forecasts, setting off a 33 percent gain in its share price. Sales in the second quarter ending in July may rise as much as 18 percent, to $478 million, from the first quarter because of demand for Xbox chips, Nvidia executives said. Shares of Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., rose $5.31, to $21.37.
5/9/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Corrects Security Flaw In Passport Program	Microsoft, which had more than 70 security flaws last year, said yesterday that it had fixed a problem in its Passport user authentication program that could have allowed unauthorized access to millions of Web site accounts. Passport users have a single account name and password that can allow access to hundreds of Web sites without repeatedly entering the same information. There were no reports of unauthorized access caused by the flaw, Adam Sohn, a product manager for Passport, said. The program has 200 million active accounts and is used at more than 300 Web sites. Microsoft settled an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission last year by pledging to improve Passport's security. The F.T.C. said Passport deceived users by failing to protect the privacy of e-mail addresses and credit card numbers that were used to authenticate user identities. An F.T.C. lawyer, Jessica Rich, would not say whether the commission was investigating the security failure.
5/8/2003	DVD Release Tests Format By Microsoft	YET another video release of ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (1991) would not seem notable, even on DVD. But for Microsoft, the new version amounts to the first test of a concept. The two-disc set, to be released in June by Artisan Home Entertainment as ''T2: Extreme DVD,'' will have a list price of $29.98. One disc will include a digitally remastered high-definition version of the film, with enhanced 5.1-channel surround sound, using a new Microsoft format called Windows Media 9. It promises almost three and a half times the resolution of a traditional DVD.
5/7/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: I.B.M. Gains Lead In Some Software Sales	I.B.M. the world's second-largest maker of software, behind Microsoft, gained the sales lead for the first time last year over rivals like BEA Systems and SAP for two major types of software. I.B.M.'s share of application-server software sales rose to 37 percent from 31 percent in 2001, said Joanne Correia, an analyst at Gartner. BEA's share slipped five percentage points, to 29 percent. I.B.M.'s sales of software for work collaboration increased to 13.5 percent, while SAP's share fell to 9.7 percent. I.B.M. is increasing its software sales as customers slow their purchases of computers as the economy and corporate profits sag. Two-thirds of I.B.M.'s sales this year will be from computer services and software, up from half in 1998, the company has said. Sales of its WebSphere application-server and work-collaboration software rose 14 percent in the first quarter, I.B.M. said last month. Officials from BEA Systems did not return telephone calls yesterday seeking comment.
5/7/2003	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Gates Introduces New PC Prototype	Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, yesterday demonstrated a prototype for a new personal computer built with the Hewlett-Packard Company that will be used for handling phone calls and teleconferencing. The Athens prototype has a wide-screen display and a video camera and phone attached to the screen. Hewlett will add features from Athens to PC's next year, said Lewis Kim, marketing director for Hewlett's worldwide business desktop unit. Those advances ''encourage people to jump in and get something new,'' Mr. Gates said in an interview. ''Our innovations are why demand has gone up a little bit this year instead of going down, which, given the general economic conditions, you wouldn't expect.'' Microsoft is working with PC makers on new designs it hopes can increase computer sales, as many companies switch to replacing PC's every four to five years, rather than more frequently, said Tom Phillips, general manager of Microsoft's Windows Hardware Experience Group. Mr. Gates spoke in New Orleans at the Windows hardware engineering conference for companies that build computers and devices with Microsoft's Windows operating system. Microsoft shares rose $1.30, to $27.79.
5/6/2003	When Goliath Comes Knocking on David's Door	WHEN the world's biggest companies do business with the millions of minnows on the commercial landscape, the outcome can be tough for the little guys. Small companies routinely sustain losses struggling to get -- and keep -- the attention of giants that they hope to supply with products or services. But those who operate small businesses say that buying from a behemoth can also lead to pain.
5/1/2003	Microsoft's Antitrust Problems Remain Unresolved in Europe	A senior European antitrust official said today that Microsoft had yet to resolve concerns about the way it competes in the European software market. ''We still have outstanding concerns,'' said Philip Lowe, the most senior civil servant in the European Commission's competition division.
4/28/2003	Slate Sets a Web Magazine First: Making Money	Web purists who long believed that Slate, the online magazine founded by Michael Kinsley and bankrolled by Microsoft, was never a bona fide digital media service now have a final, damning piece of evidence. In the first quarter of this year, Slate took in more money than it spent.
4/28/2003	3 E-Mail Giants Will Join In an Effort to Reduce Spam	The three leading providers of e-mail accounts said yesterday that they had started to work together to develop ways to reduce the unwanted commercial messages, commonly known as spam, that are increasingly clogging their customers' mailboxes. The companies -- America Online, Microsoft and Yahoo -- are calling for technical changes in the way e-mail is passed around cyberspace to make it easier to determine who really sent it and what it is about.
4/24/2003	Microsoft Tries to Conquer The Corporate Data Center	In announcing the third generation of its software for controlling corporate data centers, Microsoft is eager to convince the world that it is now confidently outpacing the competition. ''This is about scaling up,'' Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, said in a recent telephone interview. ''We can now compete with the most expensive machines in the world.''
4/16/2003	Microsoft Exceeds Expected Profit But Stays Cautious	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company, posted slightly higher-than-expected quarterly earnings yesterday even as it adopted a cautious outlook, warning that the personal computer industry remains sluggish, in part because consumer confidence is so fragile. The company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., reported a net profit of $2.79 billion, or 26 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, beating analysts' estimates by 2 cents a share. That is up from a profit of $2.74 billion in the third quarter of last year, or 25 cents a share.
4/13/2003	In Searching the Web, Google Finds Riches	IN the last few years, Google has risen as a force on the Internet by offering its smarter, faster searches as a free public service. Now the band of technoinsurgents who run the company are striking a blow against the business strategies of giant Web portals like America Online, Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN by rewriting the rules of Internet advertising. Emerging as a powerful new marketing medium, Google has found a route to profitability that stands apart in a Silicon Valley that is still crippled by the dot-com crash.
4/10/2003	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Microsoft Sues Lucent Over Patents	Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, has filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate six patents owned by Lucent Technologies. Lucent, which makes computer networking gear and is the largest maker of telephone equipment in the United States, has sued Dell Computer and Gateway over the inventions, which include color memory, video-search functions and a method for controlling a computer with a stylus. Microsoft says Dell and Gateway want the software maker to reimburse them for any damages they have to pay as a result of the suits. A Lucent licensing agent called ThinkFire has also sent letters to Microsoft, saying 16 Lucent patents are ''crucial to the current and planned product offerings of Microsoft.'' Microsoft wants a judge to rule that its products do not infringe the six patents in the Dell and Gateway suits. Alternatively, the suit seeks a ruling that the patents are invalid or unenforceable. Microsoft is waging its patent dispute with Lucent as it defends its intellectual property in antitrust litigation with the government and competitors. A Lucent spokesman, John Skalko, said the company had no comment on the federal lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in San Diego.
4/10/2003	Microsoft to Allow Partners To Alter Some Source Code	Microsoft announced yesterday that it would allow its industry partners to modify and then redistribute the underlying programming code used in cellphones, hand-held computers, television set-top boxes and other small devices. The new policy does not apply to Microsoft's mainstay products in personal computer desktop software and data-serving software that runs computer networks.
4/3/2003	Tell a Story in Pictures, And the Palmtop Unlocks	For help in developing a password protection system for hand-held computers, Pointsec Mobile Technologies turned to an unexpected resource: teachers of children with learning disabilities. ''We were told that people remember visual things like pictures much better than numbers or letters,'' said Doug Chalmers, the president of the company's United States division.
3/23/2003	What They Were Thinking	Rather than being angry at the United States for having to register with the I.N.S., Mohammad Jamil should be looking to fellow Muslims like Fadi, the young man who loves Microsoft but hates America. He and others like him who call for jihad against the United States are to blame for the actions now being taken by our government to protect our citizens. However difficult for Jamil, it is absolutely necessary for us. C.B. Scholl Westport, Conn.
3/18/2003	Microsoft to Focus Effort On Corporate Data Centers	Now it is Microsoft's turn. With budgets tight, corporate computing customers have increasingly looked to cut costs in their data centers -- the technology engine rooms that run the computer operations of large corporations. Big information technology suppliers like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems have stepped forward with products and services to address the data center problem.
3/18/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: New Security Hole In Microsoft Software	A newly discovered security hole in Microsoft software allows intruders to take over a target Web server by sending a tiny scrap of code. The new hole affects computers running a part of Windows 2000 known as Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, which allows users to work on Web pages remotely. Russ Cooper, a Microsoft security expert at the TruSecure Corporation, said yesterday that the machine that was attacked was a poorly secured server used by the U.S. Army and that the attacker was using the target computer to probe other machines. Mr. Cooper said that the affected machine was probably a relatively unimportant server, since the Army incorporates more stringent security measures on critically important systems. The vulnerability affects only users of Windows 2000; later versions of Windows are shipped with the vulnerable functions turned off to avoid inadvertent security problems, a Microsoft spokesman, Sean Sundwall, said. John Schwartz (NYT)
3/17/2003	Microsoft Is Said to Shift Strategies for MSN Service	Is Microsoft charting a new course for its MSN online service? IDC, the big technology research firm, certainly thinks so. In a report posted on Thursday on its Web site accessible to clients, IDC said Microsoft had abandoned its goal of trying to overtake America Online as the largest online service. ''MSN,'' the report states, ''has adopted a new strategy -- to ultimately become a portal or software company, with customers obtaining their own Internet access from any source.''
3/11/2003	Instant Messaging Leaves School for Office	Instant messaging, long associated with teenagers staying up late to chat online with friends, is moving into the workplace with an impact that has started to rival e-mail and the cellphone. Less intrusive than a phone call and more immediate than e-mail, instant messaging is finding users far more quickly than e-mail did when it was first introduced, according to Forrester Research, a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. In the last year alone, Forrester said, the number of instant messages has grown by more than 50 percent, so that nearly one-third of American adults are now IM-ing, as it is called, with their children, clients, colleagues and each other.
3/9/2003	Loves Microsoft, Hates America	Fadi is a 23-year-old unemployed computer programmer who lives in his parents' apartment in a nice, middle-class neighborhood in Amman, Jordan. Down one street is the big Amman McDonald's, down another is Fadi's mosque, where he prays several times a day. Stocky, with a big, messy beard, Fadi speaks softly, hunched over, looking at the ground. When he makes an important point, he asks you to repeat it, and when you show you understand, he lifts his head, leans back with a great smile and says, ''Sah,'' ''correct.'' One day, he explained to me in careful detail why he wants to be a shaheed, a suicide bomber against the United States, quoting at length from the Koran. But when he's not talking about blowing himself up and killing American troops, Fadi talks about his other great dream. ''I want to be a programmer at Microsoft,'' he says. ''Not just a programmer. I want to be well known, famous.'' Fadi gives me a tour of his parents' apartment: it is long and narrow, with a private living room for the family and another, more ornate one, for guests. Fadi's bedroom is in the back, and it is small and bare. Everything Fadi has on display sits on a small desk: a copy of the Koran, in blue leather with ornate gold Arabic script on the cover, and a few boxes of audiotapes that he listens to every day.
3/7/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Invest $2 Billion In Programs	Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, will invest $2 billion in the next fiscal year to sell programs to companies with fewer than 500 workers, after it moved a top executive to head that effort. The budget for sales, product development and partner programs for small and medium-sized businesses represents a ''significant'' increase from the current year's budget, a Microsoft spokeswoman, Erin Brewer, said yesterday. She declined to be more specific. Microsoft said yesterday that it would have its top sales executive, Orlando Ayala, lead a new group selling the software. Small and midsize businesses spend $420 billion on computer-related gear now, and that figure will reach $750 billion by 2006, Mr. Ayala said. Microsoft's small-business unit, which competes with Intuit and Sage Group, had a loss of $93 million last quarter on sales of $139 million. Shares of Microsoft fell 17 cents, to $23.27.
2/28/2003	Microsoft Settles an Antitrust Complaint Filed by Taiwan	Microsoft has settled an antitrust complaint filed by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, but the sides differ on how much the company has actually conceded. Chen Chi Yuan, the vice chairman of the regulatory commission, said in a telephone interview today that part of the deal involved a commitment by the company to reduce prices for its computer software in Taiwan by 26.7 percent. But Microsoft said later that while it had decided to lower its average prices for academic and consumer users in Taiwan by 26.7 percent, it had done so in connection with a new marketing campaign announced today and not as part of the settlement itself.
2/23/2003	Sun, Again, Bets Against the Odds	SCOTT G. McNEALY, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, was pacing the stage in San Francisco two weeks ago, working hard to stir up enthusiasm in the crowd for his company's new products. The litany of offerings was long and impressive -- data serving computers of all kinds, graphics workstations, storage networks, software. The implicit message was clear: Sun, though battered by the high-technology slump, is still churning out new products and new ideas. Dressed in blue jeans and a khaki shirt, Mr. McNealy, ever blunt and informal, was helpfully translating the benefits of Sun's wares in plain terms. He gestured toward one of Sun's zippy small server computers. ''Think of these as piston rings,'' said Mr. McNealy, who grew up in suburban Detroit, the son of an auto executive.
2/20/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Buy Some Assets Of Connectix	Microsoft said late yesterday that it would purchase some of the assets of the Connectix Corporation, a small maker of so-called virtual machine software, based in San Mateo, Calif. The deal includes the company's flagship product, Virtual PC, which permits Macintosh users to run applications written for Microsoft Windows and Intel-based personal computers. Virtual PC software is crucial for Apple Computer because it permits corporate users to run Windows-based applications that do not exist for the Macintosh. Of greater interest to Microsoft, Connectix has developed a similar product for Windows-based PC's that permits computer users to run multiple operating systems, including Linux, simultaneously. The Silicon Valley company also recently entered the market for server computers used by corporations. The software permits a single Intel computer to simultaneously run a variety of operating systems, including Windows 2000 Server, Unix and Linux. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. John Markoff (NYT)
2/20/2003	Where's the Remote? A Tiny New Answer	The Griffin Mobile Total Remote started off as an attempt to create a remote control for the Apple iPod music player. It ended up as a tiny module that turns a hand-held Pocket PC computer into a master remote that can operate more than 300 kinds of gadgets, from DVD players to ceiling fans. In a nod to its origins, the Total Remote plugs into the hand-held's headphone outlet. Software supplied with the unit contains onscreen interfaces and connection software for various devices. (Additional software covering several thousand more products can be downloaded from the Web.) Unlike universal remotes with fixed buttons, the Total Remote frees users from trying to remember, for example, whether they use the volume or the channel controls to speed up the ceiling fan.
2/17/2003	Microsoft Loosens Apple's Hold on Schools	Apple Computer, formerly the undisputed leader in sales of personal computers to schools, has steadily lost ground over the years to lower-priced PC's that run Microsoft Windows software. And these days the company faces another threat in the education market: a proposed class-action legal settlement by Microsoft that could result in the donation of hundreds of millions of dollars of Microsoft software to needy schools throughout California. Under the deal proposed last month, Microsoft would offer more than $1 billion in vouchers, ranging in price from $5 to $29, for technology from Microsoft and its competitors to California consumers who bought Windows, Office and other Microsoft products from 1995 to 2001.
2/17/2003	Microsoft in Second Deal To Sell Phone Software	Microsoft executives said today that T-Mobile, Germany's leading cellphone carrier, would announce on Monday that it would start selling ''smart phones'' using Microsoft software. It will be the second such alliance for Microsoft in Europe. As the annual 3GSM World Congress for the wireless industry opens here, Microsoft, a relative latecomer to telephone software, is trying to gain a stronger foothold in the field. It trails Symbian, which is made by and licensed to Nokia, Motorola and some other cellphone makers.
2/17/2003	Group Program Manager Bids Flippant Farewell to Microsoft	People leave Microsoft all the time, and many of them pass along their departing thoughts in e-mail messages to their colleagues. But the missive sent by David Stutz, a respected technical thinker within the company for more than 10 years, is more intriguing than most. In his last job, Mr. Stutz, 46, was a group program manager for Microsoft's ''shared source'' initiative -- a crucial effort at the company to deal with the threat from the open-source software movement partly by sharing more Microsoft code with universities and industry partners. And after leaving the company on Feb. 7, Mr. Stutz last week posted what he termed a ''sanitized version'' of his retirement e-mail message on his personal Web site (www.synthesist .net).
2/16/2003	Business; Who's Blocking the Xbox? Sony and Its Games	XBOX, the video game console that Microsoft introduced nearly 14 months ago, is technologically sophisticated and, by many accounts, the best way to play games against competitors over the Internet. But the advantages have not translated into the returns Microsoft had hoped for. It has sold nine million Xbox consoles, on the low end of its projections; it continues to lose money on each one it sells; and it remains desperately behind Sony, whose PlayStation 2 is selling at a record pace. Wall Street analysts have mixed opinions about whether Microsoft's early effort has been successful, but they agree that it has a way to go.
2/13/2003	Scrawl To Screen, With a Pen	A LAPTOP may make a powerful portable office, but as a pure note-taking device, it is not universally considered an improvement over handwriting. In meetings, the laptop's screen becomes a wall that psychologically isolates you from the group. For people who don't touch-type, handwriting is faster, too. And then there's the clicking of the keys -- a distinct liability when it comes to note-taking in, say, church. If people at Microsoft are reading this, they're surely whooping and high-fiving; these, after all, are the very problems that the company's Tablet PC design is intended to address.
2/12/2003	Rivals of Microsoft File Antitrust Complaint in Europe	An alliance of technology companies said today that it had filed a new complaint with European antitrust regulators about the Windows XP operating system of Microsoft, just as the regulators were nearing the end of an investigation into earlier versions of Windows. The alliance, called the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said in a news conference today that Microsoft's dominance was stifling innovation and competition in the development of software for all kinds of digital devices, from computers to mobile phones. The alliance includes Sun Microsystems, a longtime foe of Microsoft, as well as companies like Nokia, AOL Time Warner, Eastman Kodak, Fujitsu and Oracle.
2/11/2003	As an alternative to pop-up ads, marketers are trying to create useful Web sites to draw viewers.	A WEB site built by MSN for Lexus, the maker of luxury cars, hopes to attract customers by applying the increasingly important dictum of online advertising: make yourself useful. The site, called Luxury for Living, contains links to Lexus advertisements, but it is dominated by lifestyle information on topics including luxury hotels, high-technology homes and farmers' markets. It also contains links to outside sites like Slate.com and MSNBC.com. Hoping to make users feel relaxed and pampered, the site plays music: piano, jazz or ''new luxury,'' the music from Lexus commercials.
2/6/2003	Pocket PC's For Smaller Pocketbooks	PROFESSIONAL technology reviewers have one thing in common with lawyers, therapists and dermatologists: they are frequently approached by advice-seekers at parties. Consider, for example, the frequent question, ''What palmtop should I buy?'' For this, the gadget guru generally trots out Cocktail Party Response 342-B: ''First, choose which camp you want to join: Palm or Pocket PC. A Palm is small, simple and inexpensive. A Pocket PC is bigger, heavier and pricier -- but it has a lot more features.''
2/6/2003	Watching a Cold Front Advance Across Your Palmtop Screen	Weather reports on television have long been accompanied by a swirl of computer-animated images and photographs. More recently, weather sites on the Web have followed along. But weather information that can be downloaded or received wirelessly by hand-held computers has, until recently, been no more active than an old-fashioned printed chart of temperatures.
2/4/2003	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Court Stays Ruling On Java Technology	Microsoft won a round in its private antitrust fight with Sun Microsystems yesterday. A federal appeals court agreed to shelve temporarily a lower court order requiring Microsoft to carry Sun's Java technology in the Windows operating system. On Dec. 23, Judge J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court in Baltimore issued the ''must carry'' order, ruling that Microsoft had to include the Java programming language and related technology for its anticompetitive behavior. In an appeal on Jan. 22, Microsoft called Judge Motz's order ''extreme and unprecedented.'' The federal appeals court agreed to stay the must-carry order pending appeal, which could take weeks or months. Microsoft said it was pleased with yesterday's ruling, while Sun expressed regret.

2/3/2003	Competitors Shape Strategy To Gain Edge In Web Services	Quietly, with no press release, Microsoft decided last month to change the name of its next major product. The new version of its software for running computer networks, which was long billed as Windows .Net Server 2003, will drop the ''.Net'' when it comes to market this spring. The branding change furrowed many a knowledgeable brow in the computer industry. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, had often said that .Net was a ''bet-the-company strategy'' for its flavor of Web services, a software technology intended to enable seamless machine-to-machine communication.
2/3/2003	As Broadband Gains, The Internet's Snails, Like AOL, Fall Back	America Online now has some company in the Internet doghouse. Last week, the company said the number of subscribers to its flagship Internet service, by far the nation's largest, had fallen in the fourth quarter, the first decline in its history, further contributing to the woes of its parent, AOL Time Warner. But executives at the America Online division can at least find solace that its plight is shared by the other leading dial-up Internet access providers, EarthLink and Microsoft's MSN, which also have shrinking numbers of dial-up subscribers.
1/31/2003	Microsoft to Alter Online System to Satisfy Europe	To avert a clash with European regulators over data privacy, Microsoft has agreed to make ''radical'' changes in the workings of .Net Passport, its online authentication system, regulators said today. According to a statement released by a committee of data protection registrars from each of the 15 European Union member states, Microsoft agreed to ''a radical change of the information flow'' and other changes to better protect consumers' addresses, ages, phone and credit card numbers and other personal details.
1/30/2003	Europe Said to Agree on Microsoft Privacy Issues	Data-protection officials from the 15 member nations of the European Union will ask Microsoft to make additional changes to Passport, its online customer authentication system, people close to the officials' deliberations on the matter say. The officials concluded a two-day conference here today with an agreement on how to respond to offers by Microsoft to bring Passport into compliance with the union's strict data privacy laws.
1/28/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Approval Sought For Nominee To Microsoft Panel	The federal judge who approved Microsoft's antitrust settlement with the government was asked yesterday to appoint Edward Stritter, a computer scientist, to a committee that will oversee the company's compliance. Mr. Stritter, former director of business development for Cisco Systems' wireless unit, was nominated by the other two prospective members of the panel. The Justice Department asked Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to name Mr. Stritter along with the other two panel members, Harry Saal, a software industry executive, and Franklin Fite Jr., a former Microsoft manager. Mr. Saal was nominated by the government and Mr. Fite by Microsoft. The panel will referee complaints by competitors and customers that Microsoft is not complying with the terms of the settlement, negotiated after an appeals court upheld findings that the company illegally protected its Windows monopoly. Microsoft shares dropped 68 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $49.17.
1/28/2003	Worm Hits Microsoft, Which Ignored Own Advice	The frantic message came from the corporation's information technology workers: ''HELP NEEDED: If you have servers that are nonessential, please shut down.'' The computer system was under attack by a rogue program called SQL Slammer, which affected servers running Microsoft software that had not been updated with a patch -- issued months ago -- to fix the vulnerability. The worm hindered the operations of hundreds of thousands of computers, slowed Internet traffic and even disrupted thousands of A.T.M. terminals.
1/23/2003	New Group to Oppose Proposals on Digital Piracy	Some technology companies and consumer organizations are planning to announce today that they have formed a lobbying alliance to oppose technology regulations that are favored by the motion picture industry. The idea for the new organization, Alliance for Digital Progress, was born last year when Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, introduced a bill intended to prevent consumers from exchanging unauthorized copies of movies, music and television shows over the Internet.
1/20/2003	As Linux Nips At Microsoft, Its Advocates Talk Numbers	The evidence is now overwhelming that Linux, once a symbol of software's counterculture, has become a mainstream technology. The Linux World conference that begins in New York tomorrow promises to be a staid, corporate affair. The speakers' list is filled with corporate technology people who will be there to discuss the dollars-and-cents rationale for Linux, an operating system that is distributed free and developed according to open-source principles, in which programmers donate their labor to debug and modify the software cooperatively.
1/17/2003	In a Surprise, Microsoft Says It Will Pay Dividends	Declaring its most threatening legal problems over and its business strong, Microsoft surprised Wall Street yesterday by announcing it would begin paying a dividend. The step is significant mostly as an indication of the maturing corporate culture and psychology at Microsoft. But it does not seem to be a concession by the company's longtime leaders -- Bill Gates, the chairman and co-founder, and Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive -- that Microsoft, the prototypical high-technology growth company, is slowing down.
1/16/2003	Yahoo Plans Big Expansion Of Broadband	Buoyed by its growing sales and profits, Yahoo is planning to take its high-speed Internet access service nationwide. Yesterday, the big Internet portal announced better-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter of 2002. It was able to expand its sales of online advertising, even as it added new services that generate monthly fees from users.
1/15/2003	Microsoft to Give Governments Access to Code	To try to slow the acceptance of the Linux operating system by governments abroad, Microsoft is announcing today that it will allow most governments to study the programming code of its Windows systems. Under the program, governments will also be allowed to plug their security features instead of Microsoft's technology into Windows. More than two dozen countries, including China and Germany, are encouraging agencies to use ''open source'' software -- developed by programmers who distribute the code without charge and donate their labor to debug and modify the software cooperatively. The best-known of the open source projects is GNU Linux, an operating system that Microsoft regards as the leading competitive threat to Windows.
1/14/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Wins Legal Case	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday won a legal fight to bar two computer trade associations from appealing a judge's approval of its antitrust settlement with the U.S. government and nine states. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly rejected arguments by the Software & Information Industry Association and the Computer & Communications Industry Association that an appeal is required to protect their interests in a competitive market. ''Nothing prevents (the groups) from pursuing their own antitrust suits against Microsoft,'' Judge Kollar-Kotelly said, citing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s private lawsuit seeking billions of dollars in antitrust damages. The settlement that Judge Kollar-Kotelly approved requires Microsoft to give computer makers freedom to promote rival products on personal computers.
1/9/2003	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Bush's Plan Taxes Certain Dividends, Fine Print Reveals	Not all corporate profits are created equal under President Bush's tax plan. Neither are all dividends. Details of the president's plan show that dividends will continue to be taxed when paid by companies that do not pay federal income taxes themselves. Companies with losses or those that use various techniques that eliminate taxable income will find they have no tax-free dividends to hand out.
1/9/2003	A Microsoft Watch Will Provide Much More Than Time	Microsoft, continuing its effort to extend its reach beyond computers, today introduced designs for a new class of watch that gives more than the time and a pocket audio and video player. The designs, which will be available from several manufacturers by the end of the year, were presented by Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, in a speech today that opened the annual International Consumer Electronics Show here.
1/8/2003	Few Officials At Companies Expect Surge In Dividends	We'll keep our cash, thank you. So say many of the large companies that do not pay dividends to their shareholders, predicting that President Bush's plan to eliminate the tax on personal dividends will not impel them to make a quick change.
1/8/2003	Apple Branches Out, Offering 2 Software Programs	Five years after returning to lead Apple Computer, Steven P. Jobs introduced software today in areas that others had long since ceded to Microsoft: a free Web browser tailored for the Macintosh and a $99 program for making elaborate business presentations. Microsoft's Internet Explorer dominates the Web browser market, even on the Macintosh, and its PowerPoint software holds virtually all of the presentation software market. Neither of those positions is likely to be jeopardized quickly by the announcements today.
1/7/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Tries To Strengthen Position	In a bid to secure a central place in the new gadgets that are increasingly the preferred platform for digital media, Microsoft said yesterday that it would license its Windows Media technology to consumer electronics makers at lower prices and better terms than its main competitors do. Will Poole, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Windows New Media Platform division, said the goal was not to reap a huge profit but to ensure that PC's that run the Windows system work well with devices like camcorders, DVD players and portable media players that consumers want to use with them. The more prevalent its playback and security technology is on consumer devices, the better position Microsoft is in when it tries to sell its technology -- and Windows systems -- to companies that want to deliver material in digital form. Amy Harmon (NYT)
1/7/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Appeal On Microsoft Fought	Microsoft and the Justice Department asked a federal judge yesterday to bar two computer industry trade groups from appealing the settlement of the long-running Microsoft antitrust case, which she approved in November. The Software Information Industry Association and the Computer and Communication Industry Association, which have called for tougher restrictions on Microsoft's business practices, have asserted that the settlement does not serve the public interest and should not be permitted to stand without an appellate review. But the Justice Department said the trade associations had failed to show that they would be harmed if they could not appeal. ''Neither the federal courts nor the parties should be required to endure further proceedings at the behest of trade associations that have made only vague claims of harm to their members -- who remain nameless,'' Microsoft said in its filing. Amy Harmon (NYT)

1/2/2003	And Now, the Portable Desktop PC, Up to a Point	AS I compose this text, I'm lying on the living room couch, a glass of leftover eggnog next to me on the end table. My PC is actually upstairs in another room. I'm word processing on a Microsoft Smart Display, a cordless flat-panel screen that serves as a portable window onto the main computer elsewhere in the house. Unfortunately, it has no keyboard. It has taken me 20 minutes to write this much.
12/30/2002	Glass Panes And Software: Windows Name Is Challenged	There is no question that Microsoft Windows, the name of the dominant personal computer operating system, is one of the leading brands in the world. Today, Windows is the face of computing for nearly 400 million people worldwide -- the software that determines the look and basic operations of more than 90 percent of all PC's. But success, money and monopoly, it seems, do not put even so familiar a name as Microsoft Windows beyond challenge. An upstart company, Lindows.com, is trying to persuade the Federal District Court in Seattle to invalidate Microsoft's trademark on Windows.
12/24/2002	Microsoft Loses a Round To Rival Sun	A federal judge ruled yesterday that Microsoft must include the Java programming language of Sun Microsystems with the Windows operating system, handing Sun a victory in its private antitrust case. In granting a preliminary injunction sought by Sun, the judge forced Microsoft to confront what would be perhaps the most intrusive penalty yet to stem from court rulings that it broke federal antitrust laws.
12/17/2002	Limits Sought On Net Access Without Wire	The Defense Department, arguing that an increasingly popular form of wireless Internet access could interfere with military radar, is seeking new limits on the technology, which is seen as a rare bright spot for the communications industry. Industry executives, including representatives from Microsoft and Intel, met last week with Defense Department officials to try to stave off that effort, which includes a government proposal now before the global overseer of radio frequencies.
12/12/2002	In the Home, a Tool Kit For a Wireless Network	OUT in Silicon Valley, they have a brilliant saying: ''Easy is hard.'' Making advanced technology seem simple enough for typical consumers, in other words, can be staggeringly difficult. These days, in fact, it may be a losing battle, as evidenced by the millions who have love-hate relationships with their cellphones, PC's and word processors. Rarely has there been such a clash of mentalities -- engineer versus consumer -- as there is in wireless networking, whose popularity is nonetheless one of the bright spots in the PC industry this season. Sure, it's nice to take a laptop online wirelessly in coffee shops and airports. But the much bigger wireless explosion, if less publicized, is taking place in American homes.
12/9/2002	In Software, Still Testy After All These Years	They are like an old divorced couple, I.B.M. and Microsoft. They have a long history of mutual admiration and animosity. Formerly partners, they still cooperate from necessity in a spirit of wary pragmatism, but they are fierce antagonists. Now, the rivalry is heating up and, once again, the battlefield is software. Friday's announcement that I.B.M. plans to pay $2.1 billion for Rational Software, a leading supplier of software tools, is another significant step in I.B.M.'s aggressive drive to build its prowess in software based on Internet standards. In so doing, I.B.M. is positioning itself as the main challenger to Microsoft and its dominance of the software industry.
12/6/2002	Judge Likens Microsoft's Effect on Java to a Bang on the Knee	Microsoft hobbled Sun Microsystems the way Tonya Harding's supporters kneecapped a rival figure skater before the 1994 Olympics, a judge overseeing a private antitrust case against Microsoft said today. The judge, J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court here, made the comparison in challenging Microsoft's argument that it should not be forced to include Sun's Java program in Windows, the Microsoft software that operates 95 percent of personal computers. Sun says it is entitled to compensation for the harm that Microsoft inflicted on Java.
11/30/2002	Massachusetts to Press Microsoft Antitrust Case	Massachusetts announced yesterday that it would fight on in court to try to toughen the sanctions against Microsoft in the company's long-running antitrust case. Seven other states and the District of Columbia said they would not appeal a federal judge's order earlier this month, which did little to strengthen a settlement reached last year between the Bush administration and Microsoft. West Virginia said it would decide on Monday, the deadline for deciding whether to appeal.
11/30/2002	Microsoft Antitrust Case In Europe Takes New Turn	A top European Commission official has left to join Microsoft, just weeks before he was due to give his opinion on the European antitrust lawsuit against the company. The commission said today that it saw no potential conflicts of interest in the move. But rivals of Microsoft say the company has hired away an unsympathetic official at a crucial time in the Europeans' antitrust case against the company.
11/25/2002	A Conundrum For Hewlett: How to Angle Its PC Business	On the main floor of the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas last week, Hewlett-Packard was showing off how its technology is used to do everything from fine-tune Formula One racing cars to rendering computer-animated movies like ''Shrek.'' But what could be just as important to the company's future were the wares on exhibit in a nearby room, off the show floor. There, the company offered a glimpse of an advanced personal computer it hopes to have on the market by 2004. It was a sleek, black PC with high-quality videoconferencing, enhanced instant-messaging and immediate data-sharing and collaboration capabilities. The project, code-named Agora, is a collection of inventive computing and communications technologies, some of which come from Hewlett-Packard's research laboratories.
11/25/2002	Compressed Data; Apple's Quirky Ads Evoke Parodies of Themselves	Apple Computer's quirky ads have never been as good at building market share as ''mind share,'' or buzz. The current campaign, with Macintosh users talking of why they switched from the Microsoft Windows world to Apple products, has received so much attention that imitations and parodies are showing up across the Web. Many of the fake ads use the same distinctive plinky-twangy music and stark white background of the originals. The site Macboy.com, for one, offers brief cartoons with such unlikely Apple switchers as Bill Gates and the ubiquitous ''Steve'' from Dell Computer's ad campaign. (''My name is Steve, and, dude, I'm getting a Mac.'')
11/22/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: U.S. And Microsoft Propose Compliance Panel Candidates	The Justice Department yesterday asked a federal judge to approve two software industry figures to serve on a compliance committee charged with helping enforce an antitrust settlement with Microsoft, the world's largest software maker. The department proposed Harry Saal, who founded a company that became part of Network Associates Inc., according to court documents. Microsoft suggested Franklin Fite, who served as a general manager and director in eight years at Microsoft. The third member will be selected by the other two members after they are confirmed. Earlier this month, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington approved Microsoft's settlement with the Bush administration and rejected most proposals made by nine states for additional restrictions on the company. The settlement called for the appointment of the committee within 30 days of the final judgment. Shares of Microsoft rose $1.22, to $57.84.
11/21/2002	The Active Life, With a Digital Assist	Two agencies have shifted employees on two major accounts. Harry Corsham was named senior vice president and Microsoft brand director at the San Francisco office of McCann-Erickson Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Mr. Corsham, 45, assumes operational duties for Microsoft that had been handled by Michael McLaren, 38, executive vice president and director for client services, who will focus on strategic development, the agency said.
11/21/2002	Employee Shifts At Two Agencies	To the Editor: Re ''The Old Computer: Upgrade or Retire?'' (Basics, Nov. 14): The headline should have been ''The Old PC: Upgrade or Retire?'' I use and maintain both PC's and Macs, and when I upgrade one of my Macs, I allow an hour and rarely need more. For PC's, I have learned through bitter experience to schedule a day or two.
11/21/2002	Upgrade a Mac Instead	A group of technology and media companies including Microsoft, Disney Yahoo and eBay plans to send a letter to the Federal Communications Commission today arguing that the open nature of the Internet will be lost unless the agency amends its broadband policy. The formation of the group signals a growing fear that the F.C.C., in an effort to spur investment in broadband Internet services, is ceding control to a handful of cable and phone companies over a network long seen as inherently immune to controlling influences.
11/18/2002	The Education of Bill Gates	Colfax, Wash., lies just a few miles west of the Idaho border, in a farming region where the hills roll across the horizon like an ocean swell and streets are mostly empty except for an air of dereliction. Bill Gates went there recently to admit what Colfax must have found obvious: that the computers he had donated to small-town libraries all across the country had not done what he predicted they would do, which is to help halt the exodus from rural America. Ultimately, that prediction -- made in his 1995 book, ''The Road Ahead'' -- said as much about Mr. Gates's ignorance of rural America as it did about his hopes for the future of the Internet. He seems to have believed that providing Internet service to rural libraries would bring enough basic infrastructure, information and connectivity to keep communities intact. The computers have been a good thing, but had he talked seriously to anyone living in farm country, he would have found that more basic and more important infrastructures were also missing, things like decent transportation, convenient medical care, promising jobs and, most important of all, enough people in the neighborhood to make a thriving community. Those things once existed in rural America. They made life there not merely tolerable but pleasant and fulfilling.

11/16/2002	MICROSOFT INTRODUCES XBOX LIVE FOR ONLINE PLAY	Microsoft yesterday introduced Xbox Live, the online component to its fledgling video game platform. The product, which allows users to play games against each other over the Internet, may provide insight into whether there is a market for such services, industry analysts said. Microsoft is hoping the product provides momentum to sales of XBox, which greatly lag those of Sony's industry-leading Playstation II. Microsoft said that about 5,000 retail outlets had begun selling the XBox Live Starter Kit, which, for $49.95, includes a one-year subscription to the service, and a headset that lets people communicate with each other while playing games. Matt Richtel (NYT)
11/16/2002	WorldCom Beats Microsoft for Ex-Compaq Chief	WorldCom, the troubled long-distance communications carrier, announced yesterday that Michael D. Capellas, a former president of Hewlett-Packard, had agreed to become chairman and chief executive. While the announcement was expected, Mr. Capellas had been considering a competing offer to become the No. 3 executive at Microsoft until early Thursday, according to people close to the search process. These people said that soon after reports appeared Monday that Mr. Capellas was in the running for the WorldCom job, Microsoft approached him with a lucrative offer to become its president and chief operating officer. In that job, Mr. Capellas, 48, would have reported to Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and Steve Ballmer, the chief executive.
11/14/2002	A Heavy Lifter for the Move From Windows to Mac	Packing up and moving all your things from one place to another can be stressful, whether the destination is a new house or a new computer, and a cross-platform move may even seem more daunting than a cross-country relocation. For those who are jumping from a Windows machine to a new Macintosh computer, the new Move2Mac kit from Detto Technologies can make transferring files quicker and easier than copying them all onto Zip disks or burning a stack of CD's. Move2Mac includes a special U.S.B. cable and software that can move photos, documents, spreadsheets, folders and music files between machines. Address book, database files, Internet Explorer favorites and certain system settings can also be transferred from PC to Mac, and it takes about 15 minutes to move 500 megabytes of data.
11/14/2002	A Guru, Visiting India, Is Welcomed to Seattle	Old if they were over 30, the elite of India's high-tech revolution sat today in a food court at Infosys Technologies Ltd., Domino's pizzas stacked in the background, awaiting their guru. The air was heavy with expectation, which, when the man himself appeared, turned into a standing ovation. Bill Gates was in the house.

11/14/2002	Using a Hard Drive to Show Films in Theaters	As the major Hollywood studios bicker with theater owners over who should pay for the digital equipment that allows films to remain free of dirt and scratches no matter how many times they are viewed, a luxury carmaker and the world's largest software company have stepped into the breach, casting themselves as the unlikely champions of independent digital cinema. BMW and Microsoft are spending several million dollars to exhibit eight independent films in digital format over the next year at theaters in 25 cities. The first is ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown,'' a documentary about the Funk Brothers, studio musicians whose role in creating the Motown sound made famous by vocalists like Marvin Gaye and the Supremes is little known.
11/14/2002	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about plans by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to give $100 million to combat H.I.V. and AIDS in India misstated the timing. While saying there is no fixed period for distributing the money, Mr. Gates and foundation officials have projected that it will be given out over 5 to 10 years; he did not say it would be given out over 10 years. Also because of an editing error, the article referred incompletely to Microsoft's offices in India. There are five in addition to those in Bangalore and Hyderabad.

11/14/2002	Operating Systems Matter	To the Editor: Re ''Forget the Files and the Folders: Let Your Screen Reflect Life'' (Essay, Nov. 7): What began with a topical discussion of Microsoft's monopoly quickly degenerated into hucksterism. Despite the author's impressive credentials, his claim that Windows is a ''reliable, solid'' operating system, among other incredible statements about Windows, caused knowledgeable readers to laugh out loud and look for the advertisement banner.

11/14/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Executive Will Retire	Microsoft said yesterday that Deborah Willingham, the senior vice president for human resources and the company's highest-ranking woman, would retire in February to pursue personal interests. The company is interviewing replacements for Ms. Willingham, 46, according to a spokeswoman, Stacy Drake. Ms. Willingham, who has been at Microsoft for almost a decade, previously ran the marketing for the Windows operating system and led the unit that sells Microsoft products to large customers. Microsoft has been short of senior managers for its operations units like human resources since the former president and chief operating officer, Rick Belluzzo, quit in May, leaving departments like human resources and finance reporting to the chief executive, Steve Ballmer. Ms. Willingham intends to travel, engage in charity work and seek positions on corporate boards. She was not immediately available to comment.
11/13/2002	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Microsoft To Invest $400 Million In India	Moving to expand in one of the largest emerging markets, the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, announced yesterday in New Delhi that the company would invest $400 million in India over the next three years. The company hopes that the investment will develop a new generation of computer users, expand access to and the use of Microsoft operating systems and desktop applications, and increase the company's technology and product development operation in India. India, already a major global exporter of software, is well poised to capitalize on the next stage of digital evolution, Mr. Gates said, citing the country's strong education system and improving communications. He laid out four areas where Microsoft would invest. In education, it will spend $20 million to help increase computer literacy. In addition, Mr. Gates said, Microsoft will expand the India Development Center in Hyderabad, will expand its Web-connected services and will make Windows XP and Office with a Hindi-language interface.

11/11/2002	Bill Gates to Tour India Amid Global Software Debate	Taking the case for Windows software to a crucial audience, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, is set to begin a four-day tour of India today. This country has an estimated half-million individual software developers, many of them writing programs for some of the world's largest corporations. Mr. Gates's visit, his third to India, comes as programmers around the world are being lured to join the so-called open-source computing movement, which favors the Linux operating system -- available free or in low-cost software packages -- over proprietary systems like Microsoft Windows.
11/9/2002	Microsoft Names Committee To Oversee Orders by Court	Moving swiftly to follow a federal judge's order, Microsoft announced yesterday that it had appointed a three-member committee of its board to make sure the company carries out court-ordered antitrust rules. The compliance committee will be led by James I. Cash, a professor at the Harvard Business School who joined the Microsoft board last year. The other two members of the board committee are Raymond Gilmartin, chairman and chief executive of Merck, and Ann McLaughlin Korologos, a former secretary of labor during the Reagan administration.
11/7/2002	Forget the Files and the Folders: Let Your Screen Reflect Life	THE end of the Microsoft trial is great news whatever you think of the defendant -- because the trial was all about the past, and we in the technology world have no more time to waste on that topic. The trial focused on Microsoft's Windows operating system -- on the power Microsoft gets from Windows' huge worldwide penetration; on the burdens that other software companies bear because of their limited access to the Windows software; on accusations that Microsoft was suppressing innovation. The courts have officially labeled the gigantic software company a monopoly, and Microsoft will be subject to careful scrutiny for abusive activity.
11/6/2002	Silicon Valley's Dream Tablet, From Microsoft	A notepad-size computer controlled by a pen has long been one of Silicon Valley's most cherished ideas -- and one of the most elusive. In unveiling its new tablet computer system amid much fanfare on Thursday, Microsoft of Redmond, Wash., is betting that it can succeed where dozens of Silicon Valley companies have failed. The pen computing vision has consistently led to the valley's most spectacular commercial flops. Among them were failed efforts like Grid, Agilis, the Go Corporation, Eo, General Magic, Apple, Momenta and others.
11/5/2002	Microsoft's U.S. Settlement Won't Clear Path in Europe	Last Friday's ruling in the settlement of the Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft forces the company to make more concessions than it has offered so far to the European Commission, which is also pursuing an antitrust action. But the settlement in the United States, as endorsed by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington, will not easily serve as a template for resolving the case in Europe, officials here said today.
11/5/2002	Reining In a Monopolist	The most significant antitrust case in decades and one of the epic courtroom battles of our time seem to have drawn to an anticlimactic close. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's ruling on Friday upholding the settlement reached last November by Microsoft, the federal government and nine states was the proper one. Nine other states challenging the settlement, largely on behalf of Microsoft competitors, failed to make a convincing case that the judge should radically alter its terms. We say this, admittedly, with some dread. The settlement appears to be in the public interest, but enforcing the decree's terms so as to prevent Microsoft from again abusing its Windows computer operating system monopoly to thwart competition will prove a daunting challenge.
11/4/2002	Microsoft Must Turn To New Set Of Hurdles	The ruling on Friday by a federal judge, rejecting strong sanctions against Microsoft, means it will not have to change its ways much despite its antitrust violations. But while Microsoft has squelched the competitive challenge posed by Internet browsing software, the ''Internet threat'' that so worried it in the 1990's is still alive and well, though in a very different form. The rise of the Internet has affected the technology industry in three main ways, each of which tends to discourage monopoly power. First, no single company controls the Internet's crucial technical standards. Second, it is a low-cost technology and though essentially a communications technology, it has helped accelerate the advance of low-cost economics in computing generally. Third, as a decentralized technology, the Internet holds the promise of dispersing market power.
11/4/2002	Marketers Try to Turn Web Pirates Into Customers	A growing group of online marketers have a new name for the millions of people who use Internet file-trading software to steal music: ''customers.'' The ranks of these marketers include independent bands with little to lose and established companies like Microsoft. What they have in common is that they are starting to view the masses of Internet pirates as a possible source of revenue. They have begun to experiment with promoting their wares on file-trading services, which are typically used to obtain unauthorized copies of music, movies or software.
11/3/2002	Life With Microsoft Still Stifling for Rivals	At the end of a four-and-a-half-year court battle and distracted by a gloomy high-technology economy, Silicon Valley today largely took Microsoft's victory in a federal antitrust case on Friday as a foregone conclusion. Living with Microsoft has increasingly meant staying away from markets that the company controls as a result of its desktop computer software monopoly and looking for niches that are not likely to attract Microsoft's attention.
11/3/2002	FIVE QUESTIONS for DAVID M. SMITH; Sizing Up the Ruling In the Microsoft Case	A FEDERAL judge on Friday approved most provisions of an antitrust settlement reached a year ago between the Microsoft Corporation and the Justice Department. The opinion, by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, largely rejected concerns by nine states that the sanctions were too lenient. The settlement, in part, gave computer makers greater freedom to feature rival software on their machines and required Microsoft to disclose some technical data to software developers. The nine states had wanted much more, notably a requirement that Microsoft untie its Windows operating software -- essentially allow PC makers and users to remove some Microsoft features from Windows. The states also wanted Microsoft to allow some of its other software to be translated to rival operating systems.
11/2/2002	JUDGE BACKS TERMS OF U.S. SETTLEMENT IN MICROSOFT CASE	In a hard-fought victory for Microsoft, a federal judge yesterday approved the company's antitrust settlement with the Justice Department and rejected virtually all of the stiffer sanctions sought by a coalition of state attorneys general. The ruling brought at least a temporary close to the landmark case filed nearly five years ago. ''While putting new responsibilities on Microsoft, this settlement also gives us the freedom to keep innovating for our customers,'' Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, said at a news conference at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. ''We're pleased to put another step of this case behind us.''
11/1/2002	Ruling Scheduled In Microsoft Case	The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft antitrust case will issue her decision this afternoon, determining whether to impose sanctions on the company beyond the proposed settlement reached last year by Microsoft and the Justice Department. The decision by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington will state whether Microsoft's business practices will be governed by the proposed settlement or the more severe restrictions proposed by nine states who refused to sign onto the settlement.
11/1/2002	The Pinch of Piracy Wakes China Up On Copyright Issue; It's More Than a Trade Dispute When the Victims Are Chinese	When the members of the preview audience showed up at China's fanciest new movie theater here this week, they were treated to much more than just the first look at Zhang Yimou's big-budget martial-arts film, ''Hero.'' Viewers had identity card numbers inscribed on their tickets. They were videotaped as they entered the theater's foyer. They handed over all cellphones, watches, lighters, car keys, necklaces and pens and put them in storage. Before taking their seats, they passed through a metal detector. Then they got a welcoming address.
10/31/2002	From Inside, Palm Makes A New Start	THERE may come a time in every corporation's life when it must stand tall, swallow hard and abandon the very technology that made it successful. Hewlett-Packard sold off its scientific-instruments division. Apple jettisoned an aging Mac operating system and conceived a new one. DOS is no longer the heart of Microsoft Windows. In Silicon Valley, you could get rich selling ''If you love something, let it go'' T-shirts. The most recent company to start fresh is Palm. Palm's organizers dominate the consumer market -- but where there's money to be made, there's Microsoft, whose Pocket PC palmtops have recently gained some popularity in corporations. These more expensive hand-helds lure executives with voice recorders, high-resolution screens, fast processors and other goodies.
10/31/2002	A Versatile Organizer Is All Windows at Heart	The appearance of ViewSonic's new V35 Pocket PC tomorrow will be news not just for hand-held fanatics but for the software business too. With the V35, ViewSonic becomes the 29th company to produce an organizer with an operating system from Microsoft rather than Palm. The V35, priced at $299, is among the least expensive, thinnest and lightest (at four ounces) hand-held organizers in its class. It is powerful enough to store pictures and MP3's comfortably, play videos and feature a built-in voice recorder.
10/31/2002	Upgrading to Windows XP	To the Editor: Re ''Bugs and Dust Balls: A 'Clean' Installation'' (Basics, Oct. 24): I, too, was faced with the degradingly poor performance of Windows 98 on my machine and took a dive to fix the problem. However, I chose to partition my hard drive and install SuSe 8.1, a Linux distribution, rather than pay for Windows XP. Am I glad. SuSe 8.1 was installed, recognized mouse, scanner and CD/RW, and autoconnected to cable -- all in 30 minutes. And yes, I can access and work with files from Windows. I can do anything Windows can do to boot -- and SuSe does it faster. GORDON MILLS Austin, Tex.
10/29/2002	This Space Underfoot? Not for Sale	BILL GATES is only part of the problem. We're not talking here about antitrust lawsuits or massive imbalances of wealth in America. Those may be important matters but they are small potatoes compared with the issue of the hour in New York: how to get businesses, large and small, to stop treating the city's streets as if they were a giant billboard begging to be filled with corporate graffiti.
10/27/2002	Private Sector; A New Pursuit, Perhaps Trivial, For a Veteran of Microsoft	The ''aha'' moment came at a barbecue earlier this year, recalled Brad Chase, when the conversation took an etymological turn. Someone asked where terms like ''red-letter day'' came from. A good question, thought Mr. Chase, who likes to play with words. So he decided to create a board game, called Derivation, in which players answer questions about the origins of words, names and phrases. Mr. Chase, 42, a wealthy former Microsoft executive who led the marketing campaign for Windows 95, certainly had the means to pursue almost any interest.
10/26/2002	Scolded, Microsoft Takes Blame For Swarms of Butterfly Decals	The New York City Transportation Department has done in a day what the United States Justice Department could not do for years: made Microsoft say it's sorry. The corporation accepted the blame yesterday for hundreds of plastic butterfly decals that were affixed across the face of Midtown Manhattan as part of a $300 million promotional campaign for its new MSN 8 Internet service.
10/25/2002	City Officials Tell Microsoft to Get Its Butterfly Decals Out of Town	Two days after city inspectors ripped up illegal Nike advertising decals glued to sidewalks along Central Park West, Microsoft unleashed a swarm of large adhesive butterflies in Manhattan. They settled yesterday morning on sidewalks and doorways; traffic signals, stop signs and planters. They alighted on the bluestone paving around Grand Army Plaza and the granite corners around Grand Central Terminal.
10/25/2002	Disney to Offer New Internet Access Service	The Walt Disney Company will introduce a new dial-up Internet access service aimed at families with children that is a customized version of Microsoft's MSN. Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chief executive, announced the new service in a surprise appearance on a stage set up by Microsoft in Central Park yesterday to start a $300 million marketing blitz for the next version of MSN. Microsoft is taking aim at AOL Time Warner's America Online service, and an association with Mickey Mouse, the Lion King and Winnie the Pooh is meant to appeal to AOL's mainstream audience.
10/25/2002	Corporate Advertising on the Fly	IF you want to upgrade your computer's memory and operating system and you are doing it yourself, you will need a telephone, a vacuum cleaner and superhuman patience. The rest depends on your computer's configuration. (More on the required items in a moment.) Recently my home PC began showing signs of age. A Dell Dimension with a Pentium III chip and a 450-megahertz processor, it was zippy when I bought it in 1999.
10/24/2002	Bugs and Dust Balls: A 'Clean' Installation	Microsoft and Orange S.A., the mobile unit of France Télécom, will begin selling a wireless phone Oct. 28 in Britain with the ability to store address books, music and calendars and view e-mail messages. The phone is the first using Microsoft's Smartphone software, which is based on the Windows operating system. Orange will charge ?179 ($276) with a one-year wireless service contract for the S.P.V. phone, which stands for sound pictures video, said Ed Suwanjindar, a product manager for Microsoft. Microsoft, competing with the top cellphone maker Nokia, is trying to sell more software for running wireless phones as part of a campaign to increase sales by marketing versions of Windows for devices other than personal computers. Orange, which had 41.4 million customers in 20 countries as of June 30, is trying to increase revenue by selling new wireless data services.
10/23/2002	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Microsoft And Orange To Sell Organizer	Electronic Arts is a Silicon Valley company markedly out of step with its neighbors. In this region, where the market values of many technology companies have shriveled the last two years, Electronic Arts, the world's biggest video-game publisher, has flourished. On Friday, its shares closed at $70.14, its highest finish since the company went public 13 years ago, and up 13 percent for the year.
10/21/2002	Market Place; For Big Game Maker, Online Play Is a Big Gamble	An article in Business Day on Thursday about Microsoft's pricing practices misspelled the name of the chief information officer of Creative Artists Agency, who predicted that the licensing structure would cut his firm's software costs by 20 percent. He is Michael Keithley, not Keathley.
10/18/2002	Microsoft Reports Strong Revenue and Net Income Even Though the Economy Was Weak	Microsoft reported a remarkably strong quarterly performance yesterday with both profits and revenue up sharply at a time when the economy is weak and technology spending is depressed. Microsoft did get an unusual increase in revenue in the quarter, largely from corporate customers rushing to sign up for a new licensing program before a July deadline.
10/17/2002	Bluetooth, Do You Read Me? Wireless Typing and Clicking	Microsoft's Wireless Optical Desktop for Bluetooth is not just another wireless computer keyboard and mouse. It is the first to rely on the Bluetooth protocol to connect components wirelessly. The keyboard and mouse come with a 1.1 Bluetooth transceiver, a thumb-size sliver of plastic tipped with a flashing blue light. When placed in a small cradle connected to a computer's U.S.B. port, the transceiver searches for compatible Bluetooth-enabled devices within a 30-foot radius. A notebook adapter, also included, eliminates the need for the cradle.
10/17/2002	Some Yelp as Microsoft Squeezes	Microsoft's plan to impose a new pricing program has been prompting a chorus of complaints from corporate and government customers for several months. But early results, analysts say, indicate that the move was shrewd financially -- at least in the short run. The new plan, according to Microsoft, is intended to simplify a pricing system for corporate and government customers that had grown complicated and confusing over the years. It moves customers to a subscription model of paying yearly fees for updated software, instead of deciding each time whether to buy a new version of Windows, Office or other Microsoft programs.
10/16/2002	AOL Says It Will Eliminate Some of Its Pop-Up Ads	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that its AOL service would eliminate pop-up advertisements for other companies as it sought to revive the allegiance of its members, reinvent its fading advertising business, and fend off an assault from Microsoft's MSN service. An AOL spokesman said the policy would end more than half of its pop-up ads, including those for sales of merchandise. The company will continue running those advertisements until it fulfills certain contractual commitments. AOL will also still run some pop-up advertisements for its own services and features, although a spokesman said it would run fewer of those as well.
10/14/2002	Corrections	An obituary on Sept. 26 about Bob Wallace, a software pioneer who was an early Microsoft employee, referred incorrectly to the file retrieval and editing system, or Fress, a 1960's software development project at Brown University in which he was involved. The software researcher Ted Nelson, who coined the term ''hypertext,'' was not involved in the Fress project, and his coinage predated the Fress effort.
10/14/2002	E-Commerce Report; Complications with cookies arise over privacy policies that don't mesh.	AS more people adopt the latest version of Microsoft's market-dominant Internet Explorer Web browser, its privacy features are creating unintended consequences for users, information publishers and advertisers. Users of the software get more privacy protection than they once did. But on many Web sites they are also getting more pop-up ads and less personalized service than in the past, according to industry executives and analysts.
10/10/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Executive Faults Licensing Plan	Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, said yesterday that his company made mistakes when it moved to a new licensing plan this year that angered customers, some of whom had to pay more. ''With 20-20 hindsight, I probably wouldn't have made any of these changes when the economy was going to go south,'' Mr. Ballmer said in an interview at a conference sponsored by the market researcher Gartner Inc. in Orlando, Fla. Microsoft switched to the new plan Aug. 1 to try to make its software licensing programs easier to understand and cheaper for some customers. The plan requires clients to buy maintenance contracts, which cost at least 25 percent more than the software alone, or to pay more for upgrades to new programs. Analysts have estimated that most customers will end up paying more, and some clients have said they are looking at competing programs.
10/10/2002	Changing Channels, On the PC	AMONG the members of the Society of Working Americans Resenting Microsoft (Swarm), the chief gripe is that Microsoft has gotten obscenely rich by exploiting the innovations of others. Such people grumble that Microsoft rarely breaks new ground on its own. But a funny thing happened on the way to the recession: PC sales began to decline, and Microsoft set out to conquer new realms, like phones, game consoles and home-entertainment systems. Microsoft is hedging its bets -- and doing some interesting new thinking in the process.
10/9/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Sell New Office Software	Microsoft, which is trying to reverse slowing growth in its Office suite of software, will announce a new Office program today that makes it easier for employees to add data into corporate programs and databases. The program, code-named XDocs, will be available in the middle of next year, said Scott Bishop, a Microsoft Office product manager. Microsoft's sales of Office and other desktop applications increased less than 1 percent, to $9.6 billion, in the 12 months ended June 30. XDocs will let companies create electronic forms that workers can fill out to add or update information automatically in various programs and databases and to circulate that data to co-workers. The software makes it easier to collect and share information with greater accuracy, Microsoft said.
10/7/2002	Compressed Data; Dueling 8.0's: America Online vs. Microsoft	So let's see who has the most star power -- Alanis Morissette or Bill Gates. Next week in Manhattan, on Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Morissette is among those who will help Stephen M. Case, chairman of AOL Time Warner, celebrate the rollout of version 8.0 of America Online's software with a show at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. (Ms. Morissette, not coincidentally, is a pop artist for AOL's corporate cousin, Warner Music.) The audience will include about 2,000 AOL subscribers, some of whom will be asked to speak about why they still love the service's online community.
10/6/2002	Playground Of Billionaires	It is the end of a long day of racing in the Hauraki Gulf, and America's Cup racing boats are returning to Viaduct Harbor to be hauled ashore, hosed down and cloaked in skirts, to hide the secrets of speed that lurk below their waterlines. With their blunt bows, blade-like sails and carbon-fiber riggings tuned as precisely as a harp, the boats are among the most technologically advanced in the world. The boat in the harbor that attracts the most attention, however -- and the one that best captures the spirit of the ongoing America's Cup challenge, the Louis Vuitton Cup -- does not have sails or a team of grinders whirling away at the winches. It is a gleaming white four-story sea monster with black wraparound glass balconies, a basketball court on the afterdeck and an oversize American flag drooping from the stern. It is Larry Ellison's yacht, the 250-foot Katana. The parking spot alone costs $200,000 a month.
10/3/2002	Microsoft Reports Progress In Averting Computer Crashes	Microsoft today released data about its Watson online error-reporting service, which the company says has had a significant impact on increasing the stability of its software. The company has struggled in recent years to improve its credibility in the face of an industry reputation for error-prone programs.
9/30/2002	Corrections	A picture with the State of the Art column in Circuits on Thursday, about Microsoft's Windows Media Player software, was published in error. It showed Version 7; the review dealt with Version 9.

9/26/2002	Showtime, Microsoft Style	A RECENT visit to Download.com reminded me why the entertainment industry is in such a panic over the Internet. The most popular program on the site's Top 50 list during the week of Sept. 15 was KaZaA Media Desktop, a Napster-like file-sharing program. It was downloaded 2.7 million times. In fact, 13 of the site's 25 most popular items, accounting for 9.7 million downloads, were programs that find, acquire, play or record music and videos from the Internet -- and with one exception, they give nary a nod to copyright protections.
9/26/2002	Bob Wallace, 53, Software Pioneer, Dies	Bob Wallace, a pioneering programmer of the personal computer era who helped invent ''shareware'' software marketing , died on Friday at his home in San Rafael, Calif. He was 53. The cause was not immediately known and the results of an autopsy are not yet available, said his wife, Megan Dana-Wallace.
9/21/2002	Microsoft Buys Stake in Game Developer	The Microsoft Corporation bought a 49 percent stake in the British game-software developer Rare Ltd. from the Nintendo Company, the maker of the GameCube video-game system, a Nintendo vice president said today. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate marketing, declined to comment on the terms of the deal.
9/20/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Microsoft Enters Wireless Home Networking	Hopping on the bandwagon for wireless home networking products, Microsoft announced 10 new products yesterday. The products, which include wireless base stations and Ethernet adapters, will be available in the next few weeks for $29.95 to $219.95. Smaller companies like NetGear, D-Link, Linksys and SMC now dominate wireless home networking. Microsoft, however, said that its products would be easier to use. ''The process of setting up a wireless network has simply been too complex for the people looking to share their broadband Internet connection,'' said Lisa Brummel, vice president for the company's home products division. Microsoft's track record selling consumer electronics, however, is decidedly mixed. Earlier offerings of a 900MHz cordless phone and USB speakers failed to find many buyers. Shares in Microsoft closed the day at $ 47.20, down 55 cents, or 1.15 percent. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
9/20/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: J. D. Edwards To Use I.B.M. Database In Package	J. D. Edwards & Company plans to sell a package of business programs that includes database software from I.B.M., a blow to other database vendors like Oracle and Microsoft. J. D. Edwards, whose software manages inventory, accounting and customer relations, will sell the package to midmarket customers, which J. D. Edwards defines as having annual sales of $250 million to $3 billion, said Lenley Hensarling, the company's vice president for product management. The announcement expands the alliance between I.B.M. and J. D. Edwards, under which they make sure their programs work together and recommend each other's software.
9/18/2002	Sun Is Ready To Push Linux As Alternative To Microsoft	Sun Microsystems plans to throw its weight behind the ''open source'' software movement on Wednesday as part of an industry effort to offer an alternative to Microsoft's Windows and Office programs. Sun's challenge, based on the Linux alternative to Windows-based software, is a daunting one, according to industry analysts, because Microsoft's Office suite of word-processing, spreadsheet and other software applications is pervasive in the corporate computing world.
9/18/2002	The New Challenge to Microsoft	As the government's antitrust lawsuit winds down, Microsoft's next battle may be a knock-down, drag-out fight against Linux. Like Microsoft's Windows, Linux is a computer operating system, but written and updated by volunteer programmers in a communitarian spirit, and available for free. If Linux spreads, Microsoft could see the first real challenge to its dominance of the operating-system software market. For consumers, that would be good news. Microsoft's critics charge that its dominance of the market -- more than 90 percent of home computers run on its software -- results in high prices and reduced choice. And outside programmers have long complained that Microsoft makes it hard for them to create software compatible with Windows-based computers.
9/17/2002	A Microsoft Pioneer Leaves to Strike Out on His Own	Charles Simonyi, a computer scientist who joined Microsoft when it had 40 employees and who helped set its technical strategy for years, is leaving the company to found his own software start-up. Mr. Simonyi's departure, to be announced today, will leave Microsoft with only three senior people from the team that led the company in the early 1980's: Bill Gates, a co-founder and the company's chairman; Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive; and Jeffrey S. Raikes, a group vice president.
9/12/2002	Project Seeks to Link Commercial Software and Realm of the Free	HISTORY is rife with unlikely pairs: van Gogh and Gauguin. Felix and Oscar. Lyle and Julia. But Tux, the jolly black-and-yellow Linux penguin, and Bill Gates? Indeed, the unthinkable has happened: an informal partnership between a Microsoft project called .Net and an ordinarily Microsoft-bashing camp of programmers who have set out to produce a free twin of the .Net framework, a set of programming tools. The effort, called Mono, is a rare bridging of the chasm between the commercial world and free software, a movement in which the Linux operating system is at the forefront.
9/12/2002	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Dispute Continues	The Nvidia Corporation, the sole supplier of graphics chips for Microsoft's Xbox video-game console, must keep selling processors to Microsoft as the companies try to settle a pricing dispute, an arbitration panel ruled. In an interim ruling, the panel said Nvidia must supply Microsoft's ''reasonable requirements of chipsets,'' without specifying the exact quantities, according to a Nvidia filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nvidia expects the arbitration to be finished by the end of June. The ruling will remain in effect until the dispute is resolved. Microsoft contends that it should have paid at least $46 million less than it has for chips used to generate graphics in the Xbox, the filing said. In April, Microsoft asked an arbitration panel to order Nvidia to cut prices and to supply as many chips as necessary. Microsoft has been trying to save money on Xbox parts to lower the cost of the machine, which sells for $199 in the United States, less than it costs to produce. David Hufford, the product manager for Xbox, has said Microsoft will not replace Nvidia as a supplier because the processors were designed specifically for Xbox.
9/11/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Acquires XDegrees	Microsoft plans to acquire XDegrees as part of an effort to improve the ability of its Windows operating system to store corporate data. The terms were not disclosed. XDegrees, based in Mountain View, Calif., makes software for securely viewing information stored on corporate networks. Microsoft has been working to improve the ability of Windows to protect data that is shared across a network. The company has said it plans to complete work on a new version of Windows for server computers, used to anchor networks, later this year. It will probably go on sale early next year.
9/9/2002	Browser Battle Winds Down	The formerly heated battle between Web browser software made by Microsoft and Netscape has all but ended in an overwhelming victory for Microsoft. Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is now used by 96 percent of Web surfers worldwide, compared with only a 3 percent market share for Netscape, according to statistics gathered by StatMarket, a division of the audience measurement company WebSideStory.
9/7/2002	MICROSOFT FORGIVES LOAN TO FORMER PRESIDENT	Microsoft, which has more than $38 billion in cash and short-term investments, forgave a loan of $15 million plus interest to its former president, Richard Belluzzo, after he quit in May, a filing shows. Microsoft lent the money as an advance on the value of stock options that Mr. Belluzzo received, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows. Mr. Belluzzo did not repay any of the loan, a spokeswoman for Microsoft said. Mr. Belluzzo agreed to the cancellation of 3.5 million shares in options grants made in 1999 and 2000. All of those options have no current value after a 31 percent drop in Microsoft's stock since the end of 1998. Mr. Belluzzo stepped down May 1 after one year as president.

9/5/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: New Version Of Windows Media Introduced	Microsoft released a new version of its Windows Media software with a party in Los Angeles that underscored how important Hollywood's adoption of the technology is to the company. The announcement comes on the heels of the latest release of audio and video player software by Microsoft's main competitor in this area, Real Networks. Unlike the Real Networks player, which plays back all of the major audio and video formats, Windows Media 9 will not play material encoded in the Real Networks format. But Microsoft said the new platform would allow streaming video on the personal computer to look as good as if it were on television and enable providers of digital media to secure their material. The new software platform will also allow content providers to encode high-quality 5.1 channel surround sound for streaming audio and high-definition video with file sizes as small as half of those of DVD's, Microsoft said. Amy Harmon (NYT)
9/5/2002	An Alternative To Microsoft Gains Support In High Places	Governments around the world, afraid that Microsoft has become too powerful in critical software markets, have begun working to ensure an alternative. More than two dozen countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America, including China and Germany, are now encouraging their government agencies to use ''open source'' software -- developed by communities of programmers who distribute the code without charge and donate their labor to cooperatively debug, modify and otherwise improve the software.
8/30/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Says Windows Has Security Flaw	Microsoft said yesterday that all versions of the Windows operating system released since 1996 have a serious security flaw that could prevent users from being able to encrypt e-mail and use some Web sites. In a bulletin sent by e-mail, the company, the world's largest software maker, called the vulnerability ''critical,'' its most serious rating for flaws. The company encouraged users to download a software patch to correct the problem immediately. Microsoft is working to improve the security of its software after holes allowed worms and viruses to enter Microsoft programs, angering customers. Last January, Bill Gates, the company chairman, ordered workers to focus on security, and the company halted work on some products for two months to retrain engineers. The flaw could allow a hacker to delete so-called digital certificates from a user's system. These certificates are used to hold codes that let users encrypt and decrypt e-mails and view secure Web pages like electronic commerce sites. The hacker would not be able to steal the code.
8/28/2002	Sony to Offer PlayStation Games Online	The battle for dominance in the multibillion-dollar video game industry flared yesterday as Sony Computer Entertainment America announced that its PlayStation 2 game console, the market leader, can now play selected games over the Internet. Sony also kept an earlier promise that it would not charge a fee to play its popular games online. The Microsoft Corporation, which entered the highly competitive video game arena last November with its moderately successful Xbox console, says that it will start an online gaming service, Xbox Live, on Nov. 15. The service is expected to be fee-based and sold through retail outlets in a $49.95 kit, which is to include a headset and one-year subscription.
8/28/2002	Windows XP Update Is Set As a Part Of U.S. Deal	In an effort to comply with the terms of an antitrust consent decree agreement with the Justice Department, Microsoft said today that it planned to distribute its first major update to the Windows XP operating system some time in the next 10 days. The company will make a slight change in the desktop appearance of Windows XP, which was introduced last October. A new feature will enable computer manufacturers to selectively hide and display Microsoft's integrated programs displayed on the start menu of the operating system, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, Windows Media Player and Windows Messenger programs.
8/23/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Focus Enhancements Chip Accepted For Xbox	Focus Enhancements said Microsoft had accepted its FS454 semiconductor chip for use in the Xbox video game console. The share price jumped as much as 65 percent and ended the day up 37 cents, or 28 percent, at $1.70. Earlier the shares had reached $2.20. They have risen 27 percent in the last year. Focus Enhancements, which is based in Campbell, Calif., and Microsoft began working together in May 2001 to develop a low-cost video chip that would improve the look of Xbox video games on television screens and still fit into the existing game console design, Focus Enhancements said in a statement. The chip converts signals from the Xbox console for playback on standard and high-definition television sets, a Focus Enhancements spokesman, Steve Sheldon, said. The FS454 chip will help Microsoft cut costs for components and make the unprofitable Xbox system more competitive in the video game market. Analysts estimate that Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is losing $50 to $150 on each Xbox console sold. Focus Enhancements expects to receive orders from Microsoft shortly, said Sean Leous, an outside spokesman for the company.
8/23/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Novell Reports Profit As Sales Rise 13%	Novell, whose NetWare software competes with Microsoft's Windows operating system, posted a fiscal third-quarter profit of $9.9 million yesterday, bolstered by a 13 percent sales increase and lower expenses. Net income for the quarter ended July 31 was 3 cents a diluted share, in contrast to a net loss of $19.3 million, or 6 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $282.3 million from $249.1 million, and operating expenses declined 20 percent. Novell has been expanding into new products after losing market share to Microsoft in operating system software. Last month, Novell bought SilverStream Software to add programs used to run Web applications. Demand for Novell's programs was stronger than expected in Europe and remained sluggish in the United States, the chief financial officer, Ron Foster, said. ''In the software world, the continuing reports are that the information-technology marketplace isn't rebounding,'' Mr. Foster said. ''The consulting business globally and notably in the U.S. has still not completely leveled out.'' Novell shares, which have dropped 54 percent this year, climbed as high as $2.78 after the news was announced. But by the close of regular trading they had fallen 9 cents, to $2.09. Excluding purchased in-process research and development, Novell said it would have earned 4 cents a diluted share in the recent period. On that basis, which does not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, Novell had been expected to earn 2 cents, the average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Excluding certain items, fourth-quarter profit will be less than in the third quarter because of costs from the SilverStream purchase, Mr. Foster said. Sales will be about $10 million more than in the third quarter, the company said.
8/22/2002	Software Buyers Find Support Has Its Price	FOR 14 years, computer users who bought software by Dantz, a manufacturer of backup programs, received unlimited free technical support by phone or by e-mail. No longer. Earlier this year, Dantz began restricting its free assistance to just 30 days after purchase. Customers who buy an upgrade of a Dantz program get no free help at all. Depending on the product, both types of customers will have to pay either $39.95 or $69.95 per incident to talk to someone who can help solve their problem. Consumers had better get used to it. As more and more features are tacked onto software programs, other fundamentals are falling by the wayside. Printed manuals? These days they are a rarity. Free phone and e-mail support? Maybe, but don't hold your breath -- and keep a credit card handy, because paid-help plans are spreading like a virus.
8/21/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: New Digital Media Player Software	RealNetworks began offering new digital media player software yesterday that plays music and video in all formats, including that of Microsoft, its main competitor. The software is available for $19.95 or as part of a monthly fee for one of RealNetworks' subscription services. The move continues a shift in the company's strategy, first signaled last month, when it said it would allow companies that use its software to broadcast programs over the Internet to use audio and video in a range of formats, including Microsoft's proprietary Windows Media. ''Sometimes just because your competitor wants you to do something doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,'' said Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks. ''We realized we were the only ones who could offer universal playback, and we thought consumers would really appreciate it.'' RealNetworks has come under increasing pressure from Microsoft, which gives away both its media player and server software as part of the Windows operating system. Microsoft is expected to introduce the latest version of its own digital media player software next month. Amy Harmon (NYT)
8/19/2002	Compressed Data; Out-of-It Eyebrow Lift Gives Apple a Superstar	Apple Computer has a hit on its hands. Not its elegant iMac desktop machines or the lustworthy iPod music player -- those are old news. This hit is a television ad featuring a slow-talking, engaging teenager, Ellen Feiss, who describes her decision to use Macintosh computers after a Windows PC ate her homework. ''It was, like, beep beep beep beep beep beep beep,'' she says, ''and then, like, half of my paper was gone.'' She characterizes the experience, over all, as a ''bummer.''
8/10/2002	Microsoft and Free Software At the Same Show? It's True	Peter Houston, a top software executive at Microsoft, is not planning to wear a flak vest as he plays host when the company has its first booth ever at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo computer industry show that opens here on Monday. But the Microsoft appearance might be construed as an olive branch, for the company is widely considered an enemy of the freely distributed Linux operating system and a pariah within the anarchic free-software movement. In addition, Microsoft executives have frequently attacked the idea of sharing rather than buying software.
8/9/2002	Settling With F.T.C., Microsoft Agrees to Privacy Safeguards	Settling charges brought by the Federal Trade Commission, Microsoft acknowledged yesterday that it had not properly protected the privacy and security of people who provided personal information through the company's online identification services. The company agreed to shore up the security of its system, known as Passport, as well as to be more truthful with users about what it does with their personal data, and to obtain an outside audit of its practices every two years.
8/7/2002	Microsoft Faces Old Foe In New Role: Chancellor	In March 1998, with the Justice Department threatening the biggest antitrust suit of the century against Microsoft, the company's chairman, Bill Gates, made a visit to a New York City middle school. Accompanied by a gaggle of reporters and photographers to Mott Hall School in Washington Heights, Mr. Gates used the opportunity to burnish his battered image while drawing attention to a laptop-computer leasing program that Microsoft helped finance. Now that Joel I. Klein, the man who led the prosecution of Microsoft, has been named schools chancellor, Mr. Gates may choose to look elsewhere the next time he needs a public relations refuge.
8/6/2002	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Investment In Cornell Center Increased	Dell Computer, Intel and Microsoft will add $60 million to their investment in a Cornell University center that will promote the companies' chips, software and hardware for supercomputers. Cornell's not-for-profit Cornell Theory Center, which already receives free products from the companies, will double the size of an existing Cornell supercomputer and add five staff members to help promote the companies' wares as it consults with business, government and academic clients, a Cornell spokeswoman, Margaret Corbit, said yesterday. The $60 million in added resources will be spread over four years. The companies say they gain research expertise and a partner close to New York-based customers. Cornell sells advice to its clients on how to use the companies' products to solve specific problems, Ms. Corbit said. Cornell will showcase its systems in the financial district of Manhattan. Cornell's 50-employee center, based in Ithaca, N.Y., provides computing resources for basic research at the university, including studies of materials, proteins and engineering problems, the center's director, Tom Coleman, said on a conference call.
8/6/2002	Microsoft Promises More Disclosures	Microsoft will disclose more technical information than it ever has before about its Windows operating system to comply with the proposed antitrust settlement it reached last fall with the Justice Department, the company said yesterday. The move comes as a federal district judge is determining whether the agreement is far-reaching enough to account for the damage done by Microsoft's repeated violation of antitrust laws, and to ensure that the company does not repeat its behavior.
8/1/2002	Televisions That Reduce Cable Clutter for Xbox Aficionados	A new line of televisions from RCA may help game players reduce the snarl of dusty wires behind the set. These 11 new models have a special connection, the RCA VPort, that allows Microsoft Xbox owners to plug in with a single cable rather than three. Jeff DeClue, a product planning manager for RCA, said that the specialized port improves game image quality, particularly by reducing ''dot crawling,'' the shimmer that often surrounds stationary text when it appears on a television screen.
8/1/2002	Microsoft Word Formats Brought Into Full View	Some law firms and other heavy users of formatting commands in word processing documents have stuck with Corel's WordPerfect for a single reason. Unlike Microsoft's ubiquitous Word software, WordPerfect can display all of the formatting commands within a document. In Word 2002, Microsoft introduced a feature that offers a limited glimpse of formatting commands to help users who can't figure out why a typeface or other feature looks odd. People who want or need to see everything might consider CrossEyes, an add-on for Word from Levit & James, a software maker in Leesburg, Va.
8/1/2002	Handwriting: Is It on the Wall?	FOR Steven Storch, a New York lawyer, the process was gradual but the realization sudden: his handwriting had devolved into an illegible scrawl of hurried, inky scribbles. Mr. Storch, 52, does not blame the digits on his writing hand, but rather the pervasive digital technology in his office and home. For most of his life he had jotted notes and thrashed out ideas with a pen and a yellow pad, but over the last eight years he has typed almost everything into computers. These days, he said, ''the only writing I do is to sign a check and put my signature on a letter.''
7/31/2002	Microsoft Seen In Wireless Deal	Microsoft plans to announce a partnership today with AT&T Wireless Services to offer wireless software and services, a person close to the talks said last night. The deal would be part of Microsoft's drive to sign up wireless carriers to use its so-called smart phone software -- a pared-down version of the Windows operating system -- and services that Microsoft is developing as part of its .Net Internet strategy.
7/30/2002	BLOOMBERG PICKS A LAWYER TO RUN NEW YORK SCHOOLS	Joel I. Klein, a publishing executive and a lawyer best known for leading the antitrust prosecution of Microsoft, was appointed yesterday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as the first chancellor of the reconfigured New York public school system. In announcing his choice for chancellor before his top staff members in the historic Tweed Courthouse, Mr. Bloomberg has put in the final piece of a series of historic changes intended to bring greater accountability for the education of 1.1 million New York City children; accountability, he has promised, that rests with him.
7/26/2002	Microsoft to Step Up Spending and Hiring	Shrugging off a deep recession in the technology industry that has beset its competitors, Microsoft said today that it planned to accelerate its investment in research and development and increase its work force. At a daylong meeting for financial analysts, Bill Gates, the chairman and chief software architect, said that Microsoft would increase its investment in new software and hardware technologies almost 20 percent in the fiscal year 2003, raising its spending to $5.2 billion, from $4.3 billion. At the same time, the company plans to add 5,000 workers to its force of 50,000. In its last fiscal year, it added almost 3,000.
7/25/2002	Sports Fantasy Is Catching Up With Reality	''THE sun is setting,'' the announcer said, ''but we're just getting started.'' It's time for N.F.L. football at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla., and the bleachers are throbbing with fans. As the palm trees sway in the breeze, players for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Miami Dolphins gather at the 50-yard line for the coin toss. The competition is real, but the game -- not quite. The action unfolding on the television screen is a complex illusion, a multimillion-dollar collaboration between science and industry that produced the video game NFL 2K3, to be released this summer by Sega.
7/25/2002	Microsoft Tries to Explain What Its .Net Plans Are About	Two years into its quest to create a new kind of Internet-enabled computing it describes as .Net, Microsoft found it necessary to pause today and try to explain what it meant. One day before its annual conference for financial analysts, the company assembled its top executives before several hundred reporters and industry analysts and engaged in a tutorial that one participant referred to as ''.Net for Dummies.''
7/25/2002	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday about a new version of software from RealNetworks that can play audio and video in several formats misidentified the Microsoft software whose transmission data RealNetworks monitored in developing its version. It was Microsoft Media Server, not Media Player.
7/25/2002	Video for Those Who Chat Using 2 Messaging Programs	Until recently, only people with Yahoo's instant messaging service or Windows XP users with MSN Messenger could add live video to their online chats, essentially turning them into videophone conference calls. This week, however, the Web-camera maker Logitech released free software that extends that ability to people who favor America Online's Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger users without Windows XP. Historically, variations on videophones have not been embraced by consumers. But Jeff Kletsky, a senior product manager at Logitech, said adding video would be attractive to many instant-messaging users. ''For family and friends that are in different states or countries, this is a good way to stay in touch,'' he said.
7/22/2002	RealNetworks Poses Challenge to Microsoft	In a significant challenge to Microsoft, RealNetworks plans to announce a new version of its software on Monday that can distribute audio and video in a range of formats, including Microsoft's own proprietary Windows Media. The new software is intended for large media companies and other corporations that need to send audio and video data to customers and employees in a variety of different formats. But RealNetworks acknowledged that it was possible that the company might incur Microsoft's legal wrath.
7/21/2002	Corporate Values Trickle Down From the Top	To: Mr. Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft Re: Your e-mail memo, ''Realizing Potential,'' sent to employees last month I recently read your message to the 50,000 employees of Microsoft worldwide. What caught my eye was how much your message, at 2,674 words, noted the importance of values throughout the company and how you said those values ''must shine through in all our interactions -- in our work groups, across teams, with partners, within our industry, and most of all with customers.''
7/20/2002	Samsung Sings Happy Song As Profit Sets A Record	Technology companies elsewhere may be scrimping and suffering, but in South Korea, the second quarter was bountiful. Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory-chip maker and a major maker of cellphones and other products, reported the biggest quarterly profit in its history today and said the rest of the year looked promising, too. With a net income of 1.92 trillion won ($1.65 billion), Samsung made more in the three months ended June 30 than Microsoft, Intel or I.B.M., a comparison that Samsung executives wore proudly today.
7/19/2002	Microsoft Results Beat Expectations	Buoyed by strong revenue across a range of its businesses, Microsoft reported fourth-quarter financial results today that slightly exceeded analysts' expectations. The company said that despite shrinking personal and corporate computing markets, it had continued to find strength in the sales of the new XP version of its Windows operating system, growth of its Office desktop software business and improved performance of a number of its consumer lines, including its MSN online service.
7/18/2002	With Upgrade To Software, MSN May Nip At AOL's Heels	Microsoft, which has yet to find a formula to compete profitably with America Online in the Internet market, is preparing to roll out this fall a new version of its Internet access software that is meant to exploit the perceived weakness of its rival's parent, AOL Time Warner. The new version of the MSN Explorer software, which connects MSN users to the Internet and enhances some of the features of its Web sites, is intended to match AOL's most popular offerings, like parental controls, and provide a bundle of other Microsoft products, like photo editing service.
7/18/2002	Diamond Icons, Leopard-Skin Frames: Dressing Up Windows XP	Shedding skins -- changing the look and user interface of a software program -- isn't just for multimedia software anymore. SkinStudio XP, a Windows XP version of the WindowBlinds program made by the Stardock Corporation, can change the look of dialog boxes, windows and other visual features of the operating system. One of Windows XP's innovations was a choice of blue, silver or green color schemes to frame its menus and dialog boxes; SkinStudio XP adds the ability to download and create thousands of new schemes and styles to add some personalized visual zing to an otherwise staid Windows XP system. Icons, folders, menu bars, windows and boxes can be mixed and matched from existing collections or created from scratch and substituted for the standard Windows elements.
7/9/2002	Nokia to Join With I.B.M. In 2 Ventures On Software	Nokia and I.B.M. will announce an agreement today to develop software to distribute music and other media securely to cellphones over wireless networks in a effort to broaden the market for wireless services beyond telephone service and simple text messages. The companies are also announcing a licensing deal today in which Nokia's wireless software will be integrated with I.B.M.'s digital media software and will be sold and supported by I.B.M.'s big services unit.
7/2/2002	U.S. Warns Web Sites To Label Sponsorships	The Federal Trade Commission has warned the operators of several major Internet search engines to make it clearer to their users when companies have paid to be included in Web search results. The commission responded last week to a complaint filed a year ago by Commercial Alert, an anti-commercialism group co-founded by Ralph Nader.
7/1/2002	Compressed Data; Microsoft Takes Its Software on a Road Trip	To gauge the importance Microsoft places on its new audio and video software, step into the company's new van. That's the only place it's playing, actually. Before setting out across the country to persuade record labels and movie studios to adopt the Windows Media software, Microsoft decided no mere laptop demonstration would suffice. It needed six-channel surround sound. It needed a 50-inch plasma display.
6/27/2002	Microsoft Agrees to Alter a Special Service for Children	Microsoft said today that it had agreed to make changes in a children's version of its Passport authorization software after an advertising industry watchdog group challenged the service over issues of parental control and privacy. The company, based in Redmond, Wash., has promoted Passport as a convenience feature that would permit computer users to sign on only once to use multiple Web sites and online services.
6/25/2002	It's a Tablet. It's a Notebook. From Microsoft, A New Hybrid.	Microsoft began promoting its Tablet PC nearly two years ago with a clear message and vision: a powerful, pen-based computer unfettered by a keyboard. Bill Gates, the company's chairman, made the rounds of industry events, prototype tablet in hand, extolling the virtues of handwriting and digital ink. But when Microsoft announces in New York today that machines using its Tablet PC software will be introduced on Nov. 7, the emphasis will be on using pen-based features to enhance conventional notebook computers.
6/25/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Adds To Sales Force	Microsoft said it was making the largest addition to its sales force in a decade, hiring 450 people as revenue growth slows. The company is rearranging its sales force into teams to cover 12 industries, including telecommunications, education and health care. Another 115 current workers will join sales, the company said.
6/21/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Burst.com Sues Microsoft	Burst.com, a provider of software for broadcasting audio and video over the Internet, has sued the Microsoft Corporation, accusing it of patent infringement and antitrust violations. Burst.com contended in the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, that Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., used Burst's patented video-on-demand technology and trade secrets in Microsoft's new Corona video product. Burst.com, which is based in Santa Rosa, Calif., said in a statement that Microsoft met with it over a two-year period and negotiated unsuccessfully for the rights to use Burst's technology. Officials for Microsoft and Burst.com could not be reached.
6/21/2002	Microsoft and Verizon in D.S.L. Deal	Verizon Communications said yesterday that it would begin using Microsoft's content, software and marketing support for its high- speed D.S.L. Internet service and would pay Microsoft a portion of the revenue. As for Microsoft, it said yesterday that it now offered a D.S.L. version of its MSN online service in 70 markets nationwide, representing 90 percent of the households that can get D.S.L. service. Until yesterday, MSN was available in only 33 markets, primarily in the Western states served by the local phone unit of Qwest Communications. Now, MSN is buying wholesale D.S.L. access from BellSouth, SBC Communications and Verizon and reselling them with MSN content and software.
6/20/2002	Microsoft Antitrust Case Goes to Judge for Ruling	Microsoft and a coalition of state attorneys general pursuing antitrust sanctions against the company disregarded a federal judge's order to identify areas of compromise in their closing arguments today, reiterating instead their widely divergent views of the kind of restrictions she should impose. The day was a milestone in the four-year-old case, often described as a landmark test of whether the antitrust laws of an industrial era can effectively protect competition in the fast-mutating world of high technology. Microsoft was held liable for violating antitrust laws by an appeals court last year, but the ultimate result of that decision lies with Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court.
6/20/2002	Office Turf: No. 1 Faces An Upstart	MICROSOFT once ran a great ad for Office, its business-software cash cow. It went something like this: ''Over 94 percent of the business world uses Microsoft Office. What are we doing wrong?'' It was true: the programs of Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook) seemed as permanent in our lives as the sun, the moon and Windows error messages. Its rivals -- I.B.M.'s Lotus suite and Corel's WordPerfect suite, for example -- were pretty much the same thing for pretty much the same price, and never posed much of a threat. The world waited for a contender that was so compelling, people might actually consider filing for Microsoft divorce.
6/20/2002	Fears of Misuse of Encryption System Are Voiced	A leading European computer security and privacy advocate is challenging an effort by the American computer industry to create a standard to protect software and digital content, calling the plan a smoke screen by established companies to protect their existing markets. In a paper to be presented at a technical conference in Toulouse, France, on Thursday, Ross Anderson, a University of Cambridge computer scientist, attacks the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance, an organization formed in October 1999 by Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Intel and Microsoft. The companies say their intent is to provide a cryptographic system that would ensure privacy and protect intellectual property.
6/20/2002	A Remote That Makes Things Rote For Presenters	Microsoft PowerPoint, laptop computers and digital projectors have brought corporate presentations into the electronic age. But one ritual from the era of overhead projectors lingers. When presenters need to move on, they often ask an assistant to call up the next slide. Oddly, they do this even though many, if not most, digital projectors have remote controls. Dan Rothman, vice president and general manager of Atek Electronics, contends that a design flaw is to blame. ''The history of the remote control is one of making something for the professional A-V marketplace,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''They are too complicated. People find them intimidating.''
6/19/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: Hong Kong: New Microsoft Offices	The Microsoft Corporation said that it would occupy two floors of Hong Kong's Cyberport, a struggling project that is supposed to create a campuslike setting for information technology businesses. Microsoft will move its local operations in October to two floors of the project, totaling 40,000 square feet of office space. Situated beyond the end of Hong Kong's subway system, Cyberport is a 20-minute taxi ride or a 30-minute bus ride from downtown, and has one-third the rents of downtown because the Hong Kong government and its partner, Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd., have had trouble finding tenants. The project has been controversial because it was awarded to Pacific Century, which is now the city's largest phone company, through a private tender instead of through the land auction system on which Hong Kong usually relies. Keith Bradsher (NYT)
6/19/2002	Microsoft Case Has a Surprise Near Its End	The federal judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial indicated for the first time yesterday that she was questioning the government's proposed settlement, which she could reject if she found that it was not in the public interest. Lawyers for Microsoft and the coalition of states pursuing a more restrictive antitrust remedy are scheduled to make their closing arguments today. But in an unexpected order issued yesterday afternoon, the judge appeared less interested in hearing summaries of the opposing views than in structuring a mediation session.
6/18/2002	Economists Push for Microsoft Penalties	Days before closing arguments are scheduled in the Microsoft antitrust trial, a group of six leading antitrust economists has filed a last-minute brief urging the federal judge presiding over the case to impose tough penalties on the company. The economists, each of whom has served as chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division, argue that a strong judicial directive to restore the competition thwarted by Microsoft's illegal acts is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of antitrust law in an economy increasingly dominated by technology companies.
6/13/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Judge Upholds States In Microsoft Case	A federal judge upheld the right of nine states to pursue antitrust penalties against Microsoft yesterday even though the Justice Department and nine other states have agreed to a proposed settlement. Microsoft had argued that Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington should dismiss the case because the states did not have the authority to ask for restrictions that would apply to the entire nation. The software maker also said that the states had not proved that their citizens were injured by the antitrust violations it had committed. Microsoft underestimated the Court of Appeals, Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her ruling, noting that the higher court had an opportunity to rule on the states' role in the case in its decision last June. Amy Harmon (NYT)
6/11/2002	Final Written Arguments Are Filed in Microsoft Case	Microsoft and the group of states that are suing it each filed their final and most exhaustive written arguments yesterday, outlining why the landmark antitrust case should be resolved in its favor. The documents, each about 500 pages, weave together the points each side scored with witnesses and exhibits in a two-month trial earlier this summer. They are intended to serve as a map for the federal judge who will hear closing arguments next week.
6/10/2002	Apple Ad Campaign Stars Former Microsoft Users	Apple Computer plans to begin a nationwide print and television advertising campaign on Monday focusing on people who have switched to Apple's Macintosh from computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. The series features individuals standing against a white background talking about how they felt after moving away from Windows. The statements are meant to be informal and personal, and one Macintosh convert likens using a Windows-based computer to ''being stuck in a bad relationship.''
6/6/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Set To Introduce New Technology	Microsoft will introduce a new technology today called TrustBridge as part of its revised .Net Web services strategy. Both Microsoft's Passport identity system and its HailStorm consumer services proposal have been criticized by competitors and consumer advocates for their potential threat to privacy and because they were designed to lock customers into Microsoft. More recently, Microsoft has taken a new approach that supports sharing management of identity services among competing companies. The company says the technology will become increasingly useful as users connect from one consumer service to another on the Internet and as business increasingly automates buying and selling operations. John Markoff (NYT)
6/6/2002	From a Slab, Fashioning A Clutch PC	FROM Babylonian cuneiform to the recent crop of failed Internet appliances to Microsoft's grand plan to introduce a customized operating system later this year called Windows XP Tablet PC edition, communicating on a flat slab of material is the Once and Future Thing. Through point-and-click interfaces, voice recognition and pen-based stylus input, computer manufacturers have been trying to free us from the tyranny of the keyboard for years. Even though hand-held organizers have made strong advances in incorporating functional handwriting recognition software into powerful little palmtops, their tiny size remains unsatisfactory for many people. Full-size tablet computers in one form or another have been trying to win hearts for years but have failed to catch on, possibly because of size, weight, technical limitations, feeble operating systems or an unattractiveness that would send even the prop people on ''Space: 1999'' into fits of laughter.
6/4/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Settles S.E.C. Charges	The Microsoft Corporation filed false financial reports stemming from its improper use of as much as $900 million in reserves set aside from revenue from 1995 to 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, settled the reporting, disclosure and bookkeeping charges by agreeing to be subject to stiffer penalties if it commits similar violations in the future, the S.E.C. said in a statement. Microsoft, which was not fined, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. The Microsoft charges followed an increase in S.E.C. scrutiny of financial reporting after Enron's bankruptcy in December.
6/4/2002	Accountability for Accountants	Enron, Tyco, Adelphia, Global Crossing: These days, business news can resemble a financial police blotter. The erosion of credibility of many corporations continues, as the Enron affair has unleashed a rash of allegations of dubious accounting practices, and of market insiders corrupted by conflicts of interest. These revelations of trouble at individual companies will continue to rattle the entire stock market so long as Congress and regulators refuse to shore up safeguards against corporate chicanery. Yesterday Dennis Kozlowski, the beleaguered chief executive of Tyco International, the industrial conglomerate that has been the subject of numerous inquiries into its business practices, resigned in disgrace. Microsoft agreed to alter some of its accounting practices that the Securities and Exchange Commission claimed had been used to massage its profit reports. The software giant's behavior had more to do with its manipulation of the timing of reporting revenues than with any outright fraud.
6/3/2002	Industry Allies Seek to Limit Microsoft Drive Into New Fields	The organization, the Liberty Alliance, was off to a good start, but its image was a bit of a problem. At a meeting last January in Orlando, some members of the alliance, which includes American Express, General Motors and United Airlines, chided the representative from Sun Microsystems for statements portraying the Liberty Alliance as an anti-Microsoft initiative. ''Would any of you be here if it wasn't for Microsoft?'' Jonathan I. Schwartz, the Sun executive, asked in reply.
6/1/2002	MICROSOFT IS CHARGED WITH VIOLATING BOOKKEEPING RULES	The Securities and Exchange Commission has voted to charge Microsoft with violating bookkeeping rules when it held millions of dollars in reserves from 1995 to 1998, an S.E.C. commissioner, Isaac Hunt, said. The bookkeeping charges, approved in a meeting Thursday, will not result in a fine because the violations did not harm investors and because Microsoft cooperated with the inquiry, Mr. Hunt said. He added that without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Microsoft agreed that it would be subject to stiffer sanctions if the company committed similar violations in the future.
5/28/2002	Microsoft Faces European Commission Inquiry on Privacy Concerns	The European Commission has begun an inquiry into Microsoft because of concerns that its .NET Passport system may violate privacy rules. The European Commission said last week that it had concerns about the legality of Microsoft's Passport, which stores identity data on the company's servers so that Internet users do not have to re-enter it as they move among programs and Web sites.
5/27/2002	As Promised, Microsoft to Offer Concealable Icons	After four years of legal battling, the first -- and perhaps only -- visible result of the government's antitrust case against Microsoft will arrive this summer: an update to the Windows XP operating system that lets users hide the computer screen icons of some Microsoft programs. Microsoft agreed to make the changes to its latest version of Windows in the settlement it reached with the Justice Department last fall. The company said it was complying with the settlement now, even though it had not yet been approved by a federal judge. ''This is following the letter and the spirit of the consent decree,'' said Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman.
5/27/2002	New Economy; Game makers explore new entertainment and information services for home video sets.	ARE they video-game consoles or Trojan horses? At the Electronic Entertainment Exposition, which ended in Los Angeles last Friday, the talk was all about gaming. Yet inside Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube lurk powerful computers capable -- in principle at least -- of browsing the Web, recording television shows, sending e-mail messages and generally serving as the hub of the much-ballyhooed ''digital lifestyle.''
5/20/2002	Microsoft's $1 Billion Bet on Xbox Network	It was nearly a decade ago that a young Microsoft programmer named J. Allard sounded the alarm and convinced Bill Gates that the Internet was a threat to the dominance of the Microsoft Windows operating system. On Monday, Microsoft will announce Mr. Allard's next big gamble: an ambitious billion-dollar-plus investment in an online game service to be called Xbox Live.
5/20/2002	Sun Takes On Microsoft's Office Software	Hoping to lure corporate customers who are put off by Microsoft's move to a subscription-based pricing system, Sun Microsystems last week released StarOffice 6.0, the latest version of its business applications software positioned as a lower-cost alternative to Microsoft's widely used Office XP. Sun is using a conventional pricing model, charging corporate customers a one-time fee of $25 to $50 for each user of the new commercial version of StarOffice. The list price for the package is $75.95. Earlier versions had been available free as part of Sun's open software program.
5/19/2002	Mexico Embraces Microsoft, Stirring a Debate	WHEN he was 17, Miguel de Icaza wrote his first computer program on the supercomputers of Mexico's nuclear institute. In college, he developed Ximian Gnome, a desktop program that is a lot like Microsoft Windows but differs in one fundamental way. It is free. Today, at 29, he lives in Boston and is chief technology officer of Ximian Inc., whose software can be freely downloaded from the Internet and is used on millions of desktops worldwide.
5/18/2002	Judge Skeptical of a Microsoft Remedy	The judge overseeing the Microsoft trial appeared highly skeptical today of a proposal made by nine states on how to enforce the tough antitrust restrictions they are seeking. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court said she was concerned that the states' request that she appoint a special master to oversee Microsoft's compliance with the remedies she imposes would not lead to settlements.
5/17/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Strategy Rebuffed	The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft trial appeared unreceptive yesterday to Microsoft's efforts to convince her that nine states have no right to seek antitrust penalties on the company beyond a settlement already reached with the Justice Department. Microsoft argues that California, Iowa and the other states do not have the standing to ask for restrictions that would apply to Microsoft's business practices nationwide. But Federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly noted that the appeals court that upheld Microsoft's antitrust violations last year was well aware that the original suit was brought by the federal government along with a coalition of states. If the court had believed the states lacked standing, she said, the judges ''certainly would have said so.'' The judge's comments suggested she would not dismiss the case on those grounds, but she did ask whether she owed ''some amount of deference'' to the Justice Department's less stringent proposal.

5/16/2002	Electronic Arts in Sony Game Deal	Electronic Arts, the world's largest independent video game publisher, said yesterday that it had struck a deal to provide its games for the Sony Corporation's new online gaming effort. Significantly, officials of Electronic Arts said that although it was also in talks with the Microsoft Corporation on joining a rival online effort, it had reservations about Microsoft's strategy. Negotiations have stalled for so long that Electronic Arts said it would almost certainly have no online games ready for Microsoft's Xbox video game platform this year.
5/16/2002	Judge Quizzes Both Sides On Microsoft	The judge presiding over the remedy hearing in the Microsoft antitrust trial indicated today that she was still considering some of the most controversial elements of the restrictions proposed by a coalition of state prosecutors. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who has been largely inscrutable during the two-month hearing, quizzed lawyers from both sides with a sharpness that demonstrated for perhaps the first time in open court her command of the technical and legal issues in the complex case.
5/15/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Cuts Xbox Price	Escalating the hard-nosed price war in the video game industry, Microsoft is to announce today that it will cut the price of its Xbox console in North America by a third, to $199 from $299. It already costs Microsoft more than $299 to make each Xbox. Yesterday, Microsoft's rival console maker, Sony, cut the price of its PlayStation 2 by $100, to $199. Sony says it expects the PlayStation 2, which has been on the market a year longer than the Xbox and shipped about 10 times as many units, to soon be profitable at the new price. Microsoft had planned to announce a price cut next week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, an annual industry trade show in Los Angeles, but acted instead after Sony's announcement. A third maker of video game consoles, Nintendo, said yesterday that it had no plans to lower the North American price of its $199 GameCube system. Chris Gaither (NYT)
5/14/2002	Sony to Cut PlayStation 2 Price by $100	In a move intended to put the squeeze on its rivals in the video game industry, the Sony Corporation plans to announce on Tuesday that it will cut the price of its popular PlayStation 2 game console in North America by a third. The $100 price drop, to be announced at Sony's investors' conference in Japan, is sure to send shivers down the backs of Microsoft and Nintendo. The PlayStation 2, which plays DVD's as well as games, will sell for $199 -- the same price as Nintendo's GameCube, which does not play DVD's, and $100 less than Microsoft's Xbox.
5/13/2002	After Crash Course, Judge Must Solve Microsoft Case	The last of the witnesses for Microsoft finished testifying on Friday at hearings to determine whether the company should face tougher penalties than those it agreed to in a proposed settlement of the Justice Department's antitrust case. But after eight weeks of hearings, during which nine states seeking tougher remedies presented 15 witnesses and Microsoft called 18, including the company's chairman, Bill Gates, several key questions in the case remain unresolved. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington, who has little background in either technology or antitrust law, has reserved judgment on the fundamental issue of how broad the scope of a remedy should be.
5/10/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Figures Show Playstation's Strength	Sony's video game division said yesterday that it had shipped 30 million PlayStation 2 consoles since the system's introduction in October 2000, highlighting the challenges facing its rivals, Nintendo and Microsoft, in trying to unseat Sony. Nintendo said yesterday that it had shipped 12 million of its GameCube consoles, which cost less and are popular among younger children. The PlayStation 2's installed base is largest in North America, where there are 11.3 million, followed by Japan, with 9.9 million, and Europe, with 8.8 million. Sony has shipped four million PlayStation 2's in the last three months alone, matching Microsoft's most optimistic shipment estimates for its Xbox during the company's entire fiscal year, which ends June 30. The Xbox, which hit the market in November, has sold well in North America but struggled in Europe and especially in Japan. Earlier this week, Microsoft said recent price cuts had lifted Xbox sales in Europe, but it released no sales figures. Chris Gaither (NYT)
5/10/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: XBox Developers Plan Games Venture	Two software programmers who left Microsoft after spearheading the introduction of its Xbox video game console have reunited in a start-up games company. Seamus Blackley and Kevin Bachus plan to introduce today their new venture, the Capital Entertainment Group, which will function much like a Hollywood film producer for early-stage game projects. The company, based in Seattle, is raising more than $40 million from investors like the Durlacher Corporation to finance creative games ''that wouldn't otherwise get made,'' said Mr. Blackley, the company's vice president for development. Capital Entertainment will advise game developers, then seek marketing and distribution contracts with publishers. It will focus on games for the Xbox, he said, but will take on projects for any console or the personal computer. The company plans to announce its first development partnership today, with the publisher Sega of America. Chris Gaither (NYT)
5/10/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: MSN Messenger Flaw Is Identified	Microsoft said a security flaw in some versions of its MSN Messenger program for exchanging messages over the Internet could enable a hacker to take over a user's computer. MSN Messenger had 23.4 million users for September, according to a study by the market research firm Jupiter Media Metrix, making it the No. 2 such program. A similar program that comes installed with Microsoft's newest version of Windows does not have the flaw, according to a Microsoft security alert. A software patch to fix the flaw can be found at www.microsoft.com/downloads.
5/8/2002	Judge Allows States to Present New Evidence Against Microsoft	The federal judge hearing the Microsoft antitrust case said today that she would overlook procedural errors by the states pursuing sanctions against the company and allow them to present new evidence about a restriction they have proposed. Over Microsoft's objections, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court agreed to allow the states to present an expert witness, James Bach, in an attempt to show that the company's Windows operating system can be broken into different components.
5/8/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Acquisition By Microsoft	Microsoft said yesterday that it would acquire Navision, a Danish business-planning software company, for $1.3 billion in cash and stock. Microsoft said the acquisition would bring together the strengths of Navision and Great Plains Business Solutions, an American company that Microsoft bought last year for $1.1 billion. Both companies make software aimed at small and midsize businesses. The deal requires clearance from antitrust authorities and 90 percent acceptance of the offer. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
5/7/2002	Court Is Told Microsoft Kept Strategy Even After Ruling	The Microsoft Corporation bundled more multimedia features into Windows XP even after a judge ruled the company had illegally integrated extra functions into the operating system to protect its monopoly, a company executive testified today. Nine states challenging Microsoft's proposed settlement of the federal government's four-year-old antitrust case suggested that Microsoft had not dropped efforts to squash competition and would not be restrained by the accord.
5/3/2002	States Question Microsoft Motive In Move to Add Media Players	The Microsoft Corporation bundled new-media player features into Windows to counter a ''strategic threat'' from RealNetworks Inc., according to documents produced by nine states seeking antitrust remedies against Microsoft. The states, which are challenging a proposed settlement of the federal government's four-year-old antitrust case against Microsoft, are trying to persuade a federal judge to impose more restraints on Microsoft's ability to use its Windows operating system to crush competitors.
5/2/2002	Threat Is Seen to Microsoft Windows	The Microsoft Corporation's Windows software would collapse like a ''house of cards'' under an antitrust proposal by nine states to strip Internet Explorer from the operating system, a computer scientist testified today. Stuart E. Madnick, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, testified that it would be ''difficult, if not impossible,'' to carry out the states' proposal for a ''modular'' version of Windows that lets computer makers easily remove programs like Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player. The professor likened Windows to a brick wall that would topple without the blocks of computer code that make up the system's Web browser.
5/2/2002	Instead of a Password, Well-Placed Clicks	XY$Z4#T. It is a password only a security expert could love. Most people have trouble remembering random combinations of letters and symbols. So they jot difficult passwords down near their computer or replace them with far simpler combinations, making their systems vulnerable to attack.
5/1/2002	States' Attack On Microsoft May Be Hurt	A federal judge indicated today that she might not allow nine states challenging the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust settlement with the government to introduce evidence that their lawyer has said is a ''central part of our case.'' The states want to introduce documents outlining complaints from computer makers that the proposal to settle the case would let Microsoft continue retaliating against them if they do not give in to its demands, said Howard Gutman, a lawyer for the states. The states are seeking tougher remedies against the world's largest software maker.
4/29/2002	MediaTalk; Slate Picks a Successor to Michael Kinsley	The bake-off for the editorship of Slate, an online magazine owned by Microsoft, has concluded, and Jacob Weisberg, the Web site's chief political correspondent, will take the cake. Mr. Weisberg beat out Jack Shafer, the deputy editor of Slate, after each took a turn as editor once Michael Kinsley announced he was stepping down in February.
4/29/2002	Why Gates Has Trouble Saying He's Sorry	Whatever the outcome of the Microsoft trial, don't expect Bill Gates to say he's sorry. For the most part, the Bill Gates on the witness stand at the company's antitrust trial last week was a public relations dream. Gone was the uncooperative persona displayed on a videotaped deposition earlier in the case.
4/26/2002	Executive Testifies Microsoft Must Be Able to Alter Windows	A Microsoft executive told a federal judge today that the company should be allowed to make changes in its Windows operating system that impair the performance of other programs so long as the company believes it is acting in the best interest of Windows users. Christopher Jones, a Microsoft vice president in charge of Windows, testified against penalties that a coalition of states want the court to impose on Microsoft to redress the company's antitrust violations. Among the states' proposals is a requirement that Microsoft refrain from interfering with the way rival software works on its operating system without ''good cause.''
4/25/2002	The Workaround: 32 Steps to Frustration	THAT software does not always work correctly is roughly as surprising as finding a cockroach in a New York apartment. But at least apartment dwellers can resort to exterminators. Computer users, by contrast, are often faced with software companies that don't even try to fix what is wrong. Instead, they issue what are known as workarounds, jury-rigged measures that call for users to ''work around'' the problem. In effect, ''they say, 'It's not a bug, it's a feature,' '' said Jakob Nielsen, a consultant on Web use who lives in Fremont, Calif. If a program works oddly, he said, the companies ''just write in the manual'' rather than fix the product.
4/25/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Microsoft To Back Advanced Micro Chips	Advanced Micro Devices said yesterday that its next-generation family of microprocessors had won support from Microsoft, giving the chip maker a crucial ally for its most important new product. The two companies announced no specific products, but said they had begun working together to ensure that the new Advanced Micro chips, which permit both 32-bit and 64-bit processing, are supported by future versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system. The chips are an important part of Advanced Micro's strategy to entice corporate buyers. Sixty-four-bit systems, increasingly popular for engineering and computer animation, can use more memory and perform a greater range of calculations than standard 32-bit systems. Microsoft sells operating systems for each. The new chip for powerful corporate PC's and servers will be called Opteron and will be available in the first half of 2003, Advanced Micro said. The version for desktop and notebook PC's, expected later this year, will be called Athlon. Chris Gaither (NYT)
4/25/2002	Hobbled by Microsoft Policy	To the Editor: Re the brief item in Q & A (April 4) on reinstalling the Windows operating system and other programs that have grown sluggish over time: Uninstalling and reinstalling Word may sound like a good idea except for Microsoft's requirement of activation with Office XP, which I installed on the three computers in our house. After I ran into problems doing just what you suggest, Microsoft told me that I couldn't run the software I had bought because it had already been activated.
4/25/2002	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the testimony of Bill Gates in Microsoft's antitrust case misstated the timing of a settlement agreement by the Justice Department and nine states. It was in November 2001, not in January.
4/25/2002	Gates Ends Testimony, Again Invoking Sanctity of Windows	In his last day of testimony before a federal judge, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, acknowledged that the modular version of his company's Windows operating system that he has said would be impossible to produce is already being sold to some customers. A major restriction sought by nine states pursuing antitrust penalties against Microsoft would require the company to provide a version of its Windows operating system that would allow computer makers to pick which Microsoft's programs to include with it. That would enable consumers to choose from a broader range of differently priced systems with programs produced by Microsoft rivals, the states contend.
4/24/2002	Gates Says Court Ruling Could Doom Windows System	Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, insisted in court today that the company would have to remove its Windows operating system from the market if the court adopted a crucial proposal of the states seeking tougher antitrust penalties against it. The states want Microsoft to sell a version of Windows that allows computer makers to replace the Internet Explorer Web browser and several other components with software produced by rivals. The proposal says the stripped-down Windows must function without degradation.
4/24/2002	Fears About Microsoft Return, in Mexico	While Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, defended the company against charges of monopolistic practices before Congress this week, legislators in Mexico City prepared their own attack against a new agreement by Microsoft and the Mexican government that could drive millions of new Internet users into Microsoft's waiting arms by the end of the year. Last week, Microsoft agreed to support the e-Mexico project, a government initiative to bring Internet access within reach of 9 of 10 Mexicans by the end of the six-year presidential term of Vicente Fox. Microsoft will provide millions of dollars worth of free or discount-price software, training and support over the next five years and train 20,000 technicians and engineers to set up and run hundreds of e-Mexico public computer centers across the country. The government put the value of the donation at $30 million; Microsoft valued it at $6 million.
4/23/2002	Gates Testifies Of Dire Results If Penalties Stand	Bill Gates, the chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, took the witness stand today for the first time in the antitrust case against the company, declaring that the penalties sought by a coalition of state prosecutors would cripple Microsoft, harm consumers and drag the entire computer industry into stagnation. Opening his appearance with a multimedia presentation, Mr. Gates could almost have been at an industry trade show. He demonstrated why he believes that the states' proposals would fracture the Windows operating system used by millions of Americans, sowing confusion and driving up prices.
4/23/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Xbox Programmer Leaves Microsoft	Seamus Blackley, left, a programmer who persuaded Microsoft to make its first video-game system, the Xbox, resigned yesterday to join a game-design start-up. As Xbox's chief technology officer, Mr. Blackley had become its most outspoken evangelist. His departure came less than a week after Microsoft announced disappointing Xbox sales in Europe and Japan and lowered its sales forecasts. In interviews, Mr. Blackley and a Microsoft spokesman said the resignation had nothing to do with the sales shortfall. Mr. Blackley, who had created games for DreamWorks Interactive before joining Microsoft, said he missed making video games, as opposed to marketing the Xbox, and was leaving to join friends in starting a company, whose details he would not disclose.

4/22/2002	MediaTalk; E-Books: An Idea Whose Time Hasn't Come	In October 2000, Dick Brass, a vice president of Microsoft in charge of its efforts to promote electronic books, presided over the first annual Frankfurt eBook Awards, held at an opera house in Frankfurt. Financed mainly by Microsoft, the awards presented prizes of up to $50,000 to winning authors of books available in digital form. ''Someday, when electronic books replace print, these will just be called the book awards,'' Mr. Brass said in an interview then.
4/20/2002	Gates to Take Witness Stand In States' Case On Microsoft	The chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, is scheduled to appear in federal court in Washington on Monday to testify against tougher penalties sought by nine states that are still pursuing the landmark antitrust case against his company. The appearance will be the first time Mr. Gates has taken the witness stand in the four-year-old case. His testimony and his performance under cross-examination could prove pivotal in determining what restrictions Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court decides to impose on Microsoft, antitrust experts said.
4/19/2002	Hints of Woe As Microsoft Posts Gains	Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, delivered what it said were strong PC software results today combined with weaker corporate sales for its third fiscal quarter in 2002, suggesting that the company is being held back by the stagnant economy. Microsoft also scaled back its projections for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2002 and for its 2003 fiscal year. The pessimistic guidance indicated that like the world's largest computer maker, I.B.M., which reported disappointing first-quarter results on Wednesday, Microsoft is having trouble escaping a dismal corporate business environment.
4/19/2002	Microsoft Denies Any Big Advantage in Online Identity Field	David Cole, senior vice president for Microsoft's MSN and Personal Services Group, told a federal judge today that the company's control of the Windows operating system did not give it an ''insurmountable'' advantage in the critical new field of online identity services, contrary to the testimony of a Sun Microsystems executive. Mr. Cole was the first Microsoft executive to testify against the stiff antitrust penalties nine states and the District of Columbia are asking the court to impose on the company. He also disputed the assertion of an AOL Time Warner witness that the Microsoft identity service, Passport, requires users to provide personal information.
4/17/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: 'P3P' Becomes A Web Standard	A technology designed to help consumers guard their privacy online, the Platform for Privacy Preferences, was officially adopted as a recommended standard yesterday by the World Wide Web Consortium, an international standards body. The technology, known as P3P, allows browser software to detect Web sites' privacy policies and compare them with a set of preferences specified by users; the software then warns users when sites fail to measure up. ''P3P serves as the keystone to resolving larger issues of both privacy and security on the Web,'' said Tim Berners-Lee, director of the standards group, at the annual Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference. The technology, which has been available to Web sites for months and which has been adopted by Microsoft, has not yet gained wide acceptance. John Schwartz (NYT)
4/17/2002	Microsoft And Mexico Aim to Put Nation Online	Mexico and Microsoft plan to announce an agreement on Wednesday to develop digital community centers as part of a broader ''eMexico'' initiative meant to bring the entire nation online by 2006. Microsoft will contribute software, consulting and training for the centers, which are to be built in remote Mexican towns and villages to give residents free access to the Internet. Microsoft will license its Windows, Office and Encarta software on the same terms that colleges and universities use and will train 4,000 computer operators to run the centers.
4/17/2002	Economist Testifies For Microsoft	An economist testifying for the Microsoft Corporation told a federal judge today that the company's antitrust violations had not harmed consumers or significantly damaged competition in the market for PC operating systems. Kevin M. Murphy, an economist at the University of Chicago, said the court would be justified in imposing only a narrow set of restrictions on Microsoft, given the lack of evidence that the competitive landscape would look any different had the company not acted illegally to preserve its Windows monopoly.
4/16/2002	U.S. Says Dissenting States Can Pursue Microsoft	In a setback to Microsoft, the Justice Department said today that the nine states dissenting from its antitrust settlement with the company had the legal authority to pursue tougher penalties on their own. Microsoft had asked Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of United States District Court here to dismiss the case, arguing that individual states did not have the right to seek penalties that would apply to the whole country. The judge asked the Justice Department for its view on the motion.
4/15/2002	New Economy; A computer scientist's lament: grammar has lost its technological edge.	BRUCE WAMPLER is nostalgic for a not-so-bygone era when software developers battled each other feature by feature for the affections of personal computer users. Dr. Wampler, a computer scientist, was the principal author of Grammatik, which from the mid-1980's until the early 1990's was one of four leading grammar-checking programs for the desktop PC.
4/15/2002	States Are Set To Rest Case On Penalties For Microsoft	The states pursuing stiff antitrust sanctions against the Microsoft Corporation are preparing to rest their case today, clearing the way for what is expected to be a month of testimony by Microsoft witnesses who will urge a federal judge to apply a lighter touch. The coalition of state attorneys general say their proposal will open up competition in emerging technologies that may eventually replace the ubiquitous Windows operating system as the link for consumers to their computing machines. Microsoft and the Justice Department, which have reached a less restrictive settlement, say the states' plan would confuse consumers and bestow unfair advantages on the company's rivals.
4/12/2002	Expert Lists Goals of a Microsoft Penalty	Antitrust sanctions against the Microsoft Corporation should seek to repair the damage the company's illegal conduct did to competition and consumers in addition to preventing a repetition of its misdeeds, an economics expert told a federal judge yesterday. Prof. Carl Shapiro, an economist who served as the expert witness for nine states seeking broader regulations of Microsoft's business practices, spelled out for the first time in the current hearing the economic rationale behind several of the states' proposals.
4/11/2002	Microsoft, I.B.M. and VeriSign To Cooperate on Web Security	Microsoft, I.B.M. and VeriSign plan to announce a new technical approach today that they hope will ensure greater security and thus stimulate commercial development of an emerging Internet technology called Web services. Web services is the term used to describe clever software that in theory could bring a new level of automation and greater productivity to all kinds of online transactions among companies, suppliers and consumers. Yet the new, unproven technology -- which uses the Web to find and share data in electronic databases of companies or individuals -- has stirred concerns about data security and personal privacy.

4/11/2002	Microsoft Suit Gets Into Issue Of Disclosure	A computer science expert sparred with a Microsoft lawyer today over one of the central questions in the antitrust hearing: What should Microsoft be required to disclose about its Windows operating system to rival software developers, and when should it disclose it? Andrew W. Appel, a professor of computer science at Princeton University, said that the rules Microsoft had proposed -- and that the Justice Department had approved -- would not require the software maker to disclose any more information than it did before it was found liable for violating federal antitrust laws.
4/11/2002	Microsoft Has Quietly Shelved Its Internet 'Persona' Service	Microsoft has quietly shelved a consumer information service that was once planned as the centerpiece of the company's foray into the market for tightly linked Web services. The service, originally code-named Hailstorm and later renamed My Services, was to be the clearest example of the company's ambitious .Net strategy. It was intended to permit an individual to keep an online persona independent of his or her desktop computer, supposedly safely stored as part of a vast data repository where there could be easy access to it from any point on the Internet.
4/11/2002	A Greeting Steals Its Way Into Your Hard Drive	Outlook owners, look out. Users of Microsoft's popular e-mail program are the targets of a new computer virus, made by an artist, that arrives disguised as an electronic greeting card. When the card is opened, the virus spreads by randomly picking three images from the recipient's hard drive and sending them in a flickering message to everyone in the victim's Outlook address book. Mark Daggett, a new-media artist in Los Angeles, said that his program, which he calls the VCard, was an art project, not a true virus, because recipients must actively agree to reveal their computers' contents. (To view a VCard, recipients must click on a ''yes'' button after being informed that their own images will be sent out.) ''I'm not as malicious'' as a virus writer, Mr. Daggett said. ''It may be sensationalistic, but it says up front what it is.''
4/9/2002	Microsoft Tries to Discredit Antitrust Testimony From SBC	The Microsoft Corporation suggested in court today that SBC Communications was seeking tough antitrust restrictions against it to cripple its ability to compete in the telecommunications market. SBC, the second-largest local telephone company in the United States, was the latest target of Microsoft's strategy of questioning the motives of executives who testify in support of the nine states that are seeking tighter controls on Microsoft's activities.
4/8/2002	Microsoft Programmers Hit the Books in a New Focus on Secure Software	On this sprawling corporate campus that is the heartland of personal computing, 9,000 elite Microsoft employees have gone back to school. Stung by a chorus of critics who said that its software code was increasingly buggy and vulnerable to attack, Microsoft began sending its programmers to a special course in writing secure software. And it ordered them to stop creating new programs until they had painstakingly re-examined the millions of lines of Windows operating system software for potential vulnerabilities.
4/5/2002	AOL Official And Lawyer For Microsoft Spar in Court	An executive of America Online told a federal judge today that Microsoft was using its Windows operating system to ''tilt'' users toward its own versions of technology that both companies see as the gateway to a lucrative new business called Web services. John Borthwick, the vice president for advanced services of America Online, sparred with Microsoft's lawyer, Richard C. Pepperman, who displayed internal AOL documents acknowledging that Microsoft's .Net technology was open to all developers and designed to run on any platform, not just Windows.
4/4/2002	President Set to Step Down at Microsoft	Richard Belluzzo, who has been the president and chief operating officer of Microsoft for little more than a year, will step down next month and leave Microsoft in September, company said yesterday. The departure of Mr. Belluzzo, 48, is part of a reorganization that is intended to give the heads of Microsoft's business divisions greater independence.
4/4/2002	Microsoft Says Court Should Not Design Computer Systems	The hearings over the Microsoft antitrust case returned today to what has been the most hotly contested question since the government filed its suit four years ago: Can a court tell the company how to design its own software code? Testifying in federal court here, an executive of America Online urged a judge to require Microsoft to license a stripped-down version of its Windows operating system that computer makers and other companies could choose to package with Web browsers, media players and other software components made by Microsoft competitors.
4/4/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Dell Adds Server Models	Dell Computer said yesterday that it would soon begin selling two new lines of data-serving computers as part of an effort to dominate the low-end server market, as it has the personal computer market. Dell, based in Austin, Tex., said it would put its so-called blade servers, which are especially small systems, on the market in the third quarter. Two larger servers, running Intel processors, will go on sale in May. Dell also said it would work with Microsoft on developing new servers that use InfiniBand technology, which supporters say moves data through computers more quickly. Separately, Dell said it remained on track to earn 16 cents a diluted share for its first quarter, which ends May 3. Chris Gaither (NYT)
4/3/2002	Executive Fearful of Microsoft in Interactive TV Software	The chief executive of a company that makes software for interactive television said today that Microsoft could, and probably would, stifle new software that posed a threat to its computer operating system monopoly unless stiffer restrictions were imposed on its business practices. The executive, Mitchell Kertzman of Liberate Technologies, was the 10th witness to testify on behalf of nine states and the District of Columbia, which are seeking broader curbs on Microsoft than the Justice Department proposed after an appeals court ruled that Microsoft had repeatedly broken antitrust laws.
3/29/2002	Novell Official Says He Sought Microsoft's Aid	Novell, once the biggest maker of software for corporate networks, offered two years ago to tell antitrust enforcers that Microsoft had altered its behavior in return for help promoting its products, a Novell executive testified today. The chief technology officer for Novell, Carl S. Ledbetter, testifying for nine states seeking tougher remedies than those Microsoft accepted to settle the federal government's four-year-old case, described a Feb. 8, 2000, meeting with officials of Microsoft, the world's biggest software company.
3/28/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: XBOX Sales Estimate Cut	Analysts with the SoundView Technology Group, an investment bank, lowered their estimates for sales of Microsoft's inaugural video game console, the Xbox, citing performances in Japan and Europe that were weaker than expected. The analysts, Mark Specker and Shawn Milne, said that they expected Microsoft to miss its sales predictions of 4.5 million to 6 million consoles for its fiscal year, which ends June 30. SoundView lowered its estimates to 4.35 million from 4.6 million, with 62 percent of those sales coming from the United States. In spite of ''subdued launches'' in Europe and Japan, SoundView said, Microsoft had won 22 percent of the market for next-generation game systems in the United States market, demonstrating commercial viability of the Xbox. Officials of Xbox were not available to comment. Chris Gaither (NYT)
3/27/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Restates Results	Microsoft said yesterday that it had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to restate nearly $1 billion in revenue related to products and licensing agreements lasting longer than one year. The company attributed the mistakes for the quarters ended Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, 2001, to a clerical error. Microsoft waits to report part of its revenue from software sales until it ''earns'' the money by shipping interim upgrades and repairs of flaws and supplying customer support services. In the case of Windows, the company typically defers 15 percent to 25 percent of revenue and then books that amount over three years. Microsoft now says it recognized $1.879 billion in deferred revenue in the September quarter and booked $2.069 billion of ''unearned revenue.'' It originally recognized $914 million and added $1.104 billion during the period. The company said, however, that its net cash from operations and net change in cash and equivalents were unaffected.

3/27/2002	Microsoft Judge Seeks Justice Dept.'s View	The federal judge hearing a challenge by nine states to the Justice Department's proposed antitrust settlement with Microsoft invited the Bush administration today to say whether the challengers have the authority to do so. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court sought the Justice Department's legal advice to help her decide on Microsoft's request to dismiss the broader restrictions sought by a coalition of states led by California and Iowa.
3/25/2002	Sun Aims to Extend a Lead	In federal court, Sun Microsystems has portrayed Microsoft's Internet services software effort -- known as .Net -- as a virtually unstoppable monopoly. On Monday, Sun will try to cast itself as a Microsoft beater. Sun, a major producer of software and hardware, plans to announce an ambitious effort for the wireless Internet -- a market in which Sun's Java programming language is already widely used and Microsoft's .Net is barely an also-ran.
3/25/2002	Testing Limits On Microsoft	The second week of arguments begins today over what penalties Microsoft should face for repeatedly violating antitrust law, and the federal judge presiding over the trial in Washington has postponed ruling on the case's most contested question: how broad is the scope of this remedy proceeding? The Justice Department and nine states have settled with Microsoft, but nine other states -- California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Utah and West Virginia -- and the District of Columbia are pursuing stronger measures that they say are needed to prevent Microsoft from repeating its illegal conduct in new markets.
3/22/2002	Ex-Gateway Executive Says Microsoft Bullies PC Makers	The Microsoft Corporation bullies computer makers by withholding discounts if they promote products that threaten its Windows monopoly, a former Gateway Inc. executive testified today on behalf of states seeking tough antitrust remedies against Microsoft. The executive, Peter Ashkin, said that the Justice Department's proposed settlement of the four-year-old case would not stop Microsoft from punishing computer makers like Gateway that develop rival products. The states called Mr. Ashkin to testify on the fourth day of what is expected to be eight weeks of court hearings on their demands.
3/21/2002	In Microsoft Case, RealNetworks Says Competition Is Unfair	A RealNetworks executive accused Microsoft today of withholding information that would have allowed RealNetworks' video and audio software to work as well with Microsoft's operating system as rival software made by Microsoft does. At a hearing that will determine what penalties Microsoft will face for violating federal antitrust laws, David Richards, vice president for consumer systems at RealNetworks, also said Microsoft had pressed computer makers not to allow RealPlayer, from RealNetworks, to start automatically when their machines booted up. Microsoft's Media Player is a competing service.
3/21/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Citigroup Selects Microsoft	Microsoft won an endorsement yesterday for its online identification software from Citigroup. It said it would use Microsoft's Passport identity software and .Net Web services technology to improve service to online customers. Citigroup now has 16 million online accounts among its banking, brokerage and credit card customers, up from 3 million two years ago. The automated identification software is intended to make it easier for people to shop online and have personalized instant messages sent to a computer or cellphone for account updates or fraud alerts, for example. Such features should be available to Citigroup customers by the end of the year. As part of the agreement, Citigroup's credit cards will be promoted on MSN, Microsoft's consumer Web site. No financial details of the agreement were disclosed. Citigroup will remain a member of a group, the Liberty Alliance, that is backing a rival online identification technology, an effort begun by Sun Microsystems. Steve Lohr (NYT)
3/20/2002	Ex-Chief of Netscape Criticizes Microsoft's Penalty Proposal	The penalties the Microsoft Corporation has proposed in the final phase of a landmark antitrust case would allow the company to engage in the same kind of illegal conduct that helped it quash the Internet browser of the Netscape Communications in the 1990's, James L. Barksdale, Netscape's former chief executive, told a federal judge today. On the witness stand, Mr. Barksdale, perhaps Microsoft's most outspoken critic, faced Microsoft's lawyer, John Warden, in what sometimes seemed like a reprise of Mr. Warden's cross-examination of Mr. Barksdale in the first phase of the trial in October 1998.
3/19/2002	States Seeking Stiffer Penalty For Microsoft	As the landmark antitrust battle against the Microsoft Corporation enters its latest phase, the company's opponents are trying to shift the focus to how Microsoft will be prevented from abusing its market power in new technologies. The penalty phase of the long-running case began in a federal courtroom here today, with nine states that have broken away from a settlement between Microsoft and the government telling the judge that unless the court imposed stronger punishments on the company, it would continue using its monopoly on the personal computer operating system to crush rivals in technologies like media players and the Linux operating system.
3/18/2002	Compressed Data; A Cellphone-Computer, And It Does Windows	A new hybrid cellphone and hand-held computer, expected from Verizon Wireless in late spring, will be the first phone powered by an operating system from Microsoft to be offered in the United States by telecommunications companies. Made by Audiovox and called the Thera, it features components and software by the biggest names in personal computers. The Thera runs on a 206-megahertz processor by Intel. The Pocket PC operating system, a smaller version of Windows for gadgets, powers the device, which also has features like Word and the Windows Media Player.
3/18/2002	Microsoft, Back in Court Again	The Microsoft antitrust litigation enters a new phase today in a federal courtroom in Washington. Nine state attorneys general will make the case that a settlement reached with the Justice Department and other states last November does not go far enough. Critics of that settlement object that it is filled with vague language and possible loopholes, which they believe Microsoft will exploit to continue to use its Windows monopoly to gain illegal advantage. The non-settling states want to toughen the language of the agreement and add some new conditions. High on their list is forcing Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without the Internet Explorer browser, to give competing browsers a clearer shot at winning users. The presiding judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, has broad authority to accept the proposed settlement as it is written, to reject it, or to make changes. She also has the power to add additional sanctions, as critics of the settlement are urging. The trial is expected to last weeks.
3/14/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: 'Trojan' Linked To Microsoft Hoax	Computer security experts said a new virus travels the Internet attached to an e-mail message that purports to be from the ''Microsoft Corporation Security Center.'' The program ''eliminates all known security vulnerabilities'' affecting the company's programs, the message states. Clue: Microsoft does not send software via e-mail messages. Those gullible enough to start the program, technically known as a Trojan horse, end up sending copies to those in their PC's address book. The program also opens a back door that could allow the program's creator unauthorized access. ''You never want to give anyone a key to your house,'' said Sharon Ruckman, senior director of Symantec Security Response. Update software that helps to block the program can be downloaded from most computer security companies; experts say it does not pose a major threat, but they grudgingly give the creator points for creativity. John Schwartz (NYT)
3/14/2002	Piracy, or Innovation? It's Hollywood vs. High Tech	Leaders of two of the nation's most prominent industries, entertainment and technology, have begun publicly sniping at each other over how to stop consumers from illegally copying digital movies, music and television programs. The feud grows out of Hollywood's frustration with the illicit flow of copyrighted works over the Internet. Despite courtroom victories against Napster and others deemed to contribute to Internet piracy, millions of people continue to download free digital copies of everything from Jennifer Lopez's latest hit single to the Disney movie ''Monsters, Inc.''
3/14/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Xbox Hits Europe	With a marketing blitz that includes bathing a Spanish soccer arena in alien-green lights, Microsoft today will begin selling its inaugural video game console, the Xbox, in 16 European countries and Australia. With 20 games available to start with, Microsoft is trying to regain momentum lost with its tepid introduction last month in Japan, the home turf of its competitors, Sony and Nintendo. Some Xbox consoles scratched game disks, causing a public relations headache for Microsoft and forcing it to offer to replace faulty machines. At $423 in Britain and $419 in Continental Europe, the Xbox costs almost $100 more than Sony's PlayStation2. Schelley Olhava, a senior analyst with the International Data Corporation, said Microsoft stood a better chance in Europe than in Japan because game players there have similar tastes to players in North America. ''If Japan hasn't done well, as we all believe, Europe is going to be really crucial for them,'' Ms. Olhava said. Chris Gaither (NYT)
3/13/2002	Microsoft Tries a New Approach To Win Over Europe Regulators	In a bid to reach a settlement of its European antitrust lawsuit, Microsoft said today that it was about to submit concessions to address the concerns of the European Commission. But critics said there was little new in the offer and that it fell far short of meeting the concerns raised by the commission.
3/9/2002	Microsoft Hearings Are Postponed for a Week	The presiding judge in the final stages of the Microsoft antitrust trial today postponed by a week hearings to determine whether the company should face tougher sanctions. She also expressed irritation with the states proposing those sanctions. On Monday, nine state attorneys general gave the court a revised proposal for a remedy that included numerous changes and clarifications.
3/9/2002	Unhappy With Settlement, Sun Sues Microsoft	Dissatisfied with the federal government's antitrust settlement with Microsoft, Sun Microsystems filed a private lawsuit today accusing Microsoft of ''choking off'' Sun's Java programming language through illegal behavior. The suit, filed in United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., is the latest complaint brought by a competitor in the wake of a legal ruling upheld by a federal appeals court last June that Microsoft was a monopolist that used illegal methods to defend its position. The court ruled specifically that Sun and Netscape Communications, maker of the first commercial Internet browser, had suffered.
3/8/2002	Corrections	A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about a hearing in the Microsoft antitrust case misstated the roles of Kenneth W. Starr and Robert H. Bork. The two lawyers represent ProComp, a trade group critical of the proposed settlement. Mr. Starr does not represent the company, and Mr. Bork does not represent other groups opposing the settlement.
3/7/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Sony Says No Fee For Online Games	Laying down a challenge to Microsoft, Sony Computer Entertainment America is expected to announce today that it will not charge a monthly fee to connect its popular PlayStation 2 video game console to the Internet. Sony said it would begin selling a network adapter, which permits players to play online games through a dial-up modem or a broadband connection, in August for $39.99. Unlike Sega, which charges $9.95 a month for players to compete online, Sony will permit players to connect through their own Internet service providers. ''Players are interested in experimenting with online, but not paying for it,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony. The service will work only for games that have online features built in. Microsoft included equipment for a broadband connection in its Xbox console, but has not yet discussed how Xbox users will connect to the Internet. Chris Gaither (NYT)
3/7/2002	Judge Says Ruling on Microsoft Won't Come Quickly	The Bush administration and nine states urged a federal judge today to approve their settlement of the Microsoft antitrust case swiftly and reject a raft of complaints by rivals and consumer groups. At the conclusion of a daylong hearing here, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court said the case's many complexities required her to spend time examining all the issues and that her decision would not be imminent.
3/6/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Seeks Delay	Microsoft sought a two-week postponement of hearings on a proposal by nine states pursuing restrictions on its business, saying it needed time to study last-minute changes to the plan. The hearings, scheduled to begin on Monday, concern remedies that go beyond a settlement Microsoft reached with the Justice Department and nine other states. Lawyers representing Microsoft argued that the modification yesterday of an earlier proposal by states that have not settled occurred without notice and without the court's permission, entitling the company to more time to study the changes.
3/5/2002	9 States Modify Proposal to Stiffen Microsoft Remedies	A group of states seeking stronger antitrust sanctions against Microsoft modified their proposed remedies yesterday to try to assure a federal judge that their proposals were technically practical and not a recipe for chaos in the personal computer industry, as Microsoft has predicted. The change came as the two sides prepared to go to court next week, with Microsoft defending its settlement with the Bush administration as a significant step to insure greater competition, while the nine dissenting states argue that the settlement will bring little change to the industry.
3/1/2002	U.S. Endorses Microsoft Plea Modifications	In expectation of a new round of court hearings, Microsoft and the Bush administration announced some modest changes today in the proposed settlement of the government's antitrust case. The modifications and recent flurry of court filings over the merits and shortcomings of the settlement plan represent the final maneuvering before a federal district judge begins separate but related proceedings to consider the deal, as well as a tougher list of sanctions being sought by nine states that have chosen not to join in the settlement.
2/28/2002	Yet Another Jab At Windows	MICHAEL ROBERTSON, who found himself at the center of the digital music revolution as chief executive of MP3.com, has moved to a new battleground. He wants to build a powerful, crashproof computer operating system that runs all the most popular programs flawlessly and is one-third the cost of Microsoft Windows. It is no small task. And already, as in his last job, he has aimed his slingshot directly at Goliath.
2/24/2002	Technology's Threats to Privacy	Microsoft's newest Media Player, included free with Windows XP software, has a privacy-invading feature that came to light last week. Media Player quietly keeps a log, stored on the user's own computer, of the DVD's it plays. So users who thought they were watching movies privately were actually leaving behind records of what they have viewed. The software also sends information back to Microsoft in a way that allows the company to match individuals with their music and movie choices. It is not surprising that technological innovations can come at the cost of privacy. What is troubling is that in many recent cases, sensitive information has been compromised in ways that even a vigilant user had no way of guarding against. Last month, Eli Lilly & Company promised the Federal Trade Commission, as part of a legal settlement, that it would improve its online security after it unintentionally disseminated the e-mail addresses of more than 600 people taking Prozac.
2/21/2002	New Claim by Opponents of Microsoft Pact	A group of states suing Microsoft, citing recent testimony from a company executive, have told a federal court that Microsoft has used the Bush administration's antitrust settlement as ''a sword to extract valuable concessions'' from personal computer makers. The nine states, which filed their motion late Tuesday in the Federal District Court in Washington, said that the government's proposed settlement had already been used by the company ''to provide a net benefit for Microsoft and a net harm to those -- Microsoft's customers, competitors and consumers -- whom a decree is intended to benefit.''
2/19/2002	Microsoft Is Ordered to Give Code to Opponents in Court	A federal judge has ruled that Microsoft must give nine states that are seeking tougher sanctions against the company access to the software code for its flagship Windows operating system. The order from Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly came during a conference call late on Friday with lawyers representing Microsoft and the nine states that object to the government's settlement with the company.
2/19/2002	Supercomputing and Business Move Closer	A worldwide computing project known as grid, whose long-term vision is to bring the power of supercomputing to individuals, is taking a step out of the laboratory and into the commercial mainstream. In a paper that was presented yesterday at a conference in Toronto, four computer scientists laid out a plan for marrying their grid technology for distributed computing with so-called Web services -- the technical standards that major computer companies are betting on to deliver a new generation of offerings on the Internet.
2/18/2002	New Riddle for Xbox: Will It Play in Japan?	Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo.
2/14/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: States Seek Windows Code	Nine states that oppose the proposed Microsoft antitrust settlement have asked a judge to let them examine the so-called source code of the company's Windows operating system. California, Iowa and the seven other states want to force the software maker to sell a version of Windows without the Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft argues that removing the Web search program from Windows would destroy the system. The states that refused to sign the settlement negotiated by the Bush administration said that they needed access to the Windows code to rebut Microsoft's argument that their proposal was not technically feasible. Microsoft has refused to give the states access to the Windows code, the states said in a court filing made public yesterday.
2/13/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: States Oppose Microsoft Witness List	State antitrust enforcers asked a federal judge yesterday to bar Microsoft from calling Bill Gates and 17 other possible witnesses. They were among 23 people whosenames were added by Microsoft last week to its list of potential witnesses for the hearings, which are scheduled to start March 11. Microsoft, the leading maker of software, said in its own court filing yesterday that the additions to the list were a response to the ''sweeping and draconian'' remedy that had been proposed by the states. The exchange was the latest in a series of volleys between the sides as they prepare for a courtroom showdown next month in a long-running battle over the company's business practices.
2/13/2002	Microsoft Is Putting Its Muscle Behind Web Programming Tools	After spending three and a half years, five million hours of labor and $2 billion, Microsoft begins a huge campaign today to woo millions of computer programmers to use its new generation of Internet software tools. Programming tools may be an arcane niche of the computer industry. But, underscoring how crucial the new campaign is to Microsoft's strategy for growth, Bill Gates, the chairman, is scheduled to speak to thousands of software developers in San Francisco, and Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, will speak to thousands more in Chicago.
2/13/2002	Computer Security Experts Warn of Internet Vulnerability	Asserting that companies had not heeded its private warnings, a government-backed computer security group warned of a security flaw today that could make computers across the Internet and within company networks vulnerable to being controlled or shut down by malicious hackers. The group, the CERT Coordination Center, based at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and backed by the Defense Department, said it decided to publicize the flaw because word of its existence had begun leaking out to potential intruders, who security experts feared might soon exploit it.
2/10/2002	Microsoft's Top Officials May Testify to Help Fight Sanctions	To make its case against severe sanctions, Microsoft, shifting its previous strategy, has named both Bill Gates, its cofounder and chairman, and Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, as witnesses in a trial on remedies in the antitrust case it lost. The opposing sides in the remedies trial -- Microsoft and nine states -- exchanged witness lists late Friday night. In addition to Mr. Gates, Mr. Ballmer and other company executives, the Microsoft list includes 21 expert and industry witnesses including representatives from other software makers, personal computer manufacturers, an electronics retailer, a telephone company, a cable television company and a venture capital firm.
2/8/2002	Remarks on Microsoft Case Mostly Oppose Settlement	The public -- along with a predictable collection of lawyers and lobbyists -- has delivered its verdict on the government's settlement plan in the Microsoft case. Thumbs down, it seems, according to the sprawling democratic cacophony found in some 30,000 public comments received by the Justice Department. In a joint filing by the government and Microsoft in Federal District Court in Washington yesterday, the rough tabulation presented was 7,500 comments in favor of the settlement announced last November and 15,000 opposed, while the rest did not comment directly on the settlement.
2/8/2002	Computer Safety Is Focus of Bill	The House approved more than $800 million in grants today covering the next five years for the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to conduct research on ways to strengthen network and computer security. ''Our economy relies on a vast information infrastructure that is woefully under protected,'' said Representative Brian Baird, Democrat of Washington.
2/8/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Game Industry Sales Surge	Even as other industries suffered through a slumping economy, sales of video game systems and software rose 43 percent in 2001, to $9.4 billion, the NPD Group, a research firm, said yesterday. Sony's year-old PlayStation2 dominated the market, which received a strong lift in November from new consoles from Nintendo and Microsoft. After record sales of $6.9 billion in 1999, the game industry retrenched slightly in 2000, with revenue of $6.6 billion. But game makers sold 39 percent more consoles in 2001 than the previous year, and the higher prices of the three next-generation systems drove revenue up 120 percent. Sales of entertainment software, which included games for consoles and personal computers, rose 11 percent, to $6 billion. The NPD Group, formerly known as NPD Intelect, said the industry would have trouble beating the 2001 results because most of the sales growth came from the introduction of the new, more expensive consoles.

2/7/2002	New Hand-Helds With Color To Make a Peacock Blush	The Palm and Pocket PC operating systems are the Hatfields and McCoys of the hand-held-computer world. Recently, two new hand-helds emerged, one from each side of the valley. At half an inch thick, Sony's Clié PEG-T615C ($399) combines the slim T-series shape with a sharp color screen that Sony says is more vivid, especially in harsh light. The new Clié comes with 16 megabytes of memory, most of the usual features of a Palm hand-held and a few extras, like Clié Paint, which allows you to save whatever you draw freehand on the screen. By contrast, Casio's new Cassiopeia E-200 is bigger (0.68 inches wide compared with the Clié's 0.5 inches) and more expensive ($599) and has more memory (64 megabytes). It also has a vivid, reflective color screen and two slots for additional memory. The biggest difference, of course, is that the Cassiopeia runs on Microsoft's Pocket PC operating system. So choose: your pocket's not big enough for both of them. Bruce Headlam
2/6/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Palm Update	The hand-held computer maker Palm Inc. said it would deliver a new version of its operating system to computer makers in June or July as it vies with Microsoft for corporate customers. Palm said tests showed programs would run as much as 20 times faster on the new system. Palm's infrequent improvements have made it vulnerable to competition from Microsoft's Pocket PC, analysts said.
2/6/2002	Rivals Join in Effort to Advance Next Step in Internet Technology	I.B.M., Microsoft and BEA Systems -- companies that are usually software competitors -- are joining in a new consortium to try to accelerate the development of what they regard as the next-generation technology of the Internet, called Web services. The group, to be announced today, will be called the Web Services Interoperability Organization, according to industry analysts who have been briefed about it. The purpose of the consortium, one person said, is to agree on a framework for testing Web software from different suppliers to verify that it really does allow the open sharing of data across the Internet.
1/30/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Identity Services Challenged	A privacy group urged state law enforcement officials to investigate Microsoft's online identity services, saying they expose consumers to fraud, an increase in unsolicited commercial e-mail messages and the ''release, sale and theft of their personal information.'' Microsoft created the services, like Passport, Wallet, Kids Passport and .Net Services, to simplify Internet transactions by permitting consumers to store passwords, credit card numbers and other personal data together. ''Immediate state action is necessary to protect consumers and ensure Microsoft does not continue to improperly collect personal information,'' the Electronic Privacy Information Center said in a letter it sent to all 50 state attorneys general. The group, which also sent the letter to some members of Congress and to the Federal Trade Commission, said the company's failure to make people aware of security risks associated with the services was a violation of state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. A spokesman for Microsoft, Rick Miller, said, ''The claims are totally unfounded.''
1/23/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Shuts TV Unit	Microsoft said yesterday that it would be eliminating its troubled UltimateTV division, a competitor to TiVo, which is based in San Jose, Calif. The UltimateTV services, which included digital video recording, will continue despite the elimination of the division. In addition, Microsoft is creating a new TV services group. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)
1/23/2002	An AOL Unit Sues Microsoft, Saying Tactics Were Illegal	The Netscape Communications Corporation, the commercial pioneer in Web browsing software, whose fortunes faded after a withering assault from Microsoft, filed a broad antitrust suit yesterday against the company. Netscape charged that its decline was a result of Microsoft's illegal tactics, echoing many of the findings in the government's case against the company. The suit represents a new round of legal trouble for Microsoft, carrying the potential for billions of dollars in damages and new sanctions on its behavior.
1/20/2002	A New Realism May Set the Corporate Mood	WITH only a few weeks under our belts in 2002, it is too soon to tell what the year's tone will be, either in the stock market or in corporate America. But with reports last week from two bellwether companies -- I.B.M. and Microsoft -- a pattern may be emerging for the way the world will work going forward. Both companies reported desultory results, and the stock market took note. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1 percent of its value on Friday, and the Nasdaq fell 2.79 percent. All the major indexes are down for the year. Although I.B.M. managed to beat analysts' per-share earnings estimates by the usual penny, the company's revenue for 2001 was 3 percent below the total a year-earlier. In addition, hardware revenue plummeted by 12 percent, while sales in the company's services business, its primary profit center, grew by only 3 percent. Normally upbeat and swaggering on such earnings calls, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman, was solemn. ''Business conditions remain difficult as we enter the new year,'' he said.
1/18/2002	Solid Consumer Spending Bolsters Microsoft	Drawing strength from its new video game business and the introduction of its latest version of its industry- dominant Windows operating system, Microsoft reported second-quarter results today that surpassed Wall Street's expectations in both earnings and revenue. The company began shipping its Xbox video game system in November and introduced a consumer-oriented Windows XP operating system in October. The two businesses combined to make an unusually strong showing in the quarter, which is traditionally positive for the company.
1/17/2002	Stung by Security Flaws, Microsoft Makes Software Safety a Top Goal	Seeking to remove the tarnish from Microsoft's reputation for developing secure and reliable software, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, distributed a companywide memorandum on Tuesday to call on employees to put more emphasis on making the company's products ''trustworthy.'' The new emphasis on making software safe from malicious intruders will include stopping the development of new operating system software for the entire month of February and sending the company's 7,000 systems programmers to special security training.
1/13/2002	Making the Mouse More Lovable	Mr. Gorman, 32, helped develop Microsoft's newest mouse, the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer, a cordless, updated version of the IntelliMouse Explorer that uses an optical sensor instead of a trackball. For the new mouse, which costs $70 and went on sale last September, Mr. Gorman coordinated three major improvements over its predecessor: making it wireless, more ergonomically appealing and able to keep up with quick hand movements. He planned the improvements, he said, after interviewing 700 computer users during a three-month ''homework'' period.
1/12/2002	Federal Judge Deals Setback To Microsoft In Private Suits	Microsoft suffered a setback in its recent campaign to resolve its legal problems yesterday, when a federal judge in Baltimore rejected a proposed settlement of more than 100 private class-action suits against the company. Under the proposal, Microsoft had agreed to donate $500 million in cash, in addition to computers and software to thousands of public schools in low-income neighborhoods. Microsoft and plaintiffs' lawyers who agreed to the settlement estimated the total value of the settlement at $1 billion, though opponents of the five-year plan said the figure was inflated because the actual cost to Microsoft of software donations was very little.
1/11/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Wants Interviews Closed	Lawyers representing Microsoft in its antitrust case have asked a federal judge to bar public access to interviews with witnesses that are being conducted in preparation for the remedy phase of the lawsuit. During the antitrust trial, a federal court opened the depositions to the public after a request was made by a group of news organizations, including The New York Times. The request was based on a 1913 law that requires depositions in antitrust cases to be made public. Microsoft maintained that the law did not apply to the proceedings between the company and the nine states that refused to join a proposed settlement with the Justice Department. Several news organizations, including The Times and The Washington Post, said they were considering whether to challenge Microsoft's latest request. Stephen Labaton (NYT)
1/11/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Strong Holiday For Electronics	Holiday sales at Electronics Boutique, a chain of video game specialty stores, surged 57 percent, to $416.4 million from $264.6 million a year earlier. The company, based in West Chester, Pa., attributed the jump, which included a 40 percent increase at stores open at least a year, to strong demand for two consoles, Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox, as well as the continued dominance of Sony's PlayStation2. Electronics Boutique sold nearly 4 games with each Xbox, nearly 5 games with each GameCube and 13 games with each PlayStation2, which has sold eight million units in North America in 14 months. Chris Gaither (NYT)
1/4/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: In A Switch, F.B.I. Endorses XP Patch	The Federal Bureau of Investigation reversed course and said a free software patch offered by Microsoft does protect against serious flaws in the latest version of its Windows software. Microsoft acknowledged last month that a vulnerability in Windows XP could allow hackers to tamper with or destroy users' data files via the Internet, implant rogue software on PC's and even seize control of a user's operating system. Microsoft offered the fix on its Web site in December, when the vulnerability was discovered. A day later, the F.B.I. urged consumers to go beyond installing the fix and to disable some Windows features that could be affected. But officials at the F.B.I.'s National Infrastructure Protection Center, working with researchers at the CERT Coordination Center of Carnegie Mellon University, concluded that Microsoft's patch corrects the problem ''and affords substantial and adequate protection.''
1/3/2002	Redmond Journal; Microsoft's Hometown Sees Cause for Optimism	Tina Terada-Santos and Jerry Santos have plenty of reasons to be glad to work at the Microsoft Corporation, chief among them that it was on their very first day of orientation -- Sept. 5, 2000 -- that they met, and fell in love. They were married 11 months later. While the software behemoth's campus here was the setting for their own love story, it is also proving to be a good place for them to hold employment in this turbulent economy. Microsoft's stock was the best performer in 2001 among the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, rising 53 percent to $66.25, after a dismal year in 2000 in which it lost more than 60 percent of its value. The company has huge amounts of cash on hand, new products like the Xbox game system and the Windows XP operating system are selling well, and the company appears to be on the verge of settling a major part of its antitrust battle with the federal government and several states.
1/1/2002	States Oppose Delay in Microsoft Case	Nine states seeking stricter antitrust penalties against the Microsoft Corporation asked a federal judge to reject the company's proposal to delay hearings in the case until the summer. The states said today in court papers that a new remedies phase of the three-and-a-half-year-old case should be held in March as the judge in the case, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, has ordered. The company proposed delaying it until July or August.
12/31/2001	Using the Voice To Tour the Internet	The Web's next trick? Talk to me. Advances in speech-recognition and speech-synthesis software -- plus ever-faster and cheaper computing -- are finally bringing the prospect of a voice-enabled Internet within earshot.
12/31/2001	In the U.S., Interactive TV Still Awaits An Audience	It has become a familiar refrain the last decade: this is the year for interactive television. It has not happened. But media and technology companies say 2002 may be it. Really. Cable companies, satellite television services, media conglomerates and Microsoft have all made interactive television a key part of their strategic visions. They are pouring billions into a flurry of deals.
12/30/2001	Risks in a Monopoly	To the Editor: Re ''Windows XP Users Told of Security Risks'' (news article, Dec. 23): The recently discovered security problems with Microsoft's newest operating system do not illustrate the dangers of the Internet. Rather, Windows XP's security problems illustrate a design flaw and the dangers of Microsoft's monopoly, which allows Microsoft to develop inferior products that businesses and individuals have little choice but to buy.
12/24/2001	Microsoft Will Buy 3.2% Stake in Korea Telecom	Microsoft agreed on Saturday to buy a $500 million stake in Korea Telecom, giving it an Internet foothold in the world's most wired market. Microsoft and Korea Telecom, which is controlled by the government, said they had agreed on what officials here described as a ''strategic alliance'' under which Microsoft is buying 3.2 percent of Korea Telecom's shares in convertible bonds with warrants to buy stock in the company. The deal calls for Microsoft to pay a 38 percent premium above the listed price of the shares on the Korea Stock Exchange.
12/23/2001	Imagine; The Former Root of All Evil	The case didn't change, but the politics surrounding it did. In late September, a federal judge declared that ''recent tragic events'' made a ''quick resolution'' of the Microsoft antitrust case ''increasingly significant.'' The court-appointed mediator echoed those sentiments and on Nov. 2 the Justice Department and Microsoft announced a settlement to the long-running suit.
12/22/2001	Delay Sought By Microsoft In States' Case	Microsoft asked a federal judge today to delay by at least four months the hearings on the proposed remedies of its antitrust case, a move that would push the proceeding to August at the earliest. The company also announced that one of its witnesses in the hearing might be its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer. The scheduling request was the latest of motions and legal jockeying over the final phase of the case, which is quickly turning into a trial in itself. Microsoft has sought to accelerate the approval of a proposed settlement of the case with the federal government, while the states opposing the deal are preparing to ask the judge to delay a final ruling on that matter until after she has heard the states' case for tougher remedies. Microsoft, in response, has accused the states of broadly expanding the case by seeking a wide range of restrictions that had been rejected by the Bush administration.
12/22/2001	Key Tronic Verdict May Put It in Default	The Key Tronic Corporation said it would not be able to make some loan payments after a jury concluded it must pay $16.5 million for giving stolen trade secrets to the Microsoft Corporation. A federal jury in Seattle found that Key Tronic misappropriated trade secrets and breached a confidentiality agreement with Fernando Falcon, Federico Gilligan and their company, F&G Scrolling Mouse L.L.C., Key Tronic said. The jury determined that Key Tronic disclosed the secrets to Microsoft, which used the information for its IntelliMouse products.
12/22/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Telecom Stake	Microsoft plans to acquire as much as 3 percent of the equity in Korea Telecom, a leading South Korean telephone company and Internet service provider, under a deal that South Korean officials said was ready for signing. Microsoft planned to buy bonds with warrants under which it could purchase shares in the government-controlled company, according to the ministry of information and communications. The signing was postponed, however, because of an unrelated crisis in Argentina that changed the price of the bonds. The stake, when converted into cash at the current value of Korea Telecom stock, would be worth about $360 million. Don Kirk (NYT)
12/22/2001	A Clash of Online Titans	AT&T's sale of its cable television business, the nation's largest, to Comcast, the third-largest, is more than another episode in the continuing consolidation of the nation's cable industry. The bidding war for AT&T Broadband must also be seen as another skirmish in the conflict between Microsoft and AOL Time Warner to control the information pipes that bring news, entertainment and communications services into American households. If federal regulators approve this cable merger, as seems likely, they must impose conditions aimed at preserving and fostering competition in the online world. Microsoft owns a stake in Comcast, though it does not directly operate cable systems itself. But with cable companies' digital or ''broadband'' pipelines ideally positioned to distribute high-speed Internet access, interactive TV and perhaps even local phone service, Microsoft clearly wants to ensure its access to cable. It wants to expand its own Internet service provider and build as dominant a franchise in the market for cable operating software as it has for personal computers.
12/21/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Flaws Found In Windows XP	Microsoft said its new Windows operating system had a ''major'' flaw that could let hackers steal or destroy files or damage computer hard drives. Microsoft shares fell $2.73, or 3.93 percent, to $66.76. The company posted software patches on its Web site for the business and home versions of Windows XP, which went on sale on Oct. 25, and encouraged users to download the fixes immediately. Microsoft, which has touted Windows XP as the most secure version of Windows, has been criticized by security and consumer-advocacy groups for the poor security record of its products. Major flaws have surfaced this year in the company's server software for Internet sites and in its e-mail program.
12/21/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Ruling Deferred In Overcharge Suit	A federal judge postponed for at least three weeks his ruling on Microsoft's $1 billion plan to equip needy schools with computers to settle claims it overcharged consumers. Judge J. Frederick Motz of the United States District Court delayed his decision on the settlement to give Microsoft and the plaintiffs who are settling more time to negotiate an agreement with lawyers opposed to the settlement. The lawsuits accuse Microsoft of abusing its Windows monopoly by overcharging customers for the personal computer operating system and other programs.
12/21/2001	Who Has What and Will Vote What	For each of their shares, holders of AT&T stock will receive .34 share, or about $13.07, in the new AT&T Comcast. Comcast holders will simply be reissued shares in the new company. AT&T has said that its shareholders would own 56 percent of AT&T Comcast, but the full picture of the combined company's ownership is a bit more complex, mostly because of a complicated investment by Microsoft in AT&T.
12/20/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Sony Leads Game Makers	The Sony Corporation has sold 1.5 million PlayStation 2 video game consoles since Thanksgiving, giving it a lead over Nintendo, which markets the GameCube, and Microsoft, with its Xbox. Since introducing the game console in March 2000, Sony has sold more than 20 million units, about one-third of those in the United States. In November, however, Nintendo and Microsoft started selling their own game machines, which have sold more than one million units each. In response, Sony has lowered the price of its consoles in some markets. Ken Belson (NYT)
12/20/2001	COMCAST WINS BID FOR AT&T'S CABLE	AT&T agreed yesterday to sell its cable television business, the nation's largest, to the Comcast Corporation for about $47 billion in stock. The deal would create a cable giant with more than 22 million subscribers, almost twice the size of the next-biggest cable operator, AOL Time Warner, which was a losing bidder in the deal.
12/20/2001	Clash of the Convergers	Comcast won the auction for AT&T's cable television business yesterday, but the other big winner was Microsoft. Using its deep pockets, Microsoft gave financial support to the Comcast bid and thus played the spoiler in denying the prize to its archrival, AOL Time Warner. Most of the nation's 70 million cable television subscribers may wonder why so much corporate emotion and money were involved in the fight over AT&T's cable business. To most people, a cable network is merely a way of delivering garden-variety television and collecting monthly bills.
12/19/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Sale Of Expedia Stake Delayed	Microsoft said yesterday that the sale of its stake in the Expedia travel agency would be delayed because of the sale of the entertainment units of USA Networks to Vivendi Universal. In July, Microsoft agreed to sell its 75 percent stake in Expedia to USA Networks, which hoped to create a vacation shopping channel. Earlier this week, Vivendi Universal announced that it would acquire the television and film units of USA Networks in a deal worth more than $10 billion. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
12/18/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: A Fix For Internet Explorer	Microsoft has released a patch that fixes security flaws in its Internet Explorer browser software. The problem allowed hackers to design Web sites and e-mail messages that caused users to unknowingly download dangerous programs and ''run code of the attacker's choice,'' as the company's security bulletin put it. The patch also fixes two other problems, including one that allowed the creators of specially designed Web sites to read files on the victim's computer. ''Customers using I.E. should install the patch immediately,'' the company said. An announcement on the patch can be found at www-.microsoft.com/technet/security/ bulletin/ms01-058.asp. John Schwartz (NYT)
12/17/2001	Technology & Media; Video Game Field Becomes Crowded and Highly Profitable	While car companies, publishers and other businesses warn of a rough 2002, video game makers are preparing for their greatest year ever, fueled by the introduction of two systems promoted with hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising. After a year of unchallenged domination in the market for powerful next-generation game consoles, Sony is under assault. Nintendo and Microsoft each began selling new systems last month that will challenge Sony's PlayStation2, which already shipped more than 20 million around the world.
12/17/2001	Economy & Business; For Microsoft, a Season of Triumph	For most technology companies, the fall of 2001 was a season to forget, with its deepening sales slump, losses and layoffs. But for Microsoft, it was a time of triumph, even some vindication. In the federal antitrust case that Microsoft fought so long, with so little success, things turned in the company's favor when the Bush administration decided to settle in November. Within weeks, Microsoft announced a settlement with plaintiffs in more than 100 private class-action antitrust suits. To be sure, protests remain. Some states that sued Microsoft are urging a federal judge to toughen provisions of the settlement with the Justice Department, and there are objections to the class-action deal. A European investigation also continues, although Microsoft says it wants to settle that case as well. In all, however, Microsoft has made rapid, dramatic strides toward finally putting its antitrust troubles behind it.
12/13/2001	Online Duel: You've Got Mail, Music And More	IN the early days of America Online, it seemed you could read most of ''Ulysses'' while waiting for Chiclet-size pieces of art to arrive on your screen over a 14.4-kilobit modem connection. Time flies and has brought with it bandwidth so vast that the latest AOL software, version 7.0, delivers multimedia music and video right to your desktop with nary a moment to read the back of a Cheerios box. And then there's Microsoft: In a flurry of new offerings this fall, including an operating system overhaul and a new game console, the folks in Redmond found time to revamp their online service, MSN, with their own version 7.
12/13/2001	Skepticism In Senate Panel Over Accord With Microsoft	Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee voiced deep skepticism today about the Bush administration's proposed settlement of the antitrust case against Microsoft, as the company denounced the list of tougher penalties being sought by nine states as ''radical and punitive.'' At a brief hearing in Congress this morning, both the chairman and the ranking Republican on the committee suggested that the proposed settlement, rather than resolving the epochal litigation between the government and the company, could prompt a new round of legal proceedings because its terms were too vague and difficult to enforce.
12/11/2001	Judge Asks Further Look at Microsoft Plan for Needy Schools	A judge asked lawyers for Microsoft today whether a rival's idea for revising the company's plan to equip needy schools with computers was not a better idea. Judge J. Frederick Motz of the United States District Court said that Microsoft's proposed settlement contained ''structural biases'' that would help the company gain control of one of the few software markets where it faces vigorous competition. Microsoft offered the plan to resolve 150 lawsuits accusing it of using its Windows monopoly to overcharge consumers.
12/11/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Meeting XBOX Goals	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had shipped 1.1 million Xbox video-game consoles since their Nov. 15 release and planned to ship another 300,000 this month. The figures fall at the high end of Microsoft's forecast that it would ship 1 million to 1.5 million by the end of the year. While Microsoft did not release sales figures, Credit Suisse First Boston said Microsoft sold 182,000 Xboxes the week after Thanksgiving, with a retail price of $300, for a total of 738,000 systems since the console's introduction. Nintendo -- which began selling its GameCube, priced at $200, on Nov. 18 -- sold 65,000 systems in the same week, for a total of 534,000. Credit Suisse said sales across the game industry this quarter were exceeding forecasts. Chris Gaither (NYT)
12/10/2001	AT&T Finds Cable TV Bids Unacceptable	AT&T has reviewed the three competing bids for its cable television business, the nation's largest, and found all of them inadequate. AT&T's chairman conveyed that message to the bidders -- AOL Time Warner, Comcast and Cox Communications -- on Saturday evening, after its board spent the day considering the bids. Although the board is hoping that the response may elicit one or more sweetened offers, people close to the deliberations said, it is beginning to seem that AT&T is once again leaning toward a spinoff of its cable business into an independent company.
12/8/2001	9 States Ask Judge To Put Restrictions On Microsoft Systems	Prosecutors from nine states today criticized the Bush administration as settling too leniently with Microsoft in its antitrust case and asked a federal judge to impose a sharp set of business restrictions on the company. The state officials said that a major problem with the proposed settlement, which was reached last month, was that it failed to take back any of the gains Microsoft won from the illegal maintenance of its monopoly, and that a virtue of their proposal was that it tried to restore the competitiveness of rival companies that had been injured by Microsoft's conduct.
12/7/2001	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday about Apple Computer's objections to a Microsoft proposal to settle class-action antitrust lawsuits by donating software, computers and expertise to poor schools misstated the surname of an industry analyst at the IDC market research firm, who commented. He is Roger Kay, not Black.
12/6/2001	9 States to Ask For More Limits On Microsoft	The nine states that have refused to sign the Bush administration's proposed antitrust settlement with Microsoft will ask a Federal judge to impose tougher enforcement sanctions and eliminate a long list of loopholes from the agreement, state officials involved in the case said today. The states say such loopholes would give the company latitude to discriminate and retaliate against computer makers and software rivals.
12/5/2001	Microsoft's Latest Settlement	Microsoft's plan to give away $1 billion worth of computer technology to the nation's poorest schools is hard to attack. Nobody is against improving technological resources for needy youngsters. But it may not be a proper settlement to end class-action antitrust suits. Federal District Judge J. Frederick Motz ought to push the software company and the plaintiffs' lawyers in these cases to substantially alter the terms of the settlement. Otherwise, he should consider rejecting it. More than 100 class-action suits were filed on behalf of consumers who asserted that the company had used its monopoly in personal-computer operating systems to overcharge them for its products. Under the proposed settlement Microsoft would provide cash, training, technical support, free software and refurbished computers over five years to some 12,500 schools in low-income neighborhoods. Microsoft has been trumpeting this as a billion-dollar extension of its ''longstanding commitment to help schools make the best use of technology to improve learning.'' But if the cases proceed, Microsoft could face liabilities in excess of what it is now offering schools. The settlement's real after-tax cost to the company is closer to $375 million. The billion-dollar figure is arrived at by adding the value of some $500 million worth of free software.
12/4/2001	Microsoft Is Resisting Licensing Of Its Code	Microsoft is trying to head off demands that it give rivals licenses to use the basic code of its Windows operating systems as a way of settling antitrust action against it in Europe. In a confidential written response to the European Commission's allegations that the company had abused Windows' market dominance, Microsoft wrote that imposing compulsory licensing would violate international copyright law, according to a person with a copy of the response.
12/4/2001	Market Place; Three giants square off in the bidding for the biggest cable prize of all, AT&T Broadband.	THREE of the nation's biggest cable companies lined up yesterday in hopes of taking over the largest one, AT&T Broadband, submitting complex bids that AT&T will begin reviewing in the coming days. And Microsoft, which is already a minority stakeholder in AT&T, has indicated that it will financially support competing bids for AT&T Broadband from both the Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications in an effort to keep it out of the hands of AOL Time Warner.
12/3/2001	Microsoft Deal Worries Apple	To Apple Computer, the proposal by Microsoft and plaintiffs to settle more than 100 class-action antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft is riddled with flaws -- and carries a big competitive threat. Microsoft's proposal to donate more than $1 billion in software, computers and expertise to the nation's poorest schools would do little damage to the company's bottom line, Apple and other critics say, but would help it shore up its lead in one market it does not already dominate: education. Apple has long been a significant player in the education market for computers, though its share has been shrinking in recent years.
11/29/2001	ID, Please? Digital Wallets Are Getting Another Try	DIGITAL wallets, providing portable identification and currency for online shoppers, were often touted during the dot-com bubble as the next big thing. They never caught on, but two companies with big stakes in online commerce -- Microsoft and Sun Microsystems -- are now putting their weight behind variations on the idea. The benefits they cite are enticing: single sign-in access to multiple Web sites from any Web-connected device and faster and easier online payments. Having to remember multiple user names or passwords or retype credit card information at different sites would be a thing of the past.
11/28/2001	U.S. Judge Questions Plan For Deal in Microsoft Case	A federal judge today questioned whether Microsoft's $1 billion plan to give computers to schools to settle consumer antitrust claims would give it an unfair advantage in one of the few markets where it faces competition from Apple Computer Inc. Judge J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court asked lawyers for class-action plaintiffs who negotiated the settlement to respond to criticism from Apple, Red Hat Inc. and industry groups that allowing Microsoft to donate software and refurbished personal computers would entrench the company's monopoly in operating systems.
11/28/2001	Microsoft Move May Hasten Settlement of European Case	Offering a strong signal that it wants to settle its antitrust case in Europe, Microsoft has told the European Commission that it will forgo its right to a hearing next month, company officials and European regulators said yesterday. The move is procedural, but it could hasten the path toward settlement in Europe by allowing talks to begin earlier and avoid a possibly confrontational hearing.
11/26/2001	Game Systems Ready for Battle	With the release of Microsoft's Xbox video game console on Nov. 15 and Nintendo's GameCube three days later, the market for video game consoles is poised for a shift, but it may not be much of one. A research report released last month by Cahners In-Stat Group says that Sony, the current market leader with its PlayStation console, will sell 21 million consoles in 2002, compared with 6 million for Nintendo and 2.5 million for Microsoft.
11/22/2001	Microsoft's Top Lawyer Sets Retirement	William H. Neukom, the legal field general in Microsoft's antitrust conflicts, said yesterday that he would retire next year. His announcement came on the heels of two major settlements engineered this month by Mr. Neukom and his team --both regarded as victories for Microsoft -- and as the company's antitrust problems appear to be finally receding. Mr. Neukom -- 60, tall, silver-haired and always appearing in court in a well-tailored suit and a bow tie -- started doing legal work for Microsoft in 1979 when he was a partner in a Seattle law firm headed by the father of William H. Gates, co-founder of Microsoft. Mr. Neukom joined Microsoft in 1985 to begin its in-house legal department with one other lawyer and a paralegal. Today, the Microsoft law and corporate affairs department has 600 people, including 200 lawyers.
11/21/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Securities Firms Plan Online System	Microsoft, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney and Thomson plan to automate the process of issuing securities over the Internet, the companies said. The companies formed a venture called I-Deal L.L.C. to standardize the way operations like raising capital and issuing stock are carried out. Terms of ownership were not disclosed.
11/21/2001	Microsoft Aims To Settle Suits By Equipping 12,500 Schools	Microsoft filed a proposal in federal court yesterday that could remove another of its legal headaches: more than 100 class-action antitrust suits contending that it overcharged consumers. The proposed deal is an innovative approach because the proceeds would not go to the customers who say they were overcharged but to more than 12,500 schools in low-income neighborhoods around the country. Under the terms of the deal, Microsoft would be required to provide cash, training and support to help put computing services into disadvantaged schools with nearly seven million students. The five-year program would cost Microsoft at least $550 million and possibly far more. The deal is championed by a pair of leading class-action lawyers, Stanley M. Chesley of Cincinnati and Michael D. Hausfeld of Washington.
11/21/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Portuguese TV Venture Stalls	The chairman of PT Multimedia, the Portugal Telecom unit that began the first interactive TV service using Microsoft software, said the company would delay expansion of the service because of technical glitches. PT Multimedia's TV Cabo is the world's first cable network to provide interactive television over a broadband network using the Microsoft system. Just two weeks ago, Charter Communications, a St. Louis-based cable television company, said it would offer products based on the Microsoft software to as many as a million of its customers for the next seven years. Jamie Hoelscher, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said that since the company was still testing the TV system, the problems in Portugal would have no effect on its plans. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
11/15/2001	For Musicians, Microsoft's Xbox Is No Jackpot	Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country.
11/14/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo To Feature Paid Search Results	Yahoo, by far the biggest search engine on the Internet, said it would display listings from sites that pay money ahead of sites that were chosen by its editors. The paid listings will be provided by Overture Services, formerly GoTo.com, which has similar arrangements with America Online, Lycos and parts of Microsoft's MSN. Overture runs an auction among advertising sites, which bid how much they will pay each time users click on the link to their site; those that offer the largest payments are listed first. On Yahoo, the five top-paying sites will be listed first, in a section called ''sponsored matches'' above its other listings. The deal will last for six months, after which Yahoo will decide if it will sell its own paid listings or continue using those from Overture. Neither company would discuss the financial terms of the deal. In Overture's deal with AOL, it agreed to share the revenue from the listings with a minimum of $50 million over 18 months. Yahoo is under enormous pressure to find new sources of revenue to replace advertising from Internet companies. It is holding an analyst meeting Thursday to detail its plans for investors. Saul Hansell (NYT)
11/13/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Loss Widens At WEBMD	The WebMD Corporation, which makes medical practice management software, said yesterday that its third-quarter loss widened after it wrote down the value of acquisitions by $3.83 billion. The company, based in Elmwood, N.J., had a loss of $4.62 billion, or $12.86 a share, compared with a loss of $786.9 million, or $3.17, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $167 million, from $151.2 million. The company also canceled a technology agreement with Microsoft. Under the pact, WebMD would have used Microsoft software in its systems that help doctors run their offices. WebMD expects 2002 revenue of $730 million to $750 million. Shares rose 36 cents, to $4.90.
11/13/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: AOL And Sony In Venture	AOL Time Warner and the Sony Corporation of Japan announced yesterday that they had agreed to cooperate to develop advanced digital entertainment technologies and services. The pact joins AOL, a large media company, with Sony, a big maker of electronic devices. The statement included few specifics, but perhaps the most intriguing aspect of yesterday's deal was the announcement that the companies intended to develop an Internet browser, posing a potential challenge to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. AOL controls Netscape, a browser pioneer that has lost ground to Microsoft. Seth Schiesel (NYT)
11/12/2001	Windows XP Seems to Have Solid Start	The early sales for Windows XP, given the economic climate, appear to be good -- not a runaway hit perhaps, but very solid. In the first three days after its introduction on Oct. 25, Windows XP sold more than 300,000 copies in retail stores, according to NPD Intelect Market Tracking, a research firm. That is well ahead of the inaugural three-day total of about 200,000 for Windows Millennium Edition in September 2000, according to NPD estimates, but below the 400,000 copies of Windows 98 sold in its first three days, in 1998.
11/11/2001	Investing; Can Xbox Electrify Microsoft Suppliers?	AS Microsoft enters the video game market with the release of its Xbox console on Thursday, some investors are placing their bets on allied companies like Flextronics, which is manufacturing the Xbox console, and Nvidia, which provides the graphics chip for the unit. To meet sales estimates of 1 million to 1.5 million game players before the end of the year, Microsoft is moving well beyond its normal marketing channels. The Xbox release includes cross-promotions with partners like Taco Bell and MTV.
11/9/2001	It's Still a Safe World for Microsoft	Four years almost to the day after the government first sued Microsoft for violating the terms of its antitrust settlement, the United States ended its prosecution of Microsoft with another proposed settlement. This consent decree is weaker than the one Microsoft had apparently agreed to before a United States Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the finding of liability against the company last summer. Some may wonder how you get a better deal after being found guilty than you did before. But the test of this agreement is not whether it is stronger or weaker than the last. The test is whether it will work. And while the core idea of this agreement is a good one, the execution plainly is not.
11/8/2001	Console Shootout: The Sequel	THIS month two new game consoles make their debut, and their differences are apparent before you even take them out of the box. When I received Microsoft's Xbox in the mail, I looked at the package and thought, can it really be this big? A few days later, when the mailman dropped off Nintendo's GameCube, I wondered, can it really fit inside this little box? The Xbox and the GameCube are the most powerful game consoles to date and they will be introduced within three days of each other (the Xbox on Nov. 15, the GameCube on Nov. 18), yet they represent entirely different strategies. Microsoft, new to the world of console gaming, enters the arena with a roar, while Nintendo, the seasoned veteran, saunters in whistling with the confidence of someone with nothing to prove.
11/8/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Product Selected By Charter	A St. Louis-based cable television company, Charter Communications, said it would use Microsoft software to deliver interactive programming and Internet services to up to a million cable customers the next seven years. The deployment will start next year in St. Louis. Financial terms were not announced. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in a drive to replicate in digital TV software the success it has achieved with its Windows operating system in personal computers. The software is already in use in Portugal and, under the Ultimate TV name, by customers of DirecTV, a satellite TV company. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)
11/7/2001	Judge to Hear From 9 States On Microsoft	A federal district judge said today that she would hold a pair of separate but related proceedings early next year to consider the proposed antitrust settlement between the Bush administration and Microsoft and to hear arguments by a group of states that officially broke ranks with the federal government in search of tougher penalties. The order by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of United States District Court in Washington followed the announcement this afternoon that nine states involved in the case, led by New York, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, had decided to join the Bush administration's settlement after it was slightly revised in negotiations that concluded at about 3:30 this morning.
11/7/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Search Engine Expands	The top-ranked Internet search engine Google has expanded its index to include material in Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and other business and academic file formats linked from Web pages. The move augments Google's February 2001 addition of Adobe Portable Document Format, or P.D.F., files and brings the search engine's non-Web document total to 35 million. A Google spokesman, David Krane, said P.D.F.'s now account for 22 million of those documents, up from 10 million in February. Google converts these indexed documents to Web pages that can be viewed with standard browsers via a link on its search results pages. Google also now indexes the text of files formatted as PostScript, Rich Text Format, Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPro, and MacWrite, as well as the WordStar 2000 format. Glenn Fleishman (NYT)
11/6/2001	U.S. and Some States Split on Microsoft, Risking New Delay	The 18 states involved in the Microsoft antitrust case appeared headed for a sharp split today, with one group of attorneys general planning to sign onto the proposed settlement between the software giant and the Bush administration and another group preparing to challenge it, saying it leaves loopholes that would undermine provisions intended to promote competition. After three days of intensive deliberations, only one state attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly of Massachusetts, officially announced his position. He said Massachusetts would seek to block the deal, concluding that it ''may prove to be more harmful than helpful to competition and consumers.''
11/6/2001	Europeans Unmoved by U.S. Proposal	Microsoft is no nearer to resolving its antitrust problems in Europe than it was before Friday's proposed settlement with the United States Justice Department, a spokeswoman at the European Commission here said today. ''We will be studying the settlement with interest, but we can't say what implications it will have on the European antitrust case yet,'' said the commission's competition spokeswoman, Amelia Torres.
11/5/2001	Helping Software Companies Be as Open as They Want to Be	THE standard picture of the software industry in recent years has been big, secretive companies like Microsoft at one extreme and the collaborative approach of the open source movement at the other. But now open source is actually changing how many software companies do their work -- up to a point. You could call it greater openness behind closed doors. Even at Microsoft, where, earlier this year, a top executive denounced open source as a threat to intellectual property, software developers say they see the value in open source's emphasis on collaborative work.
11/5/2001	States Weigh Going It Alone In Legal Battle With Microsoft	As they neared a deadline to accept or reject the proposed antitrust agreement between Microsoft and the Bush administration, a group of state prosecutors spent the weekend fielding growing complaints about the deal from scores of industry executives, technology experts and consumer groups. After a round of cross-country teleconferences, the attorneys general from 18 states decided to continue their discussions on Monday. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia has asked the states to inform her of their decision on Tuesday morning.
11/5/2001	Settling the Microsoft Case	Though sensible, the terms of the settlement agreement put forth by the Justice Department and Microsoft to end their epic antitrust battle will disappoint many. The deal would modify Microsoft's behavior to a lesser degree than its competitors would like. It is a triumph for the company, a violator of the nation's antitrust laws, when compared with the structural remedy, long favored by this page and ordered last year by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. That would have broken the company in two, with one entity focused on the Windows operating system and the other on software applications. The settlement now awaiting Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's approval, as well as that of 18 states that have also sued the company, flows naturally from a unanimous opinion last June from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court threw out Judge Jackson's breakup order and narrowed the scope of Microsoft's liability, making it far from certain that prosecutors could obtain tougher remedies than those contained in the settlement. Moreover, the settlement imposes immediate obligations on Microsoft to ensure competition in the development of new software and lifts a great deal of legal uncertainty from much of the technology sector.
11/4/2001	Reckonings; Making Windows Transparent	Anyone who has spent time trying to make sense of the Microsoft issue realizes that this is one case in which the cliché is true: there are no good answers, and all one can do is try to choose the lesser of several evils. I like the apparent settlement reached last week better than I liked the solution that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson tried to impose last year, but I would be the first to admit that this answer has its own problems. As it happens, my own minor travails in the course of writing a textbook seem to illustrate in a small way why this problem is so hard to solve, and why the settlement, if the states go along with it, might nonetheless do some good.
11/4/2001	Microsoft Explores A New Territory: Fun	DEEP in the wine cellar of the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo one evening last month, two dozen of Europe's top video game publishers, along with some American rivals, gathered to toast the Xbox, the newest machine that will run their games. Surrounded by Napoleonic vintages, they dined at the invitation of the game's creator, the Microsoft Corporation, which stands little chance of succeeding in the $20 billion market without their games to propel sales. One American, Sherry McKenna, who had migrated from the film business to Oddworld Inhabitants, a small development studio in California, typified what they had at stake. Oddworld had scrapped plans to make its next game for Sony's PlayStation2 in favor of the Xbox, tying its future to Microsoft's success in video games. She has doubts, though, about Microsoft's marketing approach.
11/3/2001	The Law of Computer Evolution and the Law of the Land	Yesterday, the two parties in United States v. Microsoft reached a compromise that could bring the three-year-old case to an end. But nothing will undo the conclusion that Microsoft used monopoly power in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In fact, the proposed compromise could have a significant effect on how Microsoft conducts its business. But I believe that this compromise and the judicial consensus lying behind it are based on a mistaken view of technological innovation and an even more mistaken view of how computers are used. The conclusions depend on two flawed assertions; both will survive this case and both will have as yet unforeseen consequences.
11/3/2001	U.S. and Microsoft in Deal, but States Hold Back	Microsoft and the federal government, long bitter legal enemies, walked into a federal court together today and announced that they had settled their epic antitrust dispute. State prosecutors who had filed a parallel antitrust lawsuit declined for now to endorse the deal and persuaded a federal judge to give them until early next week to formulate a response. Outlining the details of the proposed settlement publicly for the first time, the Justice Department and Microsoft described a set of business restrictions that appeared to fall considerably short of what the judge who tried the case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, tried to impose on Microsoft last year. The company had already adopted some of those restrictions last summer after it was found to have engaged in illegal monopolistic practices.
11/2/2001	Antitrust Deal Is Called Big Victory for Microsoft	After more than three years of litigation, repeated courtroom setbacks and failed settlement talks, Microsoft is apparently on the verge of emerging largely successful from its long antitrust battle. Microsoft's tentative agreement with the Justice Department would not require it to alter the design or development of its products and would not change its strategy of aggressively moving into new markets. To be sure, uncertainties remain for Microsoft. The 18 states that joined the Justice Department in the suit may bolt from the settlement. The European Commission has a broad investigation of the big software maker under way, and Brussels may well prove less malleable than the Bush administration.
11/2/2001	States Biding for Time to Study Microsoft Settlement Plan	The 18 states involved in the government's landmark antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft rebuffed repeated requests today by Microsoft and the Justice Department to join the tentative settlement they reached a day earlier. Concluding a series of meetings in Washington and cross-country telephone calls, the state prosecutors instead agreed among themselves to ask the federal judge overseeing the case for time to examine the details of the proposed deal.
11/1/2001	Justice Department and Microsoft Are Seen in Tentative Settlement	The Justice Department and the Microsoft Corporation have reached a tentative agreement to settle the long-running antitrust suit against the company, people involved in the talks said today. The proposed agreement, some details of which were being resolved late this evening, was presented by Charles A. James, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, to a group of state attorneys general meeting in Washington for their consideration. In meetings expected to last through the evening, the state officials were pressing the Bush administration to impose tougher conditions on Microsoft than it had proposed. State officials were also assessing whether they would agree to a deal or break with the Justice Department and try to upset the preliminary agreement.
11/1/2001	Lyrics for Windows	To the Editor: So Bill Gates launches Windows XP with a big corporate presentation in Times Square and a free concert by Sting in Bryant Park. In the 90's he paid the Rolling Stones big bucks for the rights to their hit ''Start Me Up'' for the launch of Windows 95 (which coincided with the advent of the Start button).
10/29/2001	After an Online Ruckus, Microsoft Opens MSN Site to All	Microsoft had a big day last Thursday as it not only introduced its new Windows XP operating system but also upgraded its flagship Web site, MSN.com. Windows XP and its coming-out party in New York got rave reviews, yet the MSN move prompted an outcry. The problem, it seemed, was that the altered Microsoft site, dubbed MSN 7, treated some Internet browsers as second-class citizens, even preventing users with certain browsers from viewing the site.
10/26/2001	The Unveiling of Windows XP	Microsoft, the software giant that manages to be one of America's most successful and most controversial corporations, is introducing its latest operating system this week. Unlike the debut of Windows 95 six years ago, the appearance of Windows XP hasn't turned into a national event. The subdued reaction says a good deal about the changed state of the computer business. The information age has matured a lot since 1995. What most excites Windows XP's admirers is not so much its vivid graphics or the ease with which it handles digital photography, music and video. The biggest selling point cited by many reviewers is that Windows XP rarely crashes, unlike Microsoft's earlier operating systems, especially those used mostly by individual consumers. Microsoft gingerly acknowledges Windows XP's ''stability,'' while trying to avoid overtly damning older versions of Windows.
10/26/2001	Microsoft Introduces New Operating System	With a concert by the rock singer Sting and the personal thanks of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Microsoft yesterday introduced its Windows XP operating system, a product that carries the hopes of reviving sales for the beleaguered personal computer industry. The new operating system arrives amid fresh signs that the sides in the Microsoft antitrust case remain far apart, even as they are in settlement talks with a court-ordered deadline of Nov. 2.
10/25/2001	Driving Windows XP to Market	After his sophomore year at Stanford University, Chris Jones showed up at Microsoft for a summer job in 1989 and was escorted to an office with a personal computer running MS-DOS, the operating system that helped make Microsoft the dominant PC software company. Mr. Jones sat down, turned on the machine and stared at the dark screen illuminated only by the MS-DOS command line, a cryptic C: that required the user to type in a series of programming commands to make the computer do anything useful.
10/25/2001	Windows of Opportunity	Bill Gates comes to New York today to tout the wonders of Microsoft's new operating system, Windows XP. To hear him talk, Windows XP will improve our lives in almost every way. What he'll talk less about, I suspect, is how Windows XP will advance Microsoft's domination over the world of personal computing. Then again, he may see the goals as identical. Certainly Windows XP will improve the experience for the average user of a personal computer. For your $199, your computer will become somewhat faster and markedly more stable. Based on the code from Windows 2000, which is an industrial-strength system marketed to corporate America, Windows XP is sturdier all around than its consumer-class predecessor, Windows ME. With Windows XP you'll be able to edit home videos, share digital photographs and make your own music CD's without having to buy extra software. These new features may well cause dismay among smaller companies that sell such programs as stand-alone products.
10/24/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Online Services Agree To Ratings	Some of the biggest companies in the online world said they would take part in a voluntary labeling system to help parents shield children from online content, like nudity, the parents find objectionable. AOL Time Warner, Yahoo and the Microsoft Network voiced support for the Internet Content Ratings Association, which promotes the worldwide adoption of tools for blocking sites that are included in the major Internet browser programs. The group says it offers an alternative to government regulation. Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, applauded the efforts, but said parents should use sites like www.getnetwise.org to see the full range of options. ''We don't think there's a one-size-fits-all strategy,'' he said. John Schwartz (NYT)
10/23/2001	Programmer Exposes Microsoft Flaws	In the latest skirmish between code breakers and digital copyright holders, an anonymous programmer has published software on the Internet that disables Microsoft technology that is designed to regulate what consumers do with music they purchase online. The Microsoft technology is an important piece of the company's efforts to profit from what is a nascent but potentially lucrative market for selling music and video material over the Internet. But Microsoft said yesterday that the security of the music sheathed in its software would not be seriously jeopardized..
10/23/2001	Bowdlerized by Microsoft	I was hard at the grindstone, crusading against hypocrisy and chaos, armed with my laptop and Microsoft Word 2000. I'd just typed: ''Only a fool would believe.'' But ''fool'' did not seem right. So I hit Shift-F7 to call up the thesaurus. The lone synonym that Word provided was a verb: trick. Where were the nouns? Where was idiot? I typed ''idiot,'' hit Shift-F7, and got the message ''not found.'' Then I tried goon. Again, not found. No luck with ninny, nincompoop or numbskull. Or with nitwit, halfwit, dimwit or twit. Or dullard, dunce or dolt.
10/19/2001	Microsoft's Profit Report Beats Wall St. Estimates	Microsoft reported quarterly profits yesterday that surpassed Wall Street's expectations -- ignoring, as most securities analysts do, a big charge for bad investments in telecommunications and cable-television companies. And Microsoft executives delivered an optimistic outlook for the company's prospects, despite further weakening in the economy and the personal computer business in the aftermath of terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Microsoft executives attributed the strong quarterly results to sales of software that runs big data-serving computers in corporate networks and other products beyond its traditional mainstay of operating system software for desktop computers.
10/18/2001	XP's 'Time Bomb'	To the Editor: The copy-protection scheme for Windows XP that you describe in ''Dear User: This Bootleg Copy Will Self-Destruct in 30 Days'' (Sept. 6) appears identical to the notorious ''challenge response'' system utilized by some software manufacturers in the Mac world. The problem is that a protection system tied to changes to hardware (or system software as well, in the case of the Mac) doesn't take into account the vagaries of real world usage. In Italy, far from e-mail or a phone, I once found an important piece of protected software not working because I had done a routine maintenance chore the day before.
10/17/2001	Bowing to Nation's Mood, Retailer Cancels Issue of Racy Catalog	Abercrombie & Fitch, the apparel retailer known for campaigns that celebrate the pulchritude and pleasures of youth, will announce today that it has canceled the holiday issue of its quarterly publication because the content and tone were deemed inappropriate after the Sept. 11 attacks. The cancellation of the high-profile publication, known as the A & F Quarterly, is thought to be the first instance since the attacks in which an advertiser has scrapped a big planned marketing effort poised to be printed. But other companies have also been forced to alter campaigns and promotions as they struggle to strike the right balance for advertising in the last five weeks.
10/16/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Regulators Talk To Microsoft	The European Commission said yesterday that although it had talked informally with Microsoft about its latest operating platform, XP, the agency was not conducting a formal investigation. Microsoft invited the commission to comment on XP in May. The European competition regulator has submitted questions and the company has replied, a commission spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said. Paul Meller (NYT)
10/15/2001	Final Tests Are Negative For 4 Workers In Reno Office	Four people who were tested for exposure to anthrax from a letter sent to a Microsoft office in Reno have received clean bills of health, county health officials said today. Preliminary results on two other people who may have been exposed to the letter were also negative, said the Washoe County health officials, who were still awaiting the results of tests from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to determine whether the strain of anthrax found in the envelope was one that may cause illness. Five Microsoft workers and a relative of one were tested.
10/14/2001	Anthrax Reports Widen, but No Link Is Found	Officials in New York, Florida and Nevada reported new incidents or information involving anthrax yesterday, heightening concerns nationwide but demonstrating no links among the cases. In New York, investigators announced that they had located the source of the anthrax that sickened one, and perhaps two, NBC employees at Rockefeller Center: a letter mailed to the television network from Trenton on Sept. 18.
10/14/2001	Envelope Sent to an Office in Reno Contained Anthrax, Governor Says	A piece of mail received by a Microsoft office in Reno contained anthrax, the governor of Nevada said today, making this the third known location involving anthrax contamination in the United States. None of the six people who touched the envelope or were nearby when it was opened on Friday in an office of Microsoft Licensing in Reno are known to be infected, the governor, Kenny Guinn, said at a news conference today in Carson City.
10/13/2001	Letter Returned To an Office Is Being Tested	Nevada state officials said today that a suspicious letter mailed to a Microsoft office in Reno earlier this week might have contained anthrax. The officials said that a first test for anthrax proved positive but that a subsequent test showed no traces of anthrax and that a third more decisive test was expected to be concluded on Saturday morning.
10/13/2001	No Settlement by Deadline In Microsoft Antitrust Case	Microsoft and the government have failed to settle the long-running antitrust case on their own, and a federal judge is expected to name a mediator to handle further negotiations early next week, a person close to the talks said yesterday. Representatives from Microsoft, the Justice Department and 18 states who joined the suit informed Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the stalemate in a conference call yesterday.
10/13/2001	SEGA, GAMES DEVELOPER, ADDS TO MICROSOFT DEAL	The Sega Corporation, the creator of the Sonic the Hedgehog game character, said it would develop two more games for Microsoft's Xbox game console, extending an alliance the two companies formed in March. Sega, which scrapped its own Dreamcast console earlier this year because of poor sales, said it would develop Shenmue II and Phantasy Star Online for Xbox. The games will be developed by two Sega units devoted to software design. With the additional games, Sega, which is based in Tokyo, is now developing 13 titles for the Xbox, Microsoft's first foray into the $20 billion video game industry. Sega, which has lost money the last four years, has shifted gears this year, getting out of the hardware business and focusing on software design for its own game library and for companies like Sony and Nintendo. Xbox will make its debut in the United States on Nov. 15 at $299.
10/11/2001	Loading Up the Discs For the Big Move to XP	With the nagging fear of leaving important things behind, moving to a new computer can be just as stressful as moving to a new house. To help ease the pain, the Iomega Corporation released a free program this week called the Iomega Moving Kit, which is designed to help users trading up to brand-new Windows XP computers. Using the utility requires an Iomega Zip, Jaz or Peerless drive and enough disks to hold the amount of data to be moved. The migration tool will record and copy the user's customized Windows preferences, like font and folder options, and application information and e-mail settings. Data like documents, images, movies and music files can also be easily transferred to the new machine.
10/11/2001	Microsoft Denies It Tried to Hinder Inquiry	The Microsoft Corporation denied today that it misled the European Commission in its antitrust investigation into the company. The Wall Street Journal, citing a confidential European Commission document outlining the case, reported today that antitrust regulators might seek a large fine from Microsoft and demand that it drop some features from its Windows software. The report also said the commission contended that Microsoft misled investigators and sought to obstruct the case.
10/11/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Backs Groove Networks	Microsoft has invested $51 million in Groove Networks, the peer-to-peer communications company started by Ray Ozzie. The investment gives Microsoft a minority equity stake in the company, and the two companies also said they would work together to promote Internet-based services to businesses. ''Microsoft's investment in Groove Networks indicates just how important this relationship is to both companies,'' said Mr. Ozzie, above, the creator of the popular business communications tool Lotus Notes and Groove's chief executive. Groove's software, which has been described as Napster for office workers, relies on technology that lets groups of workers share data and files online. Microsoft's .NET initiative also emphasizes such distributed computing. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
10/11/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Venture To Make Products For Doctors	The drug maker Pfizer Inc. joined I.B.M. and Microsoft yesterday to announce the official start of Amicore, an independent software and services company that aims to provide office automation products to doctors. The company named Jim Fitzsimmons as president and chief executive and said it had acquired a Connecticut health care software developer, the PenChart Corporation. Amicore enters an already competitive market. WebMD, one of the first companies to try to link doctors and insurance providers over the Web, has not been able to turn a profit, losing more than $800 million in the quarter ended June 30. WebMD and a competing alliance of insurance companies called MedUnite have encountered hurdles in their attempts to streamline the health care industry by linking various participants on the Net. Susan Stellin (NYT)
10/11/2001	Browser Battle: Beyond the Numbers	IN the old days, software companies used a simple numbering scheme. Upon the release of a major overhaul of a program, the version number changed -- for example, from FileMaker 3 to FileMaker 4. When the changes involved only a few features, the number after the decimal point changed, as from Word 5 to Word 5.1. And when bugs were fixed, we got the double-decimal-point upgrade, as from Linux 2.4.1 to 2.4.2. You could gauge the magnitude of the improvements just by looking at the number. In the last few weeks Microsoft and Netscape each released new versions of their free Web browsers, but the version numbers couldn't be more misleading. Only a few touch-ups differentiate Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 (for Windows) from version 5.5. On the other hand, Netscape 6.1 (for Windows, Macintosh and Linux) is a radical leap forward from last year's appalling Netscape 6.0.
10/10/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Chip Maker Joins XP Campaign	Microsoft and Advanced Micro Devices said they had agreed to jointly market products that share the XP name. Officials of Microsoft, whose Windows XP operating system goes on sale Oct. 25, appeared at a news conference yesterday to promote Advanced Micro's newest microprocessor, Athlon XP. The companies said they would work together to train retail clerks about the performance of Windows XP running on Athlon XP, to create promotions for computer distributors and to organize events aimed at consumers and small-business owners. John Frederiksen, general manager of Microsoft's PC Experience group, said his engineers had worked hard to maximize the performance of Windows XP on Athlon. But he added that they did the same for chips made by Advanced Micro's larger rival, Intel. ''We want Windows everywhere,'' he said. Chris Gaither (NYT)
10/10/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Alters Licensing Program	Responding to an outcry from some of its largest customers, Microsoft announced changes to the controversial new volume licensing program it began rolling out the first week of October. The most notable change is an extension of the customer deadline for upgrading to the program, called Software Assurance. Customers now have until July 31, 2002, rather than Feb. 28, 2002, to become ''current'' on Microsoft Windows, Office and other Microsoft software titles they use, a requirement for participation in Software Assurance. At the same time, Microsoft said customers running Office 2000 would not be forced to upgrade to the new Office XP to be eligible. Microsoft has faced a chorus of complaints since it announced the upgrade program in May 2001, mainly from corporate customers buying software in volume, who say the licensing program will sharply increase their upgrade costs. Microsoft, which views the new program as an important step toward its model of offering software as a service rather than a product, estimates that only 20 percent of customers will have a cost increase. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
10/10/2001	Supreme Court Rejects Microsoft Appeal	The Supreme Court yesterday rejected a request by the Microsoft Corporation to consider throwing out the government's landmark antitrust lawsuit because of the misconduct of a federal district judge. Following its customary practice, the court issued its decision without comment. Microsoft's appeal to the court to dismiss the findings of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court in the District of Columbia had been widely viewed as a long shot. The company had said it might still pursue an appeal of the findings to the Supreme Court, prompting the government to urge the court to reject a piecemeal approach to the appeal.
10/5/2001	The Microsoft Conundrum	Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly invoked both national purpose and practical reason last Friday as she ordered the two sides in the Microsoft antitrust case to return to the negotiating table one last time. The ''recent tragic events,'' she said, lent an added urgency to resolving the issue, given its importance to the national economy. A settlement can surely be reached ''if everybody is reasonable'' and ''acts in good faith,'' the judge declared. Those are fine sentiments, but the two sides still see the case so differently. Judge Kollar-Kotelly, of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, acknowledged that problem when she thanked Microsoft and the Justice Department, joined by 18 states, for cooperating to file a joint status report. ''You didn't agree on a lot,'' she said, ''but it was joint.''
10/4/2001	A New Crop Of Palmtops With Roots In the PC	TODAY is a big day for hand-held computing nuts. It marks the release of Pocket PC 2002, Microsoft's next-generation operating system for pocket computers, as well as the debut of several palmtops that run it. Their makers -- Compaq, Toshiba and Hewlett-Packard -- have much to celebrate: they have succeeded in thinking small. But Microsoft continues to think big, which is not always a good thing in machines with three-inch screens. The Compaq iPaq once held the crown for the industry's best color screen. Now every Pocket PC maker uses the same reflective TFT technology, which looks spectacular both indoors and in direct sunlight. You don't see many nerds in bars these days, but if you did, surely they'd show off their family snapshots on these palmtops instead of wallets.
10/1/2001	Microsoft Customers Balk At Automatic Upgrades	A new software licensing program from Microsoft that goes into effect this week has some corporate customers complaining that they will end paying more and buying upgrades they do not need. As of Oct. 1, Microsoft is changing the way large customers buy software programs in volume. Rather than choosing when they want to upgrade to a new version, corporate customers will be required to purchase maintenance contracts that will essentially determine what upgrades they buy.
9/29/2001	Judge Orders Talks to Settle Microsoft Case	A federal judge today ordered Microsoft and the government into a new round of intensive negotiations to settle the long-running antitrust case. Should talks fail, she indicated, the company faces the prospect of a quick series of hearings next spring to enable her to fashion a tough and broad penalty. The judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, gave the lawyers two weeks to achieve a deal on their own. If they fail to reach a deal, she said, she would then appoint a mediator of their choosing and require them to report back to her every 10 days on the progress of the talks. She set a Nov. 2 deadline for the negotiations to end.
9/29/2001	Microsoft Talks Ordered by Judge	A federal judge has ordered Microsoft and the government to start a new round of negotiations to settle the long-running antitrust case. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly gave the lawyers two weeks to reach a deal on their own. If they fail to reach a deal, she said, she would appoint a mediator and require them to report back to her every 10 days on the progress of the talks.
9/27/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Adds A Lawyer	Microsoft hired a prominent trial lawyer, Daniel K. Webb, in preparation for a new court battle with government antitrust enforcers over its Windows monopoly. Mr. Webb, 56, a former United States attorney in Chicago and the lead prosecutor in the Iran-contra trial of John Poindexter, the former national security adviser, will join the trial team in Microsoft's fight with the Justice Department and 18 states. Mr. Webb successfully defended General Electric in 1994 from charges it conspired to fix the price of industrial diamonds. The case was dismissed after prosecutors had presented their evidence in trial.
9/27/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Amazon Starts A Travel Venture	Getting into what, until two weeks ago, was the hottest area of the Internet, Amazon.com introduced a department where its shoppers can book travel and buy travel-related merchandise. Mainly, the section includes links to reservations from Expedia.com, the big travel site controlled by Microsoft. It also has links to Hotwire.com, which offers heavily restricted discount tickets, and tour packages from the National Leisure Group. Amazon was set to unveil the section two weeks ago, but put off its debut in the aftermath of the terrorist attack and subsequent falloff in travel. Analysts said Expedia will pay Amazon some fees in return for sending it customers, but the effect on both companies' financial results is expected to be modest. Amazon shares fell 74 cents, or 10.4 percent, to $6.35. Saul Hansell (NYT)
9/26/2001	Sun Online ID Set to Compete With Microsoft	Sun Microsystems is expected to announce an online identification initiative today, presenting it as an alternative to Microsoft's Passport system. The effort, called Liberty, will revolve around software developed by Sun that can be freely used by other companies, according to an executive close to the company.
9/26/2001	Why E-Mail Is Creating Multiple E-Personalities	JEFF BEZOS, the chief executive of Amazon.com, has an approach to e-mail that his corporate peers might consider insane. He has made his e-mail address public -- jeff@amazon.com -- and says that he reads every message that appears in his box. It's true, insisted Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman. Of course, ''he doesn't respond personally to everything,'' Mr. Curry said. ''He used to be able to. But his goal now is to read everything and respond where he can.'' When he doesn't send an answer himself, others in his office, who also check his e-mail account, try to do so.
9/25/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: British Companies Challenge Microsoft	A consor tium of British companies have complained to regulators about a Microsoft pricing policy, which they say will cost business an additional ?880 million, or $1.3 billion. The group, called the Infrastructure Forum, which includes GlaxoSmithKline, Prudential and Cadbury Schweppes, as well as the BBC and Inland Revenue, wrote last week to Patricia Hewitt, the secretary of trade, to protest the new structure. Instead of allowing companies to upgrade existing software, Microsoft is asking customers to sign up for a three-year subscription, in which they would pay an initial sum and then purchase new software as it is released. A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said Ms. Hewitt would review the group's concerns. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)
9/22/2001	Microsoft Delays Release of Xbox Game System by a Week	The Microsoft Corporation, following a pattern of delays and shortfalls by the makers of video game consoles, yesterday postponed by one week the North American release of its Xbox game system. The company, a newcomer to the console industry, said it still planned to ship a million to 1.5 million consoles by the end of the holiday season. But retailers said they expected to receive about half the 600,000 to 800,000 consoles promised for the first day, which is now Nov. 15 instead of Nov. 8.
9/21/2001	Microsoft Seeks a Long Penalty Process	The government today proposed a schedule for the remaining proceedings in the Microsoft antitrust case that by taking years to conclude could have limited effect on the company's new operating system. Antitrust prosecutors, in papers filed in United States District Court here, asked that hearings to determine how to penalize Microsoft begin in February, more than three months after the introduction of the operating system, Windows XP. Microsoft has denied accusations by rivals and critics that Windows XP, by integrating many different computer applications, presents even more antitrust problems than the earlier versions of the operating system that were at issue in the lawsuit.
9/20/2001	Awww, That's Cute Enough To Frame (With a TV Screen)	The Hobbesian choice between watching television at your friend's house or looking at baby pictures at your friend's house has finally been resolved. Thanks to Microsoft, you can look at baby pictures on the television at your friend's house. Microsoft's $159 TV Photo Viewer is a new piece of hardware that displays digital images on the TV screen. The accompanying software loads images onto standard 3.5-inch diskettes. The diskette can then be loaded into the TV Photo Viewer, which is attached by cable to the television, where the images can be displayed for your viewing pleasure.
9/20/2001	Microsoft's Passport Sign-On System Will Work on Rival Sites	Microsoft will announce today that it plans to open up its online identification system to make it compatible with competing offerings under development by companies like America Online and others. The move comes after criticism from privacy groups, competitors and some industry analysts that Microsoft's identification system, called Passport, could result in the company's holding a trove of personal information on many millions of people and give Microsoft a dominant role in Internet commerce.
9/20/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Worm's Spread Is Said To Slow	The incidence of infection by a powerful new computer worm appeared to slow yesterday, but security experts warned that there might be ongoing effects. The malicious program, known as the Nimda Worm, emerged on Tuesday, spreading to tens of thousands of computers and exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft software, according to the Computer Emergency Response Team. The CERT Coordination Center, based at Carnegie Mellon University, warned that the worm included code that would try to resend infected e-mail messages every 10 days. In addition, the worm is designed to render infected computers vulnerable to remote access so online intruders may view or alter files on those machines, security experts said. But the experts said the worm was such an enormous piece of computer code that they had not yet fully assessed it. Matt Richtel (NYT)
9/16/2001	Private Sector; In Antitrust, Stress on Restraint	SITTING on the coffee table in his spacious office at the Justice Department, next to a stack of newspapers, are ''The Art of War'' and ''Who Moved My Cheese?'' -- two books that Charles A. James says provide vital insights for his job as the nation's top antitrust enforcer. ''The lesson of 'The Art of War' is that a dispassionate solution and all tactical decisions flow from a realistic assessment of where you are, and if you don't do that initial assessment right, you'll make mistakes,'' Mr. James said last Monday, referring to the book by the ancient military strategist Sun Tzu. ''And the lesson of 'Who Moved My Cheese?' is that you have to be open to change in all of your planning because life is constantly changing.''
9/9/2001	The Nation; U.S. vs. Microsoft: Going Back to Square One	IT was a jarring juxtaposition. As the Bush administration decided last week to abandon the government's plan to break up Microsoft for a raft of antitrust violations, Bill Gates, the company's co-founder and chairman, was saying that the case had had no impact over the way the company designed its products or conducted its affairs. ''There's been no interference from the lawsuit in terms of Microsoft pushing its innovation forward,'' Mr. Gates told The Washington Post. ''I doubt there will be that interference because the laws do and should encourage innovation.''
9/8/2001	Many Microsofts Weren't the Answer	To the Editor: There is one piece of logic in the case against Microsoft that doesn't bear up under scrutiny: the charge that Microsoft be barred from including ''many applications'' in its product (''U.S. Abandoning Its Effort to Break Apart Microsoft, Saying It Seeks Resolution,'' front page, Sept. 7).
9/8/2001	Many Microsofts Weren't the Answer	To the Editor: Re ''U.S. Abandoning Its Effort to Break Apart Microsoft, Saying It Seeks Resolution'' (front page, Sept. 7):
9/8/2001	States Press U.S. to Take Tough Stand On Microsoft	Some of the leading state attorneys general in the Microsoft antitrust case said yesterday that they would press for tough sanctions against the software maker, including ones that apply to the company's new operating system, Windows XP. The states also served notice that they were willing to break with the Bush administration and pursue Microsoft on their own if they think the steps the Justice Department is to suggest do not go far enough to foster competition in the software industry.
9/7/2001	U.S. ABANDONING ITS EFFORT TO BREAK APART MICROSOFT, SAYING IT SEEKS RESOLUTION	Reversing the government's strategy in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, the Bush administration announced today that it would no longer seek a breakup of the company. The government also abandoned a central claim of the lawsuit: that Microsoft had violated federal antitrust law by integrating its Internet Explorer browser software into its Windows operating system. Administration officials said the decision to narrow the case and seek a far less drastic means of regulating Microsoft's practices rather than splitting up the company was motivated by two forces. Officials want to quickly resolve a case whose roots go back seven years. And last June a federal appeals court here issued an opinion that was skeptical of the breakup and made it more difficult to challenge Microsoft's practice of bundling its programs.
9/7/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Upgrades Pocket Software	Microsoft announced yesterday that it planned to release a new version of its software to run hand-held organizers, updating a product that has taken sales from Palm Inc. The Microsoft Pocket PC 2002 operating system will go on sale Oct. 4 in hand-held computers from Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft said. Others using the software -- Compaq Computer, Toshiba and Casio Computer -- will also make devices with it, as will several new partners, a vice president at Microsoft, Ben Waldman, said. He would not identify the new partners. The Pocket PC has been gaining share since it was released in April 2000. Also yesterday, Hewlett-Packard and Intel announced that an Intel processor, the StrongARM, and a memory chip, the StrataFlash, would be used to power Hewlett-Packard's new line of Jornada hand-held computers.
9/7/2001	A Huge 4-Year Crusade Gets Credit for a Coup	If the Microsoft Corporation won at least a partial victory today, its corporate adversaries were quick to argue that the company's huge and far-reaching lobbying crusade of the last few years should receive a healthy share of the credit. From a cold start just four years ago, Microsoft assembled a formidable lobbying apparatus that worked to touch anyone who could have any influence over the antitrust case against it -- particularly, during last year's election campaign, Republican candidates, including George W. Bush.
9/7/2001	Competitors See a Giant That Is Now Largely Unfettered	Leaders of the computing industry said that the Justice Department's decision yesterday to abandon its effort to break up Microsoft would leave the company little constrained by any resulting restrictions. ''What can they possibly come up with that can frighten Microsoft enough to change its behavior that it's been developing for decades?'' said Benjamin D. Black, a principal of the Rosewood Venture Group, a venture capital firm in San Francisco. ''I still won't invest in companies that are directly in front of Microsoft's development path.''
9/7/2001	Excerpts From Justice Dept. Decision on Microsoft	Following are excerpts from a statement by the Justice Department today announcing that it will not seek a breakup of the Microsoft Corporation: The Department of Justice's antitrust division today advised Microsoft that it will not seek a breakup of the company in remand proceedings before the U.S. District Court. It also informed the company that it does not intend to pursue further proceedings on the tying count of the original complaint. The department said it is taking these steps in an effort to obtain prompt, effective and certain relief for consumers. . . .
9/7/2001	Reforming Microsoft	Faced with a federal appellate court ruling unsympathetic to breaking up Microsoft, the Justice Department abandoned that goal yesterday. While that decision may be a pragmatic move, it must not turn into a wholesale retreat from efforts to curb Microsoft's monopolistic practices. Alternative remedies are available and should be pursued, either through a settlement with the company or a court order. Breaking Microsoft into separate companies -- one focused on producing the Windows operating system, the other on software applications -- was the best means of ensuring that Microsoft refrained from monopolistic behavior. That option, however, was effectively eliminated in June by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In their unanimous opinion reversing Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to break up the company and remanding the case for further proceedings to a new trial judge, nine judges indicated that they considered the penalty unduly harsh.
9/7/2001	Pendulum Swings to Microsoft, But the Degree Remains Unclear	The Bush administration, by adopting a measured, conservative approach in the Microsoft antitrust case, clearly increased the chances that the two sides would reach a settlement. The Justice Department yesterday made a crucial concession in dropping the charge that it has been illegal for Microsoft to pursue its longstanding practice of bundling, or tying, new software to its monopoly product -- the industry-standard Windows operating system. William H. Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chairman, and his top lieutenants regarded the company's bitter fight against the federal government and the states suing it mainly as an uncompromising defense of Microsoft's unfettered freedom to add whatever it wants to Windows, the corporate crown jewel.
9/6/2001	A Keyboard Puts Shortcuts Within Fingers' Reach	Keyboards are, by definition, touchy-feely. Microsoft's new model, called the Microsoft Office Keyboard, may be the most touchy-feely yet. Straight out of the box, the keyboard reveals a new set of buttons and keys alongside all the familiar Qwerty ones. The new controls permit users to do previously mouse-intensive operations -- like New, Open, Close, Reply, Forward, Send, Spell Check, Save, Print, Undo and Redo -- with the press of a single button.
9/6/2001	Windows XP: Microsoft's New Look for Fall, in Size XXL	IF you could choose only one word to sum up Windows XP, ''big'' would come to mind. Microsoft's new operating system is physically big, requiring two gigabytes of hard-drive space and more than an hour to install. It's big in scope, too: XP is Microsoft's attempt to merge its home line (the friendly but cranky Windows 95, 98 and Me) with its corporate line (the unattractive but rock-solid Windows NT and 2000) into a unified operating system that offers the best of both. But above all, Windows XP is big for computer companies. It is designed for very young, high-octane PC's -- 128 megabytes of memory and up, less than two years old -- and if it's a hit, the net effect is likely to be a wave of PC buying and upgrading. No wonder that executives at PC makers are walking around with dilated pupils and moist palms, hailing Windows XP as the savior that will deliver us from the tech slump, the recession and probably world hunger.
9/6/2001	Dear User: This Bootleg Copy Will Self-Destruct in 30 Days	WINDOWS XP has many features designed to make it easy for home users to customize and copy their own digital movie and music files, but there is one thing they will not be able to copy: Windows XP itself. In an effort to reduce the practice of casual sharing of software among family members and friends, Microsoft has built an anticopying mechanism called Product Activation into Windows XP.
9/5/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Windows XP Orders Accepted	Gateway Inc., the second-largest direct seller of personal computers, said it would begin accepting orders today for Microsoft's newest operating program, Windows XP, the subject of a coming antitrust hearing. Gateway is tentatively scheduled to begin shipping the new system on its PC's on Sept. 24, said Lisa Emard, a company spokeswoman. Profit and revenue are falling at Gateway, which is based in San Diego, because of declining demand and fierce competition for computer sales. Rival PC makers like Dell Computer have said they also intend to begin shipping Windows XP by the end of this month. A federal judge is scheduled to begin a hearing on Sept. 21 on a request by federal prosecutors to force Microsoft to change its operating system, which they say is anti-competitive because it places restrictions on competing software programs.
9/5/2001	The Browser as a Cookie-Control Key	To many privacy advocates, the most sensible place to offer privacy protection is precisely where the online privacy furor began: the Internet browser. Both Netscape and Microsoft, which make the leading browsers, designed their early versions to accept cookies by default, requiring consumers who want more privacy to change software settings -- something most of them dread. Browser companies have tried to placate consumers who dislike cookies while serving the Internet companies that depend on cookies. Netscape (which is now part of AOL Time Warner) and Microsoft have taken different approaches to building privacy protection into their product designs.
9/5/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Linens And Knot Form Alliance	Linens'n Things, a retailer of home textiles, housewares and home accessories with 284 stores in 40 states, yesterday announced a partnership with the Knot, a popular wedding registry Web site that provides content to America Online and MSN. Linens'n Things will offer more than 2,000 bedding and bath products through the Knot's Web site, www.theknot.com. As a part of the deal, wedding guests will also be able to view and purchase gifts for Knot-registered couples at Linens'n Things retail locations nationwide. Shares in Linens'n Things rose 25 cents, to $26.25. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
8/31/2001	Regulators In Europe Add To Scrutiny Of Microsoft	The European Commission broadened its antitrust investigation of Microsoft today, introducing new accusations about the company's bundling of its Windows Media Player, and backing up existing concerns about the company's practices in the server operating systems market with new evidence. The commission said that Microsoft might have violated European antitrust rules by ''using illegal practices to extend its dominant position in the market for personal computer operating systems into the market for low-end server operating systems.'' And it raised new concerns about the bundling of the Windows Media Player, which plays audio and video files, into the Windows 2000 operating system.
8/30/2001	Money and Quicken Duel For the Consumer's Dollar	Intuit rolled out next year's version of Quicken -- its venerable financial tracking software -- just in time for everybody to switch from summer sloth mode back to business mode. Quicken 2002 has several features to make it easier to get your nose back to the grindstone, including a simplified process for creating accounts and automatically categorizing transactions for tracking and tax purposes. Assuming you have online access to your accounts, it can even reconcile your bank statements automatically. (You do balance your checkbook, don't you?)
8/30/2001	Playing With Consumers	EVEN on a modest computer, the revving of the virtual racing car's engine stirs anticipation. The car, low-slung and rendered for speed, glistens under a digitally created sky that is forever high noon. It's the online computer game Dodge Speedway. With the click of a mouse, a player is behind the wheel and joining other racers jostling their way around a skid-scarred track to a throbbing soundtrack of techno music.
8/29/2001	Intel Insists Faster Chips Can Aid Sales	With the chip industry's speed race outpacing mainstream computer uses, a top executive of the Intel Corporation said today that the computer industry must give customers more reasons to spend money on technology. The executive, Paul S. Otellini, an executive vice president, also said he expected Intel to meet its financial targets for the current quarter. The company, which is scheduled to update Wall Street formally on Sept. 6, had predicted that its sales in the second half of the year would grow slightly over the first half.
8/27/2001	Microsoft Puts Off Introduction Of Xbox Game Console in Japan	The Microsoft Corporation has delayed the Japanese introduction of its Xbox video game console until next year but says it remains on schedule to begin selling the consoles on its home turf on Nov. 8. Microsoft plans to announce in Tokyo today that the Xbox will go on sale in Japan on Feb. 22. The company does not intend to say how many consoles it will ship in Japan.
8/27/2001	Compressed Data; Unleashing Icons and Embracing Desktop Clutter	Remember the ''clean desktop'' for Windows XP? That was the original plan for the new Microsoft operating system, a default desktop screen with a pristine countryside scene uncluttered by icons. Instead, the user would go to the ''start menu,'' and a single click would bring up a menu of eight iconlike links to software applications, Internet services or Web sites. At least three of them would be Microsoft offerings. Microsoft reversed course last month and declared that PC makers could put icons on the Windows XP desktop, after a federal appeals court found that Microsoft's past contracts with PC companies were an overly restrictive abuse of its monopoly power. At the time, Microsoft portrayed the move as going the extra mile to accommodate a pesky court ruling, even though, the company insisted, its clean-desktop approach made PC's less confusing to users while affording plenty of competitive choice.
8/25/2001	Judge Is Assigned to Decide Microsoft Antitrust Penalties	The government's landmark antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation was assigned today to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a seasoned trial court judge and Clinton appointee to the federal bench. She will determine how to penalize the company for abusing its monopoly power in the software business. Judge Kollar-Kotelly was selected randomly from the pool of available federal district court judges to replace Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The assignment represents an important point in the long-running antitrust case. Two months ago, the federal appeals court here removed Judge Jackson and chastised him for discussing the case with reporters.
8/18/2001	U.S. Appeals Court Rejects Microsoft Request for Delay	A Federal appeals court today rejected the effort by the Microsoft Corporation to delay the antitrust case against it, setting the stage for the selection of a new trial court judge soon to consider the appropriate penalties against the company. The decision was a procedural setback for Microsoft, which had sought to stop all proceedings until the Supreme Court returns in October and decides whether to consider the company's request to throw the case out.
8/16/2001	Microsoft, Again, Is the Darling of Fund Managers	Microsoft won back support from money managers in the second quarter as it recorded a partial victory in the courtroom, according to recent regulatory filings. The renewed popularity helped propel the stock to a 33.5 percent gain from April to June, and came even as the biggest money management firms continued to trim their overall holdings in the technology sector.
8/15/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Microsoft Disputes Xbox Report	In a report released yesterday, a securities analyst said a flaw in Intel's motherboard design for Microsoft's forthcoming Xbox game console could set back the initial manufacturing schedule, but Microsoft repudiated the report. ''There's absolutely no problem with the design of Intel's motherboard,'' Microsoft said. ''We're still on track for a Nov. 8 launch.'' The analyst, Eric Ross of Thomas Weisel Partners, wrote in a research note on the graphics company NVidia that ''multiple sources throughout the Xbox supply chain'' had reported three- to four-week delays in the manufacturing schedule. Microsoft has committed $500 million to promote Xbox and has said it will release 600,000 to 800,000 of the machines on Nov. 8, in time for the critical holiday shopping season. Microsoft shares fell $1.14, to $64.69. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
8/14/2001	Comcast Said To Be Talking Of Side Deals In AT&T Fight	The Comcast Corporation, in its effort to acquire AT&T's cable television business, has held exploratory talks with AOL Time Warner and other potential rival suitors that could effectively stave off competing bids, according to several executives close to the discussions. The executives said Comcast and AOL Time Warner, for example, have discussed the possibility of a deal that could make it easy for AOL Time Warner to buy the 25 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment that AT&T owns, if Comcast wins control of the AT&T cable business. AOL Time Warner has been stalled for months in negotiations to buy the 25 percent stake directly from AT&T.
8/13/2001	PC Makers And Microsoft Squabble Over Desktop Icons	One company's idea of flexibility can be another company's notion of contortion. A month ago, Microsoft announced that it would give personal computer makers greater freedom to place the software and services of Microsoft's rivals on the desktop screen of the new Microsoft Windows XP operating system.
8/13/2001	Compressed Data; Passionate Pas Seul by Microsoft's Chief Executive Captivates Internet Audience	Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation, has long been known for his abundant energy, but a video that began making the rounds of the Internet last week, provides fodder for those who say his ardor can, in fact, be a little startling. In the video, which appears to have been taped at an internal corporate pep rally, Mr. Ballmer bounds onstage to the song ''Get on Your Feet'' by Gloria Estefan then stalks around the stage and frantically jumps about for almost a full minute, screaming things like, ''C'mon! Give it up for me!'' Once he catches his breath, Mr. Ballmer bellows, ''I have four words for you: I -- Love -- This -- Company! Yeah!''
8/9/2001	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about Microsoft's decision to appeal its antitrust case to the Supreme Court misstated the timing of conversations held by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court with reporters. They began in September 1999, after the trial and before Judge Jackson issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law; they did not start at the outset of the case.
8/8/2001	Research Unit For Microsoft Is Opening Up In California	Microsoft is setting up a research group in Silicon Valley to work on technologies for the company's push beyond the personal computer and increasingly into Internet services. The move is intended to strengthen Microsoft's Internet services initiative, called .Net, a centerpiece of the company's strategy for the future.
8/8/2001	Microsoft Asks Supreme Court to Reverse Antitrust Finding	Microsoft asked the Supreme Court today to reverse a recent appeals court finding that the company had repeatedly violated antitrust law and to expunge all legal and factual findings in the case because of disparaging comments about the company by a federal district judge. At the same time, Microsoft's lawyers asked the appeals court here to temporarily suspend all other legal proceedings connected with the government's antitrust case until the Supreme Court, which is in recess until October, can decide whether to hear the case.
8/3/2001	Court Again Rebuffs Microsoft On Bundling of Its Software	A federal appeals court refused yesterday to reconsider its ruling that Microsoft illegally blended Internet browsing software with its monopoly product, the Windows operating system. The move is a setback for Microsoft and could open the way for courts to second-guess the company's product designs, including that of Windows XP, the new version of its operating system, which is scheduled to go on sale in October.
8/2/2001	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: 2 Giants Join Wireless Group's Board	Representatives of Microsoft and Intel have joined the board of the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, a trade group promoting the Wi-Fi platform for small wireless networks. The Wi-Fi format, also known as 802.11b, has had enormous growth in recent months as airports and campuses have established local wireless networks. Last week, the alliance announced that 22 new companies had joined the organization, bringing the roster to 103. Although both Microsoft and Intel are conspicuous supporters of the competing Bluetooth wireless standard, they have simultaneously backed Wi-Fi. Bluetooth has suffered a number of setbacks recently. In April, Microsoft said it would use Wi-Fi technology, not Bluetooth, in its new Windows XP operating system. And Psion, which had been planning a Bluetooth-enabled hand-held computer, dropped those plans last month. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
7/31/2001	Return of Computer 'Worm' Feared Today	The rogue computer program known as Code Red is about to strike again, computer security experts and federal officials warned yesterday. The program, which infected an estimated 350,000 computers on July 19 and then went dormant, has a digital version of a life cycle: when activated, it scans the Internet for vulnerable systems and installs itself.

Hal R Varian Economic Scene column on how society can be affected for good or ill by bundling, such as when movie studios force theaters to buy a dud movie if they want a hit or when Microsoft bundles Windows operating system with Internet Explorer; notes 1962 Supreme Court decision that bundling is illegal only when company with significant market power, a monopolist, packages its monopolized product with one of its other products; says bundling offers way to extend monopoly, to increase revenue and to raise entry costs, bit it may also offer enhanced functionality and lower production costs; photo (M)
7/25/2001	Privacy Group Is Taking Issue With Microsoft	A leading privacy group intends to file a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about Microsoft's plans to bundle its Passport identification system for collecting personal information into its new Windows XP operating system. The complaint from the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest and advocacy group, promises to add to the pressure on Microsoft's strategy of tightly linking a series of Internet services like music, shopping and banking to Windows XP.
7/23/2001	New Economy; The pioneering spirit lives on at Apple Computer, and the industry cannot afford to ignore it.	BY the usual yardstick of market share, Apple Computer is a computing pipsqueak. Its slender slice of personal computer sales is less than 4 percent in the United States, and its share of the global market is even slimmer. Yet in terms of industry attention, press coverage and attendance at trade shows like the Macworld Expo in New York last week, Apple still looms pretty large. Why? History and wishful thinking are part of the explanation. Apple was a pioneer, so an inordinate share of industry people and technology journalists got hooked on computing thanks to the Apple II and, later, the Macintosh.
7/20/2001	Corrections	A picture caption in Circuits on May 31 with an article about the use of Microsoft PowerPoint in schools misspelled the surname of a kindergarten pupil shown. His mother informed The Times by e-mail this week that he is Quentin Carranza, not Czrranza.
7/20/2001	Microsoft Says PC Business Will Worsen	The Microsoft Corporation reported solid gains in quarterly revenues and operating profits yesterday, but the company said that it expected the personal computer business to worsen further in the current quarter. John Connors, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said that during the current quarter ending in September he expected worldwide demand for personal computers to be ''very soft to flat.'' If the Microsoft projections prove accurate, that would represent a further slowdown from the quarter ended in June, when PC shipments grew a sluggish 7 percent or so, Mr. Connors said.
7/19/2001	Microsoft Asks Court For Review	Three weeks after claiming to be victorious in its antitrust appeal, the Microsoft Corporation asked the appeals court today to reconsider an important part of its decision about product design that could have significant implications for the new operating system the company plans to begin selling soon. Late last month the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that Microsoft had repeatedly violated Section 2 of the Sherman antitrust act by abusing its monopoly power in the software market. The court said the company bullied smaller software rivals and computer makers. Microsoft did not contest those findings in a rehearing petition it filed today with the court.
7/17/2001	Corrections	A front-page article on Thursday about Microsoft's relaxing of some contract restrictions on personal computer makers incompletely described a federal appeals court ruling on June 28 about the company's bundling of its Internet browser with its Windows operating system. The court ruled that Microsoft had bundled the browsing software with Windows in a way that violated antitrust laws on two counts. But the court also said that bundling of software was not inherently illegal. It vacated that finding by a lower court and sent the issue back for reconsideration by a new judge.
7/17/2001	USA Networks To Buy 75% Of Expedia	USA Networks agreed yesterday to buy the 75 percent of the Expedia travel agency owned by the Microsoft Corporation with the goal of creating a vacation shopping channel -- bridging television and the Internet -- to mirror its Home Shopping Channel. USA Networks is paying a mix of its shares and other securities that different analysts valued at $38 to $44 a share. That puts the total value to Microsoft at $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Because there is no cash involved, the actual effect of the deal is to give Microsoft 3 percent to 5 percent of USA Networks, the media conglomerate controlled by Barry Diller.
7/16/2001	Microsoft Adversary to Become F.T.C. Official	Susan A. Creighton, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has dogged Microsoft for years and only last month wrote a ''white paper'' assessing the antitrust issues raised by the company's new Windows XP operating system, is abandoning the chase. She is joining the Bush administration as an antitrust watchdog. Ms. Creighton, a 41-year-old lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, has agreed to become a deputy director of the Federal Trade Commission's competition bureau, a job she will begin in late August. She joins an administration that has not yet shown its hand on antitrust policy, and antitrust enforcement is not necessarily predictable along party lines. But the Bush administration, committed to reducing government regulation, is expected to be less aggressive than the Clinton administration in pursuing antitrust cases.
7/16/2001	Private Suits Put Microsoft At Little Risk	The recent appeals court decision upholding a lower court's ruling that Microsoft had violated antitrust law aided the dozens of private antitrust lawsuits customers have filed against the company. But many experts said it might be premature to assert -- as the appeals court did in reversing the order to break up Microsoft -- that private lawsuits could curb the company's behavior when the available government remedies are limited. In fact, none of the private antitrust suits are scheduled for trial within the next year. And some legal experts say that, assuming the suits actually get to trial, consumers are likely to have a hard time proving that they were harmed by Microsoft's actions.
7/14/2001	U.S. and 18 States Agree To Accept Microsoft Ruling	The federal government and 18 states said today that they would not appeal the recent decision by a federal appeals court in the Microsoft antitrust case that reversed an order to break up the company, and they asked instead that the court accelerate the remaining proceedings. The filing was the first indication that the new administration at the Justice Department intended to vigorously press forward with the antitrust case. Some administration critics who have supported the lawsuit had raised concerns that the Justice Department would pursue a quick and easy settlement with the company.
7/13/2001	The Next Microsoft Windows	With the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirming last month that Microsoft is a monopolist that has violated the nation's antitrust laws, the company by all logic should rein in its ambitions for the next version of its Windows operating system. Its competitors now have the upper hand legally to insist on it, and the Bush administration must do the same in any settlement talks with the software giant. Windows XP, due out in October, was designed to go even further than current versions of Windows in enabling Microsoft to use its monopoly in operating systems to boost its other products while thwarting competitors. Indeed, by planning to bundle a host of its own online services with Windows XP, the company aspires to become as dominant a platform for navigating the Internet as it is for more traditional computing needs.
7/13/2001	Napster Appeals an Order To Remain Closed Down	Lawyers for the Napster Internet music service today asked a federal appeals court here to set aside a judge's order that it remain offline until it has shown it has made ''every effort'' to prevent the exchange of copyrighted audio files not permitted for use. Napster's emergency appeal of Judge Marilyn Patel's order, issued on Wednesday, asserted that Napster should be allowed to resume its service if it is making reasonable efforts to filter copyrighted works. In a hearing before Judge Patel on Wednesday, Napster said it presently can filter 99.4 percent of copyrighted works.
7/12/2001	MICROSOFT TO GIVE COMPUTER MAKERS GREATER FREEDOM	Acknowledging that it must change its business practices, Microsoft announced yesterday that it would give personal computer makers more freedom to choose what software and services they offer on the machines they sell. The concession by Microsoft is a response to the decision last month by a federal court of appeals, which found many of the dominant software maker's licensing deals with computer makers were an illegal abuse of its monopoly power.
7/10/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Microsoft Forms Privacy Venture	Microsoft and VeriSign, an Internet security company, said they would work together to make Microsoft's .Net Internet services safer for the privacy of users. Consumer advocates have criticized the part of Microsoft's new .Net initiative known as Hailstorm, which would collect large amounts of users' personal information within one computer system. Microsoft said it would use VeriSign's technology to improve the security of the personal information collected by .Net, and VeriSign said it began using computer servers based on Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system as a host for Internet domain names and Web sites. Financial terms were not announced. Chris Gaither(NYT)
7/9/2001	Microsoft Sees Clear Victory On 'Bundling'	To Microsoft, its long-running antitrust battle against the government has always been about freedom -- the unfettered freedom to design its products as the company sees fit. Even if, as Microsoft once colorfully argued, that meant bundling a ''ham sandwich,'' or anything else, in its flagship Windows operating system. On that vital point, Microsoft sounded triumphant after a federal appeals court delivered its ruling in the antitrust case against the company on June 28. ''The central issue in this case was the fundamental principle that every company must have the ability to innovate and improve its products,'' said William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman.
7/8/2001	Survey Shows Approval Of Microsoft Ruling	The outcome of the federal government's antitrust case against Microsoft will likely be several years down the road. But a recent independent survey shows that many Americans who are following the case have already made up their minds about what should happen to the company. ''Americans want a Microsoft that is unified, innovative and no longer in court,'' said Thomas Riehle, president for public affairs at Ipsos-Reid, a market research firm with headquarters in Vancouver, British Columbia.
7/4/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Interest In Phone Company	Microsoft is considering an investment in Korea Telecom, the government-controlled telephone company and software manufacturer, said Korea's minister of information and communication, Yang Seung Taik. Mr. Yang said Microsoft was one of the companies with which his ministry was negotiating. The government, which owns 40 percent of Korea Telecom, failed in February to sell nearly 15 percent of the shares locally. But officials hope that Microsoft and other foreign companies will see Korea Telecom as a route into Korea's burgeoning Internet and mobile telephone markets. Don Kirk (NYT)
7/1/2001	The Nation; The Land of Monopolies	AFTER Thursday's decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which threw out out District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to break up Microsoft, the big question seemed to be: Who won? It's an interesting question, given that the court agreed with Judge Jackson that Microsoft was, after all, a predatory monopoly. But whatever the answer in this case, there is a growing realization among economists and technology experts that Microsoft may be only the most visible symptom of a problem afflicting the Internet economy.
7/1/2001	Reckonings; The Smell Test	When the members of the appeals court were writing up their ruling on Microsoft, did an animated paper clip pop up on their screen, bat its eyelashes and say: ''You seem to be writing a legal opinion. Would you like some help?'' Actually, we could all use some help here: the Microsoft case is fundamentally difficult. How do you deal with a monopoly when the monopoly is ''natural,'' when it would exist even in the absence of foul play? For even if Microsoft had been utterly scrupulous in its conduct (which it wasn't), the force of ''network externalities'' -- the incentives to use the same system that everyone else is using -- would have given it a monopoly in the operating-system market.
7/1/2001	Microsoft's Monopoly?	To the Editor: Re ''Appeals Court Voids Order for Breaking Up Microsoft but Finds It Abused Power'' (front page, June 29):
7/1/2001	Microsoft Wins A Chance To Focus	FOR once, conventional wisdom may have it right. A lot of people assumed that the government's antitrust case against Microsoft would not stand up on appeal, and that a court-ordered breakup of the company would be reversed.
6/30/2001	Microsoft Case Back in Play, And the Lobbying Heats Up	As federal and state prosecutors ponder what to do next with Microsoft, they have already come under enormous lobbying pressure from the company to settle quickly and from its rivals, most notably AOL Time Warner, to continue litigating. The lobbying campaign was in full swing even before Thursday's decision by a federal court of appeals here, which vacated the order to break up Microsoft but also found that the company had engaged in a raft of anticompetitive practices in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. It is now expected to intensify and to become, for the city's cadre of lawyers and lobbyists, one of the most lucrative fights of the year.
6/30/2001	Competition Wins in Court	Every so often, hard cases make good law. In one of the best antitrust opinions in years, a federal appeals court this week brought sudden clarity to the epic Microsoft case and delivered a ruling that will guide business practices in the shifting technology market. The seven judges -- including notable antitrust skeptics -- held unanimously that Microsoft broke antitrust law to shore up its Windows operating system monopoly. No longer can Microsoft dismiss its antitrust problems as being caused by one idiosyncratic judge.
6/29/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Sony Cuts Playstation Price	The Sony Corporation reduced the price of its PlayStation 2 video game console in Japan by 12 percent, to $280.72 from $319.22. Although Sony faces intense competition from Microsoft and Nintendo in the home video game market, it is not expected to extend the price reduction to sales in the United States. Microsoft plans to start selling its Xbox video game system in the United States on Nov. 8 for $299. Nintendo's GameCube is expected to reach North American stores on Nov. 5. The PlayStation 2, which currently sells for $299 in this country, has been on the market for almost a year. Sony has sold more than 2.7 million PlayStation 2 consoles in North America and 7 million more overseas. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
6/29/2001	Key Sections of the Decision by the United States Court of Appeals	Following are excerpts from yesterday's decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the Microsoft antitrust case: . . . After carefully considering the voluminous record on appeal -- including the District Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the testimony and exhibits submitted at trial, the parties' briefs, and the oral arguments before this court -- we find that some but not all of Microsoft's liability challenges have merit. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the District Court's judgment that Microsoft violated Sec. 2 of the Sherman Act by employing anticompetitive means to maintain a monopoly in the operating system market; we reverse the District Court's determination that Microsoft violated Sec. 2 of the Sherman Act by illegally attempting to monopolize the Internet browser market; and we remand the District Court's finding that Microsoft violated Sec. 1 of the Sherman Act by unlawfully tying its browser to its operating system. Our judgment extends to the District Court's findings with respect to the state law counterparts of the plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims.
6/29/2001	Some Possible Carrots and Sticks	There is still a remote chance that Microsoft could be broken up: a federal appeals court left some wiggle room in its order yesterday that a lower court reconsider the remedy for the finding that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power in the software business. But if a district court judge, as yet unnamed, agrees with the suggestion by the appellate judges that breaking up the software company is inappropriate, there are a range of other options it will probably consider, antitrust experts said yesterday.
6/29/2001	APPEALS COURT VOIDS ORDER FOR BREAKING UP MICROSOFT BUT FINDS IT ABUSED POWER	A federal appeals court unanimously threw out a lower court's order today that the Microsoft Corporation should be broken up, although the appeals court found that the company had repeatedly abused its monopoly power in the software business. The appeals court also sharply chastised the district judge who oversaw the Microsoft antitrust trial and removed him from any further involvement in the case because of derogatory comments he made to reporters about the company and its senior executives.
6/29/2001	After 3 Years of Foreboding, A Light New Mood at Microsoft	The weather is always a good source of conversation here in the Seattle area, and Microsoft officials liberally invoked meteorological analogies today in offering generally jubilant reactions to the appeals court ruling in the antitrust battle with the federal government. ''I'm sure you'll understand if you live in Seattle the feeling of the sunshine breaking through, and all of us at Microsoft see this as the sunshine we've been waiting for,'' said Jeff Raikes, group vice president of the company's productivity and business services group.
6/29/2001	Making A Judgement On a Moving Target	The appeals court ruling yesterday in the antitrust case against Microsoft left unanswered one of the most pressing questions facing the computer industry: Will Microsoft have to change how it acts? The company is preparing to release a new version of its operating system, one that integrates it even more tightly into Internet services like music, shopping and banking. And indications are that it is exercising some of the same types of power that led the appellate judges to uphold a trial court's finding that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power in the software business.
6/29/2001	A Long Legal Road Grows Longer	Key events in the antitrust case against Microsoft
6/29/2001	Microsoft's Core Illegalities	Both sides claimed victory after yesterday's unanimous ruling by seven judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the Microsoft antitrust case. The software giant and its investors were clearly relieved that the judges had vacated the lower court's order breaking up the company and reversed one of the findings of illegal behavior on Microsoft's part. But Microsoft's partial victory should not be allowed to minimize the underlying triumph for federal prosecutors and American consumers. The core of yesterday's decision affirmed United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly in the market for computer operating systems. This is an important victory for antitrust enforcement and a sufficient basis for the government to continue pressing for a meaningful remedy in the case. With Microsoft preparing to release Windows XP, a new version of its operating system, this fall, the Bush administration should act vigorously to uphold this ruling and be vigilant against future anticompetitive behavior by the company.
6/28/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Microsoft Plans Olympics Site	Signaling a move into sports content for Microsoft, MSNBC.com and MSN will join NBC in producing the Web sites for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. The decision ends a two-month scramble by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee to find replacements for the portal company Quokka Sports, which filed for bankruptcy in late April, and Logictier, which was to provide the host services but said it was leaving the host business. ''Microsoft is clearly the company that survives and thrives in the Internet world,'' said Mitt Romney, chief executive of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. ''Having them as a partner relieves all worries.'' Unlike Quokka, Microsoft will not pay the organizing committee a fee for rights to produce the sites, but will bear the cost of the production and being the host. It will be restricted in advertising its Olympic affiliation and will share ad revenue with all the partners, including the Salt Lake, United States and International Olympic committees. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)
6/28/2001	Palmtops With a P, As in PC	PART of the agony and the ecstasy of being human is our ability to confront the big questions. What's the meaning of existence? Is there life after death? And which is better: the Palm or the Pocket PC? Of course, that last question isn't really fair. It's like asking, ''Which is better: a mango or a shoehorn?'' The two palmtop families were designed for completely different purposes. Palms and Palm compatibles are small, fast, simple, inexpensive organizers meant to keep your calendar and addresses synchronized with your computer. A Pocket PC is Microsoft's effort to shrink a complete Windows PC into a tiny slab, complete with color, sound and expansion slots, closer to a laptop than a calculator.
6/27/2001	Patent Adds Twist to Software Lawsuit	A small developer of software for protecting digital information received a patent yesterday that it said would challenge Microsoft's strategy for linking its next- generation operating system to Internet services and content like digital music. Microsoft accused the small company of ''patent terrorism.''
6/27/2001	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Level 3 To Carry MSN Services	Level 3 Communications, which operates a large fiber optic network, said it had signed a new three-year agreement with Microsoft to provide broadband Internet access service for MSN Hotmail, MSN Messenger and several other Microsoft services. The new agreement makes Level 3 a primary broadband provider for Microsoft Network and comes just a day after the company announced a similar deal with the Internet service provider EarthLink. Both agreements follow close on the heels of Level 3's announcement last week that it would eliminate the jobs of about 1,400 of its 5,900 employees and reduce capital spending. The Microsoft agreement calls for three gigabits a second of MSN traffic to be routed over the Level 3 network, out of MSN's total traffic of 10 gigabits a second. The contract also specifies that MSN will have the option to steer the entire 10 gigabits a second to the Level 3 network. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
6/22/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Venture Buying Spanish-Language Portal	The MSN unit of Microsoft says its Internet venture with Teléfonos de Mexico has agreed to buy the closely held Spanish-language Web network Yupi Internet to attract Hispanic users. Terms were not disclosed. The move comes as Microsoft increases its competition with AOL Time Warner. Telmex, Mexico's largest telephone company, and Microsoft's T1msn Internet unit in Mexico will start a Spanish-language portal called Yupi/ MSN. Microsoft is trying to build its MSN Internet business with more consumer services as it tries to catch up with AOL's America Online. The number of Hispanics in the United States almost doubled during the 1990's, according to Census data.
6/22/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft XP Draws A Warning	The state prosecutors who joined the United States Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft said they found the software maker's new operating system ''troubling'' and potentially anticompetitive. Two of the attorneys general, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Tom Miller of Iowa, said they were concerned about Microsoft's plans to bundle new features into the Windows XP operating system. Microsoft is appealing a breakup order by a federal judge who found that the company had illegally maintained a Windows monopoly. A ruling by the appeals court could come at any time. The attorneys general have ''no current plans for a second lawsuit'' against the software maker, they said in a statement.
6/21/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Browser Expands Beyond English	In an effort to expand the language capabilities of the Internet's address system, Microsoft and VeriSign said users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser could now reach Internet addresses by typing Chinese- or Japanese-language characters. Using technology from RealNames, version 5.0 or later of Microsoft's Web browser will automatically render the characters as addresses recognizable by the domain name system, without requiring the use of special software. As the company responsible for the databases containing the .com, .net and .org addresses, VeriSign is also managing the testing phase for what are known as internationalized domain names, or Internet addresses that contain foreign-language characters.

6/21/2001	Is There Life After AOL	AN overprotective parent. Comfortable old shoes or pajamas. A bad marriage. People who subscribe to America Online, America's largest Internet service provider, use a variety of metaphors to describe their feelings about it. Like McDonald's, the fast food purveyor that people love to hate, AOL has many ambivalent customers. ''What surprises me is that so many people use AOL but no one seems to like it,'' said Rose Miller, a potter in Sandia Park, N.M. ''A lot of people complain about it.''
6/19/2001	Microsoft Has Patch For Security Flaw	Microsoft said yesterday that it was issuing a software patch for a troubling security flaw in its Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 server operating system programs. The vulnerability, which is known as a buffer overrun flaw, could permit an attacker to gain control of a Web server by sending data to a computer running certain versions of the Microsoft operating system.
6/18/2001	A Growing Rivalry Derails AOL Talks For Microsoft Deal	The collapse of talks between Microsoft and AOL Time Warner this weekend was rooted in Microsoft's strategy of making its new operating system the tool to provide a wide range of tightly integrated services directly to computer users, an area AOL has dominated for years. The dispute, over how their software would be combined, shows how rivalry in the computer industry has shifted from individual pieces of software, like Web browsers, to control over whole systems that govern how consumers use computers.
6/17/2001	Break in Talks Between AOL And Microsoft	Negotiations between AOL Time Warner and Microsoft abruptly ended yesterday after the two sides could not agree on the issue of AOL's strategic partnership with RealNetworks, a Microsoft competitor. The two sides have been negotiating a variety of issues, including whether AOL will use Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, the cooperation of the two companies' instant messaging systems and Microsoft's desire for AOL to include its media player, which competes with RealNetworks's RealPlayer.
6/16/2001	National Briefing | Northwest: Washington: Taking Up Traffic	With passage of a budget finally behind them, state lawmakers turned to a plan to deal with traffic in the Seattle-Tacoma area. They have been prodded by the business community: the region's transportation mess ''impairs the company's ability to hire and retain people,'' the Microsoft chairman William H. Gates III said in a letter to lawmakers. Sam Howe Verhovek (NYT)
6/14/2001	Messengers That Carry Big Bundles	THE first time I heard of an instant message was in 1994, when an old friend suggested that we stop blasting e-mail back and forth across America Online and have a proper online chat. The next night, when I booted up my Mac at the agreed hour and signed on to AOL, a tiny window popped up so my friend could say, ''Hey.'' We proceeded to spend two hours, he in Iowa and I in New York, in what can only be called a state of Intense I.M. Seven years later, with Internet connections as necessary as food, coffee and ''Sex and the City'' boxed sets for many people, much of the online world seems to be in a state of Intense I.M. Several free instant-message programs from competing companies have appeared. But one thing hamstringing a full-blown communications revolution is that the people using one service generally find it impossible to exchange instant messages with people on other systems. (And that is a big problem -- imagine how popular e-mail would be if people had to have the same Internet service provider to communicate.) There is a movement afoot to create a fully interoperable instant-message system, but for now, the services are still essentially walled off.
6/14/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Liberate Picked By German Cable Company	Liberate Technologies, a maker of software for Internet appliances, said yesterday that its software would be used by Kabel Hessen, the first major German cable company to offer interactive television. The German company's selection of Liberate was a blow for its bitter rival in the market, Microsoft. Microsoft recently started a new service with TV Cabo Portugal and is experimenting with a cable company in the Netherlands. Last week, however, AT&T's broadband division shelved a project to build a set-top cable box using Microsoft's interactive television software. Liberate said Kabel Hessen's digital interactive television service would be accessible to more than 250,000 households in the Frankfurt region by the end of 2001. On Tuesday, Liberate announced the formation of an alliance that includes some of the largest makers of chips and television software. The group will design Linux-based software for set-top boxes that deliver TV programming to homes, aiming to create a lower-cost product than the one from Microsoft. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
6/13/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Msn To Work With Loudeye	Loudeye Technologies, which makes software to broadcast audio and video on the Internet, said it would provide music samples to MSN, the online service owned by Microsoft. The financial terms were not disclosed. Loudeye, which has relationships with all five major record labels as well as more than 800 independent labels, will offer 100,000 song samples to MSN sites. Two weeks ago, Loudeye, which is based in Seattle, signed a similar agreement with the America Online service of AOL Time Warner to provide music samples and other digital media services. Last week, it struck a deal to help the online song-trading service Napster identify and weed out copyrighted songs. Loudeye shares rose 22 cents, or 14.6 percent, to $1.73. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
6/12/2001	Microsoft Is Ready to Supply A Phone in Every Computer	Microsoft's new Windows XP operating system for PC's goes further than ever before in commandeering the capabilities of the most widely used desktop tool in America: the telephone. The ability to use the personal computer as an ''intelligent'' phone has been viewed largely as a curiosity by the computer and telecommunications industries, not to mention by consumers. Internet telephony has mostly not been high quality, and conversations are frequently plagued with static and delays. It has also been difficult for computer telephone callers to find each other without inconvenient and sometimes costly third-party directory services.
6/12/2001	Corrections	An article in Business Day on June 4 about a type of Internet attack known as distributed denial of service, and concerns from some networking security experts about the vulnerability of Microsoft's coming Windows XP operating system, misstated an analysis by Stefan R. Savage, a professor of computer science. While he is skeptical about fighting such attacks with generally available security software, he did not directly discuss Microsoft's approach to combating them.
6/10/2001	Business; The Corporate Alliance, as a Tightrope Act	BY announcing last month that it would no longer sell tires to the Ford Motor Company, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. completed the unraveling of a relationship that had spanned nearly a century. But in the arena of business alliances, the surprise was that Firestone's ''Dear John'' letter came so late in the relationship.
6/8/2001	AT&T Drops Commitment To Cable Box	Suggesting that sophisticated interactive television will remain a distant dream in the United States, AT&T's broadband division has dropped its commitment to an advanced set-top cable box that was supposed to showcase Microsoft's interactive television software. Most cable customers have basic cable systems, and a smaller number subscribe to digital cable services that offer an electronic on-screen program guide and multiple pay-per-view channels that approximate video-on-demand. But for the last decade, computer and media industry executives have held out the promise of a future with true interactive television that would allow viewers to do a range of things including banking, shopping, sending e-mail and surfing the Web.
6/8/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Adds A Director	James I. Cash, a professor at Harvard Business School and a consultant, was appointed yesterday to the Microsoft board. He is the second new director named by the company in recent weeks. Mr. Cash, 53, was the chairman of Harvard's master's of business administration program from 1992 to 1995 and has been a Harvard faculty member since 1976. He has written several books on information technology and managing information systems, and is on several other corporate boards, Microsoft said. Mr. Cash, above, joins Microsoft as it prepares an upgrade to its Windows operating system, due out in October, and tries to sell more programs for server computers and develop additional Internet software and services. Last month, Microsoft named Raymond Gilmartin, the chief executive of Merck & Company, to its board.
6/4/2001	New Economy; Despite Microsoft's best efforts to kill it, the free-software movement shows no sign of quietly rolling over and dying.	AS the philosophical leader of the free-software movement for nearly 20 years, Richard M. Stallman has often found himself at the center of debate -- sometimes even the object of it. Last week, he fired the latest round in a war of words that had erupted a few weeks earlier between Microsoft on the one hand, and the backers of open-source and free software on the other. Open source refers to a method of software development in which a program's basic instructions -- its source code -- are freely available to anyone who wants to tinker with and, ideally, improve them. The result, according to open-source advocates, is better software that is developed faster. Emblematic of the movement is GNU-Linux, the open-source operating system that has emerged as a competitor to Windows.
6/4/2001	Some Guidance From Microsoft	Microsoft likes to be known as being helpful; so do its public relations people. But a number of reporters were surprised last week when the company helpfully went so far as to take the unusual step of recommending three pages of specific questions that they should ask of Richard M. Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, after a speech at New York University.
6/4/2001	Expert Says Windows XP Aids Vandals	The Internet is sustaining a growing plague of attacks that overwhelm Web sites by flooding them with data, and an Internet security expert is warning Microsoft that the planned consumer rollout of its Windows XP operating system for personal computers could make the global network even more vulnerable. The software, which Microsoft plans to begin selling in the fall, adds some powerful Internet-connection capabilities that the security expert has urged the company to remove before putting the product on the market. The new features, he says, makes server computers more susceptible to a type of Web intrusion known as a distributed denial of service attack, in which attackers remotely commandeer hundreds of personal computers connected to the Internet and use them to release a disabling deluge of data against a specific Web site.
6/4/2001	Microsoft And AOL Discuss Links	Microsoft and America Online are negotiating a range of licensing and legal issues so contentious that the two sides disagreed over the weekend whether they were even still talking. The companies are trying to agree on how to include each other's software in each's own products and services. But a significant and unresolved area of dispute is Microsoft's demand that AOL agree not to challenge Microsoft in court over antitrust matters, according to people close to both sides of the talks.
5/31/2001	Learning, One Bullet Point at a Time; Pupils Who Can't Even Spell 'PowerPoint' Can Use It as Slickly as Any C.E.O.	KELVIN MAZARA, a seventh grader at the Edison School in Union City, N.J., could not have appeared more engrossed in the morning's assignment. He and his classmates had been asked to assemble a report about a play they had just read, ''A Raisin in the Sun'' by Lorraine Hansberry, and Kelvin's teacher was reviewing the topics to address: Who are the major characters? What are the conflicts? What are the broad themes? But Kelvin had other questions on his mind. Like his classmates, Kelvin was preparing his book report on PowerPoint, Microsoft's popular presentation software, but he had jumped ahead in picking a background color for his slides: a rich royal blue, featuring a shimmering gold key.
5/31/2001	Microsoft to Introduce New Version of Office	Discounting an imminent federal court ruling that could limit the company's march toward dominating the commercial Internet, Microsoft plans to introduce on Thursday a new version of its Office program that is the most Internet-connected product yet from the company. Office XP, which will sell for $499 and be available in 15 countries, is the sixth version of the program, which was first introduced in 1991.
5/30/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Microsoft Pursues AOL Opportunity	Microsoft will spend an estimated $50 million beginning this week to advertise a new price promotion intended to persuade America Online customers to switch to Microsoft's MSN Internet access. The advertising campaign, which comes after America Online, now part of AOL Time Warner, said it would increase the price of its online service by 9 percent, to $23.90 a month, on July 1, will include television spots as well as print and online ads. The promotion offers consumers who switch to MSN by June 30 three months of free service and a $21.95-a-month rate until Jan. 1, 2003. Bob Visse, group product manager at MSN in Redmond, Wash., said MSN call centers had received 50 percent more inquiries from consumers looking for an alternative to AOL since it announced the price increase last week. Allison Fass (NYT)
5/30/2001	New Microchip Design Is Introduced by Intel	With a barrage of news releases, Intel, most major computer manufacturers and several leading software vendors yesterday inaugurated the commercial era of Itanium, the first in a new family of microchips that Intel hopes will make it a powerhouse in the world of big computers. Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Compaq, Dell, Unisys and SGI were among the large vendors announcing plans to introduce Itanium-based hardware in the coming months. Software companies that described products supporting Itanium included Microsoft and SAS Institute.
5/25/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Tivo Wins Video Recording Patent	TiVo Inc. of San Jose, Calif., has been granted an additional patent covering many of the crucial technologies associated with personal digital video recording, a market that it shares with Microsoft and others. The patent, No. 6,233,389, filed in July 1998, was granted for what TiVo calls the Multimedia Timewarping System. The patent covers its method for recording one program while viewing another, its method for processing video and audio streams in a TV signal and its storage format, which enables users to pause, scan and replay live broadcasts. TiVo was the first to sell a system that allows consumers to modify the experience of viewing live TV. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
5/17/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: XBOX To Go On Sale Nov. 8	Microsoft said yesterday that it would start selling its Xbox video game system in the United States on Nov. 8 for $299. Although the company has committed $500 million to promote Xbox, the starting date gives Microsoft just a few weeks to build interest before the holiday shopping season begins. Robbie Bach, chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said the company would have 600,000 to 800,000 consoles and 15 to 20 games available for sale. Sony, expected to be one of Xbox's major competitors, experienced embarrassing production shortages when it introduced its PlayStation 2 last fall. The competing video game consoles will be offered at identical suggested retail prices. A third game console, GameCube by Nintendo, is expected to reach North American stores on Nov. 5. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
5/16/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Microsoft To Sign Data Pact	The Microsoft Corporation will in the coming weeks sign on to the European Union-United States safe harbor agreement that allows companies to export personal data to the United States from Europe, the company's director of corporate privacy, Richard Purcell, said yesterday. On July 1, companies transferring data to the United States that have not signed the agreement will be in breach of the European data protection directive that outlaws the transfer of personal data to countries like the United States that have more lax data-protection codes. Paul Meller (NYT)
5/15/2001	Sony and AOL Join Forces On the Video Game Front	Moving to create a strategic alliance against Microsoft, Sony Computer Entertainment and America Online plan to announce a new relationship on Tuesday aimed at blending the video game and online Internet experience. The new relationship comes as the video game industry prepares for its annual trade show, where the three major entrants -- Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft -- are jostling to capture mind-share from both software developers and consumers. The show begins on Wednesday in Los Angeles.
5/11/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Move To Rental Model	Microsoft said it would let large business customers rent computer programs for three years, a plan that could protect sales during slowdowns in the personal computer market. Microsoft customers now buy software licenses outright and can use them forever. The new program, which will be offered starting Oct. 1, would require users to buy a new license after the subscription term expires.
5/11/2001	Microsoft shakes up beleaguered San Francisco agencies by shifting its account for Ultimate TV.	THERE may be a shortage of jobs and clients in the San Francisco advertising market as a result of the dot-com meltdown. But there is no shortage of drama as evidenced by big changes that involve Microsoft and several local agencies. Microsoft is dismissing FCB Worldwide in San Francisco, which had served as the creative agency for Ultimate TV, the digital video recorder being introduced to compete against brands like TiVo and ReplayTV. Microsoft is hiring a San Francisco start-up shop, Venables/ Bell & Partners, to create campaigns for Ultimate TV with an annual budget estimated at $50 million.
5/11/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Digital Island Gets Microsoft Assignment	Microsoft said yesterday that it had expanded its relationship with Digital Island in San Francisco, by naming the company to deliver all of the online advertisements on its MSN network including MSN eShop, Search, Hotmail, Messenger Service and MSNBC.com Web sites. Digital Island, which provides e-commerce infrastructure services, had already been working for Microsoft, providing services like live and on-demand streaming media. Shares of Digital Island rose $1.69, or 84.5 percent, to $3.69. Allison Fass (NYT)
5/7/2001	Compressed Data; Microsoft to Put Digital ID Into Its Products	Microsoft plans to incorporate a user-identification approach into its operating systems and software products, and the company says the change could speed up business-to-business transactions and increase the level of confidence in those online transactions. The user-ID system, known as Identrus, employs a technology for identifying people and organizations online through the use of digital signatures -- unique identifiers that can be read and used by computer networks.
5/3/2001	Unearthing Office Tools Long Buried	WHEN you buy any ordinary product, like a lawn ornament or an electric toothbrush, you own it. You can put it on your grass or bathroom sink and admire it as a symbol of how far you've come. But software works more like a health club membership: the initial payment is only an entry fee. After that, you're expected to pay dues forever -- by buying the software company's yearly upgrades.
5/3/2001	Microsoft Is Set To Be Top Foe Of Free Code	Microsoft is preparing a broad campaign countering the movement to give away and share software code, arguing that it potentially undermines the intellectual property of countries and companies. At the same time, the company is acknowledging that it is feeling pressure from the freely shared alternatives to its commercial software. In a speech defending Microsoft's business model, to be given on Thursday at the Stern School of Business at New York University, Craig Mundie, a senior vice president at Microsoft and one of its software strategists, will argue that the company already follows the best attributes of the open-source model by sharing the original programmer's instructions, or source code, more widely than is generally realized.
4/27/2001	Microsoft and Qwest Form Internet Partnership	Microsoft, eager to expand its Internet access network to compete with America Online, announced an alliance yesterday with Qwest Communications International to deploy a version of the Microsoft service over high-speed lines in the 14 states where Qwest offers access. Under a five-year agreement, Microsoft and Qwest will together market both dial-up and digital subscriber line, or D.S.L., service under the Microsoft brand, with Qwest providing the connection and Microsoft the content and other online services, like the home page from which Internet surfers begin their journey.
4/26/2001	Let the Game Wars Begin	WHETHER consumers like it or not, millions of them -- perhaps even you -- will soon find themselves in the middle of a full-fledged war. It will be a battle for the hearts and minds and pocketbooks of all those interested, even mildly so, in playing video games on high-tech consoles plugged into their television sets. The first real salvo was fired by Sony about six months ago when it released Play Station 2, at the time the most advanced game console on the planet. Early this year, Microsoft offered a preview of its entry, Xbox, which promises to be even more powerful.
4/24/2001	CNBC.com To Be Merged Into MSN	Continuing to scale back its exposure to the Internet, NBC said yesterday that it would merge its CNBC.com site into the personal finance area of Microsoft's MSN site. Last month, NBC said it would buy back the public shares of its money-loosing Internet portal NBCi, substantially scale back the site and lay off most of its 350 employees.
4/21/2001	Murdoch May Make Another Offer to Acquire Hughes Electronics	Despite months of negotiations that have repeatedly led to dead ends, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, is expected to make yet another offer to acquire Hughes Electronics, the parent of DirecTV, on Monday, according to a person close to the negotiations. Hughes Electronics is controlled by General Motors, which is said to be seeking about $9.5 billion for its stake. Terms of the deal remain unclear, but it appears that the News Corporation is close to enlisting Microsoft to put up about $3 billion and to add its interactive television business, Ultimate TV, to the bid, an executive close to the talks said.
4/19/2001	If Microsoft Builds It, Will They Upgrade?	THE earthquake in Seattle in February -- while Bill Gates was demonstrating the new Windows XP operating system at a local hotel -- may seem like a mere thunder rumble compared with the impact on the marketplace when this latest version of Windows hits store shelves later this year. As Microsoft sees it, Windows XP has the potential to be its biggest leap forward in home operating-system software since Windows 95 was introduced. The new versions of Windows XP (the XP comes from eXPerience) one for the home and one for corporate users -- are expected to be released in the fall. Microsoft is promising to combine crash-resistant stability with a sparkling interface that is soothing, intuitive and easy to use for everyone from the newest of new users to grouchy network administrators.
4/19/2001	EUROPEAN UNION: MICROSOFT INVESTIGATION	The European Commission said it was ending an inquiry into Microsoft's cable TV activities in Europe after the company agreed to end arrangements it had with some of its cable company partners. Regulators worried that Microsoft could use its seat on technology boards at UPC of the Netherlands and NTL of Britain to squeeze out rivals in the market for the set-top boxes needed for digital TV.

4/18/2001	Some Suffer Tax Hangovers From Microsoft Option Spree	During the 1990's, Seattle echoed with tales of Microsoft millionaires, ordinary workers who became wealthy from stock options the company had awarded. Now that Microsoft's stock has fallen to about half its peak, Seattle is abuzz with other stories, those of Microsoft employees deep in debt and filing for bankruptcy.
4/11/2001	Humor Is at Center of Microsoft's New Campaign	Add Clippy, Microsoft's obnoxious on-screen paper clip with the irritating habit of popping up to offer computer help at all the wrong times, to the list of dot-com employees who will soon be searching for new jobs. Long assailed within the computer industry for routinely adding too many features to its software programs, Microsoft will tacitly acknowledge that criticism today when it starts a Web marketing campaign for its new Office XP software suite that ridicules its notorious Office help system.
4/9/2001	An Internet Critic Who Is Not Shy About Ruffling the Big Names in High Technology	David Winer is a software designer who loves making trouble. And even if many in Silicon Valley consider him an irascible gadfly, he has a large, attentive audience. Right now he is sounding the alarm about Microsoft, which he says is trying to contort network software standards in an effort to dominate the future direction of the Internet.
4/5/2001	SEARCH PROVIDER FOR NBCI AND EXPLORER	GoTo.com, an Internet search service, announced yesterday that it had signed an agreement with NBCi and renewed a deal with Microsoft to provide pay-for-placement search results for the two companies. Under the NBCi agreement, which will last two years, GoTo will provide sponsored search results to the 15 million users of NBCi Web sites. The Microsoft deal, originally signed in January of last year, offers sponsored results to those who use the search button on the Internet Explorer Web browser. GoTo, based in Pasadena, Calif., says it has more than 40,000 advertisers. It surprised analysts last month when it said its earnings would beat Wall Street expectations. Andrew Zipern
4/4/2001	F.T.C. DEAL ON ADS	Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have agreed to stop contending in advertisements that Pocket PC hand-held computers are capable of wireless access to the Internet and e-mail aime and anywhere, the Federal Trade Commission said. The agency said the ads failed to disclose the need for additional equipment like a modem for mobile access to the Web and to send or receive electronic messages. Microsoft developed an operating system for the Pocket PC and licensed it to manufacturers including Hewlett-Packard; in April 2000 the two companies began to advertise the Pocket PC in newspapers and other national publications. Though the ads contained the disclosure ''Modem required. Sold separately,'' the F.T.C. said it was ''inconspicuous and appeared in extremely fine print.''
4/2/2001	Corrections	A report in the Technology Briefing column of Business Day on Friday about Microsoft's plan to push its new Xbox video game player into the online game business in Japan misstated the number of game titles Sega would develop for Xbox. It is 11, not 5.
4/1/2001	Of Diversity and Microsoft	To the Editor: ''Bill Gates's Brain Cells, Dressed Down for Action'' (March 25) gave a sense of the brain trust planning Microsoft's future. But to what extent can members of Mr. Gates's inner circle truly bring, as the article says, ''a personality and perspective that diversifies the technological mix'' when six of seven are white, all are married (with children) and all are men? JENNIFER L. KAUFMAN San Francisco, March 25
3/31/2001	WARNING IS ISSUED ABOUT WEB BROWSER SECURITY FLAW	Microsoft warned consumers yesterday of a potentially dangerous security flaw in certain versions of its Internet Explorer Web browser. The flaw could allow an attacker to send a computer user an e-mail message containing a hidden program that could damage data on a computer or perform other functions. The security vulnerability, which affects Microsoft Explore 5.01 and 5.5, is particularly troubling because the illicit program could be executed on a victim's computer simply by trying to view a message containing HTML data. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard notation form for representing World Wide Web pages. The flaw could also be exploited by visiting a Web page that contained a hidden program that would be downloaded to a computer without the user's knowledge. In its bulletin, the company said the vulnerability could not be exploited if the file-downloads feature of the browser had been disabled. John Markoff (NYT)
3/30/2001	Web Users Left Scrambling as Big D.S.L. Network Shuts Down	The first bankruptcy of a major provider of fast Internet access sent more than 100,000 computer users scrambling to find new service yesterday as the nationwide network of NorthPoint Communications was shut down. The closing of NorthPoint's system -- which offered Web service to small Internet service providers in cities across the country, including hundreds of homes and businesses in New York -- came after AT&T reached a $135 million deal to acquire most of NorthPoint's assets, but not its customers.
3/30/2001	MICROSOFT OUTLINES JAPAN PLAN ON GAMES	Microsoft said it would push its new Xbox video game player into the online game business in Japan. Speaking at the spring Tokyo Game Show, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said the company would test online games before introducing the service commercially in Japan in the first half of 2002. He also said that Sega, which said earlier this year that it was withdrawing from the video game hardware business and canceling its Dreamcast system, would develop five Xbox game titles. John Markoff
3/27/2001	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Friday about a warning that someone had fooled VeriSign Inc. into issuing fraudulent electronic certificates -- encrypted messages used to verify transactions online -- in the Microsoft Corporation's name misstated the cause of a delay in canceling one certificate. VeriSign was waiting for a number of agencies to provide information verifying the transaction. It was not waiting for Microsoft to respond.
3/27/2001	MICROSOFT, COMPAQ AND OTHERS TO WORK ON TABLET PC	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would collaborate with the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Intel Corporation and the Transmeta Corporation to create a tablet-sized, wireless personal computer. The computers will be about the size of a piece of notebook paper, and will employ the next version of Microsoft's Windows operating system; users will be able to enter data with a stylus similar to those used with hand-held electronic organizers, officials said. With PC software sales beginning to slow, Microsoft has said it plans to produce software that could be used in smaller, mobile devices. Leland Rockoff, director of marketing and planning for the Tablet PC at Microsoft, said, ''Our aspiration is that in three to five years, input with pen or with speech will be as ubiquitous as a keyboard and mouse are today.'' Mr. Rockoff said that he hopes the new product would give the company a chance to make inroads among people who are not using a PC now. Microsoft and the other companies have not said how much the Tablet PC will cost; it is expected to be released next year.
3/25/2001	Bill Gates's Brain Cells, Dressed Down for Action; Pressed to Innovate, Microsoft Relies Again on an Inner Circle	LAST summer, even before Microsoft introduced its ambitious .Net strategy for moving its Windows operating system onto the Internet, its chairman, William H. Gates, was pursuing his next challenge. Mr. Gates wanted to replace the mouse-based point-and-click system of operating computers with something that would let machines converse directly with people. The idea of talking to computers is as old as ''Star Trek,'' but accomplishing it would be radical, as starkly different as Microsoft's Windows software was from its original PC-DOS operating system.
3/23/2001	Warning From Microsoft On False Digital Signatures	The Microsoft Corporation warned computer users today that someone posing electronically as a company executive had fooled VeriSign Inc, a provider of digital signatures, into issuing fraudulent electronic certificates in Microsoft's name. The false documents could potentially be used by software virus writers or other vandals trying to trick unsuspecting users into running hostile programs on their computers.
3/23/2001	I.B.M. OFFERS NEW SERVERS	Capping a busy week in the computer hardware world, where Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu introduced new server lines, I.B.M. announced four new servers that it hopes will help it compete better with Compaq Computer, the leader in the portion of the server market based on Intel microchips and Microsoft operating systems. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)
3/20/2001	Microsoft Seeks to Defuse Privacy Worries	Microsoft officials today tried to defuse privacy and security concerns about its new .Net Internet strategy by saying the new technology would let computer users control how much personal information they make available for commercial use. Questions about the privacy and security implications of a system that would collect virtually all personal information within a vast, unified computing system have increasingly plagued the Internet computing industry and e-commerce worlds in recent years, as embarrassing flaws have permitted computer vandals to routinely exploit weaknesses in supposedly secure systems.
3/19/2001	Companies Turn to Grades, And Employees Go to Court	An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies. At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone.

3/18/2001	Therapy for Dot-Com Survivors	'HI, I'm Jen, and I'm an entrepreneur. I work 72 hours a week.'' Pause. ''Sometimes I feel totally, utterly alone, like I'm on a rickety old bridge connecting huge gorges in an Indiana Jones movie. It's nice to know there are other people out there who feel the same way I do.'' Many in the audience nodded knowingly as Jen Dalton shared her growing frustrations of operating a fledgling business in an increasingly tough economy. The 65 others who had gathered at Microsoft's campus in Mountain View, Calif., to attend a half-day ''Sustainable Entrepreneur'' workshop last month took turns talking about their troubles. Many had seen their dot-com businesses fail in recent months, and they were there to take an ''honest look at the way they are running their lives and how it's not working,'' Nicholas Hall, 31, the workshop organizer, said.
3/15/2001	RECUSAL IN MICROSOFT CASE	The federal judge who ordered the breakup of Microsoft last April has said that he will not preside over a class-action racial discrimination suit filed against the company. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington was randomly assigned the case in January; seven current and former black Microsoft employees say the company discriminated against African- Americans in evaluations, compensation, promotions and wrongful termination. Judge Jackson, who cited the company's appeal of the landmark antitrust lawsuit as the reason for recusing himself, took one last shot at Microsoft, saying the company had an ''institutional disdain for both the truth and for rules of law that lesser entities must respect.'' A Microsoft spokesman said Judge Jackson's decision to step aside was an appropriate one. Microsoft has accused the judge of being biased and of committing substantive errors in the government's antitrust lawsuit.
3/13/2001	MICROSOFT AND EBAY FORM BROAD ALLIANCE	Microsoft and eBay said yesterday that they had entered into an alliance under which eBay's auction Web site would adopt some of Microsoft's software and Microsoft would make eBay's auction listings available on some of Microsoft's sites, like MSN. EBay has been a major customer of a Microsoft competitor, Sun Microsystems. EBay's chief executive, Meg Whitman, said her company would continue to use Sun computers and software for the company's back-end computing operations. Analysts said the strategic relationship was the first of a series of deals by Microsoft as it tried to start its Internet initiative, .Net. John Markoff

3/11/2001	PrivateSector; Another Bill as President? A Survey Picks Gates	William H. Gates has spent a lot of time fighting the government over whether his company, Microsoft, is a monopoly. So it may come as a surprise that if Americans had to hand over the government to the private sector, more would choose Microsoft to run it than any other company. A recent survey of 1,000 people by Brouillard Communications, a marketing and advertising agency in New York, showed that 28 percent would vote to turn over the government to Microsoft, followed by I.B.M., at 7 percent, and General Motors and General Electric, at about 5 percent each.
3/6/2001	MICROSOFT AND MAXTOR IN STORAGE ALLIANCE	Microsoft and Maxtor, a manufacturer of disk drives, said yesterday that they had formed an alliance to make data storage equipment designed to be attached to networks instead of to specific computers. The new devices, which use the Windows 2000 operating system, are part of the growing market for specialized storage devices that provide intelligent management of data at a lower price than general-purpose servers.

3/6/2001	SHARP TO SELL LINUX-BASED HAND-HELD COMPUTERS	Sharp Electronics, which leads Japan's market in hand-held electronic organizers, said it would challenge Palm and Microsoft in the United States later this year with a device running on the free Linux operating system. Sharp, which is based in Osaka, Japan, will be the first major maker of hand-held organizers, to market a Linux-based device, said Hiroshi Uno, general manager of the company's mobile systems division. The models will be available in the United States and Europe in October, Mr. Uno said. Hand-held computers made by Palm, Handspring and Sony use the Palm operating system, while the Microsoft Pocket PC uses a version of the Windows operating system.
3/5/2001	Compressed Data; Judges Use Laptops In Microsoft Appeal	Last week, while lawyers for the Justice Department and the Microsoft Corporation presented their oral arguments in the appeal of the antitrust case against the company, the judges hearing the appeal used laptop computers to communicate with their clerks and to study legal documents during the proceedings. The computers were equipped with the Microsoft Windows operating system and Internet Explorer as well as the Netscape Navigator Web browser -- software programs at the center of the case.
3/4/2001	Microsoft's Future, In Court and The Markets	FROM the burning pyre of technology stocks, an unlikely phoenix is beginning to rise from the ashes: Microsoft. The share price of Mr. Softie, as the company is sometimes called, is up more than 30 percent this year. That's a nice ride. But it is still down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high, reached last March 24.
3/4/2001	The Nation; For Justice to Be Blind, Must Judges Be Mute?	TWO events last week exposed a First Amendment paradox. Judges, who are charged to protect everyone else's freedom of speech, get less of it for themselves. The Supreme Court said Wednesday that the First Amendment prevented Congress from limiting the legal arguments federally funded lawyers can make on behalf of welfare clients. Yet, a day earlier, federal appeals court judges in Washington excoriated Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge who ordered the breakup of Microsoft, for giving interviews about the case both during and after the trial. This contrast may be perplexing. Free speech for judges brings benefits and dangers. On one hand, judges can increase general understanding of the law and legal institutions. Silencing them would deny the public much wisdom. On the other hand, no asset is more precious to the judiciary than public confidence that judges are above the fray, with no personal stake in how cases are decided. In this contest between speech and keeping the public's trust, judicial conduct codes generally opt to protect trust. They presume that when judges talk to the media about their own cases, they jeopardize that trust, even if their language is measured and restrained.
3/1/2001	Corrections	Excerpts in Business Day yesterday from oral arguments in the appeal of the Microsoft antitrust case, as transmitted by Federal Document Clearing House Inc., misattributed six quoted passages. Judge David S. Tatel, not Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards, was the source of comments beginning ''The only comment that I could find''; ''So if this court decides to set aside the remedy''; ''O.K. So then we go back to statements prior to the conclusion''; and ''Is that your theory?'' Judge A. Raymond Randolph, not Judge Tatel, made the comment beginning ''Is there any indication who initiated these interviews?'' Judge Edwards, not Judge David B. Sentelle, made the comment beginning ''Are there some that might suggest it violates the whole oath of office?'' Corrected excerpts appear at The New York Times on the Web: www .nytimes.com/tech.
3/1/2001	Putting A New Soul In Your PC	I HAVE used the Macintosh operating system for more than a decade, and Windows off and on since it became less annoying a few years ago, but the notion of trying Linux intrigued me. Could someone like me, without a computer science degree or past love affairs with a Radio Shack TRS-80, do anything with Linux -- like installing it on an old PC and getting it to do things I usually do on my I.B.M. ThinkPad or Mac G4 desktop-tower machine? Linux, the free, sturdy operating system created 10 years ago by Linus Torvalds of Finland, has been getting more and more attention in the last couple of years because it has a populist cachet and runs well on inexpensive hardware; Version 2.4 of the Linux kernel (the brains of the system) was released in January. It has made inroads in the server market, but it is also starting to show up installed on personal computers from major computer makers like I.B.M. and Dell as an alternative to Windows.
3/1/2001	Microsoft Fights Back	Rarely is a trial judge thrashed so publicly by an appeals court. Microsoft and its lawyers were undoubtedly pleased that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit focused as intently in this week's oral argument on the behavior of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson as on the company's own misconduct. But the software giant should not get too confident. The more than seven hours of testimony did little to undermine the soundness of Judge Jackson's central finding that Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust laws. The very strength of the government's case is what makes Judge Jackson's behavior especially lamentable. In particular, the judge's ill-advised public statements about the case -- for example, comparing Microsoft to a drug gang -- violate judicial norms and create the unfortunate impression that he may have been biased. As Harry T. Edwards, the Circuit Court's chief judge, rightly said: ''The system would be a sham if all judges went around doing this.''
2/28/2001	Judges Voice Doubt On Order Last Year To Split Microsoft	The government suffered a second difficult day of questioning in its Microsoft antitrust case today when a Federal appeals court cast doubt about a judge's order last year to break the company in two. Most of the seven judges on the appeals panel posed tough questions to a Justice Department lawyer about the justification for the breakup, noting in particular that the only companies ever broken up in the 111-year history of the Sherman Antitrust Act had been formed through mergers and acquisitions.
2/28/2001	Excerpts From Second Day of Arguments in Appeal of the Antitrust Case	Following are excerpts from oral arguments today in the Microsoft antitrust case before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House Inc. Representing Microsoft were Richard J. Urowsky and Steven L. Holley; John G. Roberts Jr. argued for the state attorneys general who have sued Microsoft along with the Justice Department. FOR MICROSOFT MR. HOLLEY -- As Mr. Urowsky has explained over the last two days, Microsoft believes that the district court's liability determinations are not sustainable. As a result, Microsoft believes it is not even necessary for this court to reach the issue of relief.
2/27/2001	Microsoft's Appeal Seems to Find Sympathetic Ears Among Judges	Judges on a federal appeals court pelted lawyers representing the Justice Department and 19 states with skeptical questions today about the decision last year that found Microsoft had repeatedly violated antitrust law. The questioning suggested that many elements of the decision were vulnerable to reversal. A majority of the seven judges sharply questioned the central findings of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson last year that Microsoft had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by trying to leverage its existing monopoly in the operating system market to gain control of new areas. A majority of the judges also appeared skeptical of the finding that Microsoft had violated Section 1 of the act by tying its Internet Explorer Web browser to its Windows operating system.
2/27/2001	Excerpts From Arguments in the Appeal of the Antitrust Case	Following are excerpts from oral arguments today in the Microsoft antitrust case before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service. Representing Microsoft was Richard J. Urowsky; John G. Roberts Jr. presented arguments for the 19 state attorneys general who have sued Microsoft along with the Justice Department. FOR MICROSOFT MR. UROWSKY -- These are appeals from a final judgment finding Microsoft liable under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and ordering a breakup of the company as well as other extreme relief.
2/26/2001	High-Stakes Appeal Could Be Last Court Date for Microsoft	After years of bruising setbacks before a deeply skeptical federal district judge, Microsoft moves upstairs in the court house on Monday morning. There it will find an appeals forum that in the past has been receptive to its antitrust defenses, but that now could also present potentially fatal pitfalls. Lawyers for Microsoft and its adversaries at the Justice Department will begin two days of oral arguments before seven appeals judges in a case of historic dimensions for consumers, the computer industry and the law. With no guarantee that the Supreme Court would agree to hear any further appeals, the judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit may wind up with the definitive word on the most important antitrust case in a generation.
2/23/2001	ANALYST CUTS MICROSOFT FORECAST	Microsoft could post fiscal third-quarter revenue $100 million to $300 million below analysts' consensus estimate, a Merrill Lynch analyst, Henry Blodget, wrote in a research note yesterday. He cited ''continuing deterioration of fundamentals across the technology industry'' in the quarter ending March 31. Mr. Blodget wrote that he was sticking with his estimate that Microsoft would earn 43 cents a share.
2/22/2001	Microsoft Outlook Add-On For Wireless Keeps You Posted	Microsoft recently took the wraps off a free Microsoft Outlook e-mail add-on called Outlook Mobile Manager, a program that automatically forwards urgent e-mail messages to any wireless gadget, like a Palm VII, a BlackBerry pager or a text-message-capable cell phone. Once you have taught the program which messages to forward, Mobile Manager uses artificial intelligence to decide which future messages are worth sending on to you. The program is available in prototype form at www.microsoft.com /outlook/mobile; the final version will be available in April. Of course, in solving one problem, Microsoft created another for itself: the monthly fees for many wireless devices, including cell phones and the Palm VII, allow only a certain amount of text to be transmitted each month; if you exceed the limit, you must pay an added fee.
2/22/2001	Microsoft Settles Suit With Bristol Technology	Ending a bitter three-year-old private lawsuit, Microsoft and Bristol Technology Inc. today agreed to a confidential settlement of a dispute over antitrust and unfair trade practices. A Microsoft spokesman said the suit was settled for an undisclosed sum that superseded an earlier court ruling that called for a payment by Microsoft to Bristol of $4.7 million. That amount included both punitive damages and lawyers fees, which Bristol had been awarded after Microsoft was found to have violated Connecticut fair trade laws.
2/19/2001	Gates Stays the Course on Software Integration	It might be called the validation of William H. Gates. Scheduled for the fall to take advantage of back-to-school and holiday sales cycles, the newest Windows operating system will be Microsoft's first significant product bearing the stamp of the company's famous co-founder in his role as chief software architect. He assumed that position when he relinquished the title of chief executive to his longtime friend Steven A. Ballmer more than a year ago.
2/16/2001	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about the introduction of the XP version of Microsoft's Windows operating system compared the timing incorrectly with that of Apple Computer's Macintosh OS X system.

2/15/2001	Ignore the Label, It's Flextronics Inside; Outsourcing's New Cachet in Silicon Valley	Dot-coms are collapsing right and left, and e-businesses are vanishing by the dozens, but here in a nondescript industrial park in the heartland of Silicon Valley, business is booming. And that is certainly poetic justice. Long ago -- before the advent of the World Wide Web -- companies here actually manufactured things. Now, with the bursting of the Internet stock market bubble last year, old-fashioned high-technology manufacturing is suddenly back in vogue.
2/15/2001	Indications Of New Vision At Microsoft	Since Microsoft introduced its ambitious Internet initiative last year, analysts and investors have pressed the company to articulate its amorphous and loosely defined vision. Yesterday, Microsoft gave the clearest signal yet that the future of computing, and its future, lies beyond the personal computer, the foundation of its business and still the source of about 70 percent of its revenue.
2/14/2001	Microsoft Introduces New Windows System	Stung by slowing personal computer sales and continuing antitrust battles, Microsoft introduced a new version of its Windows software today, one that it hopes will help restore the company to its glory days of the 1990's. Calling the 18-year-old Windows operating system ''the most successful software product of all time,'' William H. Gates, the company's co-founder and chairman, said the forthcoming Windows XP version would be ''the most important Windows release since Windows 95,'' a blockbuster that generated worldwide attention and made Windows nearly synonymous with personal computing.
2/13/2001	Metro Business Briefing; MICROSOFT TO THE RESCUE	Audible .com, a Silicon Alley company that develops and uses technology to place audio books, newspapers and lectures on the Internet, said in a call with investors on Friday that it had received an additional $10 million investment from Microsoft. Microsoft already owned a 7 percent stake in the company. Audible shares rose on the news Friday, but then dropped today. The shares, which are traded on the Nasdaq composite index, fell 28 percent, or 56 cents, to close at $1.46 yesterday in regular trading. Jayson Blair
2/12/2001	First Line of Defense; Chief Privacy Officers Forge Evolving Corporate Roles	Jules Polonetsky has the power of life and death. Over contracts, anyway. As the chief privacy officer of DoubleClick, the biggest Internet advertising company, Mr. Polonetsky has the authority to rip up contracts with companies that do not comply with DoubleClick's rules for protecting consumer privacy. In recent weeks, Mr. Polonetsky says, he has cut off a half-dozen clients whose sites did not meet DoubleClick's criteria, which include having a clear privacy page on the client's site and an easy way to opt out of data collection.
2/11/2001	The Nation; Let the Markets Rule, Sometimes	NO company in recent years has complained more loudly than Microsoft about Washington's regulatory power. From its perspective, the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit, which threatens to split the company in two, is an example of that power run amok. No wonder then, that some senior government officials -- like the Federal Communications Commission member who is now the F.C.C.'s chairman, Michael K. Powell -- found it incongruous when, late last year, Microsoft and several other corporations demanded that the government either impose strict conditions on the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner, or reject it.
2/11/2001	He Said Surfboard, Not Stanford	Lawrence J. Ellison didn't need a college degree to achieve success. Neither did William H. Gates, whom he describes as his former friend, nor Steven P. Jobs, whom he describes as a best friend now. When Mr. Ellison's 18-year-old son, David, told his father that he wanted to go to Stanford, Mr. Ellison suggested that he look elsewhere. ''What about Pepperdine?'' with its terrific surfing opportunities, he asked his son. ''It's in Malibu.''
2/7/2001	Format for Microsoft Appeal	The United States Court of Appeals set a format today for oral arguments in the appeal of the antitrust ruling against the Microsoft Corporation and made changes in the format the litigants had agreed to previously -- changes that seem to favor Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft and the company's legal adversaries, the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general, worked out an agreement at the court's request to divide the argument into segments dedicated to the various areas in which Microsoft has been found guilty, including illegal efforts to maintain a monopoly and illegal linking of two products.
2/7/2001	Hughes Nears Deal to Create Giant Satellite TV Network	The Hughes Electronics Corporation, the satellite television unit of General Motors that owns DirecTV, has moved closer to reaching a deal with the News Corporation that would create a global satellite network worth as much as $70 billion, according to executives close to the negotiations. Hughes has been talking with News Corporation for months over how to structure a deal that would combine the satellite television operations of the two companies and create additional value for G.M. shareholders. G.M.'s board met yesterday and was briefed on the current state of the negotiations and the outline of how the transaction would take place, the executives said.
2/3/2001	U.S. and Microsoft Agree On Procedure for Appeal	Microsoft and the government filed an agreement with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit today laying out the structure for their oral arguments later this month in the appeal of the antitrust ruling against the company. Last spring, a United States District Court judge ruled that Microsoft was in wide violation of the nation's antitrust laws and ordered the company broken in two. Microsoft immediately appealed, and both sides have been filing briefs with the appeals court the last several months.
1/31/2001	Europe's Technological Elite Discreetly Grins at U.S. Dot-Com Woes	The bursting of the Internet bubble last year has brought with it some changes in the pecking order at the World Economic Forum here, which concluded today. Gone are many of the United States-based dot-com executives who have in recent years preached that ''the Internet changes everything.'' Humbled also are members of the Silicon Valley technology elite who have played an increasingly visible role here but are now facing severe cutbacks.
1/30/2001	Interviews of Judge in Case Reflect Bias, Microsoft Says	Microsoft stepped up its attack yesterday on the judge who ordered the company split in two, saying that recently published interviews ''raised profound doubts about his impartiality and the fairness of the trial he conducted.'' Yesterday's legal filing was a response to a brief filed on Jan. 12 by the Justice Department. Microsoft argued anew that the government had not proved that Microsoft had ''monopoly power'' in the high-technology marketplace, and that the ''extreme'' decision by the trial judge to break up Microsoft was not justified by the facts of the case or by antitrust law.
1/28/2001	Skiing Maybe, but No Surfing	The 31st meeting of the World Economic Forum, which began last week in Davos, the Swiss ski village, is based on the theme of bridging divides. This year, each of the 2,300 business and government participants will leave the conference squarely a member of the ''information have'' camp, not the ''have not.'' Courtesy of the Microsoft Corporation, every attendee was given a $600 Compaq iPaq hand-held computer, complete with a wireless networking card. The devices allow participants to view their program guides, receive a ''message of the day'' from Klaus Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum and to exchange e-mail messages with one another -- creating what conference managers called the world's densest wireless network.
1/26/2001	Microsoft Sites Shut, This Time in Network Attack	A network attack kept most Internet users out of Microsoft's key Web sites for more than five hours yesterday, a day after an error by one of the company's own technicians closed the sites for nearly 24 hours. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, blamed a denial-of-service attack for crippling half a dozen sites, including its corporate home page at microsoft.com and its popular free e-mail service, Hotmail.com. Also shut down were MSN.com, Expedia.com, Carpoint.com and Encarta.com.
1/26/2001	MICROSOFT PLANS JAVA OFFENSIVE	Microsoft unveiled technology yesterday intended to translate programs written in the Java computer language so they can be used on Microsoft's .Net platform. .Net, an online extension of the Windows operating system, is intended to allow people to work over networks. Microsoft has created software to translate programs written in more than 20 computer languages for use on .Net. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it had agreed to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Sun Microsystems four years ago. Sun had accused Microsoft of making modifications to the Java platform. The move announced yesterday by Microsoft involves translating the Java programming language, which is only a part of the Java platform, Sun officials said. David Harrah, a Sun spokesman, said the technology did not appear to violate terms of the settlement. Matt Richtel (NYT)
1/25/2001	ERROR DOWNS SEVERAL MICROSOFT SITES	Microsoft took most of the day yesterday to fix ''an operational error'' that shut out millions of users from its group of Web sites starting Tuesday night. Sites including Microsoft.com, MSN.com, MSNBC.com, WindowsMedia.com, Expedia.com and Carpoint.com were unavailable nearly 24 hours. The problem also crippled some of the company's European Web sites. Adam Sohn, a Microsoft spokesman, attributed the problem to an incorrect configuration change by a Microsoft technician. The problem limited access to the domain name system, or D.N.S., server, which translates a domain name into a numerical Internet address. ''This was an operational error,'' the company said in a statement, ''and not the result of any issue with Microsoft or third-party products nor the security of our networks.'' Earlier, a spokesman ruled out a denial-of-service attack, in which a malicious computer program sends thousands of requests for information to a site, swamping the servers. Chris Gaither (NYT)
1/25/2001	NEW NETWORKING PRODUCTS FROM CISCO	Cisco Systems announced a new line of wireless networking products, designed to provide high-speed Internet access to laptop computers and hand-held devices, and said two major customers were already using the products. Microsoft and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill recently began using the newest version of the devices, called the Aironet 350 series, Cisco said. At the university, strong radio signals carry the Internet and e-mail access to the laptops of 3,400 freshmen, even through walls. North Carolina said it expected the network to connect 15,000 undergraduates by 2003. About 5,000 Microsoft employees have access to the network at their campus in Redmond, Wash., with plans to expand the access to 20,000 soon, Cisco said. Information sent across the wireless network is encrypted for security. 3Com unveiled a competing product for businesses, called AirConnect, earlier this week. Chris Gaither (NYT)
1/24/2001	Outlook for Changes at Sega Pushes Shares 19% Higher	The shares of Sega, the struggling video game company, bucked the downward trend in Japan's stock market and rose sharply today on speculation that it would soon focus on developing game software for rival manufacturers' hardware. Jiji Press, a Japanese news agency, reported that Sega intended to disclose an overhaul plan later this month, calling for Sega to start supplying games for the PlayStation 2, made by Sony, a major competitor. The report said that Sega was considering a similar relationship with Microsoft, which plans to introduce its X-Box game console this fall. And game developers said Sega was already far along in its plans to develop software for the Advanced Game Boy from Nintendo.
1/24/2001	Microsoft to Pay $20 Million to Settle Lawsuit Over Java	Putting one legal hurdle behind it, Microsoft has agreed to pay $20 million to Sun Microsystems to settle a four-year-old lawsuit over Microsoft's use of the Java programming language, the companies said today. Under the agreement, the companies ended the licensing contract at the center of the dispute, which gave Microsoft the right to incorporate Java, the most popular language for programs that run on the World Wide Web, into the Windows operating system.
1/22/2001	Microsoft Starting A National Campaign	Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., is beginning a new national campaign today, aimed at businesses, carrying the theme ''Software for the agile business.'' Microsoft, which spends more than $200 million for campaigns aimed at businesses, hopes the campaign will convince companies that Microsoft can help them achieve their goals in the digital world.
1/19/2001	Microsoft Sees Some Good And Some Bad	Capitalizing on strong sales growth for its Windows 2000 desktop operating system at the end of the year, Microsoft reported quarterly earnings today that met Wall Street's scaled-back expectations. The company reported record revenue of $6.59 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, an 8 percent increase over the $6.11 billion for the 1999 quarter. Net income and diluted earnings per share were $2.62 billion and 47 cents a share, up marginally from the $2.44 billion, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. The earnings per share met a consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts reported by First Call/Thomson Financial.
1/19/2001	Microsoft Proves a Lure After Internet Stints	At a recent orientation for about 200 new employees at the Microsoft Corporation, Joseph Vansyckle found he was hardly alone in raising his hand when the company's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, posed a question. Just how many of these ''new employees,'' Mr. Ballmer wondered, had actually worked at Microsoft before? ''There were about 10 to 15 hands in the air,'' said Mr. Vansyckle, a product manager who had left the software giant in 1999 for stints at Drugstore.com and Amazon.com, both based in Seattle, before returning to Microsoft's Redmond campus this month. Many had gone off to local Internet companies or other high-technology start-up ventures, and had exciting if nerve-wracking tales to tell of their experiences.
1/18/2001	Microsoft Gives Boost To Outlook for Macintosh	Not all the good news for Mac fans comes from Apple; Microsoft recently offered some good news, too. First, the company announced that it will be updating its popular Office 2001 software suite to run on Apple's Mac OS X, which goes on sale March 24 and works best with software specially written for it. Second, Microsoft has announced a new program that's of little value to solo Mac users, but huge import to Mac renegades in corporations: a Macintosh version of Outlook, the e-mail, address book, calendar and collaboration program that anchors the PC lives of millions of PC workers. This completely rewritten program replaces the earlier, poorly regarded Outlook Exchange Server for Macintosh.
1/14/2001	You Win Some, Lose Some, And Then There's Florida	David Boies is now a software industry analyst: at a fund-raising dinner for the Manhattan Theater Club last week, Mr. Boies, always direct, said in a conversation that the declining stock price of Microsoft reflected the aftermath of last year's antitrust trial, in which he successfully argued on behalf of the government for breaking up the company. With the case on appeal, he said, ''they're like a defendant that's been convicted and is awaiting sentencing; they're on their best behavior.''
1/13/2001	Clinton Team In Final Plea On Microsoft	Submitting its final filing in its antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation, the Clinton administration asked an appeals court today to uphold the order to split the company in two. The brief argued that the company's appeal, filed last November, was nothing more than a recitation of the same arguments that failed the first time they were offered in court. Microsoft's argument that the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court, committed numerous procedural errors during the 18-month trial is ''groundless,'' the government's brief says. And Judge Jackson's remarks about Microsoft to journalists and others ''provide no grounds for inferring bias or partiality,'' despite Microsoft's assertions to the contrary, the government contends.
1/12/2001	UNISYS OFFERS VOTING SYSTEM	Unisys, Microsoft and Dell said they would join forces to develop technologies for electronic voting using the Internet. The e-@ction Election Solution could be used to run efficient elections at the city, county or state level, said Unisys, which has already produced electronic voting systems used in Brazil, Costa Rica and the city of Rome. Interest in alternatives to antiquated voting systems has been high since the Florida presidential election debacle, and many companies have claimed to have a part of the solution to the nation's electoral needs. Unisys, however, says that its system offers a fully integrated approach that incorporates voter registration, voter identification and ballot casting and counting, as well as quick and accurate reporting of results.

1/12/2001	Primer on the Popular Instant Messaging Services	Instant messaging has much in common with two other big uses of the Internet: Web surfing and e-mail. Tens of millions of people spend hours using it -- often while at work -- but it remains unclear whether the companies that provide the service can ever make money from it.
1/12/2001	Back to the Fold for a Former Microsoft Employee	In a twist on the trend of failed Internet start-ups sending workers back to former employers, Microsoft's first official hire is returning to the fold. Marc McDonald, an early programming whiz originally hired in April 1976 by an Albuquerque company then known as Micro-Soft, rejoined recently as part of the company's acquisition of a five-year-old Seattle electronic publishing company called Design Intelligence.
1/11/2001	Game Market Awaits Microsoft's Black Box	INTRODUCED to the world with all the fanfare the Defense Department reserves for new multimillion-dollar fighter jets, Microsoft's much-anticipated entry in the video game console market, the Xbox, was unveiled this week by the company's chairman, William H. Gates. Although the chunky, black game machine won't go on sale until later this year, the reverberations of the software giant Microsoft's striding into the $6.9 billion console game market -- the almost exclusive domain of Nintendo, Sega and Sony -- are already being felt.
1/10/2001	SOME MIGHT CALL IT HEAVEN	Microsoft and LaZ-Boy Inc. said they were teaming to sell the first ''e-cliner,'' a Web-television-enabled reclining armchair. La-Z-Boy's Explorer model comes with a keyboard and a Sony receiver for Microsoft's WebTV, and buyers will get two free months of the interactive television service. The chair's left arm has a fold-out tray table with a keyboard that connects to the receiver using an infrared beam, a 120-volt outlet with a surge protector and ports for high-speed and standard Internet access lines. In the right arm, meanwhile, are a drink holder and storage space. Users must provide their own TV and phone lines. The WebTV chair sells for $1,049 to $1,299, compared with $299 to $1,800 for unwired models. Microsoft's WebTV Plus service costs $24.95 a month.
1/8/2001	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Thursday about a discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft by current and former employees referred incorrectly to another case won by Willie E. Gary, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. That case, against the Walt Disney Company, involved copyright infringement, not discrimination.
1/6/2001	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the Microsoft Corporation's move into consumer electronics misstated the timing of an appearance by William H. Gates at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It is today, not tomorrow.
1/5/2001	New Focus for Gates Is Consumer Electronics	The bearish news from the personal computer industry may be sowing fear in Silicon Valley, but none of that anxiety is apparent on the sprawling corporate campus of Microsoft, whose software fortunes were built on the PC boom. For even with domestic PC sales down 24 percent in December from a year earlier -- and even as Microsoft is warning that its own revenues are likely to falter as a consequence -- the frontier of consumer electronics is increasingly seen here as the next big thing.
1/4/2001	Other Windows On the Web	ARE you a geek? Take this enjoyable self-test in the comfort of your own home. Just answer a single question: How many Web browsers can you name? 0: You've been out of the country for a few years, haven't you? 1-2: Very good; you probably named the Big Two, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.
1/4/2001	New Bias Lawsuit Is Filed Against Microsoft	Seven former and current employees of the Microsoft Corporation filed a lawsuit today contending that the company had engaged in racial discrimination in its employment practices, and seeking certification as a class action on behalf of all former and current black Microsoft employees. The suit, filed in federal district court here, builds on a discrimination suit brought in June by Rahn D. Jackson, a former account executive for Microsoft. Mr. Jackson's complaint was refiled today to include the six other plaiontiffs.
1/4/2001	Starbucks and Microsoft Plan Coffeehouse Web Access	The Starbucks Coffee Company and the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that they would join forces to offer wireless access to the Internet from Starbucks coffeehouses. The companies said they would work with the MobileStar Network Corporation of Richardson, Tex., which has already begun installing high-speed wireless connections in hotels and airports, catering to business travelers using e-mail and the World Wide Web.
1/2/2001	'Old' Dow Outperforms the New	The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.2 percent last year, leaving it looking better than either the Standard & Poor's 500, which fell 10.1 percent, or the Nasdaq composite, which plunged 39.3 percent. But the Dow's loss could have been smaller. A significant part of its decline came from Microsoft and Intel, the two technology stocks added in late 1999 in an effort to bring the Dow more in line with the new technology. Without the changes, the Dow would have been down just 3.1 percent.
1/1/2001	TECHNOLOGY: Real-Time Challenges, in Cyberspace and on the Ground; Old-Line Giant Works to Shape Post-PC World	Will Microsoft continue to dominate the computer industry by moving the operating system from the PC to the Internet? Last summer, the world's largest independent software company decided to wager that the future of the operating system will be in a cloud of Internet-connected computers spread around the globe.
12/26/2000	Microsoft Waits for Bush's Position on Its Antitrust Case	Microsoft executives may have cheered as loudly as anyone this month when it became clear that George W. Bush would be the next president. If statements by Mr. Bush and his advisers in recent months are any indication, the Bush administration seems willing to walk away from the resounding court victory the Justice Department won in the antitrust case against Microsoft this year.
12/22/2000	Great Plains Software Purchased by Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation agreed today to buy Great Plains Software Inc. for $1.1 billion in stock in a deal that seeks to improve Microsoft's line of products for small and medium-size companies. Microsoft said it would swap 1.1 of its shares for each share of Great Plains, a pioneer in computer-based accounting that is based in Fargo, N.D. That values Great Plains at $45.65 a share, or 29 percent more than Tuesday's close. Great Plains shares jumped to $48 at midafternoon today, but closed at $46.56. Microsoft rose $1.94, to $44.88.
12/22/2000	The Fed's Challenge: How to Cope With a Burst Bubble	ALAN GREENSPAN thought it might be a new era. History, the Federal Reserve chairman said in January, may conclude that ''at the turn of the millennium, the American economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation, which propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits and stock prices at a pace not seen in generations, if ever.''
12/22/2000	MICROSOFT INQUIRIES MAY MERGE	The European Union's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, confirmed that the union was actively considering combining two antitrust investigations of Microsoft's business practices, a development that lawyers in Brussels have been predicting since late November. The move would make it easier for the union to demonstrate a pattern of anticompetitive behavior by the company, but may slow the inquiry down, lawyers said.
12/21/2000	Corrections	A picture caption on Monday in the special Outlook issue of Business Day, with an article about Microsoft's business strategy, misspelled the surname of a project developer for the company. He is Burt Keely, not Kealy.
12/18/2000	For Microsoft, a Shift Toward New Vistas	This will be remembered as the year Microsoft abandoned its PC-centric view of the world. Having successfully turned to confront the threat of the Internet in December 1995, the surprisingly agile software maker pirouetted once again last summer, this time proclaiming that it will build a computer operating system directly into the fabric of the Internet.
12/15/2000	Microsoft Cuts Its Projections For 4th Quarter	Echoing recent warnings from the computer makers that are its most prominent customers, Microsoft said yesterday that earnings and revenue in the current quarter would be lower than previously projected because of weakening economic conditions. Microsoft attributed its reassessment to a slowdown in personal computer sales, a slight softening in corporate purchases of information technology and weaker-than-expected growth in demand for online advertising and its Internet service, MSN.
12/14/2000	Corrections	A headline in Business Day yesterday about a lawsuit brought against Microsoft by temporary employees who accused the company of improperly denying them benefits misstated the outcome. The suit was settled for $97 million; the workers did not win it.
12/14/2000	Browser Alternative	To the Editor: I read the review of the huge shortcomings of Netscape 6 (State of the Art, ''Netscape 6 Browser: Mixed Bag,'' Nov. 30), and I live with those of Internet Explorer 5.5, but I am baffled as to why your columnists and readers don't mention a splendid alternative to those oversized, bumbling twins. I refer to Opera, the small, speedy, versatile and truly standards-compliant browser that runs rings around Netscape and IE. It's available from www.opera.com. (I just downloaded the latest version, 5.0 2 megabytes) in 11 seconds on a D.S.L. line.)
12/14/2000	New PocketPC Player Makes Video Portable	When most proud parents want to boast about their kids, they usually get by with a few dog-eared photos tucked in a wallet. This week, Microsoft announced a piece of software that will allow owners of digital assistants using Pocket PC to also bring along home movies of the little ones with them everywhere they go. ''It's a new capability,'' said Michael Aldridge, lead product manager of Microsoft's Windows Digital Media Division. ''But I think people are really going to latch onto it when they see how it allows them to carry video with them and share it.''
12/13/2000	GAME MAKER JOINS XBOX EFFORT	Ending several months of speculation in the video game industry, Electronic Arts said it planned to make titles available for the forthcoming Microsoft game console, the xBox. Microsoft hopes the xBox, scheduled for a fall 2001 introduction, will provide competition to the Sony Playstation and other leading consoles, for which Electronic Arts already makes titles. Robbie Bach, chief xBox officer for Microsoft, said that the decision by Electronic Arts, the largest independent game maker, to also support xBox ''raises the profile'' of the game system. Electronic Arts said it would make 10 unspecified titles available within six months after xBox appears. Electronic Arts shares rose $1.94, or 4.9 percent, to $41.69. Matt Richtel (NYT)
12/13/2000	Temp Workers At Microsoft Win Lawsuit	Microsoft agreed to pay $97 million yesterday to settle an eight-year-old class-action lawsuit in which thousands of temporary employees accused the company of improperly denying them benefits. Microsoft reached this settlement, one of the largest ever received by a group of temporary employees, after the workers had sued the company, maintaining that they were actually permanent employees, not temporaries, and therefore deserved the same benefits as regular workers.
12/13/2000	You Can't Speed Up the Stork, but You Can Track Him Online	IT used to be that babies arrived after the rabbit died and the stork delivered. Now the sound of the mouse clicking is another precursor to childbirth, and a slew of Web sites can make the expectant mother feel more ready for the mysteries of motherhood. Instead of neighbors, godmothers and medicine women, there are sites to tell you anything you want to know, and a few things you do not want to know, about having a baby. (See links to leg cramps, hemorrhoids and varicose veins at www. babycenter.com's calendar for Week 28, for instance.) As in any sphere of the World Wide Web, advice on what to buy and where to buy it flows like mother's milk.
12/8/2000	Conference Seeks to Balance Web Security and Privacy	Trust us. Please? That is the message from leaders of high-technology businesses and advocacy groups at SafeNet 2000, a Microsoft-sponsored conference on computer security and privacy.
12/7/2000	RIVAL TAKES ON NETSCAPE AND EXPLORER	In a move to grab market share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer and America Online's Netscape, the two leading Internet browsers, Opera Software has released a free version of its latest browser, Opera 5.0. About 1.5 million users have paid $39.95 for the Opera browser, known for its speed and full array of features despite its small two-megabyte size. The free version will carry banner advertising. Jon von Tetzchner, chief executive of Opera Software, which is based in Oslo, said the company would work with smaller Internet service providers who view themselves as competing with the Microsoft Network and America Online. ''Releasing a free version of Opera is opening doors for us to get distribution deals with smaller I.S.P.'s and portals,'' he said. Mr. Von Tetzchner said Opera Software was working with wireless manufacturers to offer a version of the free browser on hand-held devices. Catherine Greenman
12/7/2000	Microsoft Media Player Even Throws In a Snowman	Microsoft released a mini-upgrade of its Windows Media Player 7 this week that includes some holiday-theme material. The most practical inclusion is a software tool for converting MP3 audio files to Windows Media Audio format. Because the Windows Media music format is much more compact than MP3, Microsoft says, the conversion can allows users to double the amount of music stored on their hard drives. But not all portable music players support Microsoft's format.
12/5/2000	Metro Business Briefing; DONATIONS TO CLUB TECH	As part of an initiative to help end the so-called digital divide, Microsoft Corporation will give $88 million in software and $12.3 million in cash to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America over the next five years, William H. Gates, the company's chairman, and a phalanx of politicians announced in Harlem yesterday. The initiative, Club Tech, an expansion of a pilot begun in 1999, will establish or augment computer facilities and instruction at the more than 2,600 clubs worldwide. The computers and Internet connections are supplied by PowerUP, a nonprofit organization founded last year that works with companies like America Online, Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard. Speaking to more than 100 children at the Dunlevy Milbank Boys and Girls Club yesterday, Mr. Gates said the gift would help the clubs expand on ''neat new things.'' He added, ''In fact, I'm envious that you have something far better than what I had as a kid,'' He was speaking of the club's technology room, which he toured earlier in the day.

12/5/2000	MICROSOFT JOINS IN CINEMANOW FINANCNG	CinemaNow, a leading distributor of independent feature films on demand over the Internet, announced today that it had closed another round of financing during which it had gained Microsoft as an investor, joining the original investors Blockbuster and Kipco. CinemaNow's majority owner is Lions Gate Entertainment through its recent acquisition of Trimark Pictures. Judith Berck
12/3/2000	IN BRIEF	Avis Chief's Parachute Could Be Solid Gold Just a year after being named the chairman and chief executive of Avis Group Holdings in East Garden City, A. Barry Rand, 56, is in line to leave the company with a $15.1 million severance package. Mr. Rand, who is black, became one of the country's leading minority executives last November when he accepted the top post at Avis, the rental car company. This fall, the Cendant Corporation of New York acquired the company for $1.5 billion and assumed debt.
12/1/2000	MICROSOFT BRINGS A BANKER IN-HOUSE	Richard Emerson, a former managing director at Lazard Freres and co-head of its technology and telecommunications advisory services, will join Microsoft as senior vice president of corporate development and strategy. Mr. Emerson, who is 38, will take charge of Microsoft's corporate development activities, including mergers, acquisitions and partnerships. He previously worked in Lazard's San Francisco office. Mr. Emerson worked on deals including SBC's acquisition of Pacific Telesis, its wireless joint venture with BellSouth, and its purchase of Sterling Commerce and Gemstar's merger with TV Guide, among others.

11/30/2000	In High-Tech Home The Future Is Now	GADGETS here. Gadgets there. Which one to buy for the ultimate techie holiday gift? How about a fully networked home stocked with dozens of computerized goodies connected to one another like so many blinking colored bulbs on a Christmas tree? Don't expect to see a kit for one of these homes at your local electronics store. But leading software and hardware developers are building such showcase homes across the country to demonstrate to consumers what is possible today and in the near future with home-based digital technology.
11/29/2000	Corrections	A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about the Microsoft Corporation's appeal of the antitrust ruling against it referred incorrectly to some of the people shown. Three were lawyers for Microsoft; two were spokesmen for the company. They were not all lawyers. From the left, they were Richard J. Urowsky of Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing Microsoft; James W. Cullinan, a company spokesman; William H. Neukom, the head of Microsoft's legal department; Mark Murray, a spokesman; and Steven L. Holley of Sullivan & Cromwell.
11/29/2000	MSN and 'N Sync Are Joining Forces	The MSN Network unit of Microsoft is teaming up with 'N Sync, the popular ''boy band'' singing group, on an elaborate marketing campaign aimed at younger consumers. MSN will introduce a co-branded Internet access service named 'NSync@MSN that will offer subscribers features like an electronic newsletter, photos and video footage, as well as 'N Sync versions of the MSN Messenger instant messaging service and Microsoft Windows Media Player.
11/28/2000	Excerpts From Microsoft Brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington	Following are excerpts from the Microsoft brief submitted yesterday to the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, seeking to overturn the District Court's antitrust ruling: Microsoft's Design of Windows Is Not an Unlawful Tie . . . The district court held that Windows and IE are separate products because ''consumers today perceive operating systems and browsers as separate 'products,' for which there is separate demand.'' The district court thereby rejected this court's June 1998 decision, stating that this court's test was inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in Jefferson Parish and Kodak.
11/28/2000	Microsoft Asks Appeals Court To Void Ruling	Firing the opening salvo in its appeal of a landmark antitrust case, the Microsoft Corporation said today that the trial judge who ordered its breakup had committed a host of procedural and substantive errors. In a brief that framed the legal issues for seven judges on the United States Court of Appeals here, the company acknowledged that it was an aggressive player but said it did nothing to exclude Netscape, its main competitor in the Internet browser business, from the software market, and therefore could not have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.
11/28/2000	Company's Latest Move Has Ring of Familiarity	The decision today by the Microsoft Corporation to seek the removal of Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson from any future proceedings in its antitrust case on the ground that he was prejudiced against the company had a ring of familiarity. In the last five years, Microsoft's lawyers have twice persuaded the appeals court here to disqualify other judicial officers after complaining that they were biased.
11/23/2000	Converting WordPerfect To Microsoft Word	Q. Is it possible to convert my WordPerfect 6.0 files to Microsoft Word 97? What might happen to the files when converting them? A. Yes, you can convert your old DOS or Windows WordPerfect files to Microsoft Word 97. One way is to use the tools that come with Word 97. The Typical installation option of Word 97 (and Word 2000) contains WordPerfect text and graphics converters that make the process fairly painless. If you have the minimal version of Word 97 on your computer, you may have to add WordPerfect converters to your copy of Word from the original program disk. To install them, rerun the Setup program and select Converters and Filers in the Add/Remove box.

11/20/2000	Compressed Data; Competing Visions of the Next Computer	Is the pen mightier than the television? That may be the question for Microsoft and Sony, which are spinning competing visions of the tablet computer.
11/16/2000	Microsoft Sets Sights On Tablet PC Market	It's apparently not enough that Windows runs about 90 percent of the world's laptop and desktop computers. Microsoft now wants to capture a market that does not yet exist: tablet PC's. In a keynote speech that opened the annual Comdex computer show in Las Vegas this week, Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, described a new class of PC, which the company is encouraging computer makers to adopt. He displayed a working prototype of a tablet PC, one of a handful in existence.
11/15/2000	Liberties; Mistrust In The Trust	Finally, Al Gore got wise. He has called in America's leading trust-buster.
11/15/2000	A Man Who Vanquished Microsoft Takes On G.O.P.	At his first public appearance today on behalf of the Gore campaign, David Boies, the latest big-name lawyer to join the vice president's legal team, discounted a comparison to his role as the victorious trial attorney retained by the government in the Microsoft antitrust case. But in fact Mr. Boies is clearly hoping that the kind of crucial insight and strategic decision he made in the Microsoft case may yet work again in the legal battle for Florida's electoral votes.
11/10/2000	Microsoft Hears Little Criticism at Its Annual Meeting	Despite a bumpy year in the stock market, an uncertain future in the courts and shareholder dissent over some of its political contributions, the Microsoft Corporation presented a relatively upbeat picture of the company at its annual meeting here today. While Microsoft, the world's largest software company, is promoting initiatives built around cellular phones, digital cameras and televisions, the company's leaders said their focus remained where it had always been: on personal computers. ''Some of our competitors will tell you that this will be a world without personal computers some day,'' Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, said. ''They're wrong.''
11/9/2000	New Mice: See How They Run	HISTORY has not been kind to the computer mouse. It emerged from military research to help with ''augmenting human intellect,'' as its developer, Douglas Engelbart, put it in his financial application. Thirty-two years ago next month, the first public demonstration of a mouse was enough to attract an attentive crowd at a computer technology conference. Today, at best, most computer users give their mouse as much thought as, say, the handle of their refrigerator. At worst, for some people, jabbing and jiggling a mouse all day can contribute to various hand-numbing repetitive stress injuries.
11/9/2000	Microsoft Sees New Software Based on Pens	From the late 1980's through the mid-90's, one software company after another, from start-ups like the Go Corporation to giants like Microsoft, pursued the same vision: a computer that would take its orders from a pen. And one after another they failed, sometimes infamously. Now Microsoft is betting that the time and the technology have arrived.
11/8/2000	OUTSIDER TO MANAGE MSN SITES	In an effort to attract people to its MSN Internet portal, Microsoft has turned for the first time to an outside company to manage two MSN online communities. Participate.com., a Chicago company that manages online communities for Cisco Systems, and Hewlett-Packard, has been chosen to manage MSN's People and Chat and Zone.com communities. Terms of the deal were not released, but a spokesman said the contract was Participate .com's largest so far.
11/7/2000	CIVIL JUDGMENT AGAINST MICROSOFT	A federal judge in Connecticut issued a final judgment yesterday in a private antitrust suit against Microsoft brought by Bristol Technologies, ruling that Microsoft must pay $3.7 million of Bristol's legal expenses. The case centered on a ''software bridge'' that Bristol had developed to ease the creation of programs that could run on both the Unix operating system and Microsoft's industrial-strength counterpart, Windows NT. Bristol accused Microsoft of unfair business dealings. Microsoft is considering an appeal, and Bristol says it plans to ask for a new trial. John Markoff (NYT)
11/6/2000	Another Contestant Wades Into E-Book Format Wars	Consumer demand for books to be read on screens remains largely theoretical. A trio of software companies -- Microsoft, Adobe Systems and Gemstar-TV Guide International -- have been racing ahead to push formats for publishing electronic books, designed to make them more difficult to copy and easier to read. But their competing formats are incompatible. Now, the competition to set a standard for electronic publishing is about to become even more confusing. Reciprocal, a small company that provides Random House, Time Warner, and other publishers with digital distribution services for all three formats, is introducing a fourth of its own, the first one for both personal computers and the popular Palm series of digital organizers.
11/6/2000	A New Chapter at Microsoft	Much has been written about Microsoft's brain drain and the continuing string of newly minted multimillionaires leaving for early retirement. So how to explain Dick Brass, who made millions during a decade at the Oracle Corporation and made even more as an early investor in the wireless company Omnipoint?
11/6/2000	Ex-Rival Helps Microsoft Find Wireless Future	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a request from Microsoft to limit briefs in its antitrust case referred incorrectly to those whose briefs the company opposed. Not all supported the government; two groups -- the Association for Objective Law and the Center for the Moral Defense of Capitalism -- sought to file in support of Microsoft. Later developments are reported today on Page C4.
11/4/2000	Corrections	In a procedural ruling partly in favor of Microsoft in its appeal of the antitrust decision that could split the company, a federal court ruled yesterday that America Online must join with three industry trade groups if the company wants to file a supporting brief. But the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will permit multiple briefs to be filed in the case, opposing Microsoft's effort to limit the filings to just a single supporting brief for each side.
11/4/2000	Ruling on Procedure in Case Is Partly in Favor of Microsoft	Kinokuniya and Microsoft announced an alliance in which the Japanese bookseller will open an online store that uses Microsoft's technology for the secure distribution of electronic books in Microsoft's Reader format. The site will open in early 2001 for English language titles and in mid-2001 for Japanese language ones. Miki Tanikawa
11/2/2000	. . . BUT FACES HOMEGROWN COMPETITION	The Microsoft Corporation asked a federal appeals court today to forbid nine organizations and individuals who support the government antitrust suit against the company, including America Online, to file court briefs in the case. Alternatively, Microsoft stated in a three-page brief it filed this morning, all nine should be asked to combine their thoughts into one 25-page brief.
10/31/2000	Microsoft Tries to Keep 9 From Filing Briefs in Antitrust Case	The News Corporation, which had planned to sell part of its global satellite businesses to the public next month, has postponed the sale because of market conditions, a person close to the company said yesterday. News Corporation had planned to spin off a stake in Sky Global Networks, which contains the company's satellite businesses in places including Britain and Asia. Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corporation, is interested in using Sky Global to acquire DirecTV, the satellite business owned by the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors, people close to the matter have said.
10/31/2000	News Corp. Delays Spinoff of Part of Sky Global Networks	Howard A. Schmidt's staff called with troubling news late in the day on Tuesday, Oct. 17. ''Some accounts were being created that did not match our normal audit logs,'' Mr. Schmidt, the corporate security officer for the Microsoft Corporation, said yesterday. A new account gives a user access to parts of a computer network, and the creation of accounts is carefully monitored by companies like Microsoft. New accounts that were not created by the usual procedures raised a red flag: a computer intruder could be working his way into the software giant's network.
10/29/2000	Irregular New Accounts Alerted Microsoft to Network Intruder	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson says he knows his rulings in the Microsoft antitrust case are controversial, but he has no regrets, even though, as he put it today, ''virtually everything I did may be vulnerable on appeal.'' Speaking to an antitrust conference sponsored by George Mason University, Judge Jackson said a breakup of the company, which he ordered in June, ''was never my remedy of choice.''
10/28/2000	Trial Judge Comments on Microsoft Ruling	Unidentified intruders had access to Microsoft computers for about six weeks and were able to view some of the source code -- a programmer's basic instructions -- for a future software product, the company said yesterday. Several people close to the investigation said the company believed that the online intruders had exploited vulnerabilities in the computer of a Microsoft employee working remotely, possibly at home, and used it as a passageway to the corporate network.
10/26/2000	The Web Gets a New Dashboard	FANS and foes of the Microsoft Corporation can certainly agree on one thing: Microsoft hates to lose. Whether competing for market share in Web browsers, handheld computers or corporate servers, Microsoft spends whatever years and dollars are necessary to produce the dominant product -- or at least the one with the most features. So it is easy to imagine the company's frustration when its Microsoft Network, the MSN online service, scarcely made a dent in the popularity of America Online, despite several revisions and years of marketing.
10/26/2000	MICROSOFT SETTLES WEBTV COMPLAINT	Microsoft's WebTV unit settled Federal Trade Commission charges that it misled consumers by saying its TV-based Internet browser gave viewers the same ability to surf the World Wide Web as computer users. In a settlement with the F.T.C., WebTV Networks Inc. agreed to distribute consumer-education brochures and advertising to correct any impression that the television-based Web browsing service provided the same access to the Internet that consumers could get with a personal computer. The Microsoft unit also agreed to reimburse some consumers for long-distance charges they did not expect to incur for connecting to the Internet by way of WebTV.
10/26/2000	AOL Seeks Permission to File Brief in Microsoft Appeal	America Online today asked a federal appeals court for permission to file a supporting brief in the appeal of the Microsoft antitrust case, noting that the plaintiffs in the case -- the federal government and 19 states -- support the idea while Microsoft opposes it. An America Online executive testified on behalf of the government during the trial, and Microsoft called him back as a hostile witness during the trial's rebuttal phase.
10/23/2000	The Prizes Are Ready, But the E-Books Aren't	Conceived about a year ago by Dick Brass, a vice president of Microsoft, the Frankfurt eBook Awards were intended to publicize the idea of reading from a screen and to encourage the publication of new electronic books. But at the Frankfurt Book Fair last week, they provoked widespread derision instead.
10/19/2000	Office Renovated For Mac	MICROSOFT WORD 2001 for the Macintosh just came out this month, and as someone whose first choice for word processing is Word on a Mac, I am apprehensive. Like many writers, I still have fond memories of Word 5.1, which was released in the early 90's and was a straightforward, yet powerful word-processing program that didn't complicate the task of writing. I found the next version, Word 6.0, to be a wheezing, bloated mess of recycled Windows code that was confusing to use and took no advantage of the built-in elegance of the Macintosh operating system. I still have the 13 or so floppies that it came on, though, because they do make a nice set of matching coasters for parties.
10/19/2000	Microsoft Handily Beats Estimates, Aided by Windows	Pointing to the strongest quarter ever for its Windows operating system, Microsoft yesterday surpassed analysts' earnings estimates for the latest quarter. After the stock market closed, the company reported first-quarter earnings of 46 cents a share, up from 40 cents a year earlier and handily topping analysts' expectations of 41 cents, as reported to the First Call/Thomson Financial market research firm.
10/18/2000	A High-Technology Festival Takes a High-Anxiety Turn	This year's theme for Agenda, a computer industry conference that annually draws some of high technology's best and brightest, is supposed to be ''Who's got the juice?'' But for most participants, caught in the dreadful stock market downturn of an industry once thought to be the shining symbol of a long economic boom, the theme has instead become ''Where did the juice go?''
10/17/2000	Oregon and Washington in Anyone's Guess Column	Having awarded their electoral votes to Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 and to Bill Clinton in the next two presidential elections, Washington and Oregon would seem to be immensely hospitable terrain for a Democratic aspirant to the White House -- perhaps so much so that neither major party candidate would worry much about bothering with campaigning here. But not this year.
10/12/2000	With New Office Suite for the Mac Microsoft Does More Than Windows	The Microsoft Corporation today released a new version of its popular Office suite for the Macintosh. This newest version underscores how the Macintosh market has continued to diverge from the mainstream of the PC world, because although it is similar to the Windows Office suite, it has some intriguing differences that relate to its history, and to the habits of the Macintosh faithful.
10/12/2000	Appeals Court in Compromise On Microsoft Case Timetable	The United States Court of Appeals announced a schedule today that would bring the two sides in the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust appeal back into the courtroom at the end of February. The court ordered Microsoft to file its first appeals brief by Nov. 27, with the government's reply due by Jan. 12. Final briefs are due on Feb. 9, and arguments are set for Feb. 26 and 27.
10/10/2000	EMACHINES AND MICROSOFT TEAM UP	EMachines and Microsoft have agreed to produce an Internet device specifically for Microsoft's MSN online service. The device will cost $400 and be called the MSN Companion. It will be based on a 200-MHz National Semiconductor Geode microprocessor and will join specialized appliances from companies like Compaq, America Online that are intended to make surfing the Web and using e-mail simpler and less expensive. The eMachines appliance will be sold through Circuit City, Office Depot, some Wal-Mart stores and other retailers. It will be promoted with a $400 rebate for customers who commit themselves to a three-year, $21.95-a-month subscription to the MSN service. Microsoft's move toward devices like the MSN Companion and other nonpersonal computers is a reversal. Its executives once ridiculed the idea of such specialized computers. John Markoff
10/10/2000	Why PlayStation 2 Isn't Child's Play; Early Shipment to U.S. Halved, and Some Fault Intricate Chips	The Sony Corporation raised the blood pressure of millions of American parents recently when it announced that its initial shipment of PlayStation 2, the cutting-edge entertainment device that is expected to be the hottest gift of this holiday season, would be half what it had promised. Only 500,000 machines will arrive in stores on Oct. 26, not a million, Sony said. It blamed a shortage of components but has refused to specify which parts are involved, creating one of the year's more intriguing technology mysteries.
10/9/2000	Microsoft to Hold Party in Washington	The Microsoft Corporation has been celebrating its 25th anniversary -- ''25 years of technology innovation,'' as Microsoft puts it, by one of the most phenomenally successful companies in history. Last month, the company held a huge anniversary party at Safeco Field in Seattle, and it was attended by 15,000 employees. Microsoft also published an anniversary book listing every employee's name, 39,510 in all. And on Tuesday, Microsoft will throw another big anniversary party in Washington.
10/5/2000	Microsoft Is Target of a Bias Lawsuit	The Microsoft Corporation is being sued by a former employee who says that a subjective job evaluation process discriminates against black and female employees. Microsoft ''permits managers, who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit,'' Monique Donaldson, a former program manager at Microsoft, says in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court by the law firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll.
10/4/2000	U.S. Seeks Faster Filing Schedule in Appeal of Microsoft Case	Trying to demonstrate that the appeal of the Microsoft verdict can be handled quickly, the Justice Department proposed a schedule for the filing of documents in the case today, two days earlier than scheduled, and called for a filing period half as long as the one Microsoft proposed on Monday. ''As the court has recognized,'' the government wrote, the case is ''of exceptional importance.'' And because the trial judge in the case stayed the judgment and remedy against Microsoft until appeals are complete, it said, ''it is essential for effective antitrust law enforcement in a critical sector of the nation's economy that the appeal should be concluded expeditiously.''
10/3/2000	MUSICMATCH UPGRADES ITS JUKEBOX	While the music file-sharing service Napster fights a battle over the legality of its software in a courtroom in San Francisco, MusicMatch, a San Diego company that makes software for storing and playing music on home computers, is waging a different kind of battle over market share. The company is releasing a new version of its jukebox software today that gives users the ability to customize their selections. MusicMatch, which claims 10 million users, is fighting to gain market share from RealNetworks, whose RealJukebox software has 45 million users, as well as from Microsoft, whose Windows Media Player comes installed on many new PC's. Susan Stellin
10/3/2000	Microsoft Seeks an Extended Appeals Process	The Microsoft Corporation asked a federal appeals court today to allow more than five months for the filing of documents in the appeal of the antitrust ruling against the company, and to permit a brief four times as long as usual. Microsoft's appeal would run 56,000 words -- half the length of an average book, or the equivalent of a dozen or more newspaper pages without headlines or pictures. All of this is needed, the company's lawyers told the court, because ''the scope of the case is monumental.''
10/2/2000	Issues for the Supreme Court; Mr. Rehnquist's Dilemma	Chief Justice William Rehnquist took the occasion of last week's Supreme Court decision turning the government's case against Microsoft back to a lower court to air a personal ethical dilemma. In a brief statement, Mr. Rehnquist explained that he had decided not to disqualify himself from participating in the court's deliberations on Microsoft even though his son, James Rehnquist, is part of a team of lawyers defending Microsoft against rival companies in a private antitrust case. Mr. Rehnquist's openness about the situation is praiseworthy. For a judge to reveal the thinking behind a recusal decision is all too rare. But disclosure alone cannot cure the underlying problem here, which is preserving public confidence in disinterested decision-making by the nation's highest court.
9/29/2000	ALLEN LEAVES MICROSOFT BOARD	Microsoft said yesterday that its co-founder Paul G. Allen and the former Hewlett-Packard executive Richard Hackborne were resigning from the board. Mr. Allen and William H. Gates founded Microsoft 25 years ago to market the BASIC computer language to hobbyist computer users. Later, on the strength of a contract from I.B.M. to development MS-DOS, a simple personal computer operating system, Microsoft grew into the world's dominant independent software publisher. Mr. Allen, through his Vulcan Ventures, is a powerful force in new media and other technology companies. He left Microsoft in 1982 when he contracted Hodgkin's lymphoma, but had remained a board member. He owns 3.5 percent of Microsoft's stock. John Markoff (NYT)
9/28/2000	MICROSOFT TO OFFER HIGH-SPEED ACCESS	Microsoft said yesterday that it would begin selling a high-speed online service at RadioShack stores. The MSN HighSpeed service will be available on telephone lines from the NorthPoint Communications Group and by satellite from a unit of Gilat Satellite Networks, beginning in November. It will cost $39.95 a month for a phone connection and $59.95 for a satellite link.
9/28/2000	Rooting for WordPerfect	To the Editor: The statement that ''WordPerfect wins hands down by one measure: price'' is only true, sadly, if you assume that the new word processing user is actually choosing to buy the word processor. But many computers are sold with the Microsoft product included at no additional charge with their newly purchased computer. So purchasers of new computers often find their choices to be between accepting the free Microsoft Word or, after declining that, purchasing WordPerfect. For most, the choice is obvious.
9/28/2000	Corrections	Two picture captions in Business Day yesterday with an article about the Microsoft antitrust case were reversed and carried incorrect or incomplete credits. Judge Harry T. Edwards was at the left (photo by Craig Herndon of The Washington Post) and Judge David B. Sentelle at the right (photo by Ray Lustig of The Washington Post).
9/27/2000	Company Is Taking Its Case Into More Familiar Judicial Waters	The court that will next hear the appeal of the government's antitrust case against Microsoft has dealt with some of the company's legal arguments in the past, handing the company its most significant victory before today. In 1998, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision ordering Microsoft to take its Internet Explorer Web browser out of its Windows 95 operating system. Two of the judges in that case remain among the seven judges who will now hear the appeal.
9/27/2000	At Microsoft, Still Business According to Strategy and Plans	Microsoft has long maintained that the government antitrust case would do nothing to alter its business practices or long-term strategy. And today, as it won at least a procedural victory in the case, the company had another opportunity to make its point. In recent months, Microsoft has accelerated a range of business and technical initiatives, continuing its strategy of adding software applications to its operating systems -- like the browser that brought on the antitrust scrutiny -- and moving into new computing markets ranging from the largest mainframes to the video-game business.
9/27/2000	JUSTICES DECLINE A DIRECT APPEAL IN MICROSOFT CASE	The Supreme Court handed a major tactical victory to the Microsoft Corporation today when it rejected the government's plea to hear the appeal of its landmark antitrust case immediately and instead returned the proceeding to a lower court. The decision gives Microsoft greater breathing room to pursue its appeals, relieves the company of any pressure to return any time soon to the bargaining table and, in the absence of a settlement, could have the effect of prolonging a final court judgment by a year or longer.
9/26/2000	MICROSOFT REPORT	As the Supreme Court prepares to say whether it will take the Microsoft antitrust case, the public relations war is accelerating. Yesterday, the pro-Microsoft Association for Competitive Technology released a study by a University of Texas economist that asserts that the government's proposed remedy of splitting Microsoft into two companies will cost consumers worldwide $125 billion to $310 billion in higher software costs over three years. The study, written by Stan J. Liebowitz, suggests that after a split of Microsoft, the resulting two new competitors will ''depart from Microsoft's traditionally low pricing practices.'' John Markoff
9/22/2000	MICROSOFT EXPANDS IN IRELAND	Underscoring Ireland's growing attractiveness as a high-technology center in Europe, Microsoft said it would establish an Internet data operation in Dublin to distribute software products and to handle sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The company said that the data center would purchase bandwidth from the Irish government's joint venture with the telecommunications giant Global Crossing. Brian Lavery
9/21/2000	It's a Word World, Or Is It?	HOW do you compete in a business where the next-largest company holds a market share hovering just under 100 percent? That's the quandary WordPerfect faces. A federal judge ruled last spring that Microsoft held a competition-stifling monopoly in personal computer operating systems with a market share of roughly 85 percent. But Microsoft's worldwide dominance in word processors is even more complete, hovering between 93 and 95 percent, by most estimates. So when Dave Ludwick, a senior manager at the Corel Corporation, the Canadian company that owns WordPerfect, said, ''We are pursuing a strong niche strategy,'' he may seem overly optimistic at first glance.
9/20/2000	Justice Dept. Antitrust Chief to Step Down	Joel I. Klein, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division and chief architect of the government's case against the Microsoft Corporation, announced today that he would be stepping down at the end of next week. Mr. Klein's departure will come within days of the Supreme Court's decision whether to review the order proposed by the government to break up Microsoft after a court's findings that the company bullied competitors, stifled innovation and repeatedly violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
9/18/2000	Microsoft Loses Key Strategist To Retirement	With the retirement last week of Paul Maritz, Microsoft lost a field general from the company's bitter computer wars of the 1990's. It was Mr. Maritz, a soft-spoken technologist who came to Microsoft from Intel in 1986, who oversaw the Redmond, Wash., company's rise to operating system supremacy.
9/18/2000	A Tale of the Tape From the Days When It Was Still Micro Soft	As Microsoft celebrates its 25th anniversary this month, the company is unlikely to call attention to another formative event 25 years ago: the day someone stole Bill Gates's software. But the heist, now shrouded in equal parts mystery and industry folklore, gave an early glimpse of the hard-nosed approach Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has long taken to the software business. And the fierce debate that the theft ignited a quarter-century ago remains relevant today, as the industry engages in a war of words and lawsuits over whether computer software and digital information should be bought and sold or freely shared.
9/15/2000	NEW WINDOWS VERSION RELEASED	Microsoft began selling the new Windows operating system for consumers yesterday, giving the world's largest software maker a new product for home computer users in time for the holiday shopping season. Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows Me, is now available in stores and will be included in new machines from PC makers including Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. The new operating system replaces Windows 98.
9/14/2000	MICROSOFT ACQUIRES MUSIC WEB SITE	Microsoft said yesterday that it had acquired MongoMusic, a Redwood City, Calif., producer of Web-based digital music technology. The MongoMusic.com Web site allows consumers to sample music and create their own ''stations'' of favorite tunes. Founded in June 1999, the company was originally financed by Nokia and Sony. Microsoft officials said they found MongoMusic attractive because of its history of strong relationships with the recording industry. With the acquisition of MongoMusic, Microsoft is expanding its MSN network of Web sites, which already includes the WindowsMedia.com music site. The value of the acquisition was not disclosed, but industry sources estimated it at $65 million. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
9/11/2000	When the Judge Can't Really Judge	Are today's technology issues too complex for the typical judge to judge? That is a question implicity raised by Microsoft, which in its federal antitrust appeal has contended that the trial it lost was so technical and esoteric that the presiding judge was unable to comprehend the facts.
9/10/2000	Gates's Party Animal? Basic Donkey	Steve Ballmer jumped out of a giant birthday cake. And Bill Gates showed off a computer program he wrote in the Basic code language a long, long time ago for a video game (involving a car and a donkey) that seemed, well, more than a bit primitive today. ''It's very powerful,'' Mr. Gates said to a chorus of guffaws from a crowd of about 15,000 Microsoft employees last week. ''Honestly. This was really cool.''
9/7/2000	Microsoft Device Shows Gamers Just Who's Talking the Talk	For online gamers, the ability to speak through the Internet to other players while playing has obvious advantages. But it also has the potential for trouble. ''If you're in the middle of a combat game and you're strategizing with your team mate, it's important not to let your opponents hear that,'' said Isabella Carniato, Microsoft's Game Voice marketing manager. But making those Internet voice connections and then keeping track of who is hearing what can sometimes become as complicated as determining the next step in destroying the enemy in some cyberbattle.
9/6/2000	Celebrating in Seattle	The Vodafone Group, the world's largest mobile phone company, said it was teaming up with Microsoft to develop wireless Internet services. The products will offer Microsoft applications for access to the Internet using mobile devices and will be commercially available next April. Financial terms were not disclosed.
9/6/2000	VODAFONE AND MICROSOFT IN WIRELESS DEAL	Seeking to promote the rapid development of electronic commerce between businesses, I.B.M., Microsoft and Ariba plan to announce a proposal on Wednesday to create a huge set of online registries of products and services to help automate business transactions. Twenty-nine companies, including American Express, CommerceOne, Compaq, Merrill Lynch and Sun Microsystems, will initially endorse the proposal, to be named the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration project, or UDDI. The backers said they planned to turn the idea over eventually to one of several Internet standards bodies to make it a broadly backed initiative.
9/5/2000	Plan Aims to Foster Electronic Commerce Between Businesses	This summer, Microsoft executives have been coyly popping a videotape into a VCR here and showing visitors the computer-age equivalent of the blinding power of a race car dragster on nitro fuel. The tape reveals a photo-realistically rendered schoolroom where an invisible hand is poised to drop a table-tennis ball with an X on it. As it falls, the viewer sees that it is about to land in a sea of 1,024 similar balls, each perched on a hair-trigger mousetrap.
9/4/2000	Patents; Devices to make life around the house easier for handymen, cooks and computer users.	LABOR DAY celebrates industry and work with the ultimate salute: a day off. The rest of the year, inventors strive to find ways to make work and everyday tasks easier. Roofers who install tiles on houses may appreciate a pair of work shoes patented by James Mills. He has invented footwear with adjustable pitch, so that a roofer, or a firefighter or chimney sweep, standing on a steep roof can remain upright. His shoes are actually shoe boards that fit over the foot, with or without conventional shoes. The boards attach to a base that holds a contact pad made of foam rubber. Brackets extending from the underside of the shoe board to the top of the base are connected with a rod. A series of holes in the brackets allow the pitch of the footwear to be adjusted with a pin to match the slant of a roof. A wearer would use the shoes standing with one leg down roof from the other. Mr. Mills, who lives in Valparaiso, Ind., received patent 6,035,557.
9/2/2000	Microsoft Told To Pay Million To Small Rival	Questioning the truthfulness of statements made by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, a federal judge has awarded $1 million in punitive damages to a small Connecticut company that brought an antitrust suit against Microsoft. The ruling late Thursday in Bridgeport, Conn., was hailed as a vindication by the plaintiff, Bristol Technologies. Bristol was the developer of a ''software bridge'' intended to ease the creation of programs that could run on both the Unix operating system and Microsoft's industrial-strength counterpart, Windows NT.
8/31/2000	New Software Being Offered By Microsoft to Catch AOL	For years, it seems, nothing in the software world has been more ubiquitous than the America Online discs offering free online hours. Now Microsoft, which has had trouble gaining ground against AOL in the online-service market, is preparing a new marketing push to woo subscribers. And for the first time it will offer its own mass-distributed software for users of its Internet service, MSN.
8/31/2000	STATE JUDGE RULES MICROSOFT CASE CAN GO ON	A state superior court judge in San Francisco has allowed the first class-action suit to proceed against the Microsoft Corporation based on allegations that the software company used its monopoly to harm California consumers. Many similar suits have been filed across the country since Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court in Washington ruled that the company had violated federal antitrust laws. In the California case, Superior Court Judge Stuart R. Pollak said an unspecified number of California consumers could be represented in one trial to determine whether they were forced to pay unreasonably high prices for Microsoft Windows, Word and other products. Microsoft said it was reviewing the ruling. No trial date has been set. Lawrence M. Fisher (NYT)
8/29/2000	Competing Alliances Set In Electronic Book Field	Stepping up the competition to define a standard format for electronic publishing, Microsoft and Adobe Systems both announced rival alliances intended to strengthen their respective positions in the growing market. The companies produce competing software programs intended to make reading on a screen easier on the eyes.
8/28/2000	Report Questions a Number in Microsoft Trial	How many applications dance on the head of a hard drive? In his antitrust ruling against Microsoft, federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson argued that a crucial barrier confronting the company's potential competitors are the 70,000 programs written to run solely on the Windows operating system.
8/25/2000	Video Game Giants to Fight Battle Royal in United States	The home video game industry is about to embark on what is certain to become a bitter and bloody year of new technology and cost-cutting, which many people in the business say will claim one or more victims. Nintendo offered the opening move today at the Spaceworld video-game trade show in Tokyo, announcing both a new home console based on an I.B.M. PowerPC microprocessor and a new version of its handheld Game Boy portable system.
8/23/2000	Microsoft Asks Case Be Denied Fast Track	The Microsoft Corporation made a final plea yesterday to the Supreme Court to send its antitrust case to a federal appeals court for the ''onerous task'' of reviewing the record instead of hearing the appeal directly. Microsoft's plea came in a legal brief that answered a filing last week by the Justice Department, which urged the Supreme Court to hear the appeal directly. A fast-track appeal directly to the top court, the government said, was in the national interest because waiting for the appeals court to act could ''irreparably harm competition'' in the computer industry and could result in justice being ''denied through delay.''
8/21/2000	Dictionary Publishers Going Digital	A logomachy -- n. an argument about words -- is brewing on the Web. Houghton Mifflin plans to publish the fourth edition of the American Heritage dictionary next month, the volume's first major overhaul in eight years. The new edition is full of changes sure to arouse lexicographers -- color illustrations, notes on slang and a new appendix describing Semitic as well as Indo-European roots.
8/17/2000	Appliance With A Purpose	ABOUT half of all American households now have personal computers, a trend that is astonishing considering that PC's are expensive, complicated and unreliable, compared with other household appliances. Conversely, about half of all homes have managed to resist buying computers until now. That annoys the Microsoft Corporation, which hates the idea of the country being divided in two. (Microsoft hates the idea of anything being divided in two.) Microsoft's mission statement calls for a computer -- Windows-based, naturally -- in every home. That sounds like a swell idea to Compaq, the world's largest maker of Windows-powered PC's. So earlier this week, Compaq and Microsoft teamed up to introduce the iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1, a $199 home computer designed for people who don't like computers.
8/16/2000	High Court Urged to Hear Microsoft Appeal Quickly	Declaring that the outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case could affect nearly every person who uses a computer, the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court yesterday to hear the company's appeal quickly so ''that justice is not denied through delay.'' The Supreme Court can hear direct appeals in civil antitrust cases brought by the federal government if it thinks the expedited review is in the national interest.
8/16/2000	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday about an effort by Linux software developers and computer manufacturers to compete with Microsoft's Office applications misspelled the surname of the chairman of the Eazel Corporation. He is Mike Boich, not Boiche.
8/14/2000	The Medium Gets The Message; TV's Monoliths Have Learned The Web Is a Fragmented World	If there were any established companies ready-made for the Internet, they should have been the big television networks. Or at least that was how it seemed two years ago. ''We have what is needed to compete because of the great depth in our brands and the great consumer loyalty to them,'' Michael D. Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, said in 1998 on the eve of the debut of Disney's Go Network.
8/14/2000	Linux Backers Plan Assault On Microsoft	A group of key Linux software developers and major computer manufacturers are planning to announce on Tuesday at a Silicon Valley computer conference the first effort to compete directly with Microsoft's Office suite of applications for the personal computer. Until now, the free Linux operating system has had its greatest impact in the computer server market, where many Internet service providers and World Wide Web applications and service companies routinely use the program.
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: Yesterday I typed, ''Summertime and the living is easy,'' and my Microsoft Word for the Mac grammar checker corrected me (or should I say Ira?) to ''Summertime and the living are easy.'' I was wondering how to posthumously inform Mr. Gershwin of his error. LEWIS GOODMAN New York
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: The column about how a Mac fan survives in a Windows world seems to imply that there are no genealogy programs for the Mac. I have been using Reunion for several years on my Mac. I particularly like the ability to attach pictures and documents to individual names. KALMAN MILLER Somerset, N.J.
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: ''For Mac Users, Help From an Unlikely Quarter'' (State of the Art, Aug. 3) offered tips on Mac and Windows compatibility. You might want to know about an excellent Windows program, MacDrive 2000 by MediaFour, that sells for $59 and and will read Mac disks in Windows. It works with floppies, Zip disks and CD's. DR. MURRAY DAVID SCHANE New York
8/10/2000	MICROSOFT NAMES .NET CHIEF	Microsoft said yesterday that Robert Muglia, a longtime executive, would head its new .Net Internet strategy. In June, Microsoft shifted its focus from desktop software to services offered on the Internet. Mr. Muglia will be group vice president of the .NET Services Group, which will develop the software and services that will make up the new .Net business. Also yesterday, Microsoft said that David Cole would lead the personal services platform division, which will provide network services for the new business; Brian MacDonald would develop premium services for the .Net effort; and Kai Fu Lee, now at Microsoft's research laboratory in Beijing, would head a new user interface technologies division. John Markoff
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: J. D. Biersdorfer wrote, ''It's never easy living as a Mac user in a Windows world.'' Give me a break. Most of the software I use daily -- Digital Performer and Metasynth, for example -- is not even available on Windows. A lot of it has only recently been made available for Windows, like Media Cleaner, Pro Tools and Unity DS-1. I guess if you are slaving away in some cubicle, you may think you need Office whatever, but Apple Works does fine by me. Who needs Windows? WILLY DALTON Paterson, N.J.
8/8/2000	MICROSOFT'S BOARD APPROVES SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company, said yesterday that its board had approved a share-buyback program to acquire stock for its employee stock-option and stock-purchase programs. The program took effect yesterday, and Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., said the number of shares to be purchased would be based primarily on the level of employee stock options exercised. Shares of Microsoft were up 87.5 cents yesterday, to $70, on the Nasdaq stock market.
8/7/2000	Online Superstore Pushes Into Digital; Barnesandnoble.com Stakes Turf Despite Bloodied Stock and Losses	Stephen Riggio remembers telling executives at Barnes & Noble that the Internet was the future of bookselling in 1994, before Amazon.com had even begun. But he has never gotten much credit for it. By the time he founded Barnesandnoble.com, in 1997, Barnes & Noble had become watchwords for letting an Internet upstart eat your lunch. Last week should have been heartening. Amazon.com lost its president, missed its revenue projections and saw its stock plummet amid doubts about its ability to branch into new markets. One Lehman Brothers analyst even questioned how long the company would be able to pay its bills.
8/3/2000	Now Yelling at Your PC Can Actually Be Useful	Frustrated Web surfers who yell at the computer when they can't find something online now have a little friend who won't take it personally. One Voice Technologies has just released IVAN, a voice-activated onscreen servant of sorts, who never loses his cool. IVAN, which stands for Intelligent Voice-Activated Navigator, appears on the browser screen as a small cartoon character resembling a smiling globe with skinny legs. (Web surfers not enamored of such anthropomorphic whimsy can choose to turn off the visual aspect of the program.) Instead of the traditional Web point-and-click action, users can simply tell IVAN things like ''Show me the current price of Cisco stock'' or ''I need to buy a book,'' and the software will present a Web site or a page of search results that matches the spoken keywords. Although the IVAN program will not restrict access to any pages, companies that are partners with One Voice will usually be at the top of the hit list.
8/3/2000	For Mac Users, Help From an Unlikely Quarter	IT'S never easy living as a Mac user in a Windows world, but it is a lot easier than it used to be. Microsoft, maker of Windows, was once thought to be Apple's greatest enemy. I will admit to referring to Microsoft as ''the Borg'' (taken from the dominating alien race on ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'') in those dark days of '97 when Apple's future looked shaky. But then things got better. Instead of trying to squash the Mac, Microsoft has actually spun off a unit to create Mac software from the ground up, instead of merely recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its programs. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.5 browser for the Mac featured many technogoodies, like a page-print preview option, that were not included in the concurrent Windows versions, and Internet Explorer 5 for Mac has even more.
8/1/2000	Institute Gets $12.5 Million To Listen for Faraway Life	Two gifts totaling $12.5 million have cleared the way for the development of what is being described as the world's most powerful radio telescope designed specifically to listen for signals that may be coming from civilizations elsewhere in the galaxy. The SETI Institute of Mountain View, Calif., a private organization conducting research to determine whether intelligent life exists beyond Earth, announced yesterday that the money would be used to begin work on a proof-of-concept version of the telescope. Under current plans, the telescope, a cluster of many 12-foot dish receivers, would be ready for full operation in 2005.
7/31/2000	New Economy; AOL's rivals want to see its instant messaging system open up before a merger makes the company any bigger.	TO hear some rivals of America Online talk about it, the case for opening up its instant messaging service -- or I.M., as it is known in the trenches -- is a struggle between the forces of democracy and those of autocratic rule. ''Mr. Case, on behalf of the I.M. industry and users everywhere, tear down this wall!'' Ross Bagully, chief executive of an America Online rival, Tribal Voice, said in testimony before the Federal Communications Commission last Thursday, after a speech by AOL's chairman, Steve Case. ''Users of I.M., like users of e-mail and the telephone,'' Mr. Bagully said, ''deserve the right to free and open communication.''
7/29/2000	Corrections	An article in Business Day on July 17 about Microsoft's plans for new software technologies to manage information overload misstated the company's relationship to an artificial intelligence company, Knowledge Industries. While Microsoft bought parts of it in 1993, the company remains independent; it was not wholly acquired.
7/28/2000	STING LOSES ON DOMAIN NAME	The British pop star Sting lost his attempt to claim the Internet address sting.com at the World Intellectual Property Organization. In separate decisions, the board ruled in favor of Microsoft and Reuters in disputes over domain names. Sting became the first celebrity to lose at the Geneva-based organization, which ruled in favor of the Hollywood actress Julia Roberts in a similar dispute. In Sting's case, he could not prove that Michael Urvan of Marietta, Ga., had registered sting.com in bad faith. Mr. Urvan denied that he had sought $25,000 from Sting for rights to the name, and Sting's lawyers produced no evidence. Sting's lawyers could still appeal to a court in the United States. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
7/27/2000	Microsoft Files Brief Asking Supreme Court to Send Antitrust Case to Appeals Court	In a legal document filed yesterday, Microsoft argued that the government's antitrust case is ''completely unsuitable for direct appeal'' to the Supreme Court because it is complex and because the trial judge made ''serious and substantive procedural errors.'' Microsoft wants its appeal to go first to the federal appeals court in Washington, which ruled in favor of the company in a related case.
7/24/2000	Warming Things Up, At Least Temporarily	It may not be ''Sex and the City,'' but relationships in the computer industry often run from frosty to passionate awfully quickly. Just look at that old yin-yang pair, Apple and Microsoft. In the Microsoft antitrust case, the longtime adversaries traded charges once more, depicting even their apparent armistice in 1997 as a kind of corporate hostage deal. Apple testified that Microsoft threatened to stop development of its popular Office suite for the Macintosh, unless Apple agreed to distribute Microsoft's browser. Microsoft replied that Apple was blackmailing it with a long-running patent dispute and paid it $150 million to stop the harassment.
7/24/2000	Making Money Vs. Doing Good?	Silicon Valley entrepreneurs fall into two categories, John Doerr, the Valley's most prominent venture capitalist, told a group of Internet executives last week. There are the missionaries, he said, and there are the mercenaries. ''Missionaries obsess on the customer,'' explained Mr. Doerr, a partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. By way of an example, he offered Jeff Bezos, the somewhat embattled chief executive of Amazon.com, a Kleiner investment.
7/21/2000	COOKIE MANAGEMENT FOR EXPLORER	Microsoft said yesterday that it would test several privacy-enhancing ''cookie'' management features for its Internet Explorer Web browsing software. Cookies are small files placed on the hard drives of Web site visitors, and are often used to capture data about online behavior for personalization and advertising purposes. Microsoft said the new features, which had been distributed to 2,000 test subjects, would offer users more information about the types of cookies used and their origins, and would make it easier for them to track and delete the files.
7/20/2000	MICROSOFT ADDING LONG-DISTANCE	Microsoft plans to announce today the availability of a technology that will allow consumers to make free long-distance phone calls in the United States and Canada while using the company's MSN instant messaging service on the Internet. The technology, which uses a network belonging to Net2Phone, a leading Internet telephony company, is expected to increase the popularity of making phone calls over the Web. Simon Romero
7/19/2000	Microsoft's Profits Advance 9% With Help of Portfolio Earnings	The Microsoft Corporation slightly beat Wall Street's expectations yesterday as its quarterly profits rose more than 9 percent, even though revenues were flat. The leading software company had its biggest lift in its fiscal fourth quarter from a surge in earnings from its swelling portfolio of cash and equity investments. Microsoft executives cautioned that investment earnings should drop in the current quarter. But they then delivered an optimistic outlook for the current fiscal year, which begins this month, saying the company expects revenues to rise 15 percent the next year with earnings gaining roughly 10 percent.
7/18/2000	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about software research at Microsoft based in part on a statistical technique developed by Thomas Bayes, an English mathematician and clergyman, misstated the century in which he worked. It was the 18th, not the 17th.
7/17/2000	Microsoft Sees Software 'Agent' as Way to Avoid Distractions	Attention, please. Hoping to shed its longstanding industry reputation as a mere imitator, not an innovator, Microsoft is spending heavily on research in a wide range of software technologies that include hand-held computing and voice recognition. But the most intriguing project may be taking place in the cramped office of Eric Horvitz, a devotee of an obscure, 17-century statistical technique that plays a key role in his current work.
7/13/2000	MICROSOFT BUYS NETGAMES USA TO ADD TO ITS GAMING SITE	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software maker, said yesterday that it had acquired NetGames USA Inc. to add to its Zone.com Internet games site. Terms were not disclosed. The closely held NetGames, based in Shawnee Mission, Kan., provides live reports of scores, rankings, statistics and other features that Microsoft plans to add to Zone.com and some retail games like MechWarrior4: Vengeance, set for release later this year.
7/11/2000	Satellite Venture Set to Report Big Commitments by Investors	ICO-Teledesic Global Ltd., the satellite telecommunications venture controlled by Craig O. McCaw, said it had received commitments for nearly $300 million from a number of influential investors, including William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. While Mr. Gates is the most famous name, Clayton, Dubilier is the more important catch for Mr. McCaw. The New York investment company is putting up more money -- $150 million to Mr. Gates's $100 million. And it will provide experienced management help in the form of George W. Tamke, a partner who is the former co-chief executive of Emerson Electric.
7/8/2000	China Moves To Cut Power Of Microsoft	Janet Reno is not the only one worried about Bill Gates's software monopoly. China's leaders are, too. They are concerned that the country is growing overly dependent on the Windows operating system, which controls computers running everything from banks to President Jiang Zemin's e-mail box. But the Chinese government, itself a master at monopoly, is taking its case against Microsoft not to the courtroom but to the marketplace, albeit with a bit of administrative fiat. It is backing the Linux operating system, which was created by a Finnish university student in 1991 and is distributed free to anyone.
7/8/2000	MICROSOFT ABANDONS JOINT CONTROL	After raising concern among regulators in Europe, the Microsoft Corporation changed its agreement to acquire 23.7 percent of Telewest Communications P.L.C. so that it would have no control over the management of Britain's second-largest cable television company. The European Union had objected to Microsoft's initial deal with Telewest because of the software company's possible dominance of television set-top box software in Britain. Andrew Ross Sorkin (NYT)
7/7/2000	Corrections	An article in some copies of Business Day on Saturday about the resignation of Raymond Lane, president of the Oracle Corporation, referred imprecisely to press reports that Oracle's software rival, Microsoft, had underwritten groups backing Microsoft's antitrust defense. The error was repeated on Sunday in the Economic View column in Money & Business, about the exchange of invective between Oracle and Microsoft. The accounts of Microsoft's financial support, in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, focused on two groups that are now known to have been targets of an Oracle-sponsored investigation. But none of the newspapers have said the documents cited in their coverage came from the Oracle operation; they have not identified the sources of their information.
7/6/2000	Windows Me, Microsoft's Latest, Is a Less Than Millennial Upgrade	THE first thing one needs to know about upgrading to the new Windows Millennium Edition operating system -- besides the fact that PC makers plan to offer it on new home computers this summer and that Microsoft will make it available as an upgrade for older computers in September -- is that the Uninstall routine is inside the Commands folder, which is tucked inside the Windows folder. Actually, the first thing one needs to know is that Windows Me is an interesting but hardly crucial upgrade for Windows 98, with a bunch of clever new features intended to make home computers easier and more fun to use. And if Windows Me is factory-installed on a new computer, it will almost certainly make the computer faster to boot up, more reliable, easier to connect to other computers and to the Internet and much more entertaining and versatile in the areas of music and video.
7/4/2000	Specialist in Appeals Cases Is Added to Microsoft Team	The Microsoft Corporation added more firepower to the defense team in its antitrust case yesterday by hiring Carter G. Phillips, one of the nation's leading appellate lawyers. Mr. Phillips, 47, a partner in the Washington office of Sidley & Austin, is one of the elite group of lawyers who regularly argue cases before the Supreme Court.
7/3/2000	Microsoft to Reward Its Technical Elite	In an effort to reward its brightest technologists, Microsoft plans to announce today that it has created a distinguished engineer program, initially honoring 16 of the company's best designers. Similar programs are already in place at Cisco Systems, I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and Xerox as a way to reward engineers and scientists who might otherwise leave research and development jobs for management positions with greater financial rewards.
7/2/2000	Antitrust Suit Born of Law, Not of Lobbying	IT is no secret that the rivalry between the software leaders, Microsoft and Oracle, is bitter. Still, the acknowledgement last week by Oracle that it financed a series of escapades intended to embarrass Microsoft provided some lively summer entertainment -- especially a Keystone Kops caper in which private investigators offered office cleaners $1,200 for the contents of a proMicrosoft trade group's wastebaskets. Yet in the cross-fire of invective that ensued, the two foes found some common ground in what is known as public choice theory, whose practitioners use economic principles to analyze government decision-making, especially the influence of special-interest groups.
7/1/2000	The No. 2 Executive at Oracle Resigns Abruptly	The Oracle Corporation, the world's second-largest software publisher, said tonight that Raymond Lane, its president and chief operating officer, had abruptly resigned. Mr. Lane, 53, had been at Oracle for eight years and had held the post of president since 1996. Though he was the second-ranking executive in one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies, he has always been overshadowed by Oracle's flamboyant chief executive and co-founder, Lawrence J. Ellison.
6/29/2000	PC's Under Surveillance	To the Editor: Before discussing the ethics involved in selling spy software applications, we should consider the software environment that allows programs to snoop, spy, start viruses and store hidden files on the owner's hard drive without his or her knowledge. What the article fails to mention is that Windows is the only operating system where the user is not provided with commands to identify all programs running on his or her PC and to stop them at will. It is also the only operating system that the user and owner of the PC is required to pay for when buying a new PC. CLARA SMITH Brewster, N.Y.
6/29/2000	Oracle Leader Calls Microsoft Spying 'Civic Duty'	In a raucous news conference on a sprawling Silicon Valley corporate campus affectionately called Larryland by its inhabitants, Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman and founder of the Oracle Corporation, today defended his company's yearlong spying operation against Microsoft as a ''civic duty'' similar to investigative reporting by the press. ''All we did was to try to take information that was hidden and bring it into the light,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''I don't think that's arrogance. That's a public service.''
6/29/2000	The Sound Of Sculpture	One of the more admirable qualities of the Experience Music Project, the $240 million rock 'n' roll museum conceived by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, is its commitment to local musicians and artists. This is evident not just in its memorabilia from artists like Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, Heart and the Sonics, but also in its centerpiece: a giant sound sculpture made up of 600 guitars strung along the branches of a metal tree rising more than 30 feet into the air. On closer examination, little metallic centipedes seem to be perched over the strings of several dozen of the instruments: these are self-playing, self-tuning guitars that have been invented for the project. Throughout the day, guitar picks on mechanical arms strike the strings as computer-controlled dampers press down on the frets, creating eerily beautiful music.
6/29/2000	Corrections	A picture caption in some copies yesterday with the continuation of a front-page article about an acknowledgment by the Oracle Corporation that it had hired a detective firm, Investigative Group International, to investigate groups sympathetic to the Microsoft Corporation misspelled the name of the chairman of the investigative firm. He is Terry Lenzner, not Lenzer.
6/28/2000	JAPANESE CABLE MERGER	The Jupiter Telecommunications Company and the Titus Communications Company, Japan's two largest cable television operators, said they planned to merge on Sept. 1, a move that will intensify the budding competition to supply Japanese consumers with high-speed Internet access. The merged company will have two major American shareholders: Liberty Media, a subsidiary of the AT&T Corporation, will own 35 percent, while the Microsoft Corporation will own 24 percent. Combined, the two companies will have 750,000 subscribers. Stephanie Strom (NYT)
6/28/2000	Oracle Hired a Detective Agency To Investigate Microsoft's Allies	The Oracle Corporation acknowledged today that it had hired a prominent Washington detective firm to investigate groups sympathetic to its archrival, the Microsoft Corporation, an effort that yielded documents embarrassing to Microsoft in the midst of its antitrust battle with the government. Oracle's admission today followed reports linking the detective firm, the Investigative Group International, to an unsuccessful attempt this month to obtain documents from a pro-Microsoft trade group, the Association for Competitive Technology, by offering payments to janitors at the group's Washington office.
6/27/2000	Double Duty for a Microsoft Investigator	When a Microsoft law firm needed help recently in tracking down pirates and counterfeiters of the company's software, it turned to a private investigative firm with a reputation for coming up with sensitive information for high-profile clients. So Microsoft was taken aback this month by reports that linked the firm, Investigative Group International, to mysterious efforts to obtain the trash of a pro-Microsoft trade association in Washington, presumably looking for documents that would embarrass the company as it fought a high-stakes antitrust case.
6/26/2000	Judge Lobs the Microsoft Case Into Another Court	The unexpected order last week to suspend restrictions on Microsoft's business practices until appeals of its antitrust case are complete held some good news for every party to the suit. But the true winner was the trial judge who made the decision, Thomas Penfield Jackson. For months Judge Jackson had been expressing discomfort at the fact that he alone was making all the judgments in this important case.
6/26/2000	Compressed Data; Very Deep Pockets Backing M.I.T. Project	After dinner was served to the elite group of computer scientists assembled at Boston's sumptuous Bay Tower Room last Tuesday night, Prof. Juhani Kuusi, chief of the Nokia Research Center in Finland, made a toast. ''We have taken on a great challenge,'' Professor Kuusi said in his lilting accent. ''Let's do it.''

6/23/2000	U.S. and Microsoft Agree on Schedule	Microsoft and the government agreed on an expedited schedule today for submitting briefs to the Supreme Court that will enable the court to decide whether to accept the antitrust case as soon as late August. On Tuesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson sent the case to the Supreme Court for direct review under a little-used law known as the Expediting Act.
6/23/2000	Microsoft Plans to Shift Product Focus To the Internet	Embracing an approach to computing it once scoffed at, Microsoft unveiled a strategy today that will increasingly move its business away from the personal computer the company has championed since the mid-1970's. The company said it would retool its product line to shift the very focus of computing away from hardware devices and toward a new generation of Internet-based software allowing people to interact with data and one another whether they are using computers, digital cell phones or interactive televisions.
6/21/2000	Digital Island Shares Soar on Streaming Media Venture	Shares of Digital Island Inc. soared 31 percent today after the company said that it was working with Compaq Computer, Intel and Microsoft to create a network for delivering real-time audio and video on the Internet. So-called streaming technology, made popular by Real Player from Real Networks, QuickTime from Apple Computer and Windows Media Player from Microsoft, allows the distribution of full-motion video over the Internet.
6/21/2000	Microsoft Wins Year's Reprieve From Penalties	The trial judge in the Microsoft antitrust case unexpectedly delayed today the sweeping restrictions he had imposed on the company's conduct until a higher court affirms them. The restrictions on Microsoft's business practices, ranging from the features of its software to its relations with customers and rivals, were to take effect in just 11 weeks. They were part of an order signed two weeks ago by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that also called for a breakup of the company.
6/20/2000	Appeals Court Plans Fast-Paced Schedule for Review of the Microsoft Case	A federal appeals court stepped forcefully into the Microsoft antitrust case today, dismissing a government argument that it lacked jurisdiction and setting a fast-paced schedule for reviewing Microsoft's request that the judges block a lower-court order restricting its conduct. Microsoft applauded the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying, ''Obviously, we are pleased that the appeals court unanimously sided with Microsoft and rejected the government's position.''
6/19/2000	Critic Sees Flaws in Microsoft's Strategy	As Microsoft prepares to announce its Next Generation Windows Services initiative this week, an influential computer scientist is circulating a thesis that challenges William H. Gates's vision of the future. On Thursday, Microsoft plans to describe its most radically new computing strategy since December 1995, when Mr. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, announced the ''embrace and extend'' strategy to expand the company's dominance of desktop computing to include the Internet.
6/18/2000	Marketplace Tampering	To the Editor: Joel I. Klein's June 13 Op-Ed article about Microsoft beautifully illustrates the principle that government intervention in the marketplace has unseen, unintended consequences. If the government in effect compels a new Microsoft applications company to cater to users of the Palm Pilot and Linux, other entrepreneurs may be discouraged from filling those market niches with new, perhaps better products.
6/17/2000	Microsoft Accuses Its Rivals Of Garbage-Can Tactics	Microsoft accused its rivals today of masterminding an attempt to buy trash generated by a Microsoft-backed lobbying organization, apparently hoping the trash would yield valuable information on the company. The accusation came as the Justice Department filed another brief in the antitrust case against the company. It sought to counter a Microsoft brief filed Thursday opposing the government's effort to send the company's appeal in the case directly to the Supreme Court.
6/16/2000	The Chairman's Vision	This is the third of a series of television commercials in which Microsoft's leaders describe the company's values and its importance to the economy. The first began shortly after a federal judge ruled in April that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. The current installment, titled ''Vision,'' began running Sunday, four days after the judge ordered that Microsoft should be split in two. Microsoft is appealing both the legal ruling and the breakup order. PRODUCER -- McCann-Erickson/A&L, part of McCann-Erickson Worldwide, which is a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
6/16/2000	Microsoft's Lobbyists	To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 9) says Microsoft should be broken up if for nothing else than it hired ''an army of Washington lobbyists to try to get Congress to cut the budget of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department while Microsoft had its case before that department.''
6/16/2000	Microsoft Urges Court to Start on Appeal	Continuing the battle of the briefs, Microsoft told the Court of Appeals today that the judges should ignore a government brief asking them not to begin work on the company's antitrust appeal until the Supreme Court decided whether to take it. The Justice Department, the 19 state attorneys general who are its partners, and the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, are all working to move Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme Court, under an obscure law known as the Expediting Act. But the company wants its case heard first by the Court of Appeals, which ruled in its favor in a previous case.
6/15/2000	The Next Big Antitrust Case	This week the Justice Department began its antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard. The government argues that the Visa and MasterCard networks are too cozy with each other and use their enormous financial power to knock out potential competitors, thereby stunting innovation. Some of the arguments mirror those that Justice made against Microsoft. Consumers should hope for the same outcome -- a resounding victory for Justice. Thousands of banks offer Visa and MasterCard credit cards. Many banks offer both. The trouble comes from the fact that some banks that serve on the governing board of one network do substantial business with the other. This ''dual governance,'' says Justice, discourages competition between the networks, stifling the desire to create new products. It is important to note what this case is not about. The individual banks set interest rates and frequent-flier and other benefits in order to compete for cardholders. Justice does not argue that the banks are conspiring to deny customers good deals. Instead, it makes two other antitrust accusations.
6/15/2000	Justice Dept. Asks Appeals Judges to Let Supreme Court Act First in Microsoft Case	The Justice Department filed a brief today with a federal appeals court intended to persuade the judges not to begin work on the Microsoft case until the Supreme Court decides whether to take it. The department and 19 state attorneys general, as well as the trial judge, want to move Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Microsoft, on the other hand, wants the appeal heard first by the lower court, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And in a lightning-fast legal maneuver Tuesday afternoon, the company filed a part of its appeal with that court, which eagerly accepted it.
6/15/2000	Corrections	A front-page article on Monday about Microsoft's lobbying and public relations efforts included a former member of Congress erroneously among lobbyists for Microsoft and misspelled his surname. The former representative is Bill Paxon, not Paxson, and he has never represented the company.
6/15/2000	Problems at Hotmail Service Leave Some Without E-Mail	Some users of Hotmail, the free Web-based e-mail service from Microsoft, have been unable to get access to their accounts since last week. A Microsoft spokeswoman, Jessica Dobberstein, said the problem had occurred during routine maintenance on a server. Ms. Dobberstein did not specify the exact number of people affected but said that fewer than 1 percent of the 67 million Hotmail subscribers had lost service. She said users seemed to have been affected randomly, regardless of where they live or the status of their accounts.
6/14/2000	Microsoft and the Law	To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 9) is right to champion the rule of law, the foundation of a liberal society and a market economy. In calling for retribution against Microsoft, however, he loses sight of an important point: The arbitrary punishment of individuals and companies for perceived ''arrogance'' is nothing less than an unconscionable violation of this hallowed principle.
6/14/2000	Microsoft's Arguments Seeking a Delay in the Court's Order	Following are excerpts from a motion filed yesterday by Microsoft for a stay of the judgment against it in a federal antitrust suit: Microsoft's stay motion has been pending for nearly a week, and the district court has ''failed to afford the relief requested'' by the motion. Accordingly, Microsoft now asks this court to stay the judgment pending appeal. Time is of the essence here. Many extreme provisions of the judgment start to take effect 90 days after its entry, and Microsoft must begin preparing immediately if it is to be in compliance with the judgment in 84 days. Microsoft therefore respectfully requests that the court set an expedited briefing schedule on Microsoft's motion so that it can be resolved as soon as possible. Microsoft will promptly advise the court if, contrary to all expectations, the district court grants Microsoft's stay motion now that a notice of appeal has been filed.
6/14/2000	SYKES SELLS EMPLOYEE BENEFITS UNIT IN RESTRUCTURING	Sykes Enterprises, which runs customer-support centers for Microsoft and other companies, is selling its employee-benefits unit for $165.5 million in cash to a closely held investment company. Sykes also said its second-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' forecasts. The company said it was selling its SHPS unit to Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe as part of a reorganization that will include some office closings and the firing of an unspecified number of workers. Sykes said it expected a gain of $68.7 million, or $1.60 a share, from the sale. Shares of Sykes fell $3.75 each, to $16.625.
6/14/2000	MICROSOFT CLAIMS ANTITRUST JUDGE MADE MANY ERRORS	Microsoft took an important step today in its effort to overturn the antitrust ruling against it, telling an appellate court that the trial judge had committed ''an array of serious substantive and procedural errors that infected virtually every aspect of the proceedings.'' It added that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order last week to break up the company was based largely on ''hearsay declarations submitted by the plaintiffs.'' And it asserted that restrictions imposed by the judge, unless stayed immediately, would have ''far-reaching and irreversible consequences.'' [Excerpts, Page C8.]
6/14/2000	Company Adds to Cable TV Holdings	Microsoft agreed on Monday to exercise warrants to buy about $53.2 million worth of stock in United Pan-Europe Communications, increasing its stake in Europe's second-largest cable television company to 8 percent. Microsoft is buying 5.7 million shares at about $9.33 each, adding 1 percentage point to its previous stake of 7 percent. The warrants, which became exercisable in February, were issued as part of a technology agreement between the companies.
6/13/2000	Hidden Costs of Stock Options May Soon Come Back to Haunt	Microsoft and Cisco Systems, two of the nation's most profitable companies, are well on their way to owing nothing in federal income taxes on the money they have made so far this year. How can powerful companies like these, reporting billions in income to shareholders, owe nothing in taxes? It is all thanks to the wonder of employee stock options.
6/13/2000	Government Opposes Microsoft's Request for a Stay	The Justice Department rebuked Microsoft in a court filing today, saying the company's request for a stay of the trial judge's ruling against it last week was actually a disingenuous attempt ''to manipulate the court'' and thwart taking the antitrust case directly to the Supreme Court. A law known as the Expediting Act allows antitrust cases ''of general public importance'' to be sent directly to the Supreme Court for review, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson says he favors such a step. Last week senior Justice Department officials said they intended to invoke the Expediting Act.
6/13/2000	The Enduring Stranglehold	Critics of the government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft said that the company was already at risk from rapid changes in technology. But this criticism is misguided. In reality, emerging high-tech offerings make last week's court remedy in the Microsoft case all the more important. During the last decade, when the use of personal computers exploded and the Internet revolutionized computing, Microsoft's dominance of the P.C. operating systems market remained unchanged; Windows' market share climbed from 93 percent at the start of the decade to about 95 percent today. Indeed, the more high technology has changed, the more striking it is that Windows' monopoly market position has stayed the same.
6/13/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Rapid Growth Makes Cisco A New Leader	At any moment, one company stands in the spotlight of the middle ring in the stock market's never-ending circus. It may not be the biggest corporation in the world, or the most profitable, but somehow it both mirrors and leads the market's broader action. For most of the 1990's, as personal computers moved from expensive toy to ubiquitous tool, Microsoft was that company. But with the Internet now more important than the PC, and Microsoft caught in a brutal antitrust fight, the software giant has lost its leadership to Cisco Systems, the San Jose, Calif., company that makes much of the equipment that powers the Internet.
6/11/2000	At AT&T, Memories Of a Similar Air of Denial	COMPARISONS can be overdrawn between the proposed breakup of Microsoft and the dismemberment almost 20 years ago of AT&T. But veterans of the Bell System's split see at least one clear parallel: the sense of denial within AT&T was as strong then as it appears to be at Microsoft now. Harold W. Burlingame, an AT&T employee since 1962 and now executive vice president of AT&T Wireless, was part of the phone company's breakup team in the early 1980's. Burke Stinson, who joined AT&T in 1969 and is now a manager in its public relations department, was in a lower-level public relations job at the time.
6/11/2000	The Nation: 800-Pound Gorillas; Oligopoly	A nice irony of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision last week is that he rejected the suggestion of smashing the world's most powerful software company into a bunch of ''Baby Bills,'' and instead proposed to split Microsoft into two behemoths that would dominate their respective markets. In fact, a major legacy of the Clinton administration will be that it encouraged one of the greatest periods of industrial concentration in American history, affecting old and new sectors ranging from oil and pharmaceuticals, to telecommunications, broadcasting and the Internet. Call it the Age of Oligopoly.
6/11/2000	Creative Renewal at Delphi	WHEN Debbie Bittner learned that her employer, General Motors, planned to spin off its automotive parts division as Delphi Automotive Systems last year, she faced leaving the only company she had ever known. Her first job out of high school had been at a G.M. steering-column plant in Saginaw, Mich., and for more than 21 years she held nine jobs in six different parts of the company, from finance to operations to customer care. G.M. was family. Her father, Fred Keyes, recently retired after 38 years as a skilled tradesman. Her grandfather had been a foundry worker. Yet as proud as she is of her G.M. roots, she finds herself defending her allegiance to Delphi, to which she was assigned on Jan. 1, 1999. ''My father said, 'Maybe you should see if you can stay with G.M.,' '' she said, recalling a recent conversation with him and her brother, Mark Keyes, who also works at Delphi. ''We said, 'No, we think this is a good thing.' ''
6/11/2000	U.S. vs. MICROSOFT: Microsoft at the Razor's Edge; On the Inside: Soldiering On Toward Victory	AFTER a long and bitter court fight, a federal judge last week ordered Microsoft broken in two. From William H. Gates, the chairman, on down, Microsoft is confident that it will win on appeal and keep its operating system and applications businesses intact. But in the meantime, Mr. Gates's close friend Steven A. Ballmer, who became chief executive earlier this year, must manage the company through a minefield of challenges: a resurgent software industry, increasingly obstacles in recruiting and the creation of a new business offering software and services over the Internet.
6/11/2000	The Last Refuge	On Wednesday Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered a breakup of Microsoft along the lines proposed by the Justice Department. In so doing he in effect dismissed concerns about the economic impact of such a breakup, and accepted the claim by Justice that splitting up Microsoft would accelerate innovation. On the same day, technology guru Nicholas Negroponte, speaking in London, bitterly attacked Britain's recent auction of licenses for next-generation mobile telecommunications. Although selling the licenses to the highest bidders has enriched Her Majesty's Treasury by $35 billion, he argued that they should instead have been given to firms that would do best in ''stimulating innovation, stimulating the economy, stimulating the whole telecommunications process.'' And last week the French decided not to emulate Britain's auction, instead allocating licenses in a ''beauty contest'' (their phrase!) based on ''merit.''
6/11/2000	U.S. vs. MICROSOFT: Microsoft at the Razor's Edge; From Experts, Advice on an Amicable Split	IMAGINE Microsoft's top officials sitting down with an agitated William H. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, their fuming chief executive, moments after the headlines reporting the unthinkable start crossing computer screens at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters: ''Last Appeal Turned Down.'' They never believed it would come to this when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled so long ago that the company had violated antitrust laws and should be split in two. They still feel, as the company's lawyers had argued at the time of the trial, that breaking the company up is not only unjustified but also a ''hopelessly complex'' assignment. They fear that skilled employees, Microsoft's main asset in the fast-evolving software business, will abandon the company in droves.
6/11/2000	Can Owners Discount Microsoft Uncertainty?	Micro. Soft. That is what the government wants. And Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson agreed. But Microsoft wants to remain one word, not two.
6/10/2000	The Colossus of Redmond Suddenly Seems Human	Whether Microsoft wins or loses its appeal of the antitrust ruling that could break the company in two, its world has changed, perhaps forever. Some of the changes are linked to a growing belief that close government scrutiny has made it more difficult for Microsoft, based in nearby Redmond, Wash., to flex its industry muscle. Others are linked to the rapid emergence of new consumer markets, ranging from hand-held computing to digital delivery of audio and video, where the industry standards established by Microsoft software and Intel hardware may offer no advantage.
6/10/2000	Innovation Isn't The Microsoft Way	Bill Gates, protesting the government's antitrust initiatives against Microsoft, has asserted from the first that limiting the scope of his company's activities or breaking it up would stifle the innovation that helped Microsoft catalyze the information revolution into existence. The incongruity of this response to the Justice Department's pleadings and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision is inescapable: Microsoft soared to its powerful heights on the backs of innovations that were largely the work of others. Microsoft's market exploitation of the DOS operating system that Mr. Gates acquired from the tiny Seattle Computer Products is well documented. He paid Seattle Computer $75,000 for exclusive rights to the system and was then able to extract billions from I.B.M. and its imitators in license fees. Microsoft later paid $925,000 to settle a lawsuit by Seattle Computer.
6/9/2000	Experts Praise Judge's Rulings On Microsoft	Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks yesterday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition. They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
6/9/2000	Experts Praise Judge's Rulings On Microsoft	Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks yesterday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition. They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
6/9/2000	Some Kind of Remedy	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision to throw the book at Microsoft was not unexpected: his formal ''findings of law'' issued earlier made very clear that he viewed the company's alleged transgressions in the harshest light. Nonetheless, it was still a jolt to see the decision -- dividing Microsoft into an operating systems company and an applications company -- written in black and white. Breaking up an enterprise that was not itself the product of a merger is unprecedented in antitrust law. And ordering the dissolution of the flagship firm of the software industry without hearings on the implications approaches the bizarre.
6/9/2000	A Muted Reaction of Admiration and Disbelief	Windows and Word may be ubiquitous across Europe and Asia, but news of the court order to break up Microsoft generated a muted reaction outside of the United States today. There was a sense of admiration -- mixed with disbelief -- among many commentators that a government would take such a step. Neither Europe nor Japan have ever seen a comparable effort to break up a large company, though European regulators have become much more aggressive about imposing big fines on companies for anticompetitive activities.
6/9/2000	Microsoft Breakup: A Serious Mistake	To the Editor: Re ''Microsoft Breakup Is Ordered for Antitrust Violations'' (front page, June 8): The proceedings against the Microsoft Corporation have left me with one nagging question: What operating system do Justice Department lawyers use on their computers?
6/9/2000	Foreign Affairs; The Young And the Clueless	Wednesday's Microsoft ruling was about a lot of technical matters -- Internet browsers, market share, the Sherman Antitrust Act. But if you read carefully Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling to split up Microsoft, you will see that this case is also about attitude. In my view, it's an indictment of the attitude of the high-tech community in general toward government, but it's certainly an indictment of the particular attitude and arrogance of Microsoft. Bless Judge Jackson's heart for that. For many in Silicon Valley, government is irrelevant at best and obstructionist at worst. For many in the high-tech community, the world runs on electrons and stock options, and government is basically an institution of tax-seeking bloodsuckers. The idea that none of Silicon Valley's innovations would ever have flowered without the rule of law maintained by Washington or without the global stability maintained by the U.S. military -- funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars -- is really a foreign notion to many in the dot-com world. Tell techies that without America on duty there would be no America Online and they will look at you as if you were speaking Latin (or Fortran).
6/9/2000	U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: Pursuing a Giant; Retracing the Missteps In the Microsoft Defense	The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is certainly no judicial radical. A former Naval officer, he was an active Republican when Ronald Reagan appointed him to the federal bench in 1982. His record before the Microsoft case suggested, if anything, that he was pro-business. In 1987, the federal government sued General Motors, contending that its cars had dangerous brake defects. Judge Jackson sided with the car company, dismissing the government's evidence as merely ''anecdotal accounts of skidding events.''
6/9/2000	Microsoft Breakup: A Serious Mistake	To the Editor: Re ''Microsoft Breakup Is Ordered for Antitrust Violations'' (front page, June 8): Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has ordered Microsoft to be split into two separate companies. Unless Microsoft wins on appeal, this ruling will cripple a major segment of the American economy, and possibly damage many retirement funds.
6/9/2000	Company Quickly Seeks A Stay of Judge's Order	Wasting no time, Microsoft filed a court plea overnight, asking for an immediate stay of the ruling a federal judge entered against the company on Wednesday afternoon. The company offered expansive reasoning for the request, saying the judgment would ''inflict grievous and irreparable harm on Microsoft, its 35,000 employees, its millions of shareholders, its thousands of business partners and tens of millions of consumers around the world who rely on Microsoft's products.''
6/9/2000	Microsoft Breakup: A Serious Mistake	To the Editor: Re ''Stern Justice for Microsoft'' (editorial, June 8): Microsoft is one business, with lots of people sitting in rooms writing software, and writing consistently with all the others down the hall, not a group of disparate operations.
6/8/2000	The Government Breakup Plan: How It Will Work	The centerpiece of the government's cure for the predatory, monopolistic, take-no-prisoners behavior that Microsoft was found to have embraced is to chop the company in two. One new company would make the Windows operating system, the other would make the applications that are run by the operating system, as well as Microsoft's Internet and computer hardware businesses. The government called the companies ''Ops Co.'' and ''Apps Co.'' in court papers.
6/8/2000	After a Rout, Still Fighting	With his final order yesterday in the Microsoft antitrust case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said yes to the government one more time. He has agreed with the government, almost without qualification, on the facts of the case, on the law and now on the harsh remedy of splitting the company in two. In Judge Jackson's Federal District Court, the result has been not just a defeat for Microsoft but a rout, not a closely fought legal contest but a judicial ratification of the government's case.
6/8/2000	Most PC Users Are Unlikely to Abandon Company's Products Despite Ruling	The effect on consumers of yesterday's decision to split the Microsoft Corporation into two companies remains unclear, in large part because Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's orders are on hold until the appeals process is concluded, which could take years. But other factors are contributing to the uncertainty, including the profound shift to the Internet as the driving force of personal computers and the emergence of Internet-based consumer appliances and wireless devices that are independent of Microsoft's monopoly on desktop PC's.
6/8/2000	Stern Justice for Microsoft	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to split Microsoft into two independent companies -- one selling Windows, the other selling applications like Word and Excel -- is the proper remedy for repeated violations of the antitrust laws. A less drastic remedy would prove ineffectual or horribly intrusive. Judge Jackson chose breakup because the two companies would then compete and innovate without having government officials overseeing every move. Breakup is the best way to create a market where Microsoft can no longer smother software that would be good for consumers but bad for Microsoft. After two years of deliberation, Judge Jackson ruled in April that Microsoft had abused its monopoly over Windows, the operating system that runs nearly all personal computers, to crush competition. It adopted business practices that would have been unprofitable but for their role in blocking rivals from getting fair access to customers. Specifically, for example, it used illegal tactics to prevent Netscape from freely selling its browser.
6/8/2000	Gates's Statement: The First Day of the Rest of the Case	Following is a transcript of the opening statement by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, at a news conference yesterday in Redmond, Wash., as recorded by The New York Times: I'm reminded of the old saying that today is the first day of the rest of your life. I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the rest of this case.
6/8/2000	The Text of the Order To Split Up Microsoft	Following is the order by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson directing that Microsoft be broken up: These cases are before the court for disposition of the sole matter presently remaining for decision by the trial court, namely, entry of appropriate relief for the violations of the Sherman Act, Sections 1 and 2, and various state laws committed by the defendant Microsoft Corporation as found by court in accordance with its findings of fact and conclusions of law. Final judgment will be entered contemporaneously herewith. No further proceedings will be required.
6/8/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Microsoft in the Court of the Investor	Microsoft is more than a company that dominates a rapidly growing industry. To investors it has been a stock whose owners believed in it with almost religious conviction. Its declines were usually mild and always brief. But that faith has been shaken in the last couple of months, and now investors face the question of how well Microsoft can perform after its conduct has been ruled to be illegal and a breakup of the company ordered.
6/8/2000	Some experts of spin offer advice to Microsoft on how to reach consumers' hearts and minds.	AS the Microsoft Corporation assesses the implications of the breakup ordered yesterday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the advice from professional communicators on how the company ought to handle the consequences is being offered almost as quickly as the ''I Love You'' computer worm infested e-mail in-boxes. Microsoft ''should turn it into a political issue and go right over the heads of the politicians and appeal to their bosses: the taxpayers, the voters,'' said Richard Laermer, chief executive at RLM Public Relations in New York, which represents several technology companies.
6/8/2000	Muted Comments Avoid Criticizing the Defendant	Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive presidential nominees, declined to comment today on the court order to break Microsoft into two companies, but Congressional Republicans condemned the ruling. Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, who in February had expressed concerns that a breakup would threaten economic growth, said tonight that ''Governor Bush has said all along that it would not be appropriate for him to discuss the specifics of the case while it is still before the courts and Microsoft has indicated that they intend to appeal.''
6/8/2000	Gates Says the Court Fight Has Just Begun	From the perspective of the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest software company, the fat lady hasn't sung. Arguing that his legal battle with the federal government is far from over, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief software architect, said today that he was looking forward to the next round of the antitrust trial, which will soon move to a higher court.
6/8/2000	In Silicon Valley, Ruling Won't Change Culture	Even if Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to break up Microsoft survives appeal unscathed, potential competitors will not feel the impact of the antitrust trial for at least a year, industry executives said today. In part, they say, the culture in the software industry will take time to change. For example, they said it might take a year or more before investors like venture capitalists begin to finance potential competitors to Microsoft.
6/8/2000	MICROSOFT BREAKUP IS ORDERED FOR ANTITRUST LAW VIOLATIONS	A federal judge ordered the breakup of the Microsoft Corporation today, saying the severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ''has proved untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to have accepted his ruling that it had broadly violated the nation's antitrust laws. ''There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has already done'' to dominate operating systems and Internet software, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his final ruling in the long-running trial.

6/8/2000	If Microsoft Is Sawed in Half	''Possession of unchallenged economic power deadens initiative, discourages thrift and depresses energy.'' ''Immunity from competition is a narcotic, and rivalry a stimulant, to industrial progress.''
6/8/2000	The World of Microsoft	To the Editor: Gamers got a foretaste of the world of Microsoft several years ago. The Internet Gaming Zone was just as David Kushner described it (''Stop Chatting and Deal, Grandpa,'' June 1): a place for people to play games like hearts, spades and chess, while maintaining an ongoing conversation at the bottom of the screen. It allowed me, for example, to play chess with my son, even though I was in New York City and he was at Indiana University. We played in real time with real-time chat. It also let me relax with cyberfriends.
6/7/2000	INTERNET STRATEGIC ALLIANCE	The British telecommunications company Cable and Wireless P.L.C. entered a strategic alliance with the Microsoft Corporation to offer corporate customers business software applications and other services over the Internet. The alliance will also include the Compaq Computer Corporation, which will help develop products that will work on desktop computers and wireless hand-held devices. Andrew Ross Sorkin
6/7/2000	Microsoft Files Final Criticism of Government Breakup Plan	In a spirited final filing, Microsoft yesterday condemned the government's plan to split the company in two as ''a radical step'' that seemed to treat software as if it were pornography. Microsoft's brief denounced the government's breakup plan as ''completely obscure'' for failing to clearly define Internet software.
6/7/2000	The Next Big Leap? It's Called XML	IN the beginning, as it were, the Web was made possible by a simple innovation known as Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. Through this language, which arranged text, images and buttons in a World Wide Web browser, information could -- and very much still can -- be read by computer users all over the world. Yet despite its power, HTML has flaws, the most obvious being an inability to make distinctions between the presentation of computer data and the data itself. HTML, in other words, deals only with the ''appearance'' of information. This is why the Web is sometimes called a ''fancy fax machine'' -- great at doling out documents on request but poorly designed for direct information exchanges between computers on the Net. Now, inevitably, the next generation of Web language, called XML (for Extensible Markup Language), is emerging, and many software designers can barely contain their excitement over its potential to establish a real Internet lingua franca.
6/6/2000	Justice Dept. Rejects Big Changes in Its Breakup Plan for Microsoft	Responding in detail to Microsoft's criticisms, the Justice Department today rejected any substantive changes in its plan to break up the company. Most of the company's proposed revisions ''would undermine or frustrate the purpose and effectiveness'' of the remedy proposal, the government said in a brief filed with the judge in the long-running antitrust trial.
6/4/2000	Microsoft Will Test Justices' Prowess	WHEN the Supreme Court confronted its first Internet case three years ago, the justices received special training from their library staff. The lessons ''helped assure each of us that we knew how to use the Net and understood the technical matters at issue,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer recalled a few weeks ago at a symposium on biomedical research in Cambridge, Mass. Thus empowered, the court went on in that case, Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, to produce a unanimous decision that struck down the Communications Decency Act on First Amendment grounds and established the primacy of free speech principles in cyberspace.
6/2/2000	Final Ruling in Microsoft Antitrust Case Is Unexpectedly Delayed for About a Week	The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case unexpectedly agreed to delay his final ruling for about a week today, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal to water down the government's breakup plan. The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had planned to issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of the company, today or Friday. But Justice Department officials called him this morning to ask if they could reply to Microsoft's comments on the government's remedy proposal; the comments were filed with the court on Wednesday.
6/1/2000	Microsoft Files Sharp Critique Of a Breakup	Ignoring the judge's assertion that he wanted no more briefs, Microsoft filed a detailed criticism of the government's breakup plan today, the last filing for the record before the judge rules on how to deal with the company's antitrust violations. The company's proposal significantly modifies nearly every element of the government's remedy plan, lengthening the amount of time the company would have to comply with the order and scaling back many proposals.
5/30/2000	Gateway and AOL Bypass Industry Stalwarts on Components	Breaking ranks with the powerful ''Wintel duopoly,'' based on Intel hardware and Microsoft software, Gateway and America Online plan to announce on Tuesday that they will use a processor from an upstart Silicon Valley chip maker and a version of the Linux operating system in a new Internet home appliance scheduled to go on sale later this year. The decision is a big victory for the Transmeta Corporation, a chip design company in Santa Clara, Calif., that has developed a microprocessor intended to be a low-power and inexpensive alternative to Intel's microprocessors.
5/29/2000	The Challenge For Microsoft Is in Middleware	The government's antitrust suit against Microsoft has provided plenty of surprises the last two years. But surely one of its most remarkable byproducts is that a nerdish bit of computer plumbing called middleware has emerged as the star of the case and a focus of public-policy debate in the Internet age. In his legal ruling last month, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had no doubts about what so frightened Microsoft that it repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. ''Middleware,'' he wrote, ''threatened to demolish Microsoft's coveted monopoly power.''
5/28/2000	Unplugged, and Smug	Sir Richard Branson, the self-described ''technophobe'' whose fortune derives from music and airline ventures under the Virgin brand, looked quite at home briefing reporters last week during a break in Microsoft's closed-door gathering for chief executives.
5/28/2000	Ideas & Trends: Antitrust Annals; The Uncertain Art Of Legal Remedies	IN a court filing last week Microsoft called the government's proposal to break the company in two ''the antitrust equivalent of the death penalty.'' Lawyerly hyperbole, it seems, but in the old days -- the very old days -- antitrust offenders couldn't afford to take any chances. In 388-386 B.C., a group of Athenian grain dealers formed a corn monopoly and manipulated prices, according to research by Spencer Weber Waller, a professor at the Brooklyn Law School. The dealers were caught, prosecuted and put to death.
5/27/2000	U.S. Assails Microsoft and Resubmits Proposal for a Breakup	The Justice Department denounced the Microsoft Corporation today, accusing the company of cynical, irresponsible behavior on the last day of its antitrust trial. The department also filed a modified version of its proposal to break up the company that includes a handful of small, technical changes that the judge had requested. Microsoft plans to file a response to the form, but not the substance, of the revised proposal on Wednesday. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's final ruling in the long-running antitrust case will most likely come a day or two after that.
5/25/2000	Microsoft Ignores Woes As It Looks to Future	While Microsoft's lawyers pleaded with a federal judge not to break up the company, William H. Gates and other senior company executives were painting a rosy picture of a software-enhanced future today for chief executives of some of the world's largest companies. The focus of the annual event on Microsoft's campus here was the Internet's impact on business and, to a lesser extent, consumers. In the limited portion of the gathering open to the media, the courtroom battle over Microsoft's survival was not even mentioned.
5/25/2000	Judge Suggests U.S. Remedy For Microsoft Is Inadequate	The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case raised serious questions today about the government's plan to break up the company, seeming to suggest that he did not think the plan went far enough. The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, praised a brief submitted by a group of computer industry executives -- including many of Microsoft's rivals -- that called for breaking the company into three parts instead of two, as the government has proposed. He called it ''an excellent brief, excellent brief.''
5/23/2000	Microsoft Unexpectedly Files Another Brief	Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge today that quoted from a five-year-old government legal document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be ''against the public interest'' and ''dangerous to the economy's welfare.'' The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company. The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the case.
5/23/2000	4 Giants Set to Embrace Electronic Publishing	In signs of an intensifying digital rush in the American book industry, three trade publishing giants and Microsoft are poised to plunge deeper into the emerging electronic literary market. Time Warner Trade Publishing, a unit of Time Warner, is expected to announce today the creation of a separate online publishing venture called iPublish.com and iWrite, an unconventional hybrid that will solicit manuscripts from would-be authors for review for electronic publication.
5/18/2000	The Microsoft Issue	To the Editor: As Peter H. Lewis clearly points out in ''Would a Breakup Matter'' (State of the Art, May 4), a browser can be written for any operating system, making the proposed breakup of Microsoft pointless. But that is not the issue.
5/18/2000	Response by U.S. Faults Microsoft Alternative to Breakup Plan	Defending its plan to break up the Microsoft Corporation, the government filed documents with a federal judge tonight that disparaged Microsoft's alternative proposal as ''a cosmetic remedy that would have virtually no competitive significance.'' The brief, from the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general, is the last written filing in the case before penalty hearings begin on Wednesday. It is a response to the brief Microsoft filed last week, in which the company proposed several narrow restrictions on its conduct that it said would be more appropriate penalties than breaking up the company.
5/16/2000	Microsoft Revises Program To Protect E-Mail Users	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had developed a software update for its Outlook e-mail program that would reduce the vulnerability to rogue computer programs like ''I Love You'' and ''Melissa.'' The update will be available free from Microsoft's Office Update Web site (http://officeupdate.microsoft. com) next week.
5/15/2000	Divided against each other; united against the government.	ABOUT a year ago, Joel Klein, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division and perhaps Bill Gates's least favorite lawyer, was moving into his new home in Washington. He called for cable service and was told that the cable guy could come between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday. Could they be more specific, Mr. Klein asked.
5/15/2000	Microsoft Cites AT&T to Fight Breakup	Comparing the proposed breakup of Microsoft to the AT&T case of the 1980's, Brad Smith, a Microsoft lawyer, said he saw one big difference. ''AT&T was mostly a national company,'' he said, ''but Microsoft is operating in a global marketplace. If we are replaced as the technology leader, there's no guarantee that our successor will be from this country.''
5/13/2000	Seeing Two Microsofts, Not One	To the Editor: Richard Gilbert (Op-Ed, May 10) contrasts the government regulation of the heirs to AT&T's businesses with the prospect of a clean division of Microsoft into two virtually unregulated companies. In fact, the government's plan would create a mare's nest of rules -- everything from a requirement that the new Microsoft operating system company continue to sell obsolete versions of Windows at a fixed price, to a remarkable provision obliging the new company to discount ''light'' versions of Windows in proportion to the amount of code the computer maker chooses to rip out. Meanwhile, government functionaries would be called upon to decide imponderables like whether additions to Windows were ''middle-ware'' and thus must come with an easy means of removal.
5/13/2000	Seeing Two Microsofts, Not One	To the Editor: Re ''Microsoft Offers Alternative Plan in Antitrust Case'' (front page, May 11): Microsoft has been quick to promote its value not only to consumers but also to the economy as it seeks to quell the government's demand that the company be broken up. Are its executives so naive as to believe that we consumers are not aware that it is the ubiquity and interoperability of Microsoft's operating systems and software that make viruses like the ''I Love You'' virus not only easy but also inviting to write?
5/11/2000	Microsoft, Responding, Offers Stark View of the Future	The legal protest that Microsoft filed yesterday in reply to the government's plan to break up the company is an essay of grim futurism. Microsoft calls the government plan a ''draconian'' and ''speculative'' proposal that would bring ''uncertainty and chaos.'' Employees, the company says, would leave in droves. Its business would be destroyed, and the industry and consumers would ''suffer enormous harm.''
5/11/2000	MICROSOFT OFFERS ALTERNATIVE PLAN IN ANTITRUST CASE	While continuing to reject the antitrust findings against it, the Microsoft Corporation today offered a series of narrow restrictions on its behavior that it said would be more appropriate remedies than breaking up the company. Microsoft also asked the judge to throw out the government's breakup proposal immediately, arguing that ''the laws and the facts do not support such a radical step.''
5/11/2000	The Microsoft Matter	To the Editor: As mentioned in ''Would a Breakup Matter?'' (State of the Art, May 4), about the proposal for breaking up Microsoft, the petulant Justice Department failed to post its proposed remedy for Microsoft in the most popular word processing format, Microsoft Word. But it works just fine if you open in Word 2000 either the HTML or the WordPerfect 5.1 versions that were posted by the government. MIKE KELLY Redmond, Wash.
5/11/2000	The Microsoft Matter	To the Editor: Consumers and many computer companies have benefited from the Microsoft standard. The progress in personal computer technology was made because of the existence of such standards. Microsoft has made a much larger contribution to the uniformity of personal computing than I.B.M. did in the mainframe field. MICHAEL N. BERGELSON Bronx
5/11/2000	Excerpts From Microsoft's Response to Plan to Break Up Company	Following are excerpts from documents filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Washington by the Microsoft Corporation in response to last month's proposal by the government to split the company in two: MICROSOFT'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY REJECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BREAKUP PROPOSAL

5/10/2000	What is a dot-com brand name worth? A new survey has some not-too-surprising answers.	MUCH has been made of the need for dot-coms to generate awareness of their names among computer users. Internet companies are spending billions of dollars online, in print and on television to establish their brands. Now comes a study that tries to identify the winners and losers in the big branding struggle. The study, which was conducted in October and released in mid-April by Greenfield Online, an Internet market research company based in Wilton, Conn., surveyed about 3,400 computer users. Among 100 Internet names placed before the respondents, Microsoft.com has the highest ''brand power,'' defined as a combination of rankings in three categories: brand familiarity, the brand's ability to affect the Internet landscape and the brand's perceived financial strength.
5/10/2000	Microsoft Invests in Digital Video Developer	The Microsoft Corporation will invest about $18 million in SeaChange International Inc., and the companies will jointly develop technology to let video and audio be programmed once to run on both televisions and personal computers, the companies said today. Microsoft will work with SeaChange to design and build computer servers that allow video content to be exchanged from a TV to a PC. Currently, content must run through separate computer servers to be viewed on both televisions and computers.
5/10/2000	Official Defends Call for Breakup of Microsoft	Responding to Microsoft's public criticisms of the plan to break it in two, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division said today that the actual result would be ''exciting new products, with more choices and lower prices for consumers.'' The official, Joel I. Klein, added that Microsoft's key argument ''is wrong as a matter of fact, and wrong as a matter of history as well.'' He was speaking at a forum on the new economy at the University of California at Berkeley.
5/8/2000	The Innovator's Dilemma, and Microsoft's	William H. Gates complains that everyone at Microsoft pitching a new project seems to invoke the notion of the innovator's dilemma. The term, Mr. Gates told Forbes magazine last year, is ''a required slide in every funding presentation.'' Still, Mr. Gates might do well to pay attention, says Clayton M. Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who coined the phrase. His book, ''The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail,'' has been causing a stir at technology companies since it was published in 1997. It describes how leading companies are ambushed by new products.
5/8/2000	Microsoft Preparing Reply to Justice Dept.'s Breakup Proposal	Now it is Microsoft's turn to say what its future should be. On Wednesday, the company must submit its reply to the government's proposal to split the company in two and, at the prodding of a federal judge, offer its own suggested remedies in the antitrust case. Microsoft will not say precisely what its remedy recommendations will be. But they are expected to consist mainly of a reiteration of proposals Microsoft has made repeatedly during on-again, off-again settlement talks with the government over the last two years. The Microsoft concessions, according to people close to the talks, have covered opening up the company's pricing, contracts and the sharing of technical information with industry partners and rivals.
5/7/2000	Corrections	The Market Watch column last Sunday, about Microsoft's purchases of its own shares, misstated the month when the company can resume the buybacks, if it chooses, under the accounting treatment of an acquisition it completed in January. The month is July, not June.
5/6/2000	The E-Mail Virus Is Telling Us Things	To the Editor: Re ''A Disruptive Virus Invades Computers Around the World'' (front page, May 5): The latest virus invasion, particularly through the Microsoft Outlook program, illustrates yet another aspect of the problems of monopoly. In effect, the Windows monopoly is a computer monoculture with all the same problems of other monocultures.
5/3/2000	Across the Atlantic, the Microsoft Case Attracts Curiosity	This university town has been transformed in the last decade by the arrival of companies like Microsoft, along with a bevy of start-ups hoping to follow in its footsteps. Now it is watching intently to see whether Microsoft's path will be divided. ''For us, Microsoft is viewed as the archetypical high-tech success story,'' said John Cornish, director of product marketing for ARM Holdings, a designer of microchips for hand-held devices based in Cambridge that itself has become a hometown success story. ''The antitrust issues are a function of antitrust laws based on U.S. history, which differs very much from the U.K. and Europe.''
5/2/2000	2 Microsofts: The Right Thing?	To the Editor: The case against Microsoft has done more damage to the American consumer than all our attorneys general can ever hope to remedy (front page, April 29). Those would-be trust-busters have forgotten that when Standard Oil was broken up, the average American was not a stockholder. Today, millions of us own Microsoft either directly or through retirement plans.
5/2/2000	2 Microsofts: The Right Thing?	To the Editor: Re ''The Remedy for Microsoft'' (editorial, April 28): You applaud the spectacle of government lawyers using laws developed over the last 100 years to throttle this country's leading high-technology company. It's hard to imagine a greater farce.
5/2/2000	2 Microsofts: The Right Thing?	To the Editor: Paul Krugman (column, April 26) argues that to permit multiple companies to sell Windows would amount to an expropriation of intellectual property rights and would thus set a dangerous precedent. In fact, there is ample precedent for such ''expropriation.''
5/2/2000	2 Microsofts: The Right Thing?	To the Editor: Re ''U.S. and 17 States Ask Judge to Cut Microsoft in 2 Parts; Serious Curbs Also Sought'' (front page, April 29): The obvious solution to dissolving Microsoft's dominance of the software market would be for the government to mandate entry of the Windows operating system code into the public domain, where it truly belongs. Microsoft has profited immensely and for an extended period of time from this product and its market dominance.
5/2/2000	2 Microsofts: The Right Thing?	To the Editor: Paul Krugman (column, April 26) worries that splitting Microsoft into an operating system company and an applications company may be counterproductive, but a separate Microsoft applications company would have an incentive to produce versions of its popular applications programs for other operating systems like Linux or else cede that market to competitors. It would no longer be able to use its special position vis-a-vis Microsoft Windows to avoid that competition.
5/2/2000	Microsoft Unveils Some Tactics It Will Use to Fight Breakup Plan	Fighting to defeat the government's proposal to break the company in two, Microsoft plans to ask the trial judge next week for broad authority to obtain hundreds of pages of government records on the case, and for permission to summon witnesses to argue that the proposal is unwarranted and out of bounds. ''Their extreme request for relief invites questions on how they came to the observations and conclusions in their declaration,'' William H. Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said yesterday.
5/1/2000	Seattle Absorbs Microsoft News Without Fuss	It is an idea once considered unthinkable, and still widely viewed here as unlikely. And it is an idea that many people respond to with visceral criticism, or diatribes about a distant federal government picking on a homegrown winner. But in the Seattle region, where Microsoft has generated a staggering amount of wealth, only to see more than $100 billion of it vanish in recent weeks, the idea of breaking up the company hardly seems to be setting off widespread panic.
5/1/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Hard Questions for Government Advisers	As stock analysts pored over Friday's filings in the government's proposal to split Microsoft in two, some marveled as much about what was missing as what was included. In particular, bankers and analysts who have read an affidavit prepared by the firm of the investment banker Robert F. Greenhill, which defended the feasibility of such a step, said the affidavit fell short of justifying why a breakup would be good for Microsoft shareholders.
5/1/2000	Pondering The Impact Of a Breakup; Some Say It May Be Too Late To Dismantle Microsoft	In the government's proposal to break up Microsoft and set new ground rules for its business practices, the beneficiaries are supposed to include other software companies -- especially the little guys. But so far, reaction to the government's proposed helping hand seems muted, or outright skeptical, among software developers -- the primarily small and midsized companies that create a variety of products that make computers work faster or more easily, or that act as tools used by other programmers.
4/30/2000	For Now, Microsoft Can't Save Itself	NOW that the government has formally proposed a breakup of Microsoft, some investors may expect its depressed shares to rebound, simply because the company's worst fate is clear. If the shares do recover, though, it will have to be with one of the biggest buyers of Microsoft shares stuck on the market's sidelines: Microsoft itself.

4/30/2000	PC Users Express Concern That Split May Hurt Them	While lawyers and regulators in Washington ponder the fate of the Microsoft Corporation, Troy Anthony stands in a computer store here, struggling with the conflict the case inspires in ordinary consumers. He says he feels strongly that Microsoft should not be divided in a way that destroys the Windows standard he already knows how to use. But what brought him and his laptop to the PC@more store on a busy weekday afternoon? ''I've got a bug in Windows 98,'' he said sheepishly. Mr. Anthony added that he had developed a not-so-technical remedy for the times his operating system crashes. ''I know how to reboot the computer.''
4/30/2000	Investing; Microsoft's Competition Is Looking Attractive	MICROSOFT'S biggest problem is not the court case,'' Lawrence J. Ellison, chief executive of the Oracle Corporation, said at a meeting with securities analysts earlier this month. ''Their biggest problem is Windows 2000.'' Mr. Ellison often makes that sort of remark. But given the attention being paid to various facets of the government's antitrust action against Microsoft, including formal proposals for breaking up the company, his larger point is one that investors may want to keep in mind: In an increasingly Web-centric world, Microsoft's fortunes are still married to an operating system and a business model that focus on the desktop.
4/30/2000	PC Users Are Wary Of a Microsoft Split	When the legal theory, public-relations spin and courtroom drama die out, the winner in the government's antitrust case is supposed to be the consumer, with heightened competition yielding more innovative, less expensive products. But many consumers are skeptical. Article, Page 32.
4/30/2000	The Case for a Breakup	The overriding policy goal of a remedy in the Microsoft antitrust case, the government has said repeatedly, is to make the world safe for future innovation. The door to fair competition must be left open, the government insisted, so that Microsoft cannot thwart its next head-on challenger with illegal tactics as it did Netscape Communications, the pioneer in Internet browsing software. In their papers supporting the government's proposal to split Microsoft into two companies, three economists have identified the challenger that could be the ''next Netscape'': Microsoft's own Office suite of software, like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.
4/30/2000	Reckonings; Dirty Windows Policy	So now it's official. The Justice Department has requested a breakup of Microsoft into two companies -- one piece that gets the rights to Windows and a defenestrated rump that gets the rights to everything else, mainly Microsoft Office. In my last column I offered a metaphor: a baron who controls two castles along the Rhine, and extracts tolls from passing traffic. The Justice Department proposal is like letting the baron keep one castle, while giving the other to his nephew. That metaphor suggests that such a breakup would make things worse, with two robber barons instead of one levying tolls on those who pass by. Why, then, does Justice think otherwise?
4/30/2000	A Tangled Path To the Decision To Seek a Split	When it all began two years ago, with the federal and state governments filing their landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft, Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general in Wisconsin, was struck with a numbing fear: What would the plaintiffs do if they actually won the case against one of the richest and most powerful companies in America? ''It's like the dog chasing the bus,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''What's he going to do if he catches it?''
4/29/2000	A Name That Wall Street Trusts Sees a Net Gain for Shareholders	When the Justice Department started its search for an investment banker to help it sort through the financial implications of breaking up Microsoft, Robert F. Greenhill quickly seemed to be the logical choice. Joel I. Klein, head of the department's antitrust division, needed a Wall Street expert. Mr. Greenhill had already run two investment banks, and after 37 years in the business, he has the respect of corporate America, making him a credible voice if he is required to testify.
4/29/2000	Excerpts From Plaintiffs' Memorandum Supporting Their Case	Following are key portions of the plaintiffs' supporting memorandum filed yesterday in the Microsoft antitrust case:
4/29/2000	A 'Surgical' Solution	Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft two years ago, Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, explained in a private meeting his concept of ''surgical'' government intervention. In the case of Microsoft, he said, it could well include breaking up the company. ''It would be drastic surgery, but it's surgical,'' Mr. Klein said, according to a person who attended the meeting.
4/29/2000	Attorneys General of Illinois and Ohio Dissent	Following is the appendix to the memorandum filed by the attorneys general of Illinois and Ohio, explaining their differences with some of the remedies proposed by the other plaintiffs. This Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law eloquently point out the harm caused by Microsoft's illegal, anti-competitive conduct which needs to be addressed by the remedies which this Court will impose. The record, and the Court's Findings of Fact, are replete with examples of stifled innovation, increased costs, unnecessary consumer confusion, forestalled technological advances, and thwarted competition caused by Microsoft's conduct.
4/29/2000	U.S. AND 17 STATES ASK JUDGE TO CUT MICROSOFT IN 2 PARTS; SERIOUS CURBS ALSO SOUGHT	Determined to change the rules of competition in the software industry, the Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge today to break Microsoft into two parts and seriously restrain its behavior while the breakup is being carried out. Federal and state officials, partners in the long-running antitrust case against Microsoft, said their approach was intended to encourage market forces to reshape incentives in the software industry. The two resulting companies, they said, would have strong motivations to compete with each other while also forming new alliances with other companies and products that Microsoft now shuns.

4/29/2000	At Microsoft's Home Base, Vitriol and a Sense of Unfairness	''Very disturbing,'' ''unprecedented,'' ''out of bounds,'' ''extreme'' and ''radical'' were a few of the angry words that came out of William H. Gates's mouth shortly after the government's formal proposal today to break up Microsoft, the software company he co-founded 25 years ago and built into a high-technology giant. ''This was not developed by anyone who knows anything about the software business,'' Mr. Gates said.
4/29/2000	Rivals Cheer, Saying a Breakup Would Reignite Competition in Software	The government's proposal to break up Microsoft and force it to adhere to a stiff set of sanctions limiting its power would reignite competition in the software industry, a variety of computer industry executives said today. The Justice Department's plan, outlined in a 17-page filing this afternoon with Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, would create two powerful companies, one with the world's dominant operating systems, covering a variety of different types of computers, and one with a wide range of software applications and development tools.
4/28/2000	Break Up Microsoft?	To the Editor: Of course Paul Krugman is right that, along with the loss of a uniform standard that allows many kinds of software to interact freely, a Microsoft breakup risks increasing prices (''Microsoft: What Next?'', column, April 26). But that's precisely why so many Microsoft rivals favor it.
4/28/2000	The Remedy for Microsoft	The Justice Department is expected to propose to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson today that he break Microsoft in two -- a dramatic remedy for the antitrust violations that he recently ruled the company had committed. A breakup might seem to be overkill. But the inconvenient truth is that less drastic remedies are apt to be less effective and might involve government or court officials taking a permanent oversight role in the American software industry, hampering its evolution. Microsoft is the latest target of antitrust laws designed to prohibit companies from conspiring by way of mergers, contracts or other forms of cooperation to reduce consumer choice. Though the laws do not outlaw monopolies, they do prohibit a single company from deliberately creating or maintaining a monopoly through anti-competitive practices rather than simply selling a product that is better or cheaper than someone else's product. The laws, which are generally stricter in the United States than in other industrialized countries, have been used with uneven results to go after industry giants like Standard Oil, Alcoa, I.B.M. and AT&T.
4/28/2000	Officials Seek Unified Front On Microsoft	On the eve of the filing deadline, many of the 19 state attorneys general who are part of the antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation were lobbying and cajoling a handful of their colleagues today to join the majority and ask the court to break Microsoft into two parts. A few attorneys general view this remedy proposal, favored by the Justice Department and most of the states involved, as too extreme. But the others fear that a fractured decision could harm the government's case and give power to any Microsoft argument that not even the plaintiffs agree on this remedy.
4/28/2000	Xerox and Microsoft Create Digital Safeguard Company	The Xerox Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation said today that they would create a company to produce and market software that protects copyrighted materials like books, music and video distributed over the Internet. The new company, ContentGuard Inc., is being spun out of Xerox and is based on technology developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. A public offering is anticipated. Microsoft will own a minority stake in ContentGuard, which will have headquarters in McLean, Va., and operations in Palo Alto, Calif., and El Segundo, Calif.
4/27/2000	States Said to Back Proposal From U.S. To Divide Microsoft	The federal government and the states that are partners in the antitrust suit against Microsoft agreed today to file a joint proposal on remedies in the case and back a plan to break Microsoft into two companies, officials said. The joint proposal had been in doubt earlier in the day but this evening it included elements that state officials had proposed to strengthen interim restrictions on Microsoft's conduct.
4/27/2000	Microsoft Offers A Dictionary That Talks	If you're baffled by the upside-down characters and odd accents most dictionaries use to show pronunciation, you're not alone. ''It's a very widespread perception,'' said Richard Bready, managing editor of the Microsoft Encarta Dictionary. Microsoft's answer, which went online this month, is a dictionary that talks. About 60,000 of the roughly 100,000 word entries posted on the Encarta World English Dictionary site (www.encarta.com) contain a small speaker icon. When clicked, it produces a tiny audio clip of what Mr. Bready and his 300 lexicographers have determined to be a word's most common pronunciation in the United States. The emotionless male voice that supplies the pronunciations for the dictionary's sound clips belongs to an actor ''chosen primarily for his clarity of speech,'' said Jeffrey Smith, the group product manager for Encarta.
4/27/2000	Breaking Up Microsoft?	The government faces a formidable legal challenge in trying to persuade a federal judge to split up the Microsoft Corporation, but not an insurmountable one by any means, according to antitrust experts. ''It would be somewhat of a stretch,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School, ''but I think the breakup that has been suggested is consistent with the broad and flexible historical legal standard in antitrust.''
4/27/2000	PSION IN LINK WITH SONY	Europe's dominant manufacturer of palm-top computers, Psion P.L.C., said the Sony Corporation of Japan had agreed to license its Symbian operating system for a new generation of wireless devices. Allied with Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola in developing the Symbian platform, Psion is battling the Microsoft Corporation over what analysts expect to be a booming market in Internet-linked mobile devices.

4/26/2000	Reckonings; Microsoft: What Next?	Baron Wilhelm von Gates was the lord of two castles, each commanding a strategic bottleneck along the Rhine. From these castles he was able to demand money from all the travelers who passed by. This made him wealthy, but also much disliked. Eventually the Holy Roman Emperor was persuaded to curb the robber baron's power; he split up the Gates domain, giving one of the castles to the baron's nephew. But the results of this breakup were not quite what the emperor's legal department had promised. In fact, travelers complained that things had gotten even worse. Not only did they now face the nuisance of dealing with two different robber barons, but they said they were paying more for each trip than they had before.
4/26/2000	Microsoft Management Tells Workers There Will Be No Breakup	As some industry executives declared that a government move to break up Microsoft could inject new competition into the software business, Microsoft's top management confidently assured its 34,000 employees yesterday that there was no chance the company would be split up. And to further calm any anxious workers, Microsoft told them they would all receive new stock options to shield them financially from the recent slide in the company's stock price.
4/25/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Investors Find Vulnerability In Microsoft	Since it first sold shares to the public 14 years ago, Microsoft has become more than a software company. As it turned in steady increases in profit and revenue quarter after quarter, year after year, Microsoft convinced an entire generation of investors that no price was too rich to pay for a leading technology company. Sure, Microsoft's stock price always seemed expensive relative to its current earnings. But a year or two later, those earnings were much higher, and so was Microsoft's stock.
4/25/2000	Big Companies Back New Intel Chip Rival	Transmeta, which aims to take on Intel in the processor market, announced today that it had received $88 million in financing from America Online and other heavyweights. Gateway, Compaq, Sony and several major Taiwan electronics manufacturers joined with AOL to invest $72 million.
4/23/2000	The Maniac Markets; Sun, in Blazing Color	Ask Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, about Sun Microsystems and he sees red. It is not just that Mr. Ballmer views Scott McNealy, Sun's co-founder and chief executive, as a ringleader of a Silicon Valley cabal that persuaded the Justice Department to pursue its antitrust investigation of Microsoft. Sun has also been in Microsoft's cross hairs ever since Microsoft began trying to move up the computer industry food chain in the early 1990's.
4/22/2000	Insurer Fighting Microsoft Over Claims	Microsoft's primary insurer wants to bar the company from claiming coverage for the cost of defending a barrage of private antitrust lawsuits. In a suit filed last month in Federal District Court in Washington, Zurich American Insurance, a unit of Zurich Allied of Switzerland, asked a judge to declare that its general liability policy does not cover the legal expenses caused by Microsoft's antitrust woes.
4/21/2000	Microsoft Sees Some Bumps In Its Earnings	Microsoft reported yesterday that third-quarter earnings were a couple of cents above Wall Street's expectations, but the number everyone was watching from this bellwether of the PC industry was revenue, which trailed most analysts' estimates. The softness in the quarter was largely anticipated, but the company also urged analysts to reduce estimates for future revenue and earnings as well.
4/20/2000	States at Odds On Remedies For Microsoft	State and federal officials trying to prepare remedy proposals in the Microsoft antitrust case have not settled on a common approach, officials say, and the states are having trouble agreeing even among themselves. On one critical point, officials say, the 19 states involved now seem in accord: none is advocating a fundamental breakup of the company. ''Everybody's in that mode,'' said one official with knowledge of the negotiations. And there are indications that the Justice Department concurs.
4/18/2000	Microsoft Will Challenge Palm's Hand-Held Computer Dominance	With impressive new software for hand-held computers, Microsoft will start tomorrow what industry analysts regard as its first serious challenge to Palm Inc., the leader in the fast-growing market for pocket-sized machines. Microsoft's new version of its Pocket PC software can play music in the popular MP3 audio format, display electronic books in the first major introduction of the company's Cleartype software and play video clips. Compared with earlier versions of its software, it also has an easier-to-use interface for retrieving personal contacts, schedules and to-do lists -- the basic functions of the small electronic organizers, a category pioneered by Palm.
4/16/2000	How to Give Away $21.8 Billion	One of the ways in which the very rich are different from you and me is that they become public property. Just about everyone has an opinion about Bill Gates's business tactics, products, motives, character, house -- and about what he should be doing with his immense fortune. Before he began giving money away, people complained that he was a miser. Now that he is giving money away, they complain that he's doing it too late, that he isn't giving enough, that he hasn't a clue about what he's getting into, that the projects he is financing are too conservative, too liberal, too big, too small, too safe, too risky, too conventional, too splashy. Or they say he's only doing it to avoid taxes, or to expand Microsoft's markets, or, especially, to improve his image in light of the government's high-profile antitrust suit.
4/13/2000	Microsoft Shares Fall on Analyst's Report	For a day, blame it on Richard Sherlund, Wall Street's leading Microsoft analyst. He trimmed his first-quarter revenue estimates for the big software maker yesterday, and Microsoft's stock price fell sharply, taking the Nasdaq market and the shares of most technology companies with it. Mr. Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, did not reduce his earnings estimate for Microsoft, and he kept the company on Goldman's recommended list. But his warning of lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter -- results that Microsoft will report on April 20 -- was viewed as a signal of a general slowing in the growth of the personal computer industry.
4/13/2000	New Recliner From La-Z-Boy Is Built for Mouse Potatoes	Compared with sitting on a comfy couch, using an old-fashioned remote control to surf through a mere 100 channels on cable television, surfing millions of World Wide Web pages using WebTV and a keyboard can be physically exhausting. At least that seems to be the thinking behind the La-Z-Boy Explorer ''e-cliner,'' a plush new reclining chair that may be the first piece of furniture to come with a two-month subscription to the Microsoft's WebTV service.
4/12/2000	Corrections	A front-page article yesterday about a lobbying campaign by Microsoft misstated the company's explanation at one point for hiring Century Strategies, Ralph Reed's firm. As the article noted, a Microsoft spokesman said Century Stategy's specific aim was to counter a lobbying campaign against the company being waged by its competitors. The spokesman did not say that its aim was to curry favor with Gov. George W. Bush.
4/12/2000	MICROSOFT INVESTS IN JAPAN	The world's biggest software company, the Microsoft Corporation, acquired a majority stake in Japan's second-biggest cable television operator as it expands into networks offering high-capacity Internet access. Microsoft bought the entire 60 percent stake in Titus Communications held by the United States cable television company MediaOne Group, according to Yoichi Hiraoka, a Titus spokesman. Financial terms were not disclosed though reports last year said Microsoft was prepared to pay close to $1 billion for the stake. Japan's former telephone monopoly, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, has dragged its feet on offering low-cost access to the Internet.
4/12/2000	Bush Adviser Apologizes for Lobbying Effort	Ralph Reed, a senior consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, apologized today for lobbying the governor on behalf of the Microsoft Corporation and promised not to lobby him again on behalf of Microsoft or anyone else. ''It is an error that we regret,'' said a statement issued by Mr. Reed's office at Century Strategies, the lobbying and political consulting firm he heads.
4/11/2000	An Online Scoop on Microsoft Goes Poof	For a few hours early yesterday, The Wall Street Journal's Web site heralded a scoop: The Microsoft Corporation, embroiled in an antitrust battle, might be forced by the Justice Department to make the programming code for its Internet Explorer Web browser available to customers and computer makers. The Reuters news agency picked up the article, and sent it to its news customers around the world. But, just as radio stations and others were broadcasting the news, the Journal removed the report from the Web site. Dick Tofel, a spokesman for the newspaper, would neither confirm the article's accuracy, nor give details about why it was removed.
4/11/2000	Microsoft Hires A Bush Adviser To Lobby Bush	The Microsoft Corporation has quietly hired Ralph Reed, a senior consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, to lobby Mr. Bush in opposition to the government's antitrust case against the software giant. Microsoft's aim, the company says, is to curry favor with the apparent Republican presidential nominee, hoping he will speak out against the government's case -- and, perhaps, take a softer approach toward the company if he is elected president.
4/10/2000	Outrunning the Law?	To the Editor: Robert W. Hahn (''Microsoft, a Monopoly No More,'' Op-Ed, April 7) argues that any remedy for Microsoft's anti-competitive behavior would be irrelevant in today's fast-paced technological world since the nature of the field renders court-imposed remedies out of date before they can actually be imposed. According to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling, Microsoft continues to break the law, operating with its practices and its policies virtually unchanged. Mr. Hahn's reasoning suggests that technology companies may do as they please, regardless of the law, because by the time a case meanders through the courts, it is irrelevant.
4/10/2000	Should Microsoft's Fate Be in Private Hands?	With a federal judge ruling last week that Microsoft repeatedly violated the law, the government has the easy part of the antitrust case behind it. The real policy challenge comes now: what are the right remedies? Last week's ruling, of course, came because of the breakdown of four months of settlement talks --- mediated by Judge Richard A. Posner, a federal judgejurist who is regarded as one of the leading thinkers on antitrust --- in which the two sides could not agree on the appropriate remedies.
4/9/2000	Of Two Minds on Microsoft: Wall Street After the Ruling; The Bears: Rivals Are Pulling Ahead	Investors in Microsoft were busy last week, buffeting the stock in the wake of Monday's antitrust ruling against the company by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The shares ended Friday at $89.0625, down 16 percent for the week and 25 percent from their high of $119.125 on Dec. 27. With the company's future uncertain, should investors buy on the dip? Run for the doors? Here are best cases for hanging on or cutting back. THE bear growling at Microsoft's door today is the government's antitrust case and the uncertainty it creates. But the bear that may be around longer is in the cages at data centers, or so-called hosting companies, like Exodus Communications. These cages house thousands of linked PC's running on the lean Linux operating system for Internet companies like Yahoo.
4/9/2000	Reckonings; Rights Of Bill	I don't know anyone outside Seattle who is really pro-Microsoft. But a lot of us are, at least mildly, anti-anti-Microsoft. That is, we worry that the crusade against Bill Gates sets a bad, even dangerous precedent. Let's admit the obvious: Microsoft has what amounts to a monopoly position in the operating system market. You can argue that potential competitors have always limited Microsoft's pricing power, and anyway as we move from the wired to the wireless age that monopoly is a rapidly wasting asset. But the dominance of Microsoft's position is hard to dispute (and the company's efforts to claim otherwise, by their very implausibility, did a lot of damage to its case).
4/9/2000	IDEAS & TRENDS: Open Windows; The New Math Of Monopoly	THE scorecard in the Microsoft case, according to Attorney General Janet Reno, is simple: Microsoft lost and America's consumers won. After a federal judge ruled on Monday that Microsoft was a monopolistic predator that had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, Ms. Reno declared, ''Thanks to this ruling, consumers who have been harmed can now look forward to benefits.''
4/9/2000	Business & Investing; Microsoft's Woes Bring Little Good for Others	WILL any stocks gain from Microsoft's pain? Maybe not. In May 1998, when the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general filed the antitrust suit against Microsoft, there was still an independent company called Netscape Communications that might have benefited from the judge's ruling last week -- a ruling that seems likely to result in a bar against Microsoft's bundling its browser with Windows. But Netscape is now a division of America Online. And though it released a well-received new version of Navigator last week, it seems unlikely to ever recapture the market share lost to Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
4/9/2000	Of Two Minds on Microsoft: Wall Street After the Ruling; The Bulls: Hey, the Worst Is Over	Investors in Microsoft were busy last week, buffeting the stock in the wake of Monday's antitrust ruling against the company by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The shares ended Friday at $89.0625, down 16 percent for the week and 25 percent from their high of $119.125 on Dec. 27. With the company's future uncertain, should investors buy on the dip? Run for the doors? Here are best cases for hanging on or cutting back. BUY low, sell high.
4/8/2000	Microsoft Plans A New Strategy For the Internet	Once a week, in the corporate boardroom, Microsoft's chief software architect takes refuge from the antitrust storm raging around the company's Redmond, Wash., campus to meet with a handpicked group of designers who are hammering out the company's future. The chief architect is William H. Gates, who in January stepped down as chief executive, turning his attention toward a loosely articulated vision of a future in which the company's business moves away from the personal computer and onto the Internet.
4/8/2000	A Horse Thief, Updated	To the Editor: Re ''Microsoft, a Monopoly No More'' (Op-Ed, April 7): Robert W. Hahn implies that technological progress in a free market somehow heals all wounds. This notion is flawed, in my view. By that reasoning, a guy who stole a horse in the early part of the 20th century was blameless, since horses were soon to be replaced by cars.
4/7/2000	Microsoft, A Monopoly No More	Apparently, justice will try to be swift now that Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has declared that Microsoft maintained a monopoly in personal computer operating systems by anticompetitive means. But even if the judge accomplishes his goal of compressing the remedy and appeals process, he may find that his decision is too late. The technology business has changed light years in just the two years since this case was filed, and it's hard to imagine a judicial remedy that would be relevant.
4/7/2000	Gates Appears in Microsoft Television Ad	William H. Gates is on videotape again. And the antitrust case against his company is again the backdrop. But this time he is taking his case directly to the people. The Microsoft Corporation began a television advertising campaign yesterday featuring Mr. Gates, its chairman, pointing to Microsoft's record of innovation and determination to carry on.
4/6/2000	Microsoft Lost. What About the Consumer?	To the Editor: Re ''Microsoft's Illegal Monopoly'' (editorial, April 4): You lament that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson will likely not break up Microsoft, but you don't justify such a drastic remedy.
4/6/2000	A Move to Bypass Appeals Court in the Microsoft Case	Stung after a major reversal by his superiors on the appeals court on a central issue in the Microsoft antitrust case nearly two years ago, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has responded in kind this week. On Monday, Judge Jackson took the unusual path of rebuking the appeals court, casting aside its reasoning as ''not formally binding'' and rebuking it for failing to follow the Supreme Court precedents ''in at least three respects.'' The appeals court had found that Judge Jackson was wrong on the law when he ordered Microsoft to immediately unbundle its Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer Web browser.
4/6/2000	Microsoft Lost. What About the Consumer?	To the Editor: Robert X. Cringely (''Microsoft's Real Worry,'' Op-Ed, April 5) writes, ''How enduring can a monopoly be if it is composed entirely of electrons?'' Microsoft's monopoly includes more. It includes the power of government behind its copyrights and patents.
4/6/2000	Fast Action Sought By Microsoft Judge To Find a Remedy	The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case set a ''fast track'' schedule today intended to conclude the proceedings and impose a remedy roughly by the end of May. And with that deadline looming, the state attorneys general, the plaintiffs who have favored the strongest remedies, are coalescing around the view that they will not ask the judge to break up the company, several officials said today. The decision on timing came in a meeting this morning of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and lawyers for the government and Microsoft.
4/6/2000	Dust Settles on Markets That Are More Volatile	At high noon Tuesday, after a rocky morning, United States stocks pitched into a 90-minute free fall. By the time the dive ended, shares in some of the market's biggest and most important companies, from Internet leaders like Yahoo to corporate titans like General Electric, had fallen 5, 10 or even 15 percent. There was no news bulletin to explain the decline, no mad rumor of presidential ill health or war in Asia, only a tidal wave of selling. Then, just as quickly, the market turned, and many stocks finished the day close to where they began, or even up slightly.
4/5/2000	Microsoft's Real Worry	Robert X Cringely Op-Ed article perceives many ironies and bizarre elements in antitrust suit against Microsoft, not least of which is that federal government itself has mandated that only Microsoft applications and file formats be employed for its internal uses; predicts real benefit of court ruling against company will be that Microsoft will have to be more careful about how it does business (M)
4/5/2000	Expedited Appeal Proposed by Judge in Microsoft Case	The presiding judge in the Microsoft antitrust case, meeting with lawyers for both sides in Washington yesterday, said he wanted to put the remedy phase of the case on a ''fast track'' and consider encouraging the litigants to appeal the outcome directly to the Supreme Court, according to a transcript of the meeting. One day after he issued his judgment that found Microsoft in broad violation of the nation's antitrust laws, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson laid out a tight schedule for filings from both parties every 10 or 15 days ''under a genuine fast track which would enable us to conclude the remedy phase within 60 days'' of Monday, he said.
4/5/2000	Microsoft Decision: In Whose Interest?	To the Editor: As Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has ruled, Microsoft certainly used anti-competitive means to maintain a monopoly for its PC operating system software (front page, April 4). The facts seem clear. On what basis, then, is Microsoft planning to appeal? In the short term, giving Microsoft free rein could have some benefits for consumers, as it argues. There could well be short-term benefits in having uniform standards and one producer. In the short term it would also be more convenient to have one national airline and one telephone system. But in the long term we consumers lose. Monopolies reduce innovation and raise prices.
4/5/2000	Corrections	Headlines in Business Day yesterday about the aborted mediation in the Microsoft antitrust case referred to one issue imprecisely. While a Justice Department proposal would have prevented Microsoft from forcing personal-computer makers to accept additional features as a condition of licensing the Windows operating system, it did not bar Microsoft from incorporating new software features in Windows.
4/4/2000	Rivals Talk Of Splitting The Giant	Reinvigorated by today's ruling in the Microsoft antitrust case, the Microsoft Corporation's competitors in Silicon Valley today renewed their calls for harsh ''structural'' sanctions that would lead to the breakup of the company, the nation's largest independent software marker. The shift in the debate away from so-called ''conduct'' remedies, which would have regulated or restricted Microsoft's market power but would have left the company intact, came after negotiations between the Justice Department, state attorneys general and Microsoft fell apart on Saturday.
4/4/2000	Relying on the Act: Sherman Antitrust	The Sherman Antitrust Act, passed in 1890, outlaws all contracts, combinations and conspiracies that unreasonably restrain interstate trade. Common examples are price fixing and bid rigging. The act also makes it a crime to monopolize any part of interstate commerce. An unlawful violation occurs when a company dominates or attempts to dominate the market for a product or service, but only if it has sought, achieved or maintained that dominance by suppressing competition with anticompetitive conduct.
4/4/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Wipeout on Nasdaq Goes Well Beyond the Pummeling of Microsoft	It wasn't just Microsoft. The Nasdaq composite index endured one of its worst days ever yesterday, as technology stocks broadly sold off. The decline, 7.6 percent, was the worst daily performance for the index since the summer of 1998.
4/4/2000	Reaction in the Northwest Favors Gates and Company Even as the Stock's Value Falls by Billions of Dollars	When Microsoft got its legal thrashing from a federal judge today, the Seattle area's roaring economy got a bit of a jolt, too. With about 40 percent of the company's stock in the hands of people who live in the region, roughly $32 billion, on paper anyway, vanished here between the time William H. Gates and Steve Ballmer, the company's two top leaders, rose this morning and the time they stepped to a podium here to respond to the judge's finding. But sounding no less self-assured than they have throughout their antitrust battle with the government, both men calmly defended the software giant's actions, predicted vindication in both the marketplace and the legal arena, and reiterated a through-the-looking-glass depiction of how government prosecutors had misunderstood the company.
4/4/2000	Nasdaq Index, Heavy With High-Technology Stocks, Is Driven Down 7.6%	The Nasdaq stock market, the source of much of the new wealth created during the 1990's, lost a big chunk of its value yesterday, recording its fifth-biggest decline ever in percentage terms. After news over the weekend that settlement efforts had ended between Microsoft and the government in its landmark antitrust case, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite moved sharply lower from the start of trading.
4/4/2000	Excerpts From the Ruling That Microsoft Violated Antitrust Law	Following are excerpts from the main points of the ruling yesterday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court in Washington in the antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW The United States, 19 individual states, and the District of Columbia (''the plaintiffs'') bring these consolidated civil enforcement actions against defendant Microsoft Corporation (''Microsoft'') under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The plaintiffs charge, in essence, that Microsoft has waged an unlawful campaign in defense of its monopoly position in the market for operating systems designed to run on Intel-compatible personal computers (''PC's''). Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that Microsoft violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by engaging in a series of exclusionary, anticompetitive, and predatory acts to maintain its monopoly power. They also assert that Microsoft attempted, albeit unsuccessfully to date, to monopolize the Web browser market, likewise in violation of Section 2. Finally, they contend that certain steps taken by Microsoft as part of its campaign to protect its monopoly power, namely tying its browser to its operating system and entering into exclusive dealing arrangements, violated Section 1 of the Act.
4/4/2000	Microsoft's Illegal Monopoly	With settlement talks having broken down, the judge overseeing the government's antitrust case against Microsoft issued a stinging ruling yesterday that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws by abusing its monopoly position over Windows, the operating system that controls the vast majority of personal computers. The ruling, which supported most but not all of the government's accusations, deserves wide credence. It was carefully grounded in antitrust doctrine and the facts presented at trial. Now the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, moves on to the far harder task of concocting a remedy. Here he will find no completely satisfactory options.
4/4/2000	U.S. JUDGE SAYS MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAWS WITH PREDATORY BEHAVIOR	The Microsoft Corporation violated the nation's antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ''an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal judge ruled today. The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area. [Excerpts, Page C14.]
4/4/2000	An Eye on the Next Step	When Joel I. Klein filed the government's antitrust case against Microsoft nearly two years ago, he sent courtesy copies of the 53-page legal complaint to a number of appellate judges and Supreme Court justices. The move by Mr. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, appeared to reflect the Justice Department's judgment that -- for all of the importance of the trial before Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson -- the fate of the case would ultimately be in the hands of a higher authority.
4/4/2000	What Comes Next: Deciding the Penalty	Now that the decision is in, the Microsoft trial shifts to a new phase during which the penalty, or remedy, will be decided. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told the parties to the case that he wants to hold a separate hearing as part of his deliberations over a remedy. He has not said how it will be structured or when it will begin. But Microsoft and the government will at least be asked to file written proposals describing their proposed remedies. The 19 state attorneys general and the Justice Department together are to file a single proposal.
4/4/2000	4 Months, 19 Settlement Offers, 0 Agreements	In four months of settlement talks, Microsoft and the Justice Department prepared 19 proposals and counterproposals dealing with fine points of software in the technical parlance of ''source code'' and ''application program interfaces.'' Microsoft executives say they were finishing a reply to the Justice Department's latest offer when the federal judge acting as mediator halted the talks on Saturday. At that point, the two sides had moved toward agreement on some elements but were still apart on others, according to people close to the talks.
4/4/2000	U.S. to Examine Remedies That Fit the Offense	Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said today that they would examine possible remedies to put an end to what a federal judge described as the giant software company's monopolistic practices. In his ruling, United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. His decision will provide the basis for further court hearings -- and possibly settlement negotiations -- to determine what legal remedies to impose on Microsoft. The company said it would appeal.
4/3/2000	Slate Holds Discussions About a Version for Britain	Slate, the online magazine, is casting its eyes across the Atlantic. The Web magazine, which is owned by Microsoft, is looking to set up its own British-based clone, offering readers its blend of intellectual banter -- with an accent. ''We've kicked around the idea for a while, but have just started focusing on it in the past month,'' said Scott Moore, Slate's publisher. ''We haven't done a deal, so there's nothing official to announce yet.''
4/3/2000	Antitrust Alliance Not Quite Solid	As the settlement talks between Microsoft and the government foundered last weekend, so it appeared did the relationship between the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general who together filed antitrust suits against the software giant almost two years ago. Over the weekend, an official allied with the states complained that the Justice Department had been trying to ram through an inadequate settlement proposal without bothering to involve them. But a lawyer who was close to the talks had a different point of view, saying the states were trying to snatch credit for sinking the talks in part because ''they're tired of being in the back seat.''
4/3/2000	Analysts See Risk for Microsoft, But Gates Hopes to Win Appeal	With the collapse of settlement talks in its federal antitrust case, Microsoft finds itself facing a harsh legal road ahead that threatens to embolden private litigants, depress the company's stock price and erode its dominant influence in computing, according to industry analysts. ''Microsoft is now back in the legal quagmire, and nothing good is going to happen to the company anytime soon,'' said David Readerman, a managing director at Thomas Weisel Partners, a technology investment firm in San Francisco.
4/2/2000	Microsoft and U.S. Unable To Reach Antitrust Accord	After four months, mediation efforts between Microsoft and the government were abandoned today, making it likely that the presiding judge in the trial will issue his decision in the long-running antitrust case in the next few days. The announcement came from the court-appointed mediator, Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago. ''The disagreements among the parties concerning the likely course, outcome, and consequences of continued litigation,'' Judge Posner said, ''as well as the implications and ramifications of alternative terms of settlement, are too deep-seated to be bridged.'' [Text, Page 22.]
3/31/2000	Microsoft Venture With 2 Phone Giants	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it would work with British Telecommunications and AT&T to develop high-speed wireless Internet software, furthering Microsoft's push into the wireless market. The terms of their agreement were not disclosed. The companies plan to use Microsoft software to deliver a broader set of Internet services than those now available on cellular phones. The services, which are expected to be offered after testing this fall, will include access to company data for business customers and interactive games, electronic books and music on home PC's.
3/31/2000	In Search Of Loopholes In the Offer By Microsoft	Over and over again for the last several years, the Microsoft Corporation has asserted that separating its Web browser from Windows was impossible. And yet, in settlement talks with the government, the company has reportedly offered to do just that. One possible reason for this change of heart, some experts say, is that it does not matter anymore.
3/29/2000	Judge in Microsoft Case Delays a Ruling as Mediation Intensifies	The federal mediator in the Microsoft antitrust case has told officials that he may be able to broker a settlement, prompting the trial judge to delay his ruling, which had been due today. The court-appointed mediator, Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago, has laid out an aggressive weeklong schedule of proposals and counterproposals between Microsoft and the Department of Justice. It stipulates that if there is no agreement by next Wednesday, the mediation will end.
3/28/2000	Talks in Microsoft Case Continue as Judge's Decision Looms	An appointed mediator continued working feverishly this evening to work out an 11th-hour settlement in the antitrust case against Microsoft. But opinions among some of the government officials who filed the suit appeared to be hardening, setting up the likelihood that the trial judge would issue a verdict as soon as Tuesday. In interviews today, some officials said they thought Microsoft's settlement proposal, offered last Friday, was simply inadequate on its face. Others said they did not trust Microsoft to live up to its promises.
3/26/2000	A Strange Brew's Buzz Lingers in Silicon Valley	IN June 1975, a solitary computer hacker slipped quietly into a van in the parking lot of a local hotel, Rickey's Hyatt House, and ''borrowed'' a copy of Microsoft BASIC, the first commercial program from a tiny Albuquerque, N.M., company started by two other young hackers, William H. Gates and Paul G. Allen. The van was on a nationwide tour to show off the MITS Altair 8800, one of the world's first personal computers. The program -- stored as a set of punched holes in a long paper tape -- was ''liberated'' to be shared by a rag-tag group of Silicon Valley computer hobbyists who that March -- 25 years ago this month -- had banded together as the Homebrew Computer Club.
3/26/2000	Officials Say Microsoft Bid To Settle Suit Is Inadequate	After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant, officials said this afternoon. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
3/25/2000	Microsoft Said To Offer Plan For Settlement	With two federal judges pressing Microsoft and the government to settle their antitrust case soon, Microsoft presented a formal written proposal today that would restrain some of the company's business practices, officials said. Lawyers for the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general were studying the proposal tonight to decide whether it was promising enough to warrant weekend negotiations.
3/23/2000	Microsoft Awards Account for X-Box	The Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash., has expanded its relationship with McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising by awarding the account for a new video game console called X-Box, to McCann-Erickson New York. Billings were estimated at more than $100 million.
3/22/2000	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Microsoft and Telmex Plan A Latin Region Web Portal	Microsoft Corp chairman William H Gates joins forces with richest man in Latin America, Carlos Slim Helu, in battle to dominate Internet in region by creating portal site that combines expertise of Microsoft with communications reach of Telefonos de Mexico; Gates says portal site, called tlmsn.com, began with six million users; Spanish-speaking subscribers to Prodigy, Internet service to Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, and to Microsoft's msn.com are automatically channeled to new portal; Gates says Web explorer program on all personal computers with Microsoft operating software sold in Latin America will have tlmsn.com as first port of entry to Internet; photo (M)
3/16/2000	Microsoft Grades Windows 2000 Debut	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's biggest software maker, said this week that it had distributed more than one million copies of Windows 2000 since introducing the software upgrade for business computers and networks Feb. 17. The company, based here, also said Windows 2000 had generated fewer support calls than any other Microsoft operating system. The sales figure does not include copies being used by some of Microsoft's largest customers, the company said.
3/16/2000	Money Is Pledged to Close Digital Divide on Campuses	Microsoft, I.B.M. and AT&T last week pledged more than $101 million worth of materials, software, services, training and financial support for a newly announced program of the United Negro College Fund. The program is designed to improve computer access for students and faculty at the fund's 39 member institutions, which are all historically black colleges and universities. The aim of the $130 million program, said William H. Gray III, the fund's president, is to help increase computer access among black college students.
3/16/2000	Corrections	A headline in Business Day yesterday about a licensing agreement between Microsoft and RealNetworks referred to the deal imprecisely. It lets RealNetworks equip its multimedia software to play files in Microsoft's Windows Media Player format; RealNetworks is not licensing the actual Microsoft player software.
3/16/2000	You Want to Be in Pictures? Will You Settle for a Web Page?	WHILE just a few years ago it might have been akin to owning a Lear jet, having your own Web page these days is about as exciting as having your own e-mail address. But if you really want one, whether to show off family photos or to plug a new business, there is plenty of room still available in cyberspace. Internet service providers like America Online, Earthlink, AT&T WorldNet Service and Juno Web offer an easy and fast way to create and publish Web pages. Most offer 5 to 15 megabytes of storage space for the pages they hold on their servers. That is more than enough to accommodate several pages with images and text.
3/15/2000	Microsoft Says It Licensed Its Media Player to a Rival	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had licensed its Windows Media Player technology, without charge, to its main competitor, RealNetworks. Microsoft used the occasion to assert that its digital media effort -- producing software for Internet users to listen to audio and watch video -- is moving ahead rapidly.
3/14/2000	Microsoft Project With Consultant	Microsoft and Andersen Consulting said yesterday that they were creating a joint venture to promote and sell Microsoft's Windows 2000 business software. Microsoft will contribute $385 million in cash to the project. The venture, to be called Avanade, could eventually issue its own stock, the companies said, and is valued at $1 billion.
3/14/2000	Microsoft to Back a Browser Keyword System	The Microsoft Corporation is expected to announce Tuesday that it is throwing its considerable weight behind a keyword system that aims to enable Internet users to navigate the Web without typing in the cumbersome addresses known as U.R.L.'s. The technology, developed by RealNames Corporation of Redwood City, Calif., allows Web users to type in the name of a company or product -- without the usual ''www.'' precede and ''.com'' suffix -- and zip directly to the site of the entity that has paid RealNames to lock up that keyword.
3/10/2000	Microsoft Plans to Try Its Hand At Machines for Video Games	In an ambitious step beyond its stronghold in personal computing, the Microsoft Corporation is announcing plans today to challenge Sony, Nintendo and Sega with a video game machine called the X-Box. At an industry conference in San Jose, Calif., William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, will sketch out his company's plans to capture a sizable share of the $20 billion-a-year worldwide video game market.
3/9/2000	New Venture Looks Beyond The PC Era	A group of former executives from the Microsoft Corporation are expected to announce today the creation of a holding company to invest in and nurture start-ups focused on what has been called the ''post-PC world,'' a time when the personal computer and Microsoft no longer dominate the technology markets. The chairman and chief executive of the new venture, the Ignition Corporation, is Brad Silverberg, 45, a former senior executive at Microsoft who guided the company's catch-up strategy to embrace the Internet. He is being joined by seven former Microsoft managers who were part of that campaign, including Cameron Myhrvold, John Ludwig and Jonathan Roberts.
3/8/2000	Microsoft Quits Trade Group After Dispute Over U.S. Case	The Microsoft Corporation quit the nation's oldest and largest software industry trade association yesterday after a long-running dispute over the group's support for the government in the Microsoft antitrust case. The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly known as the Software Publishers Association, filed a friend-of-the-court brief last month on behalf of the Justice Department, arguing that Microsoft had a monopoly in personal computer operating systems and used it to expand its market power.
3/7/2000	Gauging the Limits of Quantum Computing	Six years ago, Dr. Peter Shor, a researcher at AT&T Labs, galvanized an obscure area of computer science when he published a recipe by which a computer based on the principles of quantum mechanics could break the cryptographic codes protecting data transmissions over the Internet. Since then, top researchers around the world have joined forces to further explore how the power of the strange rules that prevail in the submicroscopic realm of the atom can be harnessed in a computer.
2/28/2000	Confronting the Reality Of a Health Care Vision	It is show-me time for Healtheon/ WebMD. The Internet-based company has riveted investors the last year, as its stock price rode a roller coaster while Healtheon announced a dizzying array of mergers and alliances. This month alone, Healtheon has used its stock in $5.7 billion worth of takeover deals for three companies.
2/28/2000	Serious About Research, Microsoft Makes Time for a Game	When Rick Rashid, Microsoft's vice president for research, utters, ''Set your phasers to stun,'' he isn't preparing to begin one of his company's famous take-no-prisoners assaults on some hapless competitor. A soft-spoken expert in operating systems design, Mr. Rashid joined the company nine years ago when Microsoft's chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold, set about to create a world-class advanced research laboratory.
2/28/2000	A Business Stunt Misses The Mark	Sun Microsystems' chairman, Scott McNealy, is well known for his merciless teasing of William H. Gates and Microsoft. (Mr. McNealy likes to point out, for instance, that while both he and Mr. Gates attended Harvard, only Mr. McNealy graduated.) But one recent attempted prank against Microsoft appears to have fallen short.
2/28/2000	McCain Opposes Tax Breaks Important in Washington State	Two days before the Republican primary in Washington State, Senator John McCain said today that he opposed a tax provision that has saved some of that state's largest employers, including the Boeing Corporation and Microsoft, hundreds of millions of dollars each year. During an appearance this morning on ABC's ''This Week,'' Mr. McCain was asked if he supported a recent ruling by the World Trade Organization to eliminate foreign sales corporations, the off-shore subsidiaries that many United States companies set up to channel overseas sales through places like the Virgin Islands.
2/25/2000	Broker Site Is Disrupted In New Attack On Internet	NDB, an online broker, was cut off for more than an hour yesterday because of what it said was an attack by computer vandals that was similar to those against several prominent Web sites earlier this month. In addition, Microsoft said yesterday that it had come under attack this week. Adam Sohn, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the effect of the two-hour assault on Tuesday morning was limited, making the site inaccessible to no more than 10 percent of its potential visitors.
2/24/2000	Honeywell Is Expanding Its Presence on the Web	Chalk up another distinction between Honeywell, the $8 billion instruments and controls company, and Honeywell, the $24 billion diversified manufacturer that was formed when it merged with AlliedSignal. The old Honeywell had a Web site, operating since July, called MyPlant.com. It was a forum for plant managers, engineers and other operations people to exchange ideas, use Honeywell software to simulate their processes, buy Honeywell products and even view banner ads from other manufacturers. All of it was free, even the ads. And Honeywell ran the site alone.
2/23/2000	MICROSOFT CHIDED AS ANTITRUST TRIAL DRAWS TO A CLOSE	Microsoft had its last chance in federal court today to persuade the trial judge not to issue a stinging antitrust verdict against the company. But the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, gave Microsoft little comfort. At one point in today's final arguments, he dismissed a crucial Microsoft defense by comparing the company to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly, the subject of the first major antitrust case, in 1906. That case resulted in a breakup of the company.
2/23/2000	Buffett Reluctantly Discloses Berkshire Stake in Microsoft	Warren E. Buffett has reported holding stakes in the Microsoft Corporation and several other companies after the Securities and Exchange Commission refused to let Mr. Buffett, a renowned billionaire investor, delay disclosure of these holdings. Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the Omaha company controlled by Mr. Buffett, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it held 167,500 preferred shares issued by Microsoft as of Sept. 30, 1999. Microsoft first sold the convertible preferred stock in December 1996.
2/22/2000	COUNTERFEIT SOFTWARE SEIZED	Scores of counterfeit copies of Windows 2000 were seized by Israeli police from street vendors Sunday, a day before the software's official release. The raid was seen as a response to a recommendation in Washington by the International Intellectual Property Alliance, a software and entertainment industry lobbying group, that Israel be placed on a United States government priority list of countries facing trade sanctions for the illegal copying of compact discs.

2/21/2000	Building an Alternative to Windows	The Beatles never got back together, but four members of the original Apple Macintosh team are regrouping. And they mean to take the best of the quirky Apple computer and move it to the world of Linux software. Andy Hertzfeld, Mike Boich, Susan Kare and Guy Tribble are busy trying to recreate the innovative tone originally set by Apple Computer's founder, Steven Jobs, when he led a band of renegades to design the Macintosh in the early 1980's.
2/20/2000	The Way We Live Now: 2-20-00: The Ethicist; Milking Mr. Softee	Microsoft recently offered a $400 rebate if you bought a computer and subscribed to its online service. To comply with a state law, the company allowed California consumers to cancel the service at any time. Many people took the rebate, canceled the service and pocketed $400. Since Microsoft must have anticipated this, is it unethical? / K.J., Mountain View, Calif. If you signed up for Microsoft's online service intending to use it, but then canceled because you were dissatisfied, enjoy your $400. But if you signed up only to cadge a rebate, never intending to use the service, then you have behaved badly. That Microsoft anticipated this sort of thing doesn't alter the equation. Banks anticipate getting robbed, and so they install big, heavy vaults: that doesn't make robbery acceptable. Foreseeing crime, I stuff mousetraps into my pockets, but that doesn't make pickpocketing O.K., and now I stink of cheese.
2/17/2000	For Home Users, No Need To Rush Out for Windows 2000	Most home computer users can safely ignore Windows 2000, which goes on sale today as the newest version of the Microsoft Corporation's flagship operating system software. Windows 2000 is designed mainly for large corporations and network-intensive businesses. Even Microsoft concedes that it is not designed for the majority of individual PC users. Windows 2000 does have features that could appeal to small businesses and even some portable computer users. It is less likely to crash than the Windows NT software it replaces and is much more stable than Windows 98. But that is partly because it does not even attempt to work with the wide variety of common software applications and peripheral devices that most home PC users have installed on their Windows 98 systems.
2/17/2000	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday about the sale of an equity stake in the Zagat Survey to a group of outside investors misstated the affiliation of one investor, Nathan Myhrvold. He is on leave from Microsoft, where he was chief technology officer. He was not a founder of Microsoft.
2/16/2000	CHECKFREE HOLDINGS BUYING A RIVAL, TRANSPOINT	The CheckFree Holdings Corporation, which lets consumers pay bills online, agreed yesterday to pay $1 billion in stock for its closely held rival TransPoint, a joint venture of the First Data Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation. CheckFree said it would exchange 17 million shares for TransPoint, giving First Data, Microsoft and a TransPoint investor, Citigroup Inc., a combined 23 percent stake in CheckFree. The three companies agreed to pay CheckFree, which is also backed by Intuit Inc., $100 million in cash when the transaction is completed. CheckFree is looking to lock up a dominant position in electronic bill payment. The deal for TransPoint was announced after the close of trading yesterday; shares of CheckFree fell $1.875, to $68.25.
2/16/2000	Who's the Boss? Who's a Worker?	Last year, a group of temporary employees at ARCO sued the oil company, arguing that they were really full-time workers who deserved better benefits. Last month, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration touched off a firestorm of protest from Republicans and business executives by seeming to suggest that all home offices would be subject to ergonomic inspections.
2/14/2000	Looking for a New Life in Linux	Can two losers from the Windows world marry and find happiness -- or at least better sales -- in the Linux world? It may seem like a long shot, but that is the bet the Corel Corporation appears to have made in announcing last week that it will merge with the Inprise/Borland Corporation. Corel's primary product is WordPerfect Office, a suite of productivity applications, including word processing, spreadsheet and database, that runs a very distant second in the market to Microsoft Office. Corel actually acquired most of the parts of its suite from Novell Inc., which had bought some of them from Borland before Borland withdrew from the Windows application market to concentrate on software development tools under the Inprise name.
2/14/2000	Microsoft Facing a Skeptical Market With Windows 2000	Will the dogs eat the dog food? It is a way of wondering whether the customers will accept the product. And among the elite corps of Microsoft programmers who labor to turn out each new operating system, the dog food aphorism has become a way of life.
2/13/2000	Again, It's Microsoft vs. the World	STEVEN BALLMER, the president of the Microsoft Corporation, returned again and again to a single question. ''What is the soul of MSN?'' he asked, referring to Microsoft's consumer Internet business by its three-letter logo. A pressing question indeed for the 70 Microsoft managers summoned last June to Building No. 27 here for a searching review of the business. They had come from ''Red West,'' a cluster of five buildings more than a mile from the main corporate campus and home to MSN Web sites like Expedia, Carpoint and MoneyCentral, and the MSN online service. Even within Microsoft, it was derided -- dubbed ''Red Vest,'' a place to hide from real work while waiting for one's lucrative stock options to vest. Outside Microsoft, it was regarded as a laboratory of failure, called ''Red Ink West,'' running up losses of as much as $1.5 billion since 1995, much of it squandered on a wayward effort to become a production studio for new media.
2/10/2000	EUROPEAN INQUIRY ON WINDOWS 2000	Opening a new line of investigation into the business practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the European Commission has begun an inquiry into Windows 2000, the new operating system scheduled to go on sale on Feb. 17. The commission said other software companies had complained that the new system could help Microsoft extend its dominance from personal computer software to the systems that run servers and manage electronic commerce. Microsoft said that it would provide the information by the start of March but that the investigation would not delay Windows 2000's introduction. Edmund L. Andrews
2/7/2000	Virtual Publishing: From Arthur Clarke To Psoriasis Tales	The demand for Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel about a malevolent computer named HAL has endured for three decades, but interest was rather tepid for the author's six-page, double-spaced essay about ''TV's Time-Travel Future.'' So last month the British author of ''2001 -- A Space Odyssey'' plunged into the infant market for electronic books -- ignoring the risk to his prestige. He posted his November speech to a United Nations conference for a four-figure advance paid by an Internet newcomer with an irreverent name and approach, Fatbrain.com.
2/6/2000	A View That Needs No Windows	LIKE Bill Gates and Michael Dell, Larry Augustin spent his spare time in college toying with computers and wound up starting a company that made him a zillionaire. But unlike them, Mr. Augustin earned a college degree, at Notre Dame, and later a doctorate, at Stanford. And so he comes across as less the entrepreneur from birth than the nerd's nerd, never happier than when up to his eyes in bits and bytes and the esoterica of hardware and software. He proudly asserts that he was a charter subscriber to Sys Admin, a trade magazine devoted to systems administrators, the unsung heroes who keep computer systems running. ''I've been a systems administrator for every operating system created in the last 20 years,'' he said.
2/3/2000	The Case of the Flickering Pixels	IF anyone should know how hard it is to read from a computer screen, it is Dr. James Sheedy. A clinical professor of optometry at the University of California at Berkeley and founder of its Computer Eye Clinic, Dr. Sheedy has treated patients with computer-related eye strain for nearly 15 years. So what does Dr. Sheedy do when he is faced with reading a jumbo-size e-mail? ''If I have to read something longer than three or four pages, I prefer to print it out,'' he said. ''What we're dealing with on our computer screens doesn't approach the quality of paper.''
2/2/2000	Filing Offers a Way to Find Microsoft Violated the Law	A Harvard legal scholar told the judge in the Microsoft antitrust case yesterday that the company's decision to bundle its Web browser into the Windows operating system had ''obvious benefits'' to computer programmers and consumers. But he then proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining that the bundling strategy violated the law. The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue -- how antitrust law on product ''tying'' should apply to the case. The intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will probably provide both sides with some legal ammunition.
2/1/2000	Group Files a Brief Supporting Microsoft	Microsoft gained some prominent allies in its antitrust fight yesterday, as two former United States attorneys general and a pair of former senior White House lawyers supported the company's defense in a court filing. They wrote a friend-of-the court brief submitted by the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group with close ties to the Microsoft Corporation and founded in 1998 when the government filed its antitrust suit against the company.
2/1/2000	EXPEDIA INC. AGREES TO BUY TWO TRAVEL WEB SITES	Expedia Inc., the online travel company controlled by the Microsoft Corporation, agreed yesterday to buy Travelscape.com Inc. and VacationSpot.com Inc., for about $161 million in stock and assumed debt, gaining Web sites that specialize in renting hotel rooms and vacation homes. Expedia, based in Bellevue, Wash., said it would issue about 2.6 million shares and stock options, worth $70.9 million, for VacationSpot.com. It will issue three million shares, options and warrants, worth about $81.8 million, for Travelscape.com. It will also assume $8 million in debt.
1/31/2000	E-Commerce Report; Wary of hackers and the courts, e-mail users are turning to services that keep their messages secure.	MICROSOFT would not be proud to admit it, but the software behemoth has done more to spur the growth of the e-mail security industry the last two years than perhaps any other company. Businesspeople blanched at the notion that Bill Gates, of all people, could be forced to answer questions in court about e-mail messages that he had sent years before -- supposedly in confidence. Meanwhile, consumers took note last summer when hackers broke into Microsoft's Hotmail site and made public some highly embarrassing personal correspondence by its users.
1/29/2000	WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING -- AMERICAS; MEXICO INTERNET VENTURE	Telefonos de Mexico and Microsoft Corp to begin offering Internet gateway service for Mexico (S)
1/27/2000	What Are They Saying?	To the Editor: Microsoft's newest television advertisement uses the musical theme of the ''Confutatis Maledictis'' from Mozart's Requiem. ''Where do you want to go today?'' is the cheery line on the screen. Meanwhile, the chorus sings, ''Confutatis maledictis, flammis acribus addictis,'' which translates to, ''The damned and accursed are convicted to flames of hell.'' ROSALIE SENNETT New York
1/27/2000	Sun Plans to Start Shipping Operating System Next Month	Moving to maintain its hold on the Internet, Sun Microsystems Inc. said today that Solaris 8, the latest version of its operating system, would ship on Feb. 28. Sun's announcement comes as the Microsoft Corporation prepares to ship Windows 2000, its strongest challenge yet to Sun's domination of high-powered server computers for delivering Internet services, on Feb. 17. Windows 2000, the latest version of Windows NT, Microsoft's operating system for corporate networks, is meant to answer criticism that NT is not robust, secure or reliable enough for the demands of World Wide Web servers.
1/26/2000	U.S. and 19 States Issue Stinging Reply to Microsoft	Despite fresh signs that the plaintiffs have not yet agreed on what sanction to seek against Microsoft, they jointly issued a stinging and disdainful rebuttal yesterday to the company's legal arguments last week that it had not violated the nation's antitrust laws. In a 30-page document filed with Federal District Court in Washington, the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company characterized its arguments as a strained effort at knocking down legal ''straw men'' and an attempt to ''apply to this case out-of-context passages from decisions involving patently different market circumstances.''
1/25/2000	$5 Billion Puts Gates Fund In First Place	The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said yesterday that William H. Gates, the founder of the Microsoft Corporation, and his wife, Melinda, have donated an additional $5 billion to their philanthropic foundation, making it the world's wealthiest, with assets of $21.8 billion. With the gift, the foundation passed the Wellcome Trust in Britain, which has assets of $21.4 billion, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a publication that covers nonprofit organizations and ranks them by the size of their assets. The second-largest foundation in the United States is the Ford Foundation, with assets of $13.1 billion.
1/24/2000	Microsoft Makes Another Interactive TV Investment	In another step toward extending its reach from the personal computer to the television set, the Microsoft Corporation will invest $56 million in Intertainer Inc., a privately held company that provides a video-on-demand service, Microsoft executives said. The deal, which was expected to be formally announced Monday, would give Microsoft a stake of slightly more than 20 percent in Intertainer, making it the largest single shareholder.
1/23/2000	Of Companies and Countries	To the Editor: ''A Company Worth More Than Spain?'' (Market Watch, Dec. 26) noted how Microsoft's market value was about equal to Spain's gross domestic product.
1/19/2000	Microsoft Issues Lengthy Response to Judge in Antitrust Case	Sailing against a fierce head wind, Microsoft delivered the legal arguments today that it hoped would stave off an adverse antitrust ruling, taking issue with a judge's conclusions about the case and restating many arguments that he had already rejected. Microsoft's 70-page conclusions of law, sent to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and published on its Web site after the stock market closed, contend that case law does not support either the government's charges or the judge's findings of fact, published in November. The filing does not, however, directly assail Judge Jackson.
1/19/2000	Microsoft's Quarterly Earnings Exceed Expectations	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations, but was punished by after-hours traders for having missed more optimistic ''whisper numbers.'' While sounding its usual cautionary notes about corporate PC demand and slowing revenue growth, Microsoft reported solid results amid a sea of recent distractions, including last week's news of the merger of Time Warner and America Online, the passing of the chief executive title from William H. Gates to Steven Ballmer and yesterday's filing challenging the findings of a federal judge that the company is an abusive monopoly.
1/17/2000	Industry View; The inspiration, crazy excitement -- and job volatility -- of an Internet start-up venture.	GASP. That's the first thing I did when I heard the AOL-Time Warner news last Monday. The second thing I did was flash back to February 1995, when I surfed the World Wide Web for the first time. I was working as the nebulously titled ''director of content development'' for Delphi Internet, a tiny online company that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation had just bought. Within a few months, the News Corporation entered into a joint venture with MCI -- a union that, like the proposed acquisition by America Online of Time Warner, was described by the parties as the perfect strategic fit.
1/17/2000	Linux Vendor Set to Get $57 Million Infusion	TurboLinux Inc., a Linux operating system vendor with roots in the Asian computer market, will receive a $57 million investment on Monday from Dell Computer, Compaq Computer, Intel and a variety of other United States computer, software and investment firms. Linux, which is a version of the Unix operating system, is seen as a growing threat to Microsoft and other proprietary operating system vendors, particularly in Internet-related markets. It was developed on a volunteer basis by a worldwide group of dedicated programmers.
1/16/2000	Reckonings; Master of the Game	So Bill Gates is stepping down -- or up, or sideways, or something -- from his position as C.E.O. of Microsoft. Nobody seems to think that this will make much difference either to the way Microsoft is run or to the desire of the Justice Department to break up the world's most valuable company and humble its founder. But maybe the announcement provides a good occasion to reflect on the achievements of this elder statesman (44 years old!) of the New Economy. You might say that Mr. Gates is to business strategy what Heinz Guderian, the father of the blitzkrieg, was to military strategy. Germany didn't invent the tank or the bomber; but the German command understood, in a way that the British or the French did not, how these inventions changed the nature of war, and very nearly ended up conquering the world. Microsoft didn't invent either the personal computer or the point-and-click interface; but Mr. Gates understood, in a way that other contenders for empire did not, how these inventions changed the nature of business competition, and some think that he has come equally close to global conquest.
1/15/2000	Microsoft's Chief Settles Into His Best Friend's Old Job	At the lectern on his first day as chief executive of the world's most powerful software company, Steven A. Ballmer slapped his hands together loudly for emphasis. But only once. By any account, such a performance is low key for Mr. Ballmer, who on Thursday was named to succeed his longtime business partner and best friend, William H. Gates, as Microsoft's chief executive. Mr. Gates will remain the company's chairman and focus on shaping Microsoft's software strategy.
1/14/2000	Little Progress Is Reported in Antitrust Talks	Microsoft's top executives said today that they were still hopeful of settling the government antitrust case against the company before a federal judge issues his final ruling. And they said company officials had had far-reaching internal discussions about their options. ''We have had some amazing discussions and wild ideas about what we would do,'' Steven A. Ballmer, the company's president, said in an interview.
1/14/2000	G.E. Joining Effort on 'Smart' Appliances	The General Electric Company, the No. 1 maker of appliances for new homes in the United States, said it had agreed to develop standards with the Microsoft Corporation to connect so-called smart appliances with other consumer devices. G.E. said it would join Microsoft's Universal Plug and Play Forum, which includes Sony, International Business Machines and Intel. G.E. has a similar agreement with a Microsoft rival, Sun Microsystems Inc., among others.
1/14/2000	Microsoft Names a New Chief Executive	William H. Gates stepped aside today as chief executive of Microsoft after a quarter-century of running the company day to day and gave that role to his longtime partner Steven A. Ballmer, the company's president. Mr. Gates will remain as chairman and said he would take on a new role as ''chief software architect,'' declaring his conviction that ''in the revolution ahead of us, software will be at the center.''
1/13/2000	Technology Consulting Firm Calls for Dismantling of Microsoft	A leading technology consulting and research company says that Microsoft, to resolve its antitrust case with the government, should pre-emptively break itself up into four or five companies. In a special report to its customers, the International Data Corporation, an independent research company with most of the world's major technology companies as clients, concluded in a special bulletin issued last month that a breakup of the company would be ''the best outcome for consumers, for the industry and for Microsoft.''
1/13/2000	COMPANIES TO INVEST IN INTERMEDIA AND ITS DIGEX WEB UNIT	Intermedia Communications Inc. is getting $300 million in investments from the Microsoft Corporation, the Compaq Computer Corporation and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company to help it expand its telephone and Web services. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, and Compaq, the biggest computer maker, will each buy a $50 million stake in Intermedia's 81 percent-owned Digex unit, which manages Web sites for other companies. Kohlberg Kravis, the No. 1 buyout firm, will invest $200 million for an Intermedia stake of about 8 percent. The agreement gives Digex access to Compaq's servers for its data centers and Microsoft software to run the sites. Intermedia's shares rose $1.75 each, to $40, in Nasdaq trading. Digex climbed $3.9375 a share, to $69.50, on the Nasdaq stock market.
1/12/2000	Merger May Produce the Rival Microsoft Has Always Dreaded	To the company's adversaries, the very name ''Microsoft'' suggests menacing power. It has been called the Death Star, an 800-pound gorilla and far worse. And in the government's sweeping antitrust case, the Microsoft Corporation was portrayed in convincing detail as a monopolistic bully. America Online Inc., in particular, was bent to Microsoft's will, according to court testimony.
1/11/2000	Microsoft and Caldera Settle Antitrust Suit	Caldera Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation announced today that they had settled a suit that had accused Microsoft of anticompetitive practices. Under the terms of the settlement, Microsoft will pay Caldera an undisclosed sum. Microsoft said it would record a one-time charge of about 3 cents a share against earnings in the quarter ended March 31. That would total at least $154 million based on the number of outstanding shares, and the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher.
1/11/2000	When Everything New Becomes Dizzingly Newer	The combination of America Online and Time Warner would create a colossus that could force competitors from the Walt Disney Company to AT&T to Microsoft to reconsider their strategies. The deal, announced yesterday, leaves Disney, the News Corporation, Seagram, NBC, Viacom-CBS and other, smaller old-media companies with a stark choice. They can try to carve a future alone on the Internet, a place that has so far been inhospitable to old-media companies. Or they can merge with new- media companies like Yahoo, putting their future in the hands of businesses that hardly existed five years ago.
1/2/2000	Siblings, and a Rivalry	Gregory Maffei's resignation as chief financial officer of Microsoft won't extricate him from a legal tangle that has put his interests at odds with those of his sister, Anne. Though he is leaving Microsoft to become chief executive of Worldwide Fiber, Mr. Maffei, 39, will remain as non-executive chairman of Expedia, an electronic travel service that Microsoft spun off in November. Ms. Maffei, 32, went to work last summer as an executive with Priceline WebHouse Club, an online grocery-shopping service affiliated with Priceline.com.
12/31/1999	With a Whole Lot at Stake, I.B.M. and Microsoft Await Year 2000	At the Microsoft Corporation, the price of freedom on New Year's Eve is high indeed -- more than $60 billion, by one reckoning. Which is another way of saying that Steven Ballmer, the president (personal worth: $28 billion), will be working, but William H. Gates, the chairman (personal worth: $91 billion), has the night off. At the International Business Machines Corporation, none of the senior executives have the night off. Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman, and the other dozen members of his executive team will be on the job monitoring the Year 2000 transition of the world's computer systems past midnight.
12/30/1999	RealNetworks Suit Defends Its Copyright on Audio Files	In what could be a precedent-setting case in Internet copyright law, RealNetworks Inc., whose products deliver audio and video content over the Web, is suing a company that makes software that converts RealNetworks' products into the format marketed by its rival, the Microsoft Corporation. RealNetworks' suit accuses the company, Streambox Inc., of violating several laws intended to protect intellectual property, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The suit is based on a part of the act largely untested since it was enacted in October 1998.
12/30/1999	WebTV Puts It All Together	A COUPLE of years ago, one word buzzed around practically any gathering of the engineers and designers responsible for the latest gee-whiz advances in personal computers, televisions, videocassette recorders and just about anything else that could be plugged in or tuned in. That word was ''convergence.''
12/27/1999	After Shaky Starts, News Organizations Gain Confidence on Web	Minutes after The Seattle Times disclosed on Dec. 17 that a man with the makings of a fertilizer bomb in his car trunk had been arrested in Port Angeles, Wash., news sites across the World Wide Web were sprinting to deliver details. But no other site gave the Port Angeles arrest a showcase to match MSNBC.com, the news Web site that for the last year has consistently commanded the largest audience. A picture of the Seattle space needle dominated the home page, overlaid with the headline ''Y2K Plot?'' In slightly smaller type were the words ''NBC News: Officials fear suspect was part of plan to bomb Seattle.'' A report by NBC correspondents popped up with links to the Web site of NBC's Seattle affiliate, KING-TV. Another link took the reader to a video report by an NBC correspondent. Another led to a map showing where, according to law-enforcement authorities, the suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been active.
12/26/1999	High-Tech Industry, Long Shy of Politics, Is Now Belle of Ball	At a time when Congress is bitterly divided and unable to reach consensus on issues like gun control and health care, Democrats and Republicans are happily reaching across party lines to pass legislation backed by high-tech companies. The high-tech industry, at the same moment, is lavishing new attention on Washington and changing its once-aloof posture toward the federal government.
12/23/1999	Microsoft Unveils Tax Product But Bill Gates Can't Use It	What do you give a man with everything? Why, tax software, of course. Microsoft's TaxSaver software started arriving in stores this week, joining a crowded tax software market dominated by Intuit's TurboTax product line. Microsoft joined with the accounting giant Arthur Andersen to produce the package. ''Microsoft has been talking about a tax product for years,'' said Laura Starita, an analyst at the Gartner Group, ''but it's extremely cumbersome and not a fun business to be in.''
12/23/1999	Microsoft's Finance Chief Resigns Post	Microsoft's chief financial officer, Gregory Maffei, resigned yesterday to join a Canadian builder of high-speed telecommunications networks, becoming the latest Microsoft executive to depart for entrepreneurial opportunities elsewhere. Mr. Maffei, 39, will become the chief executive of Worldwide Fiber of Vancouver, British Columbia, a private company that is aggressively building a fiber optic network in North America and across the Atlantic Ocean. Such high-speed networks are seen as increasingly valuable assets as Internet traffic and data communications surge.
12/21/1999	Microsoft Objects to an Analyst In U.S. Antitrust Case Against It	The Microsoft Corporation has officially objected to the selection of a Harvard law professor to write an analysis of antitrust law in the government's antitrust case against the software maker, contending that the professor is biased. In a brief filed earlier this month, Microsoft said that the professor, Lawrence Lessig, ''may not be an impartial friend of the court with regard to legal issues in the case.''
12/21/1999	Adviser to U.S. on Microsoft Likes to Avoid the Limelight	After 10 minutes with Robert F. Greenhill, a longtime Wall Street deal maker, it is clear why the Justice Department hired him to advise it on its negotiations with Microsoft. Ask about his 20-year friendship with Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Citigroup and frequent dinner companion, and his answer is a firm ''No comment.'' Question his role in some of this decade's largest corporate takeovers, like Viacom's bid for Paramount Communications or the restructuring of I.B.M., and he says, ''I won't talk about that.'' And when queried about what it was like to run not one, but two, Wall Street firms, he dodges the question: ''You don't really want to know, do you?''
12/18/1999	High-Tech Hanukkah Gift Attracts Detectives	When Samuel Posner opened the Hanukkah gift from his son, the black, high-tech gizmo seemed like any other pricey new toy. Not quite. The gift, which resembled a videocassette recorder, contained top-secret technology designed by the Microsoft Corporation, potentially worth $1 million, the police said.
12/17/1999	As Sales Boom Online, Some Customers Boo; Beam Us Down to Earth, Scotty: E-tailers Rush to Form Alliances With More Traditional Retailers	Electronic commerce, explosive as it is, clearly cannot keep growing by going solo. Convinced that they cannot grab the next generation of Web users without each other, Internet companies and the biggest earthbound retailers have buried the hatchet and are rushing to do business together. In the latest such partnerships, Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, and Best Buy, the nation's largest electronics merchant, both announced far-reaching alliances with Internet companies yesterday.
12/16/1999	Technology as the Guiding Hand of History	SOME people see history as a set of names, dates and points on a map. Other people see it as the evolution of ideas that drive society: science, religion and politics. In Age of Empires 2, a computer strategy game published by Microsoft, the grand sweep of human events is expressed as a series of technological upgrades. Picking up where the original ended, with the fall of Rome, the game takes place over a thousand years, leading up to the Renaissance, as civilizations race to replace their hardware and software with more elaborate versions, at considerable cost. In this respect, Age of Empires 2 is typical of the real-time strategy genre: you begin by foraging, then stockpile resources, undertake construction projects according to Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs (starting with houses, mills and lumber camps, working up to universities and cathedrals), explore, create and train an army, and vanquish computer-generated enemies or online opponents.
12/16/1999	British Cable Television Concern Expected to Disclose Acquisition	Telewest Communications P.L.C., Britain's second-largest cable television company, is expected to announce as early as Thursday that it will acquire Flextech P.L.C., a British TV production concern, for about $:1.9 billion, or $3 billion, executives close to the talks said tonight. If the acquisition proceeds, Telewest, whose biggest shareholders include Microsoft and AT&T's Liberty Media Group, would be able to create a $14.4 billion company that both produces and distributes programming over one cable system. The move is expected to make Telewest more competitive with British Sky Broadcasting Group, the satellite television company that is 40 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and NTL Inc., the acquisition-hungry British cable company that bought the Swiss company Cablecom this week.
12/16/1999	Development Work Finished On Microsoft Windows 2000	Microsoft said yesterday that it had completed the development of its Windows 2000 operating system software. The often-delayed program was sent to manufacturing plants and should reach the public on Feb. 17. Windows 2000 is the successor to Windows NT, the operating system Microsoft sells primarily to businesses. A successor to Microsoft's consumer operating system, Windows 98, code-named Millennium, is expected next year, but no date has been set. The programs currently remain separate, but Microsoft executives yesterday reiterated their intention to merge the code.
12/15/1999	Help E-Commerce Grow	To the Editor: A Nov. 30 letter about the policies of the World Trade Organization and positions taken by Microsoft stated that the W.T.O. seeks to ''make Internet commerce tax-free.'' In fact, the W.T.O. has only a moratorium on tariffs for transmissions over the Internet. But it has taken no position on taxes, like sales or value-added taxes, relating to online purchases.
12/12/1999	A Spoonful of Sugar For Microsoft's Bitter Pill	A Spoonful of Sugar For Microsoft's Bitter Pill HERE was a second round of secrecy-cloaked settlement talks between Microsoft and the Government last week in Chicago. The only sure thing about these meetings, presided over by Richard A. Posner, a Federal appeals court judge, is that they are hardly social gatherings; there is no love lost, and a common ground for compromise will not be easy to find. Microsoft will not voluntarily agree to the harsher sanctions being considered by the Justice Department and 19 states -- a breakup of the company or forced licensing of the programming code for Windows -- unless Judge Posner proves to be a sorcerer instead of a mediator. And the government will not accept a sin-no-more solution in which Microsoft signs a settlement that prohibits certain kinds of conduct or contracts.
12/12/1999	The Way We Live Now: 12-12-99: Word & Image; How to Bust His Trust	The judicial finding that Microsoft has attained, enjoyed and abused the power of a monopoly reached me at a fortuitous moment. I instantly knew what punishment fit the crime. Just a few hours earlier, I had been reading about the tycoon known for ''his visionary leadership, his courageous persistence, his capacity to think in strategic terms, but also his lust for domination, his messianic self-righteousness and his contempt for those shortsighted mortals who made the mistake of standing in his way.''
12/9/1999	Microsoft and Ericsson To Create Wireless Venture	Ericsson of Sweden and the Microsoft Corporation will create a joint-venture company to market and deliver mobile e-mail and other Internet services for wireless network operators, the companies said yesterday. Ericsson, the world's third largest mobile phone maker, will own a majority of the new venture. Under the terms of the deal, Ericsson will provide its Wireless Application Protocol to Microsoft and will adopt Microsoft's Mobile Explorer, a new version of its Internet browser, in future cellular phones. Ericsson officials said the partnership did not mean that the company would use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system in its wireless devices at this time, although they did not rule anything out. Microsoft said it expected to start shipping Mobile Explorer in the middle of next year.
12/3/1999	U.S. Hires Advisory Firm in Microsoft Case	The Justice Department said this evening that it had hired New York investment bankers to help determine the financial impact of various proposals for restructuring Microsoft or changing its business practices to resolve the antitrust case against the company. The department said the investment firm Greenhill & Company would ''assist the division in analyzing financial aspects of the full range of potential remedies in U.S. v. Microsoft, including conduct and structural relief.''
12/1/1999	Lawyers in Microsoft Case Meet in Chicago	Lawyers for the Microsoft Corporation, the federal government and 19 states met for about two hours today with a federal judge appointed to seek a settlement in the antitrust case against the software maker. Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, talked privately with William Neukom, Microsoft's in-house counsel, and David Boies, the Justice Department's chief trial lawyer in the case. They declined comment as they entered a private club in Chicago for the meeting.
11/30/1999	Corrections	An article in Circuits on Thursday about the Windows CE operating system misspelled the name of a pocket-size personal organizer made by Casio Inc. that uses the system. It is the Cassiopeia, not Casiopeia.
11/29/1999	Compressed Data; Internet Law Expert Returns to Antitrust Case	He's back. Lawrence Lessig, a 38-year-old Harvard professor and Internet law expert, has been recruited for the Microsoft antitrust case once again. When Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson prodded the two sides toward settlement talks and appointed a mediator on Nov. 18, he also said he wanted Mr. Lessig to write a friend-of-the-court brief on his behalf on the issue of technological tying.
11/27/1999	Microsoft on the Defense, Again	To the Editor: A class-action lawsuit filed in California is seeking evidence that would verify that consumers were hurt by Microsoft's prices (front page, Nov. 22). Microsoft's Windows package has helped ordinary consumers by making computing fun and easy. It has also removed the burden of installing, maintaining and learning various software programs. The product is certainly worth more than the price.

11/27/1999	Microsoft on the Defense, Again	To the Editor: Re ''A Microsoft Suit With a Sure Winner'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 23): The twin strands of the whip that drives corporate behavior are profit and the threat of litigation. Companies only face the sting of the whip when they violate the standards of society as codified by the laws that we enact.
11/26/1999	The Microsoft Referee	Neither Microsoft nor the Justice Department appears ready to negotiate an out-of-court settlement of the government's antitrust charges. But Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial judge whose initial ruling three weeks ago labeled Microsoft a bullying monopolist, wants a quick settlement anyway. Last week he made an artful move to get one, appointing one of the country's leading antitrust experts, Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge, to serve as mediator for renewed settlement talks. Judge Posner has a rare qualification. He strikes fear in the hearts of both sides of this epic battle -- enough fear, perhaps, to compel them to compromise. Judge Posner is an intellectual leader of a conservative brand of jurisprudence associated with the University of Chicago. Justice officials will note with some alarm that his writings on antitrust caution against aggressive remedies, pointing out that government-imposed breakups of monopolies often backfire. Judge Posner's credentials will also give him the credibility to warn government negotiators that they risk defeat if they do not settle soon. Based on Judge Jackson's initial ruling, Microsoft is almost certain to lose the first round. It will then appeal. The appeals court includes prominent conservative justices who, Judge Posner can explain, may be more hostile to the government's case than Judge Jackson.
11/25/1999	First Talks Are Scheduled by Mediator in Microsoft Case	The government and Microsoft have been summoned to Chicago on Tuesday for their first round of settlement talks under Richard A. Posner, the federal appeals court judge who has been selected as a mediator, according to a person close to the antitrust case. The mediation talks themselves, under court rules, are secret deliberations. Besides Judge Posner, chief of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, the meeting will include lawyers representing Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company.
11/25/1999	Why Doesn't Windows CE Get Any Respect?; When It Comes to Personal Organizers, Microsoft's Minisystem Does Not Rule the Market	YOU wouldn't expect to find a better spokesman for the Philips Nino than Blake Patterson. If you visit the Philips Electronics Web site, you see a prominent link to a site built by Mr. Patterson, a 27-year-old Web designer from Alexandria, Va. Philips points to Mr. Patterson as a dedicated user of the Nino, the company's palm-size computer. Predictably, Mr. Patterson's site is a veritable shrine to the Nino. The only problem is that Mr. Patterson has not used a Nino, or, for that matter, any device running Windows CE, the simplified version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, for more than six months. Last summer, he soured on CE altogether and after a brief but happy fling with a Palm organizer, became a fervent early convert to the new Visor from Handspring, a startup that has licensed the Palm operating system. Mr. Patterson, who was once paid by Philips to write about the Nino, has not touched his Nino fan page since late last year and it now hangs, petrified, in cyberspace (nino.philips.com/community).
11/25/1999	Corrections	A front-page article on Nov. 10 about prospective remedies being sought by the plaintiffs in the Microsoft antitrust trial omitted a first name and title in some editions for the government official who said he thought Microsoft could live within the law without being broken up. He is Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California.

11/21/1999	The Way We Live Now: 11-21-99: The New Economy; Monopoly Money	Important news about Microsoft the other day -- and, no, I don't mean the verdict declaring it a monopolistic bully. With a bit less fanfare, the company announced that it would be offering users of its Office group of applications online access to the software, anytime, on demand. Between the lines, you might read portents of something bigger: Microsoft morphing from mere seller of software into a sort of global utility, hoping to receive from each of us a monthly check. Practically speaking, online software means no more messy disks to install or lose. But it also means that instead of buying, computer users would rent what Microsoft calls ''the Windows experience and application functionality.''
11/20/1999	MAN IN THE NEWS: Richard A. Posner; Wide-Ranging Legal Thinker	As a federal appeals court judge, Richard A. Posner has an exalted job, but one held by a few hundred others. But to a wide swath of intellectuals, he is one of the most fascinating thinkers in the nation, especially about contemporary American social issues. While most sitting federal judges rarely engage in public comment about subjects outside their courtrooms, Judge Posner has produced more than 30 books on a breathtakingly broad variety of subjects, including sexuality, aging, the economics of AIDS and literary criticism. Most recently, he produced a crisp legal and intellectual analysis of the investigation and impeachment of President Clinton in which he did not shrink from concluding that the president had committed perjury and obstruction of justice.
11/20/1999	Microsoft Case Gets U.S. Judge As a Mediator	The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft antitrust trial named a mediator today in an effort to bring about settlement talks between the Microsoft Corporation and its accusers: the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general. The initiative was wholly that of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, but all sides said they welcomed it.
11/17/1999	U.S. and State Officials Weigh Microsoft Remedies	Sometime in the next two or three months, a diverse alliance of state and federal officials -- some elected, some appointed, some Democrats, some Republicans -- must reach agreement on one of the thorniest public policy issues of the day: what to do with the Microsoft Corporation if, as expected, a federal judge finds the company guilty of violating the nation's antitrust laws. Even the most optimistic among them, Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, places the odds that all of them will agree at only ''something better than 50-50.'' After taking a back seat to the Justice Department for most of the trial, some attorneys general for the 19 states that are co-plaintiffs in the case may no longer be content to let the federal lawyers drive the case solo through the remedies stage.
11/16/1999	MOBILE COMPANY SELLS STAKE	The mobile phone service affiliate of the state-run Korea Telecom Corporation, the Korea Telecom Freetel Company, agreed to sell a 9.2 percent stake to the Microsoft Corporation, Qualcomm Inc. and Capital Communications of Canada for $600 million. The South Korean company said it would sell newly issued shares and bonds with subscription warrants equivalent to a 9.2 percent stake. Under the agreement, Korea Telecom Freetel will venture into the Internet business with Microsoft and jointly develop a code division multiple access system and high-speed wireless data communications technology with Qualcomm. Korea Telecom Freetel will also cooperate with Capital Communications in overseas projects. Samuel Len
11/16/1999	Employees From Microsoft Give Gore an Icy Reception	Vice President Al Gore stepped into the lion's den today, facing down hundreds of Microsoft employees smarting from the judicial finding that their company had bullied its rivals and stifled competition. And he told them just what they did not want to hear: that competition is fundamentally a good thing. With 300 people packing an auditorium on the computer giant's campus, the vice president talked about ''unfair use of market dominance in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector.'' He added, ''If competition is valuable, which I think it is, then antitrust laws have a place in embodying the values of our country.'' And at another point, he said, ''The values that are inherent in the antitrust laws are ones that are sound, in my opinion.''
11/16/1999	Gates Advocates Competition, but He Has His Doubters	As William H. Gates opened his annual speech at the Comdex technology conference, he tried to portray Microsoft as a company that wanted to give consumers choices in how they use computers and get on line. But many of those attending expressed doubts about whether Microsoft was truly embracing the idea of competition. Hundreds of thousands of technology professionals, from software developers to network managers, have descended on this city to attend Comdex, the huge conference that has been showcasing new business computing technologies for 20 years.
11/15/1999	A Microsoft Remedy: Antitrust Experts Offer Prescriptions	Groups of experts from a score of universities nationwide are preparing recommendations for the government as the Justice Department and 19 states prepare for the penalty phase of the Microsoft antitrust trial early next year. If Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson finds Microsoft guilty of antitrust violations -- as his exhaustive findings of fact published nine days ago indicate he will -- a new proceeding will determine what should be done to be sure Microsoft can no longer illegally wield monopoly power.
11/14/1999	Who Depends Most On Microsoft Stock?	The hottest stock of a generation turned into a hot potato last week for the mutual funds that own it. After a federal judge declared that it acts like a monopoly, Microsoft shares fell 2.6 percent last week, to close at $89.1875 on Friday. So, what funds had the largest portions of their portfolios invested in the company? It is difficult to tell, because funds are required to disclose their holdings only when they file their annual or semiannual reports.
11/14/1999	Playing Catch-Up With Monopolies	WHEN President Clinton signed legislation on Friday updating the Depression-era law governing banking, insurance and Wall Street, he was doing little more than allowing Washington to catch up with the sweeping changes that have reshaped the financial services industry over the past few decades. In Congress, the two parties have yet to really address the public outcry over the health care industry's drive to cut costs. While they dithered, the landscape was abruptly altered again last week when one of the nation's largest managed care companies reversed the trend by returning power over treatment choices to doctors.
11/14/1999	Foreign Affairs; The Way We Are	I know it's late, but I've found my Man of the Year. He is Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who just threw the book at Microsoft, handing down a stunning 207-page finding that Bill Gates & Co. had a monopoly over PC operating systems and wielded that monopoly power ''to harm any firm'' that threatened it. People have not paid enough attention to Judge Jackson. He is a dyed-in-the-wool Republican, who was appointed to the federal bench by Ronald Reagan. If you read his bio you would hardly figure him to be a hanging judge for monopolists. Everything in his background suggests that he would be sympathetic to corporate America and Big Business.
11/14/1999	Don't You Sass Me, Mr. Micro-Smartypants!	IN its endless search for further efficiencies, our federal government may wish to consider subcontracting certain of its traditional functions to those modern technologies and individuals better equipped to handle them. The judiciary for example -- long a ponderous, frustrating apparatus -- might be the perfect candidate for this kind of streamlining. Why deny the taxpaying American public a swift, satisfying solution to the issues of the day? Why let complicated, costly legal proceedings drag through the federal courts for years on end when TV's ''Judge Judy'' often gets through two or three cases in half an hour!
11/13/1999	Off the Page and Onto the Screen: An Encyclopedic Mirror of What?	In the early years of this fading millennium, two words often appeared in encyclopedia titles: ''speculum'' (mirror) and ''imago'' (image). Encyclopedias were meant to reflect the world while also giving it shape. And what enormous mirrors they were! One Chinese encyclopedia from the 13th century filled 240 volumes. The German-language General Encyclopedia (1818-89) reached volume 167 and was never even completed. These textual universes were also meant to reflect the divisions and categories of the surrounding world. The 10th-century Arabic encyclopedia, Mafatih al-'Ulum (Key to the Sciences), was split into two sections: indigenous knowledge (including jurisprudence, secretarial duties and history) and foreign knowledge (philosophy, logic, alchemy). One 12th-century European encyclopedia devoted an entire section to a chronicle of events since Satan's fall.
11/12/1999	For Microsoft, the Time May Have Come to Cut a Deal	WITH the facts in, here is the Microsoft debate: One side says that if antitrust laws have any meaning, the conduct described by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson must be illegal. The company used its monopoly in operating systems to force customers to take its Internet browser. It cut prices on its monopoly product for computer makers that agreed to buy its other products.
11/11/1999	Microsoft Shareholders, Mostly, Support Their Chairman	He got a prolonged standing ovation on the way to the podium, and he was mobbed by autograph seekers on the way out. But in between, William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, fielded some questions from his shareholders at the company's annual meeting today that he might not have faced a week ago, questions about whether his legal team had failed him and whether the company might even be broken up in the wake of its antitrust fight with the federal government.
11/11/1999	The Web Without Microsoft	OCCASIONALLY a new product can be annoying and delightful at the same time. Rarely, however, does a delightful product become annoying without any help whatsoever from the Microsoft Corporation, the notorious monopolist. Such is the i-Opener Internet Personal Access Device, or IPAD, one of the first of a new class of Internet appliances from a new company called NetPliance.com. Despite the depiction of Microsoft's practices outlined by the Justice Department and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson last week, NetPliance has managed somehow to create a very interesting home computer that handles e-mail, Web browsing and other simple tasks and yet does not use Windows, Internet Explorer or any other Microsoft code. It uses a version of the Linux operating system.
11/11/1999	Corrections	A front-page article yesterday about the Microsoft Corporation antitrust trial referred incorrectly in some copies to the state for which James E. Doyle is attorney general. It is Wisconsin, not Illinois.
11/10/1999	Scratching the Popular Itch to Switch Jobs	Sally Poliak will never forget her political victories. She also never wants to relive them. For nearly 14 years, starting shortly after graduating from college in 1983, Ms. Poliak was a top Republican Party consultant in Washington State. From her Seattle headquarters, she ran campaigns for offices ranging from county commissioner to member of Congress. She also organized fund-raising events, including several for former President George Bush. Her political high point came in November 1994 when she won $200 in the Hacks and Flacks pool, an election-day wager among political consultants and reporters in the Seattle area, even as more than two dozen state legislative candidates she represented won office.
11/10/1999	Europeans Have Deferred to U.S. in Microsoft Litigation	It is almost impossible to walk into an office in Europe and not bump into desktop computers that run Windows 95 and other Microsoft programs like Word and Excel. So it was hardly surprising that the scathing appraisal issued in the Microsoft case by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson last Friday has been front-page news across the Continent. ''Bill Gates has had it now,'' Die Tageszeitung, an irreverent left-of-center paper in Berlin, said. The conservative Die Welt predicted that ''the giant will pull its head out of the noose.''
11/10/1999	Prosecutors Seeking to Break The Grip of Windows System	The state and federal officials prosecuting the Microsoft antitrust case now say that their goal in any settlement, or court-imposed remedy, will be to break the company's monopoly in personal computer operating systems, or limit its ability to wield such monopoly power. The Justice Department officials and state attorneys general have not decided how that should be done. Several proposals are on the table, from forcing the Microsoft Corporation to publish the proprietary code for the Windows operating system to breaking up the company.
11/9/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Breakup of Microsoft? Possibly, but Investors Shrug It Off	A BREAKUP of the Microsoft Corporation -- the world's most valuable company -- appeared somewhat more plausible yesterday, after the release on Friday of a Federal judge's finding that the government had proved that the company had a monopoly and had used it to stifle competition. But after a weekend of reflection, investors seemed to decide that even a breakup -- the harshest of possible remedies -- would not be a disaster for Microsoft shareholders or the stock market. Yesterday, most indexes gained despite Microsoft's fall of $1.625 a share from Friday's close, which came before the finding was released. Indeed, yesterday's close of $90 was more than the $87 a share reached in after-hours trading on Friday, after the decision was known.
11/9/1999	NORTEL NETWORKS FORMS AN ALLIANCE WITH MICROSOFT	The Nortel Networks Corporation plans to announce today an alliance with the Microsoft Corporation that will make much of Nortel's networking code available to outside developers, executives close to the deal said yesterday. Nortel also intends to announce price cuts of as much as 50 percent for many of the data networking products that it has developed with Bay Networks Inc., which Nortel acquired for $9.1 billion in 1998, the executives said. The announcements could be made as soon as today. Nortel declined to comment on the report. Nortel, which is locked in an intense battle in the communications equipment industry has taken market share from many telecommunications equipment companies as it has linked its fortunes to the Internet.

Barksdale, the former president of Netscape Communications, appeared on television, radio and in newspapers, commenting from opposite sides of the Microsoft antitrust case. But today, they are putting those differences aside to focus on a shared interest in high technology as board members of a new research organization, the Internet Policy Institute. The founders -- a diverse collection of corporate sponsors, Internet pioneers and political figures -- say their Washington-based nonprofit institute is intended to be a source of influential and independent research for policy makers.

11/9/1999	From the Candidates, a Deafening Silence	A Federal judge's finding last week that Microsoft is a monopoly that has stifled competition has left this season's crop of presidential candidates speechless. In an already overheated campaign season with candidates commenting on all sorts of issues, the lack of comment on the landmark case has been striking. No leading Republican or Democratic candidate, or his spokesman, has said anything substantive about the findings of fact released Friday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, even though the document has rocked the technology world. Nor have they laid out their views on the kind of antitrust issues that the Microsoft case and the yearlong trial have raised.
11/8/1999	Silicon Valley Cites Concern Amid Glee on Microsoft Case	In Silicon Valley, the nation's high-technology capital, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's powerful findings in the Microsoft antitrust case have been received with a sense of vindication but also ambivalence. In issuing his findings of fact on Friday evening, Judge Jackson delivered two implicit yet unmistakable messages to the industry. Yes, he found, there is indeed a ''Microsoft problem'' in the computer business, and the software monopolist's bullying tactics hurt consumers and undermine innovation. He also found that there was nothing special about the software industry. For purposes of antitrust, he found, this high-technology world was not much different than any other bricks-and-mortar business.
11/8/1999	Some Software Users Wary of Judge's Findings	As the Justice Department and some in the technology industry celebrated a federal judge's finding this weekend that Microsoft had hurt consumers by abusing its Windows monopoly, Bob Mirell was browsing the software aisles at CompUSA in Midtown Manhattan feeling decidedly unwounded. ''Why knock down a company that has a superior product?'' asked Mr. Mirell, 52, who uses Microsoft's software at home and in his printing business. ''If they've cornered the market, that's because they're better.''
11/8/1999	A Top Government Lawyer Puts a Breakup on the Table	The Justice Department's top antitrust enforcer said for the first time yesterday that a breakup of Microsoft was within a range of remedies being considered in the government's antitrust suit against the software giant. Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said on the ABC News program ''This Week'' that a wide range of remedies was being considered after a federal court's findings of fact on Friday, and that a breakup was ''in the range.'' But he cautioned that Justice officials had not decided on any tack.
11/8/1999	What Really Scares Microsoft	A federal judge has made it official: Microsoft is a monopoly, a two-ton bully that squashes competitors and cheats consumers. Still, no matter how much the government lawyers crow or Bill Gates complains, the fact is that the real future of the software industry is already being decided entirely outside the court system -- in a technological marketplace too fast-moving and too accepting of good new ideas to be artificially held in check. In his findings of fact issued on Friday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson concluded that Microsoft had hindered technological creativity, that its attempts to protect the profits from its core products would prevent innovations that would benefit consumers. This was in keeping with the rhetoric of ''innovation'' deployed by both sides in the case. The Justice Department argues that protecting innovation means blocking Microsoft's ability to use the power of its Windows licenses to crush upstart competitors or competing ideas. Microsoft, for its part, does not want to ask regulatory permission to add features to its operating system, and it clearly doesn't want to become a lawyer-bound bureaucracy like the I.B.M. of Microsoft's formative years.
11/7/1999	Microsoft's Horizon	For more than a year, the Microsoft Corporation has been untarnished on Wall Street and on Main Street from the government's relentless antitrust assault on the company. But suddenly, it may begin feeling some pain as investors and the computer industry consider the likely impact of the blow delivered on Friday evening by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The judge, who is deciding the antitrust case without a jury, took a defining first step toward a verdict, with findings of fact that concluded that Microsoft was a monopoly whose bullying tactics had hurt consumers and the economy by stifling innovation in the computer industry.
11/7/1999	Making Alterations For the New Dow 30	An overhaul of the Dow Jones industrial average was completed last week, but it caused barely a murmur in the mutual fund universe. After all, very few funds explicitly track that venerable benchmark, which on Monday dropped four issues -- Union Carbide, Goodyear, Chevron and Sears, Roebuck -- while adding four standard-bearers of the new economy -- Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot and SBC Communications. But the makeover meant a lot to Richard Moroney, co-manager of the $110 million Strong Dow 30 Value fund. It indexes half of its portfolio to the Dow, then uses various Dow valuation theories to weight the other half, which also holds only Dow stocks.
11/7/1999	Technology Too High? And Now Microsoft	WHAT a week it was for true believers in technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average almost doubled its weighting in technology shares last Monday when it added Microsoft, Intel and SBC Communications to its 30-company list. And on Wednesday, white-hot technology shares propelled the Nasdaq composite above the 3,000 mark for the first time. At Friday's close, the Nasdaq composite was up a blazing 41.48 percent this year. Not surprisingly, investors are flocking to mutual funds that invest in technology stocks. For the week that ended on Nov. 3, almost $700 million went into technology funds, roughly double the amount that migrated there in other recent weeks. According to AMG Data Services, assets in equity and technology mutual funds grew more in that week than they have since the week that ended on Oct. 21, 1998.
11/7/1999	How Microsoft Sought Friends In Washington	Twenty months ago, Representative Billy Tauzin walked into the office of William H. Gates 3rd, chairman of Microsoft, bearing a 10 inch by 10 inch white box and a warning. Mr. Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and the chairman of a subcommittee that oversees the telecommunications industry, placed the box on Mr. Gates's desk. Inside was a lemon meringue pie, a reminder of another pie that had been thrown in Mr. Gates's face several weeks earlier by a Microsoft critic. The message to Mr. Gates, the richest man on earth and the leader of the digital world, was blunt: You need to make friends in Washington.
11/7/1999	Microsoft's Friends Rue the Findings, Its Foes Relish Them	James L. Barksdale, the former president of the Netscape Communications Corporation, was the first witness to take the stand in the Microsoft case. In fact, it was his company's complaints about Microsoft's behavior that captured the Justice Department's attention and touched off the investigation and trial that is now coming to a close. Last night, the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, issued his findings of fact in the case, asserting that the Microsoft Corporation was a monopolist that abused its market power in order to stifle competition, to the detriment of consumers and the computer industry.
11/7/1999	Setback for a Software Giant: Key Sections of Judge's Findings of Fact	Following are excerpts from the findings of fact issued Friday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the Microsoft antitrust case:
11/6/1999	U.S. VERSUS MICROSOFT: THE JUDGE -- Man in the News; Finding Fault With Microsoft -- In His Biggest Trial, a Judge Makes His Opinions Clear	Thomas Penfield Jackson seems a natural as a judge. He's a big man, white haired, avuncular. But he did not seem a clear natural for the Microsoft trial. Judge Jackson is hardly a technophile; he has been known to write opinions longhand. And while the fast moving world of technology demanded an equally fast-paced trial, Judge Jackson got in trouble once for allowing a trial to go on too long -- so long, in fact, that an appellate court ordered him to rule.
11/6/1999	Clear Finding in Blunt Language	With a 207-page legal document, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has fashioned a club and wielded it against the Microsoft Corporation. In findings of fact that echo almost every one of the Government's accusations in its sweeping antitrust suit against the big software maker, Judge Jackson has concluded that Microsoft is a monopolist that time and again bullied other companies in the computer industry, harming consumers and hindering innovation.
11/6/1999	Filings, Hearings and Decisions: Next Phase of the Case	The publication of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings of fact yesterday began a rolling series of filings, hearings and decisions that could bring the case to a close by early next year. Next, Judge Jackson will ask Microsoft and the Justice Department to file conclusions of law. These are the legal arguments and precedents that give the ruling its legal basis. Assuming Microsoft and the government do not settle the case in the meantime, these filings will probably be due by early December.
11/6/1999	U.S. JUDGE DECLARES MICROSOFT IS A MARKET-STIFLING MONOPOLY; GATES RETAINS DEFIANT STANCE	The judge in the government's antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation issued a broad denunciation of the software giant this evening as the first part of his verdict in the landmark case. The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court, said the company had used its monopoly power to stifle innovation, reduce competition and hurt consumers.
11/6/1999	The Microsoft Findings	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's long-awaited conclusions in the Microsoft antitrust case were labeled as simple ''findings of fact.'' But by declaring that the software giant built by Bill Gates had ruthlessly stifled competition and harmed consumers, Judge Jackson went further than most experts expected in declaring Microsoft guilty of misconduct as a monopoly. Mr. Gates and his stunned aides indicated that they intended to appeal the decision. But the sweeping nature of the finding suggests that Judge Jackson wants to provoke settlement talks between Microsoft and the government on possible remedies. A settlement would let the court avoid ordering a breakup of a company that has helped drive the growth of the American economy. The long Microsoft trial yielded some riveting moments. But nothing in the trial was as dramatic as Judge Jackson's 207-page document. The case began as a Justice Department accusation that Microsoft's tying of its own browser to its Windows operating system was an attempt to stifle the rival browser produced by Netscape. Then Justice broadened the case by bringing in what it said was misconduct by Microsoft against other rivals and competitors. The most striking aspect of Judge Jackson's decision was that he accepted these other examples, declaring that the company had, as a factual matter, engaged in anti-competitive conduct against Netscape, I.B.M., Compaq and other giants in the computer and software business.
11/6/1999	Conceding Nothing, Gates Sees Finding As Only One Step	Smiling stiffly, conceding no predatory behavior whatsoever and insisting that Microsoft's actions had in fact ''brought tremendous benefits to millions of consumers,'' William H. Gates defiantly took issue this evening with a federal judge's finding that the company had engaged in monopolistic behavior. With the company he co-founded in 1975 under siege from the government, Mr. Gates appeared at a news conference at Microsoft headquarters here barely an hour after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his finding.
11/6/1999	In a Contest of Conflicting Facts, It Finally Came Down to Whom the Judge Believed	It was a case in which 26 witnesses put forth a bewildering number of contradictory viewpoints as fact, in which a videotape sullied the legendary brilliance of the world's wealthiest man, in which two million pages of documents included thousands of e-mail messages that at times made various figures in the case look greedy, ruthless, egomaniacal or just plain dishonest. All this was handed not to a jury but to a single federal judge whose job it was to determine what was fact and what was not. Yesterday, he made his calls.
11/6/1999	Government Lawyers Say Facts, Not Strategy, Proved Case	Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding victory this evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to the simple truth. ''This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had agreed with the government. ''This case is about the protection of innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the products they want.''
11/5/1999	A Shareholder, And a Citizen	Soon, possibly tonight, a federal judge will rule on the Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft. But whatever the decision, it's only the first round in this and related litigation. That's why I've been spending my money lobbying Congress to cut the budget of the Justice Department's antitrust division. I've also hired a fleet of Washington lobbyists to persuade Congress that the government's lawsuit is misguided and launched a ''grass roots'' Internet campaign to get other people to send messages to their representatives saying the same thing. I've sent money to Republican and Democratic campaign committees, which will use it to benefit candidates sympathetic toward Microsoft. I've even organized lobbying in state capitals to get the message out to state lawmakers.
11/5/1999	$500 Million Teligent Stake Seen for Microsoft-Led Group	Giving a vote of confidence to the concept of delivering advanced data communications services using wireless links, a group including Microsoft and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, the investment firm, is close to a deal to invest $500 million in Teligent Inc., people close to the negotiations said yesterday. Though the talks could still fail, an agreement could be announced as soon as today, the people said.
11/4/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Blazing Hot and Highly Volatile	THE Nasdaq composite index began in February 1971, an attempt to get attention for the small stocks that traded in the then-new Nasdaq market of what had been known as over-the-counter stocks. The index, set at 100 when it was introduced, took 12 years to triple to 300. Yesterday, that index, now featuring some of the largest and hottest stocks in the world, closed above 3,000 for the first time. It took less than four-and-a-half years to triple after it first reached 1,000. It added 1,000 points in only 16 months after first reaching 2,000 in the summer of 1998.
11/4/1999	World's Worth of Black History and Culture	ENCARTA AFRICANA 2000 (Microsoft; $69.95, before $30 rebate; Windows 95 and 98.) HOW often do you need a new encyclopedia? In the good old days of paper encyclopedias, families might buy one in a lifetime. With today's electronic versions, they are expected to ante up every year or so. The latest example of an updated electronic encyclopedia is Encarta Africana 2000, a smartly reworked version of the breakthrough reference CD-ROM's covering black culture and history. The original Encarta Africana was released only last January. The new version is arriving in stores in time for the holidays. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a Harvard University professor and co-editor of the Africana encyclopedias, said work on the update began before the first version was released. ''We had a couple of things we really wanted to do,'' Dr. Appiah said, like adding rare audio snippets of speeches made by Marcus Garvey and Booker T. Washington.
11/4/1999	A Chilly Welcome For Digital Wallets	YOU have hunted through countless Web sites, found the perfect gift at the best price. Now all that is left is to fill out an order form the length of a corporate tax return. For all its promises of unrestrained consumerism, the Web makes the act of paying a daunting task. Most sites force customers to peck out line after line of personal data and lengthy credit card numbers before they will take their money.
11/1/1999	Awaiting Verdict, Microsoft Starts Lobbying Campaign	The first part of the verdict in the Microsoft trial is due out soon, perhaps as soon as Friday. But the Microsoft Corporation is already looking past the legal case and lobbying the government to pass laws that would protect the company in areas where it is being challenged in court. When the company distributed its annual report in September, two million shareholders also got a letter from Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, urging them to join a lobbying effort to protect what the company calls its ''freedom to innovate.''
11/1/1999	Microsoft's Lobbying Abuses	For at least four years, Microsoft has deployed a legal team to battle the Justice Department's antitrust investigation and lawsuit. The company has also waged a lavish public relations campaign to persuade Americans that it is being unfairly targeted and punished for its success in producing software that consumers want. These are standard practices for businesses under attack. But this year the software giant overstepped the boundaries of legitimate opposition by lobbying Congress to reduce the proposed budget of the Justice Department's antitrust division, a step tantamount to punishing the department for pressing the antitrust case. Congress should not go along. At a time of global competitiveness and fluid markets, some have argued that vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws is no longer necessary. But under Joel Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust division has argued that the new world markets make it all the more important to be vigilant against international price-fixing schemes and mergers that stifle competition and hurt consumers. The antitrust division needs more resources, not less, to do the job. In January, President Clinton asked Congress to approve a budget of $114 million for the new year, up from $101 million in the previous year. In the budget battles of this fall, a House-Senate conference approved $110 million but only after rejecting attempts by lawmakers, with encouragement from Microsoft, to lower it significantly.
10/31/1999	After Its Latest Facelift, A Younger, Sexier Dow	THE Dow Jones industrial average has long been viewed as the most prominent measure of the financial health of corporate America. Maybe now it should be seen as a barometer of how fast the economy is changing. Last week the keepers of the Dow -- the editors of The Wall Street Journal -- announced plans to boot four perfectly respectable companies and replace them with younger and better-performing substitutes. It was the third time in the 1990's that such a thing had happened. All told, 11 of the 30 stocks in the Dow are new in this decade.
10/31/1999	Chat: Alan to Bill to Trent, Janet to Bill, and Larry to Bob	IT was a busy week in Washington for politics and policy on economic and financial issues. Imagine that you could take a peek at the E-mail traffic among the big players. You might, or might not, have seen something like this. (And no, the addresses are not real.) To: billc@whitehouse.gov From: greenspan@fed.gov Thank you, Mr. President, for letting me know privately that you will reappoint me to a fourth term as Fed chairman when the time comes next year. It will be a privilege to continue in public service and to seek to maintain the vibrancy of the Greenspan Economy -- I mean, Clinton Economy.
10/28/1999	A New Web Site for Armchair Marathoners	As race time approaches for the 30th New York City marathon on Nov. 7, runners, spectators and enthusiasts can get a preview of the 26.2-mile pageant of sweat, muscle and determination by way of a new Web site. Microsoft, an official Internet sponsor of the race, has joined the New York Road Runners Club, which puts on the race, in developing a site that offers training tips, weather reports, suggestions of the best locations to see the race, marathon trivia and screen savers.
10/28/1999	The Blind Leading the Sighted	GREGG VANDERHEIDEN regularly washes his own clothes, but unlike most people, he never loses any socks. He is immune to that modern plague because he uses sock sorters, small plastic rings that keep each pair together in the laundry. ''I haven't had a mismatched or incomplete pair in years,'' Mr. Vanderheiden said.
10/27/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Dow Takes On a New, High-Technology Look	THE Dow Jones industrial average, whose performance has trailed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in recent years, dropped four lagging stocks yesterday and substituted four companies that have done much better. By adding two high-flying technology companies, the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, the editors of The Wall Street Journal, who determine the index's components, made it likely that the Dow will be more volatile than it has been. Whether it will also be a better performer is likely to turn on the question of whether large technology stocks remain market leaders.
10/20/1999	Lifting Spirits On Wall Street, Microsoft Profit Beats Forecasts	The Microsoft Corporation reported quarterly earnings yesterday that convincingly surpassed Wall Street's expectations and reflected strong demand for personal computers and their software. Analysts said the encouraging report from Microsoft, the world's leading software maker, is likely to lift investors' confidence in the shares of high-technology companies, which have recently fallen sharply. ''This will probably be a bullish signal for the beaten-down technology stocks,'' said Rick Sherlund of Goldman, Sachs & Company.
10/18/1999	Supporters of Linux Worry That Commercialization Could Bring Chaos	Graying nerds who recall the Balkanization of Unix into a slew of incompatible operating systems may be reliving history with the proliferation of Linux brands. Just as Unix once promised to be the lingua franca of open systems, the Linux operating system, itself a variant of Unix, has been held out as standard for the open-source movement. But there is growing concern that just as the Unix world slid into chaos like a modern Tower of Babel, the commercialization of Linux will lead to systems that cannot understand each other.
10/15/1999	ANOTHER WIRELESS NET VENTURE	A day after the palm computing unit of the 3Com Corporation announced an ambitious alliance with Nokia to make its software available on mobile phones, the Microsoft Corporation struck back by announcing its own alliance with British Telecommunications to develop new ways to get access to the Internet wirelessly using Windows CE, a scaled-down version of Windows 98 used in hand-held digital devices. Both British Telecom, which operates BT Cellnet, and Microsoft have been slow to enter the wireless arena. Andrew Ross Sorkin (NYT)
10/14/1999	Microsoft Sued By Priceline	Priceline.com, which lets consumers bid on the Internet for plane tickets and hotel rooms, said today that it had filed a suit against the Microsoft Corporation, contending that Microsoft's new hotel service violates a Priceline patent. Priceline.com, based in Stamford, said it filed the suit in Federal District Court in Connecticut against Microsoft and its Expedia.com Web site. Last month, Microsoft began a service on Expedia that lets consumers name their price for hotel rooms.
10/14/1999	Palm Computing and Wireless Makers Form Partnership	The Palm Computing unit of the 3Com Corporation announced a partnership today with Symbian, a joint venture of the wireless phone makers Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, Psion and Matsushita, forming an alliance to create a de facto standard for wireless Internet access. The move is a serious blow to the Microsoft Corporation, whose Windows CE operating system for hand-held devices has failed to make headway against Palm Computing's Palm operating system in the United States or Psion's Epoc operating system in Europe. Microsoft has sought to gain support for Windows CE from cellular phone manufacturers, but today's announcement makes it very unlikely that Windows CE will be widely used in mobile phones anytime soon.
10/11/1999	Compressed Data; Creative Labs Adopts Windows Audio Format	Digging deeper into the digital music market, Microsoft said last week that Creative Labs' Nomad II portable player, scheduled for release in January, would be able to store and play music in the Windows Media Audio format. The announcement followed several agreements Microsoft had forged with equipment makers in this market. Diamond Multimedia, the leading portable player manufacturer, announced future support for Windows Media in June. Late last month, Cirrus Logic announced that it was offering a new line of chips that would automatically support the Windows Media format. Microsoft is trying to establish Windows Media Audio as a de facto industry standard for digital music formats that provide copyright protection. Currently, MP3, the most popular digital audio format, does not provide such protection all by itself.
10/11/1999	Unsung Success in Revamping Software Holds a Clue to the Turnaround at Apple	Much has been said and written about the turnaround at Apple Computer in recent years, as measured by its return to profitability, the resurgence of its share price and the explosive sales of its fruit-colored iMac machines. But in fact, the seeds of Apple's remarkable renaissance were sown in a contentious meeting that took place here in January 1997 and that involved the unsung part of Apple's business: software. The meeting was held only days after Apple's chairman at the time, Gilbert F. Amelio, purchased Steven P. Jobs's Next Computer. And Next's chief software designer, Avidis Tevanian Jr., was huddling for the first time with Apple's top engineers. The session, according to several people who participated, escalated into a shouting match between Mr. Tevanian and the head of Copland -- Apple's troubled effort to create a next-generation operating system.
10/11/1999	I.B.M. to Take Part in Alliance With Other Computer Giants To Better E-Commerce Security	I.B.M., the world's largest computer company, said today that it would become part of an industry alliance to create better security for electronic-commerce transactions. In addition to I.B.M., the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance includes the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Hewlett-Packard Company, the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation.
10/8/1999	Microsoft Adds To McCann Work	The Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash., has expanded its relationship with McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising by awarding a new account to McCann-Erickson Europe. Billings were estimated at more than $50 million. The campaign will promote Microsoft's E-commerce products to business customers in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
10/5/1999	Microsoft and M.I.T. to Develop Technologies	In a move that is expected to have a significant impact on the role of technology in university education, the Microsoft Corporation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will announce today a partnership to develop educational technologies. The collaboration, in which Microsoft will initially invest $25 million over five years, is the largest alliance both in size and scale that the company has made to date with any university. It will be known as I-Campus.
10/4/1999	Corrections	The State of the Art column in Circuits on Sept. 23, about a new Microsoft computer mouse called the Intellimouse Explorer, misstated the operating-system requirements. Windows 98 is needed -- and Windows 98 Second Edition recommended -- for only the version that has the mouse link to the computer through a Universal Serial Bus connection, not for all versions.
10/4/1999	Recording Industry Escalates Crackdown on Digital Piracy	For years, frustrated record companies have watched helplessly as millions of illegally copied songs circulated on the Internet, but a crackdown on digital piracy that will have a wide-ranging impact on consumers is about to begin. In fact, the first elements are already in place. Few consumers are aware that Philips CD burners, the devices that record data or music on compact disks, have been adding a digital serial number to every CD the machines make to enable copyright owners to trace any recording to the machine that made it.
10/3/1999	Staying in Toyland	When your own house is on fire, it's no time to be lingering down the block at the neighbors'. And so Jill E. Barad, chief executive of Mattel, said last week that she would not seek re-election to the Microsoft board, which she joined in 1996. In an era when corporate boards strive for diversity, her departure would leave the Microsoft board without a woman. The board, relatively small with just six members left, has no plans to add others.
10/3/1999	Charity Begins in the Home PC	REMEMBER the Boston Tea Party? If my high school history teacher is to be believed, the colonists' complaint was about taxation without representation. That very phrase stuck in my mind when I read the announcement by the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates, that his foundation would provide $1 billion in college scholarships for minority students.
10/1/1999	The Market Sets Value	To the Editor: Re ''Stocks Plunge Over Remark on Microsoft'' (Business Day, Sept. 24):
9/27/1999	Microsoft Acts on Digital Music By Getting Support From Cirrus	Trying to gain a stronger foothold in the growing digital music market, the Microsoft Corporation plans to announce on Monday that the newest line of Internet audio chips from Cirrus Logic will support Microsoft's Windows Media audio format. As a result, portable digital music players and other devices built with the Cirrus chip would be able to play music encoded with Windows Media technology. Moreover, the right to use the Microsoft technology is included in the price of the chip.
9/24/1999	Stocks Plunge Over Remark On Microsoft	Stock prices, already weighed down by fears about interest rates and the dollar, fell hard yesterday after the president of Microsoft said high-technology companies like his were considerably overvalued. A session in which most prices were meandering lower was quickly transformed into a steep decline, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq market absorbing a loss of 3.79 percent, its biggest since April. The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 205.48 points, or 1.95 percent, closed at 10,318.59. That put it more than 1,000 points below its record set on Aug. 25.
9/24/1999	2 Providers Of Net Access Set to Merge	Earthlink Network Inc. and Mindspring Enterprises Inc., two pioneers in the business of selling Internet access, announced a merger agreement yesterday, with hopes of more effectively challenging America Online. The merger, a $1.7 billion stock swap, creates a company with 2.8 million subscribers. It will be named Earthlink but will operate out of Atlanta, Mindspring's home. Earthlink is now based in Pasadena, Calif.
9/24/1999	Microsoft Sets Shifts in Internet Strategy	The Microsoft Corporation disclosed several pieces of its new Internet strategy today, saying that it would offer the public a piece of its most successful on-line effort, the Expedia travel site; would significantly redesign its MSN portal, and would introduce a network computing device. Anticipating a world in which software will be sold as a service instead of a packaged good, the company said it would re-introduce MSN, shifting its focus to on-line communications, improved information searching and electronic commerce.
9/23/1999	Some Errors Are Not So Bad	To the Editor: ''Global Ambitions for a Microsoft Dictionary'' finds several errors and bugs in the new Encarta dictionary, among them a missing megaphone button that would make the computer pronounce ''shut down.''
9/23/1999	Works Suite 2000 Weighs In As a Hefty Microsoft Upgrade	With the accordionlike expansion of hard drive space on new personal computers, software developers appear increasingly comfortable offering consumers more huge programs that fill them up. This week, Microsoft released Works Suite 2000, an integrated collection of utility and reference applications that is a kind of office suite for the home computer user. The program is at least 400 percent larger than Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system.
9/23/1999	Building Smarter Mice	THIS has been a big month for mice. First, a biologist at Princeton disclosed that he had genetically engineered a smarter mouse with improved learning, memory and intelligence skills, and now the technologists in Microsoft's hardware division have digitally engineered a new batch of smarter, more talented computer mice. After remaining fundamentally unchanged for a long time -- millions of years, in the case of biological mice, and more than three decades for computer mice -- we are now at the dawn of a new era of super mice.
9/23/1999	Silicon Valley Research Laboratory Is Changing Its Direction	A Silicon Valley research laboratory, established seven years ago to leapfrog generations of computer technologies, is taking a narrower direction that reflects the changing interests of the Microsoft co-founder who financed it. In the midst of the change, David E. Liddle, a prominent computer scientist who founded the laboratory, Interval Research Corporation, has stepped down as director. Mr. Liddle's relationship with Paul Allen, the Microsoft Corporation cofounder who seeded Interval with a $100 million investment over 10 years, grew strained in the past year, several employees said, as Mr. Allen increasingly pushed Interval to focus its research on his business strategy in the cable industry.
9/23/1999	A Program That Lets You Talk Your Way Around	Don't be alarmed if you find someone muttering ''whisky, whisky, whisky'' at their computer. They may be using Conversa Web, which allows users to run Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser with their voices rather than their hands. Instead of clicking on Web page links, Conversa Web users simply read them out loud. For graphics that provide links, the program generates miniature cartoon bubbles containing a number that is read aloud to make the link -- the company calls them ''saycons.'' Simple spoken phrases like ''go back'' operate the browser's navigation commands. Conversa Web can be used only to operate the browser, not for dictation.
9/22/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Nasdaq, Once Hot for a Public Issue, Now Heading Private	JUST a few months ago, the buzz among the Nasdaq market's members and advisers was I.P.O. -- an initial public offering of Nasdaq shares that would transform the market where some of America's hottest technology stocks are traded. But lately, the talk has shifted. Now, the emphasis is on a private placement, an arrangement that would allow the National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's owner, to sell a minority part of its stake privately to substantial outsiders, including Wall Street firms and even technology giants like Microsoft and Intel.
9/22/1999	Last Arguments Are Offered in Microsoft Case	Almost a year after it began, the Microsoft antitrust trial wound to a close today with final arguments from lawyers for the company and the Government that ranged from scornful to contemptuous of the other side's case. When it was over, at dusk this evening, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said simply, ''Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.'' He then rose from the bench and marched unceremoniously from the packed courtroom.
9/21/1999	Did Microsoft's Money Taint a Defender's Ad?	To the Editor: Microsoft's secret financing of the so-called Independent Institute (front page, Sept. 18) is disturbingly similar to conduct that the United States Supreme Court has found to constitute fraud on the court.
9/21/1999	MICROSOFT BUYING ASSETS OF SOFTWAY SYSTEMS	The Microsoft Corporation bought the assets of the closely held Softway Systems Inc. to get tools that allow its Windows system to work with other applications. Terms were not disclosed. Softway, which is based in San Francisco, makes products that allow Microsoft's Windows and the Unix computer-operating system to work together, so clients can run Unix applications on the Windows system.
9/21/1999	Microsoft Virus Warning	Microsoft warned customers today that hackers were distributing virus-infected E-mail purportedly from the company offering new software to combat Year 2000 computer problems. Microsoft said there might be up to eight versions of the message, one of which, entitled Y2Kcount.exe, appears to come from a Microsoft electronic address, support@microsoft.com. Microsoft said the E-mail message was a hoax and consumers should delete it and not open the attachment.
9/21/1999	A Web-Researched Ford in Microsoft's Future	A joint venture of the Microsoft Corporation with the Ford Motor Company, offering built-to-order automobiles via the World Wide Web, shows the potentially wrenching changes that electronic commerce is bringing in its wake. At a news conference here today, Microsoft and Ford executives took pains to argue that their venture -- allowing on-line customers to configure their own cars and obtain detailed information on product availability -- would not displace the traditional role of the car dealer.
9/21/1999	Did Microsoft's Money Taint a Defender's Ad?	To the Editor: I was one of the 240 signers of the newspaper advertisement, sponsored by the Independent Institute, defending Microsoft from antitrust attack (front page, Sept. 18). Like the other signers, I was unaware that Microsoft had footed the bill for the ad.
9/20/1999	Microsoft On-Line Alliance With Ford Expected Today	The Microsoft Corporation's plans for the Internet have shifted uncertainly in recent years, but a series of announcements expected this week is intended to emphasize its new, narrower focus as a supplier of software for the World Wide Web and electronic commerce services. Microsoft intends today to announce an alliance between MSN Carpoint, its on-line car-shopping service, and the Ford Motor Company, according to consultants who have been told of the agreement.
9/19/1999	Microsoft Storms The Web Again	THE personal-computer software vein it has mined with mind-boggling success isn't about to dry up, but Microsoft is busy planning how to tap into the next Mother Lode. The good news for shareholders is that the executives out in Redmond, Wash., know that tomorrow's gold is on the World Wide Web. The bad news is that for the last few years lots of other companies have been prospecting the Net.
9/18/1999	Microsoft Covered Cost of Ads Backing It in Antitrust Suit	Newspaper advertisements that a California institute presented as independent views supporting the Microsoft Corporation's position in its antitrust trial were actually paid for by Microsoft, the institute said today. The full-page newspaper ads, published in The New York Times and The Washington Post by the Independent Institute last June, were in the form of a letter signed by 240 academic experts. They prompted news stories and courtroom discussion during the trial.
9/17/1999	Big Internet Sites Joining Auction Network	Nearly 100 Internet sites, including three of the biggest -- Microsoft's MSN, Excite@Home and Lycos -- have agreed to share their auction listings so that an item put up for sale on one site will be available for bidding on all other sites. The move, which is to be announced today, is an effort to catch up with the huge popularity of Ebay, the dominant on-line auction site, which has more than three million items for sale at any one time, ranging from stuffed bears to minivans.
9/16/1999	Global Ambitions for a Microsoft Dictionary	A DICTIONARY'S main job is to answer questions, not to provoke them. But even before installing the Encarta World English Dictionary, I was arguing with the claims printed on its box. Microsoft is marketing this product as ''the world's first global English dictionary.'' Oh? What about the Oxford English Dictionary, that 20-volume, 40,000-page, continually updated record of the English language as spoken everywhere in the world (and available, incidentally, both in its entirety and in abridged form on CD-ROM)? Let's go to promotional claim No. 2: ''Created for the new age of global communication.'' I couldn't argue with that. It was immediately apparent from the print version, released in July, that this dictionary is multicultural in tone and content to an extent that is, indeed, unprecedented. That attitude (and latitude) is even more pronounced in the audiovisually empowered CD-ROM. The idea of an absolutely up-to-the-moment, sex- and race-sensitive dictionary with built-in Roget's Thesaurus, Computer Dictionary, Style Guide, Almanac and Book of Quotations is a good one. But how does such an ambitious project work in actual use?
9/16/1999	Even a Mouse That Roars Can Sit on the Sidelines	BUILD a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door. It stands to reason that the time-worn adage about innovation and capitalist reward would apply to better mice as well, at least of the computer variety. By that measure, the vertical mouse, which resembles a gamer's joystick, ought to be poised for commercial success. Last week, The International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, a respected quarterly, published a study that said switching to the odd-looking mouse had reduced the pain suffered by computer users in their hands, arms and necks and also trimmed the number of workdays lost to sick leave.
9/14/1999	Microsoft Starts The Recruiting For Its Next War	The browser war may be a memory, but executives of the Microsoft Corporation conceded today that the company now faced an even greater challenge in the next phase of the Internet's evolution, as the role of traditional desktop software recedes and the power center of computing shifts from the operating system to the World Wide Web. Software is increasingly becoming a Web-based service whose main goal is to hasten the spread of electronic commerce over the Internet. At an event here to sketch out in broad strokes Microsoft's technical blueprint for Web software, the company's president, Steven Ballmer, gave his most candid appraisal to date of the hurdle his company faces.
9/13/1999	E-Mail Offers New Insights To Microsoft Trial Strategy	The Microsoft Corporation and the Government filed new declarations in court on Friday, revising the voluminous findings of fact each side filed last month in the Federal antitrust suit against the company. But more revealing may be the internal Microsoft discussions that play out in a long series of E-mails that the Government subpoenaed from the company and entered into evidence with little notice last month. Those discussions involved the public relations campaign that the company quickly devised when news broke last November that the Netscape Communications Corporation -- which the antitrust suit casts as a victim of Microsoft's monopoly -- was being acquired by America Online Inc.
9/12/1999	Elder Bill Gates Takes On The Role of Philanthropist	When John D. Rockefeller turned his attention to philanthropic causes earlier this century, he relied in many ways on his son, John D. Jr., for help in deciding how to disburse his colossal oil fortune. Both father and son famously brooded, at times to the verge of mental exhaustion, over how hard it was to give away money in an intelligent and useful fashion. But for William H. Gates 3d, the 43-year-old founder and chairman of the Microsoft Corporation and now the wealthiest person on the planet, it may be a while before he asks his children for help with his philanthropic endeavors. After all, Jennifer is only 3, and Rory John is shy of 4 months.
9/9/1999	The Wind in Your Hair, Your E-Mail on the Dash	I'VE made the 16-mile trip from my apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side to a favorite restaurant on City Island in the Bronx dozens of times. Yet a recent drive there over the asphalt spaghetti of parkways and interstate expressways was, thanks to the latest injection of digital technology into our lives, like no other. Besides the voices of my wife and 3-year-old daughter in the car, there was a robotic voice emanating from the automobile's in-dash personal computer.
9/9/1999	A Way to Use the Voice Instead of the Fingers	You may never have to touch your computer again. That's one of the more muted promises behind I.B.M.'s latest voice recognition software, Via Voice Millennium. The new software package can automatically integrate itself with either Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator or America Online's propriety software, enabling users to dictate E-mail and chat room submissions and to control the browser and E-mail programs by speaking. Going the other way, the software can also read E-mail aloud to users.
9/9/1999	Where the Help Desk Goes for Good Advice	LOCKER GNOME www.lockergnome.com LOCKER GNOME started life as a newsletter about Windows 95 shareware, and the site's name sprang from an old high-school nickname of the site's founder, Chris Pirillo. For Windows users who want up-to-date information about hot new shareware and freeware, games, bugs, Web sites and industry happenings, the Locker Gnome site provides an easy-to-read source.
9/9/1999	Where the Help Desk Goes for Good Advice	WIN98 CENTRAL www.win98central.com AS the name implies, Win98 Central sets its sights squarely on the current version of Microsoft's crown jewel: the Windows operating system and all that is related to it. Under the site's nameplate and motto (''your one-stop Windows 98 Web site''), readers are greeted with headlines and summaries of the day's news concerning Windows and related products, along with general technology news. Links to the original sources of the news items are provided for further reading.
9/9/1999	A New Stylish Carrying Case For iMac Users on the Go	Way back in 1984, Apple's brochure for the first Macintosh featured the no-bigger-than-a-breadbox computer in various smart poses all over the verdant Stanford University campus. But with today's popular iMac at 38 pounds, hauling it down to the quadrangle would cause even sports scholars to break a sweat. A company called Grabpac (www.grab pac.com) hopes to ease the strain with a wraparound carry case that slips and snaps into place, much like the tight-fitting car bras designed to protect the front ends of Camaros and Corvettes. The form-and-fashion accessory comes in gray, teal or black and sells for $59.95. It cleverly manages to integrate a mouse pad into the keyboard flap, which folds up against the monitor's glass face to protect it from minor bumps and scratches. Pockets on either side give shelter to the mouse, a disk drive and a bottle of aspirin, in the event of a sore shoulder.
9/8/1999	Liberty Media Buys a Stake In European Cable Concern	The Liberty Media Group, the AT&T Corporation's cable-television programming company, agreed today to buy a stake in Europe's No. 2 cable company, United Pan-Europe Communications N.V., for $493 million in cash. Liberty is forming a joint venture with the Microsoft Corporation and United Pan-Europe to cooperate on buying other cable companies and developing programs and technology. The three will own 14.5 percent of Denver-based Unitedglobalcom Inc., which owns 62 percent of United Pan-Europe.
9/8/1999	Microsoft to Join Fiber Optic Venture in Asia	Expanding the reach of advanced fiber optic communications in Asia, the Microsoft Corporation, Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda and the Softbank Corporation of Japan have agreed to form a $1.3 billion joint venture to build a new communications web stretching from Japan to Malaysia, executives close to the agreement said yesterday. The companies intend to announce the venture, to be called Asia Global Crossing, as soon as today, the executives said.
9/8/1999	Microsoft to Start Net Hotel-Pricing Service	Imitating a competitor's patented approach, the Microsoft Corporation is introducing a Internet service that lets consumers name their own prices for hotel rooms. The concept was an innovation of the heavily promoted Priceline.com service, which last year introduced a system to let people enter the prices they would be willing to pay for airline tickets. It has since expanded to hotels, cars and mortgage loans.
9/4/1999	A Mysterious Component Roils Microsoft	A cryptographer for a Canadian software firm, dissecting a piece of Microsoft security software, made an unexpected find: an element in the Windows operating system labeled ''NSAKey.'' When his discovery was made known on his company's Web site today, it set off a firestorm of Orwellian visions in Internet discussion groups.
9/4/1999	Editorial Observer; The Man at Microsoft; or How High the Moon	In mid-July, the value of Bill Gates's Microsoft holdings reached roughly $100 billion. That is a very round number, so round, in fact, that it would take an American earning the approximate median income -- $50,000 a year -- two million years to equal it. Or, to put it another way, it would take two million Americans earning the median income to raise the same sum in a single year. It is hard to see a man when he is surrounded by the corona of that much wealth. It renders his personality, dark in the best of us, more than usually opaque and hard to read. It makes Mr. Gates, the mere man, an ironic figure who, no matter how modestly he carries himself, is always being mocked behind his back by the golem of his wealth.
9/3/1999	Microsoft Names New Leaders For Troubled Net Business	Searching for a way to revive its beleaguered Internet business, the Microsoft Corporation named a new leadership team for its on-line group yesterday and indicated that it would emphasize its technology underpinnings and continue to move away from a media strategy. As anticipated, the company named Richard Belluzzo, a longtime Silicon Valley hardware executive, as the new head of its Consumer and Commerce Group. Mr. Belluzzo, who resigned last month as chairman and chief executive of Silicon Graphics Inc. after a failed turnaround effort at that struggling work station company, will report directly to Microsoft's president, Steven Ballmer, as group vice president for the company's Internet business.
9/2/1999	Financial Software Slugfest	IN his stage play ''Millennium Bug,'' Steven Tomlinson, an economist and performance artist, describes a new software package called Veritas 2000 that not only manages your personal finances, but also your soul. Veritas 2000 promises to lead consumers out of debt and into affluence, but it does so by tracking the user's spending and savings down to the most minute level, spewing alerts and threats if a penny is spent unnecessarily. Neither Quicken 2000 Deluxe ($59.95, or $39.95 for previous Quicken users) nor its archrival, Microsoft Money 2000 Deluxe ($44.95 until Nov. 30, $64.95 afterward), dare to intrude so deeply into personal spending habits. But they do take the idea of personal financial management to new levels, especially with the aid of the Internet.
8/31/1999	Spurning PC's, Sun Challenges Rival Microsoft	Sun Microsystems Inc. is planning an ambitious campaign to move everyday software applications like word processing and spreadsheets away from the personal computer desktop and onto the World Wide Web -- a strategy that amounts to a direct assault on Microsoft's biggest business. Sun is announcing today that it has acquired Star Division G.m.b.H., a German producer of office productivity software, which moved its headquarters to California last year. Its Star Office is a bundle of programs -- word processors, spreadsheets, schedulers, personal data base and presentation software -- in the same application categories as the Microsoft Corporation's Office suite, the industry leader.
8/31/1999	Microsoft Shuts Security Breach in E-Mail System	The Microsoft Corporation scrambled today to close a security breach that had left tens of millions of personal E-mail accounts freely accessible through Web sites that were created to exploit the vulnerability. It was not clear how much private information might have been compromised and for what length of time. And while Microsoft said it had solved the problem, after shutting down the service for several hours, it was not clear whether other vulnerabilities in the E-mail service, known as Hotmail, might still exist.
8/30/1999	Microsoft Brings In Top Talent To Pursue Old Goal: The Tablet	Hoping to fulfill a dream that has eluded the industry for nearly three decades, a team of designers from the Microsoft Corporation is trying to create a so-called tablet computer. The portable, wireless, keyboardless device would be about the size and weight of a writing tablet and be intended to serve most of a person's everyday computing and Net-surfing needs. Microsoft, which has no set timetable or manufacturing plans for the tablet computer, knows that success is far from certain. ''This is a long-haul effort and the road in the past has been fraught with conspicuous failures,'' said Dick Brass, the company's vice president for emerging technologies.
8/29/1999	August 22-28; So Many Words, So Little Time	The war of words in the ordinarily staid dictionary market intensified with the publication of Microsoft's upstart new reference guide, the Encarta World English Dictionary. London's underground was plastered with Encarta posters of a coy topless model who was strategically covered by the weighty dictionary. Rival publishers like Merriam-Webster Inc. in the United States came out with their own, more subdued full-page advertisements in People and Time featuring a beaming college student in sunglasses: ''Will your performance this school year be inspired or ignominious?''
8/27/1999	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the selection of Richard E. Belluzzo, former chief executive of Silicon Graphics, to run the Internet operations of Microsoft, misstated Silicon Graphics' recent financial performance. The company posted a profit in the quarter ended June 30 after seven consecutive quarterly losses. It is not still losing money.
8/26/1999	NEWS WATCH	REVERSE MINIATURIZATION -- The word ''bloatware'' isn't just for software anymore. The new softcover manual ''Using Microsoft Office 2000: Special Edition'' has 56 chapters, 1,473 pages and weighs in at a hefty 5 pounds. (By comparison, the hardcover edition of the Websters New World Third College Dictionary is a relative lightweight, at 3 pounds, 13.5 ounces.) I.B.M.'s new Thinkpad 240 weighs only 3 pounds, which means that manuals now outweigh some of the machines that will run the programs. BARRIERS TUMBLE -- Music listeners who use the Liquid Audio system will be able to hear MP3 files on the newly released Liquid System 5.0. Liquid Audio had been popular with the music industry because the downloaded files cannot be copied, but it was not nearly so popular with the on-line music crowd as MP3. ''We're seeing a trend right across software companies, that they're becoming format agnostics,'' said Lucas Graves, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York. ''To make on-line music ready for prime time, consumers should not even need to be aware what format the music is coming in.''
8/25/1999	Computer Executive to Run Microsoft Internet Unit	Microsoft has selected Richard E. Belluzzo, a longtime computer industry executive, to head its Internet operations, signaling that its future lies more in electronic commerce than in becoming a media company. Mr. Belluzzo, 45, resigned on Monday as the chairman and chief executive of Silicon Graphics Inc., a position he held less than two years. He joined Silicon, the struggling maker of computer work stations, in January 1998, after a 22-year career at the Hewlett-Packard Company, where he rose to become the No. 2 executive.
8/24/1999	Microsoft's New Dictionary Is Well-Thumbed by Rivals	The breathless promotions for Microsoft's first foray into the rarefied dictionary market promise a mighty international reference guide for the English-speaking world -- the ''first dictionary born in the information age.'' Weightier than a laptop computer, the Encarta World English Dictionary does indeed deliver words, warnings, sensitivity traps, quick definitions and an earnest photograph of William H. Gates on page 738. (''Gates /gayts/, Bill (b.1955) U.S. entrepreneur. He co-founded Microsoft.'')
8/23/1999	Microsoft Invests in Mortgage Data Provider	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's biggest software maker, has bought a minority stake in Tuttle Decision Systems Inc. to increase offerings on Microsoft's mortgage Web site. The amount of the investment, which was announced on Friday, was not disclosed.
8/20/1999	Microsoft Discloses More Flaws in Software	Three weeks after security holes were found in its Office 97 software, the Microsoft Corporation today acknowledged similar vulnerabilities in the recently released successor, Office 2000, and in other programs. The company said it had known for several weeks about the Office 2000 flaw, which could allow data, software or hardware to be damaged via E-mail or commands sent from a malicious Web site. But it said it had chosen not to disclose the problem until a remedy was ready.
8/19/1999	Another Twist in Skirmish Over Instant Messaging	In its latest tweak at America Online, the Microsoft Corporation announced today that it would release a computer protocol to enable subscribers of competing instant-messaging services to communicate with its own customers. Microsoft officials said the move was intended to pave the way for communication among subscribers of the handful of major companies offering instant messaging, a feature that allows computer users to contact one another instantaneously and chat on line.
8/17/1999	TALK OF MICROSOFT-GLOBO DEAL	Trading was halted in shares of Globo Cabo S.A., Brazil's largest cable television company, contributing to speculation it had struck a deal that would give the Microsoft Corporation a foothold in Brazil's nascent market for high-speed Internet access through cable TV. Shares in Globo Cabo, part of the Globo media empire, have surged nearly 50 percent in the last month on local reports that an alliance is imminent. Were Microsoft to buy a minority stake, it would get a jump on competition to equip Brazil's estimated 8.5 million pay-TV customers with advanced Internet services. Simon Romero (NYT)
8/16/1999	Media Talk; Microsoft at Length in The New Yorker	The Aug. 16 issue of The New Yorker magazine harked back to an earlier time: the pre-Tina Brown days of the 23,000-word article, when the magazine was prone to 50,000-word stories about arcane subjects like zinc mining or the history of corn. The investigative piece about the antitrust lawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation, ''Hard Core'' by Ken Auletta, was the longest by far published under David Remnick, the editor who took over from Ms. Brown last July.
8/16/1999	Small Internet Providers Survive Among the Giants	America Online is the undisputed king of Internet service providers, having added 5.1 million members the last year alone, for a total of more than 17 million subscribers. But its growth rate masks a remarkable trend: the company's share of the Internet-access market is no longer growing as it once was and may, in fact, be declining. The market for Internet service providers, or I.S.P.'s, rather than consolidating around America Online, Microsoft and telephone companies like AT&T as many industry observers had predicted, remains a diverse industry with wide open possibilities for competitors, including mom-and-pop operations.
8/15/1999	How Korean Pride Rallied To Save a Software Maker	AS the Microsoft Corporation expands its dominance of the world's computer software markets, it has tried hard not to ruffle the feathers of foreign governments and nationalists, who often view the American software giant as a predator. Nevertheless, in maneuvering to gain control of the lucrative market for Korean-language word processing software, it set off a groundswell of opposition.
8/13/1999	Microsoft Says Worker Wrote Smear of Rival	The Microsoft Corporation acknowledged yesterday that one of its programmers apparently masqueraded as an independent computer consultant earlier this week in an effort to discredit America Online's tactics in the companies' quarrel over instant messaging. Microsoft had reason to be red-faced about the incident yesterday -- first, because the company was unable to identify the employee who forged an E-mail message on Tuesday accusing America Online of irresponsible behavior, and second, because whoever did it sent the message to the one computer security expert who was most likely to trace it back to Microsoft.
8/12/1999	Share Price More Than Triples In Red Hat's Public Offering	In today's initial public offering by Red Hat Inc., the leading distributor of the free Linux computer operating system, the new shares more than tripled in price by the close of trading on the Nasdaq. The sale also touched off excitement and some soul-searching among the 12,000 Linux devotees assembled here for the Linux World Expo. Industry analysts said the market's eager embrace of Red Hat indicated a belief in the potential for a free operating system to be a commercial competitor to the Microsoft Corporation's Windows NT or traditional commercial versions of Unix.
8/12/1999	MICROSOFT OFFERS ON-LINE DISCOUNT AT COSTCO	The Microsoft Corporation said this week that it was offering MSN Internet access at a 40 percent discount to its regular price through the Costco Companies, a leading chain of warehouse-club stores, as fees for online services continue to fall. Three months of service are being offered for $35.97, or $11.99 a month, compared with MSN's regular fee of $19.95 a month, said Deanna Sanford, Microsoft's lead product manager for MSN. Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, is moving to cut Internet access fees as it competes with the No. 1 on-line service provider, America Online Inc. In recent months Microsoft has formed partnerships with Staples Inc., Micro Center and Lan Plus Inc. to offer free PC's in exchange for MSN Internet service.
8/12/1999	Big Companies Back a New Web Site Aimed at Blacks	A group of big media and technology companies has agreed to back BET Holdings, which operates several black-oriented cable television stations, in establishing an elaborate Internet service aimed at black Americans. BET has raised $35 million for the project from the Microsoft Corporation, USA Networks, the News Corporation and AT&T's Liberty Media unit, which is a minority owner of BET. The service, which is known as BET.Com, is scheduled to be introduced on Nov. 1 and will replace the company's existing joint venture with Microsoft, MSBET.
8/11/1999	Silicon Graphics Expects Layoffs and a Revamping	Silicon Graphics Inc., which has been mired in losses and dwindling market share for much of the last four years, plans to lay off 1,000 to 1,500 people, or up to 15 percent of its work force, and sell or spin off several businesses, including the Cray Research line of supercomputers. The company also said today that it would record a charge of $100 million to $200 million in connection with the revamping.
8/11/1999	Justice Dept. And Microsoft Put Their Cases Into Writing	The witnesses have departed, but the paper wars began today in the Microsoft antitrust trial as both sides presented the court with book-sized documents detailing what each camp believes are the facts of the case. The Government and the Microsoft Corporation, not surprisingly, offered the court two entirely different stories. They did that in person in the courtroom beginning last October, but today's filings more sharply delineate their arguments in painstaking detail, allegation by allegation, witness by witness, E-mail by E-mail.
8/10/1999	Corrections	An article about the growth and prospects of America Online in the Money & Business section on July 4 imprecisely summarized a comment by Stephen M. Case, the company's chairman. As Mr. Case informed The Times yesterday, he was describing the view put forward by Microsoft's lawyers in recent antitrust litigation, not expressing his own view, when he said: ''Windows is the past. In the future, AOL is the next Microsoft.'' Mr. Case's view is that personal computers will continue to be the predominant Internet access device and that Windows will continue to be the predominant operating system.
8/9/1999	Investigator Of Microsoft Unrelenting In His Pursuit	The marquee stars of the Government's antitrust assault on the Microsoft Corporation have been David Boies, the trial lawyer who proved a master at catching Microsoft witnesses off-guard, and Joel I. Klein, the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division. Yet the outcome of the Government's case -- win or lose -- will largely hinge on whether the Federal courts are impressed by the work and judgment of Phillip R. Malone.
8/9/1999	Venture Offers Outsourcing For All Computer Services	For every small business owner who has struggled with personal computers that crash, printers that won't print and networks that don't network, Sheldon Laube says he has the answer. His new company, Centerbeam Inc., will offer complete outsourcing of information technology, all for a single monthly per-user fee. Mr. Laube, the co-founder of U.S. Web Inc. and former chief technology officer for Novell Inc. and Price Waterhouse, said Centerbeam would offer the first truly ''free'' PC, as in free of hassles.
8/7/1999	Microsoft Issues a First Repair For Office 97 Security Flaw	The Microsoft Corporation released a partial corrective yesterday for a dangerous lapse in security. The flaw appears when the company's Office 97 group of programs is installed with most versions of Internet Explorer, Microsoft's Web browser. Microsoft programmed the browser to trust all files created by its Office programs, and it is possible that an intruder could create a malicious program that masqueraded as an Office file -- a Word, Excel or Powerpoint document -- and plant it on a World Wide Web site or in an E-mail message.
8/3/1999	Scramble to Fix Computer Security Flaws	Three giants of the computer industry Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer -- found themselves scrambling today to address a rash of serious security vulnerabilities in software designed to interact with Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser. The flaws, first made public last week, are particularly insidious because they allow intruders to plant malicious programs on a computer merely by sending an E-mail message or by luring a victim to a malicious Web page that automatically plants a file on the visitor's hard drive.
8/2/1999	Fewer Computer Users Give Microsoft a Positive Rating	The company is thriving, the shareholders are rich and its name is synonymous with high technology and success. But is the Microsoft Corporation's sterling image losing some of its luster? That is the question posed, at least, by the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
8/2/1999	A Showdown On Messaging May Unite Web Users	For more than a week, the Microsoft Corporation and America Online Inc. have engaged in a public spat over open access to the instant-message systems that have become increasingly popular on the Internet. Despite their rhetoric, though, neither company has much of a track record for making it easy for competitors to gain access to the markets that America Online and Microsoft hold dear.
7/31/1999	Security Flaws In Software Are Reported	Microsoft and Compaq Computer yesterday acknowledged several significant software security flaws that could enable intruders to gain access to the computers of millions of customers and to damage their data via E-mail or through commands sent from a malicious Web site. Certain Hewlett-Packard computers are also said by one expert to be vulnerable, but a spokesman for the company said yesterday that the company would not confirm the security vulnerability.
7/29/1999	Senior Microsoft Executive To Leave Management Job	Paul Maritz, a senior executive at the Microsoft Corporation, is returning to his roots as a programmer as part of the company's campaign to persuade software developers to continue to rely on its technology despite the rise of the Internet. In an internal E-mail to colleagues on Tuesday, Mr. Maritz, a group vice president, said he was handing off most of his day-to-day management duties to work more closely with William H. Gates, the chairman, to help ''set technical direction in the company'' and ''to educate myself on the details of technologies that I have not had the chance to be as 'hands on' as I would have liked over the last several years.''
7/28/1999	Positions Harden in Instant-Message Fight	Hostilities continued yesterday in the bitter debate about whether Microsoft should be able to link into America Online's popular instant message system, with Microsoft rebuffing America Online's invitation to discuss a possible deal. The dispute broke out last week when the Microsoft Corporation introduced new software that lets users send instant messages both to users of Microsoft's Hotmail service and to users of the America Online service as well as others who use the AOL Instant Messenger, or AIM, software. America Online said that Microsoft was acting like a hacker, connecting to its system without authorization.
7/26/1999	JOE HILL IN HIGH TECH: A special report.; Unions Need Not Apply	As the labor movement sets its sights on the booming high-technology world, employees like Matt Shea, a 24-year-old software developer, seem ripe for the picking. He often clocks 70-hour weeks, his managers sometimes push him to work past midnight, and he never receives overtime pay. But ask Mr. Shea whether he wants a union at his workplace, a thriving Internet start-up called Go2Net, and his response is a puzzled expression that says ''Does Not Compute.''
7/24/1999	In Cyberspace, Rivals Skirmish Over Messaging	America Online closed its on-line service yesterday to new software from two of its fiercest rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, that had been designed to tap into one of America Online's most popular features: instant messages. On Thursday, both the Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo introduced software that could send messages to some 40 million users of AOL Instant Messaging, a program that enables people to hold ''real time'' dialogues. Unlike standard E-mail, which arrives in a recipient's in-box to be read only when it is opened, instant-messaging software places a message in an open window on the recipient's computer screen seconds after it is transmitted.
7/23/1999	Microsoft Tells Analysts The Future Is Good, Sort Of	In summing up its year for financial analysts and investors today, a supremely confident Microsoft Corporation gave few indications that it felt embattled in its legal struggle with the Justice Department over antitrust issues. In fact, it defiantly asserted that these are the best of times for the PC industry. At its annual meeting for analysts, the company has traditionally warned Wall Street of potential doom and gloom on the horizon. But this year, on the heels of a fourth-quarter report showing overall margins of about 38 percent, the usual warnings seemed to lack conviction.
7/21/1999	CORBIS AND PICTURE PRESS TEAM UP IN EUROPEAN VENTURE	The Corbis Corporation, owned by William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, has formed an alliance with Picture Press, based in Hamburg, Germany, to sell pictures in Austria and Germany. Seattle-based Corbis, the world's largest image archive, will license 2.1 million digital images to Picture Press, a unit of the closely held Gruner & Jahr Publishing House. Corbis has 65 million pictures by the photographer Ansel Adams and news photographers from United Press International and other agencies, as well as fine art. Corbis, which will market to commercial clients like public relations firms and advertising agencies, acquired Sygma of France last month to supplant Getty Images Inc. as the No. 1 picture collection.
7/21/1999	Microsoft Is No Spain	To the Editor: A July 17 Business Day article on Microsoft's $500 billion market value says that if Microsoft were a country, its gross national product would rank right behind Spain's, the ninth-largest economy in the world. This is misleading and only feeds the hype surrounding Microsoft and Internet stocks.
7/19/1999	Microsoft Set to Sell City Guides to Rival	In what would be a major consolidation in on-line city guides, the Microsoft Corporation is on the verge of selling MSN Sidewalk to Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch in a stock transaction worth $240 million, people close to the negotiations said yesterday. Under the deal, Microsoft would also acquire a 9 percent stake in Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch, with the option to increase that stake to 13 percent.
7/17/1999	Gates Hits $100 Billion Mark, More or Less	Last month, in the largest gift ever by a living person to a charitable foundation, William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, donated $5 billion to support education and health care causes. Yesterday, in a few hours of stock market trading, Mr. Gates's holdings surged by just about that amount, brushing $100 billion for the first time.
7/17/1999	CONNECTICUT CASE FAVORS MICROSOFT	It was a David versus Goliath case, a courtroom confrontation between a struggling little software maker and the mighty Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft was accused of befriending the fledgling company when it suited its interests and then callously casting the company aside when it was no longer useful, denying it access to Microsoft's technology on fair terms. The tactic, the plaintiff's lawyers argued, was a violation of Federal antitrust laws and all but a death sentence for Bristol Technology Inc. of Danbury, Conn.
7/15/1999	Windows In Your Pocket	If the Microsoft Corporation is to sustain its dominance of the software industry in the 21st century, it must spread its Windows software far beyond desktop and portable computers and into our television sets, our automobiles, our telephones and even into our pockets. But not even Captain Kangaroo could fit the forthcoming Windows 2000, with 50 million lines of computer code, into his pocket.
7/15/1999	In Defense of Windows	To the Editor: Ah, yes, the pattern continues: The New York Times publishes an article dealing with any sort of difficulty using a Windows PC (in this case, ''Agony, Ecstasy, Agony: Enter the Computer,'' July 1). The next week, it publishes the deluge of letters from its readers extolling the virtues of the Macintosh, particularly how easy it is to set up.
7/13/1999	MICROSOFT TAKES CANADIAN STAKE	The Microsoft Corporation agreed to invest $407 million in Rogers Communications Inc. of Toronto, which owns Canada's largest cable TV company. Microsoft will develop software for Rogers to allow customers to link their TV sets to the Internet. Rogers had an operating loss last year and has $3.7 billion of debt. The class B shares of Rogers gained 81.25 cents, to $20.875. Timothy Pritchard
7/11/1999	Antitrust In the Slow Lane	THE outcome of the Government's suit against Microsoft, filed 14 months ago, is still far from certain, and the endgame may be two or three years away, after appeals that may well reach the Supreme Court. But one byproduct is already evident: a policy debate over whether the current system of antitrust enforcement, dating back to John D. Rockefeller and the railway barons, is up to the challenge of policing corporate behavior in a modern, high-technology economy.
7/9/1999	Corrections	A report in the Compressed Data column of Business Day on Monday about a wearable computer made by a group of high school students from Dearborn, Mich., misspelled the surname of a Microsoft executive who had seen it. He is Anthony J. Bay, not Bray.
7/7/1999	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: A Media World to Conquer; In Europe, Giants Are on the Rise	Europe's television industry is suddenly in the grip of an American-style consolidation. Encouraged by the forces of the global economy and the power of the Internet, European media companies are forging cross-border links, and American giants like the Microsoft Corporation are buying into the action. The resulting corporate alliances are providing a gateway for advertisers to reach wider mass audiences and an opportunity for Europe to challenge America's supremacy in television programming.
7/6/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Cnet is singed by the offbeat logic of the Internet investor.	CNET was one of the very first companies to build a business on the World Wide Web, but it has rarely benefited from the special dispensations that investors accord most Internet companies. Look, for example, at how the market reacted when Real Networks, another of the oldest Web concerns, announced a deal with the WebTV unit of the Microsoft Corporation on Thursday. Though the deal will bring in no revenue for Real, its stock reacted with the usual E-euphoria, surging 27 percent in two days, to $89.94.
7/6/1999	A Pragmatist on What Computers Can Do	In eight books, Dr. Michael L. Dertouzos -- engineer, inventor, theoretician and director of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- predicted the many ways the information revolution would affect human lives. In the 1970's, he forecast that one-third of all American homes would soon have personal computers. In 1980, he announced the coming of a worldwide Internet culture. Indeed, it was under Dr. Dertouzos' directorship of the Laboratory for Computer Science that Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.
7/4/1999	Now, AOL Everywhere	OVER the last year, the walls of America Online's rapidly expanding headquarters here have been dotted with plaques declaring the company's mission: ''To build a global medium as central to people's lives as the telephone or television . . . and even more valuable.'' But wait. Aren't telephones everywhere? And don't Americans watch seven hours of TV each day? How can Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, dare to think that his company -- which just a few years ago lurched from one crisis to the next and was largely a chat service for lonely teen-agers -- belongs in the same league?
7/2/1999	Web Concession From Microsoft	In a symbolic concession that it cannot control all facets of Internet technology, the Microsoft Corporation has agreed to license the latest audio and video player from Real Networks rather than favor its own less popular competing product. Real Networks developed the Real Audio and Real Video formats that Internet services use to put sound and video clips on their Web sites. Microsoft's competing technology is the Windows Media Player.
7/1/1999	Microsoft's Accounting Under Scrutiny	The Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company's accounting practices involving the stating of financial reserves. Industry experts said the S.E.C. investigation could be part of its effort to restrain ''cookie jar'' accounting, which can smooth over differences between strong and weak quarters. Microsoft has consistently denied any such intent and insists that it has adhered to ''conservative'' accounting practices.
7/1/1999	Technological Pioneering, Past and Present	HOW THE WEB WAS WON: MICROSOFT FROM WINDOWS TO THE WEB By Paul Andrews (Broadway Books, 1999; $27.50). WHEN all is said and done, the story of the computer industry, the Internet and the World Wide Web may well turn out to be as painstakingly chronicled as World War II. Every few months, another book appears, focusing on this or that aspect of the digital revolution.
6/30/1999	Microsoft Offer On Net Service	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software maker, is offering new subscribers who sign up for its MSN Internet access service a $400 credit to buy a personal computer. The offer is available through Staples Inc. stores and Microcenter stores, an MSN customer service representative said. Microcenter is a small consumer-electronics chain based in Ohio. Consumers must sign up for MSN for three years as part of the promotion, according to a Staples salesman. MSN's ISP service costs $19.95 a month.
6/28/1999	Microsoft, Running Scared	Op-Ed article by Ronald A Cass, dean of Boston University Law School and consultant to Microsoft Corp, contends that in nine months since Microsoft trial began, Government has not proved that Microsoft has violated antitrust laws by harming customers; maintains that it is time for Justice Department to give up yet another misguided effort to micromanage fast-moving information-technology business (M)
6/28/1999	Brazilians Take to the Web With Uncommon Speed	Pierre Schurmann, one of Brazil's Internet barons, did not know things would develop so fast. Three years ago, Mr. Schurmann, 30, founded Zeek, a popular search engine. Earlier this year, he sold Zeek to the Star Media Network, a company that was formed to seek out Internet opportunities in Latin America, and became director of new business development in Brazil. Then Star Media went public with a stock offering on Nasdaq.
6/25/1999	As Testimony Ends, Microsoft's Judge Waits for Motions	The heated accusations of monopoly, the lively E-mail flavored with capitalist aggression and the spirited testimony alleging and denying misconduct came to a close today as the last witness stepped off the stand in the Microsoft antitrust trial, eight months after proceedings began. The trial is by no means over, but it will sharply shift gears as the daily theater in the courtroom gives way to a more sober weighing of facts and law. ''Now the showmanship ends and the legal maneuvering really begins,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a Howard University law professor.
6/25/1999	Microsoft in Deal for Swedish Company	Skandia Insurance A.B., the top insurer in Scandinavia, said today that it had accepted a bid from the Microsoft Corporation of 1.1 billion kronor ($130 million) for Sendit A.B., a Swedish software maker, paving the way for a takeover. Earlier this month, Skandia raised its stake in Sendit to 20 percent, double the 10 percent needed to block a takeover under Swedish law. Last month Sendit urged shareholders to accept Microsoft's bid of 325 kronor a share, at the time a 41 percent premium. Skandia now owns 20.9 percent of Sendit.
6/25/1999	SOFTBANK VENTURES	Japan's Internet powerhouse, the Softbank Corporation, said it would set up two on-line businesses in toys and investment advice, along with three new venture capital funds that could invest up to $1.6 billion in start-ups in the country's fledgling Internet industry. Softbank is teaming with the Bandai Company, Yahoo Japan and five others to sell toys on line and will be joined by the Microsoft Corporation, Directadvice.com and other companies in offering financial advice to investors.

6/25/1999	Gates Memo Deals a Blow To Microsoft	The absent star made a final appearance in the Microsoft antitrust trial today when a Government lawyer introduced as evidence a comment by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, that knocked the legs from under his legal team's most important defensive strategy. Mr. Gates has not appeared as a witness at his company's trial. Nonetheless, he has exerted tremendous influence on the proceedings -- most often in a manner that helped the Government make its case.
6/25/1999	Game Blocker To Be Installed On Windows	The Microsoft Corporation plans to introduce a feature in its Windows operating system allowing users to determine what kinds of games can be played on the computer. Such a feature could enable parents to keep a game with gruesome violence, offensive language or nudity from being played, based on the game's content rating. The option, to be included in the next release of Windows, will be similar to a feature on Microsoft's Web browser that can be used to block access to some sites, said Kevin Bachus, a multimedia group product manager at Microsoft.
6/24/1999	Microsoft's Final Witness Is Questioned on Payments	A Government lawyer began cross-examination of Microsoft's final witness in its antitrust trial today and quickly prompted him to disclose that Microsoft had paid about $250,000 for his testimony and related work. The witness was Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Microsoft's expert economist for the trial. He said that over the last two years he has charged Microsoft $800 an hour for his trial work. In addition, the private company through which he bills Microsoft paid him a $200,000 bonus last year, double that of the previous year, presumably because of the Microsoft income.
6/24/1999	Pitfalls of Office 2000	To the Editor: Was ''Office 2000 Is Well Connected'' (June 10) supposed to be a review of Office 2000? There are glaring problems with the 97/98 (Windows and Mac) versions of the software suite: weird corrections like capitalizing letters, automatic outlining that doesn't quite work, inaccurate rendering of HTML with tables, Powerpoint's lack of layout flexibility. So what about Office 2000? Your reviewer doesn't really address whether these problems still exist, but one has suspicions. And what about the competitors, mentioned in the last sentence of the article? Does Word Perfect even exist any more? Are there other competitors of note?
6/23/1999	Microsoft's Final Witness Asked to Rebut U.S. Case	A Microsoft lawyer today led the company's final witness at its antitrust trial through the long chain of charges that the Government has thrown at Microsoft through eight months of trial and asked him to rebut each of them. Not surprisingly, the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Microsoft's expert economist, agreed that there was no substance to any of the charges.
6/22/1999	Microsoft's Final Antitrust Case Witness Stumbles a Bit	The Microsoft Corporation's final witness testified today that in his view of the world, the very actions that landed the company in court on antitrust charges have greatly benefited consumers, computer manufacturers and every company that is doing business on the Internet. Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the last witness in the long- running antitrust trial, and the company is trying to use his testimony to rebut each of the principal charges the Government has raised in the last eight months.
6/22/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Fund's Quick Slide From First to (Almost) Worst	In April, Janus 20 sat atop the mutual fund world. It was the best performer of any large stock fund, having doubled investors' money since the start of 1998. And it had taken in so much money so fast -- nearly $7 billion in four months -- that Janus said it would close the fund to ''deliver superior performance.'' Now, the fund has once more earned a prominent place on the performance charts -- this time, at the bottom. In fact, through Thursday, it ranked as the 15th-worst-performing general equity fund of 4,008 funds in the second quarter, according to Lipper, the Summit, N.J., mutual fund data company.
6/21/1999	Potential Rival Remains Wary of Microsoft's Power	As Stephen M. Case, chief executive of America Online, contemplated making the biggest deal of his career -- the purchase of Netscape Communications -- he stopped for a moment last fall to ponder whether his company could finally afford to dump Microsoft. Two years earlier, America Online executives were thinking they had no choice but to use the Microsoft Corporation's browser instead of Netscape's as the default for their millions of customers. Microsoft had made an offer they could not refuse -- a high-profile spot on the Windows desktop.
6/21/1999	Programmers, Start Your Laptops; Software Wizards Test Their Wits Chasing Puzzles From Brooklyn to Putnam	When the custodial worker at the World Trade Center Marriott found a bottle of green liquid labeled Caution: Radioactive Material yesterday, he did the only responsible thing: notified security officials, who evacuated the entire 14th floor. How were they to know that it was only Palmolive dish detergent? After all, they were not in the Game.
6/20/1999	When Cyberspace Was a State of Mind	In 1996, when TNT first approached him about doing a television movie on the history of the personal computer industry, Martyn Burke brushed off the suggestion. ''I told them I'd rather do a history of cornflakes,'' recalled Mr. Burke, a screenwriter, novelist and documentary filmmaker. A rich history perhaps, he figured, but how do you tell a technology story to a mainstream audience? No life-and-death drama, no love story and far too much nerdish widgetry to slog through.
6/18/1999	A Couple of Nerds Trying to Take Over the World	The swashbuckling title ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is absolutely right for a film about the birth of the computer age. After all, the tale of the battle for dominance between Apple Computers and Microsoft is brimming with those age-old elements of high drama: invention, big bucks and backbiting. Apple's founder, Steve Jobs (savvily played by Noah Wyle), is the visionary and rebel here, as comfortable with cosmic consciousness as bytes of information. ''It's better to be a pirate than to run the navy,'' he tells his employees.
6/18/1999	Are 'Viruses' Naughty by Nature?	To the Editor: Re ''Illness as a Metaphor for Computer Bugs'' (news article, June 14):
6/18/1999	After five years of high points and low, Microsoft drops Wieden & Kennedy for McCann-Erickson.	A FIVE-YEAR relationship between the Microsoft Corporation and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., ended abruptly yesterday, as Microsoft dismissed the agency and shifted its corporate brand account, with billings estimated at $100 million, to McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, a newcomer to the company's roster. Wieden & Kennedy, best known for its clever campaigns for Nike Inc., had once been Microsoft's principal American agency. It created Microsoft's first-ever brand campaigns, image-polishing ads that appeared on television, in print and on the Internet carrying the theme ''Where do you want to go to today?''
6/17/1999	Microsoft Calls Its Own Character Witness	At its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corporation today presented its leading character witness, a folksy, plain-spoken industry veteran who delivered a message that pleased Microsoft's lawyers but will surely make its marketing executives cringe. In testimony that traced his 25 years in the business, Gordon E. Eubanks Jr. portrayed the software business as an entrepreneurial hotbed, fast changing and fluid, where today's dominant company can quickly become tomorrow's also-ran.
6/16/1999	Gates Testifies, and the Republicans Seek to Forge Closer Links	Al Gore may not have invented the Internet, but he and President Clinton have honed their skills of extracting political contributions from Silicon Valley. Now, in a three-day ''High Tech Summit'' on Capitol Hill, Republicans are trying to show that they have the capacity to be even better friends of William H. Gates and his competitors. This morning, Mr. Gates -- his once-sharp barbs about Washington lawmakers replaced with such deferential comments as ''you've raised an interesting issue, Senator'' -- was filled with prognostications about how the Web, wireless networks and electronic commerce would turn ''consumers into big winners.''
6/15/1999	Microsoft Witness Keeps People Off Edges of Their Seats	The Microsoft Corporation put its most important rebuttal witness in the Government's antitrust trial on the stand today, a senior executive from America Online, and set out to prove that the on-line service had deceived the judge about its plans to compete with Microsoft. But the effort proved to be a bust in terms of how it played in court.
6/15/1999	Corbis to Acquire A Photo Agency	The Corbis Corporation, a privately held company that is wholly owned by William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, said today that it had agreed to acquire Sygma, one of the world's largest news photography agencies, as part of its plan to offer news and celebrity images to publishers and consumers over the Internet. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Corbis management said the acquisition of Sygma would add about 200 employees to its existing staff of 600. Sygma, which maintains offices in Paris, London and New York, also has about 500 photographers under contract around the world, and regularly buys photos from about 5,000 others.
6/12/1999	Companies Marshal Defense Against Computer 'Worm'	Large corporations worldwide scrambled yesterday to halt the spread of a malicious computer program that began infecting computers in Israel on Monday and spread rapidly to Europe and the United States, carried by E-mail. The program, a computer attack known as a worm, destroys documents created by several widely used Microsoft programs, including Word and Excel.
6/11/1999	Microsoft Again Duels With Web Browser Witness	With the Government's final witness on the stand in Federal court this afternoon, lawyers for the Microsoft Corporation were obviously eager for an opportunity to mount a demonstration of how it was impossible to remove the company's World Wide Web browser from its Windows 98 operating system. ''The demonstration is so dramatic that I think you will appreciate it,'' Steven Holley, a Microsoft lawyer, told a clearly amused Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
6/11/1999	New Infection Kills Software Through E-Mail	Computer researchers today reported a malicious computer program that is spreading rapidly through the Internet by E-mail and destroying documents created by widely used Microsoft software programs. Several large corporations, including Boeing, AT&T and General Electric, said their computers had been infected and moved to limit the damage, in some cases by shutting down their E-mail systems. Employees of Microsoft, Intel and the anti-virus software maker Symantec said they had also been hit.
6/10/1999	Microsoft Trial Witness Undergoes Tough Cross-Examination	Under sharp questioning by a Microsoft lawyer, an I.B.M. executive conceded today that none of the Microsoft contract proposals he read had stated that I.B.M. must stop shipping its OS/2 operating system to get a favorable price for Windows, Microsoft's competing operating system. But Garry Norris of the International Business Machines Corporation testified that despite the absence of a clear-cut requirement that I.B.M. drop its operating system, the many sales and promotion steps called for in the Microsoft proposal would have had the ''effect of killing OS/2 in the marketplace.''
6/10/1999	Office 2000 Is Well Connected	OFFICE 2000, which hit the shelves this week, is a complete overhaul of Microsoft's suite of so-called productivity applications and offers many new features -- and, predictably, a few new irritations. But its most remarkable innovation is the way the entire family of applications seamlessly interacts with the Internet, in essence recasting cyberspace as the World Wide Hard Drive. Looking at the software strictly from a user's standpoint, the change is definitely for the better. After four months of playing with Office 2000, it's clear that not only is it an improvement, but it makes excellent use of Microsoft's integration of its Web browser into the Windows 98 operating system.
6/9/1999	Microsoft-Sprint Deal on Data System	The Microsoft Corporation is working with the Sprint Corporation to combine phone and data services on a single computer for small businesses, Microsoft announced. The companies plan to begin selling systems this summer that manage phone services like local, wireless and Internet access and also include voice mail and E-mail. The computers will also be able to handle other business applications, like accounting, Steve Ballmer, the president of Microsoft, said in a speech at the Supercomm '99 trade show in Atlanta.
6/9/1999	MICROSOFT AND INPRISE REACH $125 MILLION AGREEMENT	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had paid $125 million for a stake in the Inprise Corporation, the rights to use the software developer's technology and a settlement of longstanding patent and technology issues. The agreement between the two companies included a $25 million purchase by Microsoft of preferred stock in Inprise, which was formerly known as Borland International Inc. Microsoft, which did not disclose the issues that were being settled, said it had also paid Inprise $100 million to use Inprise-patented technology in its products. Shares of Inprise rose $1.125, to $5.125.
6/9/1999	I.B.M. Executive Testifies On '97 Microsoft Proposal	At a private meeting in March 1997, a Microsoft executive told I.B.M. that the computer maker would pay a lower price for Microsoft's Windows operating system if it did not ship a competing Internet browser, an I.B.M. executive testified today. With his handwritten notes of the meeting introduced as evidence in the Microsoft antitrust trial, Garry Norris of the International Business Machines Corporation recounted the meeting and the proposal by an executive of the Microsoft Corporation.
6/8/1999	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Friday about the Federal antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation referred incorrectly to the Thursday testimony of a Government witness, Franklin M. Fisher. Reacting to an apparent conflict between the testimony of a previous witness, James Barksdale of the Netscape Communications Corporation, and internal company documents, Mr. Fisher said he thought the documents were exaggerations; he did not say Mr. Barksdale had exaggerated.
6/8/1999	I.B.M. Official Has Harsh Words for Microsoft	Referring to documents and recalling first-hand experience, an I.B.M. executive today provided the most detailed allegations yet to arise in the Microsoft antitrust trial of how the big software maker wielded its market power to put pressure on personal computer makers to favor Microsoft's products. The executive, Garry Norris, testified that when he objected to the price and terms under which Microsoft offered its industry-standard Windows operating system to the International Business Machines Corporation, he heard the take-it-or-leave-it arrogance of a monopolist.
6/7/1999	Compressed Data; Microsoft Research Chief Admits He's 'Being Selfish'	The wry joke making the rounds in the computer industry asks why Nathan Myhrvold needs to leave Microsoft to pursue his scientific research. After all, the joke goes, he's just going off to study predators. The bearded chief technology officer of the Microsoft Corporation is usually quick to laugh, but he just wearily rolls his eyes at what he doubtless regards as simply another lame manifestation of Microsoft bashing. Besides, he takes his predators seriously.
6/7/1999	Microsoft Binds Office Software More Tightly to Internet	The Microsoft Corporation's power and influence in the computer industry stems not only from its dominant Windows operating system, but also from its office productivity software. And on Monday, Microsoft will announce that it has begun retail shipments of a new version of its office productivity ''suite,'' Office 2000, that all but eliminates the distinctions between a PC document and Internet data. Office 2000, which includes word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, data base, E-mail, scheduling and other software functions, has a long list of new features -- almost all of which are intended to give PC users a set of software tools that deeply integrate Internet capabilities.
6/7/1999	Microsoft to Offer Rebuttal On I.B.M. Executive's Charge	In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corporation is expected to introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by an I.B.M. executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if I.B.M. agreed to ''eliminate or drop'' its competing operating system, OS/2. The allegation was made last month by Garry Norris, a manager who negotiated with Microsoft for the International Business Machines Corporation's personal computer business. He is scheduled to take the stand today as a witness for the Government.
6/5/1999	Microsoft Undercut in Effort To Depict Rival as Thriving	Trying to defang the Government's antitrust charges against it, the Microsoft Corporation introduced a host of evidence this week to show that the Netscape browser was still healthy and thriving, despite Microsoft's all-out assault on the browser market. But in a single stroke this afternoon, a Government lawyer undercut Microsoft's strategy by producing a Microsoft E-mail written in January suggesting that the company had cynically and selectively produced data to support this point of view.
6/4/1999	Netscape Chief's Testimony Is Re-examined by Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation promised it would question the credibility of key Justice Department witnesses during the rebuttal phase of the antitrust trial that began this week, and today a company lawyer introduced several documents that did just that. The apparent inconsistencies between a Government witness's testimony last fall and subsequent statements out of court caught the attention of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson -- so much so that the judge urged a Government attorney to take account of them in court on Friday.
6/3/1999	Gateses Give Record $5 Billion Gift to Foundation	In what is considered the largest gift ever by a living person to a foundation, the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates, and his wife, Melinda French Gates, today announced a gift of $5 billion to the William H. Gates Foundation. The couple's philanthropies now rank third among United States foundations, if the $1.3 billion assets of the Gates Learning Foundation are added. Only the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, with $12.2 billion, and the Lily Endowment, with $12 billion, are larger, according to June figures from The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper based in Washington.
6/3/1999	Microsoft Attempts to Show It Had 'Scary' Competition	The Microsoft Corporation once again tried to show in court today that the company was facing potentially lethal competition, even presenting as evidence an E-mail message from one of its employees who called the competitive situation ''a very scary thing.'' But as a Microsoft lawyer, Michael Lacovara, tried to make the case that the personal computer business was seriously threatened, he first had to get past comments Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, made in an interview published by Newsweek magazine last month.
6/2/1999	F.T.C. Ending Inquiry Into Cisco Systems' Partnership Talks	The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that it was ending its nine-month investigation into partnership discussions that Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of data communications equipment, held in recent years with two rivals, Lucent Technologies Inc. and the Nortel Networks Corporation of Canada. The inquiry's end means that for the time being, Cisco will escape the sort of regulatory and legal pressure that the Government has brought to bear on two other titans of cyberspace, the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation.
6/2/1999	After Three-Month Recess, Microsoft Trial Resumes	After a three-month recess and unsuccessful efforts to reach a settlement, the rebuttal phase of the Microsoft antitrust trial opened today with a concerted attack on the previous testimony of the company's chief economic witness. In the attack, Franklin M. Fisher, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is testifying on behalf of the Government for the second time, called the economic analysis of Richard L. Schmalensee, his former student and a fellow economist at M.I.T., ''peculiar,'' ''ridiculous,'' ''credulous'' and naive.
6/1/1999	Chief Technology Officer At Microsoft Takes a Leave	Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer, will take a yearlong sabbatical to pursue his own scientific research and travel, the company announced today. Microsoft made the announcement after several news organizations, including Time magazine, reported that Mr. Myhrvold was leaving after a falling out with Microsoft's president, Steven A. Ballmer.
5/31/1999	New Company Getting Capital For Web Video	The Dell Computer Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation have invested in Digital Entertainment Network, a start-up company developing youth-oriented television programming for delivery over the Internet. The investments are part of $26 million in venture capital investments set to be announced this week. Other investors are Cassandra Chase Entertainment Partners, Chase Capital Partners and senior executives of Lazard Freres & Company, according to Digital Entertainment, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif. The size of each investment was not disclosed.
5/31/1999	In an Antitrust Suit, a Tiny Ex-Partner Is Taking Aim at Microsoft	As the trial in the Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation resumes on Tuesday in Washington, evidence in a separate trial set to open this week in Connecticut seems to offer tantalizing support for an assertion that the company's rivals have made for years -- that Microsoft wields its industry-standard Windows operating system as a club to control the software business. Central to the Connecticut case is an issue that has been raised peripherally by several Government witnesses in the Washington case -- how Microsoft controls its competitors' understanding of application program interfaces, or A.P.I.'s.
5/29/1999	U.S. Hunts for Quid Pro Quo In Microsoft Witness's Actions	The Justice Department's chief trial lawyer in the Government's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation closely questioned a Microsoft witness today about whether he had benefited as a result of his decision to defend the company and to testify in its behalf. The questioning was one of a series of depositions taking place in preparation for the resumption of the trial in Washington on Tuesday.
5/28/1999	I.B.M. Executive Describes Price Pressure by Microsoft	A senior I.B.M. executive testified today that the Microsoft Corporation had repeatedly raised the prices it charged the International Business Machines Corporation for its Windows operating system and had enforced other onerous licensing terms in retaliation for I.B.M.'s refusal to stop competing with Microsoft. ''Microsoft repeatedly said we would suffer in terms of prices, terms, conditions and support programs, as long as we were offering competing products,'' said the executive, Garry Norris, a manager in I.B.M.'s PC division from 1995 through 1997.
5/28/1999	McCann-Erickson Gets Windows Account	The Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash., said yesterday that it had named McCann-Erickson North America as agency of record for the Windows operating system in the United States, effective July 1. Spending has not been determined pending planning to introduce Windows 2000; spending for previous versions of Windows ranged from $10 million to $100 million. The New York and San Francisco offices of McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of McCann-Erickson World Group, will work in partnership with the San Francisco office of Anderson & Lembke, which handles other tasks for Microsoft. Both agencies are owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. Other big recent McCann-Erickson gains include DuPont, Lowe's and Sprint.
5/26/1999	Cable Deal For $3.6 Billion Is Expected	Charter Communications Inc., the cable-television operator owned by Paul G. Allen, one of the co-founders of the Microsoft Corporation, is expected to announce as early as today that it is buying the cable assets of Falcon Cable Holdings of Los Angeles in a stock swap valued at more than $3.6 billion, people close to the talks said. Executives at both companies have been in talks for only a few weeks, these people said. Mr. Allen is also negotiating to acquire the assets of two other smaller cable companies.
5/24/1999	Bertelsmann Chief Pushes Public Growth	In a drive to become a dominant force in the digital world and take advantage of investor enthusiasm for Internet stocks, the sprawling media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G. is laying plans to take more of its on-line operations public. Bertelsmann is already expected to offer stock later this week in its on-line bookselling joint venture with Barnes & Noble Inc., Barnesandnoble.com. And it has announced plans to issue shares in its Berlin-based Web site and software design concern, Pixelpark. But those only presage other Bertelsmann stock offerings in coming months, according to Thomas Middelhoff, the company's chief executive and chairman.
5/22/1999	Depositions Continue in Microsoft Case	Midway through a deposition today, Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, looked quizzically at the Microsoft lawyer who was questioning him and asked, ''Did I wander into the wrong room?'' The Microsoft Corporation deposed Mr. Case this morning as part of its preparations for the rebuttal phase of the antitrust trial against the software giant, which is scheduled to resume June 1 after a three-month recess. Many of the questions centered on America Online's Internet business strategy, leading Mr. Case to wonder aloud what on earth any of it had to do with the anticompetitive charges against Microsoft that are at issue in the case.
5/21/1999	Medical Records Company Announces Spree of Deals	The Healtheon Corporation, a rapidly growing Silicon Valley start-up with big ideas for changing the health care system, said yesterday that it would buy WebMD Inc., a seven-month-old Internet company, in a stock deal valued at $7.85 billion. Healtheon is also allying itself with some of technology's best-known names, selling $250 million of its high-flying stock to the Microsoft Corporation and $110 million to other backers including the Intel Corporation and Excite Inc., the Internet portal company.
5/20/1999	AT&T RAISES ESTIMATE FOR PROFIT AFTER BUYING MEDIAONE	The AT&T Corporation expects its acquisition of Mediaone Group to cut profit by about half as much as previously estimated because of lower borrowing costs and a $5 billion investment from the Microsoft Corporation. AT&T expects the purchase to reduce earnings next year by about 9 percent, or 15 cents to 16 cents a share. It expects to earn $2.11 to $2.15 a share after including the effect of its purchase of Mediaone, AT&T's chief financial officer, Daniel Somers, said. AT&T agreed to buy Mediaone, the No. 4 United States cable-television provider, earlier this month for about $62.5 billion in a move to become the largest United States cable-TV provider. At the time, AT&T said the purchase could reduce 2000 earnings by as much as 30 cents a share.
5/20/1999	Microsoft Head Gives $5 Million to Charities	The chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, William H. Gates, and his wife, Melinda, donated $5 million yesterday to help charities hurt by the collapse of the United Way of Santa Clara County, Calif., which gave away more money than it took in until it went broke on May 1. The Gateses, long supporters of the United Way in Seattle, 700 miles north of Santa Clara County, made their gift through the Community Foundation Silicon Valley, which will distribute the money to more than 100 charities, but not the failed United Way itself.
5/20/1999	A Race to the Wireless; British Company Seeks Lead in Smart-Phone Software	A visitor to the Psion plant here was inquiring recently about the competition facing the company, which is best known in Britain for its palm-size organizers. ''Well,'' one top executive replied, ''there's a guy on the West Coast of the U.S.A. . . .'' To American ears, that might have sounded like a coy reference to the 3Com Corporation, based in California's Silicon Valley. 3Com makes the Palm Pilot family of personal organizers, which soundly trounced Psion's products in the United States, though Psion (pronounced SY-on) claims 59 percent of the European market.
5/19/1999	Xerox-Microsoft Deal Links Variety of Technologies	Xerox and Microsoft today announced an alliance aimed at bridging the worlds of paper documents and computers. As part of the new relationship the Microsoft Corporation will license a Web surfing technology developed at the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, and Xerox will incorporate Embedded NT, a version of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, in a future generation of its high-end copying systems.
5/18/1999	AT&T Digital Music Unit Loses More Than Half of Its Workers	In a blow to AT&T's efforts on the digital music frontier, more than half the employees of its A2B music initiative are leaving the company to join another venture. The 14 who are leaving include Larry Miller and Howie Singer, co-founders of A2B, which was established 18 months ago and developed a digital format for transmitting music over the Internet. The group will join Reciprocal Inc., a privately held company that creates software for managing rights to digitally distributed material, where they will start a new division dedicated to music. Microsoft invested $15 million in Reciprocal in March.
5/16/1999	The Nation: AT&T's Merger Deals; Hold on. Maybe We'll Connect You.	THE antitrust authorities barely whimpered last month when AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance company, acquired Tele-Communications Inc., the second-largest cable company. The deal advanced AT&T's audacious plan to feed phone calls and Internet data over the same wire that carries video channels -- offering customers a svelte package of every electronic service they can imagine. And this month AT&T moved to buy another large cable company, Mediaone, and to bring Microsoft into its cable and Internet operations. C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&T, predicts little regulatory interference. And who knows? He may be right. Fifteen years after the Government split AT&T into pieces -- and even as it is asking the courts to break Microsoft's stranglehold over personal computing -- these two giants nevertheless are rushing to dominate phone, cable and Internet service.
5/14/1999	Temporary Microsoft Workers Win Stock Ruling	In a decision that could have wide ramifications for employment practices, a Federal appeals court has ruled that about 10,000 of Microsoft's current and former temporary workers are entitled to take part in the company's discounted stock-purchase plan. The decision on Wednesday, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, determined that a worker hired through a temporary agency could qualify as a Microsoft employee, depending on which company controlled that person's work.
5/13/1999	A Contest Is On in Britain To Revolutionize Cable TV	Something is stirring behind Britain's television screens and its name is Microsoft. Just as this country's networks prepare for a satellite-versus-cable battle over the spoils of high-technology digital television, the American software giant is positioning itself as a dominant player in a contest that will revolutionize Britain's cable industry and shape the oft-foretold era when the cable in the living room delivers not just soaps but high-speed Internet access, interactive shopping, telephony and E-mail.
5/12/1999	Sony Plans To Distribute Music on Line This Summer	Sony Music Entertainment says it will begin selling songs on line in digital form using Microsoft technology, accelerating the rush of record companies to the Internet even before the industry settles on a common standard. Sony's plan, being announced today, follows an announcement last week by the largest record company, Universal Music, a unit of the Seagram Company, that it would distribute music on line in digital form by the end of the year. The moves indicate the companies' eagerness to take advantage of the growing electronic commerce market.
5/12/1999	America Online Challenges Microsoft's WebTV	Only weeks after completing the purchase of the Netscape Communications Corporation -- the Microsoft Corporation's archrival in Web browsing software -- America Online Inc. announced yesterday that it would take on Microsoft in delivering the Internet over television sets. The new product, to be known as AOL TV, will compete directly with Microsoft's WebTV, which already has about 800,000 users.
5/11/1999	Microsoft Is Acquiring 4% Stake in Nextel	Demonstrating that its ambitions are not tethered to the wired world, the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $600 million in cash for about 4 percent of Nextel Communications Inc., a big national provider of wireless communications. Yesterday's deal appeared to be Microsoft's biggest move yet into the fast-growing wireless communications market. As part of the deal, Microsoft, the No. 1 personal computer software company, will help Nextel deliver data services, including electronic mail and date books to wireless phones.
5/11/1999	Candidates Falling Into the Open Arms Of High Technology	Vice President Al Gore makes a point in his Seattle visits of stopping at Internet companies like Amazon.com, the on-line commerce pioneer. Other Presidential hopefuls, including Senator John McCain, Representative John R. Kasich and former Senator Bill Bradley, have recently toured Microsoft's campus here. So far Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has not come near either Seattle or Silicon Valley in Northern California. But that did not stop a group of high-technology executives from taking out a newspaper advertisement in The San Jose Mercury News last month, calling Mr. Bush one of the ''visionary leaders who understand the New Economy'' and urging him to run for President.
5/10/1999	Microsoft Hunts Its Whale, the Digital Set-Top Box	Has William H. Gates become the Captain Ahab of the information age? Mr. Gates's white whale remains an elusive digital set-top cable box that his company, the Microsoft Corporation, is hoping will re-create the personal computer industry by blending the PC, the Internet and the television set into a leviathan living-room entertainment and information machine.
5/10/1999	Microsoft Agrees to Experiment With Nortel's Optical Network	The Microsoft Corporation, known as a company that runs on E-mail, may be right when it says that it demands more from its internal data network than perhaps any other company in the nation. To expand the capacity of that network, Microsoft has turned, at least tentatively, to the Nortel Networks Corporation. Today, the two companies plan to announce that Microsoft has agreed to try a new Nortel optical networking technology -- one designed to expand the capacity of fiber optic networks by a factor as great as 32.
5/7/1999	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the lists of witnesses in the Microsoft antitrust trial referred incorrectly to comments by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson about the earlier testimony of a witness, Richard Schmalensee of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The judge questioned an apparent contradiction in Mr. Schmalensee's testimony; he did not question his overall credibility.
5/7/1999	In AT&T Deal, Microsoft Buys Itself a Stake In 'Post-PC' Era	With a $5 billion investment in the AT&T Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation yesterday secured an inside track in supplying software for the high-speed communications networks of the future. But it has by no means assured that it will be the dominant supplier, as it is today in the personal computer industry. In addition to a small stake in the AT&T Corporation, Microsoft's investment bought it a pledge that a version of its Windows operating system will power as many as 10 million next-generation set-top boxes in AT&T's growing network of television cable systems. That would be twice as many boxes as were originally supposed to run Windows.
5/6/1999	CONCERNS RAISED AS AT&T PURSUES A NEW FOOTHOLD	A whirlwind of deals surrounding the AT&T Corporation's cable television ambitions raised concerns in Washington and in many high-technology quarters yesterday about the prospects for competition in the fast-growing communications industry. Having cleared the way to become the nation's biggest cable television company by acquiring Mediaone Group Inc., AT&T yesterday also moved to the brink of a partnership with the Microsoft Corporation, the software giant, to increase Microsoft's role as a supplier to AT&T's cable systems.
5/6/1999	Microsoft Presses Rival on Details of a Deal	A lawyer for Microsoft tried to make the case today that America Online planned to use ''all of its marketing muscle'' to promote its newly acquired product, the Netscape Navigator Web browser. But an America Online executive disputed that, saying the company thought ''the browser business is dead.'' The back and forth came this morning as Microsoft took the deposition of Barry Schuler, the president for interactive services at America Online, in preparation for the resumption of the antitrust trial late this month.
5/5/1999	AT&T Is Seen Forging Link To Microsoft	The AT&T Corporation is close to forming a wide-ranging partnership with the Microsoft Corporation as part of an intricate web of deals that also would make AT&T the winner in the battle against the Comcast Corporation for Mediaone Group Inc., the big cable television company, executives close to the negotiations said last night. Comcast bowed out of a potential bidding war for Mediaone last night by reaching an agreement with AT&T to exchange certain cable systems. The deal would give Comcast an additional two million subscribers and AT&T up to $9.2 billion.
5/5/1999	Microsoft To Upgrade Windows 98	The Microsoft Corporation plans to announce Windows 98 Second Edition today, an upgrade to the company's desktop operating system for consumers. The company said it planned to begin manufacturing the upgrade this week, and that it would be available from computer hardware makers and retail stores sometime in June. It will be sold through retail distributors for a street price of about $89.95, the company said.
5/4/1999	List of Final Witnesses Released in Microsoft Trial	The Microsoft Corporation and the Government both released the names today of the final witnesses each intends to call when the antitrust trial resumes later this month. The list indicates that the Government hopes to shore up its case, while Microsoft's goal, at least in part, is to change the subject of discussion to one that might make the Government's case seem irrelevant. The most surprising announcement came from Microsoft. The company is summoning David Colburn -- a senior executive for America Online and an important Government witness earlier in the trial -- to testify as a hostile witness in the final, rebuttal stage of testimony.
5/4/1999	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Pushing the Envelope at Sony; A Japanese Corporate Rebel With a Playstation Cause	It all started with a broken contract. In the early 1990's, Nintendo backed out of an agreement to include Sony CD-ROM technology in the next generation of its video game machines.
5/1/1999	I.B.M. May Testify for U.S. Against Microsoft in Trial	In its antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation, the Government has portrayed personal computer makers as little more than indentured servants of the software powerhouse. Again and again, Government lawyers asserted, Microsoft used the monopoly power of its Windows operating system to bend PC companies to its will, reducing competition and consumer choice. But a weak point in the Government's case has been that none of the PC companies it portrays as victims have taken the stand to support the Justice Department's charges. For the rebuttal phase of the trial, however, a manager of the International Business Machines Corporation's PC division has agreed to testify, according to people close to the case.
5/1/1999	Two May Aid Comcast Bid For Mediaone	Disturbed by the AT&T Corporation's cable television ambitions, America Online Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation may back the Comcast Corporation in its fight against AT&T to acquire Mediaone Group Inc., the big cable television carrier. Mediaone said yesterday that America Online, the No. 1 Internet service provider, and Microsoft, the No. 1 maker of personal computer software, had entered into confidentiality agreements with it. That would give the two titans of cyberspace access to Mediaone's secret internal financial information as part of due diligence in deciding whether to assist Comcast.
4/30/1999	Almost a Microsoft Witness, But Definitely a Hot Potato	He was personally asked to be a witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial by the software giant's chairman, William H. Gates, but he was quickly dropped from the company's witness list after he was questioned by a Government lawyer last fall. Yet judging from his deposition testimony released this week, Michael L. Dertouzos had a lot to say -- and he would have been a most unusual witness, blunt and direct, with views not tailored to either side.
4/29/1999	Microsoft Questions Delay in Announcement of a Merger Last Year	A lawyer for the Microsoft Corporation tried today to show that the Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online delayed the announcement of their merger for several weeks last fall, apparently because they feared that earlier disclosure of it might hurt the Government's antitrust case against Microsoft. In an attempt to suggest a plot between the two companies and the Government to keep their intentions from Microsoft's legal team, the lawyer, Michael Lacovara, questioned Peter Currie, a senior vice president for Netscape, for more than two hours. The deposition was the first of several that will be taken to prepare rebuttal arguments for the trial, which is in recess.
4/29/1999	Court Papers Show Open Style Of Many Microsoft Executives	In April 1995, long before the browser wars erupted, the Microsoft Corporation had recognized the challenge posed by the Internet. Its strategic response, its top technology executive urged, should be clear-cut: control as much of the crucial technology as possible, just as it does in the personal computer market with its industry-standard Windows operating system. ''The big issue to be concerned about is the same issue we've faced in the past -- proprietary standards coming from competing software companies,'' wrote Nathan P. Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer.
4/29/1999	Documents Say Microsoft Considered a Blow to Novell	Bent on breaking the spirit of the Novell Corporation, its Utah-based archrival in the network software market, the Microsoft Corporation in 1994 considered a recommendation that it lock up sales accounts at both the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Brigham Young University, documents filed yesterday in Federal court contend. In an E-mail message to Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, Mike Murray, a high-ranking Microsoft executive, wrote that at a retreat for company executives he had proposed that while the accounts were not Novell's largest, they were important psychologically and emotionally. ''The influence of the L.D.S. church in the Utah economy and culture is difficult to appreciate from a distance,'' Mr. Murray wrote. ''I recommend we throw some significant weight at this account.''
4/28/1999	Microsoft to Join Research on the Next Internet	The Microsoft Corporation, which was forced to scramble to catch up after a sluggish start on the Internet a few years ago, is moving to insure that it is at the forefront of Internet research. Microsoft will announce today that it is joining the research coalition that is leading the development of the next-generation Internet -- a highly reliable network that can move data at speeds 1,000 times faster than the fastest communications lines used by corporations and universities today.
4/22/1999	Mouse With a Camera Sees Rather Than Feels	With its sleek silver back and glowing red underbelly and taillight, the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer, which will become available in September, is the most visually striking computer mouse yet. But the most impressive feature about the mouse, which is expected to cost $74.95, is that Microsoft removed almost all the interior moving parts, including the mouse ball. Instead, the new mouse, which is about the same size as other such devices, uses an optical sensor and a digital signal processing (D.S.P.) chip to track minute movements over virtually any surface except glass. The camera snaps some 1,500 tiny images each second; the chip, using a process called image correlation processing, compares images to see what has changed, then translates the changes into coordinates that show how the mouse has moved.
4/21/1999	Browser Foes Drop Enmity to Run Start-Up Together	For the last few years, Hadi Partovi has been a front-line warrior in the ''browser war'' -- the blood feud between Microsoft and Netscape in the market for Internet browsing software, the focus of the Government's sweeping antitrust case against Microsoft. As the lead product manager for the Microsoft Corporation's Internet Explorer, Mr. Partovi, in a flourish of competitive zeal, once led a group that loaded a giant script ''E'' -- for Explorer -- on a truck and drove to Mountain View, Calif., where they plopped it on the front lawn of the Netscape Communications Corporation's campus. When a videotape demonstration that Microsoft presented two months ago at its antitrust trial proved embarrassing, he was summoned overnight to set things right. Mr. Partovi, a 26-year-old Harvard graduate, speaks movingly of his emotional bond to Microsoft and its people.
4/21/1999	Microsoft Says Earnings Outdo Expectations	Sailing above the price wars that have battered personal computer makers, the Microsoft Corporation reported third-quarter earnings yesterday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Microsoft reiterated warnings that growth could slow in coming quarters if companies defer technology purchases because of the Year 2000 problem. But company officials said sales to Asian markets had recovered, partly because of increased spending by the Japanese Government. Sales in Latin America, particularly Mexico and Brazil, remain depressed, they said.
4/20/1999	Apple Media Software Challenges 2 Rivals	In a direct challenge to both the Microsoft Corporation and Real Networks Inc., Apple Computer today introduced a new version of its Quicktime multimedia software designed to permit computer users to receive video and audio programming over the Internet. The distribution of multimedia material is emerging as one of the hottest businesses on the Internet. Last week in Hollywood, Microsoft announced its own technology in the field, known as MS Audio 4.0, and the International Business Machines Corporation and Sony Inc. announced an agreement to make their competing systems compatible with each other.
4/18/1999	Warding Off the Buying Hordes	Few mutual funds have benefited as much from the stock market's recent rally as Janus 20, the $26 billion fund whose strategy of holding 20 to 30 mostly large-capitalization growth stocks has more than doubled its investors' money since the beginning of 1998. In becoming essentially a proxy for the handful of stocks like America Online, Dell Computer and Microsoft that have fueled much of the market's rise, Janus 20 has also been one of the few large funds to significantly outpace the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index lately, attracting billions of dollars of money from new investors along the way.
4/18/1999	Is Mr. Gates Pouring Fuel On His Rivals' Fire?	THE worthies of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had just finished thanking William H. Gates profusely for paying for a planned new computer science building with a handwritten personal check for $20 million. No sooner had Mr. Gates walked out the door last week than a procession of leading researchers at the university's renowned Laboratory for Computer Science sketched out projects and visions of the technological future that all headed in one direction: away from the personal computer. In a talk called ''The Post PC Internet,'' David Clark, an M.I.T. computer scientist, described a world in which the personal computer is less important because everything -- TV, wristwatch, eyeglasses, toaster -- has a computer-on-a-chip and ''everything is going to be connected to the Internet.'' For example, a watch face might temporarily become a tiny screen displaying your appointments for the day, information sent wirelessly to the watch from its storage folder on the Internet.
4/15/1999	A Closed Review At Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash., is undertaking a closed review for the part of its account that advertises the Windows operating system in the United States, after withdrawing that assignment from Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. Spending has not been determined pending the formulation of plans to introduce Windows 2000; spending for previous versions ranged from $10 million to $100 million. Nicole Miller, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, confirmed reports of the decision in Adweek and the Advertising Age Daily Fax, attributing it to a shift in focus to concentrate on information technology and business computer customers. The change is part of a reorganization of Microsoft's product groups by customer segments. Wieden & Kennedy, which joined the Microsoft agency roster in 1994, retains the large assignment of creating corporate campaigns to promote the Microsoft brand.
4/15/1999	Technology You Can Dance To	At the House of Blues here on Tuesday night, there were all the makings of a good rock concert: excitement, fear, confusion, seduction, revolutionary fervor, cynicism. These emotions were inspired not by music, however, but by music-related technology. The occasion was a high-profile announcement by Microsoft of its entry into the businesses of downloading and streaming -- or listening in real time -- music from the Internet with its Windows Media Technologies 4.0. The excitement wasn't so much over Microsoft's announcement, though it is news that such a major corporation is making digital download software available before the major record labels have even completed their plans for getting into the business. The buzz was over the atmosphere surrounding the conference. Technology has been charging forward like a bull in a record shop, tearing apart the old music business model where the customer buys a CD at a store. It has created the potential for several new ones models to be built in its place, or at least as an alternative. All the new models involve using the computer as surrogate record store and stereo, with fans grabbing songs off the Internet and storing, arranging and listening to them on a media player in their computer.
4/13/1999	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about Microsoft's plan to deliver music files over the Internet misstated the amount the company invested recently in Reciprocal Inc., a maker of technology to protect digital copyrights. It was $15 million, not $1.5 million.
4/12/1999	Record Companies Are Wary Of New Microsoft Technology	The Microsoft Corporation is expected on Tuesday to enter the battle to deliver music to consumers who download the files through the Internet, according to people close to the company. At the House of Blues here, Microsoft is expected to introduce a technology called MS Audio 4.0, the latest contender trying to replace the MP3 file format, the system of digital compression that lets music fans convert songs and other audio into computer files quickly and without restrictions. The Microsoft product is faster and more powerful than MP3 and has built-in safeguards to deter unauthorized copying.
4/10/1999	Corrections	A report in the News Watch column of Circuits on Thursday about an on-line tutorial for Microsoft's Back Office Server 4.0 gave a date incorrectly in paraphrasing a comment from Kevin Breunig, group product manager for the program. He said the tutorial was written in 1997, not 1987.
4/9/1999	Read All About It: Testimony Omitted From Microsoft Trial	The judge trying the antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation is likely to find himself in the unusual position later this month of reading articles about testimony in the trial that has not yet been heard in court. That is one result of two orders Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court issued over the last week to comply with a 1913 law giving the public access to depositions taken in antitrust cases.
4/9/1999	Behind the Big Shift on Windows	Microsoft's decision not to blend its consumer and business Windows operating systems into a single product reflects profound changes in the consumer personal computer marketplace that have surprised both the software giant and its partner, Intel. Almost overnight the PC market has moved from a business defined by office products to one that is increasingly delineated by both consumer prices and features.
4/8/1999	Microsoft Plans An Upgrade Of Windows 98	Microsoft will ship an upgraded version of Windows 98 next year because of delays in developing a consumer version of its Windows 2000 system, the company said today. Microsoft's president, Steven Ballmer, told the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in Los Angeles that the upgrade would be called Consumer Windows for 2000 and would be aimed at the home-networking market, helping users link personal computers, printers, digital cameras and other devices.
4/8/1999	What's Funny at Microsoft? Blocking Netscape's Web Site	Microsoft has the reputation of being a ruthless, cutthroat competitor but, hey, that doesn't mean the company doesn't know how to have fun. In an on-line tutorial for Microsoft's Back Office Server 4.0 (www.microsoft.com/backofficeserver/guide/accessfund.asp?A=2), there is a section called Exercise 2: Control User Access to Internet Sites that teaches customers how to block certain Web sites. The example site used by Microsoft: www.netscape.com. The reference to blocking Netscape was first reported in an on-line mailing list distributed by James Love, the director of the public interest group Consumer Project on Technology. ''It surprised me,'' Mr. Love said. ''I mean, they're being accused of crushing Netscape. Maybe it was somebody's idea of a joke.''
4/7/1999	Dell Expands Venture With Linux Vendor	The Dell Computer Corporation said today that it would install Red Hat Software Inc.'s version of the Linux operating system on some of its computers and take a minority stake in the closely held Red Hat. The actions are a show of support for Linux, an alternative to the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system. Red Hat sells software and services related to Linux, a free computer operating system available on the Internet. Terms of Dell's stake in the company, which follows investments from the Intel Corporation, the International Business Machines Corporation, the Oracle Corporation and the Compaq Computer Corporation, were not disclosed.
4/5/1999	A Computer Virus Worse Than Melissa	To the Editor: The Melissa computer virus (news article, March 29) showed how viruses spread rapidly through homogeneous populations. It was a matter of time before a virulent parasite raced through the Internet's huge population of Microsoft-based hosts. In biology, lack of genetic diversity leads to extinction.
4/4/1999	Settling the Microsoft Case	After a decidedly uneven presentation of its case in court, Microsoft has come forward with a proposal to settle the antitrust suit it has been challenging since last year. The word from the Justice Department and some of the 19 state attorneys general prosecuting the case is that Microsoft's initial offer does not address their concerns about what they regard as anticompetitive conduct by the company. But the department and the attorneys general are right to pursue a possible settlement with Microsoft. A negotiated agreement, if done right, would be preferable to years of litigation, appeals and uncertainty for businesses and consumers in the fast-changing computer and software industry. Any resolution of the antitrust suit, whether negotiated or ordered by the courts, would have to remedy the problems defined cogently by the Justice Department. Microsoft has been clearly shown to exercise monopoly power in operating-systems software for personal computers in ways that coerce competitors and clients, depriving consumers of choices. The initial focus of the suit was the contention that Microsoft, by tying its operating system to its Internet Explorer browser, was muscling aside the rival browser made by Netscape. During the trial, the prosecution expanded its attack to include charges of strong-arm tactics against computer makers, software rivals and others.
4/2/1999	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday about a personal computer being offered by the Microworkz Corporation for $299 misstated one of the details of the offer. It does indeed include Microsoft Windows 98 software.
4/1/1999	Microsoft Judge Sets Date In May for Trial to Resume	The presiding judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial today tentatively set May 10 as the date for the trial to resume and laid out a longer timetable for additional testimony, oral arguments and written submissions, virtually insuring that the trial will not end much before 2000. That is a far cry from the fast-track trial originally anticipated. When the Justice Department filed the landmark antitrust suit last May, Government lawyers and the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court, said that because the issues were urgent, the trial would proceed quickly.
4/1/1999	Melissa And Her Cousins	MELISSA is a new and spectacularly promiscuous computer virus, one that has infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide since its discovery less than a week ago. It has already cost millions of dollars in lost productivity, experts estimate. And what a bargain it has been, because Melissa is relatively mild, as viruses go. The next time around -- and there will be a next time -- a Melissa-type virus could be much more damaging.
3/31/1999	Microsoft Settlement Talks Start Amid Secrecy	Settlement talks began this afternoon between the Microsoft Corporation and the Federal and state authorities who filed antitrust charges against the company almost a year ago. Both sides emphasized before the discussions started that they would talk in complete secrecy, and they stuck with that vow today. But it was clear from the opening positions of both parties that a vast gulf divides them, making a settlement difficult at best. The case has been in trial since October but is now in recess until the middle of April.
3/30/1999	Microsoft Will Reorganize Into 5 Units	Heralding an era he referred to as the ''vision version 2.0,'' the Microsoft Corporation's president, Steven Ballmer, announced the reorganization of the company yesterday into five divisions that he suggested would act with some independence. In a morning teleconference held with his friend, William H. Gates, who co-founded the company, Mr. Ballmer, who became president of Microsoft eight months ago, said that he was beginning to reinvent the company, the world's largest independent software maker, focusing it on initiatives that he said were largely ''customer driven.''
3/29/1999	Microsoft's Settlement Talks Hinge On PC Makers	They will not be at the table on Tuesday when the Justice Department and state attorneys general are scheduled to meet with Microsoft in Washington for settlement talks. But the nation's personal computer makers -- and the Microsoft Corporation's relationship with them -- will be the main topic of discussion as the two sides warily approach each other to see if there is some way to settle the antitrust suit against Microsoft, according to lawyers close to the case. To try to get settlement talks started, Microsoft sent the Government a framework document of less than four full pages last week. But if the negotiations are to move ahead, the lawyers said, Microsoft is going to have to go far beyond that initial step.
3/26/1999	Reaction to Offer From Microsoft Is Cool	State and Federal officials were dismissive today of Microsoft's proposal to settle its antitrust suit, but they added that the two sides would meet for settlement talks, probably beginning on Tuesday. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court asked both sides to try to settle the case during the trial recess that began on Feb. 26. As a result, officials said, even though the Justice Department and the state Attorneys General who filed the suit question whether the settlement proposal they received on Wednesday is serious, they feel compelled to show a good-faith effort.
3/25/1999	Microsoft Offers Settlement Script, in Rough Draft	The Microsoft Corporation made an opening step toward trying to settle its antitrust battle with the Government in a four-page proposal sent to the Justice Department on Monday, lawyers close to the case said yesterday. The proposal, described as a ''framework'' by one person close to the case, suggests easing Microsoft contract restrictions on personal computer makers, Internet service providers and others in the computer industry. These restrictions -- some of which Microsoft has already loosened under pressure from the industry and the Government -- limit manufacturers somewhat in what appears on the first desktop screen when users turn on their machines and restrict Internet service providers in the distribution of competing browser software.
3/25/1999	British Bookseller Plans Internet Service	W. H. Smith Group P.L.C., Britain's largest book retailer, said yesterday that it would set up a free Internet access service through a venture with the Microsoft Corporation and British Telecommunications P.L.C. Users will be able to buy books, music and videos. The move counters a free service begun by Dixons Group P.L.C. last September.
3/23/1999	On-Line Privacy Group Decides Not to Pursue Microsoft Case	A nonprofit watchdog group founded to monitor on-line privacy policies scolded but declined to pursue an audit yesterday of one of its biggest donors, the Microsoft Corporation. It was an awkward decision both because of Microsoft's contributions to the group, Truste, and because it comes at a crucial point in negotiations between the United States and the European Union over whether companies can effectively police themselves in cyberspace.
3/23/1999	Is Microsoft Moving to Settle? U.S. Says No	The way the Justice Department sees it, if the Microsoft Corporation and the Government are to begin talks to settle the antitrust suit now at issue in Federal court here, Microsoft will have to make the first move. So far, that has not happened. ''We have not received any settlement proposal from Microsoft,'' Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said today in response to a report in The Wall Street Journal that Microsoft had indicated an interest in a settlement.
3/21/1999	The Way We Live Now: 3-21-99 -- Product; Broken Windows Theory	Forget about Y2K. This is serious. Microsoft now acknowledges the existence of a bug in tens of millions of copies of Windows 95 and Windows 98 that will cause your computer to ''stop responding (hang)'' -- you know, what you call crash -- after exactly 49 days, 17 hours, 2 minutes and 47.296 seconds of continuous operation. All right, it's not really serious. At least there's no need to stockpile groceries and bottled water. It's just an unusually poignant reminder of how unreliable computer software remains, compared with the average household appliance. It's also a great excuse to hang out on the phone with a support engineer.
3/19/1999	Slimmer Version of Browser Is Rolled Out by Microsoft	The pitch was given on a stage designed to resemble a homey living room, but when Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, introduced a new version of his company's Web browser today, the most surprising new feature was all business. While much of the redesign was about trimming fat to produce a leaner program, the new browser, Internet Explorer 5.0, includes a feature that enables Internet sites to distribute their own versions of the program, customized with, for example, basic search or multimedia features or their own logos.
3/18/1999	Listen To This Browser	Pop quiz for the generation that has grown up with the Internet: Name the information appliance that used to be the focal point for family entertainment before the personal computer, and even before television. (Yes, there was life before television.)
3/16/1999	If Microsoft Loses Suit, 19 States Plan to Seek a Radical Overhaul	Flush with optimism about the way their case is progressing, the 19 state attorneys general who joined the Federal Government in the landmark antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation say they will not be satisfied, should they win the case, with any remedy that does not revamp the company. No specifics have been decided about how that should be done -- and probably none will be until the judge issues his ruling this summer. But as equal partners in the lawsuit, the states hold something of a veto power over the kinds of remedies the Federal Government can recommend, and the offices of the attorneys general are alive with discussion of the various options.
3/15/1999	Microsoft's Counterattack To Focus on Rivals' Linkup	The Microsoft Corporation, portrayed by the Government as an entrenched monopolist, will counterattack when its antitrust trial resumes next month by presenting evidence that suggests America Online Inc. plans to become a head-on challenger, according to people close to the software company. The Microsoft legal tactic focuses on the three-way deal announced in November, when America Online agreed to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation and made a side agreement to buy and jointly develop technology with Sun Microsystems Inc.
3/13/1999	Microsoft to Reorganize Into 4 New Groups	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it would soon announce a reorganization, creating four groups based on customer service instead of the current three based on technology. Robert J. Herbold, the chief operating officer of Microsoft, said at a special meeting of shareholders that an announcement ''will be coming in the near future.'' He was responding to a question about whether the company planned to reorganize.
3/12/1999	Microsoft to Defer $400 Million In Revenue to Its Fourth Quarter	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it expected to shift $400 million in revenue from its third quarter to its fourth quarter because of a delay in the introduction of Office 2000, the next generation of the popular group of word-processing and spreadsheet software. The chief financial officer of Microsoft, Greg Maffei, said the company would defer $400 million in revenue in the fiscal third quarter ending March 31. He projected $4.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, well below analysts' estimates of up to $4.9 billion.
3/11/1999	3Com-Microsoft Venture to Develop PC Products	The Microsoft Corporation and the 3Com Corporation today intend to announce an alliance to jointly develop products to connect personal computers and computer peripherals within homes, executives from the two companies said yesterday. One of the concepts behind the venture is that consumers could save money by sharing modems, printers, scanners and removable storage devices like zip disks by linking PC's into in-home networks rather than buy multiple peripherals to cover each computer in a home. The technology would also ease the playing of head-to-head computer games.
3/11/1999	Microsoft Lawyer's Assessment of Trial: Not to Worry	Outsiders may think that the Microsoft Corporation is faring badly in its antitrust trial. But the case is actually going Microsoft's way, according to an internal assessment sent to the company's senior executives last week. In a long status report, David Heiner, a senior Microsoft lawyer, said that the Government had proved nothing, that the news coverage was a slipshod distortion and that ''Microsoft will prevail.''
3/10/1999	Business Travel; Microsoft wants the U.S. to investigate possible antitrust violations by the nation's airlines.	Microsoft Corp is asking Justice Department to investigate possible antitrust violations by nation's airlines; company's MSN Expedia is among group of Web-based travel agencies that are furious over airlines' own aggressive on-line ticket sales and slim commissions they pay on-line agencies; group contends that airlines' practices are keeping most travel agents off the Web and making business untenable for those who do venture on line (M)
3/10/1999	Microsoft Appears Unlikely To Settle Its Antitrust Case	When the Microsoft antitrust trial broke for a six-week recess on Feb. 26, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had some parting words for both sides. He called the lawyers for the Government and the Microsoft Corporation into his chambers and told them to ''use this six weeks wisely,'' according to a person close to the case. It was a garden-variety judicial admonition, legal experts say, to urge the two sides to see if they could again try to settle their dispute. Judges, they say, typically prod litigants to reconsider the option of settlement at key stages in a case. In the Microsoft trial, the 12 witnesses for each side have concluded their testimony.
3/8/1999	Compressed Data; Pixel Aims to Exploit Fringes of the Desktop	In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corporation has repeatedly said that it has granted personal computer makers greater freedom to do as they please with the Windows desktop screen, which pops into view when a machine is turned on. One of Microsoft's old adversaries, Robert Steinberg, an intellectual property lawyer, has noticed the same thing -- and sees a business opportunity. ''There is some loosening up and, frankly,'' he said, ''that is one of the reasons I'm coming in.''
3/7/1999	Some Advice for Mr. Gates: Have Your Day in Court	Both sides in the Microsoft trial have retreated to their corners until mid-April, when the antitrust battle will resume in a Washington courtroom. Then, both the Government and Microsoft will have the opportunity to call a couple of rebuttal witnesses. The company has not ruled out the option of rolling out its ultimate weapon, William H. Gates. Here is an example of an E-mail one of his advisers might send, urging him to take the stand and suggesting what he might discuss. DEAR BILL:
3/7/1999	Fight of the (Next) Century; Converging Technologies Put Sony and Microsoft on a Collision Course	A BATTLE for control of the future of computing is looming between the personal computer industry and consumer electronics manufacturers. Its roots can be found in meetings like one held here in July 1995, shortly after Nobuyuki Idei became chief executive of the Sony Corporation. Briefing Mr. Idei on the importance of the Internet, Peter Sealey, a Sony consultant, noted that the year before, the dollar volume of PC sales had surpassed that of television sales in the United States for the first time.
3/7/1999	Microsoft Will Alter Its Software In Response to Privacy Concerns	The Microsoft Corporation moved to defuse a potentially explosive privacy issue today, saying it would modify a feature of its Windows 98 operating system that has been quietly used to create a vast data base of personal information about computer users. Microsoft in effect conceded that the feature, a unique identifying number used by Windows and other Microsoft products, had the potential to be more invasive than a traceable serial number in the Intel Corporation's new Pentium III computer chip that has privacy advocates up in arms. The difference is that the Windows number is tied to an individual's name, to identifying numbers on the hardware in his computer and even to documents that he creates.
3/6/1999	Hong Kong Phone Giant Seen in Microsoft Deal	Shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. staged their biggest rally in more than six months yesterday on anticipation that the company would team up with the Microsoft Corporation. Shares of Hong Kong's dominant phone company rose 9 percent, to $14 (Hong Kong), its biggest gain since Aug. 24.
3/5/1999	Microsoft to Sell Business Internet Software	Projecting a vision of a world in which most buying and selling takes place between machines, the Microsoft Corporation yesterday announced its electronic commerce strategy, a range of software products and services designed to automate business. Although Microsoft has generally been perceived to be trailing in Internet commerce systems, the company yesterday offered Biztalk, a new language, or a set of conventions, that it said would help draw together disparate business practices and electronic commerce technologies via the Internet.
3/5/1999	On Breaking Up Microsoft Into 'Baby Bills'	The nation's largest software-industry trade group has warned the Government not to impose sanctions on Microsoft that could ''fracture'' the role of the company's Windows operating system as an industry standard, if the Government wins its antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation. But the report by the Software and Information Industry Association, which was presented to the Justice Department two weeks ago, does recommend that the Government look seriously at breaking up Microsoft as a cure for what the report regards as the lack of competition in the software industry.
3/4/1999	New Program Is Introduced To Ease Use of Linux System	The free software movement today took its most significant step yet toward a direct confrontation with the Microsoft Corporation by introducing software that gives the powerful and free Linux operating system the ease-of-use found on Windows and Macintosh computers. The program, which is known as Gnome, for GNU Network Object Model Environment, was introduced here at the first Linux World computer exhibition. Its designers said that Gnome would make it possible for people who are not programmers or technicians to use Linux and the software that runs on it comfortably.
3/3/1999	MICROSOFT BUYS 5% STAKE IN DIALOGIC AND EXPANDS PACT	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would buy a 5 percent stake in the Dialogic Corporation for $24.2 million and enter a $20 million licensing and service pact with Dialogic to expand in telecommunications. Dialogic, which electronically links telephones and computers, will receive the $20 million over four years for product development, support and licensing of its products. The agreements expand the companies' previous joint development of standards for Internet voice transmission and could make it easier for software developers to write programs for voice transmissions over the Internet, voice recognition and call centers, analysts said. Shares of Dialogic rose $3.125, to $34, while Microsoft fell $3.1875, to $148.5625.
3/1/1999	Kazan's Oscar Award	To the Editor: Regarding Maureen Dowd's Feb. 24 column on the planned protests over the belated award given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to the director Elia Kazan, unless Mr. Kazan apologies and recants, two questions occur: If apologies are in order, shouldn't there be apologies from people who remained in the service of a dictator and mass murderer long after it was known that he was both? And would the arts community be so disturbed by Mr. Kazan's naming of names if the people whom Mr. Kazan identified were not Communists but unreconstructed Nazis? GEORGE MCKENNA New York, Feb. 24, 1999
3/1/1999	Compressed Data; Tiny Maker of Software Calls Big Microsoft's Bluff	Ah, the burden of proof. In January, the tiny software company Be Inc. briefly came into focus at the Microsoft antitrust trial, when a Microsoft executive asserted that Be could soon become a major competitor to his company. No matter that Microsoft controls some 90 percent of the personal computer operating system market and Be has virtually no market share.
3/1/1999	TECHNOLOGY: Market Place; Dragon Systems, a Former Little Guy, Gets Ready for Market	Dragon Systems, a developer of speech-recognition software in Newton, Mass., that is scheduled to sell shares to the public sometime in the next few weeks, is not your typical software debutante. Its two 50-something founders can remember when computers filled entire rooms, not just entire briefcases. It has no debt, and real revenue. It even has profit. And it has very impressive products.
3/1/1999	Editorial Observer; Does the Microsoft Trial Verdict Really Matter?	There have been at least a dozen trials of the century in the past 100 years, many of them soon forgotten. But the Microsoft trial now nearing an end deserves that label for the light it sheds on where the real power lies as the 20th century ends. Here is the world's most powerful government attacking the world's most valuable company. Yet there seems to be a consensus that the Government cannot win. Or, to be more precise, that it really cannot do anything to ultimately defeat Microsoft, whether or not it wins in court.
2/28/1999	For Microsoft, Humbled May Not Mean Defeated	For Microsoft's witnesses at its antitrust trial, the simple words of introduction have become deeply unnerving. ''My name is David Boies, and I represent the United States.'' It is no wonder the big software company's witnesses have come to fear facing Mr. Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, in the Government's sweeping antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation. Time after time, he has caught Microsoft witnesses off guard as the words from their mouths on the stand contradict the statements in internal Microsoft documents or in their own E-mail.
2/27/1999	Microsoft Rests Its Case, Ending On a Misstep	After more than five months of testimony, the Microsoft Corporation rested its case today in the Government's landmark antitrust suit, but not before the presiding judge had shouted angrily at the company's final witness and ordered him to stop talking. Today's incident was yet another blow in several months of missteps and embarrassments as Microsoft has tried to defend itself against Government charges that the company bullied the computer industry and used its monopoly in computer operating systems to the disadvantage of competitors.
2/26/1999	Microsoft Witness Peppered With Questions From Judge	A Government lawyer and Microsoft's next-to-last witness had been sparring for hours today when the presiding judge asked a few questions of his own that cut to the core of the company's defense. He spoke with a tone of skepticism that had several lawyers at Microsoft's table leaning forward tensely, mouths half open. The witness, Joachim Kempin, a Microsoft vice president, had been reciting the same argument each of the company's witnesses has offered over the last several months -- that the Microsoft Corporation had chosen to combine the company's Web browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system because the combination benefited consumers.
2/26/1999	Stop Criticizing Gates's Generosity	To the Editor: I was bemused when ''Gates's Library Gifts Arrive, but With Windows Attached'' (front page, Feb. 21) concluded with the question ''Can computers help bridge the nation's economic gaps?'' It seems there is concern that giving computers to libraries isn't enough because it won't conquer poverty.
2/25/1999	U.S. Lawyer Questions Message in Microsoft Videotape	A Government lawyer questioned another videotape demonstration at the Microsoft trial today, but this time the challenge dealt not with the reliability or honesty of Microsoft's tape but with its message. David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, has successfully attacked several videotape demonstrations Microsoft has played in court over the last few weeks, arguing that they were deceptively edited or did not show what the narrators' contended they did.
2/25/1999	Economic Scene; Antitrust case against Intel stresses customers, not rivals.	THERE is at least one way in which the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Intel, which goes to trial next month, is similar to the Justice Department's suit against Microsoft. Both cases focus on commonplace business practices that the Government says are O.K. when practiced by ordinary companies but not when practiced by monopolists. In Microsoft's case, the targeted practices are the ordinary stuff of antitrust suits -- tying the sale of two products together and entering exclusive contracts that cut off Microsoft's main rival, Netscape Communications, from customers. But the case against Intel is doubly peculiar. It focuses on Intel's alleged mistreatment of customers rather than of rivals. And the F.T.C. cites no actual harm to competition from Intel's behavior, no instance of impeding innovation or thwarting specific rivals. To win, some experts say, the commission will need to persuade the courts to set forth new principles of antitrust enforcement.
2/24/1999	Microsoft Official Concedes That He Erred in Testimony	The Government's lead lawyer accused a Microsoft executive of making up evidence at the antitrust trial today, and, after presenting the witness with his own E-mail contradicting his statements, forced him to correct his testimony. The courtroom incident focused on a matter of timing: when the executive, Daniel Rosen, had known that a software rival was making an Internet browser to run on the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system.
2/23/1999	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about an antitrust case against Intel misstated the actions of Microsoft in a case now being tried in Federal court. Although Microsoft succeeded in removing a judge in a previous antitrust case against it, as well as a special master in the current case, it has not sought the removal of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is now hearing the case.
2/23/1999	U.S. Attacks Microsoft Official on Netscape Meeting	The Microsoft executive responsible for dealing with the Netscape Communications Corporation testified today that he did not regard Netscape as a competitor in June 1995. But the Government presented E-mail written at the time in which the witness himself and other Microsoft executives portrayed Netscape as a potentially dangerous rival. The point is crucial because that meeting between Microsoft and Netscape is a key episode in the Government's antitrust case.
2/22/1999	COMPRESSED DATA; For the Big Corporation, 24-Hour Linux Support	Linuxcare Inc, small start-up, will offer large corporations around-the-clock support service for Linux, Unix-based computer operating system that is widely available free and rapidly gaining at least symbolic value as alternative to Microsoft's Windows and Windows NT programs (S)
2/22/1999	Antitrust Cases Illuminate Tangled Ties Atop the PC Industry; Microsoft and Compaq: Quarrelsome Partners Or Master and Servant?	The showdown in 1996 -- when Microsoft threatened to stop selling the Windows operating system to Compaq Computer unless Compaq also included the software maker's Internet browser -- is a central chapter in the Government's antitrust case against Microsoft. But a look beyond the court documents indicates that that was by no means the first time the software maker that dominates the industry and the largest producer of personal computers had clashed. A dispute between the two companies, over Compaq's plans to become a software player in its own right, was creating tensions as early as 1994.
2/22/1999	Patents; A growing fear that Internet patents threaten to undermine the very nature of the on-line world.	MANY Web site developers were angered earlier this month when they learned that the Microsoft Corporation had received a patent covering a fundamental technology adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium, a nonprofit group working to standardize the Web. Part of the furor arose because Microsoft, a member of the consortium, had not told members that it had applied for a patent covering aspects of a technology known as ''cascading style sheets.''
2/22/1999	Corrections	Because of a production error, the continuation of a front-page article yesterday on a philanthropic program by William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, that provides computers to libraries omitted a passage in some copies. The affected section should have read: ''The library program offers a glimpse into Mr. Gates's newly burgeoning philanthropy -- he and his wife also gave $2 billion last month to the William H. Gates Foundation, which focuses on world health and population issues, and followed that with another $1 billion earlier this month. It also casts new light on some old questions: Can computers help bridge the nation's economic gaps? And what is the role of the public library in the digital age?
2/22/1999	Antitrust Cases Illuminate Tangled Ties Atop the PC Industry; U.S. and Intel at Odds Over Issue That Raises Question of Law's Limit	The ''Wintel duopoly,'' as some have called the domination of the computer industry by Microsoft's software and Intel's hardware, is about to come under Government assault on a second front. With the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation wending its way to conclusion in a Federal court here, Federal Trade Commission lawyers are preparing for trial against the Intel Corporation in three weeks.
2/21/1999	The Rebel Code	One recent rainy afternoon at the home of Marcus Meissner in Erlangen, Germany, Meissner's computer froze. It was the sort of routine headache that most of us who rely on the alien machines endure on an almost daily basis. But Meissner, 25, didn't simpy reboot. Although by day a caretaker of elderly patients at a state-run nursing home, by night he is a foot soldier in the liberation army of Linux, an increasingly popular operating system that is available free on the Internet. Meissner is part of a global confederation of volunteers who are intent on ushering in a kind of parallel silicon universe in which computers don't crash, programmers readily share intellectual property and, incidentally, the Microsoft Corporation has no reason to exist, because Linux already belongs to everyone.
2/21/1999	Gates's Library Gifts Arrive, But With Windows Attached	Alabama was first. By early last year, nearly all of the state's public libraries had computers and Internet access. Then came Louisiana and Mississippi. Next up are Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia and New Mexico. ''We're literally going to march through the states,'' said Patty Stonesifer, president of the Gates Learning Foundation.
2/20/1999	Microsoft Seeks Some Salvage In Courtroom	Burned by a searing cross-examination of a senior Compaq Computer Corporation executive, the Microsoft Corporation and Compaq tried today to regain ground in Federal court, though they may have helped the Government as much as themselves. At the Microsoft trial on Thursday, David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, used documents from Compaq's files to portray Compaq, the world's largest maker of personal computers, as a fearful vassal of Microsoft.
2/19/1999	Tales of Fear And Loathing Of Microsoft	Using internal company documents and sworn depositions at the Microsoft trial today, a Government lawyer depicted the Compaq Computer Corporation, the world's largest manufacturer of personal computers, as so fearful of Microsoft that it repeatedly abandoned software products it preferred in favor of Microsoft's offerings and even passed on information about a competing operating system in violation of a nondisclosure agreement. ''In regard to browsers,'' one internal memo stated in May 1996, ''our goal is to feature the brand leader, Netscape.'' But in an E-mail written at almost the same time, a Compaq employee wrote, ''Microsoft is unhappy with the Netscape icon on the desktop and wants to get it off.'' He added, ''Microsoft's stance to date raises questions of improper use of their monopoly position.''
2/18/1999	Feeling Cyberwheels Rumble on the Track	THE big news in the auto industry is computers -- how many chips are on board in each new car and how software is improving car performance and revolutionizing car design. Meanwhile, companies like Microsoft and Electronic Arts are trying to build steering wheels and brake pedals into their video games. Now that computers are powerful enough to bring road rumble and potholes and centrifugal force to bear on the virtual driving experience, games enhanced with force feedback put you in the driver's seat, albeit in a hyperbolic automotive theme world where pebbles feel like giant boulders and idling engines buzz like chain saws. Of course, steering wheels and driving games are nothing new. Arguably, the first video-game steering wheel was the Atari 2600 paddle controller in 1978. Racing games for Atari and Colecovision didn't have much in the way of special effects. But they did create a competitive driving situation and, for a grade-school kid, that was enough. A decade later, Sony and Nintendo introduced controllers that vibrated, so if you crashed into a wall, you got buzzed. Around the same time, makers of personal computer peripherals began making bigger and more expensive versions of the same thing.
2/18/1999	Microsoft Trial Explores an Odd Alliance	A senior executive of the Microsoft Corporation reported in Federal court today that America Online had, at least for now, renewed its contract to equip its users with Microsoft's Internet browser -- even though it is buying Netscape Communications, Microsoft's main competitor in the browser field. The executive, Brad Chase, quickly added that he believed America Online would abandon Microsoft soon enough, dealing a serious blow to Microsoft's effort to make its browser, Internet Explorer, the industry standard.
2/18/1999	Microsoft Executive Denies Key Allegation in U.S. Case	A Microsoft Corporation executive yesterday denied a key allegation in the Government's antitrust case -- that the company had both threatened its main rival in the Internet software business and made it an illegal offer to divide the market. In his 90-page direct testimony, Daniel Rosen, a Microsoft general manager, called those portrayals of a June 1995 meeting between executives of Microsoft and the Netscape Communications Corporation as ''either fabrications or the products of a fundamental misunderstanding.''
2/18/1999	I.B.M. to Offer Linux With Netfinity Computers	In perhaps the most significant endorsement yet of the little operating system that could, the International Business Machines Corporation will announce today that beginning next month it will ship its Netfinity line of network server computers with the free operating system Linux pre-installed alongside Microsoft's Windows NT. Linux is a highly regarded flavor of Unix, a kind of operating system widely used in powerful business machines that serve as the hub of local computer networks and Web sites.
2/17/1999	A Government Attack on Multiple Fronts	At the Microsoft trial today, a Government attorney attacked the testimony of the company's senior marketing executive on multiple fronts, and at times the witness's explanations seemed to cause even the judge to question his credibility. During his two days on the witness stand, Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, tried to hammer home one central point: Microsoft's decision to bundle a Web browser with the Windows operating system was not anti-competitive because alternative browsers are easily available.
2/16/1999	Trial Will Show Microsoft's Benefits	To the Editor: In ''Microsoft's Miscues'' (editorial, Feb. 10) you malign the allegedly misleading videotape about Microsoft's browser, but this video was tangential to the legal conclusion the Justice Department continues to challenge: that the combination of a browser with Windows benefited users.
2/16/1999	Trial Will Show Microsoft's Benefits; Browser Evolution	To the Editor: The debate about Microsoft's integration of its browser and Windows (editorial, Feb. 10) does not take into account that operating systems have been evolving in this direction for some time. This is not the result of monopolistic or exclusionary objectives, but is driven by long-term trends in computer use.
2/16/1999	Calling In Experts to Fix Microsoft if It's Broken	For four months, in a Federal courtroom in Washington, the Government has relentlessly portrayed the Microsoft Corporation as a bullying monopolist. Now, as the antitrust trial enters the home stretch, the Government is moving beyond accusations to try to figure out how to curb the software giant without crippling it. The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft -- advised by a small group of economists, business school and law professors -- are scrambling to devise a set of remedial steps to recommend to the court if the Government wins the case.
2/16/1999	Protests Held Against Windows System	As mass movements go, Windows Refund Day might not have achieved the political profile of an antiwar protest or the popular support of, say, saving the whales. But for a demonstration over computer software, the turnout yesterday was not too shabby. More than 100 self-proclaimed computer geeks showed up at Microsoft Corporation sales offices in several cities to make a public display of rejecting the software maker's ubiquitous Windows operating system and of demanding their money back.
2/15/1999	Ticketmaster and Microsoft Settle Suit on Internet Linking	Ticketmaster, a unit of Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc., has settled its two-year-old lawsuit against Microsoft. Although the parties agreed not to disclose the terms of the settlement, executives said the agreement did resolve the suit's central issue -- whether Microsoft's Sidewalk on-line city guides could bypass many of Ticketmaster's advertising-laden Web pages and link Sidewalk users directly to the ticket-purchase portions of Ticketmaster's site.
2/15/1999	Slate Drops Its On-Line Subscription Fee	It was an important test of one facet of Internet commerce: Would readers pay an annual subscription rate of $19.95 for the privilege of reading a magazine on line? If the tale of Slate magazine, which is owned by Microsoft, is any indication, the answer is no. Ten months after deciding to charge readers $19.95 a year, the publisher of the on-line magazine announced in an E-mail notice to subscribers that, as of last Friday, it would now be available free on the World Wide Web.
2/15/1999	Footnotes In the U.S. V. Microsoft	The pawns in the Microsoft trial are the smaller companies whose business practices have been scrutinized and then thrown into the spotlight of courtroom debate to bolster the case of either Microsoft or the Justice Department. Companies used this way in the last couple of weeks have included Red Hat Software, Netcom, Caldera and Be Inc.
2/15/1999	Microsoft Denies That It Is Developing a Language Similar to Java	The Microsoft Corporation is playing down a report in today's PC Week, a trade magazine, that the company has been briefing software developers on a new programming language that would be similar to Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java software, but free of technological or licensing obligations to Sun. Sun recently won a court order blocking Microsoft from shipping products containing Microsoft's own version of Java, which Sun says was altered to work only with Microsoft Windows, thus thwarting the so-called cross-platform capability designed into the language. Cross platform means that a developer can write one version of a program in Java, which can then run on Windows, Macintosh, Unix and other software operating systems. Microsoft is appealing the ruling.
2/14/1999	The Three Microsofts	Robert Bork, once upon a time too conservative to get onto the Supreme Court, now has a modest proposal for helping the world cope with Microsoft: split the company into triplets -- three equal, cloned Microsofts. It's just an idea, he says. After all, the company hasn't even been found guilty. And it does sound scary: three new companies, each starting fresh with its own copy of the Windows source code, and each with its own copy of the gene for Determination to Vanquish All Competitors and Control the World. He's on to something. There would be complications, for sure. The three new Microsofts couldn't really be identical. For example, only one of them (call it ''Huey'') could have Bill Gates himself, the chief executive once famous for holding a tactical and strategic road map of the entire computer industry inside his head. Dewey and Louie would have to go scrounging for C.E.O.'s of their own.
2/11/1999	U.S. Hammers At Microsoft's Browser Deals	A senior Microsoft official acknowledged in Federal court today that the company's contracts had prohibited Internet service providers from offering its browser on the same Web page as its main competition because Microsoft executives ''thought we would lose in a side-by-side choice.'' The admission clearly pleased David Boies, the Government lawyer who elicited it from the witness, Cameron Myhrvold, a vice president in the Microsoft Corporation's Internet Customer Unit division -- so much so that Mr. Boies asked the same question four different ways and got the same answer each time.
2/11/1999	A Virtual Time Capsule Is Fired Into Cyberspace	Virtual reality claimed yet another vestige of the physical world last week at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Sloan School of Management there sealed and launched a time capsule, but the contents are all digital, the capsule merely virtual and its destination not deep space, but cyberspace. In the encrypted capsule, which is held on a server at M.I.T., are symbols of life and business on the Internet, including audio files of the impeachment proceedings, a sample of the Victoria's Secret Web site, Amazon.com pages and snippets of Dilbert and South Park cartoons.
2/9/1999	Revamping Said to Be Set At Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation is moving to reorganize itself into divisions focused on different customer groups rather than on products, analysts and people close to the company said yesterday. Such a change would be a big shift in orientation for a company that has long emphasized engineering over marketing. ''It clearly signals a refocusing on the customer rather than on the technology,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst at Giga Information Group.
2/9/1999	Microsoft Executive Ends The Day Mostly Unscathed	At the Microsoft trial today, the biggest news was what did not happen: For the first time since the company began presenting its defense against Federal antitrust charges last month, a major company witness did not leave the courtroom with his head on a platter. All through the Government's presentation of its case against the Microsoft Corporation last year, company executives counseled patience. When their time came, they promised, they would present a robust, effective defense.
2/8/1999	Microsoft Is Starting Web Site Aimed at Big Audience: Women	The Microsoft Corporation is set to introduce a Web site for women today, hoping to capture what many feel is the largest and fastest-growing market on the Internet. Called Women Central, the site will feature content from Women.com, the largest on-line publisher of women's material, as well as original material, including Microsoft's own Underwire on-line magazine. The company has signed the Unilever Corporation as the site's primary sponsor.
2/8/1999	Microsoft Trying to Rebuild Tarnished Case in Antitrust Trial	It was a fleeting, unguarded moment that eloquently captured one of the agendas at the Microsoft antitrust trial. Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had finished a two-week stint as leadoff witness for the Microsoft Corporation. Well after the trial session had ended for the day, Mr. Schmalensee walked out a side door of the courtroom, down an all-but-deserted hallway, flanked by two colleagues.
2/7/1999	From One Household, Two Microsoft Slayers	It would be hard to find a more computer-literate pair of lawyers than David and Mary Boies. Mr. Boies (pronounced boys) is the Justice Department's hired gun and lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft antitrust case who has spent the last two weeks gleefully torturing Microsoft executives on the witness stand. His wife, Mary, also a litigator, has taken up a second career in software. Frustrated with the resistance of her two sports-happy children to learning to type, she created educational typing programs that revolve around soccer and basketball. Her ''Slam Dunk Typing,'' distributed by the Learning Company, briefly became a top-10 seller last fall among home education programs. A new title, ''All Star Typing,'' is to be released next month. The Learning Company's Mavis Beacon series ''is the Microsoft of typing programs,'' Ms. Boies said, ''but we're taking the giant on.''
2/6/1999	Bill Gates And His Wife Give Away $3.3 Billion	William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, and his wife, Melinda, have given $3.3 billion to their two foundations, the president of one of the foundations said yesterday. The gifts bring the total assets of both foundations to nearly $5.5 billion, putting the William H. Gates Foundation in the top 10 foundations in the United States in assets, and the Gates Learning Foundation in the top 30, said Sara Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center, a nonprofit organization that tracks foundations.
2/5/1999	Microsoft Shows a New Tape, and Raises Some New Questions	Trying to stop the damage from a disastrous week in court, the Microsoft Corporation played a new videotaped demonstration at its antitrust trial today. The 70-minute video showed James E. Allchin, a senior company executive, performing live tests and then looking into the camera and saying that he had proved his point -- that a prototype Government program intended to separate Microsoft's Web browser from the Windows operating system had really done no such thing.
2/4/1999	Judge Questions Microsoft Videotape Evidence	The Federal judge hearing the Microsoft antitrust case openly questioned the reliability of video evidence the company had presented in court and called the situation ''very troubling.'' In a tense, packed courtroom, the Microsoft Corporation suffered its second embarrassing setback in two days, stumbling yesterday and staggering today. A few minutes after the judge's criticism, Microsoft tossed in a white towel for the day. A Microsoft lawyer asked to approach the bench, and the judge agreed to end proceedings for the day to let Microsoft regroup and try again Thursday.
2/3/1999	U.S. Attacks a Microsoft Videotape as Misleading	In one of the most sensational moments since the Microsoft antitrust trial began, the Government accused a senior Microsoft executive in Federal court today of offering a misleading videotape into evidence and using it to try to discredit an important Government witness. Initially, James Allchin, the Microsoft executive, was embarrassed and said that his staff had made an error.
2/2/1999	U.S. Pushes to Get a Microsoft Defense to Boomerang	The Microsoft Corporation set out in Federal court this morning to demonstrate that computer users gain numerous benefits from the company's decision to integrate a Web browser with the Windows operating system, but by this afternoon the demonstration appeared to have backfired. On cross-examination, James Allchin, a senior Microsoft executive, readily acknowledged that nearly all of the same benefits would be available to users who bought a version of Windows with no browser included -- and later installed Microsoft's browser separately.
2/1/1999	Media Talk; Column by Slate Writer Draws Fire	Scott Shuger spends the small hours each morning reading newspapers on line and writing a daily column for Microsoft's on- line magazine, Slate, critiquing newspapers across the country. The column, Today's Papers, appears unedited. Last week, Mr. Shuger was the target of some pretty fiery critiques himself.
2/1/1999	Microsoft Fate Hangs on Issue of Credibility	The legal standard of proof in the Microsoft antitrust case, as a civil action, is the court's judgment of which side is favored by a ''preponderance of the evidence.'' The mere phrasing suggests a carefully calibrated balancing -- 51 to 49 is all it takes to win. But since so much of the case revolves around what happened at private meetings between the Microsoft Corporation and other companies, the judicial balancing will lean heavily on a wholly subjective criterion: credibility.
1/31/1999	Making Money, Giving Money	Jeff Reifman thinks one reason Microsoft hired him when he was 20 was the ''Calvin and Hobbes'' cartoon on his resume. Eight years later, he's still operating in a humane, slightly offbeat way, splitting his time between the software giant, where he is a manager, and Giving.org, a nonprofit group he created to funnel profits back to the Seattle community. Its cornerstone is Habitat Espresso, a cafe that opened in the city in November 1997. Customers vote on which local charities will receive half the profits from the cafe; the other half goes to a fund to start other nonprofit businesses. In July, the group bought the Four Angels Cafe, another Seattle spot that now donates its profits, and in October it started Myfirstweb.com to offer affordable Internet services. Giving.org has contributed more than $40,000 to Seattle charities.
1/30/1999	Ruling Backs Release of Microsoft Trial Material	A Federal appeals court ruled yesterday that all the deposition transcripts and videotapes in the Microsoft antitrust trial must be made public. The material includes the entire 20 hours of taped deposition testimony of William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, as well as about 100 other depositions taken by the Government or the company.
1/29/1999	Microsoft Told to Turn Over A Key Internal Document	The Federal judge in the Microsoft antitrust case today ordered the company to turn over an internal document to the Justice Department that Government lawyers said could undermine one of the software giant's defenses. The Government lawyers said the document supported their contention that Microsoft's Internet browser could be identified as a distinct product from its Windows operating system. Microsoft officials have maintained that the browser and the operating system cannot be separated.
1/28/1999	MICROSOFT TO INVEST IN DUTCH CABLE-TELEVISION COMPANY	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would invest $300 million in United Pan-Europe Communications N.V., the largest Dutch cable-television company, to push high-speed Internet access in Europe. The investment will be made through U.P.C.'s initial public offering, where it will sell as much as $1.25 billion in shares, representing about a third of the company. Microsoft will get a 7 percent to 8 percent stake. U.P.C and Microsoft will also develop digital video and Internet-based telephone services in Europe.
1/28/1999	Microsoft Official Defends Company's Strategy at Trial	A senior executive of the Microsoft Corporation delivered a forceful defense of the company's actions in the Internet software market today, saying it had acted mainly in the pursuit of a ''Holy Grail of software development'' by making its products more powerful, easier to use and seamlessly integrated. The executive, James Allchin, the second company official to appear as a witness at the Microsoft antitrust trial, also argued that other software makers have done what the Government says is anticompetitive in Microsoft's case and presented a detailed history of his company's product plans for the Internet.
1/28/1999	A Giant's Generosity	To the Editor: Microsoft takes a lot of heat for being big, but customers and sometimes society may reap benefits from its size. One example is the company's no-doubt-money-losing decision to publish Encarta Africana. As noted in ''Planet Africa: Black History on Disk'' (Jan. 21), this ambitious project, originally a dream of W. E. B. Du Bois, was given the thumbs down by several publishers, including Encyclopedia Britannica and Random House. Thankfully, Microsoft's size allows it to practice such corporate philanthropy. All of us are richer for it. Sometimes size allows companies to do good without worrying about doing well. MARC BEAUCHAMP Falls Church Va., Jan. 24, 1999
1/27/1999	Compaq to Sell Small Stake In Alta Vista Search Site	The Compaq Computer Corporation said yesterday that it would sell a minority stake in its Alta Vista service to the public as part of an effort to build a leading player in advertising and shopping on the Internet. The announcement comes just days after extended negotiations between Compaq and Time Warner Inc. collapsed, according to executives familiar with the talks. Time Warner was going to exchange its extensive Internet operations, including sites linked to its magazines, CNN and Warner Brothers entertainment properties, in return for a big stake in Alta Vista, the people said. The talks ended, among other reasons, because Time Warner was not willing to cede Compaq any control over its news and entertainment content, the executives said.
1/27/1999	Microsoft Official Says Company Sought Cooperation	A senior executive of the Microsoft Corporation testified today that his company tried to convince its main rival in the Internet software market to become less of a head-on competitor. Paul Maritz, the highest-ranking executive appearing as a witness at the Microsoft antitrust trial, portrayed the discussions with the Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995 as mainly an effort to find ''common ground'' between the two companies.
1/26/1999	MICROSOFT INVESTS IN BRITISH CABLE OPERATOR	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it planned to invest $500 million in NTL Inc., a telecommunications company based in New York that is the No. 3 cable television operator in Britain. The investment will help Microsoft promote high-speed phone, video and Internet services in Britain and Ireland. Microsoft owns the MSN Network.
1/26/1999	At Microsoft Trial, Accounts Differ on Dealings With Apple	The Justice Department's lead lawyer in the Microsoft antitrust case clashed today with the company's highest-ranking witness as the Government charged that the software maker had used its market power as ''a club'' in its dealings with Apple Computer Inc., while the Microsoft executive countered that his company was responding to a threat of ''patent terrorism'' from Apple. The conflicting accounts of how Microsoft convinced Apple to make Microsoft's Internet software the preferred choice over that of its browser rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation, was the main focus of the Government's early cross-examination of Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, who took the stand this afternoon.
1/25/1999	Linux Users Planning to Take Demands Straight to Microsoft	Proponents of the Linux software operating system would rather not have Microsoft Windows on their personal computers -- and would most definitely rather not pay for Windows, which is standard issue on most PC's. Now with a militancy that seems to be part of the movement, a band of Linux users plans to demand its Windows money back. The users are hoping to use a loophole that they say they have found in the end user licensing agreement for Windows, which says, in effect: If you do not agree with the stated terms and conditions, do not use the software. Those who do not agree to the terms, the agreement states, should ''promptly contact manufacturer for instructions on return of the unused product(s) for a refund.''
1/25/1999	TECHNOLOGY: MAN IN THE NEWS -- Paul Maritz; Microsoft's Star Antitrust Witness	It is certain to be the hot seat. But Paul Maritz, who takes the witness stand this week as the highest-ranking Microsoft official scheduled to testify in the company's antitrust trial, is an executive known for a cool, sometimes prescient, analytic style. In 1988, for example, he was placed in charge of the Microsoft Corporation's prickly partnership with I.B.M. in developing a new personal computer operating system, OS/2.
1/24/1999	Trial's War of Economists Pits Student Against Teacher	FOR the last few weeks the Microsoft antitrust trial has heard warring economists provide sweeping overviews of each side's case. These two particular economists have a history. The Government's witness, Franklin M. Fisher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was the thesis adviser of the chief Microsoft economics witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, also of M.I.T. Perhaps that is why Mr. Schmalensee appears to take impish delight in poking fun at his mentor.
1/23/1999	Microsoft Executive's Testimony Attacks Accusers	The most senior executive of the Microsoft Corporation to testify at its antitrust trial delivered an unflinching defense of the company's practices yesterday and an attack on the testimony of industry executives who appeared as Government witnesses. In 160 pages of written testimony, Paul Maritz, a group vice president at Microsoft, described the software industry as one of fierce competition and relentless change, creating wealth and benefiting consumers. And he warned of the danger of Government meddling.
1/22/1999	Microsoft and the Question of Monopoly	The judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial asked the company's expert witness on economics a series of skeptical questions today, suggesting that the Microsoft Corporation may have a difficult time with one of its defenses -- that it does not have a monopoly in the market for personal computer operating systems. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted when a Microsoft lawyer was questioning Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist and dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, about the price Microsoft charges for its industry-standard Windows operating system. Mr. Schmalensee was explaining his view that the modest price Microsoft charges for Windows, typically less than 5 percent of the cost of a personal computer, indicated a company concerned about current and potential competition instead of the predatory monopolist the Government has tried to paint for the court.
1/21/1999	U.S. Presents Documents in Case Against Microsoft	The Government presented documents and E-mail in the Microsoft trial today as evidence for its allegation that the big software maker had imposed contract restrictions on personal computer makers to thwart competition. The contracts imposed strict limits on Windows' opening ''desktop,'' the screen that computer users see when they turn on their computers. These limits clearly upset some manufacturers who wanted to use the desktop to display their own brands or to feature factory-installed software -- often made by Microsoft's competitors.
1/21/1999	Planet Africa: Black History on Disk; Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Microsoft Produce A Long-Awaited, Much-Debated Encyclopedia	IN 1995, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard professor and perhaps the most widely recognized African-American scholar today, cast himself in the role of fast-talking encyclopedia salesman. Dr. Gates, who had begun dreaming of creating a comprehensive encyclopedia of the black world two decades earlier, found himself in New York presenting his proposal to executives from the giant publishing company Random House. But before he could finish his pitch, the company's chief executive, Alberto Vitale, asked him if the encyclopedia could be done as a multimedia CD-ROM, rather than in the conventional print-only manner. ''Of course,'' was Dr. Gates's response. The only hitch: he had no idea what a CD-ROM was.
1/20/1999	Microsoft's Profit Up 75% In Quarter	Strong shipments of personal computers strengthened the second-quarter financial results of the Microsoft Corporation, which reported a 75 percent gain in earnings yesterday, far exceeding the most optimistic projections of Wall Street analysts. But officials at Microsoft, the world's leading maker of personal computer software, remained cautious in their outlook, citing concerns about the uncertainty of corporate spending on solutions to the Year 2000 computer clock problem as well as continued financial crises in many foreign markets.
1/20/1999	Browsers and Borders Are Argued at the Microsoft Trial	In the Microsoft antitrust trial, the Government spent most of today attacking the company's central defense -- that its Internet browsing software is a seamless feature of its Windows operating system and not a stand-alone product. The Government is trying to prove that the browser and operating system are two products, illegally bundled together mainly to stifle competition. But the Justice Department and 19 states suing the Microsoft Corporation face an uphill struggle to confirm that allegation. In a related case, a Federal appeals court ruled last June that Microsoft had virtually unlimited freedom to include anything it wanted in its products. The decision pointedly noted the ''undesirability of having courts oversee product design.''
1/18/1999	Just What Constitutes a Consumer Stranglehold?	The Microsoft trial is a high-stakes exercise in legal warfare and the witnesses are foot soldiers. On each side they are advocates, committed to winning and thoroughly coached. And no one expects that honesty will be presented in its undiluted form -- ''the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.'' Instead, the witnesses generally offer their facts and opinions selectively.
1/18/1999	Little-Known Project Developing Alternative Software to Windows	In painting the perils that could topple his mighty Microsoft empire, William H. Gates likes to invoke the theoretical young programmer toiling in obscurity somewhere, at work on the software project that could overtake the industry-dominating Windows software operating system. As effective a rhetorical device as Mr. Gates may find this when confronting antitrust enforcers, he may not have considered the possibility that the obscure toiler already exists in the person of a 28-year-old Swiss programmer, Alexandre Julliard. For the last four years Mr. Julliard has been coordinating a little-noticed international project that is intended to let PC users run their normally Windows-dependent programs on Linux -- a free operating system, whose devotees would very much like to overthrow Microsoft's hegemony.
1/15/1999	Microsoft Appeals Court Ruling on Java	The Microsoft Corporation appealed a court order requiring its software to pass Sun Microsystems Inc.'s compatibility tests for its Java computer language today, arguing that the dispute was about contracts, not copyrights. Microsoft said it had filed the appeal Wednesday with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, arguing that its Java licensing contract with Sun did not allow court injunctions to resolve disputes. The preliminary injunction requiring Microsoft to modify its software was issued by United States District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose, Calif., on Nov. 17.
1/15/1999	Microsoft Witness Attacked For Contradictory Opinions	A Justice Department lawyer produced several prominent academic papers today that he said showed that the Microsoft Corporation's first witness in its antitrust trial had written opinions contradicting views he has offered in expert testimony for the software giant. In a broad attack on the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, produced evidence that a survey cited by Mr. Schmalensee in his testimony actually appeared to be a publicity tool ginned up by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates.
1/14/1999	Dueling M.I.T. Economists Testify at Microsoft Trial	In the Microsoft trial today, a Justice Department lawyer opened cross-examination of the company's first witness by asking him to concede that Microsoft held a monopoly in personal-computer operating systems. But although the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had submitted 328 pages of written testimony addressing every aspect of the Government's antitrust case, he said he had never studied the market for personal-computer operating systems, because ''I didn't see any particular purpose in investigating that question.''
1/12/1999	Microsoft Puts Its First Witness On the Stand	The Microsoft Corporation began its defense in the Government's antitrust lawsuit today with an economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bearing a massive tome of written testimony with a simple message: Microsoft's business practices are good for consumers, and any Government meddling with the software industry would likely do more harm than good. The 328-page testimony by Richard L. Schmalensee of M.I.T. is a sweeping rebuttal to the Justice Department's two-and-a-half-month attempt to prove that Microsoft used its monopoly in personal computer operating system software to thwart competitive challenges posed by the rise of the Internet.
1/12/1999	A Microsoft Bug Could Make Some Early Birds an Hour Later	As if all the panic over the infamous Year 2000 computer glitch were not enough of a problem, experts now reveal that the omission of a single equal sign has created a time-related error in the Microsoft Corporation's Windows family of operating systems that will next appear on April 1, 2001. The timing, it turns out, has nothing to do with April Fools' jokes but rather with an error in calculating the beginning of daylight saving time. The bug causes Windows applications to behave as if it is one hour earlier than the correct time shown on the Windows clock. The problem will continue for one week, until April 8, 2001, when the applications will shift to daylight time and again be in sync with the operating system and the rest of the nation.
1/12/1999	Banyan Says Microsoft Is Buying Stake	Banyan Systems Inc., an Internet directory company, said today that the Microsoft Corporation would buy a 7.5 percent stake in the company for $10 million and work with Banyan to develop software programs. Banyan, which is based in Westboro, said Microsoft would provide the $10 million over three years for costs of training at least 500 employees and for purchase of 1.75 million stock warrants.
1/11/1999	Media Talk; Taking a Writer's Touch Inside Microsoft Word	James Fallows, the former editor of U.S. News and World Report and author of ''Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American Democracy,'' is well known as a critic of what journalists write. But he has also been an armchair critic of the computer software that they use to write with. Now Mr. Fallows, 49, who was replaced last June as editor of U.S. News, has an opportunity to influence the software. He joined the Microsoft Corporation last week as a member of the product development team for Word, the leading word-processing program.
1/11/1999	Market Place; Analysts find Silicon Graphics' new technology more compelling than its outlook for investors.	AFTER three years of declining fortunes, Silicon Graphics Inc. is placing a big bet today as it introduces a line of work stations built around Intel chips and Microsoft software. While analysts like the new machines, nearly all remain neutral on the shares of Silicon Graphics, saying that the company has yet to show that it can return to sustainable growth and profitability.
1/10/1999	Private Sector; This Is No Pie-in-the-Sky Concept	If he doesn't watch out, Bill Gates could get a second serving. All that Gerrit Zalm, the Dutch Finance Minister, could think to say after getting hit in the face with two custard pies on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on Monday was: ''This is incomprehensible.'' One of the two attackers, who were protesting the introduction of the euro, Europe's new currency, was grabbed by George Moller, the exchange's president.
1/8/1999	Prosecution Almost Rests in the Microsoft Trial	As the last Government witness nears the end of his testimony, it is increasingly clear that the Government's antitrust case against Microsoft is an indictment not only of the business practices of the world's dominant software maker but also of its corporate character. Witness after witness -- an executive roll-call of companies that drive today's economy, including Intel, I.B.M., Netscape Communications, America Online, Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer -- has portrayed the Microsoft Corporation as a bullying monopolist. The Justice Department charges that Microsoft is guilty of a litany of misconduct, including illegally using its market muscle to impose restrictive contracts, to engage in predatory pricing and to attempt to divide markets.
1/7/1999	Microsoft Presses Its View About Rivals' 3-Way Deal	In its antitrust trial today, the Microsoft Corporation made its most concerted effort yet to convince a Federal judge that the recently announced deal that brings together three of its rivals -- America Online Inc., the Netscape Communications Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc. -- seriously weakens the Government's case. In a three-way deal announced in late November, America Online agreed to buy Netscape for $4.2 billion and made a side agreement to buy and jointly develop technology with Sun. Last month, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the outcome of this nonjury trial, expressed the view that the deal ''might be a very significant change in the playing field as far as this industry is concerned.''
1/6/1999	Pricing at Issue As U.S. Finishes Microsoft Case	The Government called its last witness in the Microsoft trial today after presenting 110 pages of his written testimony that amount to a summation of -- and economic justification for -- the Justice Department's sweeping antitrust suit against the software giant. Much of the testimony by the witness, Franklin M. Fisher, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a detailed review of major allegations in the Government's case. But he also sought to advance the case and strengthen the argument for strong sanctions against Microsoft with his analysis of Microsoft's pricing tactics.
1/5/1999	Intuit's Chief Urges Division of Microsoft	A senior computer industry executive, testifying in Federal court today, urged the judge to divide or limit the Microsoft Corporation so that the company could not use its market-dominating Windows operating system to promote its other products. ''It seems to me reasonable for the court to make a distinction between operating systems and other applications,'' said William H. Harris, the chief executive of Intuit Inc., which makes Quicken, the market-leading personal finance software. ''To the extent that the operating system is an essential service,'' one that consumers have no choice but to use, ''such market power should not be used to leverage into other markets,'' he added.
1/4/1999	Microsoft Battles a Bevy of Foes	The Justice Department's antitrust suit against Microsoft began in November and continues into this year. The department and 20 states are contending that Microsoft used its monopoly position in operating-system software to stifle competition. William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and lawyers for the company have denied all of the claims. During the course of the trial, three of the software maker's competitors joined forces. In a complicated arrangement, America Online agreed to buy Netscape Communica-tions for $4.2 billion and also entered a marketing arrangement with Sun Microsystems. Microsoft quickly responded in court that the deal proved that competition was indeed thriving, thereby undermining the Government's case. The Government, however, disagreed.
1/3/1999	Business; Playing 'The Price Is Right' With Windows	IF the Microsoft Corporation is the predatory monopolist that the Government claims it is, why isn't the price of its monopoly product -- its industry-standard Windows operating system -- higher? That question is a central focus of a new study of Microsoft and the Government's antitrust suit against the company by Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Mr. Hall helped draw up the Justice Department's 1995 consent decree with Microsoft.
12/31/1998	Rival Warns That Microsoft Could Control Web Trade	The president of Intuit Inc. stated yesterday that the Microsoft Corporation could use its market power to gain control over ''major areas'' of Internet commerce and asked the courts to give Microsoft's rivals equal access to its Windows operating system and desktop screen. The 47-page written testimony of William Harris of Intuit, maker of Quicken personal finance software, brings two new issues into the Microsoft antitrust trial -- Microsoft's potential impact on the fast-growing field of Internet commerce and possible steps to curb Microsoft's power. Both issues have been much debated outside the courtroom.
12/31/1998	Of Mice and Microsoft: A Company Claims Foul	A new lawsuit is nibbling at the Microsoft Corporation. This one is by a small computer hardware company that says Microsoft stole the design for its mouse. In a suit filed this month in Federal District Court in Austin, Tex., the company, Goldtouch Technologies, charges that Microsoft co-opted the Goldtouch design for the Microsoft Intellimouse Pro. Both mice slope down in front and to the right.
12/28/1998	TECHNOLOGY: Computing's Next Wave Is Nearly at Hand; Imagining the Future in a Post-PC World	At a private meeting with executives of the Intel Corporation in July 1995, William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, sounded a warning. As the companies pursued their joint vision of making desktop machines that could store and crunch ever-increasing amounts of digital data, Mr. Gates predicted that they would face a looming challenge. ''Once networks are extremely fast,'' Mr. Gates said, there will be ''no reason intelligence can't be central,'' according to notes taken by an Intel executive at the meeting, which were submitted as evidence in the Microsoft antitrust trial. Centralized intelligence, accessible via fast computer networks, would pose a threat to the dominant role of PC's -- the model on which Microsoft and Intel have built their lucrative businesses.
12/25/1998	Under Shadow of Antitrust Case, Microsoft Tries to Maintain Its Edge	On the pine-covered campus with its man-made waterfall, much remains the same at Microsoft's world headquarters. The sodas are still free. Employees are encouraged to take breaks by congregating on the many basketball courts or around whimsical game machines, all part of what is known at Microsoft as the ''Sneak ernet,'' the face-to-face contact that company officials say is vital, even as people here spend much of the day communicating via computer. And workers continue to swap stories about the famous ''E-mails from Bill,'' the messages that can pop up at any hour of the day from the company's co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates. One employee in the games group recalls a predawn missive from the leader.
12/21/1998	Compressed Data; Astronauts Get Mail; Microsoft Gets a Foothold	The E-mail revolution has breached another frontier -- space. The space shuttle Endeavour finished a 12-day mission last Tuesday that was the first on which crew members could routinely send and receive E-mail, using notebook computers and ''smart modems'' developed by NASA engineers.
12/20/1998	Gates For Dummies	I've been watching the government's antitrust trial of Bill Gates with grudging admiration -- not for the enormity of Gates's wealth but for how he has realized my adolescent fantasy of financial triumph. I spent much of my youth wondering how to induce every American man, woman and child to send me just one cent. I figured they would never feel the worse for surrendering such a pittance, but the pennies would net me $1.5 million, then a veritable fortune. Gates has improved on my scheme a millionfold. He's got a lot of us paying him more than pennies, often for nothing in return. And he's been angling to collect even larger sums from every trip to the Internet, a toll on the billions of us who will soon buy, sell, watch, hear, read or publish something on the Web.
12/20/1998	The Purpose of Put Warrants	To the Editor: Re ''Financial Engineering 1.0'' (Market Watch, Nov. 22), which discussed how companies including Microsoft sell put warrants to outside investors:
12/20/1998	On-Line Traders: Older, Wiser and Richer	VERY so often, late at night, David L. Woodland steals away to the den of his home in Aberdeen, Wash., so that he can check stock prices on the Internet. Mr. Woodland, a 68-year-old retired insurance salesman, delights at how, with the click of a mouse, he can tap into the facts and fortunes of Wall Street. ''If I get a bright idea late at night,'' Mr. Woodland said, ''I go into the office, fire up the computer and put a buy or sell order in.''
12/18/1998	Microsoft Says It Didn't Alter Internet Site	Stung by a Government witness's testimony that the Microsoft Corporation had sabotaged a program designed to gather evidence against the company, lawyers for the software giant today offered the court an unusual written explanation. Central to the issue are on-line updates, a feature introduced with Windows 98 in June, whereby users who are connected to the Internet receive a ''critical update'' message when they turn on their computers whenever Microsoft has fixed some bug or made some improvement to the operating system. By clicking on a button, the user downloads the new code from a special Web site, and it is instantly installed automatically.
12/17/1998	For Microsoft, Growing Sense Of Isolation On Browsers	The Microsoft Corporation is finding itself increasingly isolated within the computer industry over its view of the natural relationship between Internet software and operating systems, testimony presented today in Federal court showed. While testimony of executives from companies that develop operating systems demonstrated that most now include Internet software with their products, it also made it clear that only Microsoft tied the two together in a way that prevented them from being separated.
12/17/1998	Corrections	A headline in Business Day on Tuesday about a deal between Qwest Communications and Microsoft misstated the purpose. Qwest plans to develop business systems for the Internet that will run on Microsoft's Windows NT operating software. The companies have no joint plan to develop Windows NT.
12/16/1998	Microsoft Denied Access to Scholars' Tapes	Denying the Microsoft Corporation access to the research of two business school professors, a Federal appeals court in Boston ruled unanimously yesterday that scholars should be granted First Amendment privileges similar to those of journalists. Microsoft sought the unpublished notes and tapes of interviews conducted by the professors for use in its defense in the antitrust suit brought by the Government. The suit contends that Microsoft used its market power illegally to thwart competition from its main rival for Internet browsing software, the Netscape Communications Corporation.
12/16/1998	Industry Plan Is Aimed at Selling Music Over the Internet	If all goes according to plan, music fans will be able to buy top hits for electronic delivery through the Internet by Christmas 1999. In a press conference yesterday at the Sony Building in midtown Manhattan (and cybercast through the Internet at www.riaa.com), leaders of the Recording Industry Association of America and chief executives of the five major recording companies said they would work with major technology companies to develop the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a standard for delivery of music over the Internet.
12/16/1998	Trial Reviews More Microsoft Tactics	When employees of the Microsoft Corporation discuss the company's Windows operating system, their language can be extravagant, even imperial. In documents and depositions presented in Federal court today, one described Windows as ''our one unique and valuable asset.'' Another called it ''the crown jewel.'' As the Government's antitrust suit against Microsoft entered its third month today, the Justice Department continued to concentrate on evidence that Microsoft used its monopoly position in operating-system software to have its way in all manner of competitive challenges.
12/15/1998	Microsoft Accused of Sabotaging Witness's Computer Program	A Princeton University computer-science expert today accused the Microsoft Corporation in Federal court of sabotaging a computer program he had written to demonstrate a key point in the Government's antitrust suit against the software giant. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is trying the case in District Court here, became visibly angry at the idea that Microsoft might have taken advantage of information it acquired through the court to sabotage the Government's case.
12/15/1998	Qwest to Develop Windows NT With Microsoft	Hoping to jump-start its corporate software business in Internet and telecommunications markets, the Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that it was investing $200 million in Qwest Communications Inc., the Denver-based company that is building a new fiber optic telephone network around Internet technologies. Microsoft executives said that as part of the deal, they would license their Windows NT 4.0 server software to Qwest. For its part, Qwest said it planned to build a complete Web-host business around the technology, focusing on services like dedicated electronic commerce systems, managed software services and private networks managed and deployed by Qwest.
12/14/1998	If Microsoft Loses Case, Remedies Are Thorny	In the Microsoft trial, witness after witness for the Government has described the big software company's industry-standard Windows operating system as the essential utility of modern computing. To succeed in the marketplace, they explain, a new software product must have access to the Microsoft Corporation's technology if the product is to run smoothly on top of the Windows operating system. Even a rival like the Netscape Communications Corporation, the Internet browser pioneer, must ask for Microsoft's cooperation so that it can compete against Microsoft -- a situation created by Microsoft's broad reach across so many software and Internet commerce markets, from spreadsheets to on-line travel services.
12/14/1998	Oracle Joins Sun in Plan To Challenge Windows	Microsoft's archrivals, Sun Microsystems and Oracle, plan to announce a joint effort on Monday to make corporate computer users less reliant on Microsoft's Windows software. Sun and Oracle intend to create network server computers that users of desktop machines can draw upon for many of their basic computing activities, reducing the need for a full-blown desktop operating system like Windows. The move is also meant to slow the rapid rise of Microsoft's office-network version of Windows, called Windows NT.
12/14/1998	Keeper of the List of All Lists And Voice for Technology's Elite	When David J. Farber stepped down from the public stage of the witness stand in the Microsoft antitrust trial last Wednesday after two days of testimony, he found his own private audience eagerly awaiting his return. And he did not disappoint them. Logging on hours after returning from Washington to his home in Landenburg, Pa., the 64-year-old University of Pennsylvania telecommunications professor dispatched an E-mail message. ''To all those who I have ignored,'' the subject line read. The text of the message went on to say, ''I have never felt so drained.''
12/12/1998	U.S. Witness Says Browser Split Is Feasible	A computer science expert from Princeton University says he has done what the Microsoft Corporation insists is impossible: extricated Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browsing software from its Windows operating system. The expert, Dr. Edward W. Felten, who will take the stand in Federal court on Monday as a witness for the Government in its antitrust suit against Microsoft, was asked by the Justice Department to puncture a central argument in Microsoft's defense -- namely that browser and operating system are inextricably integrated.
12/11/1998	The Microsoft Trial Reviews Dispute With Sun Over Java	The antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation today offered an inside view of the software giant's relationship with Sun Microsystems Inc. that resembled two wary, distrustful scorpions circling each other. The corporations shared an interest in Internet software and a programming language called Java, developed by Sun. Two years ago, Microsoft signed a license agreement with Sun to use the Java technology, but as testimony and E-mail evidence chronicled, there was always more antagonism than cooperation between the two companies.
12/11/1998	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a report in the Patents column of Business Day on Monday about a technology that lets on-line companies pay commissions for customer referrals from other Web sites misidentified the owner of Travelocity, a site that uses it. The owner is AMR, not Microsoft.
12/10/1998	Tripping Over Directions	To the Editor: The mighty Microsoft takes a strange twist in its instructions for how to get rebates for Expedia Trip Planner and Expedia Streets.
12/10/1998	Slick and Expansive, but With a Few Glitches, Too	ENCARTA REFERENCE SUITE 99 (Microsoft, $99.95, before $30 rebate; Windows 95 and 98, and NT.)
12/10/1998	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about Sun Microsystems' new version of the Java programming language misstated the extent of technical cooperation provided by Microsoft to be sure Java works properly on computers using Windows operating software. Microsoft agreed to add to its own version of Java an element known as J.N.I. to comply with a recent Federal Court order. Microsoft has not agreed to add features to Windows that would enhance the performance of Jini, the Java technology distributed by Sun. Because of an editing error, the headline also misstated a change in Sun's strategy for programming development. Sun has moved a step closer toward an ''open source'' model, in which programming work is freely shared. It has not switched to that model.
12/10/1998	It Sounds Nice, but Can It Fix A Flat Tire When You Need It?	Last week the Microsoft Corporation and the Clarion Corporation introduced the Auto PC, a Windows CE-based dashboard computer that uses voice commands to control a digital radio, a CD player, a cellular phone and a navigation system. It also uses voice synthesis to read traffic reports, incoming E-mail and the driver's personal contact directory. The Auto PC is currently available only in California and Washington State, but Microsoft says it will soon be offered nationwide as an option on high-end automobiles, with prices starting at $1,299. PETER H. LEWIS
12/10/1998	Some Language Parsing and More on Java at Microsoft Trial	The Microsoft trial focused today on an esoteric issue that is crucial to the outcome of the antitrust case: What is a computer operating system? The answer is important because the Government contends that the Microsoft Corporation illegally tied its software for browsing the World Wide Web to its industry-standard Windows operating system to stifle competition in the Internet software market. Microsoft says that its browser is not a separate product unfairly tied to Windows but merely a feature of its operating system.
12/9/1998	At the Microsoft Trial, a Day for Parrying	A lawyer for the Microsoft Corporation failed today to shake a computer-science expert from his argument that Internet software should not be included as part of Microsoft's Windows operating system. Central to the Government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is the charge that the company bundled Internet browser software with Windows largely as a tactic to put competitors at a disadvantage.
12/8/1998	Microsoft and Barnes & Noble Join Forces	In a deal that may prove damaging to the Internet's largest bookseller, Amazon.com, the Microsoft Corporation and Barnes & Noble Inc. said yesterday that they had agreed to weave together their on-line products and services. The marketing arrangement makes Barnes & Noble the exclusive bookseller on Microsoft's popular MSN network.
12/8/1998	Gates Criticizes Government's Lawyers for Tone of His Deposition	William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, blamed the Government today for what has been widely perceived as his uncooperative attitude during a videotaped deposition, his first public response to criticism of that testimony. Mr. Gates said that the real problem was with the questions the Government asked him, not the answers he gave.
12/7/1998	For Microsoft, a New Industry Dispute	One evening last month at an impromptu gathering of reporters at the Comdex computer trade show, William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, enthusiastically described a breakthrough technology for improving the readability of text on the flat-panel color displays used on laptop computers. The new technique, which he said would be added to Microsoft's Windows operating system next year, is known as Cleartype, and it makes text on a portable computer almost as readable as a newspaper or a book, Mr. Gates asserted.
12/7/1998	PC Companies And Bells To Petition U.S.	Hoping to offer high-speed Internet access to more consumers, the biggest personal computer and local telephone companies plan to jointly petition the F.C.C. today to relax regulations that they say are impeding network modernization. Microsoft, Intel, Compaq Computer and Gateway plan to join with the Bell local phone companies and GTE to announce their allied effort this morning in Washington, according to executives involved in the group.
12/7/1998	Microsoft Sets Push for Corporate Market	William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, put the matter succinctly while speaking in New York last week. The next battleground for the personal computer industry, he said, is industrial-strength corporate computing -- the lucrative province of hardware and software suppliers like I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and Oracle. The outcome of that battle, according to Mr. Gates, is not much in doubt. He spoke of the supremacy of the ''PC model'' -- hardware and software as separate businesses (Microsoft, of course, dominates the software side). ''The PC model will take over the rest of the industry,'' he declared.
12/4/1998	A New Tack Is Taken By Microsoft	Microsoft's lawyers sought to show in Federal court today that Sun Microsystems Inc., a tough competitor in the software industry, was guilty of the same sort of anti-competitive behavior that had prompted the Federal Government and 20 states to file an antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation. With a Sun executive, James A. Gosling, on the stand, a Microsoft lawyer, Tom Burt, introduced internal E-mail in which Sun executives two years ago described meetings with the Netscape Communications Corporation at which it appeared that the two companies were working toward an agreement not to compete in Internet software.
12/3/1998	Gates Testifies He Knew Little of Microsoft-Sun Legal Battle Over Java	In excerpts from a videotaped deposition played in Federal court today, William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, professed general ignorance of his company's legal battles with Sun Microsystems Inc. over Sun's Java programming language. Asked under oath on Aug. 29 if he was familiar with a civil lawsuit that Sun had recently filed accusing Microsoft of violating its contract to use Java, Mr. Gates paused for nearly 30 seconds before replying, ''Not really.'' Later he said with a shrug, ''I read something about it on our Web site four days ago.''
12/3/1998	Microsoft and CBS Sell Ad Packages	Two advertisers are signing package deals with the Microsoft Corporation and the CBS Corporation. The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company signed a two-year, $7.5 million agreement with Microsoft for Hancock to become what Microsoft describes as the ''premier life insurance sponsor'' on the MSN network of Internet services. The agreement, to be formally announced today, gives Hancock brand exposure with banner ads and other on-line displays on MSN properties like MSNBC, MSN Hotmail and MSN Money Central.
12/3/1998	Gates Serves Up Playful Scorn For Prosecutors and Rivals	The William H. Gates who has appeared on video screens in a Washington courtroom is halting, forgetful, slumped in his chair. As Government lawyers in the antitrust trial that began in October have repeatedly shown excerpts of an August deposition of Mr. Gates, Microsoft Kremlinologists have speculated that the company's long-running confrontation with the Justice Department has left the company's chairman in a depressed funk. But the more familiar Bill Gates of computer industry lore -- sharp, self-confident and combative -- showed up in New York yesterday, serving up equal measures of playful scorn for his prosecutors and his rivals at a luncheon sponsored by the Manhattan Institute, a bastion of libertarian conservatism.
12/3/1998	PUBLIC LIVES	A Softball Question For Mr. Microsoft It was a friendly crowd and a friendly question, but WILLIAM H. GATES resisted the temptation to speak too frankly. Mr. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft and star witness at the Government's antitrust trial, was addressing a luncheon yesterday at the Roosevelt Hotel organized by the Manhattan Institute, a public-policy group more sympathetic to entrepreneurs than Government attorneys.
12/3/1998	Cuddly, Sure, but Smart?	THEY are, rest assured, the only Microsoft products to be tested for excessive hugging. Arthur and D.W. look for all the world like simple stuffed toys based on the aardvarks from PBS's most popular children's show, ''Arthur.'' But these two 21-inch figures, called Actimates, are not just toys: they are furry computer peripherals. Both Arthur and D.W. have roughly 700 internal parts -- including 512 kilobytes of computer memory -- to natter and sing away with a vocabulary of roughly 4,000 words. It's only when you squeeze one of the creature's extremities that it reveals its true nature. ''Do you know what's gross?'' Arthur asks when you squeeze his hand and then his ear in a weird impression of a Masonic handshake. ''Green goop that drips from faucets. That's gross.'' D.W., in return for a handshake, will recite the date and time.
12/2/1998	An Internet company with little freebies that could gains a place in the sun.	LINK EXCHANGE, a two-year-old Internet company that built a large membership by luring Web sites with the offer of free advertising, and then sold advertising to outside companies and products to its members, has clearly reaped its reward. In early November, the Microsoft Corporation bought the company with plans to fold it into the Microsoft Network, the software giant's portal, or gateway page, on the World Wide Web. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but news reports put the value at $250 million in stock.
12/2/1998	Competition on the Net	To the Editor: You argue (editorial, Nov. 25) that America Online and Netscape merged because Microsoft somehow forced Netscape into dissolution, yet you leave out the fact that Netscape sold for more than $4 billion because of the phenomenal growth that both companies see ahead. That's a mighty price and a rosy philosophy for an industry in which you doubt there is sufficient competition.
12/2/1998	Testimony on Microsoft's League of Its Own	At an industry meeting in February 1997, an official of the Microsoft Corporation vowed that his company ''wouldn't be cowboys'' by altering the Java programming language on its own, an executive of Sun Microsystems Inc. said in testimony released today. Seven months later, he testified, Microsoft did just that, in an effort to eliminate ''the threat posed by Java technology to Microsoft's operating system monopoly.'' In direct written testimony made public today, Dr. James A. Gosling, a vice president of Sun and the chief scientist of its Java software division, opened a new line of attack by the Justice Department in its antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft: the company's move to tailor its version of Java for its Windows operating system, making it incompatible with the standard Java language developed by Sun.
12/2/1998	Gates Case Made In E-Mail to Staff	In an E-mail to his executive staff today, William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, said that the Government's antitrust case was seriously undercut by America Online's planned $4.2 billion purchase of the Netscape Communications Corporation. The Government, he wrote, ''must be VERY dismayed at this merger,'' because it proved that Microsoft's move to give its browser away was not predatory pricing but a recognition of its ''competitive price, which is zero.''
12/1/1998	Microsoft Defense Strategy Starts to Come Into Focus	In a day of prickly, detailed cross-examination at Microsoft's antitrust trial, Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, an economist, summed up the Government's case of how the software giant wields its market power in the industry. ''Microsoft cannot point a gun to people's heads,'' Mr. Warren-Boulton said in response to a question from Microsoft's lawyer, ''but they can make them an offer they can't refuse.''
11/30/1998	The power-drunk high-technology world seems to be trying to one-up itself in the cynicism department.	NO matter how cynical you become, it's never enough to keep up.'' That aphorism, a sage comment on the absurdities of 1980's culture, was written by Jane Wagner for the actress Lily Tomlin, in their 1985 Broadway hit, ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe.''
11/29/1998	Competition and the Internet	To the Editor: You argue that ''Microsoft has bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale to America Online'' (editorial, Nov. 25). You call a $4.2 billion stock swap a distress sale?

11/29/1998	Competition and the Internet	To the Editor: You argue that competition in the computer software industry must be preserved (editorial, Nov. 25). However, your suggestion that the Justice Department ''vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft'' means crippling one of the industry's competitors.
11/26/1998	3-Way Alliance May Prove A Real Threat to Microsoft	Eight years ago Apple Computer and I.B.M. undertook a common software and computer chip development effort to challenge the Microsoft Corporation's dominance of personal computing and remake the computing industry at home and in the workplace. Three years later the alliance was in a shambles, shaken by internal turmoil and ignored by the market. Indeed, during the last decade the failure of large corporate technology alliances seems to be the rule rather than the exception.
11/25/1998	Competition on the Internet	America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields. But it does not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software. The department has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in other software realms. The Internet has risen so quickly as an information medium that only four years ago, in his book ''The Road Ahead,'' Bill Gates scarcely mentions it. In addition, only a couple of years ago America Online, the world's biggest on-line service, was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely derided as ''America On Hold.'' Now Microsoft has moved so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing it of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward to make deals with other Internet players.
11/24/1998	Conquering the Internet	With its proposed purchase of the Netscape Communications Corporation, America Online Inc., the nation's largest on-line service, hopes to beat the Microsoft Corporation in the race for dominance of on-line media and electronic commerce. If the $4 billion deal is completed -- the companies had not reached agreement as of last night -- America Online would acquire a leading Internet brand and enlarge its wired audience by absorbing the millions who visit Netscape's popular Net Center site on the World Wide Web.
11/24/1998	Gates Gives Millions To Seattle Libraries	William H. Gates, the Microsoft Corporation chairman, and his wife, Melinda, will give $20 million to the Seattle Public Library system on Tuesday, officials of the William H. Gates Foundation said today. The gift is believed to be one of the largest donations from individuals to a public library system. The donation will provide $15 million to expand neighborhood libraries; $4 million to support additions to the book collection, and $1 million to support literacy, English as a second language and other programs.
11/24/1998	Microsoft Says Proposed Netscape Deal Supports Its Case	The Microsoft Corporation argued in Federal court today that the proposed acquisition of the Netscape Communications Corporation by America Online seriously undermined the Government's antitrust suit against the software giant. ''From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the Government,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, said this morning on the courthouse steps.
11/23/1998	NETSCAPE BID SEEN BY AMERICA ONLINE	America Online Inc. is on the verge of agreeing to purchase the Netscape Communications Corporation, the Internet pioneer at the center of the Government's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation, executives involved in the talks said yesterday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving America Online, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. America Online, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business. America Online would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to thousands of users at the same time.
11/20/1998	Microsoft Accused of Keeping Prices Artificially High	The Microsoft Corporation has kept the price of personal computer software ''significantly'' higher than would be expected if the company faced real competition, an economic consultant testified today in the Microsoft trial. Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, an economist and Government witness, did not estimate precisely how much higher Microsoft has kept prices because of its monopoly power, but he asserted that it was ''significantly above 5 percent.''
11/19/1998	On Its Own Turf, It's Microsoft, Right or Wrong	Just as President Nixon found support among construction workers during the Vietnam War, it is here in the PC-filled aisles of the Microsoft Partner's Pavilion at the heart of the sprawling Comdex computer trade show that the Microsoft Corporation's besieged chairman, William H. Gates, finds his staunchest supporters. Like Nixon's defenders, whose rallying cry was ''My country, right or wrong,'' many of these digital hard hats today say that Mr. Gates is the victim of a conspiracy. His enemies, they say, competitors who have lost in the marketplace, turned to the Government to save them when their products failed.
11/19/1998	Microsoft Plans To Continue Java Support	The Microsoft Corporation has decided ''absolutely'' to continue to support the Java programming language in the wake of a ruling on Tuesday in which a Federal judge ordered the company to change its Java software, a Microsoft executive said yesterday. In a preliminary ruling, the judge found that Microsoft had violated its licensing contract with Sun Microsystems Inc., inventor of the Java language, by altering it so it was tailored for Microsoft's Windows and incompatible with Sun's Java technology.
11/19/1998	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about a Federal court order that stops Microsoft from shipping its own version of Sun Microsystems' Java programming language misstated the year the companies signed a licensing agreement at issue in their dispute. It was March 1996, not 1995.
11/19/1998	Java's Universality Is a Threat to Microsoft	Why is Java such a big deal? Java, the programming language at issue in the contract dispute between the Microsoft Corporation and Sun Microsystems, is fundamentally different from other computer languages like C, C++, Pascal or Basic.
11/19/1998	Microsoft Quits A Media Venture	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it would sell its 10 percent stake in Real Networks Inc. in a move to compete head to head against the company, which is the market leader in technology that sends sound and video over the Internet. Microsoft said it would begin immediately selling the stake, valued at $129 million.
11/18/1998	A Little Judicial Humor On the Computer's Gender	The Microsoft trial is not all fireworks by any means. There are long stretches of tedium and droning testimony on the dry technical details of computing. To lighten things up, United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson began the afternoon session here today by saying that the court is on ''some E-mail humor list.'' He then read the computer humor entry he thought amusing.
11/18/1998	Microsoft Hampered OS/2, I.B.M. Official Tells Court	A senior I.B.M. executive accused the Microsoft Corporation today of imposing contract restrictions on software developers that prevented OS/2, I.B.M's computer operating system, from effectively competing with Microsoft Windows. John Soyring, director of network computing software for the International Business Machines Corporation, took the witness stand this afternoon in the Government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. In the early 1990's, he was in charge of developing OS/2.
11/18/1998	Novell and Cisco Set Broad Compatibility Accord	The Novell Corporation and the Cisco Corporation, two major players in the computer networking industry, will announce Wednesday that they have agreed to make their software and hardware broadly compatible. The move is seen as a victory for Novell in its effort to halt the advances of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows NT, an operating system that incorporates office networking technologies, a market that Novell once dominated.
11/17/1998	PUBLIC LIVES	They Call Gates Bet-a-Hundred The Microsoft antitrust trial drones on in Washington. But the main figure in the case, WILLIAM H. GATES, the chairman of Microsoft, was living it up 2,091 miles away, in Las Vegas, Nev. As a low roller.
11/17/1998	Excerpts From Gates Deposition at Antitrust Trial	Following are excerpts from an hour of videotaped testimony shown today in United States District Court during antitrust proceedings against Microsoft. David Boies and other lawyers for the Justice Department questioned the chairman and chief executive of the company, William H. Gates.
11/17/1998	On Tape, Gates Seems Puzzled by Words Like 'Market Share'	William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, stubbornly debated the meaning of words like ''we'' and ''concern'' during an hour of his videotaped deposition shown in court today. Even ''market share'' seemed a curiously alien term to a man whose company owns just about all of the market in major product categories of the personal computer software business. Most significant for the antitrust case against his company, Mr. Gates said that he did not recall what he was thinking or what he meant when he wrote in a January 1996 E-mail to top aides, ''Winning Internet browser market share is a very, very important goal for us.''
11/17/1998	Microsoft Develops Software to Improve Appearance of Screen Text	Microsoft Corporation researchers have developed a software technique that improves the appearance of fonts displayed on color liquid-crystal display screens to a level that approaches the visual quality of text printed on paper. The announcement of the new technology, which could help spawn a generation of portable devices for publishing electronic books and periodicals, was the centerpiece of a presentation by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, on Sunday here at the Comdex computer industry trade show.
11/16/1998	Depth of Rift Over Software Is Disclosed	The Microsoft trial is not merely a legal prizefight. With its parade of witnesses and mountains of documents, it has opened a window to the inner workings of the Microsoft Corporation and how it deals with the rest of the computer industry, raw material for a digital-age ''Dynasty.'' Last week's episode: Family Feud.
11/16/1998	When E-Mail Shows Up in Court	To the Editor: Re ''Corporate Delete Keys Busy as E-Mail Turns Up in Court'' (front page, Nov. 11): Exploiting a witness's prior statements is a time-honored trial tactic. Statements made in E-mail, faxes, recordings from telephone answering machines and even deposition transcripts are all likely to surprise an ill-prepared witness. If E-mail seems to pose a special problem, there is no need to teach the law to appreciate its context. Through corporate policy, experience and the ubiquity of the technology, the public will learn that E-mail is more and less permanent than it seems. Context matters long before we take an oath as a witness. The lesson of the Microsoft antitrust trial -- that we should think before we write and speak -- is not merely valuable for the sake of corporate policy but is, one might say, a good thing. MICHAEL MADISON Pittsburgh, Nov. 11, 1998 The writer is a visiting law professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
11/16/1998	Oracle Data Base Takes Aim at Windows	Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of the Oracle Corporation and longtime foe of Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, failed in his first effort to undermine the dominance of the Windows family of operating systems with a concept called the network computer. Now, he has struck upon a new strategy that would do away with the operating system almost entirely on the powerful computers known as servers that act as the control centers of large networks.
11/16/1998	Where Does Microsoft Want You To Go Today?; The New Strategy: Keep Web Surfers Busy With a Series Of MSN Sites	Haven't we seen this screen before? The latest Internet initiative from the Microsoft Corporation is an all-in-one service that combines news, information, shopping, bulletin boards and electronic mail. Even its name sounds familiar: MSN.
11/16/1998	When E-Mail Shows Up in Court	To the Editor: Re ''Corporate Delete Keys Busy as E-Mail Turns Up in Court'' (front page, Nov. 11): Even the most novice of Web surfer is aware of the pitfalls of E-mail. I think that Microsoft executives, whose E-mail has turned up as evidence in the Justice Department's antitrust case, knew better but simply did not care about what they said or wrote (a known human failing).
11/15/1998	With a Friend Like Microsoft . . .	The Microsoft antitrust trial has shifted from how William H. Gates and company treat their enemies to how they treat their friends. An Intel vice president, Steven McGeady, testified that Microsoft bullied Intel into shelving its own software development with repeated threats that Microsoft would stop supporting new generations of Intel microprocessors. He described Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, as becoming ''enraged'' at Intel for daring to encroach on territory Microsoft claimed as its own. Microsoft's lawyers said Mr. McGeady was distorting a close and cooperative relationship between Microsoft and Intel. The lawyers said Microsoft had not tried to stifle competition, but that it had urged Intel to abandon software development because Intel was doing it badly.
11/14/1998	Microsoft Is Said to Irk Some Big Users	Some of the nation's largest companies, including Citibank and Federal Express, view the Microsoft Corporation's strategy of integrating Internet software with the Windows operating system as a costly inconvenience with few benefits, according to an independent consultant serving as an expert witness in the Government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. Microsoft's decision to tie its Web browser to the operating system lies at the core of the Government's lawsuit. The company argues that integrating software for browsing the World Wide Web is a natural evolution for personal-computer operating systems -- and a vital competitive step.
11/13/1998	Microsoft Tries to Discredit Intel Executive	Lawyers for the Microsoft Corporation made a broad and aggressive attempt today to discredit an Intel executive who has emerged as an important Government witness, portraying him as a resentful employee and introducing testimony from his own supervisor that differed from his memory of events. In testimony early this week, Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president, said William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and other Microsoft executives, had threatened Intel's leaders in 1995 as part of a successful effort to push them out of the software-development business, and to dissuade them from supporting the Netscape Communications Corporation, Microsoft's major competitor in the market for Internet software.
11/12/1998	Microsoft's New Turf: Digital Speakers	First it just made software. Then it made mice, joysticks and telephones. Now the company that gave the world the Windows operating system is getting into the speaker market. The Microsoft Corporation plans to sell the Digital Sound System 80, a pair of PC speakers that it insists will better take advantage of (surprise) its own Windows 98 system. The reason is the speakers are designed to be compatible with features in Windows 98 and work with a type of data transmission called Universal Serial Bus that is built into newer computers.
11/11/1998	Corporate Delete Keys Busy As E-Mail Turns Up in Court	Employees at Amazon.com, the popular on-line bookseller, recently received a directive from senior management that struck some as out of character in a company that had sprouted from the Internet's free-for-all culture. As part of an event that the Seattle-based company designated ''Sweep and Keep,'' employees were instructed to purge, among other things, E-mail messages that were no longer required for business or not subject to legal records requirements. Free lattes would be dispensed in the cafeteria to those who complied immediately, the directive said.
11/11/1998	Gates Quoted As Seeing Case 'Blow Over'	William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, confidently told a group of industry executives in 1995 that the Government's antitrust investigation of his company would ''blow over'' with scant effect, an executive who attended the private meeting testified in court today. And although Microsoft had signed a consent decree with the Government a year earlier agreeing to alter its software licensing deals with personal computer makers, Mr. Gates was also quoted as saying that the company had not really changed its business practices.
11/11/1998	Microsoft Media Chief to Take a Leave	The executive who has led the Microsoft Corporation's difficult foray into the world of interactive media and Internet content is taking a leave, and the company said yesterday that he would return to a different job next year. Pete Higgins, 40, vice president of the Interactive Media Group at Microsoft since late 1996, has been one of the closest lieutenants of William H. Gates, the chairman. But his most recent assignment, to try to make the company a dominant player in the world of new media, has had disappointing financial results.
11/10/1998	A Microsoft Rebuttal but Nothing to Rebut	Expecting the Government to play a damaging videotape in Federal court today, executives of the Microsoft Corporation summoned reporters to an early morning news conference to offer an advance rebuttal in the form of their own videotape. The Government's videotape, Microsoft feared, would purport to demonstrate that Microsoft had -- in the words of an Apple Computer executive -- ''sabotaged'' Apple's Quicktime multimedia player.
11/10/1998	An Intel Executive Testifies of a 'Credible and Fairly Terrifying' Threat by Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation repeatedly threatened its key ally in the computer industry, the Intel Corporation, as part of its campaign to stifle any challenge to its business posed by the rise of the Internet, an Intel executive testified in court today. Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president, testified that Microsoft had threatened to pull back from supporting new Intel microprocessors unless Intel shelved its own software efforts and favored Microsoft over Internet software rivals like the Netscape Communications Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc.
11/9/1998	Compressed Data; One Trademark Lawsuit That Microsoft May Avoid	Bob Kerstein, a former McCaw Cellular Communications executive who is now an Internet entrepreneur in Falls Church, Va., says he has no interest in tangling with Microsoft over use of the term ''Windows 2000.'' But there are plenty of people who want to help him try. After the trade publication Client Server News disclosed last week that he had both the trademark Windows2000 and the domain name www.windows2000.com, Mr. Kerstein received more than 100 messages in one day from people congratulating him and, in many cases, offering to help him capitalize on the name. ''People keep telling me I've won the lottery,'' Mr. Kerstein said.
11/9/1998	Disarming a Giant: U.S. Case Stresses Anticompetitive Pattern by Microsoft	As its antitrust trial moves into the fourth week, the Microsoft Corporation finds itself trying to deflect a flood of charges of threats and bribes. The litany of shameful misconduct, according to the Government, was directed not only at Microsoft's rivals but just about everyone in the industry -- including personal computer makers, Internet service suppliers and others. The Justice Department's story line is that, time after time, the digital-age monopolist showed up in the doorway, brandishing a club in one hand while offering price discounts and marketing support with the other. It is, as an antitrust expert said, an ''800-pound gorilla'' case certainly entertaining, but is it a strong legal case?
11/9/1998	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the videotaped testimony of William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, seen via the Internet, referred incompletely to his role in the evolution of the Net. While he has helped propagate it in recent years, Mr. Gates was a late and reluctant convert. Until 1996, he tried to thwart the Internet's growing popularity by developing a private on-line service and software for it.
11/6/1998	Judge in Microsoft Case Tries to Cut Through Jargon as He Questions Witness	Exhibiting increasing frustration with the slow pace of the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation, and with the sometimes incomprehensible techno-jargon, the presiding judge stepped forcefully into the courtroom proceedings today, repeatedly rebuking Microsoft's lawyer and then asking the witness, an Apple Computer Company executive, a long series of questions that went directly to the heart of the case. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court is both judge and jury in this case, and he has made clear over the course of the trial that he is not a technophile. He has also shown impatience with Microsoft's long and often tedious cross-examination of Government witnesses.
11/5/1998	Microsoft's Latest: A Telephone	THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION does not go softly into hardware. When it decides to enter a hardware niche, it typically has a good reason. The rise of graphical user interfaces like the Windows shell demanded a mouse, and Microsoft is now the big cheese in computer mice. Microsoft's game-software division is a powerhouse, so the company is trying to conquer the market for game paraphernalia like joysticks, steering wheels and stereo speakers. William H. Gates became a daddy, and now there is the Microsoft Actimates Interactive Barney doll. And now Microsoft is going after the cordless phone business, which says a lot about the company's vision for the future. It is a future that blends telecommunications, consumer electronics and computing, and it envisions increasing reliance on voice commands to control common household devices -- that, not coincidentally, use Microsoft operating systems.
11/5/1998	Browser Memos Pose Challenge To Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation was so worried about the Netscape Communications Corporation's lead in Internet software last year that its senior executives wanted to delay an upgrade of the Windows operating system to gain an edge in the browser battle, according to internal Microsoft documents released this week by the Government. The linchpin of Microsoft's defense in its antitrust trial is that its Internet Explorer, or I.E., browser is a seamless feature of Windows -- not, as the Government contends, a separate product bundled with Windows in an effort to give it an unfair advantage against Netscape. The origins of its product strategy, Microsoft asserts, date back more than four years to a meeting of its executives in April 1994.
11/5/1998	Microsoft Defends Tactics In 1997 Talks With Apple	The Microsoft Corporation argued in court today that it had every right to tell Apple Computer last year that it would stop producing word processors and other software for Macintosh computers unless Apple adopted Microsoft's Internet browser as the default choice on all its computers. ''Suppose Microsoft simply decides not to offer a product,'' said Theodore Edelman, a Microsoft lawyer. ''Do you have a problem with that?''
11/5/1998	Microsoft Said to Pursue On-Line Deal	In a further refinement of its on-line media efforts, the Microsoft Corporation plans to acquire Linkexchange Inc., a closely held Internet-advertising firm, in a stock deal valued about $250 million, according to people close to the companies. Linkexchange, based in San Francisco, has become one of the best-known Internet-advertising networks, a class of new-media companies that sell banner promotions on World Wide Web sites to reach the largest possible audience. Linkexchange alone places ad banners on about 400,000 Web sites, though many of those sites are obscure personal home pages.
11/3/1998	Taking in the (Web) Site Of This Virtual Defense	In the dry paper trail of depositions, it was simply Government exhibit No. 1,400, recorded in August. But on the Internet of real life today, No. 1,400 turned out to be the man himself, William H. Gates, Microsoft mogul under fire, suddenly appearing in watery living color, his recorded image slightly dreamlike but definitely in motion above the keyboard, his voice firm in fencing with his inquisitors for all the world's surfers to witness, virtually. ''I don't know anything more than what it says in the E-mail,'' Mr. Gates -- his color image slightly tattered, but slightly glowing, too -- could be seen and heard declaring from computer screens at midafternoon for anyone who managed to finally join the crowd on the TechWeb site for the special presentation headlined ''Microsoft on Trial.''
11/3/1998	Gates on Tape: Scant Memory Of Key Details	The William H. Gates on the courtroom screen this afternoon was evasive and uninformed, pedantic and taciturn -- a world apart from his reputation as a brilliant business strategist, guiding every step in the Microsoft Corporation's rise to dominance in computing. In two hours of videotaped questioning selected by Justice Department lawyers from their 20-hour deposition of Mr. Gates last summer, Microsoft's chairman professed ignorance of key meetings and strategies that lie at the heart of charges in the Government's antitrust suit against his company. These included purported plans to bully competitors like Apple Computer Inc. and the Netscape Communications Corporation into abandoning Internet software markets that Microsoft sought to dominate.
11/3/1998	Excerpts From Videotape of the Gates Deposition Played in the Courtroom	Following are excerpts from two hours of videotaped testimony shown today in United States District Court during antitrust proceedings against the Microsoft Corporation. David Boies, a trial lawyer for the Justice Department, questioned the chairman and chief executive of the company, William H. Gates.
11/3/1998	An Internal Memo Shows Microsoft Executives' Concern Over Free Software	An internal memorandum reflecting the views of some of Microsoft's top executives and software development managers reveals deep concern about the threat of the free software movement and proposes a number of strategies for competing against free programs that have recently been gaining in popularity. The memo warns that free software can meet or exceed the quality of commercial programs and describes it as a potentially serious threat to Microsoft.
11/2/1998	Antitrust Case Is Highlighting Role of E-Mail	The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, but one thing is already clear: this is the first major E-mail trial. The Government's prosecution and the Microsoft Corporation's defense, to a striking degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages. The human testimony often pales next to the E-mail evidence. On the stand or in videotaped testimony, the people being questioned shrug, mumble and forget. The E-mail is alive with ideas and competitive zeal, punctuated with profanity and exclamation points.
11/1/1998	In Microsoft Case, a Lot Of Not Very Much	MOORE'S LAW -- which holds that the speed of computing doubles every 18 months -- is a concept that is hopelessly alien to the practice of law. The Government's antitrust lawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation wound up its second week in Federal District Court in Washington on Friday, and the case, which was originally expected to be argued in a month's time, now looks as though it might drag on until close to Christmas.
11/1/1998	Victor? Villain? Victim? Microsoft on Trial	The epic courtroom battle between the Justice Department and Microsoft has now ground through eight days in court, and the defense's strategy seems to take new twists daily. Microsoft's lawyers, cross-examining the Government's star witness, James L. Barksdale, president of Netscape Communications, spent several days trying to make Netscape out as a crybaby unable to stand the rough-and-tumble of a business battle fought hard but clean by Microsoft. When that approach found little traction, the defense tried to paint a crucial 1995 meeting between Microsoft and Netscape executives as a ''setup'' meant to entrap Microsoft into incriminating itself.
10/31/1998	Apple Executive Testifies of Threats and Bullying by Microsoft	Shortly after Avadis Tevanian Jr. joined Apple Computer Inc. as a senior executive last year, he recalls, a software developer warned him that if Apple did not stop selling its highly successful Quicktime multimedia software product, ''Microsoft would take any necessary action to drive Apple out of businesss.'' Eighteen months later, ''I appreciate the prophetic import of his words,'' Dr. Tevanian stated in written testimony as a Government witness in the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation.
10/30/1998	Not Showing This Week: Gates's Taped Testimony	Two blocks away, on Capitol Hill, it would have been called a filibuster. At the Federal courthouse, however, it was simply a defensive strategy. In pursuing a laborious cross-examination of the second witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial, lawyers for the company foiled plans by the Justice Department to close the week with the much-anticipated -- and in Microsoft's case, much-dreaded -- videotaped questioning of the company's chairman, William H. Gates.
10/30/1998	In Eighth Day, Microsoft Trial Slows Its Pace	In its eighth day, the Microsoft antitrust trial shifted into a slower gear as a senior executive of America Online was led through a painstaking cross-examination in which he was asked to define technical acronyms and parse the fine print of contract terms. By the end of the day, the Microsoft Corporation's defense team had made a few points and scored one clear victory -- it had dragged the cross-examination out so long that the Government did not have time to show videotaped testimony from the company's chairman William H. Gates. Though not scheduled to appear in person, Mr. Gates is the absent star. In the opening session last week, the Government used a few minutes of the lengthy taped deposition, showing an apparently uncomfortable Mr. Gates saying he was not involved in planning moves Microsoft made in the Internet software market that the Justice Department asserts were illegal.
10/29/1998	Play 'What If,' But Plan To Skip Tour	MICROSOFT MONEY FINANCIAL SUITE 99 (Microsoft, $64.95 after $25 rebate, through Nov. 30, 1999; Windows 95, 98 or NT.)
10/29/1998	Wireless Alliance Prepares to Oppose Microsoft	Cementing an alliance intended to block the Microsoft Corporation from dominating new consumer communications markets, Motorola Inc. said yesterday that it had completed an investment in a European joint venture that is developing an operating system for a future generation of digital wireless phones. The alliance, known as Symbian, was originally announced in June. It already has the backing of the two largest European makers of wireless phones -- Nokia of Finland and Ericsson A.B. of Sweden -- as well as Psion P.L.C., a British maker of hand-held digital devices. Symbian's purpose is to license and promote as an industry standard Psion's Epoc operating system, the basic software to run the microprocessors that will power the next generation of wireless phones.
10/29/1998	Mac OS Is Better Than Ever	HOW unfortunate that 95 out of 100 personal computer buyers might not care that Mac OS 8.5, Apple Computer's new operating system software for Macintosh computers, is easier to use, more elegant, more innovative and more reliable than Windows 98. But for the nearly 5 percent -- Apple's current share of new computer sales -- who do care, and for the unknown percentage of computer owners who may be frustrated with the industry-standard Windows operating system, the good news is that Mac OS 8.5 is now available, as a $99 upgrade package for Macs of recent vintage or as the default system on new Apple computers. Mac OS 8.5 is certainly a better operating system than earlier versions of the Mac OS and, in some ways, for some users, better than Windows. It is not free of headaches, of course, and an operating system upgrade should never, ever be taken lightly. Several of my favorite older applications crashed when introduced to the new OS.
10/29/1998	U.S. Describes Microsoft Fight To Secure Ally	Firsthand testimony from a senior executive at America Online and new documents introduced in court today provided an extraordinarily detailed portrait of the Microsoft Corporation's campaign to thwart a planned partnership between the nation's largest on-line service and the Netscape Communications Corporation, Microsoft's rival in the Internet software market. Microsoft's main weapon in the campaign, the Government contends in its antitrust suit, was offering America Online a prime place on the desktop of its industry-standard Windows operating system. That deal, the Justice Department contends, is an example of how Microsoft illegally used the market power derived from its monopoly in operating-system software to stifle competition in the market for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
10/28/1998	In Its Case Against Microsoft, U.S. Now Cites Note From Apple	After four days spent watching lawyers for the Microsoft Corporation attack its key witness, the Justice Department today introduced a host of new documents, videotaped depositions and fresh testimony to strengthen its antitrust case and undermine Microsoft's defenses. Among the new evidence potentially most damaging to Microsoft was a handwritten note describing what the Government portrays as strong-arm tactics Microsoft successfully employed to force Apple Computer Inc. to ship Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, with Macintosh computers.
10/28/1998	Microsoft Deal For Banc One	The Microsoft Corporation has signed a five-year, $90 million agreement with the First USA unit of the Banc One Corporation that is being described as the largest such deal involving Internet advertising. The agreement, to be formally announced today, makes First USA, based in Wilmington, Del., the exclusive credit card advertiser on most of the on-line programs and services on Microsoft's MSN network. Banner ads and other on-line displays asking computer users to apply for Visa and Mastercard credit cards issued by First USA are to appear on MSN properties like MSNBC, Hotmail, Carpoint and Expedia.
10/28/1998	Microsoft Places a Large Bet On Tiny Smart Cards System	The Microsoft Corporation introduced a tiny computer-operating system for smart cards yesterday as well as support for the system from 20 hardware makers. Smart cards contain microchips that store personal or financial data, allowing access while securing the information from unauthorized use. They are already used widely in Europe in digital mobile phones, prepaid telephone cards and bank cards.
10/27/1998	At Trial, Microsoft Says Key Meeting Was a Setup	Opening a new line of defense in its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corporation today portrayed a meeting that is a focal point in the Government's case as a ''setup'' orchestrated by its Internet software rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation. Microsoft based that claim on the fact that the Justice Department issued a civil subpoena to Netscape the day after the meeting, on June 21, 1995, and that two days later Government lawyers received a reply from a Netscape lawyer.
10/27/1998	Sun Microsystems Introducing A New Version of Unix Today	Sun Microsystems Inc. plans to introduce a new version of its Solaris operating system on Tuesday in an effort to capitalize on delays by the Microsoft Corporation in its newest version of the Windows NT operating system. The new Solaris program -- Sun's version of the Unix operating system for its Sparc microprocessor and for Intel Corporation-based servers, has gained an increasing share of Unix business in the last year, largely based on the growth of the Internet server and enterprise computing market.
10/26/1998	Corrections	A front-page article on Wednesday about the Government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft misidentified the native state of James L. Barksdale, chief executive of Netscape Communications. It is Mississippi, not Louisiana.
10/26/1998	Compressed Data; A Few Quirks Exposed In the Microsoft Trial	In Microsoft's view, the Government's antitrust suit represents ''a return of the Luddites,'' the English workers who first tried to stop the advance of industrialization in 1811 by smashing new machines that were being used to manufacture socks. But in court last week, it was Microsoft's lawyer who seemed to be a follower of the movement's mythical leader, King Ludd.
10/26/1998	Higher-Speed Internet Standard Is Approved	Even as Microsoft battles the United States Government, it can celebrate an incremental victory in the internaional arena. Nine months ago, Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Intel joined with the large local phone companies in an effort to enable consumers to receive Internet data over regular telephone lines at speeds much faster than currently possible.
10/26/1998	Microsoft Refrain: Who Was Harmed?	The Microsoft Corporation's defense in the antitrust trial that began last week boils down to one question: Where's the harm? John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, never quite uttered those words. But he nonetheless posed the question in hundreds of ways in his raspy baritone drawl during the three days that he cross-examined the Government's lead witness, James L. Barksdale, the president and chief executive of the Netscape Communications Corporation.
10/25/1998	Ideas & Trends; Top of the World. (For Now.)	WILL it matter to consumers that William H. Gates isn't a nice guy? Until last week, most Americans thought of Mr. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, as a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps -- but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer.
10/25/1998	Microsoft and I.B.M.	To the Editor: T. J. Rodgers (''What's Good for Microsoft . . .,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 20) says the Justice Department's 13-year case against I.B.M. was a failure. Not true. It changed the way I.B.M. did business. I.B.M. stumbled into the 1990's a different, better company as it tried to adjust to the new way it had to do business. The deal Bill Gates cut with I.B.M that allowed Microsoft to sell its operating system to I.B.M. competitors would never have happened without the lawsuit. Before the I.B.M. PC, there were many different PC-type systems running a variety of operating systems with no standard or single platform.
10/25/1998	Even Amid a High-Tech Revolution, Evolution Is the Norm	THE New Economy is on trial here along with the Microsoft Corporation. Sure, the company is the one in the dock. But the outcome of the case against Microsoft will establish the ground rules for how the doctrine of antitrust will apply to high-technology fields like computer software. And the software industry is seen as being at the forefront of new patterns of behavior by workers, companies and markets that define the New Economy.
10/23/1998	Microsoft Disputes Netscape Meeting Account	A lawyer for the Microsoft Corporation today portrayed the company's competitor in the Internet software business, the Netscape Communications Corporation, as a willing and eager participant in deal-making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which the Government and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered to divide the market. That meeting and the accusation of an illegal offer to divide the market for Internet browsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web, are central elements of the antitrust suit by the Justice Department and 20 states being heard in United States District Court here.
10/23/1998	Was Microsoft Bundling, or Was It Bullying?; Question for Court	To the Editor: The question for the court is this: Is Microsoft's Windows 95 a single, monolithic product, with Internet Explorer inextricably designed in? Or is it simply the packaging of an operating system, network services manager, browser and so on?
10/23/1998	Was Microsoft Bundling, or Was It Bullying?; Damage to Free Market	To the Editor: T. J. Rodgers, the chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor, forgoes the sordid business of a Justice Department wiretap by confessing that all Silicon Valley companies, including Cypress, ''do business just like Microsoft'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 20).
10/23/1998	Was Microsoft Bundling, or Was It Bullying?; Guarding Consumers?	To the Editor: To suggest, as T. J. Rodgers does (Op-Ed, Oct. 20), that the case against Microsoft pivots on his straw-man version of an anti-tying argument misses the mark. Contrary to what Mr. Rodgers seems to think, while all technology companies tie products and drop prices, few need worry about Government intervention.
10/23/1998	Was Microsoft Bundling, or Was It Bullying?; A Gainer, Not a Loser	To the Editor: Re ''What's Good for Microsoft . . .,'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 20): T. J. Rodgers would have us believe that Microsoft is the victim of a coercive Government when the opposite is true. Microsoft is one of the prime beneficiaries of a body of economic regulations -- the international system of patent, trademark and copyright laws -- that limit the ability of Microsoft's competitors to use (or improve) technology developed by Microsoft.
10/23/1998	Was Microsoft Bundling, or Was It Bullying?; Rewarding Complainers	To the Editor: To T. J. Rodgers (Op-Ed, Oct. 20), I can only say yes! But I'm afraid that no one wants to hear what you're trying to say. We're just going to have to suffer the consequences of punishing successful technology companies and rewarding complainers like James Barksdale of Netscape and Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems. JEFFREY B. KRIEGER Greer, S.C., Oct. 21, 1998
10/22/1998	Microsoft's Monopoly	To the Editor: Re ''What's Good for Microsoft . . .'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 20): T. J. Rodgers incorrectly compares steps taken by his company, Cypress Semiconductor, to improve hardware by ''bundling'' components to Microsoft's bundling of its World Wide Web browser to its operating system.
10/22/1998	Memos Released in Sun-Microsoft Suit	Documents released today in the Microsoft Corporation's second major legal front -- the lawsuit filed by its rival Sun Microsystems -- include E-mail messages and internal memos certain to embarrass both parties. The internal documents are being made public in a contract suit Sun filed last year against Microsoft. Sun is accusing Microsoft of altering and co-opting its Java programming language -- and thus undermining a potential threat to the dominance of the Windows operating system -- in violation of a technology licensing pact between the two companies.
10/22/1998	Microsoft Uses E-Mail From Netscape to Contest Antitrust Case	Trying to refute a central accusation in the Government's antitrust case, the Microsoft Corporation produced a secret E-mail message today from the chairman of the Netscape Communications Corporation seeking Microsoft's cooperation, offering to stay out of its way and suggesting that Microsoft invest in Netscape. The E-mail, written on Dec. 29, 1994, was introduced to suggest that it was Netscape, not Microsoft, that initiated some of the elements of what the Government portrays as an illegal offer by Microsoft in June 1995 to divide with Netscape the market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
10/21/1998	Back in Redmond, Microsoft's Profit Machine Keeps Humming	Demonstrating yet again the power of its franchise, the Microsoft Corporation reported yesterday that its quarterly earnings had risen 58 percent over their level a year earlier, far exceeding Wall Street estimates. Microsoft, the world's leading maker of computer software, said demand for the Windows 98 operating system exceeded its projections, particularly in Japan and Europe.
10/21/1998	Giant Has New Ideas for On-Line Guides	The Microsoft Corporation is expected to introduce today a makeover of Sidewalk, its on-line city guide, in an ambitious effort to create on-line advertising vehicles for dozens of local products and services, ranging from nannies to new refrigerators. The free service, previewed by reporters on Monday, gives visitors access to consumer buying guides, comparative price information and the names and locations of local merchants. Microsoft says the new service is intended to minimize the frustrations of shopping on line.
10/21/1998	Microsoft Says Antitrust Case Is 'Fantastical'	Stinging from the Government's opening statement, a defiant Microsoft Corporation forcefully defended its chairman, William H. Gates, in Federal court today, asserting that the no-holds-barred tactics of his company are not only common in the computer industry but also good for the economy. Microsoft's opening salvo in the sweeping antitrust suit seemed to be devised as much for public opinion as for the court. The company faces weeks of being portrayed as a predator in a highly publicized trial, which could badly tarnish Microsoft's reputation even if it wins.
10/20/1998	What's Good for Microsoft . . .	Op-Ed article by Cypress Semiconductor president and chief executive T J Rodgers says Government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp will hurt consumers; says if company loses suit, every high-tech company will be fair target for Justice Department; says Silicon Valley executives who are siding with Government should be supporting Microsoft on basic principles (M)
10/20/1998	Antitrust Case Relies Heavily on Events at a 1995 Meeting	The Government's case against Microsoft is a narrative that revolves around the Netscape Communications Corporation and the Government's leading witness, James L. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old president and chief executive. In his 127 pages of written testimony, released this afternoon, Mr. Barksdale supplied new details and a first-hand perspective of a disputed meeting between Microsoft and Netscape on June 21, 1995, at Netscape's offices in Mountain View, Calif. At the meeting, the Government contends, Microsoft executives proposed that the two companies divvy up the emerging market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web. Microsoft replies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine business meeting.
10/20/1998	Odd Rules on Testimony, Strict Rules on Seating	The judge who is hearing the Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation without a jury has imposed unusual procedures that make this trial different from most civil lawsuits. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court, concerned that the trial not continue too long, has limited to 12 the number of witnesses each side is allowed to call, and much of the testimony had been taken before the trial began today.
10/20/1998	As Microsoft Trial Gets Started, Gates's Credibility Is Questioned	After months of noisy prelude, the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation opened in Federal court this morning with a pointed personal attack on the credibility and integrity of William H. Gates, the company's chairman. In a taped deposition, part of which the Government showed today in court, Mr. Gates said he knew little if anything about the main charges leveled against his company by the Justice Department and 20 states.
10/19/1998	Microsoft Goes to Court	Shortly before the Government filed its antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation in May, Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in change of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon Valley executive. The executive recalls telling Mr. Klein that unless a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer industry. Mr. Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's concerns. But he said time was running short and the strongest evidence in hand involved Microsoft's battle against the Netscape Communications Corporation in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating the Internet.
10/19/1998	What the Sherman Act Actually Says	Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, as passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which Federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times -- elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted of violating it. In the case of Microsoft, the Government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties. An Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade of commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.
10/19/1998	Push to Buy Palm Shows Aggression Is Consistent	In a recent move that indicated he has no intention of backing away from his company's aggressive business tactics, the Microsoft Corporation's chairman, William H. Gates, has proposed acquiring the software business behind the 3Com Corporation's popular Palm Pilot hand-held computer, according to people who have been briefed on the discussions. The offer, made in an August meeting with 3Com's chairman, Eric A. Benhamou, was not accepted by 3Com executives, those people say.
10/19/1998	Mr. Sherman's 1890 Nod to Populism Has Often Been Broadly Interpreted	The legal tool that the Government is using in its assault on the Microsoft Corporation -- the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 -- is brief, vague and malleable. The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts. Sponsored by Senator John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and small-business owners -- sizable voting groups -- resented the trusts as vehicles of concentrated power. But the trusts, large national holding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization and industrialization.
10/19/1998	Previous Antitrust Cases Leave Room for Both Sides to Cite Them Now	The case of United States v. Microsoft Corporation, the Government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments. Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin today in Federal District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines.
10/19/1998	More Enduring Than Politics	The Government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic Administrations and involved hundreds of Government lawyers and investigators. But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, by all accounts, of politics. Instead, like the software industry itself, the Government's pursuit of Microsoft has taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started in 1989.
10/18/1998	They Do Windows	The Microsoft File The Secret Case Against Bill Gates. By Wendy Goldman Rohm. Illustrated. 313 pp. New York: Times Business/ Random House. $25.95.
10/18/1998	CYBERSCOUT	VACATION PLANNING www.sidewalk.com I wanted to plan a three-day weekend, and I had heard that Microsoft's Sidewalk, which started in early 1997, was the place to begin on the Web. It was also the place I ended, exploring it on and off over a week. Designed mainly for residents of the cities it covers, Sidewalk does not offer airline information or on-line reservations, but it is a blessedly consistent site with an excellent search function, handsome despite its many advertisements. It's up and running for a dozen places: Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Melbourne, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Sydney, the Twin Cities and Washington. And by Thanksgiving, Microsoft says, it will add entertainment information, like movie reviews and concert listings, for ''every town in America,'' and Zagat restaurant reviews in a total of 40 areas. San Francisco, of which I am a native but which I haven't visited in years, was appealing. What follows are my choices; yours would certainly be different. There were 19 major categories for the City, as Northern Californians call it, from Find a Movie to Find a Place to Stay. Although the other cities offered similar information, it gratified my San Francisco chauvinism to note that Houston and Denver had only a dozen options each, and even New York had a mere 16. To find a place to stay, you can search for a specific place or pick a region -- in Sidewalks, San Francisco includes the East Bay, Napa Valley and other areas -- and a special option. I picked San Francisco and Historic Interest. That gave me 13 places, divided into bed-and-breakfasts, hotels and motels. The Fairmont and Mark Hopkins Intercontinental hotels, curiously, were listed as motels. My first choice was a luxury hotel, like the Fairmont, but a cooler head usually prevails, so I examined the bed-and-breakfasts. For the Red Victorian, in Haight-Ashbury, all the essential information was in the first listing, and a click away was a short article (''the rooms and decor reflect the Summer of Love''). Next, dinner the first night. A button produced the names, addresses and phone numbers of 22 restaurants near the B & B. An Asian place, the EOS Restaurant and Wine Bar, sounded promising. After spending most of a day flying, getting to and from airports and checking in, a restaurant a walk from the hotel is a fine idea. The next night we would wander farther afield. I selected Mexican/Southwestern cuisine, which San Francisco was noted for when I was growing up there; $15 to $20 per entree; three stars as a rating, and romantic as the option. There were no romantic, medium-priced, excellent Mexican restaurants. Maybe I was too choosy. I eased up on the conditions, and was rewarded with the names of 58 places. As with the hotels, you can click on the name of a restaurant in the brief list, and get a full page of information, including a review. For one Mexican place, the Cadillac Bar near the Moscone Center, it said ''if Tijuana is your idea of Mexico, the place has succeeded.'' Next, some things to do. In the Arts and Music section, I picked Poetry/Spoken Word and got the names of six events -- readings, live comedy and such -- for the next month and half. All of the Sidewalk subcategories operate the same way, so once you've found, say, a hotel, you have also learned how to search for a restaurant or an art gallery. To find another thing to do, I went into Places to Go and was given 14 major categories. I picked Culinary Shops/ Schools, and was presented with 85 places to shop for, eat or learn about food. It was an eclectic list, with Tante Marie's Cooking School, the Cellar at Macy's Union Square and to the 24th Street Cheese Company all on board. A walk in a park would help after eating too much. There were four romantic parks listed, headed by the Palace of Fine Arts, which I can attest is romantic, although Land's End was the Sidewalk choice. OTHER GUIDES There must be a couple of dozen other city guides on the Web. I dipped into several of them, but always returned to Sidewalk. You might, however, try Lycos City Guide, cityguide.lycos.com, which covers the world in a far more limited way, naturally, than Sidewalk covers metropolitan areas; CityInsights, www.cityinsights.com, which concentrates on San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Boston, but without much in any of them, or USA Citylink, www.usacitylink.com, with most of the cities you've ever heard of.

10/15/1998	AT&T Is Awarded Network Contract by Microsoft	The AT&T Corporation has won an 18-month contract from the Microsoft Corporation to provide a high-capacity network to link the software company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., to nearly 70 sites in the United States and Japan. Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, will use the network, known as asynchronous transfer mode, for electronic mail and data communications involving customer service and product development. Asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM, technology allows the transmission of data, voice and video in real time. Financial terms were not disclosed.
10/13/1998	Upcoming Book to Provide Grist at the Microsoft Trial	The Microsoft Corporation has said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week. But judging from an advance copy of the book's manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments as well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends that its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are a single integrated product. In its suit, the Government asserts that they are separate products that Microsoft bundled to get an unfair edge over a rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation, in the market for software used to browse the World Wide Web.
10/12/1998	Microsoft Memo Offers A Glimpse Of Gates 2.0	The Federal Government and the Microsoft Corporation may be nearing a historic antitrust showdown. But William H. Gates, the man who co-founded Microsoft, has largely disengaged himself from the company's legal defense to concentrate on new ways to extend the world's largest independent software company's influence into the next century. And instead of a corporation struggling to stay a step ahead of technological obsolesence -- the argument with which he has tended to rebut his anti-monopolist critics in recent years -- Mr. Gates boasts in a recent memo to his staff that Microsoft's position in the computer industry is stronger than it has ever been.
10/12/1998	Microsoft Is Busy on Several Legal Fronts	Microsoft's legal department could keep a travel agent fully occupied these days. In addition to dispatching lawyers from Redmond, Wash., to Federal court in Washington, D.C., the company is currently defending itself against lawsuits filed by software companies in San Jose, Calif., Salt Lake City and Bridgeport, Conn. Although Microsoft has said these three other suits are without merit, it has so far been notably unsuccessful in its efforts to have them dismissed or delayed -- or to have a change of venue to the presumably less burdensome and friendlier environs of Redmond. And the possibility exists that any evidence dug up in these corporate suits could reinforce the Government's case.
10/10/1998	The Cyber Donald	No trophy wives. No gaudy Rolexes, Julian Schnabel paintings or custom-made Armani suits. No Gordon Gekkos, Sherman McCoys, Donald Trumps. The 1990's model of high-flying self-made zillionaire, we've been repeatedly told, is as different from his 1980's predecessor as a fully loaded Jeep is from a Porsche. Instead of vulgar Reagan-era barbarians at the gate, we're getting dressed-down microgeeks who don't know or care how much money they have and are so busy dispensing utopia to the entire globe through technology that they don't have time to lord their good fortune over us peons who can't install a printer without crashing Windows. But as I stood in front of a glass cabinet at Draeger's in San Mateo, just south of San Francisco, recently, I wondered. Draeger's is the lush Silicon Valley supermarket where you can buy not only all the healthy foods you want but choose from a dizzying array of brandies and cigars to finish off that abstemious meal. In this locked cabinet were small bottles of balsamic vinegar that cost more than those vials of coke Wall Street traders were snorting in the 80's. Is it progress that our new rich can turn salad dressing into a status symbol?
10/10/1998	Microsoft Suit Pushed Back Until Oct. 19	A Federal judge today pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation by four days, to Oct. 19, while also ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argued that allowing ''an army of Government attorneys to come in and make demands will make it very difficult for us to remain in business.'' But after winning assurances from Government lawyers that they would make only narrow, targeted searches of the records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Microsoft to open the data base for perusal.
10/9/1998	Federal Judge Deals Microsoft A Setback on Antitrust Lawsuit	A Federal judge dealt the Microsoft Corporation a setback in its pretrial antitrust suit preparations yesterday by denying the company access to the interview tapes and transcripts for a new book written by two business school professors. To bolster its defense, Microsoft has sought the research materials for an unpublished book, ''Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,'' by Michael A. Cusumano, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School, and David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
10/8/1998	MICROSOFT'S WORLD: A special report.; How Software's Giant Played Hardball Game	In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon Valley. The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity for entrepreneurs to try to break the Microsoft Corporation's firm grip on the personal computer software business. Leading the challenge was the Netscape Communications Corporation, whose software for browsing the World Wide Web had ignited the Internet boom. James H. Clark, Netscape's chairman, spoke boldly of attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the movie ''Star Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and Netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance.
10/8/1998	Mac, Windows And Now, Linux	SINCE it was first developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki, the operating system called Linux has engendered strong -- some might say fanatical -- loyalty among a growing community of users. To be a Linux devotee today is a bit like being one of the early users of the Internet, when using it required a solid technical grounding. As it inches its way into the computing mainstream, Linux is beginning to enjoy more widespread acceptance. Last month, Intel and Netscape, along with venture capital firms, invested in Red Hat Software, a company that sells a packaged version of Linux together with applications. And rumors abound that Intel is planning investments in other Linux companies as well. Other well-established computer companies -- Oracle, Informix, Computer Associates, Corel Computer and I.B.M. -- have announced plans to make products available for Linux.
9/30/1998	Expert for Microsoft Helps Fight One of Its Subpoenas	The software industry is a notoriously fast, fluid business, with today's friend becoming tomorrow's foe. So too, it seems, for the industry's most famous defendant, the Microsoft Corporation, in its pretrial preparations. Microsoft recently selected Richard Schmalensee, a distinguished economist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as its expert witness to explain why the huge software company is a national asset and not a monopolistic predator. He will testify before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington, who will hear the antitrust case filed against Microsoft by the Government and 20 states.
9/28/1998	Compressed Data; Real Networks in Pact With America Online	It seemed a risky step when Rob Glaser, chairman of Real Networks Inc., appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July, joining a chorus of Microsoft bashers. He complained that some of the Microsoft Corporation's latest software refused to work properly with his company's so-called streaming programs, which deliver audio and video over the Internet. Mr. Glaser is no garden-variety Microsoft adversary. He is himself a former Microsoft executive, and Microsoft holds a 10 percent stake in his fast-growing Seattle company.
9/28/1998	For Sale: Free Software; Backers of Linux Say System Is Basis For Revolutionizing Computer Business	In an experiment that is half business model and half populist movement, a small company called Red Hat Software is charging $50 for an operating system called Linux that anyone can get free on the Internet, and it is paying programmers decent wages to write code that it will give away. While that might seem the most contrarian of business plans, Red Hat is attracting blue-chip investors to the notion that free can be profitable.
9/24/1998	NEWS WATCH; Even Smaller Notebooks Coming to Market	At least eight personal computer makers are planning to exhibit their new 'Jupiter-class' mini-notebook computers at annual Microsoft Professional Developer Conference on Oct 12; Jupiter is code name for windows CE 3.0, and is also generic term for new generation of portables that are smaller than conventional subnotebook computers but larger than palm-size computers (S)
9/24/1998	Covering the Territory; On the Web, Titans Battle for Turf	WHILE there are thousands of real estate sites on the Internet, a battle appears to be shaping up between two titans: Home Advisor, run by Microsoft, the mogul of cyberspace, and Realtor.com, which is operated by Real Select for the National Association of Realtors and is the leader in home listings on the Web. Microsoft opened Home Advisor in July. Prospective buyers can troll electronic neighborhoods for demographic data, calculate how much house they can afford using specific information about a house they like and even get pre-approved for a loan. A prospective buyer can specify the type of house sought and receive an E-mail message when one pops up.
9/21/1998	Compressed Data; Microsoft Word as Pundit: Software Maker Says It Isn't So	The Internet has been buzzing with all sorts of pranks and trivia related to President Clinton's troubles. But an E-mail tip that was widely circulated last week made the programmers of Microsoft Word, the word-processing software, seem predictive. The tip was this: Type the sentence, ''I'd like to see Bill Clinton resign'' in a Word document, highlight it, and then run it through the program's thesaurus (with the key combination Shift-F7 or by selecting Tools-Language-Thesaurus from the task-bar menu). The waggish thesaurus retorts with the phrase, ''I'll drink to that.''
9/17/1998	First Stop: The Tutorial	WINDOWS 98 TUTORIAL (Packaged with Windows 98.) WINDOWS 98 STARTS HERE (Microsoft Press; CD-ROM for Windows 98; $29.99.) TEACH YOURSELF WINDOWS 98 IN 24 HOURS By Greg Perry (Sams Publishing; $19.99.) GIVEN the system's Web focus, it is appropriate that many Web sites offer help with Windows 98. But novice and experienced users may be better served by staying off line, using books or CD-ROM tutorials to learn what they need.
9/17/1998	Happy Birthday, Your Team Won, Your Stock Crashed	WEEKDAY mornings for Jessica Nierenberg, a 23-year-old research manager at a market research company in San Francisco, usually begin with a dash to her neighborhood bus stop for a 30-minute ride to her office in the city's financial district downtown. By 8:30 she is at her desk, pouring herself a bowl of breakfast cereal and firing up her computer for a glimpse at what the planet has wrought while she slept. What greets her on her computer's screen is selected and displayed by My Yahoo, a free service by Yahoo, the giant Internet information company based in Santa Clara, Calif. My Yahoo shows Ms. Nierenberg how many E-mail messages she has waiting to be read and a sampling of news headlines -- she can decide to call up any of the articles on domestic, political and international news for a more detailed look. Weather forecasts for her area and for Boston, her hometown, are parked in a corner of the screen.
9/17/1998	Windows 98: After the Start Button	THREE years ago, David A. Karp, a Windows 95 beta tester, armed with a little spare time and his own Web site, started chronicling the things that bothered him in the new operating system. ''One of the first things I discovered about Windows 95 was that both its interface and architecture opened up a lot of power and flexibility,'' said Mr. Karp, the founder of Creative Element, a software consulting firm in San Francisco. ''At the same time, I found many of Microsoft's approaches in the new O.S. rather annoying and confusing, such as the decision to hide file extensions, the overuse of ''wizards'' and the attempt to make Windows more 'cute.'

9/17/1998	Computer Use at Home Looks a Lot Like Work	With rich audio, video and multimedia capabilities, the home computer is marketed as a veritable home entertainment center. But a new survey says it is used more often for banal tasks like word processing than for saving the galaxy in colorful video games or setting up elaborate databases to keep track of expenses. The survey, which looked for the 50 most popular software programs for home computers, found that the most popular ones were business-related applications. The three programs used most often were the Microsoft Office suite, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Notepad, according to the survey, which was done by Media Metrix and involved putting meters on 28,000 home computers to track usage.
9/17/1998	Universal Serial Bus Is Finally Picking Up Some Passengers	LOOK behind the back of that sleek new PC, and you'll find a rat's nest of cords, cables and wires. The mess is more than the computer's equivalent of a bad hair day -- it can make your PC darned hard to work with. Devices like your mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, printer and modem all plug into a bevy of connectors on the back of your PC. Unfortunately, many of those hard-to-reach connectors, or ports, are in short supply on the average machine. Try to attach both a laser printer and a color ink-jet printer to your home PC, and you will find yourself frozen out because most PC's have only one printer port.
9/16/1998	Intel Agreement Indicates a Rift With Microsoft	In an agreement to be announced on Wednesday, the Intel Corporation will license its advanced video compression software to Real Networks Inc., a Seattle-based developer of programs that deliver audio and video over the Internet. Beyond the expectation that Intel's technology will improve the performance of Real Network's software, the deal is seen as further evidence of growing cracks in the so-called Wintel duopoly, the cooperative relationship under which Intel's microprocessors and the Microsoft Corporation's operating systems have long dictated the direction of the personal computer industry.
9/15/1998	Microsoft's Trial Will Begin on Oct. 15	The trial in the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust fight with the Government will start Oct. 15, a Federal judge decided today. He also denied a request by the company to throw out the case. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court did agree to dismiss one claim of monopoly leveraging made by the 20 states that also sued the software giant.
9/14/1998	Novell, Once Foundering, Finds a Way to Coexist With Microsoft	At Novell Inc.'s headquarters in Provo, Utah, in a valley beneath the Wasatch Mountains, employees like to tease the chief scientist, Drew Major, for his habit of bringing a portable computer to meetings and writing software code while others drone on. The teasers notwithstanding, Mr. Major's habit is one that remains essential if Novell is to back away from the financial precipice, where until recently it has found itself isolated in an increasingly Microsoft-centric computing world.
9/14/1998	U.S. v. Microsoft: At Least They've Settled on Strategies	After nearly a year of testimony, acrimony and debate, the opposing parties in the antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation appear to have settled on strategies for the trial that begins in a few weeks. For Microsoft -- accused of bullying competitors, bribing allies and forcing customers to use the company's products, like them or not -- one general defense has come down to this: So what? Everyone does it. That is how business operates.
9/12/1998	Delay Is Expected in Start of Microsoft Case	Lawyers from the Microsoft Corporation and the Justice Department have tentatively agreed to push the date of the company's antitrust trial back to Oct. 15 from Sept. 23. The judge handling the case, Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court here, is considering ''a request from both parties'' for the trial to be postponed until Oct. 15, a Microsoft spokesman said today.
9/10/1998	Digital Employees Tell of Threats by Gates Over Product	Five current and former employees of the Digital Equipment Corporation say that their company was forced to drop a planned Internet product last year under threats from the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, William H. Gates. The allegations appear to support the Government's contention that Microsoft routinely suppresses competition in any new market that might threaten its monopoly in personal computer operating systems. The Digital Equipment employees said that the company disbanded a product development group based here after Mr. Gates told Robert Palmer, who was Digital's chief executive at the time, that a product the group was developing with a Microsoft rival, the Oracle Corporation, would threaten an earlier deal for Microsoft to develop a version of its industrial-strength Windows NT operating system for Digital's powerful new processor.
9/10/1998	Microsoft Serves Subpoenas On 5 Computer Companies	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had served subpoenas on five leading companies in the computer industry asking them to supply information that would show they engage in business practices similar to the practices at the heart of the Federal Government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. The subpoenas, which are so sweeping in scope that they could delay the scheduled Sept. 23 start of the trial, were served last Friday on the International Business Machines Corporation, the Netscape Communications Corporation, Novell Inc., the Oracle Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc.
9/9/1998	Sun and Microsystems Face Off at Hearing on '96 Java Pact	On the morning of March 12, 1996, after all-night negotiations to hammer out final details, principals from Sun Microsystems Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation signed a deal under which Sun licensed its promising Java technology to Microsoft. Today, the two companies, rivals again, squared off at the start of a three-day court hearing to determine just what that agreement meant.
9/9/1998	Microsoft Asks For Dismissal Of U.S. Suit	In a long, derisive court brief, the Microsoft Corporation asked a Federal judge today to dismiss the Government's antitrust suit, arguing that the Justice Department and 20 states were trying to ''distract the court from the fatal defects in their claims by slinging as much mud as they can.'' Microsoft was answering a Justice Department brief filed last week that detailed new evidence accusing Microsoft of trying to tyrannize several competing companies, including the Intel Corporation, Apple Computer Inc. and the Intuit Corporation, maker of the Quicken accounting software. The Microsoft trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 23.
9/7/1998	Witness Lists Suggest Moves By Microsoft And the U.S.	With the filing of witness lists on Friday night, the Government and the Microsoft Corporation offered the first glimpse of their courtroom strategies in the historic antitrust trial scheduled to begin later this month. The Government will portray Microsoft as an information-age monopolist with anticompetitive practices that are wide-ranging and that began long before anyone heard of the Internet. Microsoft plans to mount its defense by putting eight top executives on the stand, but with one conspicuous absence -- William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, who is not on the witness list.
9/4/1998	Mircosoft Ordered to Provide More Antitrust Evidence	A Federal judge ordered the Microsoft Corporation today to give the Justice Department reams of new evidence that Government lawyers say will bolster their antitrust case against the software giant. Microsoft's lawyers had argued that the new evidence, intended to demonstrate that the company pressured and bullied the Intel Corporation, Apple Computer and the Real Networks Corporation, should not be a part of the case since it was not specifically mentioned in the original lawsuits filed by the Justice Department and 20 states on May 18.
9/3/1998	Finding Something Nice to Say About Microsoft's Operations	Richard McKenzie and William Shughart don't believe that there should be the Microsoft logo under the word ''monopoly'' in the dictionary. The two economists, writing in the fall issue of Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy, contend that Microsoft's activities have not hindered software competition. In fact, they conclude that it is the Justice Department that is ''squelching competition.''
9/2/1998	U.S. Faults Depositions of Microsoft Executives	In a court document made public today, the Justice Department accused top executives of the the Microsoft Corporation, including its chairman, William H. Gates, of ''an astonishing lack of recall'' when they were questioned under oath for the Government's antitrust suit against the software giant. That assertion, plus several pieces of new evidence to support the Government's case, were submitted to Federal District Court here as part of the Justice Department's response to Microsoft's request that the case be dismissed.
8/31/1998	U.S. May Seek to Expand Evidence in Microsoft Case	The Government and 20 states suing the Microsoft Corporation are planning to ask a Federal judge to admit new evidence in their major antitrust case against the software maker, according to a person close to the investigation. The request could be made as early as today when the Justice Department and states are scheduled to reply to a Microsoft motion requesting that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson reject or pare back the case. The Seattle Times reported yesterday that the new accusations would be made today. But the person close to the investigation said that the Government and states had not yet reached final agreement on what fresh evidence to include, and that they would discuss the matter this morning.
8/31/1998	Signs Show 'Wintel' Axis Is Beginning To Wobble	Everywhere around Silicon Valley these days, there seem to be signs that the so-called Microsoft Windows and Intel chip alliance -- the so-called ''Wintel'' duopoly -- may be unraveling. For almost two decades, the fortunes of the Intel Corporation and of Microsoft have been inextricably bound, as the two companies have come to dominate the hardware and software hemispheres of the personal computer world.
8/26/1998	U.S. INVESTIGATING MICROSOFT'S ROLE IN INTEL DECISIONS	The two companies are so intertwined, so seemingly mutually dependent for their extraordinary success that the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation are often referred to as a single entity -- ''Wintel'' -- in recognition of the degree to which Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's microprocessors dominate the technology of personal computing. But the Government is investigating whether Microsoft has used its market muscle to force even Intel, its only real peer, to shelve new technology efforts that conflicted with Microsoft's ambitions.
8/25/1998	Microsoft Co-Founder to Sell More Shares	The co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, Paul G. Allen, filed to sell 700,000 common shares of the world's largest software maker for an expected $73.3 million. Mr. Allen, who is still on Microsoft's board though he is no longer a company executive, filed earlier this month to sell 7.9 million shares, valued at $834.3 million.
8/21/1998	Judge Delays Microsoft Trial 2 Weeks	A Federal judge today pushed back the starting date of the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust trial by two weeks, to Sept. 23, while company and Justice Department lawyers bickered over where and how pretrial questioning of William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, would take place. At the same time, a lawyer representing several news organizations, including The New York Times, requested an expedited review of an Appeals Court order on Wednesday that the deposition of Mr. Gates be taken behind closed doors. Wednesday's order stayed a ruling by the trial judge in the case that under Federal antitrust law, depositions had to be taken publicly.
8/20/1998	Microsoft Faces New Lawsuit, but Issues Seem the Same	The Microsoft Corporation has a fresh antitrust challenge on its hands from an unlikely source -- a small software supplier in Connecticut. Yet in broad terms, the suit filed late on Tuesday by Bristol Technology Inc. echoes the themes of the broad antitrust complaint against Microsoft, which was filed in May by the Federal Government and 20 states. Both cases contend that Microsoft has violated the Sherman Act by illegally seeking to protect and expand its dominance in the market for desktop software for personal computers.
8/20/1998	Court Will Let Gates Testify in Closed Session	A Federal appeals court today ordered that pretrial questioning of William H. Gates and 16 other Microsoft Corporation executives be taken behind closed doors, overruling a lower court judge who had ordered lawyers to take public depositions in the Government's antitrust case against the software giant. Although the order by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is temporary, pending a hearing in September, a ruling in the appeal will not be rendered until after the depositions have been taken.
8/15/1998	Corrections	The Market Place column on Monday, about an accounting convention that lets companies write off part of the price of acquisitions as a cost of continuing research, overstated the degree to which Microsoft has used it. The company did such accounting once -- last year, to write off $196 million of the $425 million it paid for WebTV. The column also misspelled the surname of an analyst for the Center for Financial Research and Analysis who has criticized such accounting, and misstated the location of the center. He is Brad Rexroad, not Rexford; the center is in Rockville, Md., not Bethesda.
8/13/1998	E-Mail Flaws Make Usually Confident Users Feel Uneasy	COMPUTER security has long been the sole province of a grizzled clan of experts who have despaired of getting the public to take the subject seriously. Skeptics have dismissed warnings of hacker attacks as alarmist, cynics have figured that attacks were inevitable, and victims have often preferred to not talk about it. Casual computer users have just assumed that the most likely targets -- big businesses and the Pentagon -- could take care of themselves. But the recent news that simply opening an E-mail message could nuke your hard drive has created a new concern about personal software security among average E-mail users. One flaw in some of the most popular E-mail programs, Microsoft's Express and Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail, became public last month. Last week, a separate problem was discovered in Qualcomm's Eudora, the most widely used E-mail program.
8/13/1998	Different Way to Look At the Browser Wars	The conventional wisdom says Netscape is the rabbit and Microsoft is the tortoise in the race to create the dominant browser, albeit a large, extremely powerful tortoise that is gaining rapidly. But a new survey puts the browser race into a different light. Positive Support Review, a Web design and consulting company in Los Angeles, has found that, by one measure anyway, Microsoft Internet Explorer has a greater share of the browser market and that Netscape's Navigator browser is now the one playing catch up. Positive Support Review's atypical conclusion is based on measuring market share in a different way: instead of looking at the absolute number of people who use a given browser, looking at how much time they spend using the respective browsers.
8/13/1998	Braindump on the Blue Badge: A Guide to Microspeak	DETROIT and Hollywood have invented scores of words and phrases that have become part of America's speech and psyche. Tail fin, mini-series and sitcom quickly come to mind. Now that role falls to Microsoft. The company that has shaped the way hundreds of millions of people use computers is helping to shape the way people talk as well, with words like facemail and self-toast and new meanings for terms like dog food and ask.
8/13/1998	Microsoft Appeals Judge's Order Opening Depositions to the Public	The Microsoft Corporation appealed a Federal judge's order that pretrial questioning of its chairman, William H. Gates, and 16 employees in the Government's antitrust action be opened to the public and the news media, the company said today. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court refused today to postpone the order he issued on Tuesday that the depositions of Mr. Gates and others take place soon so that the Sept. 8 trial date he has set is not delayed. The appeal will be heard within the next week.
8/12/1998	Judge Rules Gates Must Give Deposition in Public	A Federal judge ordered yesterday that the Government's pretrial questioning of William H. Gates and other executives of the Microsoft Corporation must be opened up to news organizations. The court ruling giving the press and the public access to depositions in a major antitrust case is somewhat unusual, but it is not unprecedented. One similar instance came during the Justice Department's 13-year pursuit of I.B.M., a case that the Government dropped in 1982.
8/11/1998	More Jockeying To Pare Back Microsoft Suit	The Microsoft Corporation asked a Federal court yesterday to narrow or toss out the Government's suit against the company -- the latest effort to derail the landmark antitrust case before the trial begins next month. Microsoft's request for summary judgment, legal experts say, can be seen as a routine step in a major antitrust case -- a request to dismiss the suit that the judge is unlikely to grant, they note. But the company's 88-page motion, they add, does indicate how much confidence the Microsoft legal team has gained from a Federal appeals court ruling in June in an earlier, narrower case.
8/11/1998	Fix for Some E-Mail Security Problems Is Reported	The leading provider of software that routes electronic mail through the Internet plans to announce on Tuesday that it has developed a simple and free fix for a security vulnerability discovered in three E-mail programs made by the Microsoft Corporation and the Netscape Communications Corporation. The vulnerability, found in late June in Microsoft's Outlook Express and Outlook 98 and in Netscape Mail, enables an attacker to send an E-mail message containing a malicious program that could damage or steal data.
8/10/1998	Compressed Data; Microsoft Pitching Tent In Silicon Valley	teven A. Ballmer, who has more often cast a dark shadow over Silicon Valley, came to the valley last week offering peace, love and local tax payments. Mr. Ballmer, newly elevated to the position of president of the Microsoft Corporation, announced that his company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., would set up a satellite headquarters in a 32-acre corporate campus in Mountain View, Calif. Mr. Ballmer is renowned for being the field marshal of Microsoft's aggressive and highly effective marketing efforts, which have often left Silicon Valley littered with casualties. And not lost on anyone is the fact that Microsoft is moving into the hometown of the Netscape Communications Corporation, whose David-and-Goliath struggle with Microsoft is at the heart of the Government's antitrust suit against Mr. Ballmer's company.
8/7/1998	U.S. Judge Orders Microsoft to Turn Over Operating System Code	Over strong objections from the Microsoft Corporation, a Federal judge ordered the company today to turn over to the Government the source code for its operating system and make its chairman, William H. Gates, and 16 other executives available for pretrial depositions that last as long the Justice Department deems necessary. Microsoft was ordered to give Justice Department lawyers preparing for a Sept. 8 trial in the Government's antitrust suit a copy of the source code for the latest two versions of its operating system, Windows 95 and Windows 98.
8/4/1998	Software Makers Offer To Help . . . Themselves	With great fanfare, 23 software makers last week issued a policy statement titled ''Ask, Tell & Help,'' promising to end a problem that has frequently infuriated Windows 95 users -- programs that automatically install themselves as ''default applications,'' the software the operating system calls upon to open all files of a certain type. A closer examination of the policy suggests that it might be less a sincere effort by the developers -- including Netscape Communications, Novell, Real Networks and Sun Microsystems -- to restrain their own practices than an attempt to restrain Microsoft from absorbing their products into the operating system.
8/3/1998	The Internet, whose reason for being lies in open standards, is snagging on free-market appetites.	WHEN does the term ''commercial Internet'' become an oxymoron? Perhaps it is when powerful corporations use their market strength to impose technical standards -- intended to further their own interests and improve their bottom lines -- at the expense of universal access to on-line goods and services. The browser war between Microsoft and the Netscape Communications Corporation already threatens a truly global marketplace that is fully accessible with any browser on any computer platform. And this threat is growing with the continuing push toward unilateral standards that will dictate how consumers will one day interact, for example, with on-line video programming or World Wide Web pages.
8/1/1998	Thomson Multimedia Finds Friends With Deep Pockets	For years, Thomson Multimedia was known mostly for two things: color television sets and losses. With Microsoft and the DirecTV unit of Hughes Electronics, which is part of General Motors; NEC of Japan, and Alcatel S.A. of France lining up to buy shares in Thomson, the French Government is betting this will end.
8/1/1998	Microsoft and U.S. at Odds Over Testimony	In a pretrial motion, the Government accused the Microsoft Corporation yesterday of resisting requests to make some of its senior executives available for depositions and to hand over technical information. The Justice Department wants more time than Microsoft is offering to question William H. Gates, the company's chairman. Another point of conflict between the two sides is the terms under which Microsoft hands the Government the confidential software code for its Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems.
7/31/1998	France to Sell Up to 30% Of Thomson Multimedia	The French Government agreed today to sell as much as 30 percent of Thomson Multimedia, one of Europe's largest consumer electronics makers, to industrial partners including the Microsoft Corporation, which is expected to use the investment to expand its push into delivering Internet services via television. The Government said that Microsoft and the DirecTV unit of the Hughes Electronics Corporation, which is part of General Motors, along with the NEC Corporation of Japan and Alcatel S.A. of France, would each be allowed to buy 7.5 percent of the state-owned Thomson Multimedia, which has been losing money for years. The financial terms of the sale were not disclosed.
7/30/1998	Fixes Are Elusive For a Security Gap	A serious security flaw in recent versions of Microsoft Outlook 98, Outlook Express and Netscape Mail -- three of the four most widely used Internet electronic mail programs -- is proving more difficult to fix than initially thought. Programmers at Microsoft and Netscape were scrambling last night to devise solutions to the flaw, which could allow rogue programmers to damage or steal data from a user's computer by sending a seemingly normal E-mail message. After posting a software patch on its Web site Tuesday, Microsoft programmers discovered that the proposed solution did not fully fix the problem, leaving users vulnerable. ''The problem is deeper and more complicated than was reported,'' a Microsoft spokeswoman said. ''We hope to have a fix by the end of the week.''
7/30/1998	African-American Encyclopedia Has Rich Roots	HENRY LOUIS GATES JR., an academic all-star, chairman of Harvard University's African-American studies department and a staff writer for The New Yorker, is rarely short of ideas. But the inspiration for his current big project -- a comprehensive reference work on Africa and people of African descent -- goes back nearly a century, to W.E.B. Du Bois, who first advanced the notion of an ''Encyclopedia Africana'' in 1909. Du Bois saw the project as an act of progressive scholarship. ''He believed that you could help defeat racism if you could codify the knowledge of the black experience, undermining all sorts of stupid myths and prejudices,'' Mr. Gates said.
7/30/1998	Flaw in E-Mail Programs Points to an Industrywide Problem	The security flaw reported this week in E-mail programs produced by two highly respected software companies points to an industrywide problem -- the danger of programming languages whose greatest strength is also their greatest weakness. Much of the power and flexibility of C and C++, the computer languages most commonly used to build commercial software, derive from the fact that they give professional programmers the ability to write enormously complex programs quickly and efficiently. But they do this, in part, by allowing short cuts that can also lead to disaster.
7/29/1998	Software Flaw Lets Computer Viruses Arrive Via E-Mail	A serious security flaw has been discovered in popular E-mail programs published by the Microsoft Corporation and the Netscape Communications Corporation that would permit a malicious person to send a message containing a virus that could crash a computer and destroy or even steal data. So far, security tests have shown that the flaw exists in three of the four most popular E-mail programs, used by perhaps tens of millions of people around the world: Microsoft's Outlook Express and Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail, part of Netscape's Communicator suite of Internet programs.
7/29/1998	Microsoft Files Its Denials in Antitrust Suit	In the first court papers it has filed in its defense, the Microsoft Corporation called the Government's sweeping antitrust case against it ''completely groundless'' and offered a glimpse of the legal strategy it will pursue. Microsoft's formal answer to the suit filed by the Justice Department and 20 states in May is an early step in the legal moves that will precede a trial in Federal District Court in Washington, scheduled to begin on Sept. 8. Other, more detailed, court filings will be made later. Both sides are scrambling to take depositions from potential witnesses.
7/26/1998	The Nation: Living Large; Forget Microsoft. G.M. Is Still the Biggest Kid on the Block.	TO appreciate the size of General Motors, consider this: If the Microsoft Corporation were a G.M. auto parts division, William H. Gates would be just another G.M. vice president that nobody has ever heard of. A quarter-century of shrinking market share and periodic financial crises at G.M. have fed a popular image of the auto maker as a shadow of its former self. Yet G.M. remains the world's largest company in sales and share of global economic output, and is immense by any standard. Growth in the entire American economy has been slowed substantially by eight-week-old strikes here that have paralyzed the auto maker's North American operations.
7/25/1998	Battling Microsoft Takes Toll on Stock	Testifying against the Microsoft Corporation can be costly. For Real Networks Inc., the price seems to have been about $240 million, or 25 percent of its stock market value, in two days. On Wednesday, the day before the chairman of Real Networks appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, shares of the company closed at $44.25. Yesterday, they closed at $33.25, down about 25 percent in two days.
7/24/1998	Ally or Foe? A Complaint On Microsoft	The chairman of a young, fast-growing software company testified at a Senate hearing today that the Microsoft Corporation had introduced a competing product that crippled his company's most recent technology. Competitors commonly complain that Microsoft business practices are unfair. But this complaint appears particularly intriguing because it comes from a company with close ties to Microsoft -- and one that is engaged in a promising niche of the Internet software market in which the Government is investigating Microsoft tactics.
7/24/1998	Microsoft Describes a Successful Year and Talks of More	Confident Microsoft executives today outlined for industry analysts a string of successes suggesting momentum throughout the computer industry in markets as diverse as home computers, business desktop machines, engineering work stations and the giant computers that connect entire corporations and serve up World Wide Web sites on the Internet. To maintain this momentum, the company said it planned to increase research and development spending to $3 billion a year from $2.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, and to pump almost $200 million a year more into technical and customer support.
7/23/1998	Windows 98? Just One Little Thing . . .	THE only reason I considered installing Windows 98 was because my friend Kip Crosby promised that the upgrade would cure the crashes that plagued my computer. I figured he should know, considering that he had recently co-written ''The Windows 98 Bible.'' ''How I wish we lived in a world where people like you weren't afraid the computer would blow up every time you did something to it,'' Mr. Crosby lectured me. ''Your problem is that Windows 95 and Internet Explorer 4.0 are having severe disagreements. But if you upgrade, the browser will know the operating system is the boss.''
7/23/1998	Who Said Computers Have to Be Square?	APPLE was certainly ''thinking different'' when it created the iMac. The new personal computer, which goes on sale on Aug. 15, has already won popular acclaim for its creative design and its refreshing departure from the computer industry standard of boring beige boxes. By rushing the iMac to market, Apple succeeded in getting on the radar screens of buyers before the next school year starts. There is a pent-up demand among owners of older Macintoshes for an affordable upgrade, and Apple is expected to sell all the iMacs it can make in coming months.
7/23/1998	Prodigy Opens On-Line Classes To Teach Software Programs	Prodigy Internet has established an on-line learning center, offering training classes for popular applications from Microsoft, Adobe, Lotus and others. Prodigy said the classes could reduce the time and costs associated with training by using the Internet as a delivery mechanism and using animation and real-time audio technology. The company has developed a synchronized multimedia file format to deal with the choppiness and poor quality found in most Internet multimedia files.
7/22/1998	Microsoft's Chief Salesman Named Second in Command	Steven A. Ballmer, the combative chief salesman of the Microsoft Corporation, was named the company's president yesterday. The promotion is a formal acknowledgment of what has long been an accepted fact within the company -- that Mr. Ballmer is Microsoft's second in command and that he is the natural successor to William H. Gates, the 42-year-old chairman.
7/21/1998	Microsoft Yields to Korean Software Rival	Microsoft has scrapped an attempt to eliminate a big South Korean rival in the $14 million market for Korean-language word-processing software because of public opposition. Microsoft had offered to buy 20 percent of the South Korean rival -- named Hangul, after the Korean-language script system -- but said it would make the $20 million investment only if the company, which needed cash, withdrew its software from the market. In response, a group of 13,000 South Korean computer users offered to invest about $7.8 million in the company to keep its Korean-language software in use.
7/20/1998	Compressed Data; Microsoft's Apple Stake Is Hardly Altruism	When the Microsoft Corporation invested $150 million in Apple Computer last August, the action was viewed as a kind of self-interested donation. In the bargain, Apple agreed to drop a lingering patent suit against Microsoft and also agreed to use Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the standard browser on its Macintosh machines. With Apple then in dire financial straits, Steven P. Jobs, the company's co-founder and acting chief, said the appropriate response from the Apple faithful was to ''treat Microsoft with a little gratitude.''
7/20/1998	Compressed Data; A Microsoft Innovator To Venture Farther Out	Peter Neupert, the Microsoft executive responsible for some of the company's most innovative, and risky, new media deals, has picked a new career with at least as much risk: venture-capital investing. Starting next month, the 11-year Microsoft veteran will join Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Silicon Valley investment force behind At Home, Amazon.com and Excite, among others.
7/20/1998	20 States Withdraw A Microsoft Count	Twenty states suing the Microsoft Corporation for antitrust violations have dropped an allegation that the software giant gives computer makers illegal financial incentives to install its Windows Office software instead of competing business applications. Analysts said a new filing signaled a partial retreat by the states and an attempt to rewrite the complaint to respond to a June 23 court ruling that Microsoft was not illegally tying its Windows 95 operating system with its Internet Explorer browser. A similar tying allegation about Windows 98 is the centerpiece of both state and United States Justice Department lawsuits filed on May 18.
7/20/1998	Debate Grows Over the Role An Operating System Plays	Ask 10 computer scientists to state which features define an operating system, and you will probably get 10 different answers. Ask what those features will be four years from now, and the responses will range from some vague variation on the status quo to visions of vast, potent networks that empower individual computers with a sort of communal energy. Asking such questions is not an academic exercise. The nature of the operating system, the master program that breathes life into computer hardware, is at the heart of the Justice Department's lawsuit accusing the Microsoft Corporation of antitrust violations. And yet, just last week, Sun Microsystems Inc. announced a product called Jini that is designed to negate the need for Microsoft's Windows and other operating systems used today.
7/19/1998	VOICES: VIEWPOINT; An Open Internet Helps Business, Too	Article by Sendmail Inc co-founder Greg Olson holds Microsoft, embroiled in controversy over its Windows operationg system, poses even greater threat in its practice of developing proprietary, vendor-controlled software and its encrouchment on Internet (M)
7/19/1998	Fast Forward; Control Freaks	A little window into bill gates's soul opened the day the Microsoft antitrust negotiations broke down for good. The light came from a plaintive comment by an anonymous Microsoft executive, who was trying to explain why it would just be so unfair if the Government were to let computer makers substitute their own start-up screens for the Windows ''desktop'' -- especially screens that gave users an alternative way to run their software. ''That would be tantamount to undermining our franchise,'' the executive told Steve Lohr of The Times, ''by making Windows some bit of software plumbing that no one sees.''
7/17/1998	Microsoft Logs Gain of 28% In Earnings	Showing practically no financial pain from its antitrust battles, the Microsoft Corporation reported a 28 percent gain today in its fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings, modestly exceeding Wall Street expectations. Microsoft also said it had already sold more than one million copies of its new operating system software, Windows 98, to consumers. The company began to sell the new software only last month.
7/16/1998	Jump-Start From Windows 98 For the Universal Serial Bus	The Universal Serial Bus has finally pulled into the station, pushed along by the release of Windows 98. The U.S.B. solves a significant problem for users of DOS and Windows machines, which used interrupt request lines, or IRQ's, so various parts of the computer could get the attention of the processor and operating system.
7/16/1998	Upgrading to Windows 98? Upgrade Your Vocabulary, Too	DEPENDING on whom you ask, Windows 98 is either the easiest and most stable operating system upgrade yet for personal computers or an exasperating experience that plunges many users into the technical swamps where they have to deal with unfamiliar things like device drivers, BIOS upgrades, clean installs, registry corruption and software incompatibilities. In other words, it's business as usual for an operating system upgrade, except that this one is so popular that calls are overwhelming Microsoft's support lines. In fact, Microsoft did not expect the sales of Windows 98 to be as healthy as they have been. Independent market researchers say more than a half-million copies of the $90 upgrade package were sold in the first few days after its release on June 25, easily making it the most popular software product of the year.
7/13/1998	Compressed Data; Trying to Interpret An Error Message	Conspiracy or bad choice of words? An Internet service provider in Vancouver, British Columbia, says an error message in Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 is advising his customers to take their business elsewhere. The message appears in a dialogue box that pops up when something goes wrong. It says, ''You might want to try selecting 'other Internet provider' from the list of Internet service providers.'' The error message affects only certain Explorer users who have built Web pages with Microsoft's Front Page Express.
7/9/1998	That Strange Keyboard Isn't Broken, Just Redesigned	PEOPLE who experience wrist or forearm pain from using computers often welcome the idea of so-called ergonomic keyboards, which are supposed to reduce the risk of injury and increase comfort. But do they really help prevent repetitive stress injury, known as R.S.I.? And if so, which ones are best? With the widespread use of personal computers, the incidence of repetitive stress injuries has greatly increased, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration calls R.S.I. one of the fastest-growing workplace injuries. R.S.I. is an umbrella term for many injuries caused by overuse of the nerves, muscles and tendons; the ailments include carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and trigger finger, to name a few.
7/6/1998	Compressed Data; A Line of Computers Without Windows	As a market test, Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology recently tried to order a personal computer from a dozen companies without Microsoft's Windows as the operating system. No luck, reported David Chun, the Nader summer intern who made the calls to Dell Computer, Gateway, I.B.M. and others -- not even when he asked for a PC with no operating system at all. He should have called VA Research in Mountain View, Calif. The upstart computer maker specializes in machines that run Linux, a freeware version of the Unix operating system. Linux (pronounced (LINN-uks) originated in 1991, written by a young Finnish programmer, Linus Torvalds.
7/6/1998	When Does Merger Become Monopoly?	To the Editor: The recent decision by a Federal appeals court allowing Microsoft to integrate Internet capability into its Windows operating system is far from ''deeply flawed'' (editorial, June 25). Nor is the decision a misapplication of a Harvard law professor's novel antitrust test (Op-Ed, June 29).
7/6/1998	Technology Finance Plan Is Scuttled By University	The California State University, the nation's largest college system, has scuttled a much-disputed plan to accept a $300 million investment from a group of high-technology companies to upgrade the university's networks and other technology infrastructure. The proposal, known as CETI, for California Educational Technology Initiative, was officially canceled last week when GTE, the lead company in the proposed partnership, announced that it would not participate because it could not reach agreement with the university on the financial terms of the deal.
7/6/1998	When Does Merger Become Monopoly?	To the Editor: According to Einer Elhauge (Op-Ed, June 29), if Microsoft were required to manufacture the software code for Windows and its Internet browser on separate disks, computer users -- rather than Microsoft -- could themselves create the ''integrated product.''
7/5/1998	Ideas & Trends; Microsoft Has Seen the Enemy . . .	A MONOPOLIST is big and bad. He has the muscle to dictate prices and bully competitors and consumers, both of whom are powerless to resist the monopolist's will. Enter the Microsoft Corporation, accused by the Government of being a monopolist, and its new computer operating system, Windows 98, which will play a starring role in the monopoly case that the Justice Department will present to a Federal judge in September. Windows 98 went on sale 10 days ago and, according to PC Data, a market research firm, the early results are quite respectable -- about the same as the first days of sales for its predecessor, Windows 95. Still, since there are now about 300 million machines running earlier versions of Windows -- more than twice the number when Windows 95 was introduced -- the early sales are not a runaway success.
7/2/1998	Unilever Developing On-Line Programs	Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products giant, said yesterday that it had signed agreements with America Online Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation to develop interactive marketing and new media programs for brands including Lipton tea, Ragu spaghetti sauce and Dove soap. Though terms were not disclosed, the Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age said the spending was considerably more than $20 million over three years, a significant on-line advertising budget for a packaged-goods marketer.
7/2/1998	Living With Windows 98	To the Editor: ''Windows 98: $90 Worth Of Duct Tape'' tells the truth about the new release: there is nothing compelling about it. Except that it includes Apple's Quick Time 3.0 technology.
7/2/1998	Living With Windows 98	To the Editor: After having used various prerelease copies of Windows 98, I'd have to say that most of your article about it (''Windows 98: $90 Worth of Duct Tape,'' June 25) is right on the money. However, I'd like to point out that the new Internet integration that Microsoft has claimed is ''inseparable'' from the operating system is actually easy to disable. The easiest way is to go to www.annoyances.org/win98/ features/integration.html and use the utility that does it for you. DAVID A. KARP Oakland, Calif., June 25, 1998
7/2/1998	Flaw in Word 98 Can Spread Your Personal Information	It's a paranoid computer user's worst nightmare: private information from your hard disk made accessible for the reading enjoyment of strangers. And it could happen if you use Microsoft Word 98 for Macintosh. As reported last week on the Mac in Touch Web page (www.macintouch.com), hidden chunks of old E-mail, disk-directory paths, Web addresses and other confidential information from a user's hard drive or RAM can be embedded in Microsoft Word 98 documents. The unintended information can be made visible when the documents are opened with a text-editing program like BBEdit, thus making E-mail or network files a potential security risk.
7/1/1998	Differences Over Privacy On the Internet	Differences between European nations and the United States over how to protect consumer privacy have led to a clash over technologies endorsed by the world's two leading makers of browsing software for navigating the World Wide Web, the Microsoft Corporation and the Netscape Communications Corporation. The differences between Europe governments, which favor enacting laws to protect consumer privacy on line, and the Clinton Administration, which prefers to let electronic commerce industries regulate themselves, could delay the much-anticipated evolution of the Internet into a huge international supermarket of goods and services.
7/1/1998	Microsoft's Windows 98 Sells Much Better Than Expected	Windows 98 went on sale last week with little fanfare and supported by a puny marketing budget compared with the spending for its relentlessly promoted predecessor, Windows 95. And Windows 98 also came to market under a legal cloud, as Exhibit A in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation. No matter, it seems, at least not in the first few days. Windows 98 flew off store shelves just as quickly as did Windows 95 when it went on sale, even slightly faster, according to PC Data, a market research firm.
6/30/1998	Prosecutors Say Microsoft Case Will Be Honed	State and Federal prosecutors insist that while last week's Federal appeals court ruling favoring the Microsoft Corporation might force them to alter their legal tactics, it also offers a road map to help sharpen their new antitrust case against the software giant. After several days of intense discussion of the appeals court ruling, Justice Department prosecutors and state Attorneys General are even more determined to press their case, several of them said in interviews.
6/29/1998	Microsoft Gets an Undeserved Break	Op-Ed article by Harvard Law School Prof Einer Elhauge says Federal appeals court decision upholding right of Microsoft to sell Internet browser together as integrated product was wrong; says judges misread antitrust standard regarding what constitutes one product (M)
6/29/1998	Intel's Antitrust Alternative: Avoid Public Confrontation	As the Justice Department was readying its antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation this spring, the company hired a dozen powerful lobbyists, choreographed rallies and news conferences and issued sharp denunciations of the Government. In short, it waged the technology industry's equivalent of a holy war. By contrast, when the Federal Trade Commission was preparing its antitrust suit against the Intel Corporation this month, the company offered a simple, polite statement: ''We are cooperating with the Government and will continue to cooperate. They are just doing their job, and we respect their right to do so.''
6/28/1998	Software May Go, Microsoft Won't	To the Editor: Re ''Microsoft Marches On'' (Op-Ed, June 25): If in the future the operating system and the applications become indistinguishable, as Douglas Rushkoff suggests, people who want to use applications other than those supplied by Microsoft will have to superimpose them on a bloated, megabyte-consuming program, and perhaps encounter problems doing so. Besides, there are often better programs than the ones Microsoft includes, like backup programs and defragmenters.
6/28/1998	Software May Go, Microsoft Won't	To the Editor: Your June 25 editorial ''A Mistaken Microsoft Ruling'' misses a major point. The statement that ''Microsoft is in a position to give such a big advantage to its own software that any other software maker would not be able to compete'' is on target. But browser integration may well be more about services than software.
6/28/1998	Software May Go, Microsoft Won't	To the Editor: Douglas Rushkoff (Op-Ed, June 25) just adds to the confusion regarding the Microsoft suit. He asks, ''What happens when there is no such thing as software?'', then describes a world in which one program is launched from another, rather than being run as a separate utility. Sorry, but there is always going to be software in the classical sense. There are thousands of special-purpose programs needed by specific professions and hobbyists.
6/28/1998	High-Profile Suits Shine Spotlight on State Attorneys General	The job of state attorney general has sometimes been ridiculed as attracting ambitious officeholders and then stranding them in political oblivion. According to one old political maxim, ''A.G.'' stands not for attorney general, but for aspiring governor. But over the last couple of years, a new activism by the chief legal officers in many states has made their job more consequential. It began with the state lawsuits against tobacco companies, which accelerated the national battle over smoking. It expanded when 20 states, including New York and Connecticut, joined the Justice Department in filing antitrust charges against Microsoft in May.
6/25/1998	Microsoft Marches On	Douglas Rushkoff Op-Ed article says Justice Department's effort to prevent Microsoft Corp from blundling its Web browsing software with its Windows operating system is a phantom battle because Microsoft's goal is to integrate all software into its operating system, not just Internet browsing, word processing and spreadsheet but also cable television, palmtop devices and anything else that can be run on a Windows platform; says Government would be better advised to demand promotion of public interest from Microsoft and others architects of our information infrastructure, such as online libraries, educational provisions or open coding standards (M)
6/25/1998	Huge Microsoft Photo File Is Part of a Bigger Picture	NEED an aerial picture of your house or your business or even the Great Wall of China? There's no need to ask the Government for a satellite photo; just get on the Web and ask the Microsoft Corporation, which unveiled an on-line database this week granting access to satellite and aerial pictures of nearly half of the United States and some foreign sites. While Microsoft says that its database (www.terraserver.microsoft. com), called Terra Server, is the largest database available on line, there appears to be some dispute about that. In any case, the project not only marks the creation of one whopper of a digital scrapbook, it also says something very big about Microsoft's effort to enter the database business, using as an opener a venture that can capture the public imagination. Microsoft's strategy is to use Terra Server to prove that its software and operating system are suited to massive databases.
6/25/1998	A Mistaken Microsoft Ruling	One month after the Justice Department filed its sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft, a Federal appeals court has issued a deeply flawed ruling that may weaken the Government's case. The three-judge panel seemed to adopt Microsoft's arrogant claim that it has the right to incorporate its browser, or any other software, into its Windows operating system as long as doing so offers certain advantages to consumers. But if the thinking behind this decision prevails, it could permit Microsoft to use its monopoly power to crush competitors throughout the Internet. The Justice Department thus needs to mount a vigorous counterattack invoking the full force of antitrust laws. The Justice Department can argue that the appeals court ruling need not determine the outcome of its larger antitrust case against Microsoft. That is because it was based on a narrow case brought by the Justice Department last year, when it charged that Microsoft violated a 1995 consent decree affecting the marketing of Windows 95. In that decree, Microsoft agreed not to condition its sale of Windows to computer makers on the sale of other software, but could improve Windows by integrating other functions into it.
6/25/1998	A Mobile-Phone Software Venture	Psion P.L.C., a British palmtop computer company, is joining with Nokia of Finland, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola -- which together make 70 percent of the world's mobile phones -- to develop software for mobile phones that behave more like computers. The venture, called Symbian, is intended to surpass Microsoft Inc.'s Windows CE, now used in many palmtop computers, to become the standard operating software for mobile communication devices. Psion estimates the market could be worth $900 million by 2002.
6/25/1998	Microsoft Alternatives	To the Editor: The suit by the Justice Department and the state Attorneys General against the Microsoft Corporation doesn't go nearly far enough. The answer to increased competition is not just to unbundle the Web browser, it is to require the consumer to purchase any new computer with no software preloaded, just as was done in the MS/PC DOS days, when the user could choose I.B.M.'s or Microsoft's operating system. Microsoft has a tremendous advantage over its competitors by offering computer manufacturers software bundles along with the Windows operating system. The only chance of real competition is for preloaded software to be eliminated. RAYMOND W. TOWNSEND New York, June 19, 1998
6/25/1998	Ruling on Microsoft Shows a Fault Line In Antitrust Theory	To the Microsoft Corporation, a Federal appeals court ruling in the company's favor on Tuesday was a gratifying triumph of sweeping importance for its long-running antitrust battle with the Government. To the Justice Department and 20 states pitted against Microsoft, it was merely a bump in the road as they head to court again in September with a broader antitrust case against the leading computer software company. Yet antitrust experts said yesterday that the split decision by the three-judge panel -- a majority opinion written by a conservative and a partial dissent by a liberal -- was both a big victory for Microsoft and a reflection of the wider debate over how antitrust doctrine should apply to high-technology industries.
6/25/1998	Windows 98: $90 Worth Of Duct Tape	WHAT a difference three years make! When Windows 95 finally made its way out the door, the Microsoft Corporation promoted it to the cheeky beat of the Rolling Stones' ''Start Me Up.'' The CD-ROM came with hip videos of Edie Brickell and Weezer. Windows 98? Dullsville. Today's official release flaunts the bland slogan, ''Works Better, Plays Better.'' The CD? It comes with a Microsoft commercial appropriately set to a pop adaptation of a theme from Beethoven's Piano Sonata (Op. 13), the ''Pathetique.''
6/25/1998	Microsoft Alternatives	To the Editor: The letter on June 18 responding to ''Nader Weighs In on Microsoft, Calling for the Return of OS/2'' (June 11) did not indicate that Linux is the fastest growing operating system. As a programmer with 41 years of experience, I can tell you that program development with Linux is incomparably superior to anything Microsoft has ever done, or ever will do.
6/24/1998	Ruling Unlikely to Affect Windows 98 Release	For all the dust kicked up in the legal battle over the Microsoft Corporation's right to include Web browsing software in its Windows 95 operating system, a ruling by an appeals court today in the software giant's favor will have almost no impact on the imminent release of Windows 98, a new version that integrates the browser even more tightly. What the ruling and the suit have managed to do is focus a lot of public attention on a product that has been playing to widespread yawns in computer industry publications. In recent weeks, even Microsoft has been playing down revenue expectations for Windows 98, which is scheduled to go on sale at retail outlets on Thursday.
6/24/1998	MICROSOFT WINNER IN APPEAL TO KEEP SOFTWARE INTACT	In an opinion that undercut a central argument in the Government's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation, a Federal appeals court today struck down a lower court's ruling that had ordered the company to alter the way it sold its software for navigating the Internet. The decision was a setback for the Justice Department and for Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who issued the order last year requiring Microsoft to offer its Windows operating system software separate from its software for navigating the World Wide Web.
6/24/1998	Excerpts From Appeals Court Ruling on Microsoft	Following are excerpts from the decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturning the injunction against the Microsoft Corporation. Judges A. Raymond Randolph and Stephen F. Williams found for the company; Judge Patricia M. Wald dissented in part. We find that the district court erred procedurally in entering a preliminary injunction without notice to Microsoft and substantively in its implicit construction of the consent decree on which the preliminary injunction rested....
6/23/1998	Goldman, Sachs in Talks With Cliveden	Goldman, Sachs & Company, the richest investment banking partnership, may be headed for a conflict with its client William H. Gates, the world's richest man. The New York-based Goldman said today that one of its real estate funds and a partner were in talks to buy the British hotel company Cliveden P.L.C., whose flagship property is a former Astor family manor outside London. Last week, Destination Europe Ltd., owned by a group that includes Mr. Gates, the chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation, agreed to buy Cliveden for $:42.8 million ($71 million).
6/19/1998	Gates Part of Group Buying Hotel Company	A consortium of American investors, including William H. Gates of the Microsoft Corporation, said today that it had agreed to acquire the British luxury hotel company Cliveden P.L.C. for $:42.8 million, or $71.1 million. The consortium consists of Destination Europe, which is owned by two real estate investment firms, Lowe Enterprises and LF Strategic Realty Investors, and Cascade, Mr. Gates's investment company.
6/18/1998	Getting Ready for Windows 98, Microsoft Adds Tech Support	For months, Microsoft has billed Windows 98 as a move toward software simplicity and automated technical support, but the company doesn't seem to believe its own claims. In anticipation of the operating system's arrival on retailers' shelves next week, Microsoft has increased its technical support staff by 400, to more than 1,000. Microsoft has been touting Windows 98 features that help customers diagnose and fix problems without making support calls. Nonetheless, said Kim Akers, a Windows 98 product manager, ''we wanted to insure that if people did run into problems they couldn't solve themselves, they'd be able to have those addressed quickly.''
6/16/1998	Microsoft and Compaq to Buy 10% Stakes in Road Runner	The Microsoft Corporation and the Compaq Computer Corporation said yesterday that they would each invest $212.5 million for 10 percent stakes in Road Runner, the high-speed cable-modem joint venture of Time Warner Inc., Time Warner Entertainment/Advance-Newhouse and the Mediaone Group. Analysts said the deal reflected the interest of Microsoft and Compaq in fostering the growth of high-speed Internet connections for home users. For most users, the Internet experience is limited by the amount of information that can be squeezed through a telephone line.
6/16/1998	Times Guide to Entertainment Opens on the Internet Today	Entering a market crowded with some of the biggest companies in cyberspace, The New York Times Company said yesterday that it would introduce an Internet service about entertainment, restaurants and shopping in New York City and its suburbs. The site, called New York Today, will be available, starting today, at www.nytoday.com. The service will compete with New York Sidewalk from Microsoft, Digital Cities New York from America Online and Citysearch New York from Citysearch, a privately held company. All the companies are seeking a share of the rich market for local advertising, which includes classified advertising, yellow pages listings, outdoor, broadcast and print ads.
6/15/1998	Most Approve Of Microsoft, A Poll Shows	The Government's antitrust battle against the Microsoft Corporation has not tarnished the company's reputation as an outstanding business that makes high-quality products. But according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, a majority of Americans do think that Microsoft is a monopoly and that the Justice Department should continue to investigate the company and its business practices. Both in a nationwide telephone poll last week and in follow-up interviews, people again and again expressed deep admiration for the accomplishments of Microsoft and William H. Gates, the company's famous co-founder and chairman. Yet the same people repeatedly said there was an important role for the Government to play to make sure that fair play was maintained in the high-technology economy that Microsoft has come to symbolize.
6/15/1998	With a New Smart Suite, Lotus Chases Its Rivals' Success	This week the Lotus Development Corporation will begin shipping the Smart Suite Millennium Edition, which includes the latest version of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, word processing, data base, graphics and other productivity software. The question is does anyone care. Battered by the relentless onslaught of Microsoft, Lotus has seen its market share in desktop software dwindle so low that many analysts no longer bother to track it. Although Smart Suite has often been praised by reviewers and users as a cleaner, less-cluttered alternative to Microsoft's Office 97, Microsoft's ability to tie the applications to the Windows operating system has proved an unbeatable advantage.
6/13/1998	Grammatically Incorrect	Microsoft has many detractors, but no one has noticed its most egregious sin. The company's word-processing program, Word for Windows 95, is ruining the English language. I have just discovered that Word's grammar check has a command of English equal to that of Tarzan.
1/2/2014	Readying the Slingshot for a Modern Goliath	DAVID BOIES is the former Cravath, Swaine & Moore superstar trial lawyer in the cheap suits and stretch limousines who has defended some of the biggest legal game of the last 30 years: I.B.M. in its 13-year fight with the Government, CBS in the libel suit brought by Gen. William C. Westmoreland, and the nation's failed savings-and-loans against Michael R. Milken. Now he is the Government's chief lawyer in the snazziest antitrust lawsuit of the 1990's: United States v. Microsoft. Tough case? ''Not really,'' he said. ''To be honest.''
6/12/1998	New Chips Threaten Microsoft as Well as Intel	To the Editor: David Patterson (Op-Ed, June 9) states that the continued trend toward low-cost microprocessors makes Intel vulnerable. This applies to Microsoft as well.
6/12/1998	New Chips Threaten Microsoft as Well as Intel	To the Editor: David Patterson (Op-Ed, June 9), like those defending Microsoft, focuses on the technology virtues of Intel. But as with Microsoft, both companies appear to have used their monopoly power unfairly. If so, they broke the law. In the past only large, well-established companies worried about antitrust. The high-tech companies, all of whom were small only a few years back, never gave it a moment's thought -- as they competed ferociously. Had their executives (and lawyers) a modicum of sense, they would have seen the risks and avoided what is often flagrant abuse.
6/11/1998	My Own Personal Antitrust Action	AS a child, I liked to rip off mattress tags, the kind that threatened prosecution to anyone who removed them. So I was excited to learn a few days ago about a simple shareware program that allows a computer user to deface the Windows operating system in much the same way. Of course, the program, called Logo Manager, doesn't do actual damage to Windows, any more than removing that tag makes a mattress lumpy. The program simply enables a user to bypass the Microsoft start-up screen, which pops up on the monitor each time the computer is booted.
6/11/1998	A Long Way From Simplicity	To the Editor: It seems Microsoft's simplicity commitment has not yet been implemented (''Do Computers Have to Be Hard to Use?'' May 28). How does Microsoft intend to make things simpler? Microsoft touts voice recognition and gesture recognition! Are these people from Mars?
6/10/1998	Correction	An Op-Ed article yesterday on the Government's antitrust action against Intel misidentified the operating system Microsoft supplied to I.B.M. in 1981. I.B.M. used DOS, not Windows, for its first personal computers.
6/10/1998	Judge to Limit Witnesses in Microsoft Suit	Trying to avert a lengthy proceeding, a Federal judge said today that he planned to limit the number of witnesses the Microsoft Corporation and the Government may call during the September trial for the antitrust suits filed by the Justice Department and 20 states. After meeting privately with lawyers for both sides just before a court hearing this morning, District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said, ''It is my expectation to enter an order limiting the number of witnesses to between 6 and 12 each.'' Further, the judge added, direct testimony should be submitted in writing in advance and court testimony limited to cross-examinations.
6/10/1998	U.S. and Industry Discuss Data Encryption	Leading computing executives, including Microsoft's chief executive, William H. Gates, huddled for two hours today with Attorney General Janet Reno and the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to discuss disagreements between the industry and the Government over data scrambling. After the meeting, the White House said it hoped that the talks would lead to an easing of export restrictions on data encryption technology by fall.
6/8/1998	Small Company Builds on Edge Of Microsoft's Real Estate	A tiny company in Seattle is introducing a technology today that industry analysts say could loosen the Microsoft Corporation's firm grip on the valuable real estate of personal computer screens. Microsoft sets the rules for how the main screens, or desktops, are used because its Windows operating system has a near-monopoly in the personal computer market. Personal computer makers are permitted to put icons for starting software programs on the main Windows screen, but only within the Windows environment and in compliance with contract restrictions imposed by Microsoft.
6/4/1998	Acquisition of Ciena by Tellabs, and the Power of Lucent	Just as the Ciena Corporation was announcing yesterday that it had agreed to be acquired by Tellabs Inc. for about $7.1 billion in stock, Lucent Technologies Inc. was illustrating why Ciena saw little future in remaining independent. Ciena had an early lead on Lucent -- and the rest of the telecommunications industry -- in making a complex type of equipment that can increase the capacity of long-distance networks by a factor of 16 or more.
6/4/1998	Operating Systems; Windows 95 and Its Smaller Sibling	MICROSOFT'S colossal Windows 95 and its two-year-old little brother, Windows CE, do essentially the same thing: act as the computer's central nervous system and traffic cop, determining how all other software will operate. Windows 95 and its forthcoming upgrade, Windows 98, run on desktops and notebooks with lots of moving parts, like CD-ROM drives and mice. Windows CE runs on computers with no moving parts except, in certain models, their keyboards. It first showed up on handheld computers, then palmtop computers, and it is now running on the new PC companions, which look like tiny notebook computers but are really just handhelds with larger keyboards and color screens. Instead of a mouse, the CE devices get their on-screen cues from a penlike stylus that is used for tapping icons and menus on touch-sensitive displays.
6/1/1998	Intel and the Threat of Low-Cost Chips	So inextricably linked are the dual monopolies of the Intel Corporation's microprocessors and the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating systems in desktop computing that industry watchers commonly describe them in a single word: Wintel. Yet, the paradox of Intel is that the Government is seeking to limit the chip maker's ''monopolistic practices'' at a time when the company is facing its greatest level of competition in more than a decade.
5/31/1998	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the possible effects on technology investments from antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation misstated the location of Sand Hill Road, a California center for venture capital firms. It is in Menlo Park, not Palo Alto.
5/29/1998	Intel and Microsoft Face Differing Antitrust Paths	Lawyers for the Intel Corporation should be well acquainted with antitrust inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission -- a process different from the one followed in Justice Department antitrust cases -- because the commission has been investigating the microprocessor giant off and on throughout this decade. In 1991, the agency began an antitrust investigation of Intel based on complaints that the company was illegally trying to squeeze smaller chip makers out of business.
5/29/1998	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about a lawsuit filed by 20 states against the Microsoft Corporation misidentified the antitrust officials who contend that the company's pricing policies for its Office suite of programs leave computer makers with the practical choice of installing the software on all their computers or none. They are the states' attorneys general, not staff members of the Justice Department.

5/28/1998	How Many Bill Gateses Does It Take to Change a Light Bulb?	FASTER than a speeding O.J. joke, able to leap large oceans in a single cc'd E-mail, the yuks over Microsoft's latest contretemps with the Justice Department are spreading, viruslike, across the monitors of America -- many via Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer, the traitorous finks. As happens after any disaster that threatens the Dow Jones average and the free market system as we know it, the antitrust suits that were filed last week spawned spoofs in all the familiar joke structures. This week, characters from Microsoft appeared in the stock schticks: Bill Gates at the Pearly Gates, programmers confronted with a genie and three wishes, Top 10 lists galore.
5/28/1998	Microsoft Gives A Freer Hand To Gateway	Gateway Inc. offered yesterday a glimpse of the future that the Government is seeking in its antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation: more freedom for personal computer makers, and less control by Microsoft over precisely what people see on their computer screens. After months of prodding, Gateway, a large personal computer maker, was able to gain through negotiations the kind of freedom the Government wants to impose by law. Microsoft relented only after the Justice Department became curious. Indeed, Microsoft's resistance to Gateway's requests until two weeks ago figures into the Government's suit, in depositions Justice Department investigators took from Gateway executives.
5/28/1998	Microsoft and Sega Creating Windows-Based Game System	In keeping with the far reach Microsoft is striving for -- both on and off the desktop -- the company announced plans last week to collaborate with Sega Enterprises Ltd. on a home video game system based on Windows CE. The partnership marks Microsoft's first venture into home console video games.
5/27/1998	Microsoft Has A Stronghold In Office Suites	When employees of the New York Attorney General's office sat down last week to prepare the final draft of the multistate lawsuit accusing the Microsoft Corporation of monopolistic, anticompetitive behavior, they typed the document using Microsoft Word, the word processor installed on the office's computers as part of a group of business programs known as Office. ''We have Windows 95 and the Microsoft Office suite,'' Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco acknowledged with a rueful chuckle.
5/27/1998	Internet Monopoly?	To the Editor: Re ''Antitrust Excesses?'' (Op-Ed, May 20): The best outcome for all concerned, except Microsoft, would be a free-market solution.
5/27/1998	Microsoft and ICL of Britain In 'Enterprise Computing' Pact	The Microsoft Corporation, which already enjoys a virtual monopoly in operating systems for personal computers, today announced a European alliance that will make it a formidable contender in the network operating systems that connect many types of computers throughout an entire company. Microsoft said it had signed an agreement with the British information systems developer ICL P.L.C. under which ICL will promote and market Microsoft's products in the retail, government and education sectors throughout Europe.
5/27/1998	Internet Monopoly?	To the Editor: Robert E. Hall (Op-Ed, May 20) misses the mark when he claims that Microsoft's practice of bundling a variety of software packages has been a ''boon for consumers'' because they get free software with Windows.
5/26/1998	High-Tech Hypocrisy About Government	In the mid-1980's, during my tenure at Lotus, I was, I believe, the first person to publicly compare Microsoft to Standard Oil. Both companies sought and used monopoly control over a new industry critical to the nation's economy. And both were headed by men -- John D. Rockefeller Sr. and Bill Gates -- who would stop at virtually nothing to gain what they sought. Back then no one took the comparison seriously -- except Bill Gates himself, who made it clear to me how irate he was about it. Like Mr. Gates, I believe in and have profited from the free market. But I'm also a technorealist, which means that unlike many of my colleagues in the high-tech industry, I don't automatically see Government as the enemy of technological progress. Such views are all too fashionable in Silicon Valley, where the prospect of Government intervention causes a bad case of heartburn.
5/26/1998	'Microsofties' Say They're Right as Rain	Of all the Government's affronts that the Microsoft Corporation feels it has had to endure, including a request that it ship a competitor's product with its own, the most galling to many here at One Microsoft Way was the admission last week by Attorney General Janet Reno that she did not use a personal computer. Much of the nation might have taken little notice of Ms. Reno's remark, but for the troops of technologists who breathe life into machines, it suggests a revealing explanation for the landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft -- a suit that otherwise simply did not compute here.
5/25/1998	Still Another Adversary for Microsoft	Netscape, Netscape, Netscape. The Microsoft Corporation's rival in the browser market is mentioned 130 times in the Government's antitrust complaint and a supporting memorandum. Yet while the Justice Department's case focuses mainly on the browser market, another bitter Microsoft competitor makes a few cameo appearances in the court papers filed last Monday -- Sun Microsystems Inc.
5/25/1998	If Microsoft Loses, Consumers Will Win; Hardly Innovative	To the Editor: In defending Microsoft's position in the antitrust dispute, Bill Gates warns that the Government may destroy innovation (editorial, May 19). And in a full-page advertisement on May 19, he mentions ''innovation'' several time. His message is that curtailing Microsoft's actions would stifle innovation. But what is innovative about bundling Microsoft's browser with Windows 98? MAX FOGIEL Piscataway, N.J., May 20, 1998
5/25/1998	If Microsoft Loses, Consumers Will Win; Word Dominates	To the Editor: Robert E. Hall was doing fine in ''Antitrust Excess?'' (Op-Ed, May 20) until he wrote that ''Wordperfect, for example, still competes effectively against Microsoft Word.''
5/25/1998	Technology; 'Baby Softs'? Envisioning A Breakup Of Microsoft	Now that the Justice Department and the Attorneys General of 20 states have filed long-threatened antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation, the question remains why the most obvious, and perhaps cleanest, solution has yet to be put on the bargaining table: the breakup of Microsoft into its component businesses. Many analysts and industry executives have noted that the complex, arcane lawsuits filed last week are probably too closely tied to the software giant's current products and business strategies to have any lasting effect. Demands regarding Windows 98, for example, or even specific concessions to Microsoft competitors like the Netscape Communications Corporation will probably be outdated in a matter of months as technology continues to change at its usual breakneck pace.
5/25/1998	Netscape Plays It Cool as Rival Is Sued	The Netscape Communications Corporation has done a lot of crowing in the last week. It announced it had won a big contract to supply Citibank with software for electronic commerce. It outlined details of its new strategy to turn itself into a Web-based information service in competition with America Online and Yahoo. And, oh yes, the Justice Department and 20 states filed antitrust suits against its archrival, the Microsoft Corporation.
5/25/1998	Her Mother Isn't Pleased As Daughter Rips Gates	In the acknowledgments of her new book, ''Barbarians Led by Bill Gates: Microsoft From the Inside,'' the author, Jennifer Edstrom, thanks her mother for encouraging her to write, ''even though this isn't particularly what she had in mind.'' Since 1982, Ms. Edstrom's mother, Pam, has helped shape the public image of the Microsoft Corporation's chairman, first as a Microsoft employee and then as an executive of the public relations firm that represents him. When she learned about preparations for her daughter's book, a behind-the-scenes account co-written with a former Microsoft software developer, Marlin Eller, she tried, the daughter said, to dissuade her from writing it.
5/25/1998	Web Coverage Of Microsoft By Microsoft	They were born to be incestuous. But even so, it is remarkable how much of the coverage offered by the Microsoft-owned on-line magazine Slate and by MSNBC, the cable network and Web site in which the software giant is a partner, has been about the Microsoft Corporation. That coverage has been hard to avoid, with the Justice Department's filing on Monday making Microsoft's business practices the focus of the most sweeping antitrust charges in a generation. MSNBC devoted several segments to the case on Monday and Tuesday; its Web site featured the antitrust issue as its lead report on Monday, though by Tuesday afternoon it had dropped deeper inside the Web site, leading the business page and not being featured on the home page.
5/25/1998	If Microsoft Loses, Consumers Will Win; The Copyright Solution	To the Editor: The only certainty about the flood of antitrust lawsuits unleashed by the government against Microsoft (editorial, May 20) is that they will last many years and cost many millions of dollars. Worse, they are unlikely to produce the desired result. There is a simpler alternative: a change in copyright law.
5/24/1998	VIEWPOINT; Why Microsoft Should Be Left Alone	Bhaskar Chakravorti, senior member of global consulting practice of Monitor Co, scores antitrust actions against Microsoft Corp; says basic lesson is that technology markets, properly understood, require no more regulatory intervention than other markets; holds regulators need only increase speed of competitive dynamic by helping to establish technological standards and by insuring flow of innovation through enforcement of intellectual property rights (M)
5/24/1998	Fidelity Follows a Crowd It Shunned	WHAT a difference a year makes. In early 1997, Fidelity Investments took to the road, trying to rally the flagging confidence of its mutual fund shareholders in a series of road-show meetings. At the time, relative performance of its big stock funds was off, almost across the board, and Fidelity executives were feeling the heat. The question from investors was: Why the poor results?
5/24/1998	In Analysts' Eyes, Microsoft Is Still a Giant With Legs	THE Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation is expected to be long and arduous. Shareholders naturally wonder what it bodes for the stock. On Wall Street, many analysts are cautiously optimistic for a fairly painless settlement, but they expect the stock to underperform in the meantime. Several money managers who hold the stock offered their takes on its prospects while the legal wheels turn, and thereafter:
5/24/1998	U.S. and 20 States File Antitrust Suits	LAST MONDAY, as the Department of Justice and 20 state Attorneys General filed their antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation, a question circulated among the venture capitalists huddled in partners meetings on Palo Alto's Sand Hill Road and other nerve centers of high-technology finance. Is it safe again to invest in desktop software?
5/24/1998	Washington Sideshow for Technology	LET the competition begin to write the first rough drafts of the Bill Gates chapter in American history. By the time the Justice Department filed its broad antitrust suits last week, the argument in some quarters had already come down to how much Bill Gates is like John D. Rockefeller, whose Standard Oil made him the most famed monopolist of a century ago.
5/24/1998	The Nation; How To Break Up Microsoft	STACKED against the landmark antitrust cases of the past, the actions taken by Department of Justice against Microsoft last week are pint-sized. The behemoth Standard Oil Company was broken up more than 80 years ago into 34 refining companies, pipelines and other pieces. AT&T was broken up into one long-distance and seven regional phone companies. The Government spent 13 years trying to dismantle I.B.M. before dropping the effort in 1982 out of exhaustion. All the Government wanted from Microsoft last week was less heavy-handed behavior. According to the Justice Department, Microsoft exploits its monopoly of Windows, the operating system that runs about 90 percent of the nation's personal computers, to dominate sales of many other products and services. As proof, the Government points to contracts Microsoft has with computer manufacturers and companies selling services over the Internet that prevent them from steering customers to Microsoft's competitors. These and other exclusionary practices, all based on the dependence of Microsoft's partners on Windows, make it likely that Microsoft will dominate the market for browsers -- the software that connects personal computers to the Internet -- and maybe even the markets for real estate, travel and other commercial services available on line.
5/23/1998	Microsoft Case Is Set for Trial In September	Rejecting the Microsoft Corporation's request for a considerable delay, a United States District Court judge ordered a fast-track schedule this morning for the Federal and state lawsuits filed against the software company on Monday, setting a trial date just three and a half months from today. The decision calmed fears of Government lawyers that the case might drag on so long that rapid advances in the software industry would make it irrelevant, as happened with the Government's last lawsuit against Microsoft.
5/23/1998	Microsoft Case Gets September Trial Date	A Federal judge rejected Microsoft's request for a considerable delay, and ordered a fast-track schedule for the Federal and state lawsuits that were filed against the software company on Monday, setting a trial date for Sept. 8.
5/22/1998	Microsoft Fires First Salvo In Antitrust Fight With U.S.	The legal trench warfare in the Microsoft antitrust case began yesterday as the embattled software maker asked a Federal judge to give it seven months to prepare for a hearing. The Government and 20 states, which filed suits against Microsoft on Monday, will ask the court to move far more quickly, probably within four to six weeks. They say Microsoft's request is merely an effort to stall the case, allowing the rapid pace of change in the software business to render the legal issues obsolete.
5/22/1998	Motorola Drops Plan for Its Own Data Satellites	Motorola Inc. announced yesterday that it had agreed to scrap its $12.9 billion plan to build a satellite network capable of delivering high-speed data communications anywhere on earth and instead join a rival but equally ambitious project to build an ''Internet in the sky.'' Motorola said it would invest about $750 million in exchange for 26 percent of the project, Teledesic L.L.C., which was founded by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and Craig O. McCaw, the cellular phone pioneer who sold his company to AT&T in 1993 for $12.6 billion.
5/21/1998	U.S. v. MICROSOFT; The Kitchen Sink Operating System	Over the years, Microsoft has continually worked to improve and expand its personal computer operating system by acquiring, licensing and developing new technologies. These constant upgrades have made the system the industry standard and given it a virtual stranglehold on the world of personal computers. At the same time, companies that pioneered some of these technologies have found their products becoming irrelevant as Microsoft added features that replicated those products' functions. Here is a chronology of some of the more significant steps in the evolution of Microsoft's operating system. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN
5/21/1998	Microsoft: Consumers' Savior or Evil Empire?	To the Editor: As a former employee of the Justice Department's antitrust division, I disagree with Robert E. Hall's article on Microsoft (''Antitrust Excess?'', Op-Ed, May 20). The essence of competition is ''free entry'' to a market, and the antitrust law considers efforts to restrict entry as a violation of the law.
5/21/1998	Thinking Convergence	To the Editor: It's hard to believe the mighty Microsoft has missed the mark on this one (''PC Makers Cool to Microsoft's Push for Web TV,'' May 14). Do I want to turn my PC into a smaller and much more expensive TV? Of course not. For the same reason I don't use my car as an overpriced nutcracker: that's not why I bought it.
5/21/1998	Microsoft: Consumers' Savior or Evil Empire?	To the Editor: You report (front page, May 19) that Microsoft likens a provision that would require it to carry the browser of another company on Windows to telling Coke to include a couple of cans of Pepsi in every six-pack. That's specious reasoning. Coke does not control 80 percent of its delivery system.
5/21/1998	After Windows 98: The Future According to Microsoft	THE fight between the Microsoft Corporation and the Department of Justice has placed Windows 98, the upgrade to the Windows 95 operating system, under a microscope. But in the fast-paced world of software development, Windows 98 is already yesterday's news -- it may be shipping now, but it went into development nearly three years ago. At a news conference on Monday, the day the Government filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, defended his company's ''right to innovate on behalf of consumers'' while vowing to ''continue to create great software.''
5/21/1998	U.S. v. MICROSOFT: THE MARKET; Microsoft Suit's Earliest Result: Surge of Buyers	The Government's sweeping antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation is already having an impact in the marketplace, though an unintended one. Computer stores that are offering promotions allowing shoppers to reserve or buy Microsoft's next-generation operating system, Windows 98, before it goes on sale on June 25 are reporting a surprisingly strong surge of orders.
5/21/1998	Microsoft: Consumers' Savior or Evil Empire?	To the Editor: The Justice Department attacks Microsoft, but to protect whom (front page, May 20)? Not the consumer but a competitor, with perhaps a better product, but a product that is available to anyone who wants to buy it and spend five minutes setting it up. No one with a computer catalogue is forced to buy Microsoft.
5/21/1998	Microsoft: Consumers' Savior or Evil Empire?	To the Editor: William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, has frequently demonstrated his ignorance of the reasons for our antitrust laws. His statement that the Government ''would put everything we've worked for and built for the last 23 years at risk'' shows he believes that Microsoft's having achieved success, it no longer should be at risk (front page, May 18). But the essence of business is that there is return for risk and that if there is no risk, there should be no return.
5/21/1998	U.S. v. MICROSOFT: THE SPIN; Analogies As Complex And Murky As the Case	Monday's showdown at the Windows 98 Corral may not have been dueling six-shooters at 20 paces, but it was certainly dueling metaphors at 3,000 miles. And by the time the smoke had cleared in Washington East and Washington West, both sides had shot themselves in the foot. The software business, with its bits and bytes, mega-this, giga-that and bottomless cache of impenetrable jargon, has always presented an arcane world to a bemused public.
5/21/1998	Microsoft: Consumers' Savior or Evil Empire?	To the Editor: Re ''Left and Right With Bill Gates'' (editorial, May 20): In an industry in which multimillion-dollar mistakes are common, Microsoft doesn't stumble often, whereas Apple Computer was (and still is) unwilling to license its technology, I.B.M. failed to impress the industry with its OS/2 operating system, and Netscape's wonderkids appear hostage to punitive market forces tired of ''we're a big player'' promises and no deliveries.
5/21/1998	U.S. v. MICROSOFT: THE CASE; Separating Fixations From Fixes	Many analysts predict that the Government's attempt to protect the Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator browser from the onslaught of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser will prove futile. Larry Dietz, vice president of Zona Research, a Northern California company that conducts market research on Internet use, reflects a common view when he observes that individual computer buyers want a browser ''that is fast, easy and cheap.''
5/20/1998	Left and Right With Bill Gates	The legal impact of the lawsuits against Microsoft was accompanied by a more subtle upheaval in the ideological realm. The old certainties of conservative opposition to government intervention, fixed since the Reagan era, are shifting on this issue. New technologies, new business rules and, perhaps most important, the power of lobbying and campaign money are producing odd new alliances and redefining what is left and right and who is up or down. Take, for example, the unexpected Republican support for Attorney General Janet Reno's antitrust activism. Her hand has been strengthened immeasurably because of the backing she commands from Orrin Hatch, one of the chief critics of her chronic passivity on campaign finance. Mr. Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, represents a state with at least one big software rival of Microsoft. Ms. Reno has also benefited by the fact that Trent Lott uttered not a peep of criticism about the Clinton Administration's handling of Microsoft, and Newt Gingrich sounded downright approving. The company's G.O.P. defenders are much less weighty figures such as its home-state Senator, Slade Gorton, and that ever-grumpy ideologue, Dick Armey.
5/20/1998	Microsoft Fight Will Be Waged On Wide Front	The Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation is shaping up as a high-decibel, often nasty battle to sway public opinion as well as the courts. The Justice Department and the 20 states suing the company will use an array of tools: talk-show appearances, documents that cast Microsoft as an arrogant monopolist, testimonials from distinguished academics, and scarcely veiled threats of even further charges.
5/20/1998	For Congress, Even Computer Politics Are Local	To Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, the antitrust suit against his state's most valuable company shows that the Clinton Administration is trying to have judges and lawyers design the future of the computer industry. In contrast, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, home of a major competitor of the Microsoft Corporation, is filled with praise that is extraordinary from a Republican for the Clinton Administration.
5/20/1998	Inside Beltway, Microsoft Sheds Its Image as Outsider	Whether it is giving free computer software to the Republicans, making hefty campaign contributions or hiring some of Washington's priciest and best-connected lobbyists, the Microsoft Corporation is quickly maturing from a novice in the ways of Washington to one of the most active players on Capitol Hill. As the Justice Department and Senate investigators have challenged Microsoft's grip on the computer industry, the company has gone on a spending spree in the last few months to gain better access to key lawmakers and regulators. It has even made available to Congress top Microsoft officials, most notably its chairman, William H. Gates, who has star power even among the most jaded of politicians.
5/20/1998	In Seattle, Bill Gates Is Still a Hometown Hero	The money-making machine at the Microsoft Corporationpurred along today, the soldiers of software touting their new operating system while assuring friends and colleagues that no, the ride was not over. Not by any stretch. What the Government did this week -- filing a suit that called Microsoft a predatory monopolist, using its dominance of personal computer operating systems to control future innovations -- may be the antitrust action that defines commerce for much of the next century.
5/19/1998	Excerpts From the Government's Lawsuit Filed Against Microsoft	The following are excerpts from a complaint filed against Microsoft by the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
5/19/1998	Excerpts From the Lawsuit Filed by 20 State Attorneys General	The following are excerpts from the complaint filed yesterday against Microsoft by 20 state Atorneys General in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
5/19/1998	On TV, a Defiant Gates Faults Tactics by U.S.	A defiant William H. Gates took to a television studio stage today on the Microsoft Corporation's campus to defend his company's business practices and to assert that by filing broad antitrust lawsuits against his company, the Government and a group of state Attorneys General were threatening the pace of technological innovation in the personal computer industry. ''Federal and state regulators have taken the unprecedented step of intervening in America's most successful and growing industry by trying to design software,'' a stern-looking Mr. Gates said to a group of reporters in the studio and others watching around the world.
5/19/1998	Where Fine Lines Blur	The Government explained its landmark antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation today as a principled defense of the time-tested, bedrock values of capitalism, protecting consumer choice and economic competition from the predatory assault of a modern monopolist. Standing before a battery of television cameras and lights, Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, described the case at times in business-as-usual terms. The principles, he insisted, were clear-cut; the remedies asked of the court were limited, and the theories behind the case were standard antitrust doctrine.
5/19/1998	U.S. AND 20 STATES FILE SUITS CLAIMING MICROSOFT BLOCKS COMPETITION OVER INTERNET	The Federal Government and 20 state Attorneys General filed two broad, aggressive antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation today, launching the most concerted government attack on a single company in a generation. The suits accuse the world's most powerful software company of using its monopoly in personal computer operating systems to win control of the Internet and software products, particularly browsers, which are necessary for viewing and interacting with the World Wide Web.
5/19/1998	Stopping a Monopoly from Begetting Others	Some monopolies are good -- or at least inevitable. When the Department of Justice and 20 state Attorneys General filed antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation yesterday, the issue was not whether the company's industry-dominating Windows software operating system constituted a monopoly. With Windows serving as the command-and-control system for approximately 90 percent of all new personal computers, monopoly power is assumed -- and there is nothing illegal about that.
5/19/1998	U.S. V. MICROSOFT: THE REACTION -- A Goliath Needs the Little Guys; Microsoft Faces Challenge of Image Among Consumers	As news of the Justice Department's impending historic assault on Microsoft spread this weekend, Robert Nolfe, 32, headed for his local computer superstore in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank, not far from the headquarters of the Walt Disney Company. Having just designed his own Web site with Microsoft's word processing program, he was looking for a fancier tool: Microsoft Front Page. ''We should be happy to have a great American company like Microsoft,'' said Mr. Nolfe, an accountant. ''The products have been great and the price has been right. The Government shouldn't blow a whistle just because it's a success.''
5/19/1998	No Sympathy for Gates in Parts of Silicon Valley	The Microsoft Corporation's many dependents offered a muted reaction to today's suits by the Department of Justice and state Attorneys General, but the software maker's outspoken adversaries called the action a major step toward dismantling its dominance. The most forceful reaction came from Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman and chief executive of the Oracle Corporation, who ridiculed Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, for calling the lawsuits harmful to American innovation.
5/19/1998	United States v. Microsoft	In their sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft, the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general have made reasonable demands to preserve competition in the world of computers and the Internet. Bill Gates needs to respond with something better than disingenuous countercharges that his company is being punished for its success. Instead of forcing a protracted court battle over remedies, Microsoft should work with Federal and state lawyers to reshape the marketplace to help consumers obtain the products they may want. A sense of history was in the air as Joel Klein, director of the Justice Department's antitrust division, stepped forward in Washington, D.C., to charge Microsoft with engaging in predatory conduct to choke off its rivals. Within hours, Mr. Gates and his phalanx of lawyers in Redmond, Wash., warned that the Government was in danger of destroying innovation and enterprise in the country's most dynamic business sector. He made no concession to the idea that Microsoft had used its monopoly in personal computer operating systems to force computer makers to favor its other software products.
5/18/1998	U.S. vs. Private Industry: A Look Back	If the Justice Department and Attorneys General of 20 states file antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft today, as they are expected to do, the ensuing fight could be one of the biggest ever between the Government and private industry over what constitutes unfair monopolistic business practices. Here are some of the biggest past cases. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN
5/18/1998	Long Before Microsoft's Internet War: A Peaceful Ethernet	Robert Metcalfe looks at the Microsoft civil war and other open hostilities in the software industry and remembers when the computer business was a kinder, gentler place to work. But that was long before Microsoft's current battle with Federal and state governments and before the various other intramural industry fights in which one company or coalition strives to use control of a key technology as a means of gaining market dominance.
5/18/1998	Antitrust Talks Founder On Microsoft's 'Desktop'	The stakes and the drama, it seemed, could scarcely be higher. The Microsoft Corporation, emblematic titan of the nation's high-tech economy, was locked in last-minute, closed-door negotiations with the Justice Department and 20 state Attorneys General. The goal was to find a way to avert a major antitrust suit -- a confrontation that could rival the Government's assault on Standard Oil early this century in defining the ground rules of competition for decades to come. Early Saturday afternoon, word spread that the talks had collapsed.
5/17/1998	Reaching for the Escape Key	Negotiations between the Microsoft Corporation and state and Federal officials collapsed today after the company's chairman, William H. Gates, ordered lawyers to withdraw earlier concessions, and Justice Department officials said they intended to file a sweeping antitrust suit on Monday. A senior representative of the state Attorneys General who were also involved in the negotiations said 20 states would file their own suit on Monday unless Microsoft offered significant new concessions before then.
5/17/1998	Antitrust Talks With Microsoft Are Called Off	Microsoft's last-minute gesture toward the Justice Department, a new-found taste for compromise in the hopes of avoiding a major antitrust suit, speaks volumes about the company. It may have a take-no-prisoners corporate culture and an antagonism toward Washington but, as any accomplished capitalist, the Microsoft Corporation is ultimately guided by the pure logic of business.
5/15/1998	Ever a Pragmatist, Microsoft Compromises	Less than an hour before state and Federal governments were set to file sweeping antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation, the company announced today that it would postpone the release of its new operating system, Windows 98, for three days so that settlement talks could proceed. The Justice Department had scheduled a noon news conference to announce its new suit, and attorneys general from several of the 20 states that were going to file a joint action had flown to Washington to stand with Janet Reno, the United States Attorney General, for the announcement. Politicians' statements had been drafted, and press releases had been printed.
5/15/1998	MICROSOFT SEEKS ACCORD WITH U.S. AND DODGES SUIT	For all the attention Microsoft's antitrust confrontation with the Justice Department has received, for all the headlines and all the commentary on the subject, it often seems that the Government is stepping into what is essentially an intramural spat within the software industry. To most people, the debate quickly becomes a baffling excursion into the arcane language of computing -- Web browsers, operating systems and Internet programming languages. And it is, after all, a dispute that pits the very rich software mavens from the Netscape Communica tions Corporation against the incomprehensibly rich ones from the Microsoft Corporation.
5/14/1998	Software and Hardball	One of the few innovations in Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system is the integration of television-viewing software, but many makers of personal computers are giving it the cold shoulder. Microsoft, which has aggressively been trying to gain a foothold in cable and high-definition television, has been offering manufacturers significant discounts on Windows 98 if they agree to install television-tuner cards as standard equipment on their new computers. The cards, which cost roughly between $50 and $130, enable computer users to watch television on their monitors.
5/14/1998	PC Makers Cool to Microsoft's Push for WebTV	DESIGNERS have a phrase for it: ''lock-in.'' From the roll of toilet paper four and a half inches wide that fits toilet paper holders to the complex rules regulating digital video disks, certain shapes and sizes have become standards for their industries -- and not always the best ones. Like it or not, we are locked into a world in which faucets are arranged with hot on the left, cold on the right. Razor blades are designed to match razors. Batteries come in standard sizes. We live with plugs that fit outlets, telephones that fit jacks, bulbs that fit lamps -- and never really appreciate the convenience of it all until we come across the high-tech Italian halogen lamp that requires the nonstandard Italian halogen light bulb.
5/14/1998	Road Races Are a Challenge But Graphics Don't Keep Up	CART PRECISION RACING (Microsoft; $54.95; Windows 95 and NT.) IF a steady diet of left turns isn't for you, this simulator provides a mix of high-speed ovals and twisty road-racing courses, negotiated in a much faster and more technologically exotic form of racer: the Indy car. Like Nascar Racing 2, however, CART Precision Racing does not contain the most famous racetrack of all, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Thanks to the real-world politics of motor sports, that race is part of the rival Indy Racing League series (which licenses its own simulation game through ABC Sports).
5/13/1998	ANTITRUST ACTION AGAINST MICROSOFT IS CALLED IMMINENT	Only three days before it is scheduled to begin shipping Windows 98, the Microsoft Corporation is girding for an escalating round of lawsuits that could block the release of the latest version of its operating system and impose profound limits on the company's freedom to add features to future generations of Windows. The Federal Government and the Attorneys General of at least 12 states plan to file broad new antitrust suits against Microsoft as soon as Thursday. While the Justice Department has not disclosed its precise strategy, the states have come to general agreement on a complaint that ''will surprise some people,'' said a senior official in one Attorney General's office. The official added, ''It's going to be more far-reaching than most people expect.''
5/13/1998	Justice Department Expected To Seek Contract Restraints	The Government is expected to sue the Microsoft Corporation to place limits on the contracts the company strikes with personal computer makers, Internet service providers and Web site operators. In doing so, the Justice Department will argue that contracts must be limited to prevent Microsoft from using a monopoly in operating systems, both to unfairly protect its Windows stronghold and to extend its monopolistic reach into the new markets of Internet software and commerce. The use of monopoly power to maintain and expand a monopoly is a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.
5/11/1998	TV Listings Stir Windows 98 Dispute	Buyers of new personal computers equipped with Windows 98, Microsoft's updated operating system, are to get something thrown in free of charge: an electronic program guide that tells what is on television. Microsoft sees this as an attractive new service -- and, perhaps, a means to broaden its customer base. But a small, privately held Pennsylvania company that sells a similar piece of software already installed on several hundred thousand personal computers is crying foul.
5/11/1998	Support Grows For Faster Modem Speeds	Lending international support to an American effort to give consumers high-speed access to cyberspace, the largest foreign telecommunications companies have agreed to join an industry group to work on ways to transmit huge volumes of information over standard telephone wires. The group intends to announce today the membership of British Telecommunications, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Singapore Telecommunications, according to people involved with the organization, known as the Universal ADSL Working Group.
5/10/1998	Smashing Windows 98	The accelerating confrontation between Microsoft and the Justice Department seems likely to become one of the most bitter antitrust cases ever and perhaps one of the most important. The department may try to delay the debut of Windows 98, the next generation of Microsoft's operating system, while it looks for any predatory practices by Microsoft. The department is clearly right to try to promote competition in a fast-changing business. The question is whether it is being unfair to Microsoft, stifling innovation or demanding ''remedies'' that create more problems than they solve. In the world of computers, the battle over Microsoft has been likened to the fight over Standard Oil a century ago. The comparison is not that farfetched. John D. Rockefeller controlled 90 percent of American oil production, whereas Bill Gates controls 90 percent of the operating systems that are the lifeblood of the new American economy. The terms of the disputes may be highly technical, but the underlying drama is that of a morality play. Microsoft sees itself as the heroic pioneer being punished for success. The company's critics view it as an evil empire bent on killing its rivals. How the public judges the case will depend on the evidence of predatory conduct behind the scenes brought by the Justice Department.
5/8/1998	Microsoft Created Its Own Problems, Justice Dept. Says	In a strongly worded court brief filed today, the Justice Department argued that the Microsoft Corporation had known for months that its legal problems with the Government might delay the release of its Windows 98 operating system, due to be released next week. But Microsoft deliberately waited until the last minute to ask a court for protection, Government lawyers charged, so the company could make ''a self-generated claim of hardship.'' In other words, the Government argued, Microsoft is complaining about a problem of its own making.
5/6/1998	Microsoft Chief Takes To the Stump	To the Editor: Robert H. Bork, in his May 4 Op-Ed article advocating Netscape's case against Microsoft, cites Lorain Journal Company v. United States as ''directly on point'' with the case against Microsoft. The Lorain case, however, was concerned with the impending extinction of a radio broadcast station -- which invokes an important Federal interest. Netscape and its allies merely seek corporate welfare.
5/6/1998	No Monopoly on Line	William H. Gates, the Microsoft Corporation chairman, has paid more than $30 million for the last major seascape by Winslow Homer left in private hands, setting what is by far the record price for an American painting, experts in the art world said yesterday. The purchase catapults American fine art into the same financial stratosphere as European paintings. The price for the seascape is nearly three times the record for an American painting, which was set two years ago when ''Cashmere,'' by John Singer Sargent, sold for $11.1 million at Sotheby's.
5/4/1998	What Antitrust Is All About	Rarely does a prospective antitrust case roil public passion. But since it became known that I represent a company urging the Justice Department to challenge certain of Microsoft's business practices, my mail has certainly livened up. One letter writer complained that I had sold my ''sole.'' His spelling aside, that writer was at least kinder than the one who labeled me senile. There seems to be a widespread impression that the Microsoft controversy should be resolved by an ideological litmus test: liberals are bent on punishing success, and conservatives must defend Bill Gates's company from any application of the antitrust laws. But the question is not one of politics or ideology; it is one of law and economics. And that is why an outspoken free marketeer like me can be found arguing against Microsoft.
5/4/1998	Gates to Sell 1 Million Shares of Microsoft	William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a million shares of his software company's stock. The shares represent a small fraction -- about two-tenths of 1 percent -- of the approximately 538 million shares, or 22 percent of the company, which Mr. Gates owns. He sold four million shares in February.
5/4/1998	As U.S. Spars With Microsoft, Federal Offices Use Its Systems	Even as it steps up its antitrust pursuit of the Microsoft Corporation, the Government is becoming increasingly dependent on the company's software. The United States Army, Navy, Social Security Administration, Health and Human Services Department, Defense Logistics Agency, Postal Service, Coast Guard and, yes, the Justice Department, Microsoft's antitrust antagonist, have all started programs to use Microsoft software on tens of thousands of desktop computers.
5/4/1998	Software Fights Bring Former Foes Together	Forget politics. The Internet makes stranger bedfellows. The consumer advocate and corporate critic Ralph Nader, never a favorite of conservatives who oppose broad government regulation of business, now finds himself on the same side as Bob Dole and Robert H. Bork in their efforts to persuade the Justice Department to crack down on the Microsoft Corporation.
5/1/1998	Letter by Industry Executives Backs Microsoft	In the strongest show of support to date for the embattled Microsoft Corporation, 26 computer industry executives have written to the Justice Department saying that any delay in the introduction of Windows 98 will harm the computer industry. ''Our success depends on the freedom of Microsoft and the rest of America's personal computer industry to create new and innovative products,'' their letter says.
4/30/1998	Windows 98, The Tuneup	COMPUTER stores stayed open past midnight to accommodate long lines of customers when Microsoft's Windows 95 was released on Aug. 24, 1995. There was such prerelease hype for Windows 95, an operating system upgrade, that some people bought the software even though they did not yet own a computer on which to run it. No such midnight madness is expected on June 25 when Microsoft, barring a late intervention by Federal or state antitrust officials, releases Windows 98. Although it is the first major upgrade of the company's flagship software in nearly three years, Microsoft refers to Windows 98 a ''fine tuning of Windows 95'' and ''the next major release of Windows 95.''
4/30/1998	13 States Plan Antitrust Move Over Microsoft	Attorneys General from 13 states, apparently intent on blocking the imminent release of the Microsoft Corporation's next version of its Windows software, are in the final stages of preparing a joint antitrust action against the company. ''The decision on our action is imminent, and in my opinion some action is likely,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General. ''I think it will be in the next couple of weeks.''
4/29/1998	MICROSOFT BUYS MESA GROUP TO BOLSTER E-MAIL SOFTWARE	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had bought the closely held Mesa Group Inc., which helps electronic mail users move from I.B.M. software to Microsoft software, in a bid to take corporate E-mail customers from I.B.M. The Boston-based Mesa Group provides software and services to companies wanting to switch from I.B.M.'s Lotus Notes E-mail to Microsoft's Exchange E-mail software. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Mesa's Jumpstart products complement Microsoft's Notes Connector software, which enables companies to use Lotus Notes and Exchange at the same time. Mesa's software lets users move permanently from I.B.M. to Microsoft.
4/27/1998	A shift so fundamental that not even Microsoft may know how to respond.	THE Microsoft Corporation has a longstanding reputation in the personal computer industry as a schoolyard bully. But recent public scrutiny has propelled the company's swaggering reputation into the mainstream. And predicting the software giant's eventual demise has expanded into something of a national parlor game. Even the venerable Silicon Valley research institute, SRI International, which rarely chimes in on the ideological events of the day, is now ''pondering the unthinkable,'' as it says in its speculative report ''After Microsoft'' (http://future.sri.com/bip/AM.html).
4/27/1998	Microsoft Withdraws From Project At University	The Microsoft Corporation has withdrawn from a disputed $300 million project to help the California State University system build a high-speed computer network linking its 22 campuses. The plan, one of the most ambitious partnerships ever forged between the private sector and public education, was proposed last fall as a way to finance new technologies for the financially constrained system, the nation's largest network of universities. The Hughes Electronics Corporation, a unit of General Motors, has also dropped out, leaving GTE and Fujitsu as the remaining private players.
4/27/1998	U.S. Watching Introduction of Windows 98	Federal and state officials are now racing to determine what antitrust action, if any, they should take against the Microsoft Corporation before its next-generation operating system, Windows 98, is shipped to personal computer makers in May and goes on sale in June. But the personal computer industry has been gearing up for Windows 98 far longer than the antitrust authorities. And the early impact of Windows 98 on the marketplace, computer executives and analysts predict, will be only a ripple compared with the tidal wave of its predecessor Windows 95 -- with sales projected at less than half the volume of Windows 95.
4/26/1998	Ideas & Trends: Due Processor; Hey! Computers Go Faster Than the Courts.	EVEN the Justice Department acknowledges that its current antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation may be outdated. In a hearing before a Federal appeals court in Washington last week, Judge Patricia M. Wald asked whether the case was not about to be overrun by time and Microsoft's new products -- or, as she put it, ''lost in a time warp.''
4/24/1998	Of Internet Inequality; Rockefeller and Gates	To the Editor: Re ''Next to Gates, Rockefeller Shines'' (letters, April 22): David S. Feldman and Milton H. Miller both miss an important distinction between John D. Rockfeller's Standard Oil and William H. Gates's Microsoft. Mr. Rockefeller sold a natural resource available to all for the taking, provided you had enough hard capital to drill it, refine it and distribute it.
4/23/1998	Gates's New Face: Red but Cheerful	As the world now knows, Bill Gates's computer crashed spectacularly as he and an associate were demonstrating Microsoft's forthcoming Windows 98 at the Spring Comdex computer exposition this week in Chicago. But that was not the real news. Very few executives in the technology industry have not suffered a similar embarrassment while demonstrating a prerelease, or beta, product in public. The demo gods are cruel. The real news is that Bill Gates laughed it off. ''I guess we still have some bugs to work out,'' he said, chuckling. ''That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.''
4/23/1998	Advertising That's Intended To Bypass Your Hard Drive	In keeping with the new niceness campaign, the walkways at Comdex were festooned with banners carrying inspirational slogans like: ''Windows was not written for computers. Windows was written for people.'' Sure! Just tuck a Windows CD in your pocket and see how much more productive you'll be.
4/23/1998	Microsoft Beats Earnings Expectations, but Revenue Growth Slows	After alerting analysts last month that its third-quarter earnings would exceed Wall Street's expectations, the Microsoft Corporation reported results yesterday that surpassed their revised estimates. But the company's revenue growth slowed to its lowest level since 1996, and Microsoft executives warned that sales would be sequentially flat in the next few quarters.
4/22/1998	Next to Gates, Rockefeller Shines	To the Editor: Re Ron Chernow's ''How to Stay a Titan'' (Op-Ed, April 19): Until the Justice Department acknowledges that Microsoft cannot sell both the operating system (Windows 95 and successor operating systems) and applications (word processors, spread sheets, databases, browsers, accounting programs), its antitrust investigation will not be handled properly. The solution is simple. Microsoft must be broken into two companies: one to develop and sell operating systems, the other to develop and sell applications.
4/22/1998	Next to Gates, Rockefeller Shines	To the Editor: Ron Chernow's comparison of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil and William H. Gates's Microsoft missed two important contrasts (Op-Ed, April 19). First, Standard Oil's kerosene was a better and ultimately cheaper form of energy for illumination than any that existed. Microsoft's operating system and software, however, are not state of the art. Microsoft sells less-than-fully-featured software so that it can sell updates -- a de facto licensing fee.
4/22/1998	Microsoft Browser Case Has Day in Court	At a Federal appeals court hearing today, the Microsoft Corporation and the Justice Department faced tough questions but got no clear indication on how the judges might rule on the company's effort to overturn an order against Microsoft in the Government's antitrust case against it. Today's hearing was an appeal in the Justice Department suit accusing Microsoft of violating a 1995 consent decree by forcing computer manufacturers to accept the company's Internet browsing software as a condition of licensing its Windows 95 operating system. Microsoft is appealing a judge's preliminary injunction last December requiring it to sell computer makers a version of its Windows 95 that does not include the browsing capabilities.
4/21/1998	Small Browser Concession From Microsoft	On the eve of a courtroom confrontation with the Justice Department, the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would give personal computer makers an option on the first screen they present to computer users. The issue of Microsoft's control of what people see when they turn on their computers -- through its near-monopoly of the market for personal computer operating system software -- has come under increasing scrutiny recently from the Government and become the subject of increasing criticism within the industry.
4/20/1998	In software development, a true ardor for Java.	WATCHING Sun Microsystems and the Microsoft Corporation quarrel over Java is a little like watching kids decide some issue by doing one-up with a baseball bat, hand over hand, until the winner cups the top of the handle. So it goes in the software business. With Windows, Microsoft has a choke-hold on the personal computer operating system, so Sun has been attempting to go one-up by creating a new playing field with the Java programming language. First created by Sun researchers as an experimental programming language in the early 1990's, Java has emerged as Sun's candidate for a universal communications medium. By persuading programmers to write for Java instead of for Windows, Sun hoped to steal Microsoft's influence.
4/19/1998	How to Stay a Titan	On May 15, 1911, in a soft voice that belied the supreme drama of the moment, Chief Justice Edward White read aloud a 20,000-word opinion, ordering the breakup of Standard Oil for violating the antitrust laws. Thus ended a morality play that had riveted America for five years, ever since Teddy Roosevelt's trustbusters decided to teach the trust and its founder, John D. Rockefeller, a lesson in corporate citizenship. Amid the current wave of corporate mergers, the specter of Standard Oil now hovers over a swelling antitrust debate. On Tuesday, the appeals hearing in the Justice Department's antitrust probe of Microsoft is scheduled to begin. Many critics have noted the often eerie parallels between Rockefeller and Bill Gates.
4/17/1998	How Microsoft Is Like Big Tobacco; Monopoly on Genius?	To the Editor: Frank Rich (column, April 15) is right: Microsoft's behavior is indeed arrogant. Microsoft's product took no more or less genius to develop than did the standard typewriter keyboard. The company understands this, but so far the public does not.
4/17/1998	How Microsoft Is Like Big Tobacco	To the Editor: Frank Rich (column, April 15) says Microsoft ''is taking a new P.R. leaf directly from the playbook'' of Big Tobacco by orchestrating a ''stealth media blitz'' of opinion articles favorable to Microsoft. But phony grass-roots campaigns only begin to illustrate the similarity between Microsoft and Big Tobacco. More fundamentally, Microsoft and the tobacco companies deny customers choice.

4/17/1998	How Microsoft Is Like Big Tobacco; Lack of Choice	To the Editor: Frank Rich's April 15 column on the similarity between Microsoft and Big Tobacco seems to miss one point. While people have a choice about whether to smoke or not, I have not been able to find a computing system without the bug-filled Windows operating system. It may not matter when running games, but trying to make a living while constantly losing material because of ''illegal operation -- shut down'' is a bummer. GERSIL N.

4/16/1998	Microsoft May Solicit 'Spontaneous' Support	The Microsoft Corporation, facing antitrust investigations by a dozen states' attorneys general as well as by the Federal Government, is planning a public relations blitz intended, in a phrase taken from a confidential memo, to ''provide media air cover for a state public affairs campaign,'' The Los Angeles Times has reported.
4/16/1998	Soaring at 4,500 Feet, Steps From the Fridge	THE altimeter shows 4,500 feet as my single-engine plane drones on through the gathering dusk over Connecticut. The radio is silent, the only noise the steady thrum-thrum-thrum of the propeller. I'm edgy about my fuel level, about crossing the Long Island Sound in blackness, about picking out Republic Airport's feeble beacon from the radiant clutter of suburban Long Island. Should I descend through the darkening hills to refuel at Danbury, Conn., or press on? Instead, I hit ''pause,'' get up from my desk and head to the kitchen for a sandwich.
4/15/1998	Journal; Up in Smoke	The antic appearances as a TV pitchman for Big Bertha golf clubs didn't charm. The sober photo ops in inner-city classrooms didn't impress.

4/14/1998	Windows 98? Microsoft Set To Start Sales On June 25	The Microsoft Corporation will announce on Tuesday that it will begin selling the long-awaited version of its Windows 98 operating system on June 25. Microsoft will charge $109, but it said most retailers would sell the new program for $89 to $100. Microsoft also said that some computer makers would include coupons offering free upgrades for computers bought after April 1.

4/11/1998	Microsoft-Intel Television Effort	The Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation said this week that they would work jointly on technology for interactive television, as the companies try to increase their roles in home entertainment. Microsoft said it would start the partnership by licensing Intel's Intercast technology, which allows viewers to watch interactive broadcasts, and include it in Windows 98, the computer operating system it plans to offer later this year.
4/10/1998	Microsoft Joins Debate Over On-Line Privacy by Acquiring Firefly	The Microsoft Corporation's purchase of a tiny software developer, Firefly Network Inc., generated barely a ripple on Wall Street when it was announced today. But the deal highlights a debate on privacy over Firefly's technology, which allows computer users to control more of their personal information on the Internet. While some privacy advocates see the Firefly software as greater protection, others warn that if Microsoft integrates the software into its World Wide Web browser, as expected, it will make the gathering of vast quantities of information about individuals part of the fabric of the Internet.
4/10/1998	U.S. and Microsoft to Talk Before Possible Showdown	The Justice Department's top antitrust official is scheduled to meet with the Microsoft Corporation's general counsel in Washington today in what both sides are portraying as an effort to find common ground instead of going to court again. But the meeting also promises to be a high-stakes hand in the antitrust poker game being played by the Government and Microsoft. The Justice Department must be ready to bring a new antitrust case against Microsoft, even if it chooses not to, if it is to force the software maker to alter practices that it thinks restrict competition and threaten innovation. And Microsoft must be prepared to call the Government's bluff and take its chances in court.
4/9/1998	Microsoft Pushes Case in Ads	In an effort to win public support as its antitrust battle with the Government intensifies, the Microsoft Corporation will begin running quarter-page advertisements today stating its case in five newspapers. The first ad contends that Microsoft's ability to integrate new features into its software is beneficial to the nation's well-being. The ad is running in The Seattle Times, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The Washington Post and The Washington Times, and appears today in The New York Times on page A16.
4/9/1998	Windows 95 Is Hanging On Even as Windows 98 Nears	With Windows 98 set to arrive in late June, one would think that sales of Windows 95 would trickle to a halt between now and then unless Microsoft offered some sort of coupon or rebate. Not so. Microsoft is continuing to sell thousands of copies of the upgrade kit for Windows 95 (about $89) and the Windows 95 new user package (about $175) each month, according to software tracking services.
4/7/1998	Plans Offered To Cut Power Of Microsoft	Concerned computer industry executives have approached the Justice Department with a wide-ranging set of 10 proposed remedies that they believe would help rein in the monopoly power of the Microsoft Corporation. The proposals, which are contained in a document that is circulating among industry executives, include forcing Microsoft to separate its applications businesses from its operating system business and establishing a monitoring system to track Microsoft's business practices.
4/6/1998	Harm Found To the Image Of Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation's bitter legal clash with the Justice Department has begun to hurt the software publisher's brand reputation among business customers and consumers, according to a research organization that tracks brand recognition of technology companies. The research company, Techtel Inc., collects data that are widely used in the high-technology industry to assess marketing effectiveness and manage product demand. It has found that negative opinion about Microsoft has increased measurably among the 900 people who serve as a panel of respondents surveyed by Techtel each quarter. The panelists are chosen to represent a broad range of company sizes, business users and consumer households.
4/6/1998	Ready or Not, Here Comes HDTV; But the Industry's Vision Is Still Far From Focused	In a darkened hearing room on the second floor of the Rayburn House Office Building on Tuesday, NBC and the Lin Television Corporation, which owns 13 TV stations, were staging a demonstration of high-definition television -- the live broadcast of a Texas Rangers-Chicago White Sox baseball game -- for an eager, milling crowd of legislators, lobbyists and others. ''This is not only the opening game for baseball but opening day for digital television,'' Gregory Schmidt, a Lin vice president, declared as his audience gathered around three prototype HDTV sets displaying crystal-clear images of the ball park in Arlington, Tex. ''We wanted everyone to see the full benefits of true high-definition television.''
4/2/1998	On the Job, Freedom at a Price; A New Feudal System	To the Editor: Your article on the plight of ''permatemps'' at Microsoft (Business Day, March 30) failed to mention Microsoft's role in the passage of a new Washington State regulation exempting companies from paying certain highly skilled computer professionals time and a half for overtime work. Such changes in labor regulations indicate the rise of a new feudal state in which workers are no longer included in decisions about their pay, because, they are told, ''what is good for Microsoft and Boeing is good for you.''
4/2/1998	Gates Describes the Road Ahead as Noisy	IMAGINE an office or school where all the people are talking to their computers at the same time. That is the future enunciated last week by Bill Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, at the annual Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in Florida. At the Winhec keynote session, Mr. Gates told hundreds of the world's top computer engineers and developers that Microsoft had begun developing a consumer version of its Windows NT operating system, which is intended to replace Windows 98 in a few years. Mr. Gates said he believed that the voice, not fingers tapping on a keyboard or a mouse, might eventually become the primary user interface for computers.
4/2/1998	Adding Software Can Add Trouble	PROGRAMMERS are often good wordsmiths, and one of the better terms floating around today is bit rot: what happens when software that once worked well fails unexpectedly. The problem often leads many people to avoid expanding their systems or installing new software because they are afraid that old but important programs will stop working. The term is not literally accurate. The bits that make up a program do not actually change or decompose; they stay exactly the same. The changes crop up in the operating system or in supporting software that does not behave the same way when a new version emerges. An old program may count upon some behavior from an operating system and find that the new version of the system does not deliver it.
4/2/1998	On the Job, Freedom at a Price	To the Editor: Re ''Equal Work, Less-Equal Perks'' (Business Day, March 30): The complaints of Microsoft's temporary employees about having fewer benefits than permanent employees raised my ire. I was a contractor with the Jet Propulsion Laboratories in Pasadena, Calif., for five years. I made a conscious choice: I traded reduced benefits for a higher salary and the ability to remain on the technical track rather than management.
4/2/1998	On the Job, Freedom at a Price	To the Editor: As a freelance editor, I read your article on Microsoft's temporary employees (Business Day, March 30) with much personal interest. Companies find contract workers useful and profitable, and our numbers will continue to grow as technology enables us to do more tasks off-site. Most of us are contributing to the economy in a significant way and taking virtually nothing from it -- no paid sick or personal time, no health care coverage, no retirement benefits, no stock options and no help with Social Security taxes.
3/30/1998	U.S. Facing Lightning Technology Shifts in Microsoft Case	In its pursuit of the Microsoft Corporation, the Justice Department is breathing hard -- just to keep up, let alone catch the company red-handed with the kind of evidence it needs to bring a broader antitrust case. Under Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, the Justice Department has assembled a formidable team of antitrust litigators and policy experts. But it faces an extraordinary challenge in keeping its investigation in step with the fast-changing Internet software market and Microsoft's quickly shifting tactics.
3/30/1998	Equal Work, Less-Equal Perks; Microsoft Leads the Way in Filling Jobs With 'Permatemps'	They hold high-prestige, high-technology jobs at Microsoft's plush campus. They often do the same work as the Microsoft Corporation's permanent employees, developing CD-ROM's, designing World Wide Web sites and writing software manuals. Yet they do not qualify for Microsoft's coveted stock options, and their health and vacation benefits are pale imitations of those enjoyed by regular Microsoft workers. They are long-term temps -- a seeming oxymoron, but in fact a new and growing phenomenon in the American work force, embraced by many corporations, especially high-tech ones, including Microsoft, AT&T, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft's Seattle neighbor, Boeing.
3/30/1998	For $19.95, Slate Sees Who Its Friends Are	It is a clear, shining day in Washington, a world away from the Seattle rain. The budding cherry blossoms hint at spring. And Michael Kinsley, the editor and creator of Microsoft's on-line magazine Slate, is pacing the bare parquet floors of a one-bedroom apartment, considering whether to rent it. Mr. Kinsley has been feeling out of touch with the buzz of the Beltway these days and, perhaps to reconnect, he has agreed to occasionally return to his chair on CNN's ''Crossfire,'' where he became a celebrity liberal for butting heads with the conservative Pat Buchanan.
3/27/1998	Senators Ask Microsoft to Ease Data Release	In a sign of increasing Congressional scrutiny of the Microsoft Corporation, the Senate Judicary Committee formally asked it yesterday to allow business partners to provide information to the committee without notifying the software maker. The Judiciary Committee made the request in a letter signed by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, the chairman, and three other committee members.
3/25/1998	Microsoft Expects to Beat Earnings Targets	With its sales continuing to power ahead, the Microsoft Corporation announced late yesterday that its profits in the current quarter would exceed Wall Street's forecast by about 9 percent. But Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, tried to temper expectations for the future, saying that ''growth is slowing.''
3/22/1998	AIDING CONSUMERS IS NOW THE THRUST OF ANTITRUST PUSH	When the Government challenged the proposed mergers of the nation's four largest drug wholesalers earlier this month, the pronouncements from the Federal Trade Commission did not follow the script that trustbusters used for much of the last century, decrying the power of big, monopolistic businesses. No, the Government's chief complaint was that the mergers might raise the prices consumers pay for drugs by even as much as 1 percent.
3/19/1998	As Big as Microsoft: Ribbing Gates	CALL them Gates gags: the digitized barbs flung playfully across cyberspace at the expense of the billionaire computer icon Bill Gates and the ubiquitous goods of his software company, Microsoft. Or call them tasteless examples of sour grapes, these jokes popping up on countless computers at the expense of William H. Gates, a great American entrepreneur whose Windows handiwork runs most of the computers on the planet. Whatever you call them, mockery of Mr. Gates and the Microsoft Corporation is flourishing in E-mail exchanges, on the World Wide Web and on commercially available CD-ROM's.
3/19/1998	Debut of Windows 98 Is Moved to Summer	AFTER several delays, the Microsoft Corporation last week announced that Windows 98 would be available in retail stores on June 25. Code-named Memphis, the new software -- the first major upgrade to Windows 95 in nearly three years -- was first scheduled to appear in 1997, but it was renamed Windows 98 when the shipping date moved to January. That slipped to April or May, and now to June. Part of the reason for the Windows 98 delays, one can assume, is the time Microsoft has spent arguing with the Justice Department about the integration of the Internet Explorer Web browser with the Windows 95 operating system. Windows 98 will come with an even more tightly integrated Explorer browser, although Microsoft contends that the issue is moot because, it says, the Windows 98 Explorer is no longer technically a browser.
3/18/1998	SUN MICROSYSTEMS TO PROVIDE DATA IN MICROSOFT INQUIRY	Sun Microsystems Inc., enmeshed in a court battle over its Java software language with the Microsoft Corporation, has been asked to provide information to the Justice Department in a continuing antitrust investigation of Microsoft's business practices. A spokeswoman, Anne Little, confirmed yesterday that Sun, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., had received various civil subpoenas from the Justice Department ''several months ago'' as well as from some states that are conducting their own inquiries into Microsoft.
3/16/1998	The vision of General Magic buttressed by Microsoft. Now that's an interface!	WHEN the Microsoft Corporation announced earlier this month that it had bought a minority stake in the financially struggling General Magic Inc., the investment refocused the industry's attention on one of Silicon Valley's most acutely visionary companies -- and one that had over the years become synonymous with high-technology hubris. General Magic, founded in 1990, is largely responsible for firmly planting a powerful and largely correct vision in the popular consciousness about a coming revolution in electronic communication.
3/16/1998	Updates: Media and Technology; Critiques of Microsoft (With a Wink to Pogo)	Competition and innovation go hand in hand. It is one of life's truisms, accepted in economic circles, enshrined in antitrust doctrine. And recently, the competition-innovation link has become a central tenet of the critique of Microsoft -- that the company is a monopolist that stifles competition and thus innovation. But a new study of competition and innovation in the computer software industry raises questions about the linkage, though the research provides ammunition for both the Microsoft Corporation's defenders and its detractors.
3/14/1998	Sega Enterprises Pulls Its Saturn Video Console From the U.S. Market	In a stunning retreat, Sega Enterprises Ltd., the company that gave wings to the high-flying video-game business with the success of its Sega Genesis console, announced today that it was pulling its Sega Saturn console from the United States market in the face of stiff competition from Sony and Nintendo. The company said it would write off $450 million to cover losses at its United States subsidiary, Sega of America Inc., and on investment securities and a software venture, as well as for the disposal of inventory. Sega expects to post a consolidated net loss for the year ending March 31 of 32.8 billion yen, or $254 million, and anticipates that sales will fall almost 21 percent, to $2.8 billion. Its stock sank 3.3 percent today to close at 2,130 yen.
3/14/1998	WARNER BOOKS AND GATES REACH A TENTATIVE BOOK DEAL	William H. Gates, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, has reached a tentative agreement with Warner Books, part of Time Warner Inc., to publish his second book, which will focus on how the Microsoft Corporation applies its technology to running its business. Microsoft executives said yesterday that Mr. Gates had an agreement in principle with Time Warner, but said that a final contract had not yet been signed. The new book, which does not yet have a title or a publication date, is intended to reach the company's millions of business customers -- in contrast with his first book, ''The Road Ahead,'' which was aimed at general readers. Mr. Gates originally proposed the idea of showing how personal computing technology could be used to make businesses work more effectively early last year. The roots of the project lay in Mr. Gates's eagerness to reach a broad business audience with his understanding of how the Internet was changing business, said Collins Hemingway, a Microsoft marketing executive.
3/13/1998	Aiming for Business Readers This Time, Gates Plans 2d Book	William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, intends to write a new book in an effort to showcase his talents as a technologist and burnish an image tarnished by a Government lawsuit charging his company with monopolistic practices. Unlike ''The Road Ahead'' (Viking, 1995), which was aimed at general readers, the new book is intended to reach the company's millions of business customers, publishing industry people who have seen the proposal say. It will reportedly portray Mr. Gates as an innovator who built a company that changed the way the world does business.
3/12/1998	In Northwest, Computer Security Is a Private-Public Effort	IT has no office, no officers, no Web site, no stationery and not even a phone number. It has ''security by obscurity'' and an unusual role in protecting the integrity of networks, databases and computers in public and private offices throughout the Pacific Northwest. Agora, based in Seattle, is an association of more than 300 people who work for about 100 companies and at least 45 government agencies, including Microsoft and the Mounties, Blue Shield and the Secret Service. The group -- its name is Greek for marketplace, a place for people to meet and discuss local news -- has been working quietly to help computer experts share ways to stump cybercrooks in the Northwest.
3/11/1998	Justice Department Names 'Point Man' on Microsoft Case	The Justice Department has hired Jeffrey Blattner, a former chief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as special counsel for information technology, a sign that the department's confrontation with Microsoft may be escalating. Mr. Blattner, 43, whose appointment is expected to be announced today, will serve as the ''point man inside Justice on the Microsoft case,'' a Justice Department official said yesterday.
3/11/1998	Government Paved Way for Microsoft's Success	To the Editor: William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, made the usual monopolist's argument for free market capitalism before the Senate Judiciary Committee (editorial, March 4), but he didn't mention the important role that Government played in creating the technology that made him the country's richest man. All of the technologies that Microsoft is exploiting, or plans to exploit, were developed with Government financing: the Internet, World Wide Web, graphics interfaces and so on.
3/11/1998	Government Paved Way for Microsoft's Success; Consumers Suffer	To the Editor: Edward Tenner (Op-Ed, March 8) says that ''Microsoft's operating system and other programs are outstanding not for visionary elegance but for the freedom they give us to customize, modify and tinker.'' He seems to think that buying a computer operating system is like buying a phone. But we never worry that any of the phones we might choose won't work in our homes. Choosing an operating system or word processor is not like buying a phone. Rather, it's like buying a cola at a baseball game. Pepsi owns the contract for the stadium I go to, so I can't buy a Coke. I can choose to root for another team and go to another stadium, or I can learn to like Pepsi.
3/11/1998	Government Paved Way for Microsoft's Success; Robber-Baron Image	To the Editor: Frank Rich's March 7 column about the public relations makeover of William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, quotes a biographer of John D. Rockefeller: ''The aim of turn-of-the-century moguls was not to get good press but no press at all. They had absolutely no interest in being seen as regular guys.'' Actually, in their later years many of the robber barons took steps to improve their images. In 1913 Rockefeller hired Ivy Lee, a public relations pioneer. Lee came up with the idea that the billionaire should carry a roll of dimes and give them, one at a time, to children who crossed his path. This idea came too late to help save Standard Oil's monopoly, which was broken up in 1911, but it did wonders for Rockefeller's popularity.
3/11/1998	Government Paved Way for Microsoft's Success; Tools That We Need	To the Editor: Re ''Mr. Gates Takes the Stand'' (editorial, March 4): I run a small company heavily dependent on desk-top computers and a few key software applications. Over a 10-year period we've used both Sun Microsystem's Unix computers and PC's with Microsoft's Windows NT. Last year Microsoft won the battle in our shop: the last Unix computer was replaced with another Windows NT system.
3/11/1998	Microsoft Adding to Java and to Sun Rift	The Microsoft Corporation plans to announce new capabilities Wednesday for its version of the Java programming language that are certain to deepen a bitter rift with Sun Microsystems Inc., Java's inventor. Microsoft executives said today that they were departing further from the standard that Sun refers to as ''100 percent pure Java'' in an effort to give software programmers better performance and increased compatibility with Microsoft's Windows operating systems features.
3/9/1998	Notes From the Hearing Room	Last week, the Microsoft Corporations's founder and chief executive, William H. Gates, went to Congress to testify about his company's business practices. In the course of a hearing that lasted almost five hours, Mr. Gates refused to accept the suggestion posed by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin G. Hatch, that Microsoft's domination in the market for computer operating systems constitutes a monopoly.
3/9/1998	A New Palm Pilot By 3Com Today	The 3Com Corporation plans to introduce an enhanced version of its Palm Pilot hand-held electronic organizer today as it prepares for Microsoft's entry into the market for such devices later this year. Current versions of the Palm Pilot, priced from $250 to $370, have become information-age fashion accessories. The new Palm III, which will be available in April, is to cost $399.
3/9/1998	Refusing to Say the M-Word	William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, was rhetorically bobbing and weaving in the face of the combative questioning of the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin G. Hatch, at last Tuesday's committee hearings. The steely Republican from Utah kept trying to pin the software entrepreneur down, repeatedly, on just one word. Mr. Gates doggedly resisted. He went on at length saying that his company's products are short-lived, that the software industry is brutally competitive and that Microsoft's only lasting advantage is the ingenuity of its engineers. In four hours before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Gates successfully avoided ever mentioning the M-word: monopoly.
3/8/1998	The Microsoft We Deserve	The world's strongest government is fighting its most formidable corporation in a spectacle enthralling to a citizenry unaccustomed to such superpower confrontations. We have mixed feelings about Federal might and private hegemony. We sense that the Justice Department's lawsuit against Microsoft is serious indeed, yet we also aren't so sure which side to root for.
3/7/1998	Journal; Love That Bill	This side of Hollywood no one has done more to further America's modern cult of celebrity than the house that Luce built: Time, Life, People. And so it only followed that at the 75th anniversary bash for Time at Radio City this week, fame, not goodness, determined the guest list: Joe DiMaggio and Louis Farrakhan, Anita Hill and Imelda Marcos, Mel Brooks and the actual Nazi propagandist he evoked in ''Springtime for Hitler,'' Leni Riefenstahl. Celebrity uber alles, indeed: as in Luce journalism, star-sized personalities guaranteed entree more than intellectual or moral attainment. Among the throng no celeb seemed more a virgin to the game than Bill Gates, who in the gala's Ed Sullivanesque lineup was the bridge between an impenetrable address by Mikhail Gorbachev and Mary Tyler Moore's tribute to Lucille Ball. Mr. Gates chose to salute the Wright Brothers as his heroes of Luce's American Century, but when he talked of ''two obscure, fresh-faced'' inventors who aspired to bring ''people closer together,'' he seemed to be doing spin for himself and Paul Allen, the geeks who gave the world kindly Microsoft. The Government didn't intrude on Wilbur and Orville, the subtext all but screamed, so why now target Bill, as Orrin Hatch had in the Senate earlier that day?
3/6/1998	Bill Gates is Tiger Woods? Well, he's doing a commercial.	BILL GATES, you've just testified before a Senate committee, paid tribute to the Wright brothers at the Time magazine 75th anniversary party, presented the New York Public Library with a $640,000 grant and visited a sixth-grade classroom. What are you going to do? No, William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, is not going to Disney World. Instead, he is taking another prominent role in the consumer-celebrity culture: that of pitchman.
3/5/1998	Virtual Unreality at Urban School; Gates Goes to a Carefully Prepared 6th-Grade Classroom	A day after he was hauled before a United States Senate panel and all but accused of plotting to take over the world, the country's richest man had to settle yesterday for commandeering a sixth-grade classroom at a middle school in Washington Heights. Forgive the students if they didn't exactly recognize their surroundings after he had temporarily redecorated the place.
3/5/1998	Noticed and Now Net-Savvy	WWW.SLATE.COM THROUGH Michael Kinsley, its high-profile Eastern-establishment-meets-technology editor, Microsoft's Slate has probably gained the most visibility of the large Web publications. Slate has also gained the most business-press ink for its various off-again, on-again subscription schemes. (It is on again; next week, Slate will begin charging a fee that will limit access to the site to paying customers.)
3/5/1998	Microsoft, Accused of Trademark Violations, Is Sued in Europe	In a lawsuit that raises new questions about the Microsoft Corporation's market power, Palm Computing Inc., a pioneering Silicon Valley maker of a hand-held electronic organizer called the Palm Pilot, is suing Microsoft in Europe, accusing it of trademark violations. The dispute arose as a result of Microsoft's decision late last year to enter the market for shirt-pocket-sized computers with a new version of its Windows CE operating system that it named the Palm PC. The new Microsoft-based machines borrow a number of the Palm Pilot's features and like it they will operate with a stylus. They are to be manufactured and distributed by a number of consumer electronics manufacturers. Palm Computing is a division of the 3Com Corporation.
3/5/1998	Corrections	An article and a picture caption in Business Day yesterday about an appearance by William H. Gates before a Senate hearing referred incorrectly to comments by James L. Barksdale, president of the Netscape Communications Corporation. In calling for a show of hands to demonstrate that Microsoft had a monopoly, he asked how many of those with personal computers used Microsoft's Windows operating system -- not the company's Web software, Microsoft Explorer.
3/4/1998	An 'Icon of Technology' Encounters Some Rude Political Realities	William H. Gates walked into the Senate hearing room today flanked by his two home state Senators, Slade Gorton and Patty Murray of Washington, like a couple of bodyguards ready to ward off the blows. Mr. Gates arrived in town Monday to lay the groundwork, shake hands, answer questions and play the political game he had been accused of ignoring for way too long. But in a few short hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Gates saw his spruced-up image sputter all over again.
3/4/1998	Gates, on Capitol Hill, Presents Case for an Unfettered Microsoft	In his first testimony before Congress, William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, delivered a spirited defense of his company's business practices today and portrayed Microsoft as the standard- bearer of the nation's high-technology economy. In listing his industry's achievements, Mr. Gates boasted that software makers had created more than two million American jobs, had contributed $100 billion to the economy last year and had generated technological change at an awesome rate.
3/4/1998	Mr. Gates Takes the Stand	Bill Gates's appearance yesterday before the Senate Judiciary Committee lacked the drama early in the century, when Congress hauled in J. P. Morgan to defend Wall Street's frightening reach into the sinews of the economy. Yesterday's hearings also lacked the impact of turn-of-the-century investigations of Standard Oil's manipulative stranglehold -- an inquiry that informed later antitrust law and court doctrines. Even so, it was a moment of no small importance -- the first confrontation between the information age's wealthiest and most gifted entrepreneur and a Congress that is trying to figure out whether Mr. Gates is the consumer's best friend or a crafty monopolist determined to crush all competitors. Diplomatically polite to his senatorial hosts, Mr. Gates nevertheless gave little ground on matters of substance, and offered some dubious new twists on standard economic terms. Despite Microsoft's 90 percent share of the market for operating systems, he said, the company could not be called a monopoly because its chokehold might disappear tomorrow. He insisted that his contracts with equipment manufacturers and Internet service providers did not prohibit their customers from buying rival software. But he failed to point out that some of those contracts placed high hurdles between customers and non-Microsoft products.
3/3/1998	Microsoft Offers To Change Deals	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had offered to revise business deals with about 40 Internet service providers in the United States and Europe but denied the move was a reaction to continuing United States and European Union investigations into its business practices. A Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed a report in The Washington Post that the company had offered to amend business agreement language so that service providers in contracts with Microsoft would be allowed to promote Internet browsing software from rival concerns.
3/2/1998	Spyglass, a Pioneer, Learns Hard Lessons About Microsoft	Few people are more familiar with the real-world nature of Microsoft's market power than Douglas P. Colbeth, the 42-year-old chief executive of Spyglass Inc. His Internet software company has been a supplier to Microsoft, providing the software engine for its Internet Explorer browser. Spyglass has also been a Microsoft competitor, briefly, in the browser market. Both roles proved to be sobering for Spyglass. So much so that the company's current strategy is mainly to stay out of Microsoft's path, finding specialized markets for Internet software and services that the software giant ignores.
3/2/1998	Microsoft's Defense Is in Its Software Code	To the uninitiated, the clash between the Microsoft Corporation and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division can seem a maddening exercise in semantics. The antitrust lawyers say Microsoft's Internet Explorer program for browsing the World Wide Web is a stand-alone product. Microsoft says that an operating system enhanced with browser software is still an operating system. The Justice Department argues that Microsoft uses its dominance in the operating system market to gain unfair advantage over rivals in other markets. Microsoft argues that it is making better products for consumers.
3/2/1998	Under the Hood	The Justice Department is seeking to prevent Microsoft from making computer manufacturers load Internet Explorer in new machines. Microsoft says, however, that without Explorer, its Windows 95 operating system and features of other software will not work. The reason: when Microsoft upgraded Internet Explorer to version 3.0, it placed some of the program's improved code into files that also contained instructions for operating system functions like drawing windows on screen.

More than 50 public and private schools nationwide take part in Learning With Laptops, Microsoft-Toshiba venture started three years ago, which arranges computer service and lease agreements for schools; most Learning With Laptops schools market program to parents, who receive slightly discounted three-year lease at roughly $58 a month for basic laptop package; some schools split lease payments evenly with students' families; chairman of Texas Board of Education received favorable reviews from some state legislators on his proposal to divert textbook funds toward purchase of laptops (M)

2/23/1998	TV Cable Box Software May Blur Digital Signals	For more than a year, the Microsoft Corporation has been cajoling the nation's television broadcasters into abandoning high-definition television and using only the computer industry's favored, lower-resolution transmission formats when digital broadcasts begin in the fall. By and large, broadcasters have rejected these entreaties. Now, however, Microsoft appears to have gained at least a small foothold for its proposal through a little-noticed feature of the company's agreement to supply the operating system for several million digital cable boxes being purchased by Tele-Communications Inc. And that has angered broadcasters, television set makers, Government officials and others.
2/18/1998	A Judge in Texas Rules in Favor of Microsoft	A Texas judge ruled today that the Microsoft Corporation did not hinder a state investigation into its business practices by requiring partners to notify the software maker before complying with the state's demand for information. Judge Joe Hart of State District Court denied the Texas Attorney General office's request for a permanent injunction that would have prohibited Microsoft from enforcing the so-called nondisclosure agreements. He dismissed the state's suit, saying it had ''offered nothing more than speculation'' about any possible harm the agreements had caused the investigation.
2/18/1998	Business Travel; Microsoft is moving into the business of supplying fast Internet access for hotel guests.	AT last, Seattle -- a city in Microsoft's backyard -- has a hotel with a bit of dazzling computer technology. It's the Vintage Park, which in a deal with the Redmond, Wash., software giant has outfitted 30 of its rooms and suites with computers, Microsoft Office Suite software and digital T-1 lines that can provide access to E-mail and the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than a dial-up modem. The hotel, managed by San Francisco-based Kimpton Hotels and Restaurant Group, is not charging extra for the service. But Microsoft, never one to miss a sale, has additional software for purchase through the concierge.
2/18/1998	U S West to Ask F.C.C. Permission to Build Big Data Network	The U S West Communications Group plans to ask Federal regulators for permission to build a big new data network, executives close to the company said yesterday, joining a new attack on rules that keep the Bell local telephone companies out of the $80 billion long-distance market. U S West, which provides local telephone service in 14 Western states, intends to file such a petition with the Federal Communications Commission within a week, the executives said.
2/15/1998	Gentlemen, Choose Your Sausage	IT'S not funny. Really. While in Brussels earlier this month for a meeting, Bill Gates, the Microsoft mogul, was nailed with a good old vaudevillian custard pie in the face. Cameras caught him awkwardly wiping goo from his hair and glasses.
2/15/1998	Here's How The Chiefs Stock Up	WHILE keeping up with the Joneses is a middle-class tradition, catching up with the Gateses has become the game for chief executives, whose 1997 pay and company stock holdings will be disclosed in the weeks ahead as companies mail their annual reports. Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm in Manhattan, analyzed stock and stock options of chief executives at 200 of the largest publicly traded companies. The firm tossed out the top 10 and bottom 10 wealth holders and found that the remaining 180 chiefs had an average of $57.8 million in their company's equity on the last day of 1997. That includes shares owned outright or in tax-deferred accounts and options, both those that can be cashed in and those not yet vested.
2/15/1998	The Nation: The Antitrust Dilemma; Smokestack Doctrine, Digital Age	TO the digitally fluent of Silicon Valley, the heartland of America's high-tech economy, the Government's antitrust battle with the Microsoft Corporation has become known, half-jokingly, as ''our O. J. trial''-- a high-profile, high-stakes case whose outcome will surely be divisive, whether for or against Microsoft. The Microsoft case, then, seems destined to fit neatly into the rich tradition of national ambivalence about the doctrine of antitrust. For more than a century, the antitrust laws have been an uneasy compromise between two American values, populism and capitalism.
2/9/1998	Microsoft Case May Be Prelude to a Wider Antitrust Battle	The first round of the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust confrontation with the Government still has months to run, awaiting Federal court decisions. But a second round has already begun -- the discussion, debate and negotiations about whether the Justice Department should file a broader Sherman Act case against Microsoft. A sweeping case against Microsoft would be a landmark test of how the smokestack-era doctrine of antitrust applies to a high-technology industry. It would also likely be a lengthy, bitter courtroom battle and a step-by-step dissection of the business practices of the software powerhouse that dominates the personal computer industry.
2/6/1998	INSIDE ART	A Sculpture For Microsoft In the tradition of the I.B.M. founder Thomas J. Watson Sr., one of the first executives to grasp the image value of putting art on his office walls, the Microsoft Corporation has spent the last 10 years assembling a collection of prints, photographs and drawings that adorn the lobbies, atriums, cafeterias and halls of its 50 buildings. The collection -- about 2,200 objects so far -- has been chosen by a committee representing a cross-section of employees, from the panel's leader, William Neukom, Microsoft's head of legal and corporate affairs, to technical writers, hardware designers and marketing experts.
2/6/1998	Microsoft Shifts Web Unit to Windows Group	In a quiet reorganization that is certain to raise eyebrows in light of the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust battle with the United States Government, the software giant today moved the group that develops its Internet Explorer World Wide Web browser into the business unit that develops and markets its Windows operating system. The issue of whether Internet Explorer is a separate application or an integrated part of Windows 95 is at the heart of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department charging that Microsoft violated a 1994 antitrust agreement.
2/2/1998	Netscape's decision to give away code could alter the software industry.	RATHER than escalating a dead man's curve race against its archenemy, the Microsoft Corporation, the Netscape Communications Corporation has made a course correction that may profoundly affect the commercial software industry. On Jan. 23, Netscape announced that by the end of the first quarter of this year, it would begin giving away the source code of its popular Communicator suite of Internet software products, including its Navigator World Wide Web browser.
2/2/1998	Updates/Media and Technology; Microsoft Will Soon Offer Peek at New-Media Strategy	The Microsoft Corporation is about to give an invitation-only crowd of 40,000 a glimpse of the company's new-media strategy. This week, the company will begin sending out invitations to on-line samplers of a new World Wide Web site called Microsoft Start, according to industry analysts who have been briefed by the company.
2/2/1998	Updates/Media and Technology; Maker of I.B.M. Clones Teams With Microsoft	The Amdahl Corporation, the maker of clones of I.B.M.'s biggest mainframe computers, plans to announce a wide-ranging partnership with Microsoft to help sell Windows NT to large corporations, said David Wright, the chief executive of Amdahl, which is now a unit of Fujitsu Ltd. For the last few years, no goal has been more important to the Microsoft Corporation than building up its Windows NT operating system so it can handle tasks now assigned to I.B.M. mainframe computers and minicomputers that run the Unix operating system.
2/2/1998	Sun Microsystems sponsors a hearts and minds campaign that may be aimed at Microsoft.	THE battle for the hearts and minds of techno-geeks has taken on the flavor of a political campaign in new advertising for Sun Microsystems Inc. Sun has painted cryptic slogans that seem to attack the Microsoft Corporation -- though not by name -- on the sides of buildings in big cities around the country. The ads will appear soon on the tops of buses in New York and the sides of garbage trucks in San Francisco and also perhaps New York.
1/28/1998	Gates Goes on the Offensive During Silicon Valley Visit	After appearing to be making an effort to soften the company's rhetoric in recent weeks, Microsoft's chairman William H. Gates went back on the offensive during a visit to Silicon Valley today, saying repeatedly that he would not accept restrictions on his ability to add features to Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. He insisted that he had no intention of defying the United States Government, but said the Microsoft Corporation would stand by its principles as a technology innovator.
1/26/1998	Perfecting His Word; Corel's Feisty Founder Promises the Company Will Rebound	Michael C. J. Cowpland beams, tanned and confident, despite the nasty things people are saying about him. Investors have abandoned his software company, the Corel Corporation, and blame him for Corel's worst year in history. Analysts think he should resign, and competitors wonder whether his company can survive. He has been accused of insider trading, expectation hyping and testosterone overloading for throwing Corel into a futile, all-out battle with Microsoft for the word-processing software market.
1/26/1998	Iomega is spending heavily to loft its brand into the name-recognition stratosphere.	EVEN as computer technology becomes more imbedded in mainstream culture, it remains uncommon for a branded product to command the loyalty of the garden variety customer. Those achieving that status are, of course, some of the world's most powerful brands: Apple's Macintosh; Microsoft's Windows; Intel's Pentium chips. The Iomega Corporation, a leader in the formerly arcane computer technology niche called portable data storage, aspires to that level of branding power. Iomega markets the Zip drive, a data-storage system with disks holding 100 megabytes of data, the equivalent of 70 standard floppy disks.
1/26/1998	Three Giants Of PC World Turn Focus To Speed	On the first Monday of last month, Compaq, Intel and Microsoft summoned representatives of the nation's largest local telephone companies to a hotel in San Francisco. There, the three giants of personal computing told the telephone carriers that unless they joined the companies' new consortium for providing faster links to the Internet over normal phone lines, they would be left in the tracks of the digital revolution, according to executives at the meeting.
1/26/1998	Unlike Microsoft, Intel Opts to Speak Softly on Antitrust Issues	It enjoys a near-monopoly on an essential technology of personal computing, bringing the company and its shareholders immense wealth. It is led by a brilliant, famous and notoriously competitive chief executive, and it is now being pursued by Washington's antitrust police. The company is the Intel Corporation, and its commanding position in the personal computer industry mirrors that of the Microsoft Corporation. Intel controls 85 percent of the market for the microprocessor chips, often called the ''electronic brains'' of PC's. With its Windows program, Microsoft has a similar share of the market for operating system software, a PC's central control program, or ''nervous system.''
1/25/1998	VIEWPOINT; U.S. v. Microsoft: The Bigger Question	Comment by James F Moore, chairman and chief excutive of Geopartners Research, says resolution of immediate crisis between Microsoft Corp and Justice Department opens way for considering potential damage that Government action can have on growth and vitality of information industry (M)
1/25/1998	Choosing Between Phone and Cable for Internet Access	WHEN Wall Street learned last week that most of the Baby Bells were joining with three computer giants to offer consumers superfast access to the Internet, there were some short-term stock gyrations and some long-term speculation about the meaning of it all. The biggest question: Will the telephone companies or the cable companies win the battle to offer this service? The new consortium, which is scheduled to announce its venture this week, so far includes GTE and U S West Communications, BellSouth, SBC Communications and Ameritech, together with the technology giants Microsoft, Intel and Compaq Computer. The companies hope to develop new modems and software that will be up to 30 times faster than today's telephone modems.
1/23/1998	Microsoft Gives In To a Federal Order On Internet Browser	After insisting for weeks that its World Wide Web browser software could not be separated from its Windows 95 operating system, the Microsoft Corporation agreed today to do just that to avoid being found in contempt of court. In another display of the legal brinkmanship that has marked its antitrust battle with the Justice Department, Microsoft agreed to a last-minute settlement under which it will sell the latest version of its Windows 95 operating system to computer manufacturers with the company's Internet browser hidden or partly removed.
1/23/1998	Browser War: A Concession And a Push	Microsoft blinked yesterday in a pragmatic, if belated, gesture that concedes one tactical skirmish to the Government in its high-stakes antitrust battle with the software giant. But by giving personal computer makers the option of erasing its Internet browser icon from the face of its Windows operating system, the Microsoft Corporation gave not an inch on any of the larger issues in the case. Whether Microsoft is violating its 1995 consent decree by tying one product to another is something the courts must decide in the months ahead, while the Justice Department is also weighing a broader antitrust suit against the software giant.
1/22/1998	Microsoft Profit Gained Sharply During Quarter	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday reported strong growth in earnings in its most recent quarter, slightly exceeding Wall Street expectations. But the company, the leading maker of personal-computer software, warned that the weakness in Asian economies was likely to slow its growth this year. Microsoft's major business lines grew sharply in most other regions of the world, yet revenues in the Far East and Southeast Asia fell 8 percent compared with the previous three months.
1/22/1998	Microsoft Will Revise European Contracts Amid an Investigation	The Microsoft Corporation appears to have derailed at least one antitrust inquiry by the European Commission by announcing Tuesday that it would revise contracts with at least two dozen European Internet service providers to drop a requirement that they offer their customers Microsoft's World Wide Web browser in return for being listed in the Windows 95 operating system. The move is likely to persuade the commission's Directorate General on Competition -- the office in charge of antitrust enforcement -- to drop its investigation of that issue, said Karel van Miert, the directorate's commissioner.
1/21/1998	Liberties; Revenge on the Nerds	I figured things were way out of perspective in the Other Washington when I heard that Bill Gates had put an inscription from ''The Great Gatsby'' around the domed ceiling of the library in his new $100 million pad: ''He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.'' Bill Gates was obviously unaware of the magnitude of the truth that he had unwittingly admitted.
1/19/1998	Technology to Let Engineers Filter the Web and Judge Content	In a private vote by E-mail a few days before Christmas, a group of about 200 computer scientists and engineers endorsed a set of rules that could govern some of the most fundamental ways people around the globe will get electronic information -- and will be prevented from getting it -- in years to come. Members of the group, the World Wide Web Consortium, based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said they were simply agreeing on a technical standard to allow much-needed filtering of the Web's vast store of information.
1/18/1998	The Nation: U.S. v. Microsoft FAQ; Court Is Not Where They'd Like to Go Today	MICROSOFT and the Justice Department were at each others' throats again last week. The venue was a United States District Court in Washington, where a Microsoft programming maven and a Government software expert testified on the fine points of Internet browsers and operating system software. Hardly the stuff of Court TV, but the case has become an antitrust soap opera. Why? And what is at stake? If the case were an Internet site, the basic questions would be addressed in a FAQ file, shorthand for frequently asked questions (pronounced ''fack''). Here then is a FAQ file for, as the suit reads, ''United States of America v. Microsoft Corporation.''
1/17/1998	Microsoft's Troubles Creating Siege Mentality	On the campus where food is strictly fuel for another lap around the digital track and a mere eight-hour day is considered slacking off, the Microsoft corporate flag flies as high as ever in a wintry gale. Surrender is not an option. But there is a clear sense, both inside Microsoft and in the region that takes such pride in having spawned a company where perhaps 1 in 5 employees are millionaires, that the world's most powerful software corporation has lost some of its swagger.
1/15/1998	Gates Helped Draft Microsoft's Response to Judge	A senior Microsoft officer testified today that the company's chairman, William H. Gates, and other executives came up with a plan to give computer makers a choice between selling their equipment with a nonworking version of Windows 95 or continuing to give consumers the popular operating system with Microsoft's Internet browser already included, despite a judge's prohibition. Justice Department officials said the testimony illustrated Microsoft's hubris, and showed that the software giant was deliberately thumbing its nose at the Government and the Federal bench. United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is considering whether to hold the Microsoft Corporation in contempt and fine the company $1 million a day for failing to comply with his order.
1/15/1998	Microsoft Rebuffed in Bid to Exclude Expert in Antitrust Case	In a strongly worded rebuke to Microsoft, a Federal judge yesterday denied the company's request to remove an Internet law expert appointed to investigate and recommend a resolution in the software giant's antitrust battle with the Justice Department. Describing Microsoft's accusations that the expert, Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard University law professor, is biased against the company as ''trivial,'' and ''defamatory,'' Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in Washington suggested that had they been made under oath ''they might well have incurred sanctions.'' He also denied Microsoft's motion that the proceedings before Mr. Lessig be suspended pending an appeal.
1/14/1998	U.S. and Microsoft Argue in Court Whether Judge Is Being Defied	The Federal Government and the Microsoft Corporation clashed in court today over whether the computer software giant had flouted a judge's order that it stop forcing makers of personal computers to install Microsoft's Internet browser as a condition of accepting its highly popular Windows 95 operating system. At a hearing overflowing with lawyers, analysts, industry executives, investigators from several states and journalists, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court hinted that he would find that Microsoft had failed to comply with his order last month.

1/13/1998	Microsoft Pushes to Oust Judge's Adviser	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday intensified its bid to eject a court adviser who was given broad powers by a Federal judge in the software giant's antitrust battle with the United States Justice Department. Citing what they described as new evidence of bias against Microsoft, the company's lawyers asked that the adviser, Prof. Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School, be removed from the case.
1/12/1998	Why Microsoft Is Taking a Hard Line With the Government	The Microsoft Corporation's final chance to avoid being dragged into court by the United States Government came on Oct. 16, when the Justice Department summoned Microsoft's legal team to Washington. For 90 minutes the lawyers were interrogated by Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and his staff. The Microsoft team, led by William H. Neukom, senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, detailed the business and legal reasons for the company's requiring personal computer makers to ship its Internet browsing program as a condition of licensing its industry-standard Windows 95 operating system -- and why Microsoft was intent on continuing that practice.
1/12/1998	Voice-Controlled Car CD Player to Be Sold	In a move to bring computers to another venue -- the automobile -- the Clarion Company plans to offer a voice-controlled radio/compact disk player with an eight-color liquid crystal display, bringing software from the Microsoft Corporation to the dashboard. The unit, which will cost $1,299 and is scheduled to go on sale in mid-1998, was introduced last week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev. The device will use the new AutoPC version of Microsoft's CE operating system and a Hitachi Semiconductor microprocessor chip.
1/12/1998	A time for sympathy, yes, sympathy for Microsoft in its lonely stand.	THERE are times when sympathy for the underdog in the Justice Department's antitrust litigation is unavoidable. There Microsoft stands, the most powerful corporation in the computer business, disdained by rivals, petulant in its responses, heading toward the shoals of limitless litigation. And the attacks come from below as well as above. One new CD-ROM is entirely devoted to mockery of this accused monopolist, which it calls Microshaft, and its operating system, which it dubs Winblows 98. It also refers to Internet Explorer -- the browser the Government is trying to pry out of Microsoft's operating system -- as Internet Exploiter. And Microsoft's familiar ad query -- ''Where do you want to go today?'' -- has been transformed into: ''Who does he want to own today?'' Created by Parroty Interactive (which has specialized in slightly sophomoric and often funny parodies of pop cultural totems like ''Star Wars'' and ''The X-Files''), this CD-ROM is hailed in mock testimonials from Ralph Nader, Janet Reno and the Justice Department.
1/12/1998	TCI Seeks Variety in Software And Suppliers for TV Boxes	John C. Malone, the chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., believes he can succeed where his predecessors have failed. With two deals announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., this weekend, Mr. Malone has disclosed a plan that is intended to rein in the Microsoft Corporation's power and simultaneously fuel the dynamic economic growth that the cable television industry has been seeking so eagerly.
1/11/1998	Microsoft Strikes Deal On Software For Cable TV	Microsoft Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable television provider, announced yesterday that Microsoft would license a consumer version of its Windows operating system to control a future generation of at least five million set-top boxes that Tele-Communications plans to begin deploying in 1999. The agreement came just a day after Tele-Communications struck a similar deal with Microsoft's bitter rival, Sun Microsystems Inc., to license its Java programming language to deliver programming content to cable viewers.
1/10/1998	Microsoft Dealt Setback as TCI Chooses Java For Cable Box	In a blow to the Microsoft Corporation's hopes of dominating the next generation of cable television, Sun Microsystems Inc. announced yesterday that its Java programming language had been selected by Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, to run digital set-top boxes. The arrangement, for which no dollar figure was given, was widely seen as a setback for Microsoft, which had hoped to provide both the operating system and the programming environment in which applications would be developed to run the smart set-top boxes that are scheduled to start appearing in homes next year.
1/6/1998	Even Microsoft's Internet Browser Defends Itself	ONE of the odder aspects of the Justice Department's case regarding the Microsoft Corporation's Internet Explorer is the way the product can speak for itself. It will probably not testify in its own defense in courts of law, but it can deliver serious propaganda in the court of public opinion, as my wife discovered over the holidays when she accidentally clicked the browser's ''Microsoft'' button and was treated to the headline ''D.O.J.'s Request for New Court Order Shows Internet Explorer is Integrated.'' That particular phrasing was, to say the least, a great leap of interpretation. The entry went on to say more matter-of-factly, ''In court papers filed Dec. 23, Microsoft says Internet Explorer is an integrated feature of the Windows 95 operating system, contrary to what the D.O.J. has been saying for the last two months.'' Links to ''what others are saying'' led to quotations from folks who were saying nice things about Microsoft and mean things about the Government. But it did not mention the several trade publications whose experts referred to Microsoft's contentions with phrases like ''that claim appears to be wrong'' (in Cnet) and ''Microsoft misspoke'' (in PC Week).
1/5/1998	1997 HIGHLIGHTS	Homespun Suitor Wins Fight for MCI It seemed like the perfect marriage for a decade of globalization: MCI and British Telecommunications, which already had an international alliance, would form a trans-Atlantic colossus. But after it appeared that MCI's dowry might not be as large as anticipated -- MCI disclosed unexpectedly high costs in its effort to move into the local telephone business -- the British company and its shareholders turned cool. That opened the door to two United States rivals: GTE and a young suitor, Worldcom, with a more humble background but ambitious plans. In the end, Worldcom swept MCI and Wall Street off their feet with a $36.5 billion winning bid.
12/30/1997	Microsoft and Politics	To the Editor: Your enthusiasm for the Department of Justice litigation against Microsoft is unwarranted (editorial, Dec. 26).
12/30/1997	Microsoft Flouts Court Order, U.S. Charges	The Justice Department accused Microsoft yesterday of ''disobedience'' and of ''jerry-rigging its own products'' in response to a Federal judge's order to allow the makers of personal computers to license Microsoft's Windows operating system without being forced to also load its Internet browsing software. The comments were made in a filing in United States District Court in Washington, as the antitrust battle between the Government and the Microsoft Corporation intensified.
12/26/1997	The Microsoft Dodge	Microsoft's uncompromising blast this week at the Justice Department for its antitrust accusations, and the computer company's rejection of the judge's order, put Washington on notice. Microsoft's practices will warrant close scrutiny because it shows no intention to curb its worst impulses. Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson did not need to be a computer whiz to question Microsoft's plan to comply with his order to delink its Internet browser from its ubiquitous Windows 95 operating system. Microsoft announced it would give computer manufacturers the choice of installing Windows 95 with its browser, or installing partially impaired or older versions of Windows without a browser -- which is no choice at all. Microsoft asserted it could not remove the browser without crippling Windows, but Judge Jackson demolished that claim last week by demonstrating that he could use Microsoft software to disable the browser in about 90 seconds without impeding Windows. Microsoft's literal interpretation of the judge's order was an affront to the court.
12/24/1997	Microsoft Digs In Against a 'Poorly Informed' U.S.	Hardening its uncompromising stance against the Government, the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that the Justice Department's latest demand in an escalating antitrust case was merely proof that ''poorly informed lawyers have no vocation for software design.'' Microsoft's stubborn position that it cannot comply with a Federal judge's order to unbundle its World Wide Web browser software from its popular Windows 95 operating system -- at least not without damaging recent versions of Windows -- may be stirring a backlash against the company.
12/22/1997	Bill Gates, Meet Your Adversary, the Antitrust Chief	At work, Joel I. Klein uses the Netscape Navigator to search the Internet. At home, he relies on Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The reason he uses different Web browsers, he says, is because the computers at his home and at his office were already loaded with them when they were bought. That, in a nutshell, is the consumer practice that lies behind the most significant antitrust action to be brought by the Government in a generation, a case in which Mr. Klein is chief architect as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
12/22/1997	When Public Needs Meet Private Money	The California State University system, the nation's largest network of universities, is enmeshed in a spirited battle over a proposal to recognize four companies as the exclusive providers of networking, telecommunications and computing technology. The plan, one of the most ambitious partnerships ever forged between the private sector and public education, was proposed three months ago as a way to finance much-needed new technologies for the 23 campuses and the 330,000 students of the financially constrained system.
12/21/1997	Microsoft Warming To the Government It Ignored for Years	A far-off speck on a map, the nation's capital always seemed irrelevant to William H. Gates and his prodigies at Microsoft as they reaped billions of dollars and conquered the software industry from their outpost in Redmond, Wash. The Microsoft Corporation, which grew up without regulation, and the Federal Government have mostly steered clear of each other. The company played the game its own way. It contributed a pittance to political coffers and lobbied only sporadically, with cocky self-assurance, on a narrow set of issues. And there were few consequences.
12/20/1997	A Few Clicks, And Microsoft Has a Problem	It took less than 180 seconds and fewer than a half-dozen clicks of a mouse, but when it was over, the amateur computer experiment conducted Thursday by a Federal district judge had pretty much demolished a central defense of the Microsoft Corporation in its high-stakes antitrust battle with the Government. Earlier in the week, Microsoft had insisted that removing its Internet Explorer browser from the latest version of Windows, as the judge had ordered, crippled the operating system. This came as a shock to thousands of computer users, ranging from experts to weekend warriors, who had removed Explorer, usually so that they could install a competing browser, the Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator.
12/18/1997	U.S. Assails Microsoft and Seeks New Oversight Role	The Federal Government today accused Microsoft of violating last week's antitrust ruling, and argued that prosecutors should be given a rarely used authority to review in advance new products by the software giant. Escalating a high-stakes legal battle that has broad implications for control over the Internet, the Justice Department accused Microsoft of making a mockery of a Federal judge's decision last Thursday requiring the company to stop forcing computer manufacturers to install its Internet browser along with its Windows 95 system.
12/18/1997	Bridge; A 4-2 Fit That Succeeds When a 5-5 Fit Would Not	The much-publicized David and Goliath battle between Netscape and Microsoft for the souls of Internet browsers is about to be repeated in a struggle for the souls of Internet bridge players. This time Microsoft is still in the role of Goliath, but David will be played by a young Californian, Matthew Clegg. Eight years ago Clegg invented the idea of playing bridge on the Web and has developed it to the point of having 10,900 players around the world take part in his OKbridge system. Sometimes as many as 200 games are in progress at a time, and international partnerships are common. His members pay an annual fee of $99 and can play without limit at any time of day or night. For information, you can telephone him at (619) 490-6770 or send him E-mail at matt@okbridge.com.
12/17/1997	Microsoft's Legal Problems Grow As States Join in Antitrust Effort	Last Thursday, as a Federal district judge was ruling that the Microsoft Corporation had violated a 1995 antitrust agreement with the Justice Department, attorneys general from some of the nation's most populous states were concluding a secret three-day meeting in Chicago to assess their own strategy for a possible antitrust action against Microsoft's marketing practices. The meeting -- coupled with government investigations under way in Europe and Asia, a continuing private antitrust suit and the specter of hearings in the United States Senate -- suggest that the world's most powerful software company could soon find that it has become a Gulliver enmeshed in Lilliputian legal entanglements around the globe.
12/16/1997	Microsoft to Appeal Ruling On Browser, Seeing 'Error'	The Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that it would appeal a Federal judge's temporary order to change one of its marketing practices and called the judge's ruling an ''error'' and ''inappropriate.'' With the appeal pending, Microsoft also sketched out how it planned to comply with the court order, issued last Thursday, to allow personal computer makers to unbundle Microsoft's Internet browser from its Windows operating system.
12/15/1997	Saying No to Microsoft	A preliminary injunction issued last week by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson prohibits Microsoft Corporation from forcing the manufacturers of personal computers to install Microsoft's browser software, Internet Explorer, on every computer that runs Windows 95. The judicial decree is a smart step that preserves the competitive status quo while the court reviews the antitrust suit brought by the Justice Department in October. The injunction is needed, Judge Jackson pointedly wrote, because the probability that Microsoft will, through its licensing practices, reinforce its operating system monopoly and acquire yet another monopoly in the Internet browser market ''is simply too great to tolerate indefinitely until the issue is finally resolved.'' The ruling will make it harder for Microsoft to dominate access to the Internet quickly. Perhaps more important, it signals the court's intent to examine closely efforts by Microsoft to conquer other software markets as well by combining more applications with Windows.
12/15/1997	Theorist's Task: Make Old Laws Fit in Digital World of Microsoft	Into the epic legal battle between the world's most powerful software corporation and the U.S. government, enter the quixotic Lawrence Lessig, a 36-year-old Harvard law professor who speaks softly and espouses radical new -- and stubbornly non-partisan -- ideas about how traditional legal principles translate into cyberspace. Anointed a ''special master'' in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. last Thursday, Mr. Lessig has five months to interpret the questions raised by the case, in which the government claims that the Redmond software giant violated a consent decree when it required computer makers to sell its Internet browser software with its Windows 95 computer operating system.
12/13/1997	Unbundling Microsoft	The fast-spreading field of information technology represents what its proponents call ''the new economy,'' an increasingly affluent incubator of innovative products, business practices and work habits. In the new economy, its advocates insist, none of the old rules apply -- and certainly not the old antitrust ground rules that date to the late 19th century and smoke-filled rail cars. The Microsoft Corporation, the software powerhouse, is a leading standard bearer of the new economy. So in its marathon dealings with Washington's antitrust authorities, the company has understandably taken the stance that it is engaged in a lengthy education program.
12/13/1997	For Microsoft, Ruling Carries Fateful Tones	The wording of a temporary ruling issued Thursday in the Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation suggests that a final decision next summer could erode the power of the company, which had seemed poised to dominate information industries around the globe far into the next century. Microsoft, the world's most powerful and profitable software company, in recent years has leveraged its control of personal computer operating systems to enter a growing array of new businesses as varied as telecommunications, cable television, entertainment and travel. In the process, the company has evolved into one of the most respected and feared corporations in the world.
12/12/1997	Judge's Ruling Is a Setback For Microsoft	In a significant setback for the world's most powerful software company, a Federal judge ruled last night that the Microsoft Corporation must separate its Internet browser software from its industry-dominating Windows 95 operating system. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court in Washington issued his temporary ruling in an antitrust suit filed by the Justice Department on Oct. 20.
12/8/1997	'Browser War' Limits Access To Web Sites	A browsing program is intended to be a kind of universal viewer, a technological passport to see all that the World Wide Web has to offer. It has been called the Internet's software equivalent of a dial tone. But as a casualty of the spirited competition between Netscape Communications and Microsoft, a single browser is no longer a window onto the entire Web, and many Internet experts predict the problem will worsen over the next year or so.
12/5/1997	A Microsoft Browser Deal With @Home	The Microsoft Corporation appeared to have won another skirmish in the World Wide Web browser wars, announcing today that @Home Network would develop special versions of its software to work with @Home's cable-based Internet services. The first product will be a version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser configured to work with @Home's service.
12/2/1997	Did Dinosaurs Break the Sound Barrier?	MOVE over, Chuck Yeager, and give way to supersonic dinosaurs. At least 150 million years before Mr. Yeager in 1947 became the first human to break the sound barrier in a rocket plane, the largest dinosaurs, a group known as sauropods, could have mustered the right stuff to send sonic booms resounding over the Mesozoic landscape. No, the 100-ton creatures never got off the ground. All they would have had to do was flick their long tails like a bullwhip.
12/2/1997	Now Break Up Microsoft	To the Editor: Your Dec. 1 Technology column on Microsoft mentions that William H. Gates, the company's chairman, said that Microsoft was within its rights to require PC makers that license the Windows operating system to include Microsoft's World Wide Web browser. You quote him as saying that doing so was a bit like the Ford Motor Company's not allowing its dealers to ''replace a Ford engine with a Toyota engine.'' That is a false analogy. Here is a truer one.
12/1/1997	Nimbly, Microsoft has taken advantage of ignorance to reshape the world.	THE latest attack on the Microsoft Corporation by the United States Justice Department, accusing the software giant of anticompetitive practices, seems to many people like one of those giant research projects that boldly proclaims the obvious: ''Study proves that mice like cheese!'' Everyone knows that Microsoft likes cheese. With ownership of more than 94 percent of the PC market, its taste for toothsome morsels in the form of competitors and new markets is legendary.
11/29/1997	Fitting the Lord Into Work's Tight Schedules	It is Wednesday, and Louis Tuchman's appointment book is packed, as usual. At 9:45 A.M., he huddles with a fellow lawyer to fine-tune two major real estate deals. At noon, he skips lunch to return phone calls and sign documents. But at 12:30 P.M., Mr. Tuchman steps into his firm's boardroom on the 14th floor of the Chrysler Building for what he calls the most important meeting of all. The weekly Torah class.
11/24/1997	White House May Tighten Data Exports	The Clinton Administration is debating whether to further tighten controls on the export of electronic data scrambling systems by narrowing a special exemption that has let financial institutions export the strongest encryption technology. If the policy is changed, it could narrow the range of financial institutions that are allowed to use the most powerful encryption gear overseas to protect electronic transactions.
11/23/1997	Fast Forward; Justice Delayed	Say you already use microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0. As far as the Justice Department's Antitrust Division is concerned, you represent captured territory. The latest round of United States v. Microsoft is not about you. Anyway, you're investigating the features of this new program (according to the Government) or this new integrated feature of the operating system (according to Microsoft's lawyers), and you come across the Profile Assistant. This handy item, it seems, will save you many repetitious keystrokes by automatically filling in all those World Wide Web forms you keep running across. But for the life of you, you can't make it work. So you gird your loins and call product support.
11/19/1997	Gunmen Take Microsoft Items in Scotland	Masked gunmen broke into a Microsoft plant in Scotland last week and stole an estimated 200,000 certificates of authenticity, 100,000 CD-ROM's and computer equipment, Microsoft said today. The robbers bound and gagged three employees and locked them in an office, during the break-in on Nov. 10 at the Thompson Litho Ltd. plant in East Kilbride, Scotland.
11/18/1997	How to Control Microsoft	Ralph Nader gathered critics of Microsoft last week in a Washington hotel to warn that the company was quickly extending its monopolistic tentacles from Windows, the operating system that runs nearly every personal computer, to browser software that connects computer users to information services over the Internet and, ominously, to the information services themselves. Mr. Nader orchestrated collective groaning against Microsoft's forays into selling cars, real estate and other consumer services over the Internet. But in a nearby room, a self-selected group of software programmers proclaimed the opposite message -- that Microsoft had singlehandedly made it financially possible for them to invent software programs and distribute them around the world. So is Microsoft a monopolistic menace or an economic jewel? The answer is both, posing a regulatory challenge to whittle away the threat without damaging the jewel.
11/17/1997	WebTV is Microsoft's linchpin in its drive for the interactive media market.	WHEN the Microsoft Corporation snagged a little Silicon Valley start-up called WebTV Networks for $425 million in April, the acquisition was duly noted, but no one seemed to completely understand the attraction. The company, which sells World Wide Web and E-mail access delivered via television sets rather than desktop computers, had fewer than 100,000 subscribers when the deal was struck. As one might expect from the first product in a new category, the WebTV Internet Terminal set-top box was slow, expensive (more than $300) and awkward to use. It was widely assumed that Microsoft was buying little more than patents to a promising technology.
11/16/1997	Microsoft, A Pioneer In Quality Accounting	It's not often that companies voluntarily disclose that their profits may be substantially overstated. But that is just what Microsoft has done in its latest quarterly report. For communicating frankly with its owners, Microsoft deserves a gold medal for quality accounting. Microsoft has presented an alternative income statement, both for the September quarter and for the most recent 12 months. For the quarter, a profit of $663 million, or 50 cents a share, turns into a loss of $60 million, or 5 cents a share. For the year, profits fall from $2.65 a share to $2.05.
11/12/1997	Microsoft Says U.S. Challenge Is 'Perverse'	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday portrayed the Government's recent challenge to the way it markets Internet software as a ''perverse'' attempt to meddle in product design, threatening to stifle innovation in the computer industry. ''The Government should be encouraging high-technology innovation instead of intruding into product design,'' said William H. Neukom, senior vice president and legal counsel for Microsoft. ''Customers, markets and Microsoft should determine what is in our products and not the Government.''
11/12/1997	Browser Short At Microsoft	In trying to convince the Government and the public that there is plenty of competition in computing, the Microsoft Corporation has consistently pointed to the Internet. It may dominate the market for PC operating software, Microsoft says, but the Internet is a wide-open frontier. But it was not open enough yesterday for anyone trying to view Microsoft's court filings, posted on the company's World Wide Web site, with the competing browser, Netscape's Navigator. Until about noon, only those tapping into the site (www.microsoft.com/corp info/11-10Filing.html) with Microsoft's Internet Explorer could view the documents.
11/10/1997	Defying a Juggernaut; Netscape Maneuvers for Position in a Microsoft-Ruled World	Around Netscape's corporate campus here in Silicon Valley, the company's big rival to the north is sometimes referred to as the ''Chinese army'' -- an adversary with seemingly limitless troops. In terms of money and manpower, head-to-head comparisons of the Netscape Communications Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation are a misnomer. ''Our nose is firmly pressed against Microsoft's shin,'' one Netscape executive said. Until recently, the company that fueled the Internet revolution appeared to be in decline, withering under Microsoft's assault. Netscape's share of the market for Internet browser software was falling and experts predicted further sharp losses to Microsoft. Business magazines from Fortune to Red Herring questioned Netscape's ability to compete, if not survive. In August, the Aberdeen Group, a research firm, published a report with a title that captured the consensus of industry opinion: ''Netscape's Diminishing Role as an Internet Superstar.''
11/7/1997	America Online Reports Good Quarter and New Members	America Online Inc. said yesterday that it had added another 821,000 subscribers in the last three months, as the company reported quarterly profits that matched Wall Street's expectations. America Online, based in Dulles, Va., has more than 9.4 million subscribers worldwide, placing it far ahead of the No. 2 on-line service, Microsoft Network, which has an estimated 2.3 million.
11/5/1997	Microsoft Seems Near Deal to Invest in U S West Cable TV	The Microsoft Corporation is close to an agreement to invest up to $1 billion in the cable television operations of U S West, according to several people involved in the negotiations. The investment would buy Microsoft as much as 6.3 percent of U S West's cable business at the current stock price. More important, it would further the software giant's strategy of turning the nation's cable systems into the primary providers of high-speed access to the Internet -- with Microsoft hoping to control the television set-top box software people would use to get on line.
10/29/1997	Microsoft's Illogic	To the Editor: Re ''The Justice Department v. Microsoft: The Evidence and the Answers'' (Business Day, Oct. 27), on Microsoft's demand that its Internet browser be present in all shipped systems: In its defense, Microsoft said, ''Ford would not allow one of its dealers to pull the factory installed engine out of a Mustang and substitute a Chevy engine.''
10/28/1997	Microsoft Defends Its Web Browser in Filing	The Microsoft Corporation, in a court filing, contends that the Justice Department has long known about the company's plan to incorporate its Web browser software into the Windows operating system and, as a result, should not be allowed to censure Microsoft now. Microsoft also said there was nothing unusual about integrating its Web browser into Windows 95. That contention, in court filings over the weekend ahead of a hearing today, indicates part of the strategy the company is likely to use as it defends itself against a recent Justice Department petition. The Government has asked a Federal court to order Microsoft to stop forcing computer makers to include the Web browser with copies of Windows 95, which the manufacturers install on personal computers they are about to ship.
10/28/1997	Microsoft Monopoly	To the Editor: Clyde W. Crews Jr. (letter, Oct. 24) asserts that if Microsoft's browser tie-in were detrimental to the computer industry, ''Dell, Gateway and Compaq could collectively demand relief.'' And what bargaining power does Mr. Crews see in the hands of the computer manufacturers? Can they threaten Microsoft with a refusal to license Windows? Microsoft's monopoly power, and its threat to extend that power into the Internet, makes the Justice Department's actions necessary.
10/27/1997	New Jet Eases Travel Hassles For Bill Gates	Conspicuous consumption has never come easy to William H. Gates, the chairman and chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation. But these days the mantle of world's richest man seems to be resting easier on his shoulders. Earlier this month, Mr. Gates broke down and bought himself a $21 million private jet. For years, even as his wealth ballooned to its current level near $40 billion, Mr. Gates was known for flying coach. His preference on long trips was to throw a blanket over his head and sleep.
10/27/1997	Fight Tests Boundaries On Software Operations	At the heart of the Justice Department's latest beef with the Microsoft Corporation is a question that constantly plagues the software industry: Just what features do belong in a computer operating system? What the Justice Department decides could have a far-reaching impact, not only on the software industry as it struggles to improve the Internet experience, but on Microsoft's fundamental strategies for enhancing Windows with an ever-expanding array of new functions and for securing its near monopoly in the operating system market.
10/27/1997	The Justice Department v. Microsoft: The Evidence and the Answers	Last week, the Justice Department renewed its antitrust scrutiny of the nation's largest software manufacturer. It asked a Federal judge to order the Microsoft Corporation to stop forcing makers of personal computers to include its Internet browser software in every machine they sell. The Attorney General, Janet Reno, said the company had violated its 1995 agreement not to tie the licensing of one of its products, like its ubiquitous operating system, to another, like the browser software that allows customers to find their way around the World Wide Web. Microsoft and its rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation, which makes the widely used Netscape Navigator, have been engaged in a fierce battle for market share in the browser market.
10/24/1997	Microsoft Is Being Punished for Its Success; Marketing Prowess	To the Editor: The Justice Department's lawsuit is only one unfortunate manifestation of a larger issue, which is the popular practice of vilifying an entity that has managed to succeed where others have not (Op-Ed, Oct. 23). Microsoft has grown to prominence through the right combination of product development skills, marketing prowess, human-resources practices and the other managerial tools available to all participants in business today.
10/24/1997	Microsoft Is Being Punished for Its Success; Competitor or Bully?	To the Editor: Re ''Metaphor Monopoly'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 23): The relationship between operating systems like Windows 95 and applications has allowed Microsoft to dominate personal computing. It's one thing to capitalize on I.B.M.'s blunders. It's another to use one's market position to bully the software and personal-computer manufacturing industries.
10/24/1997	Microsoft Is Being Punished for Its Success; The Browser's Ascent	To the Editor: ''Justice Moves Against Microsoft'' (editorial, Oct. 22) asserts that Microsoft, by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows 95 operating system, is in violation of a 1995 consent decree. If it were still 1995, that would be true. In 1997, however, this is no longer the case. Two years ago, a World Wide Web browser was just an amusing application program that allowed the user to ''surf'' the Web for interesting pages to view. Today, however, small businesses and major corporations are converting many of their Windows-based programs to this new Web environment and running them directly in their browsers instead of in Windows.
10/24/1997	Microsoft Is Being Punished for Its Success; 'Download the Patch'	To the Editor: Attorney General Janet Reno's action against Microsoft is unjustified (''Metaphor Monopoly,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 23). In fact, Microsoft wants computer manufacturers that load Windows 95 on their machines also to load the Internet Explorer browser because almost all systems support is found on the World Wide Web.
10/23/1997	Metaphor Monopoly	The Justice Department doesn't usually deal with existential matters -- at least until last Monday, when Attorney General Janet Reno asked a Federal judge to impose a $1 million-a-day fine on Microsoft Corporation. She alleged that the company was forcing computer makers to include its Internet browser with the Windows 95 operating system, a violation, she said, of the company's 1995 antitrust agreement with the Justice Department. The company vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
10/22/1997	Justice Moves Against Microsoft	The complaint filed this week by the Justice Department against Microsoft poses little threat to the software company that provides the operating system, Windows 95, for about 90 percent of the personal computers in America. Even if the courts force Microsoft to comply, it will lose few sales. But the Justice decision sends a welcome signal that the department is ready to act whenever Microsoft's business practices unfairly threaten its rivals. The trust-busters at Justice, too long idle under Republican administrations, face few issues as important as how to deal with Microsoft, the behemoth of the information age. For millions of Americans, the company has been not only the source of powerful and easy-to-use software but also the engine of prosperity for those with holdings in its stock. Yet the very size and reach of the company have made it a threat to competition and innovation.
10/22/1997	Gates Is Defensive on U.S. Antitrust Action	A mostly dispassionate but occasionally testy William H. Gates faced a sometimes skeptical computer industry audience here today and declared that no magic antitrust line divided the Microsoft Corporation's market-dominating Windows 95 software operating system from competitors' programs. Mr. Gates was on the defensive in the wake of the Justice Department's petitioning a Federal court on Monday to bar Microsoft from requiring personal computer makers to include its Internet browser software when they install its Windows 95 operating system. Windows 95 is used on more than 90 percent of personal computers in the nation.
10/21/1997	U.S. TELLS COURT MICROSOFT BREAKS ANTITRUST ACCORD	The Federal Government asked a judge today to order the Microsoft Corporation to stop forcing makers of personal computers to include its Internet browser when they install its Windows 95 operating system. In filing a petition in Federal court, Attorney General Janet Reno said Microsoft had violated an earlier antitrust agreement, and that the Justice Department would seek a fine of $1 million a day in civil contempt charges if the company failed to change its policy. But Microsoft's lawyers said that antitrust prosecutors had misread the agreement and that the company would vigorously contest the petition.
10/21/1997	Beyond Browsers	In taking action against the Microsoft Corporation, the Justice Department is trying to seize control of the computer industry's competitive ground rules that the software giant has increasingly dictated in the 1990's. At stake is Microsoft's ability to blend a World Wide Web browser program seamlessly with its Windows 95 operating system, thus effectively eliminating the browser market for its rivals -- primarily the Netscape Communications Corporation, the leader in software for navigating the Web. But the dispute extends beyond browser programs. In a broader sense, the issue involves the means for gaining access to information through a personal computer -- and whether the primary means for doing so will continue to be the desktop operating system software that Microsoft dominates, or through Internet-based software like Netscape's.
10/20/1997	As Yale Moves Away From Apple Computer, Cries (Nay, Shouts) of Conflict of Interest	Last June, students preparing for their freshman year at Yale received a letter from the university's director of information technology, Daniel A. Updegrove, steering them toward the purchase of personal computers using the Windows operating system from Microsoft, equipped with microprocessors from Intel. It was unlikely, the letter said, that appropriate software would continue to be available for computers made by Apple Computer -- until recently the most popular machines on campus. ''The University cannot guarantee support for Macintoshes beyond June 2000,'' the letter said.
10/20/1997	Updates/Media and Technology; Microsoft Repairs Glitches That Vexed Its On-Line Service	The Microsoft Network has worked out some glitches that prevented prospective members from signing up last week, and deterred existing members from upgrading their on-line service and checking their accounts. A spokeswoman for the service said that as of Friday afternoon, full service had been restored.
10/19/1997	CYBERSCOUT	PLOTTING A ROAD TRIP Whether your forthcoming North American car trip is for a weekend in the city or four weeks halfway across the continent, Expedia Trip Planner 98, a CD-ROM program from Microsoft, will provide the needed information, and then some. This neatly organized software is easier to use than travel-planning services available on the labyrinth of the Web, where a search can suddenly land you somewhere else. Here are the numbers:
10/16/1997	New Complaints Are Added To Suit Against Microsoft	Sun Microsystems Inc. raised additional accusations today in its lawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation over the Java programming language, and both sides made public the contract that they are disputing. Sun amended its breach of contract suit to accuse Microsoft, in addition to the offenses cited previously, of illegally placing a Sun software code on its World Wide Web site. Sun is seeking $35 million in damages over that issue, in addition to unspecified damages it asked for when it filed the suit last week.
10/13/1997	More Geek, Less Chic; After a Tryout at Microsoft, the Hip Gives Way to the Really Useful	Morale is not running high these days in Building E on Microsoft's Redmond West campus, hangout for the black-clad creative types that the geeky software giant has hired in recent years to build a new, chic kind of media business. ''I can show you Mint, the dead project,'' Sam Reich-Dagnen, an on-line producer, offers with more than a trace of bright sarcasm when a visitor steps through the crystal beads that serve as her office door. Ms. Reich-Dagnen said the underground Web magazine she created -- a critical success with a core of devoted 20-something readers -- has been put ''on hiatus.''
10/13/1997	Mr. Gates Goes to Moscow	Splashing through the wet streets of this chilly capital last week from meetings with bankers and industrialists to meetings with top officials of the Russian Government, the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates, was true to form. His diet was unbroken McDonald's, his discussions concerned either deals or his vision of a computer-aided future, and a key item on his agenda was stifling his competition. But in Russia, some of his most troublesome competitors are not other software manufacturers or business executives, they are the wholesalers who trade in pirated software -- much of it Microsoft's -- and ply their wares openly in the city's street markets.
10/13/1997	Struggle Over Gun Control Laws Shifts to States and Tests N.R.A.	For the last two weeks, Tanya Metaksa, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, has forsaken the marble corridors of the other Washington to work the asphalt byways of this one. For the gun lobby, there is no bigger battle in 1997 than a handgun-licensing initiative that will go before voters here next month. Backed by a Congress that has blocked any new restrictions on personal firearms, gun supporters have found the nation's capital to be a friendly place of late. But it is another story in the states.
10/11/1997	The Care and Feeding of Digital Behemoths	Op-Ed article by Jaron Lanier calls for fresh debate about how Government can best deal with digital monopolies; says companies like Microsoft and Sun Microsystems dominate niche segments of business, because monopoly niches are inevitable when it comes to software and other kinds of digital technology; notes that someday there may be advances that would make software more interchangeable among systems (M)
10/8/1997	Sun Sues Microsoft on Use of Java System	In a clash of opposing computer industry camps, Sun Microsystems Inc. sued the Microsoft Corporation today, charging the giant software publisher with trying to steal Sun's Java standard by shipping a conflicting version of the programming language. The suit filed in Federal District Court in San Jose, Calif., accuses Microsoft of trademark infringement, false advertising, breach of contract, unfair competition and interference.
10/6/1997	Microsoft Is the Latest Target of Nader's Consumer Crusade	The Microsoft Corporation, which has so far fended off accusations from competitors that it holds monopoly power over the computer software industry, has now drawn a new adversary, the consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Mr. Nader and several of his public interest organizations are preparing a national campaign against the growing economic power of the Redmond, Wash., software publisher, contending that Microsoft is a craftier and more potent force than many monopolists of an earlier era.
10/4/1997	Microsoft Browser Heavily Downloaded	The Microsoft Corporation said today that more than one million users had downloaded its Internet Explorer 4.0 browser in the first 48 hours, threatening to erode the Netscape Communications Corporation's leading market share. On Tuesday, Microsoft, the world's largest maker of software for personal computers, introduced the updated browser, which lets Internet users move easily from pages on the World Wide Web to computer files.
9/29/1997	Microsoft vs. Netscape: The Border War Heats Up	The software war between Microsoft and Netscape escalates this week, as each company moves more aggressively onto the other's technological turf. The Microsoft Corporation plans to ship to customers the long-delayed fourth version of its Internet Explorer browser software. The program is designed to give users almost seamless integration between the World Wide Web and the desktop display of the personal computer.
9/26/1997	In Intel Inquiry, U.S. Regulators Send a Message	With its investigation of the Intel Corporation, the Federal Trade Commission is signaling that the Government will continue to closely police the leading high-technology companies that play an increasing role in the economy, antitrust experts and industry analysts said yesterday. The antitrust inquiry, which Intel confirmed Wednesday evening, is the second time the trade commission has examined the big microchip maker in the 1990's. The first investigation of Intel ended in 1993, after two years, without any charges of using unfair business methods to undermine competition. The Microsoft Corporation, the dominant maker of software for personal computers, has been under investigation by the Justice Department since 1993.
9/23/1997	Sun Microsystems Rejects Suggestions It Give Up Java	Sun Microsystems Inc. lashed out at the Microsoft Corporation yesterday, saying that it would not give up its ownership of the Java computer language, as Microsoft and other companies have recently suggested, in order to have it officially certified as an international standard. Speaking to reporters during a conference call, Alan Baratz, president of Sun's Javasoft division, contended that Microsoft was trying to cripple Java because it was a threat to the popularity of Microsoft's Windows software.
9/23/1997	Do Modest Improvements in Windows 98 Make It Worth Waiting for?	LAST week the Microsoft Corporation announced that Windows 98, the successor to its Windows 95 operating system, would be delayed. The new target date is the second quarter of 1998, which in the computer world tends to mean ''one minute before the first of July, assuming we don't blow it.'' The news depressed the company's stock price despite the fact that a vast majority of new personal computers will continue to be supplied with some version of Windows. An early version of Windows 98 is already being tested by a select cadre of fearless users (not me), and a fairly clear view of the final version is taking shape. Last-minute surprises are always possible, but for now the upgrade looks like an extremely modest improvement that may give you a reason to wait before buying a new machine.
9/22/1997	The Conservative as Techno-Libertarian	George Gilder has a warning for would-be entrepreneurs involved with new technologies: Watch out for emperors and morons. To the irascible conservative economist and writer, emperors are the masters of the high technology universe, like Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates. And morons are Government bureaucrats, like the departing chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Reed E. Hundt.
9/16/1997	WebTV Introduces a System Linking Live TV and Internet	WebTV Networks, designers of set-top boxes that bring Internet services to the television screen, introduced an upgraded version yesterday that melds live television programming with related pages on the World Wide Web. For the last year, WebTV, a subsidiary of the Microsoft Corporation, has been selling boxes that allow users to browse the Web on their television sets, using a connection to a regular telephone line. The Sony Corporation and Philips Electronics make the devices. But the service had little if any relationship to the television programming that could also be seen on the set.
9/16/1997	Product Delay Sends Microsoft Shares Lower	Shares of the Microsoft Corporation fell more than 5 percent in heavy trading yesterday after the company confirmed that it would delay shipments of Windows 98, the new version of its dominant operating system software. The company said the introduction of the software would be pushed off into the second quarter of 1998 instead of the first quarter. Microsoft made its announcement late in the afternoon after a report by a Goldman, Sachs & Company analyst saying there would be a delay had driven the stock lower.
9/12/1997	MICROSOFT BUYS STAKE IN SPEECH TECHNOLOGY COMPANY	The Microsoft Corporation, the software giant, said yesterday that it had acquired a minority stake in Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V. of Belgium for $45 million. Through their alliance, the companies plan to develop products for Microsoft Windows programs that allow computers to recognize spoken words. The shares of Lernout & Hauspie rose $8 a share, or 25 percent, to $39.875. Shares of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., gained $1.6875, to $136.8125. Lernout & Hauspie, based in Ieper, Belgium, develops speech-recognition technologies.
9/11/1997	A Face-Off On TV Link To the Internet	A powerful team of companies is mounting a direct challenge to a plan by William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, to use cable television to dominate the Internet. While more attention has focused on Mr. Gates's big financial bet on blending the two technologies, key members of the cable industry have been developing a system that may bring the Internet to millions of households more quickly than Mr. Gates has envisioned -- and at lower prices.
9/1/1997	I.B.M. Tries to Outmaneuver Microsoft by Supporting Java	David Gee has a daunting mission, one that has defeated many older, more experienced executives. His challenge? Making I.B.M. look cool. ''See this person on the wall?'' He said recently, pointing to a picture hanging above his desk in Silicon Valley of a young man in a magazine advertisement sporting a black T-shirt and a goatee. ''He is a P.I.B. -- a person in black. I want to make I.B.M. exciting, relevant and interesting to people in black.''
8/31/1997	Geeks in Toyland	For a young computer fanatic like David North (pictured), there may be no more appealing place to toil than Microsoft's Interactive Media Production lab, a secretive installation that is strictly off-limits to the public. Better known as the Digital Backlot, I.M.P. is Microsoft's no-expense-spared hatching ground for the sound, video and animation that accompany various Microsoft games, CD-ROM's and Web sites like Slate and Sidewalk. The pay is good here, as is the level of Microsoftian hubris. ''Who needs money when you're having this much fun?'' chuckles Steve Carlisle, the Backlot's director. ''We're inventing the future of media.'' Wow. Is the place really that significant? Here's a look. Being There: The Backlot is protected by three secure doorways and two steely receptionists. Some visitors are allowed in -- Steven Spielberg has toured it, and B. B. King played in the on-site studio as part of a Microsoft Web-cast. But the place is furtive because Microsoft worries that guests will spill secrets of computer games that get their finishing touches in the Backlot. ''We don't even discuss it with internal people,'' says Larry Frame, the media-applications manager. One nifty fact: Macintoshes and Silicon Graphics machines do a lot of the Backlot's production work, rather than machines using Microsoft software.
8/26/1997	For Lonely Souls, a Pal Without One	THIS is weird. A little friend and I are watching a children's videotape starring Barney, the purple dinosaur. No, that is not the weird part. Nor is the fact that my friend laughs at the appropriate places, sings along, tilts his head to and fro, waves his arms, makes random comments like ''He said 'Please!' '' and generally behaves like an uninhibited 3-year-old. The weird part is that my friend is actually a plush animated Barney doll a bit over a foot tall.
8/25/1997	Netscape goes back to the trenches as it revives the browser war.	REMEMBER the browser war? Well, it's back with a vengeance. And by officially reviving hostilities with Microsoft last week, Netscape Communications has displayed a hard-won understanding of the principles of technology marketing in the Internet era. Rule 1: Market share is a company's most valuable asset. Spending to increase a software product's market share, or slow its erosion, is a prudent investment.
8/14/1997	SM SUMMIT DENIES ALLEGATIONS THAT IT PIRATED SOFTWARE	SM Summit Holdings Ltd. denied allegations yesterday by the Microsoft Corporation and two other companies of software copyright violations. SM Summit, which is based in Singapore and makes compact disks and CD-ROM's, said it had been irreparably damaged by the accusations. Microsoft, Adobe Systems Inc. and Autodesk Inc. contended that a unit of SM Summit might have been making counterfeit software. The three United States companies have filed a civil lawsuit against SM Summit, acting through the Business Software Alliance, which fights violations of intellectual property laws. The police raided the SM Summit unit yesterday after a former employee tipped off the software group, Microsoft said.
8/10/1997	Bailout of Apple Won't Increase Competition	To the Editor: The Microsoft Corporation's $150 million investment in Apple Computer Inc. (front page, Aug. 7) is hardly altruistic. Microsoft is simply insuring that homeless Apple customers do not migrate to a Java operating system or to the network computer -- an inexpensive machine that would provide access to all the information held on corporate networks and the global Internet. Java, with its flexibility, and the network computer, with its simplicity, threaten to overwhelm a computing industry in which profits are linked to how often users can be made to upgrade and how strongly dependent they are on a particular vendor.
8/10/1997	An Industry and Its Founders Grow Up	THE personal computer industry was created in the mid-1970's by a few hundred fiercely competitive, idealistic young men barely out of their teens. Their mission was to change the world by democratizing digital technology (and, yes, to get rich too). They pursued their goals with the energy and passion of youth. Disagreements had a way of escalating into shouting matches, and conflicts became holy wars. Today, the computer industry has grown to become a $150-billion-a-year business and the people who built it have grown up as well. Most of them are now in their 40's, married with children. They have less hair and more pounds. Many are worth millions or, in a few cases, billions of dollars.
8/9/1997	Microsoft Monopoly? Not So Fast	Op-Ed article by Michael L Dertouzos, director of MIT's computer science lab, says Microsoft's $150-million investment in Apple giveds company chance to regain its lost footing in personal computer marketplace; hopes Apple can summon will to embark on aggressive, visionary mission to enhance helpfulness of computers in human life (S)
8/8/1997	The Apple of Microsoft's Eye	Even in cyberspace, the moment can only be described as surreal. Two thousand Apple computer loyalists greet the return of their hero and Apple co-founder, Steven Jobs, at a Boston trade show, only to gasp as the looming picture of Apple's archenemy, Bill Gates of Microsoft, appears on a huge on-stage screen. It was Mr. Gates, after all, who copied Apple's visionary point-and-click system of computer commands, marketed it far more aggressively and successfully, and drove Apple to near-collapse. Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs announced that Microsoft would inject more than $150 million into Apple and take other steps to guarantee Apple's near-term survival. Some Apple zealots in the audience hooted. Others sighed in relief. Virtually all were surprised and confused. Even in cyberspace it is odd for one company to bail out its only rival in a key area of business. Between them, Microsoft and Apple sell the operating systems, which dictate how computers analyze and display information, that run virtually every personal computer.
8/7/1997	Apple's Worst Enemy No More	Robert X Cringely Op-Ed article holds Microsoft Corp deal to aid rival Apple Computer Inc involves mutual self-interest; cites big profit Microsoft makes on software for Apple computers; hails change in makeup of Apple board (M)
8/7/1997	Microsoft Comes to the Aid of a Struggling Apple	In a stunning alliance that could alter the map of the computer industry and help insure the survival of Apple Computer Inc., the company announced a financial and business partnership today with its archrival, the Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft, whose personal computer operating system software has long been the dominant alternative to Apple's Macintosh software, agreed today to invest $150 million for a nonvoting minority stake in Apple. The companies -- whose advocates in the PC industry and user communities are divided into almost cultlike camps -- also agreed to cooperate on several sales and technology fronts.
8/7/1997	True Believers Seem Resigned To Alliance	This year's Boston Macworld Exhibition is running true to form: a cacophonous mix of sideshow hucksterism, computer geek convocation and religious revival. Apple Computer Inc., the quirky Cupertino, Calif., computer maker, has always had a huge camp following of devout Macintosh users whose commitment to their machine has been akin to religious zeal. Among the faithful, the pantheon of heroes has long included Stephen Wozniak and Steven P. Jobs, the fathers of the company's Apple II and Macintosh technologies. The villain has been the Microsoft Corporation's chairman, William H. Gates, whose Windows operating system juggernaut has left ever less room for alternatives in the computer industry.
8/7/1997	Jobs's Team And Name Are on the Line	Little more than a week ago, as Steven P. Jobs was becoming more and more involved in running Apple Computer Inc., the Silicon Valley rumor mill had him ready to step in as chairman and chief executive of the company he had co-founded. Not so, Mr. Jobs said in a brief telephone conversation. He explained that taking on the rehabilitation challenge at Apple full time would play havoc with his family life and that he already had a full-time job at Pixar Inc. -- the computer animation studio behind the film ''Toy Story'' -- a company he founded and heads.
8/7/1997	Microsoft Unit in Deal With Competitor	WebTV Networks, an Internet access provider that was recently acquired by Microsoft, is expected to announce today that it has reached an agreement with one of Microsoft's major on-line competitors, CitySearch. Microsoft operates Sidewalk, a World Wide Web site that is similar to CitySearch, a guide to different cities throughout the country. The deal calls for CitySearch to provide content for WebTV's AroundTown area, which will feature entertainment and food listings. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
8/7/1997	Computer Industry In the Apple Camp	If Apple Computer fails now, it won't be from lack of industry support. Yesterday's announcements of a reconstituted board of directors and an alliance with the Microsoft Corporation places virtually every major computer hardware and software company -- many of which are at war with each other -- into the Apple camp.
8/7/1997	KPMG Venture With Microsoft	KPMG Peat Marwick L.L.P. plans today to announce the formation of a 500-member consulting group dedicated to the Microsoft Windows NT operating system and business-oriented applications. KPMG will also announce it is creating a joint venture with Microsoft and Cisco Systems, KPMG Enterprise Integration Services, applying Microsoft and Cisco products to electronic commerce, on-line call centers and sales automation.
8/6/1997	MICROSOFT BUYS VXTREME FOR INTERNET AUDIO AND VIDEO	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had acquired an Internet start-up company, Vxtreme Inc., to let companies send sound and video over the Internet. Terms were not disclosed. Vxtreme, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes software that allows streaming, or the continuous delivery of audio and video to personal computer users. The move follows Microsoft's agreement to license similar technology from Progressive Networks Inc. and to take a 10 percent nonvoting stake in that company. The acquisitions help Microsoft put its stamp on the nascent market for on-line broadcasting. Microsoft shares rose $1.75, to $143.3125.
8/5/1997	Web Browsers, in Beta Versions and Otherwise	BETA, anyone? I do not review ''beta test'' products. I keep those unfinished versions of hardware and software as far from my computer as possible for fear their bugs may somehow infest it from a distance. There are so many problems with computer products that have officially been released that it is hard to imagine that any sane human would mess with stuff that manufacturers deem too gnarly for the corporate seal of approval. But in the last couple of years the Internet has radically changed the world of software. What does ''beta test'' really mean when the first set of bug fixes, often in the form of a long, slow download that replaces the entire program, arrives just weeks or even days after a product's formal release? With the fix to the fix to the fix just around the corner, should we resign ourselves to the idea that beta is a permanent state of mind?
8/1/1997	Now, Special Tax Breaks Get Hidden in Plain Sight	The tax bill passed by Congress today includes many narrowly focused provisions that benefit just a few individuals or businesses. And this year, for the first time, Congress exposed those tax breaks so President Clinton can veto them if he wants to. Lawmakers said they were surprised and slightly embarrassed to see the number of such ''limited tax benefits'' in the bill.
7/30/1997	Disk Maker's Shares Climb On Microsoft Connection	Shares in the disk maker Nimbus CD International Inc. rose 14 percent yesterday on heavy volume after the company announced that it had signed a contract to become an authorized manufacturer of digital disks for the Microsoft Corporation. Nimbus, the largest independent compact disk manufacturer in the United States, also reported first-quarter earnings that while down sharply from a year earlier slightly exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations.
7/30/1997	MICROSOFT WILL NOT FACE NEW ANTITRUST INQUIRY BY F.T.C.	The Microsoft Corporation will not face a Federal Trade Commission antitrust inquiry, as the agency yesterday rebuffed a request from a group of senators who said the Justice Department had gone soft in its long investigation of the computer giant. The agency's chairman, Robert Pitofsky, said an antitrust investigation by the F.T.C. ''could involve a substantial duplication of effort as well as raise serious concerns about fairness to the targets and potential witnesses.'' The decision, though expected by antitrust lawyers, was a setback for the Netscape Communications Corporation, which had challenged the Justice Department either to reinvigorate its investigation of Microsoft or to turn matters over to the F.T.C. Separately, Microsoft bought a stake in Navitel Communications Inc., a closely held maker of Internet telephone software.
7/29/1997	Teasing Brains, Not Trigger Fingers	THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION has long contributed to the electronic drain on America's productivity with games like Flight Simulator, Solitaire, Minesweeper, Powerpoint and Windows Reboot. Its newest entry is Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection, a project developed largely in Russia and overseen by Alexey Pajitnov, the Moscow-born designer of the infuriatingly addictive Tetris. He now works for Microsoft. The pack, on a CD-ROM, costs about $35; it is designed for Windows 95 computers with a 486/66 processor or better and can be installed to run entirely from your hard disk if you are willing to sacrifice about 30 megabytes of it.
7/26/1997	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about a new strategy by the Microsoft Corporation rendered the company's stock market value incorrectly in a quotation from David Readerman, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, who was commenting on Microsoft's growth prospects. The value was $180 billion, not $180 million.
7/25/1997	Microsoft Freelancers Win Stock-Plan Appeal	The Microsoft Corporation lost a Federal appeals court decision today in a case brought by freelance workers who wanted to take part in the company's stock-purchase plan. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled here that Microsoft could not exclude freelance workers it had hired before 1990. Under the program, employees can use part of their pay to buy stock in Microsoft at a 15 percent discount.
7/25/1997	Microsoft, Ever Hungry, Looks for New Conquests	The Microsoft Corporation has a blunt message for the rest of the computer industry: The world's largest software publisher plans to continue expanding its empire to embrace ever-larger parts of the corporate computing and consumer electronics markets. That message, spelled out on Wednesday and again today by Microsoft executives as part of an annual two-day financial and technical briefing for reporters and analysts, comes as the software giant is mounting its most aggressive campaign yet to move beyond desktop PC's by aiming software at the business-network market and the world of digital television.
7/24/1997	In an Industry Built on Turmoil, Novell Must Struggle to Rebound	The days and cities sometimes blur for Eric Schmidt. If it is Monday, he remarked last week, it must be Atlanta. Or Nashville or Cincinnati -- the earlier stops that day. The rest of last week's itinerary: Dallas and Austin, Tex.; Santa Monica, Irvine, and San Jose, Calif., and Missoula, Mont., and back to San Jose. The road trip continues this week with stops in Chicago; Bloomington, Ill.; Memphis; Alamosa, Colo., and Boston.
7/22/1997	Microsoft Takes a Stake in Progressive Networks	Taking another small step in its multibillion-dollar push for digital television based on Internet technologies, the Microsoft Corporation made a 10 percent investment yesterday in Progressive Networks as part of an agreement to support Progressive's audio and video technical standards for the Internet. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
7/21/1997	New Service Tracks Web Use	As a second generation of Internet search tools emerges, a company called Alexa Internet has started a service offering users more information about the popularity and location of the pages they view. The service, which works with Internet browsers offered by the Netscape Communications Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation, focuses on the relatively new idea of assisting users in navigating the World Wide Web.
7/20/1997	Who Says Microsoft Stock Is Too High?	During the second quarter of this year, Microsoft's stock leaped from just over $90 a share to $126, and by last week the price had moved past $150 a share. Investors could not get enough of the stock. But Greg Maffei did not buy.
7/20/1997	Warning: These Numbers May Depress You	FORBES published its annual list of global billionaires last Monday, and in a single year Bill Gates, the world's richest businessman, more than doubled his wealth, to $36.4 billion. But even with a July 28 cover date, the magazine was already out of date. By Wednesday, Mr. Gates's fortune had soared 15 percent, to nearly $42 billion; between that morning's breakfast and coffee break alone he made more than $2 billion. On Thursday the Microsoft shares that make up most of his fortune soared again.
7/18/1997	Microsoft Profit Beats Forecasts, but Barely	The Microsoft Corporation reported yesterday that its earnings rose 89 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting strong sales of its Windows 95 operating system for personal computers and its successful drive into the corporate computing market with Windows NT, the software giant's network operating system software. The results, which were reported after the stock market closed, were slightly ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimate, but Microsoft's shares fell in after-hours trading.
7/15/1997	A Microsoft Browser Tied Tighter to Windows 95	The Microsoft Corporation plans on Tuesday to introduce a test version of its Internet software that is more closely linked to the company's Windows 95 operating system. It also plans to announce that more than 250 companies will use the product's new features to deliver entertainment and information to personal computer users.
7/6/1997	Computer Age Millionaires Redefine Philanthropy	Among the multitudes of Microsoft millionaires here, something big is brewing. Something that, though emanating from what many consider the Evil Empire of computerdom, has the potential to do such tremendous good that it reminds philanthropy experts of the turn-of-the-century transformation of New York City by the railroad and oil barons. Or the infusion of civic-minded wealth into the Ford-and-Chrysler Midwest a generation later.
7/1/1997	Computer Intruders Disrupt Microsoft Site	Twice in the last two weeks the Microsoft Corporation's World Wide Web site has been attacked by unknown computer network intruders. In the most recent instance, today, the intruders were able to deny access to the site for much of the day. On June 20, the company's Web site -- which has a particularly high profile because Microsoft is the world's largest provider of computer software -- was disrupted by electronic vandals who had found a flaw in the company's Windows NT operating system.
6/30/1997	Microsoft Wants Information To Travel the Real Highway	Eager to take advantage of the hour a day the average American spends in a car, the Microsoft Corporation has begun developing programs for dashboard-mounted computers that would allow drivers to check electronic mail, trade stocks and even surf the Internet using cellular telephone links. But Microsoft's plan, which it has code-named the Apollo Project, poses potential safety problems, say auto industry officials whom the software company approached recently. With studies already showing that cellular phone users have higher accident rates, the question is whether drivers should be offered any more distractions.
6/29/1997	The Buss About Firefly	Daniel Lyons profile of Firefly Network, a small company based in Cambridge, Mass, that is a leader in the race to develop and commercialize so-called software agents, which help a computer user navigate the World Wide Web and can over time learn his or her tastes, much like a personal shopper can, and offer useful recommendations; discusses privacy issues raised by technology as well as the huge degree to which company's profitability may depend on Microsoft Corp; Max Metral, Firefly's chief of technology, comments; photos; drawings (L)
6/29/1997	Microsoft Largess Means Computers for Elizabeth Library	Elizabeth Public Library is one of 41 in country to get grant from Microsoft's Libraries Online program, which pays for installation of high-tech computer equipment (New Jersey Briefs)
6/27/1997	Microsoft in On-Line Billing Venture	The Microsoft Corporation and the First Data Corporation said yesterday that they had formed a company that would allow consumers to pay bills over the Internet, a move aimed at speeding up the use of the global computer network for business. The joint venture, called MSFDC, would allow consumers to receive and pay bills using personal computer home banking software or through banks' sites on the World Wide Web.
6/25/1997	Netscape and Microsoft Are Cleared on Exports	In a move intended to speed up the growth of international electronic commerce, the Commerce Department granted permission today to the Netscape Communications Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation to export more secure versions of their software to banking customers. Both companies sell Internet browser programs for personal computers and server software used for financial transactions. Until now the United States Government has imposed strict limits on the strength of the encryption software that can be exported for such applications.
6/24/1997	Gates to Help Libraries Acquire Gear To Go on Line	William H. Gates, the software entrepreneur sometimes criticized for being too slow to give away his billions, is creating a foundation that intends to spend $200 million over five years to bring new computers and the Internet into the nation's public libraries. The Gates Library Foundation, whose creation is expected to be announced today, is mainly intended to help libraries in low-income areas. But as many as half of America's 16,000 public libraries may eventually receive assistance, foundation executives say.
6/23/1997	Computing Giants Join Electronic Games Show	Two years ago, Nintendo, Sega, Sony and hundreds of other video game companies abandoned the cluttered floors of huge computer trade shows, setting up the Electronic Entertainment Expo so they could train the spotlight on their own products. Now, some of the companies they left behind are joining them. This year, the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation provided the keynote speakers at the show, which ended on Saturday in Atlanta.
6/18/1997	Microsoft Picks England as Site Of Research Lab	The Microsoft Corporation, intent on building a world-class research team, has decided that it needs to be a bit more worldly. The company took a significant step in that direction yesterday when it announced that it would spend $80 million to set up a research laboratory in Cambridge, England, in collaboration with Cambridge University. The lab will be headed by Roger Needham, a Cambridge professor and a research pioneer in computer systems, and will eventually employ 40 full-time research fellows, mostly from Europe. Microsoft will also invest $16 million in a venture fund to back technology start-ups in the area.
6/17/1997	Schools to Get Software	The Microsoft Corporation plans to donate $30,000 worth of its Office 97 software to the New York City public schools as part of a new effort to get vendors at this week's PC Expo at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to leave their goods behind rather than cart them away.
6/16/1997	11 PC Makers To Introduce Stripped-Down Office Model	In its infancy, the personal computer industry made a major selling point of saying that PC's offered freedom from the arbitrary dictates of the corporate data center with its bureaucratic caretakers in white lab coats. Now, as the maturing PC industry approaches the end of its second decade, central authority is in. The biggest splash, if you can call it that, at this week's annual PC Expo trade show in New York is not ''a computer for the rest of us,'' as Apple Computer styled the Macintosh in 1984, but a stripped-down, sealed box that is tamper proof and can be controlled by corporate headquarters.
6/16/1997	Take a personal computer. Shrink it. Add a Windows operating system. Now what?	THE first generation of hand-held computing devices using software that looks and feels like the familiar Microsoft Windows operating system is now on the market, with products from seven different hardware makers. In fact many of these products will be on display this week at the PC Expo industry bazaar in Manhattan. But many analysts say that at $500 or more, the Microsoft-based gadgets so far pose no serious challenge to the popular Palm Pilot by U.S. Robotics. The reason is simple. The Palm Pilot, whose introduction last year revitalized the moribund hand-held computing market, relied on a radical idea: Stop trying to replace the personal computer and instead create a PC extension, an easy-to-use, fit-in-your-pocket device to automate the keeping of calendars, to-do lists and phone files and other workday data. And sell it for less than $300.
6/15/1997	A Bug by Any Other Name ...	''I don't know if I would use that word,'' a Microsoft support engineer said. ''What word?'' I replied innocently.
6/14/1997	Company Briefs	MICROSOFT CORP., Redmond, Wash., the software giant, acquired Cooper & Peters Inc., Boulder, Colo., a producer of framework technology for various computer languages, for an undisclosed sum. TEXTRON INC., Providence, R.I., said its Cessna Aircraft Co. unit had received a $400 million order from the closely held Executive Jet Inc., Montvale, N.J., for 50 Citation Excel aircraft. HUMASCAN INC., Cranford, N.J., said it expected the introduction of its screening device for the detection of breast disease to be delayed for four to six months.
6/12/1997	Microsoft Joins Netscape on Software Privacy	The Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that it would take the unusual step of agreeing with its archrival in the Internet market, Netscape, on a standard for privacy software. The Microsoft-Netscape collaboration is a pragmatic accommodation in response to growing public concerns about privacy on line -- worries that threaten to slow the growth of Internet commerce and possibly lead to Government regulation.
6/12/1997	Bill Gates Goes Vertical	The announcement this week that the Microsoft Corporation, the 800-pound gorilla of computer software, is buying an 11.5 percent interest in Comcast, the nation's fourth-largest cable television operator, may be one of those signal moments that realign the entire entertainment-information industry. On the face of it, William H. Gates is acquiring a stake in a powerful delivery system that may make the vaunted ''convergence'' everyone is talking about a reality. But it is what Mr. Gates finally makes of his alliance that will determine whether it is epoch-making or merely leaf-shaking.
6/10/1997	Software-Cable TV Deal Shows Shifting Plans of Media Giants	Sometimes landmark deals grow out of exhaustive strategizing and delicate negotiating. Other times, it is the luck of the seating chart. One evening six weeks ago, Brian L. Roberts, the president of Comcast, found himself next to William H. Gates, the billionaire chairman of Microsoft, at a dinner in a Seattle restaurant. When Mr. Gates grumbled to Mr. Roberts about how slowly cable TV companies were upgrading their networks to carry Internet traffic, Mr. Roberts responded with a chuckle, saying, ''Why don't you buy 5 percent of the cable industry?''
6/10/1997	The Next Act for Microsoft	For the Microsoft Corporation, money is not a problem, but finding a way to continue its remarkable trajectory of growth certainly is. Buying a $1 billion stake in the Comcast Corporation is part of Microsoft's solution to that problem -- moving beyond personal computer software to become a media company for the 21st century, combining programming, technology and distribution.
6/9/1997	Legal Situation Is Confused On Web Content Protections	While the new frontier of the World Wide Web is often compared to the Wild West, on-line businesses now are looking to the courts to impose law and order and to help protect their content. As that content becomes more valuable, the on-line entrepreneurs increasingly want to control who links to their sites, how they link and how their content is displayed -- questions that seemed largely insignificant even a year ago.
6/9/1997	Microsoft Near Deal to Acquire Cable TV Stake	In its most aggressive move beyond the software arena and into the media business, the Microsoft Corporation is nearing a deal to invest $1 billion in the Comcast Corporation, the nation's sixth-largest cable television operator, according to executives familiar with the discussions. Details of the deal remain sketchy, but whatever Microsoft's immediate goals, the move would give it a crucial foothold in controlling and distributing television programming.
6/5/1997	Microsoft Poses a Riddle For the Street	At more than $119, are Microsoft shares too expensive? Every quarter, in their post-earnings conference call with analysts, Mike Brown, the Microsoft Corporation's chief financial officer, and Greg Maffei, the treasurer, sing a medley of cautions: growth will slow; the multiple is too high; comparisons with the prior year will be tough.
6/3/1997	Microsoft Takes Aim At Web Site	What's in a name? Apparently everything when it is on the Internet. And especially when the name is Microsoft. A college student in California has been using microsoftnetwork.com as the name for his company's World Wide Web page. And the Microsoft Corporation, which became aware of the address late last week, is trying to make him stop.
6/3/1997	Study Ranks Software as No. 3 Industry	The computer software business has risen rapidly to become America's third-largest manufacturing industry, paying wages twice the national average, according to a new study. The study provides the most detailed portrait to date of the jobs and wealth generated by the fast-growing software business. The industry-sponsored research will be presented in Washington tomorrow by a group of computer executives led by Bill Gates of Microsoft and Andrew Grove of Intel.
5/20/1997	U.S. Reviews A Bid Made By Microsoft	In a sign of the Government's continuing scrutiny of the Microsoft Corporation, the Justice Department issued a formal request to the big software company last week, seeking internal documents concerning Microsoft's planned $425 million purchase of WebTV Networks Inc. The accelerated Government review of the WebTV acquisition proposal, legal experts say, could be time consuming and costly. But they noted that the stepped-up investigation -- signaled by a second request for information -- does not necessarily mean the Justice Department will challenge the planned purchase.
5/19/1997	Microsoft Set To Offer Guide To New York	Microsoft's ambitious march into the media business continues today as its on-line city guide, New York Sidewalk, goes up on the Internet. New York is the second subject of Microsoft's city guides, after Seattle, with about a dozen more across the country planned by the end of the year. And New York is where the Microsoft Corporation will find the stiffest competition -- more than a dozen local service-information sites are on line already, ranging from Net-only services like Citysearch (www.citysearch.com) to the World Wide Web versions of magazines like Timeout (www.timeout.co.uk).
5/19/1997	Microsoft Aims For Bigger Share Of Corporate Computer Sales	With a marketing blitz led by Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corporation begins its assault this week on the lucrative business of industrial-strength corporate computing. Microsoft dominates the market for personal computer software, but it has made few inroads in large-scale computing chores like handling the payrolls, manufacturing and logistical information of big companies.
5/14/1997	10 Years Later, I.B.M. Sets a New High in a Changed Market	This is a tale of how the dominant can fade, and how technology, unlike most other industries, can see huge companies shrink and smaller ones become behemoths. On a summer day nearly a decade ago, the shares of the International Business Machines Corporation, then the dominant maker of computers and by far the largest company in the country, hit a record high of $175.875. It was the only company in the land with a market value of more than $100 billion.
5/10/1997	V.I.P.'s Aplenty Flock to Bill Gates's 'Summit'	Forget Davos. Forget the Bohemian Grove Retreat. Bill Gates, the richest man in America and considered by some the most important man in the world, has put in his opening bid to become the host with the most -- the most ability to pack the most chief executives and political heavyweights into one party of his creation, that is. The Microsoft ''C.E.O. Summit,'' held here on Thursday and today, drew Vice President Al Gore, Steve Forbes and Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as well as more than 100 other V.I.P.'s representing 25 countries and a constellation of businesses and industries.
5/8/1997	Reed Deal With Microsoft	Reed Elsevier P.L.C. has signed a five-year publishing agreement worth $30 million with the Microsoft Corporation. The deal allows Reed Elsevier to use Microsoft's commercial Internet system applications for future electronic offerings in the scientific, legal, business and travel information markets. Reed Elsevier, a joint British and Dutch publishing company, owns the Lexis-Nexis on-line information service.
5/5/1997	Microsoft Took WebTV Risk, Despite Loss	Selling out to the Microsoft Corporation, truth be told, is the dream of many a high-technology start-up -- and many new ventures have done just that in recent years. Still, WebTV Networks Inc. stands in a class by itself in persuading Microsoft to invest lavishly on unproven, if promising, new technology. Last month, Microsoft agreed to pay $425 million in stock and cash for the maker of set-top boxes that bring the Internet to television sets.
5/5/1997	In Ticketmaster vs. Microsoft, it's tough to know whom to root for.	IT was practically oozing from the complaint filed in Federal court in Los Angeles last Wednesday -- the sense that if two corporate empire builders ever deserved each other in the first big legal dispute over cyberspace commerce, they are Bill Gates and Fredric D. Rosen. Mr. Gates is the chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant company in the computer software world. Mr. Rosen is the chief executive of the Ticketmaster Corporation, the dominant company in the live-event ticket world.
5/5/1997	Microsoft to Help Train Computer Workers	On another front, Microsoft over the weekend introduced a program to recruit and train computer and software professionals, saying 190,000 American jobs were unfilled for a lack of trained applicants. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said it would spend several million dollars providing training to colleges and technical institutes as well as providing half-priced training to working professionals and discounted recruiting fees for Microsoft dealers to find new employees.
4/30/1997	Microsoft Sued By Ticketmaster	Ticketmaster Group Inc. filed suit in Federal court here today accusing the Microsoft Corporation of ''electronic piracy'' for providing links to Ticketmaster's Web site from its entertainment guide on the Internet. The suit seeks to stop Microsoft from letting users hook up to the Ticketmaster site from Microsoft's ''Seattle Sidewalk'' guide. Any Internet user can look up Ticketmaster's listings and, using a personal computer, buy tickets to entertainment events. But users who hook up to the site from Microsoft's guide can make their transactions without receiving information on policies and service information offered by Ticketmaster.
4/18/1997	Microsoft Network Loses E-Mail Service	Investors in the Microsoft Corporation may have been buoyed by the company's quarterly financial results yesterday, but they could not spread the word via Microsoft's electronic mail service. That is because the 2.5 million subscribers to the Microsoft Network have been unable to send or receive E-mail since Wednesday evening -- and are unlikely to be able to before the weekend.
4/18/1997	Microsoft Says Its Earnings Jumped 85%	The Microsoft Corporation blew past Wall Street analysts' estimates yesterday, reporting an 85 percent increase in earnings and a 45 percent rise in revenues, which the company attributed primarily to strong sales of Office 97, its software suite for businesses. Although Microsoft always manages to lower Wall Street's expectations so that it can then exceed them, its performance in its second fiscal quarter was by any measure extraordinary. And Microsoft executives were at pains to say that it might not be repeatable.
4/9/1997	Dow Jones Forms Alliance With Microsoft	Dow Jones & Company said yesterday that it had formed a technology and marketing alliance with the Microsoft Corporation as part of its effort to revive Telerate, its faltering financial data division that was recently renamed Dow Jones Markets. Earlier this year, under pressure from minority shareholders upset by the poor performance of the company's stock, Dow Jones announced an ambitious plan to invest as much as $650 million over the next three to four years to overhaul the troubled unit, which has been losing market share to Reuters Holdings P.L.C. and Bloomberg L.P.
4/8/1997	VOXWARE STOCK GAINS ON NEWS OF DEAL WITH MICROSOFT	The stock of Voxware Inc. of Princeton, N.J., gained 22 percent yesterday after the Microsoft Corporation, the software giant, licensed its voice and audio compression technologies. Terms were not disclosed. Microsoft plans to embed Voxware's technologies in Microsoft Netshow 2.0, a system for broadcasting live audio, video and multimedia on the Internet and corporate computer networks. Voxware's products allow the transmission of high-quality speech and sound over computer networks. Its stock gained 87.5 cents to close at $4.875.
4/8/1997	Computer Makers Challenge Broadcasters Over TV Format	Leaders of the personal computer industry proposed their vision of the future of television today, setting them on a collision course with broadcast companies. Playing brinkmanship at an elaborately staged news conference during the National Association of Broadcasters' annual convention here, executives from the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation spelled out the technical format for the digital televisions that Compaq and other PC makers plan to include as standard equipment in all personal computers sold in the United States starting next year -- a format incompatible with the digital technology that broadcasters plan to use.
4/7/1997	Microsoft to Buy WebTV, Blending PC's, TV's and the Internet	In its most ambitious effort yet to blend the personal computer, the television and the Internet, Microsoft Corporation said today that it would spend $425 million to acquire WebTV Networks Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif. start-up company that delivers Internet information directly to television sets. The announcement, which was made this afternoon from a convention of television broadcasters in Las Vegas, Nev., is one of a series of maneuvers the software giant is making in an effort to extend its reach from the personal computer, which has found its way into almost 40 percent of American homes, to the television, which has pride of place in 98 percent of all homes in the country.
4/6/1997	Trying to Zap the Games That Workers Play	DIABLO is a role-playing computer game. Diablo Canyon is a nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo, Calif. In Gary Maier's opinion, the two should never meet. As a computer network administrator at the plant, owned by Pacific Gas and Electric, Mr. Maier wants his megabytes used for producing megawatts, and for nothing else.
3/31/1997	Heroes of a new genre seek their fortunes in the kingdom of Silicon Valley.	IT is a familiar story. The provincial hero is safe and secure, living in the midst of plenty. Then disaster strikes or restlessness sets in. Accidents happen or ambition takes over. And the hero sets out to seek his fortune. Little does he know what deception and disillusion await him. This well-worn novelistic pattern -- which once led the picaresque hero to London or Paris or even New York to test his mettle and learn his lessons -- is now making stops at Silicon Valley, a region that for now we might as well think of as a mythological kingdom. It is a world of geeks, greed and glory, where fortunes are made, temptations offered and souls sold. It is also a land where good computer code is king.
3/24/1997	A public terminal akin to a teller machine to gain access to a modem and an on-line service.	THE Internet may be coming to a pay phone near you. Richard Mettke has won a patent for a public terminal that lets a user swipe a credit card through a port to gain access to a modem and connect to an on-line service.
3/12/1997	Microsoft in Plan On Internet Browser	The Microsoft Corporation and more than 30 software development and publishing companies said yesterday that they would share technology developed for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 browser, permitting the broadcast of ''channels'' of data over the Internet. Microsoft said it had agreements with a number of developers of software for the delivery of content, including Air Media, Pointcast, First Floor and Back Web. These companies have agreed to support a number of Microsoft standards for displaying information in its Internet Explorer 4.0 browser. The program will be available in a demonstration version this month and is to be released in the summer.
3/11/1997	Potpourri for Home or Office Use	SOFTWARE suites, collections of major programs sold together, have been the rage for the last few years. For less than the total price of the components purchased separately, you get a top-of-the-line word processor, spreadsheet, database and other programs. The collections make sense for large offices, although it is difficult to imagine one person mastering Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and Powerpoint, to pick examples from the Microsoft Office suite. For small offices, home offices or plain homes, integrated programs like Microsoft Works or Clarisworks make more sense.
3/10/1997	Netscape Designs Software For a Corporate Niche	The Netscape Communications Corporation said it planned to announce Monday a third generation of its software intended to compete with the Microsoft Corporation and intensify Netscape's focus on the corporate marketplace. Netscape executives said that the company was adopting a new focus on what it called ''extranets'' -- private Internet connections between companies that may be business partners or that have supplier-consumer relationships.
3/10/1997	Many Doors To Microsoft's New Windows	If Microsoft were a painter putting oil to canvas, instead of a software designer placing buttons, icons and menus on a computer screen, 1997 might well be remembered as the inception of the company's baroque period. On Tuesday the nation's largest software publisher plans to announce plans for releasing a test copy of the newest version of its Internet Explorer program for browsing the World Wide Web.
3/9/1997	When Big Brother Is a Librarian	THE communications revolution traces its origins to the sixth century, when European monks began copying early Christian literature from papyrus to parchment to preserve their ancient heritage. Today computer scientists, librarians, archivists, intellectual property lawyers and even privacy activists are struggling with a similar challenge: saving the burgeoning digital universe of the World Wide Web for future generations. But it is there that the similarities between monks and Web archivists end.
2/25/1997	Updating Some Kid Stuff for Serious Children	MICROSOFT Plus is a companion collection of programs that did not make it into Windows 95 for one reason or another, like Desktop Themes, with striking illustrations and icons; Drivespace 3, an improved compression agent, and 3D Pinball, which a couple of weeks ago I mistakenly said came with Windows 95. New this week is Microsoft Plus for Kids, with features aimed at the 3-to-12-year-old set, and an additional feature to ease parental concerns. The program should be widely available for less than $25. First, the kid stuff.
2/20/1997	On-Line Guide Agreement	Microsoft and The Village Voice have agreed to exchange information to help their respective on-line guides to New York City, the companies announced yesterday. Under the content licensing agreement, The Voice will provide New York event listings to Microsoft's New York Sidewalk entertainment guide, expected to begin in April. Microsoft, in turn, will offer technological expertise to expand the breadth of The Voice's on-line guide.
2/20/1997	Microsoft Taking a Stake in Video Games	Microsoft said today that it had taken a minority stake in Digital Anvil, an interactive software gaming company formed by Chris Roberts, formerly of Electronic Arts Inc. A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to identify the size of the investment in the video-game company.
2/19/1997	Spinoff From Digital to Make Software Tools	The Digital Equipment Corporation plans to announce today that it is setting up an independent company, Tracepoint Technology Inc. to produce software development tools. The tools will be used to produce programs for computers using the Intel Corporation's Pentium microprocessors and the Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems. Software development tools allow programmers to write more efficient applications, more rapidly, than they can using only programming languages. Tracepoint's tools are based on the C and C++ languages developed by AT&T.
2/17/1997	And the winner of the 'Worst Software Patent of the Year' is, hmm, a certain William H. Gates.	GREGORY AHARONIAN, the curmudgeonly editor of the Internet Patent News Service, will officially announce his annual ''Worst Software Patent of the Year'' award today. The winner for 1996 is number 5,552,982, a ''method and system for processing fields in a document processor.'' The inventor? William H. Gates 3d, better known as Bill Gates, chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation. Peter C. Jackson and Bryan Loofbourrow, of Seattle, are also listed as inventors. The patent itself is assigned to Microsoft.
2/13/1997	Microsoft Notified Of Texas Inquiry	The Microsoft Corporation, which has fought a series of Federal antitrust investigations, now faces an inquiry by Texas state officials into its Internet products. While Texas may not individually present a serious danger to the software-industry leader, antitrust lawyers say the state investigation could ratchet up the pressure on the United States Justice Department to take action in its investigation.
2/9/1997	A Shortage of Terminals Spells Computer Access Denied	Ed Powell groaned when he saw a police officer escorting a teen-ager he knew out of the Flatbush branch of the Brooklyn Public Library in December. Mr. Powell, whose Umma Group Inc. organizes civilian anticrime patrols in the neighborhood, knew that the young man had once worked as a look-out for a major drug dealer. He could only imagine what the teen-ager was up to. But when Mr. Powell got him into his car for a talk, he was stunned by the teen-ager's explanation. ''It wasn't about drugs,'' Mr. Powell later recalled with a laugh. The teen-ager, he said, was angry because he could not get access to a computer.
2/9/1997	Intel, Everywhere Intel: Why Portfolios Look the Same	GREAT minds think alike. Perhaps that explains why Intel, General Electric, Philip Morris, Cisco Systems and Microsoft pop up over and over again in mutual fund portfolios. Then again, perhaps it's simply a matter of ''like'' minds.
2/4/1997	Far From Quiet on the Computer Game Front	LET'S play a game. Almost everyone plays games on the computer. Indeed, game playing can turn into the main occupation of a home computer user, after the initial pious vow to balance the budget or book hotel rooms is forgotten. At the office, of course, we are much too dedicated to play. Besides, few games now come with a ''boss'' key, one that instantly replaces the game screen with something that looks vaguely productive if Mr. Dithers wanders by.
2/4/1997	The New MSN as Prehistoric TV	FRUSTRATED with America Online? Perhaps you would prefer a competitor whose installation plays a tune with the incisive lyric ''Just too stupid to stop!'' The Microsoft Network on-line service arrived with Windows 95, amid much blather about its supposedly simple interface. Times change. ''MSN was probably the worst of the bunch in terms of ease of use,'' Laura Jennings, the service's vice president, admitted last October. ''We had adopted the Windows 95 interface religiously.''
1/27/1997	Computer software to recognize and sensibly render human speech.	THOSE who have long believed that the computer will automate humans out of readin' and writin' as efficiently as it has with 'rithmetic may finally have a little something to worry about. Earlier this month, at the Macworld Expo, Apple Computer Inc. demonstrated a document summarizer, still in its research labs, that boiled down an essay to a single sentence, one that made the essay's key point.
1/23/1997	Microsoft's Muppet Deal	The Microsoft Corporation said today that Jim Henson Production Inc. had agreed to jointly develop interactive programming featuring the Muppets for Microsoft's on-line network, MSN. Financial terms for the three-year development deal were not disclosed. The companies expect the first set of shows to be introduced this summer. MSN offers information, entertainment and communications on the Internet. Jim Henson Productions, based here, is a film, television and video production company.
1/22/1997	Microsoft Goes to Manhattan in Search of Countercultural Cool	Microsoft is a corporate behemoth with 20,000 workers famous for their Dockers office wear and their cool rationality, whether analyzing a line of computer code or a marketing plan. Silicon Alley is the name given to the confluence of hundreds of small companies staffed by creative young people drawn to New York City. In Manhattan lofts where once they might have formed little magazines or rock-and-roll bands, today they are putting up Web sites.
1/21/1997	Netscape Takes On Rivals in KPMG Deal  	In its effort to prove itself a viable competitor in the corporate computer-networking market, the Netscape Communications Corporation is expected to announce today that the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick L.L.P. has selected the newest version of Netscape's business communications software as the standard for 17,000 workers in its 120 offices in the United States. The deal is an important endorsement for Netscape, which made its name with software for browsing the World Wide Web but is trying to challenge both the Microsoft Corporation and the Lotus Development unit of I.B.M. as the leading supplier of messaging software to businesses and institutions.
1/19/1997	Don't Punish Microsoft For Its Brand of Competition	Article by Dominick T Armento, profesor emeritus of economics at University of Hartford, says Microsoft Corp is again under antitrust investigation by Justice Department for offering discounts for its Windows 95 operating system to personal computer makers that promise to give its Internet Software prominence over similar products from its competitors; notes Microsoft is aiming to expand its market share by lowering prices and sweetening overall terms to potential customers, which is explicitly competitve behavior and counter to monopolistic practices used by other companies; calls Government's long-running campaign against Microsoft sadly reminiscent of antitrust policies of 1950's and 1960's, when antitrust was routinely employed to restrict competition (M)
1/19/1997	Wall Street Meets Main Street, Not Far From Chicago	THE 87,000 residents of Elgin, Ill., are about to get a 10-month, $2 million course in personal finance, compliments of Money magazine, with some help from Fidelity Investments, the Nasdaq stock market and Microsoft. The project -- whose goal is to raise the ''financial I.Q.'' of Elgin residents -- is part of the magazine's run-up to its 25th anniversary issue in October. The events will begin on Jan. 29 with an introductory session for the entire town that will feature former President George Bush. Highlights in coming months will include:
1/18/1997	Microsoft's Earnings Top Wall St. Expectations	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday reported second-quarter earnings that far exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations. But the software giant also said that its growth could slow in the 1998 fiscal year. Investors have grown accustomed to such cautionary remarks from Microsoft, which often seem calculated to allow the company to maintain its record of underpromising so that it can overdeliver. Microsoft reported its results after the market's close, but in after-hours trading, Microsoft shares rose $1.875 each, to $89, after gaining $1.125, to $87.125, in Nasdaq trading.
1/14/1997	An Upgraded Leviathan Sets Sail	BATTEN down the hard drive! Microsoft Office 97 will officially arrive on Thursday with a bag of new features even bigger than the usual upgrade. Many are useful and potentially important, like a cornucopia of options involving hypertext and the Internet. But pesky cartoon critters descended from the late and unlamented Microsoft Bob get in the way. To accommodate the improvements, Microsoft has adopted an entirely new set of file formats that older versions of Office and other programs cannot read. The likely upshot? A nationwide blizzard of E-mail and phone calls involving variants of the question, ''How come I can't open that file you just sent me?'' Although workarounds are available, the New Look files are bound to produce some unpleasant fallout, as I found out at 30,000 feet after transferring one to my laptop machine running Office 95.
1/13/1997	Microsoft Set for Another Move In Forging Links to the Internet	Bill Gates of Microsoft will take the stage of Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center in Manhattan on Thursday to introduce Office 97, the new version of the company's software bundle for office computing. But the real star of the show, analysts say, will probably be a new application, Outlook, that is joining such popular programs as Word and Excel. Outlook, analysts say, shows the progress the Microsoft Corporation has made in linking its traditional products with the Internet, a crucial element in the company's effort to keep sales rising rapidly. The new application, they add, also represents Microsoft's bid to best rivals like I.B.M. and Netscape Communications in the fast-growing market for programs that let employees work in collaborative groups.
1/13/1997	Microsoft's On-Line Magazine to Be Free	''Information wants to be free,'' the editors of the on-line magazine Slate conceded on Saturday. And therefore, so will Slate. The Microsoft Corporation's effort to bring polished political and cultural commentary to the World Wide Web was supposed to become the cyberworld's first subscription publication that had nothing to do with money, sports or sex. Slate had said it would begin charging $19.95 a year beginning in November, then pushed the deadline back to February, and on Saturday announced, as the headline put it, 'Slate Chickens Out.'
1/12/1997	Creating Jobs	On a soft november day in northern california, steve jobs is guiding his gray Porsche convertible out of San Francisco, and he is talking about Apple Computer Inc. That, of course, is what Jobs is famous for: as a co-founder of Apple in 1976, he was a leader of the computer revolution, until he was ousted in 1985 in a board-room coup. Jobs was 30, and he walked away with $150 million but no small measure of hurt. As he negotiates the Friday afternoon traffic on Route 101, Jobs keeps insisting that he does not want to talk about Apple. Then he goes on at length about how the company needs to reinvent itself, how it needs to regain its lost mantle as the personal computer industry's leading innovator. He is intimate but elusive, and undeniably articulate. He recalls his years at Apple fondly, then makes it clear that he is doing nothing more than reminiscing. After all, he has other things to worry about, like running Pixar, the digital-animation studio that created ''Toy Story,'' and overseeing Next, the computer-software company he started when he left Apple.
12/31/1996	If Directx Simplifies, Confusion May Result	YOU just want to pop a beer and a Martian or two. Instead you must answer incomprehensible questions about ''drivers that have not been certified,'' after which you discover your Windows 95 machine does not work quite the way it used to. That kind of thing can happen all too easily with Directx, a Microsoft Corporation technology devised to help developers create games for the fat but fancy new Windows 95 system without sacrificing the performance they got from the lean but ugly old DOS. Special Directx software drivers manage video, audio, joysticks and other hardware, eliminating the need for games to communicate directly with dozens of different devices and making program installation a snap.
12/30/1996	Burnett Units Gain 3 Accounts	Three overseas offices of the Leo Burnett Company have been awarded assignments with combined billings estimated at more than $20 million. Hallmark Cards Ltd. in Henley on Themes, England, named the London office of Burnett to handle an undisclosed marketing project, which had been handled in-house.
12/23/1996	Why Apple Sees Next as a Match Made in Heaven	Sometimes breaking the rules works best. Despite her reputation as a stuffy corporate manager, Apple Computer's chief technical officer, Ellen Hancock, picked up the telephone in mid-November and returned a call from an unknown marketing manager at Next Software Inc.
12/15/1996	More Basic Research	The Microsoft Corporation flexed its muscles last week when it said it plans to triple its basic research spending in 1997. The Redmond, Wash., software giant made the move in part to make a statement about what its executives worry is a trend toward declining basic corporate research in the United States.
12/12/1996	Microsoft and Pointcast in Broadcast Alliance	Heading off what could have been a protracted battle for a new generation of Internet ''viewers,'' the Microsoft Corporation and Pointcast Inc. announced a broad alliance yesterday in the fast-growing area known as Internet broadcasting. Under the deal, Pointcast, which offers a service that automatically sends customized information over the Internet to subscribers' PC's, will embrace Microsoft technology and distribute information produced by the MSNBC news service owned jointly by Microsoft and NBC. In exchange, Pointcast is to receive a featured position in the next version of Microsoft's operating system software for PC's. That alone could help Pointcast reach millions of new customers, Christopher R. Hassett, the company's chief executive, said. More than 1.7 million people have downloaded the Pointcast software since the company introduced its advertiser-supported Pointcast Network earlier this year. The computer network, which the company said receives more than 40 million hits a day, includes multiple services -- which Pointcast calls channels -- like stock quotes, weather forecasts and articles from newspapers including The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times. The success of Pointcast, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., has inspired dozens of other companies to offer ''push'' technology or services that enable subscribers to regularly receive customized information over the Internet, avoiding nettlesome searches and long waits. Microsoft also endorsed the Internet broadcasting concept, saying earlier this year that it would integrate the next version of Internet Explorer, its World Wide Web browsing software, into its Windows 95 operating system software and add a function in which numerous Internet channels could be viewed directly from the Windows 95 user interface or ''desktop.'' That announcement had appeared to set Microsoft and Pointcast on a collision course. But yesterday, Microsoft said that it would feature the Pointcast Network as a ''premier'' channel on what it called its Active Desktop, when the software is released in mid-1997. In exchange, Pointcast agreed to integrate Internet Explorer into the next version of the software that it distributes and to use Microsoft technology to develop animated and interactive design features for the Pointcast Network. Pointcast also said that it would carry MSNBC as a channel on its network. The agreement is a potential blow to the Netscape Communications Corporation, which dominates the market for browser software but has been losing ground to Microsoft. Most Pointcast users now use Netscape's Navigator browser when they want to look at a site on the Internet. That could change soon. Netscape has its own plans to incorporate broadcast capability into its next-generation software, which it calls Constellation. But Alex Edelstein, group product manager in charge of Constellation and Navigator, said that yesterday's announcement was not a major setback and that a Netscape deal with Pointcast was not out of the question. ''Nothing has been ruled out,'' he said. ''Pointcast has lots of competitors who are beating down our door trying to be part of Constellation.''
12/11/1996	Alliance Formed Around Sun's Java Network	In a show of strength intended to rally Internet software developers around its Java programming language, the Javasoft division of Sun Microsystems Inc. said yesterday that more than 100 companies -- with the conspicuous exception of the Microsoft Corporation -- were agreeing to more closely adhere to the rules set by Sun on Java network applications. A senior Microsoft executive said last night that to the best of his knowledge, Microsoft had not been invited to join the group.
12/10/1996	Computing Through a Glass Darkly	NEW hand-held computers based on an operating system called Microsoft Windows C. E. are small enough to stuff in a Christmas stocking. After using one, you may want to stuff it back on the shelf. This latest attempt to cram a full-fledged computer into an address-book-size package shows promise, but its first incarnations show little improvement over their many predecessors. A bandwagon of sorts has been rolling nonetheless. Handheld PC's with minor differences are now available, or soon will be, under the labels of Compaq, Hitachi, LG Electronics, N.E.C. and Philips.
12/10/1996	Shift Planned In Network By Microsoft	After a complete face lift, some major surgery to fix structural flaws and some introspection about what it wants to be when it grows up, the Microsoft Network is expected to re-emerge today as an aggressive contender for the No. 2 spot in the consumer on-line information industry. Microsoft, hoping by mid-1997 to become second only to America Online in terms of customers, has decided that true subscriber growth will require venturing beyond the digerati and the Internet savvy to embrace a broader mass market more closely resembling the nation's television audience. And so, the new MSN will look and feel a lot more like television -- for better or worse, in the view of some Internet analysts.
12/9/1996	Microsoft Plans 300% Increase in Spending for Basic Research in 1997	Defying a trend away from unfettered corporate scientific research, the Microsoft Corporation plans to increase spending for basic research by 300 percent in 1997. The increase, which will create the world's largest computer science laboratory within the next two years, comes at a time when other computer research giants notably Bell Laboratories, are generally cutting back on fundamental research and focusing more on practical, product-oriented projects.
12/2/1996	As microprocessor speeds head skyward, what products will follow?	THE people who pioneer each new generation of computing technology have not traditionally been the same people who invent the next generation beyond it. That is the wonderful irony underlying the continuing intramural computer industry squabble over the controversial Network Computer. While computer industry executives bicker over whether the computer of the future will come with or without a disk drive, much more profound changes are upon us.
11/28/1996	Filling Potholes In 'Road Ahead'	IN the techno-future foreseen by Bill Gates, people will have no need to carry money, identification or a watch. They will use a wallet PC, a hand-held computer that stores digital cash and information. These quotidian encumbrances are already obsolete for Mr. Gates. When he wanted to know what time it was during breakfast the other day, he asked an aide, and the aide looked at his watch. After Mr. Gates finished his meal at Sarabeth's on the Upper East Side, the aide, a member of Microsoft's press office, pulled out a gold card and signed for the check.
11/27/1996	Pepsi's holiday-season campaign has promotions with Microsoft and an elf with attitude.	DRINK Pepsi, get software. That's the idea behind a new $20 million promotional campaign that has Pepsi-Cola teaming up with the Microsoft Corporation this holiday season.
11/25/1996	A New Language Is Adding Depth to the Flat Computer Screen	As new business uses for the Internet erupt, the lusterless, two-dimensional computer desktop display is rapidly giving way to a richer, three-dimensional representation that can be simultaneously viewed by dozens or even hundreds of computer users. Electronic shopping malls, real estate tours, businesses, political groups and even professional sports teams are rushing to virtual reality. Science fiction novels like Vernor Vinge's ''True Names,'' William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Neal Stephenson's ''Snow Crash'' introduced the original vision of a shared computerized world, called ''cyberspace'' by Mr. Gibson and the ''metaverse'' by Mr. Stephenson. Beginning in the 1980's, that vision captured the imagination of a generation of computer network designers.
11/18/1996	Microsoft Sees Big Internet Loss	Microsoft says it will probably lose more than $1 billion over the next three years on its Internet and news services before they broke even. Last week, Steven A. Ballmer, an executive vice president, forecast a loss of $300 million to $400 million in the coming year for on-line ventures and deficits of that size or slightly less for two years after that.
11/18/1996	The Hand-Held Computer Is Introduced Once Again	Ever since John Sculley, Apple Computer Inc.'s former chairman, coined the term personal digital assistant to describe a new breed of hand-held computers that he promised would revolutionize modern society, the computer industry has been struggling to live up to Mr. Sculley's vision. Yet despite expensive failures like the original Apple Newton, the Sony Magiclink and the AT&T EO, several computer and electronics manufacturers are once again betting that they will be able to break Mr. Sculley's spell. This time the strategy is to lower expectations and to place themselves in the embrace of the software industry's 10,000-pound gorilla: the Microsoft Corporation.
11/18/1996	Apple Software Leader Quits; New Questions for Company	The executive in charge of Apple Computer's troubled operating systems division for the last two years resigned Friday, raising new questions about the company's ability to sort out its problems and differentiate its Macintosh operating system from Microsoft's Windows 95 program. Isaac Nassi, a veteran computer researcher, came to Apple seven and a half years ago to direct a research project at an Apple laboratory in Cambridge, Mass. He has headed the Applesoft Division for the last two years, during which the Microsoft Corporation has, in the eyes of many executives, closed a software gap where Apple had led commandingly.
11/17/1996	CYBERSCOUT	BILL GATES EXPRESS Microsoft Expedia http://expedia.msn.com/
11/15/1996	MICROSOFT AND TCI END A PARTNERSHIP	The Microsoft Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc. have severed the partnership agreement that gave TCI, one of the nation's largest cable-television operators, a 20 percent stake in Microsoft's on-line service. Microsoft in October returned the $125 million investment that a TCI unit made in the Microsoft Network, according to a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the filing, Microsoft attributed the break in the partnership to the evolving nature of the on-line industry.
11/13/1996	Interval Research Is Planning To Spin Off 3 Software Units	The Interval Research Corporation, the secretive computer organization created four years ago by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, plans to announce three spinoffs on Wednesday. The start-up companies would be the first attempts at a market payoff from Mr. Allen's $100 million investment in Interval, which he set up to seek fresh approaches to computer-industry product development.
11/6/1996	High-Tech Fraternity	It's not a glass house, but it might as well be considering how many people have come to peer into the new high-tech home of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity at Washington State University. ''We're going to start asking for a donation of 25 cents to the March of Dimes when people want a tour,'' said Philip Hauck, the fraternity's president.
11/4/1996	Microsoft has failed to apply its own success formula to interactive media.	OF the Microsoft Corporation's grip on the software industry is roughly equivalent to the Kremlin's control over the former Soviet Union -- so great that the world scrambles to decode every ceremonial hiccup -- then the industry's Kremlinologists should take note of the subtext in the revamping that the company announced last week. That subtext concerned Microsoft's huge investments in interactive media, a growing genre of products, viewed on a PC, that includes video games, CD-ROM's and World Wide Web sites. What grabbed most of the headlines was the announcement that Patty Stonesifer, senior vice president of the interactive media division and Microsoft's only top-ranking female executive, was leaving the company.
11/3/1996	WHAT WILL GATES GIVE?	So billionaires would be more inclined to give to charity if there were a list published of who did the giving. Thank God, the vast majority of society doesn't feel the same way and is content to help others altruistically. CHRISTINE NICKELS Washington
11/3/1996	WHAT WILL GATES GIVE?	For years I've daydreamed that if I were Bill Gates, I would use my wealth to put a Windows-based PC on the desk of every child in America (The Capitalist: ''What Will Gates Give?'' by Michael Lewis, Oct. 13). Not only would this ''philanthropy'' create an entire nation of Windows users, but the early exposure to computers would also nurture the next generation of programmers, whom I could then hire to create the software that would make my next $18.5 billion. EMILY MANHART Minneapolis
11/3/1996	WHAT WILL GATES GIVE?	I applaud Lewis for his witty acknowledgment of the example that Bill Gates is or isn't setting and the questionable state of philanthropy this highlights. However, I take great exception to Lewis's classification of the professionals who run charities as ''well-meaning people who have no clue how to handle money and little practical idea about how to get their way in the world.'' The not-for-profit community is expert at handling money and savvy in the ways of the world. We must be on our toes because most of our universities, hospitals, socialservice agencies and cultural organizations are woefully underfinanced. We have to make swift business decisions and watch the bottom line continuously. BRIAN SABER Chicago Midwest Director of Development Brandeis University
10/30/1996	Top Woman At Microsoft To Leave Soon	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that Patty Stonesifer, its highest ranking woman, had resigned as part of a shake-up that will centralize power in the hands of Paul Maritz, the executive who has guided the company's operating systems business. Ms. Stonesifer has been senior vice president for the company's interactive media division, and has served on the board of Dreamworks SKG as part of Microsoft's investment in the Hollywood company. Dreamworks said yesterday that it had hired Ms. Stonesifer as a special consultant, effective early next year.
10/30/1996	Gates of Microsoft Gives $15 Million to Harvard	Bill Gates, the founder and chief executive of Microsoft, who has been criticized for saying it would be years -- even decades -- before he started giving away his billions, yesterday announced his fifth multimillion gift to a university: $15 million to Harvard for computer science and engineering programs. Mr. Gates dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year to start what has become one of the world's largest technology companies. This is his first major gift to the university.
10/29/1996	Sun Offers Lower-Cost Computer for Networking	The effort to convince corporate America that the cost of computing can be drastically reduced will begin in earnest today, as Sun Microsystems Inc. announces its strategy for the so-called network computer. The network computer is being marketed as a low-cost alternative to the personal computer. Sun's entry, called the Javastation, is priced at $742 for a basic model, and $995 with a computer keyboard, mouse and 14-inch color monitor. Later this week, the Oracle Corporation is expected to announce its network computer products. They join the International Business Machines Corporation, which announced its network computer last month.
10/29/1996	Microsoft And Intel Shift PC Strategy to Meet Network Threat	Hoping to blunt potential competition from the emerging ''network computer'' standard endorsed by Sun Microsystems, Oracle, I.B.M. and others, the powerful PC axis of Microsoft and Intel announced a strategy today to reduce the cost of owning and using personal computers. The Microsoft-Intel move marks a shift for the two companies, which in the past had derided the notion of a low-cost network computer, or NC, but now seem to recognize the importance of offering an alternative to it.
10/28/1996	An Oracle-Netscape Tie-In Will Seek to Curb Microsoft	Oracle and Netscape Communications plan on Monday to endorse each other's flagship products, with the aim of building a broad alliance intended to counter the attempt by Microsoft to become the dominant Internet software company. The alliance represents an abrupt turnaround from remarks Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chairman, was reported to have made in Europe recently. The flamboyant executive was quoted as suggesting that Netscape, the leader in Internet browsing software, would not be in business for long.
10/22/1996	TV Screen Opens Onto Internet	MICROSOFT recently demonstrated a redesigned version of its Microsoft Network (MSN) on-line information service, one that transforms the computer network into something strikingly like a television network. At about the same time, WebTV Networks redesigned my television screen to resemble an Internet computer more closely, including a World Wide Web browser, full Internet access and electronic mail. WebTV is the Internet without a personal computer, using a regular television set and a phone line.
10/22/1996	Microsoft Proves Even Stronger Than Wall Street Had Expected	In a year when it has remapped its business future to cope with the explosive growth of the Internet, the Microsoft Corporation is getting plenty of mileage from its traditional market, reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings yesterday that beat the estimates of Wall Street analysts. Microsoft typically manages Wall Street expectations so as to be able to exceed earnings forecasts. But the fact that it did so this time -- posting per-share profit of 95 cents, compared with a First Call consensus of 90 cents -- looked all the stronger, because revenue and profit both exceeded the results of the comparable period a year earlier. In the year-earlier quarter, the company's Windows 95 operating system was introduced with a marketing fanfare previously unseen in the computer industry.
10/21/1996	Slate Delays Fee for Readers	Slate, the Microsoft Corporation's on-line magazine of political commentary, has decided to delay charging its readers a subscription fee for another three months. Slate announced the move on its World Wide Web site last week in a note to readers from the editor, Michael Kinsley. Slate began publication on the Web in June. It had planned to charge readers $19.95 a year, beginning Nov. 1. But the free period will be extended until February because Microsoft has been unable to develop a workable on-line billing system, Rogers Weed, Slate's publisher, said.
10/17/1996	STOCK PLUNGES ON CONCERN ABOUT NEW COMPETITION	The shares of Sun Microsystems Inc. fell almost 10 percent yesterday on worry that new work station computers from rivals using Intel chips and Microsoft software will cut into Sun's sales and earnings. Sun, which holds 45 percent of the work station market, bases its computers on its own technology. Its stock fell $6.875, to $63.125, in Nasdaq trading of 18 million shares. Late on Tuesday, Sun reported a 46 percent rise in profits, slightly better than expected. But analysts noted that Intel's results earlier this week beat the most optimistic forecasts. ''Sun didn't beat expectations strongly enough,'' said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Furman Selz Inc., who removed the stock from the ''recommended'' list. Other analysts also downgraded the stock.
10/16/1996	Netscape Taking On Lotus With New Corporate System	The Netscape Communications Corporation announced a strategy yesterday of sidestepping the Microsoft's Corporation's assault on the Internet browser software market and competing directly against the I.B.M. Corporation's Lotus unit in the growing market for what is known as groupware. The Netscape strategy, which would be supported by new products, is a kind of coming-of-age process for the company, analysts say. Founded two years ago, Netscape was giving away samples of its browser and was unsure where it might make money, but now it is firmly focused on selling to mainstream corporate customers.
10/14/1996	New Data Standard May Help Speed Up Video on Internet	A coalition of 38 computer makers and software publishers led by the Netscape Communications Corporation and Progressive Networks Inc. plans to announce a new audio and video data standard Monday that will permit companies using the Internet to compete more directly with radio and television broadcasters. The group includes the I.B.M. Corporation, Apple Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., the Digital Equipment Corporation, the Hewlett-Packard Company and Silicon Graphics Inc., but not the Microsoft Corporation. They are backing a single standard that will allow Internet publishers to broadcast streams of digital information to users of personal computers.
10/13/1996	Mr. Gates's Public Gift	Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corporation and reputedly the richest man in America, has said he plans to donate more to charity than before. Last week, he indicated the pattern of the giving: public libraries.
10/12/1996	Court Decides Microsoft Owes Some Benefits To Freelancers	In a decision that could make it harder for companies to treat workers as independent contractors, a Federal appeals court has ordered the Microsoft Corporation to pay employee benefits to hundreds of workers who, the court found, were regular employees and not independent contractors, as Microsoft insisted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco looked to rulings of the Internal Revenue Service and payroll records to conclude that the workers were not contractors, but regular employees, and thus entitled to participate in Microsoft's 401(k) plan and buy the company's shares at a discount just like other employees.
10/10/1996	Microsoft Is Detailing Plans For Its Assault on Internet	It was in a speech on Pearl Harbor Day last December, that Bill Gates of Microsoft pointed to charts outlining his company's strategy for gaining a beachhead in the rapidly growing Internet market. Portraying Microsoft in the uncharacteristic role of an underdog, Mr. Gates singled out targets that included Netscape Communications, America Online, the Lotus division of I.B.M. and assorted Unix software companies. Ten months later, Microsoft holds much more than an Internet beachhead. And on Thursday, Mr. Gates is expected to disclose details of Microsoft's latest battle plan for dominating the Internet.
10/9/1996	Browser Moves By Microsoft Make Even Netscape Blink	Less than a year after turning its sights on the Internet upstart Netscape Communications, the Microsoft Corporation appears to be gaining the upper hand in the so-called Web browser war. Even Netscape's chief executive, James Barksdale, seemed to retreat to higher ground here today, as he and Microsoft's chief, William H. Gates, squared off before an audience of 5,000 corporate information technology managers.
10/9/1996	Support for Rural and Inner-City Libraries	Bill Gates of the Microsoft Corporation, taking a page from Andrew Carnegie's drive to help build public libraries across America during the age of steel, is to announce today a program to help connect some of those libraries to the information age. The program, in which Microsoft will supply $10.5 million in computers, software and technical support to rural and inner-city library systems, will begin in New York City at a ceremony with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at the Brooklyn Public Library's main branch.
10/8/1996	Changes in Focus Ruled Out by Apple	The chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., Gilbert Amelio, said today that the company planned to focus on making personal computers and shrugged off suggestions that its machines could not compete with ones run on operating systems made by the Microsoft Corporation. ''We have to offer a very distinct choice,'' Mr. Amelio said at a panel discussion of executives of high-technology companies at a conference in Lake Buena Vista. ''Our focus has been and will continue to be on the end user and not the people in between.'' The conference was sponsored by Gartner Group.
10/7/1996	Microsoft Pushing To Alter Standard For Digital TV	A last-minute lobbying push by the Microsoft Corporation, seeking to block or modify the planned technical standards for the next generation of television, has goaded members of the Federal Communications Commission into a search for a way to accommodate the software giant and its computer-industry allies. While the compromise most likely to emerge from Microsoft's efforts could be no more than a promise to re-evaluate the standards after a fixed number of years, the lobbying effort -- by a $6 billion company with a reputation for take-no-prisoners competitiveness -- has been watched with a mixture of fascination and anger by the parties on the other side of the dispute.
9/28/1996	Microsoft Forecasts That Its Performance for Year May Weaken	The Microsoft Corporation warned yesterday that operating margins might narrow in the 1997 fiscal year from levels a year ago because of slower revenue growth and higher operating expenses. The company also expects 1997 spending on research and development to be higher than the previous year's level. At the same time, the revenue growth rate in the first two quarters of 1997 may not be as high as in 1996, when earnings were lifted by sales of its Windows 95 operating system, the company said in a filing about earnings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
9/25/1996	I.B.M. Introducing Merlin, Its Latest OS/2 Software	I.B.M. plans today to introduce the latest version of its OS/2 software, code-named Merlin. But even I.B.M. executives concede that the new program lacks the legerdemain to make Windows, the much more popular software from the Microsoft Corporation, disappear. Indeed, after spending millions on marketing and advertising in an unsuccessful attempt to go head to head with Microsoft two years ago, the International Business Machines Corporation now has much more modest expectations for OS/2, which, like Windows, controls the basic operations of a personal computer.
9/20/1996	Justice Dept. In New Inquiry Into Microsoft	The Justice Department is opening a new phase of its long-running investigation of the Microsoft Corporation by examining the company's sales practices in the fast-growing market for the software used to browse the Internet. Microsoft issued a brief statement yesterday saying that the Justice Department had notified the company that it would receive ''a written request for information'' from the department's antitrust division.
9/17/1996	Motorola Introducing PC's With Apple System	Motorola plans today to introduce a line of personal computers equipped with Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh operating system, as the companies bid to expand the market for such machines at a time when it is threatened by I.B.M.-compatible computers running Microsoft Windows software. The new line, called Starmax, will be priced from $1,600 to $4,000 and aimed at business customers.
9/16/1996	Lotus Gears Up To Get a Slice Of Internet Pie	Colleen Griffiths, a product developer at the Lotus Development Corporation, had to suppress a laugh recently when an executive at a large bank asked her why he should risk his business on new Lotus Internet software when he could choose ''mature technology'' from the two-year-old Netscape Communications Corporation. Less than a year ago, Ms. Griffiths and her Lotus colleagues were combating the widespread perception that Internet software from fledgling companies like Netscape had made Lotus's 10-year-old Notes software obsolete. Now, as she demonstrates Domino, a new Internet version of Notes, she has been confronted with the view that the Lotus software is untested.
9/16/1996	The Browser Duel	An old-fashioned marketing war has broken out in the new and rapidly expanding world of Internet software. Individual computer users could be big winners. Microsoft, the computer software giant, is trying to dislodge a smaller company, Netscape, from its dominant position in the market for browsers, the specialized software tool needed to surf the World Wide Web. The two companies are now aggressively wooing potential consumers with rapid product improvements and rival offers of free on-line subscriptions. For the moment, computer owners do not really have to choose at all. If they have enough disk space, they can take advantage of the special features of both companies' browsers.
9/10/1996	I.B.M. and Big Banks in Home Service Deal	I.B.M. and a group of big banks said yesterday that they had formed a venture that the banks hoped would improve their ability to offer services through home computers and other devices. The venture, known as Integrion, is an attempt by both the banks and I.B.M. to wrest control over electronic banking from software companies like the Microsoft Corporation and Intuit Inc. It was introduced with an elaborate news conference in New York with promises about its vast potential.
9/1/1996	The Liberation of Dilbert	Geoffrey James article says the popularity of the comic strip Dilbert attests to the oppressiveness of the American workplace; says electronic-elite companies like Microsoft, Compaq, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are showing the way to a more humane and satisfying way of working by honoring and encouraging employee individuality and diversity (M)
8/27/1996	Through the Internet With a Pair of Rival Guides: Why Not Hire Both?	PARTLY because Microsoft and Netscape executives are openly antagonistic toward each other, it is tempting to characterize this month's rival introductions of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0 as a showdown, a David and Goliath struggle or even a deathmatch for ultimate domination of cyberspace. Hey, it's only software.
8/26/1996	Anxiety In the Land Of Gargoyles And Giants	The recent alliance between NBC and Microsoft may have got off to a shaky start, but that has not muted the anxiety much. Right now, the partners' all-news cable station (MSNBC) and Internet news service may seem like minor players in the media game, but there are fears on the part of critics that this is yet another turn of the screw, as technology companies, conglomerates and the entertainment industry spoon-feed the public ever more plentiful ''products'' and prepackaged information. Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting are probably going to succeed in their creation of a broadcasting behemoth. Last year, the Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion. A few years earlier, the General Electric Company bought RCA and NBC, Bertelsmann took over Doubleday, Sony absorbed CBS Records and Columbia Pictures, Viacom swallowed Paramount Communications, which had purchased Simon & Schuster, and Rupert Murdoch purchased 20th Century Fox, Harper & Row and Triangle Publications -- a frenzy of multimedia mergers.
8/26/1996	A Netscape Bid For the Souls of New Machines	Opening a new front in its increasingly bitter war with Microsoft, the Netscape Communications Corporation plans on Monday to announce that it has created a software company that will enter an alliance with I.B.M., Oracle and four Japanese consumer electronics giants, Netscape executives said in interviews over the weekend. The Netscape-led venture, called the Navio Corporation, intends to develop refined software for browsing the Internet and a new software operating system that the executives hope will become a standard means for controlling Internet access and basic operations for a broad range of consumer devices.
8/23/1996	Flaw Said to Be Found in Microsoft's Browser	A group of Princeton University computer researchers said yesterday that they had found a potentially serious computer flaw in Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3.0 Web Browser. The software, which has been available on the Internet from Microsoft's World Wide Web site since Aug. 13, has already been downloaded by 1.3 million computer users worldwide. Microsoft said yesterday that it was correcting the problem.
8/22/1996	$100 Million Fund Will Finance Java-Based Ventures	A leading venture capital firm has formed a $100 million fund to invest in companies that will create software and related products based on the Java programming language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Menlo Park, Calif., firm that was the primary backer of the Netscape Communications Corporation, as well as an early investor in Sun, has attracted a parade of high-technology giants to the fund. Along with Sun Microsystems, other investors are Cisco Systems, Comcast, Compaq Computer, I.B.M., Itochu, Netscape, Oracle, Tele-Communications Inc.,Technology Ventures and the U S West Media Group.
8/19/1996	Netscape Moves To Raise Stakes In Browser War	The Netscape Communications Corporation, striking back against last week's aggressive challenge from its archrival Microsoft, is expected to release a new version today of its Navigator Internet software that will include free ''home delivery'' of a broad array of news and sports information to an audience that could include millions of computer users. In a flurry of dealmaking intended to embrace and extend a similar strategy disclosed last week by Microsoft, Netscape quickly negotiated deals with 26 electronic publishers, including The New York Times on the Web, Sports Line USA, Sony Music and the Hot Wired Network. Users of the newest version of Netscape's web-browsing software will get preferential treatment from those information services, company officials said.
8/19/1996	I Navigate, You Explore, They Make Money	Software for the Internet, and the private-network versions of the Internet known as ''Intranets,'' can be divided into two broad categories: ''client'' software for desktop computers, and ''server'' software for network-controller computers. In the case of Netscape's Navigator software and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, both companies are blanketing the Internet with free or low-priced client versions in order to build a market for their more lucrative server products, which can sell for several hundred dollars or more.
8/16/1996	In Playground of Rich, Clock Is Ticking for a Camp That Withstood Time	For as long as people can remember, there have always been songs on summer nights filtering through the trees from the camp at continent's end. Today, the children, from Japan to New York, gathered as always to get a four-week imprint of the Pacific Northwest on their souls, are singing a Camp Nor'wester classic. Let it rain, Let it pour, Let it rain a whole lot more Cause I got the deep river blues. The blues are for real this time. One of the oldest summer camps in the West has been given one month to close out everything, to pack up the tepees, the canoes, the horses, the old piano, the books and backpacks, all the rag-tag bits of memory and leave Sperry Peninsula forever.
8/13/1996	Microsoft Acts To Enhance Web Package	Raising the competitive stakes to a rich new level in its World Wide Web browser war with the Netscape Communications Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation announced deals today providing for two of the Internet's most popular financial news and sports services to be bundled free into a new version of Microsoft's browsing software. Even though Netscape's Web browser, Netscape Navigator, is used by more than 85 percent of computer users for viewing information on the World Wide Web, Microsoft is aiming to make its Internet Explorer software the market leader.
8/7/1996	Netscape Notifies Justice Dept. of Its Microsoft Complaint	Netscape Communications' bitter software marketing war with Microsoft escalated into a threat of legal action today, as Netscape brought the dispute to the attention of the Justice Department's antitrust division. In a letter to Microsoft, which was copied to the Justice Department, a lawyer for Netscape accused Microsoft of antitrust violations for placing limits on the number of Internet connections that can be made to a single copy of Microsoft NT Workstation software.
8/1/1996	Microsoft Voices Confidence It Can Grow in Face of Changes	Executives of the Microsoft Corporation met today with Wall Street analysts, seeking to convince them that the company would not only be able to grapple with the changes brought on by the Internet but also stay on the remarkable growth path that led to a 46 percent increase in revenue and a 48 percent increase in earnings in its 1996 fiscal year ended in June. As it shifts its focus to the Internet, Microsoft, the software-publishing giant based in nearby Redmond, Wash., is rapidly approaching a crucial juncture in its software.
7/30/1996	American Express and Microsoft to Create On-Line Travel Service	"The American Express Company and the Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that they would create an on-line service enabling business travelers to book air, hotel and rental car reservations with their personal computers. """"Giving PC users real-time access to constantly changing information, in a marketplace like travel, delivers on the promise of the Internet,"""" said William H. Gates, chief executive of Microsoft. While that promise is still in its early stages, a number of competitors are also expected to offer on-line booking sometime soon."
7/30/1996	A New World Brought to You by . . .	TAKE cover! The paradigms are shifting again. Last year it was the $500 Internet computer, which was supposed to transmogrify the computing universe. Heralded as a bolt of inspiration from the computer gods on Mount Silicon, the $500 networked PC is likely to arrive not because of some profound paradigm shift, but rather simply because computers are getting cheaper all the time.
7/29/1996	Microsoft's Latest Web Venture: Making Critical Mass to Pay	The Microsoft Corporation's plan to fold World Wide Web capabilities into the company's Windows 95 PC operating system software is in many ways similar to technology under development by other companies, including Apple Computer Inc. and the Netscape Communications Corporation. But the reason that many industry experts see Microsoft's move as a fundamental shift in personal computing -- whether or not they consider it the most elegant approach technologically -- is one undeniable fact: Because it is the company whose software controls the basic operations of 80 percent of the world's personal computers, when Microsoft strikes out for a new horizon, the industry marches along.
7/28/1996	Connected, Yes, but Is It a Clear Connection?	"Since it started up two weeks ago, MSNBC, the 24-hour cable-news channel owned by NBC and Microsoft, has been trotting out its stars in an endless series of promos. Katie Couric, one of the hosts of """"Internight,"""" an interview show equipped to take E-mail and telephone questions from viewers, gushes, """"In a show like this, everybody's the host."""" (Has anyone told Larry King about this crazy concept?) Brian Williams, who is the anchor of a news program at 9 every night, says, """"With our prime-time news hour on MSNBC, you can see all the day's stories on your schedule."""" That is, if your schedule means you want to watch at 9. And in one arty-looking black-and-white spot, Tom Brokaw and Bryant Gumbel emerge out of deep shadows and say soberly, """"It's time to get connected."""" Though the atmosphere is meant to be futuristic, it seems ominous enough to make viewers cower and say: """"O.K., I'll get connected! Just don't hurt me."
7/26/1996	AT&T and Microsoft in Software Distribution Pact	AT&T and Microsoft said yesterday that they had formed an alliance in which each would distribute the other's on-line software. The alliance is similar to ones Microsoft forged earlier this year with America Online and Compuserve. AT&T Worldnet, which provides Internet access to an estimated 300,000 customers, will thus join three much larger services, America Online, Compuserve and Microsoft's own Microsoft Network. Each of these have access buttons built into Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system software, enabling a user to sign onto any of the services with a click of a mouse.
7/25/1996	CALDERA SUES MICROSOFT FOR ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS	Caldera Inc. said yesterday that it had filed a lawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation for antitrust violations. Caldera said it was seeking unspecified damages and an injunction stopping what it contends is Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct. The lawsuit echoes complaints filed years ago by the Department of Justice, which charged Microsoft with preventing other companies from selling operating system software to personal computer makers. Microsoft and the Justice Department reached a settlement two years ago.
7/24/1996	Journal;Cybernews Is No News	When the news first broke about T.W.A. flight 800, I did what any self-respecting American would do: glued myself to the TV. As a cable subscriber, I now had the added inducement of two all-disaster-all-the-time channels to surf between -- CNN and the spanking new MSNBC. Your cable box may not offer MSNBC yet, but surely you've seen the oppressively chic, laptop-laden promos. It's the future, it's the revolution, it's the Internet! Though MSNBC is the merger of network TV news and Microsoft, it was NBC's Brian Williams, not a Micronerd, who loomed on screen to fill air time with scanty information, dropped cues and droning experts. CNN's coverage followed the same old-fashioned TV tradition, except that its stiffly coiffed anchors seemed less human than the affable Mr. Williams. When the story is inexplicable mass death, a TV viewer wants company, not androids. On that irrational basis alone, I inclined toward MSNBC.
7/23/1996	Microsoft Has 52% Net Rise; Sees Expansion In Core Areas	The Microsoft Corporation reported a 52 percent earnings increase for its fiscal fourth quarter today, slightly exceeding Wall Street's expectations. More noteworthy, perhaps, was the company's report that its assault on the corporate computing market is picking up speed, led by Windows NT, its network operating system software. The company reported that licenses for the program increased 150 percent from the quarter last year.
7/23/1996	New and Familiar Faces In News Channel Debut	"Surfing through the debut week of MSNBC, the new cable news channel (""""The Revolution Begins Here""""), I noticed no revolution, but found a potential rival to CNN, with special attention to the Internet generation. This 24-hour-a-day collaboration between NBC News and Microsoft invites E-mail questions to add to the call-in questions, the interviewers' questions and the panelists' comments that keep talk television babbling along. Thousands of Web residents are hastening to put in their two bytes' worth, but CNN has its own Internet address (as well as a much bigger audience), and old-fashioned computer-challenged viewers couldn't care less one way or the other. Switching on during the day, viewers may not immediately recognize whether they are patronizing CNN or MSNBC, the headlines, the chat and even some of the commercials being pretty much the same. The new service benefits from fresh faces at the anchor desks along with """"the people you know,"""" NBC News familiars like Gwen Ifill. The production is a dash more elaborate than CNN's; the reporting can be overemphatic; the panelists seem smarter, but that could change as they sink into their roles."
7/22/1996	Microsoft Sees A Major Shift For Computers	The Microsoft Corporation, seeking to translate its dominance of personal computing into an upper hand on the Internet, is preparing to release new software that would bring the most fundamental change to personal computers since the machines were invented in the 1970's. The software, which the company demonstrated privately late last week and plans to begin distributing free to the public later this summer, is designed to blend the multimedia technology of the Internet's World Wide Web with the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system that comes as standard equipment on most new personal computers.
7/22/1996	A Hardware Team Offers A Mouse That Can Zoom	"When Microsoft reports its earnings this afternoon, it is a safe bet that no one on Wall Street will be focusing on how well Rick Thompson's business did. The 36-year-old Mr. Thompson runs a fast-growing operation within the Microsoft Corporation that gets little attention, no analysts' questions, no magazine stories and no business school case studies. Mr. Thompson and his team -- a hardware business within a software powerhouse -- are the poor relations of the Microsoft product family. """"We're the other guys at Microsoft,"""" he observed."
7/16/1996	ORACLE TO DISCUSS DETAILS ON INTRANETS	The Oracle Corporation plans to provide details today about its strategy for software that would allow corporations to build intranets, following both the Microsoft Corporation and the Netscape Communications Corporation. Based on Internet technology, intranets permit corporations to distribute information more efficiently to employees and to build corporatewide messaging and conferencing systems. Oracle executives said the company, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., had an advantage in such areas as the distribution of video and text retrieval as well as database retrieval and transaction processing. Computer-industry analysts believe that the market for corporate intranets will be at least as lucrative as the current Internet market.
7/16/1996	Tomorrow, the World Wide Web!;Microsoft, the PC King, Wants to Reign Over the Internet	As a captain of industry and the richest man in America, William H. Gates has often been compared to industrial titans of the past. And just as the railroad tycoons of the 1800's set the gauge for the nation's railroad tracks, Mr. Gates's Microsoft Corporation seems intent, its critics say, on the modern-day equivalent: controlling many of the basic technical specifications of the global Internet.
7/16/1996	Microsoft and NBC's TV-Internet Service Trips in Debut	Even as executives from NBC News and Microsoft were holding an elaborate news conference yesterday to kick off their MSNBC cable-television and Internet service, which they said heralded a new world of news delivery, MSNBC fell victim to some old-world glitches. Computer users were not able to sign on to the Internet component of the service for at least an hour after the network was switched on yesterday at 9 A.M. As a result, MSNBC's anchors on the cable channel found themselves promoting on-line features that no one could see.
7/8/1996	Journalist as Broker in Mixed Marriage Next Week of Microsoft and NBC News	Today, Merrill Brown may be stepping around paint cans and sawhorses in the MSNBC studios still under construction in Fort Lee, N.J., dressed in the white shirt, rep tie and conservative suit of a network television executive. Tomorrow he may be strolling the leafy campus of Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., in a T-shirt and jeans.
7/4/1996	MICROSOFT TO CONTINUE BUYING BACK ITS SHARES	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it planned to continue its stock repurchase program in the 1997 fiscal year. Microsoft repurchased about 13.5 million shares for $1.38 billion in the fiscal year that ended last Sunday. Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., said the number of shares to be acquired in the fiscal year 1997 hinged on the level of employee stock option exercises, the price of shares of Microsoft and market conditions. Microsoft's stock was down 50 cents yesterday, to $121.125 a share on the Nasdaq stock market.
7/2/1996	Microsoft Names Cohn & Wells	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it has selected Cohn & Wells in San Francisco to handle its business-to-business direct marketing account, which had been handled on a project basis by Anderson & Lembke in San Francisco, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $10 million. Greg Perlot, director for advertising and corporate research at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., said the decision came after a two-month review. Anderson & Lembke continues to handle product and interactive advertising for Microsoft.
7/1/1996	Three Minicomputer Pioneers Who Are Now Aging Quite Nicely	"They are among the elders of the computer industry now, three men who, in fierce competition with each other, made the machines that ushered in the era of minicomputers -- a quaint name for hardware that when compared with today's chihuahua-sized laptops is about as """"mini"""" as a St. Bernard. The men who, more than anyone, created the minicomputer industry more than two decades ago were C. Gordon Bell, 62, who spent 23 years at Digital Equipment; Tom West, 56, who, after 24 years, is still with Data General, and Horace Tsiang, 54, who left Wang Laboratories in 1990 after 21 years."
6/27/1996	Nintendo-Microsoft Deal on Data Delivery	In the first partnership between the king of video games and the colossus of software, the Nintendo Company and the Microsoft Corporation said today that they would deliver information and entertainment, mainly from the Internet, to personal computers via satellite broadcasting. Although this particular venture will offer its service only in Japan, Microsoft said the same technology might have applications elsewhere as a way of allowing people to obtain data from the Internet without the long delays and high charges now often incurred in exploring the net using telephone lines.
6/26/1996	Print Edition For Journal On Internet	Slate, the Microsoft Corporation's new political and cultural magazine published on the Internet's World Wide Web, has been widely anticipated as an attempt to define a new medium. But even as Microsoft was scrambling yesterday to meet technical problems and unexpectedly heavy demand for its new electronic journal, the company also described plans to publish it on paper as a conventional magazine.
6/25/1996	Microsoft Hires 2 Apple Software Writers	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had hired two key software designers from Apple Computer Inc. to work on its chief software products, adding to its roster of star computer scientists. Steve Capps, one of the original software designers of the Macintosh personal computer, and Walter Smith, who designed the software for Apple's Newton hand-held computer, plan to work in Microsoft's Internet platform and tools division.
6/24/1996	When On-Line Service Cannot Be Counted On	Blame sunspots or planetary alignment, computer gremlins or human error. More than a million computer network users suffered interrupted or erratic Internet and on-line service connections last week because of a variety of planned and unplanned service shutdowns. Because of a single bad line in a computer program, Netcom On-Line Communications Inc. had to shut down its entire national system for 12 hours on Wednesday, affecting more than 400,000 Internet users, most of them businesses.
6/19/1996	I.B.M. Prepares New Software In Push for Intranet Market	Responding to stepped-up competition from Microsoft and Netscape, I.B.M. plans to announce today its strategy for building internal corporate computer networks using new software from its Lotus subsidiary. The announcement is an attempt by the International Business Machines Corporation to stake a claim to the fast-growing market for so-called intranets, which are networks set up within businesses using the same technology that is the foundation of the global Internet.

But Netscape moved to pre-empt Microsoft today, saying that 92 of the nation's largest 100 companies were already using Netscape's products. Netscape, based in Mountain View, Calif., also detailed its own strategy, describing the next-generation versions of its Navigator program for browsing the Internet and its Suite Spot server software for the World Wide Web.

6/9/1996	Two Roads to China: Nice, and Not So Nice	AFTER this month, in an extraordinary example of corporate diplomacy, the Boeing Company will airlift its entire board to China. Ostensibly, the directors will simply be holding their regular bimonthly meeting there, while touring sites like the vast construction hangars in Xian where, with Boeing's help, tens of thousands of workers are trying to transform China into a world-class aerospace power. But the real purpose of the China tour is to deepen Boeing's ties to a small clutch of Chinese leaders who are by turns the aircraft maker's best customers and worst torturers. Just as oil companies have paved the way for Middle Eastern kings and emirs in America, Boeing is working harder than ever to impress the Chinese, intervening to defuse the cycle of recriminations between Beijing and Washington that has already begun to poison Boeing's hold on China's civilian aerospace market.
6/6/1996	NBC to Get Subsidy Package To Expand a Cable Network	NBC and Microsoft announced yesterday that their new 24-hour cable news network, MSNBC, will move down the road from Fort Lee, N.J., to expanded headquarters in Secaucus in November, taking advantage of a hefty package of financial incentives offered by the state. Under terms of legislation signed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman last month, as much as 80 percent of the personal income tax revenue generated by each new employee brought on New Jersey's tax rolls by the cable network will be returned to the companies, for up to 10 years.
6/5/1996	Microsoft Joins Compuserve in Internet Deal	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it planned to deploy an array of commercial Internet software services, code-named Normandy, that it will use to establish a beachhead in the Internet market, which is dominated by the Netscape Communications Corporation. Microsoft said Compuserve Inc., the on-line information service, would be the first major user of Normandy products.
6/3/1996	Bitterness and Posturing As Rivalries Resurface In Fight for CableNews	The all-news channel that NBC, in partnership with the Microsoft Corporation, plans to start next month has become entangled in a dispute between cable operators and the broadcast network. Several senior cable operators are threatening to balk at NBC's plans to distribute the new all-news channel in place of its current America's Talking channel. NBC is responding in kind, saying that any cable system that refuses to carry the news channel in place of America's Talking will face an immediate lawsuit, and, more ominously, will no longer get any programming from the top-rated broadcast network. That includes the 1996 Olympic Games from Atlanta, which begin only four days after the scheduled start of MSNBC.
5/30/1996	NBC Names Anchor For Cable Newscast	"NBC News announced yesterday that Brian Williams, the network's chief White House correspondent, would be the anchor and managing editor of its 9 P.M. hourlong newscast on MSNBC, the cable news network that NBC News and the Microsoft Corporation are starting on July 15. Mr. Williams, who is considered the eventual successor to Tom Brokaw as anchor of the """"NBC Nightly News,"""" also substitutes for Mr. Brokaw and is NBC's weekend anchor. He will continue to cover President Clinton and his re-election campaign until the election in November."
5/10/1996	Wife of Former Intuit Officer Among 6 Fined in Insider Case	The wife of William H. Lane, the former chief financial officer of Intuit Inc., agreed today to pay, along with five other people, more than $472,000 in fines for illegal insider trading connected to the company's proposed acquisition by the Microsoft Corporation. Mr. Lane's wife, Kathleen Lane, who is 53, agreed to pay a penalty of $202,803 for tipping the others about the proposed acquisition, which collapsed in May 1995. Her children, James Propp and Julie Propp, and their friends agreed to pay $269,500 in restitution and fines, court documents said.
5/7/1996	Tandem Computers to Create Machines With Microsoft	Tandem Computers Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation said today that they had set up an alliance to create machines that will be made by Tandem and will run the Microsoft Windows NT operating system. The first of the systems is to be available this summer. Though the companies will not formally announce the deal until Tuesday, the agreement was broadly anticipated. The shares of Tandem closed today at $14.125, up $1.125, while Microsoft shares closed at $111.75, up 87.5 cents, both in Nasdaq trading.
5/7/1996	Bell Labs Operating System To Be Offered for Networks	Lucent Technologies, which was formed by the recent split-up of AT&T, said today that it would soon begin marketing an operating system developed by Bell Labs for use on interactive networks. The operating system, named Inferno, is intended to operate either on a stand-alone basis in new computing and communications devices, or as an adjunct to existing operating systems like Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT or Unix.
5/6/1996	Microsoft's Dealers to Sell Over Internet	"The Microsoft Corporation plans to make its software products widely available for purchase over the Internet. """"We want to be where our customers want to shop,"""" said Johan Liedgren, director of reseller programs for Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash."
4/30/1996	Microsoft Offering News Without Charge on Internet	The Microsoft Corporation has made headlines countless times in the last 20 years, but now it wants to make headlines in a different way -- as a global news provider on the World Wide Web. The software giant is expected to announce today that MSN News, which has gathered and repackaged news articles for the million-member Microsoft Network on-line service since last August, has been shifted to the World Wide Web, where it is available without charge.
4/29/1996	In the Capital Of Cyberspace, But Far From Capital Politics	"He is a """"content provider"""" now, dressed in Microsoft Corporation camouflage of plaid shirt and hiking shoes. The Michael Kinsley who was the leftward half of """"Crossfire"""" on CNN and the mischievous editor of The New Republic seems to have been left to the archives of the East Coast. From the second floor of Building 25, a spotless, skylit affair not unlike Buildings 1 through 24 on the Microsoft campus here, Mr. Kinsley is preparing to start an on-line magazine of opinion, politics and the arts. It will be called Slate -- as in """"blank,"""" he is quick to point out. It is one of the most eagerly awaited projects to hop on the World Wide Web, at least in journalistic and political circles."
4/25/1996	An Edge for Sun As Microsoft Embraces Java	Sun Microsystems Inc., a stock market favorite lately on the strength of its Internet products, has secured a significant endorsement from the Microsoft Corporation and will announce next week that Microsoft is to incorporate Sun's Java software programming language into the Windows 95 personal computer operating system. The companies would not comment, but industry executives said Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is used on some 80 percent of the world's PC's, will join I.B.M. and Novell, among other companies, in announcing plans to embed Java into their software operating systems.
4/23/1996	New I.B.M. Software To Hear Commands	Hoping to increase sales of its troubled OS/2 operating system for personal computers, I.B.M. is including voice recognition capabilities in the next version of OS/2, known as Merlin, that will enable users to perform many routine tasks with simple oral commands. The new software, which will be demonstrated at I.B.M.'s annual developer conference today in Nashville, will allow users of OS/2 running on computers equipped with the Intel Corporation's Pentium microprocessor to open programs, or even go directly to sites on the World Wide Web, with a single voice command, said John Soyring, I.B.M.'s vice president of personal software products.
4/21/1996	Seahawk Agreement Made	"Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has purchased an exclusive option to buy the Seattle Seahawks from owner Ken Behring by July 1997, an Allen spokesman said today. """"This option is the first step toward ensuring the Seahawks remain in Seattle,"""" Allen said in a statement."
4/19/1996	Microsoft's Net Rises 42%, Belying Idea of a PC Slump	Belying reports of a slump in the personal computer industry, the Microsoft Corporation reported today a 42 percent rise in earnings for its fiscal third quarter, beating the consensus of analysts' earnings estimates by a few cents. Although Microsoft reported its earnings after the market's close, its shares soared $3.0625, closing at $109 in heavy Nasdaq trading in anticipation of a strong report. The gain returned Microsoft shares to a high not seen since July 17, but in after-hours trading, Microsoft shares fell as low as $107, apparently because of disappointment that the company's earnings had not met the most optimistic estimates.
4/16/1996	A Repair Kit for Windows Software	MICROSOFT WINDOWS users need all the help they can get, Mac mavens like to say. That may be a bit unfair, but it is not entirely untrue. But the Macintosh itself has become more complicated over the years, and it is a brave soul who does not have Norton Utilities or a similar fix-it program at hand. Still, those programs concentrate on hardware. Here we are talking about software, Windows software. Two weeks ago, I discussed Quarterdeck's Cleansweep 95, version 2.02, a program to help Windows fans clean programs and related detritus off their hard disks. A reader called to say that none of the three big software shops he tried had a version later than 2.0. A Quarterdeck spokesman countered that first, the salespeople were probably trying to get rid of an overstock of 2.0 before putting the newer version out; second, you cannot tell whether or not you had bought the newer version until you install it, because neither the packaging nor the manuals had been changed, and third, the patches that made Cleansweep 95, version 2.0, into versions 2.02 or 2.03 could be downloaded from Compuserve (go quarterdeck) or the World Wide Web (http://www.quarterdeck.com) anyway.
4/15/1996	New Leader at Helm of the Microsoft Network	Russell Siegelman, who guided the Microsoft Network, or MSN, on-line service from its inception to a subscriber base of more than a million users, said on Friday that he was stepping down to pursue other interests within the Microsoft Corporation. Mr. Siegelman will be succeeded by Laura Jennings, who was named vice president of the Microsoft Network on Friday. Ms. Jennings, who joined MSN as executive producer last fall, previously was in charge of developing software that enabled groups of workers to collaborate.
4/14/1996	1990's: Nov. 5, 1995;Making Microsoft Safe for Capitalism	"In a historical eye blink, as the technologies of computing have come to pervade the world's economic life, Microsoft has turned 20 years old. When Ronald Reagan became President, Bill Gates's new company was an unincorporated partnership with accounts kept in handwritten ledgers. Apple was a big new personal-computer company, worth $3 billion; I.B.M., the mainframe giant, was cobbling together its first personal computer out of parts from outside suppliers. By 1990, just a decade later, Microsoft had become the world's richest software company, though it had no leading product in any important category but operating systems. Today nearly half of the world's total PC software revenue now goes directly to Microsoft. """"I personally believe that Microsoft is the most powerful economic force in the United States in the second half of the 20th century,"""" says Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer of Sun Microsystems -- a minicomputer and networking company whose business used to be remote from Microsoft's but now finds itself under direct competitive pressure. Some of Microsoft's control over computing, at all levels, is obvious. Much, however, is invisible. Even longtime insiders are just beginning to understand the nature of that power: how Microsoft acquired it, preserves it and exercises it."
4/11/1996	BELL ATLANTIC TO OFFER INTERNET ACCESS	The Bell Atlantic Corporation jumped on the Internet bandwagon yesterday, saying it would offer access to the global computer network next month. The Baby Bell, which is based in Philadelphia, signed a licensing agreement with the Netscape Communications Corporation for Internet browsing software. It also said it planned to offer a version of the Microsoft Corporation's on-line service, Microsoft Network. Bell Atlantic joins the AT&T Corporation, the MCI Communications Corporation and the Nynex Corporation in establishing an Internet strategy. Bell Atlantic shares rose $1.25 each, to $61.25. Netscape gained $3.25, to $52.50.
4/9/1996	Microsoft Places Account in Review	The Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash., said yesterday that it had placed in review its business-to-business direct marketing account, with billings estimated at $10 million. The account had been handled until February by the Anderson & Lembke unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in San Francisco, which resigned that portion of the account while continuing to handle the advertising and on-line media portions. Microsoft has hired Pickholz Tweedy Cowan in New York, an affiliate of the Cassidy Companies, to help manage the review; a decision is expected by July 1.
4/9/1996	Your New 1997 PC, or Maybe Not	WHAT is wrong with your home computer? Plenty, hints the Microsoft Corporation. It takes too long to start up when you press the on button. It makes connecting peripherals too hard. It insists you pry open the case and confront scary electronic innards if you want to add something as crucial as memory. It needs a bigger screen and better audio and video so that the whole family can gather round the joystick and kill realistic menacing on-screen creatures in an atmosphere of togetherness. Maybe the computer should even be linked to the VCR and stereo system so that you can record your digital triumphs for posterity. And if it is going to live in the home entertainment center, the computer should be cool and sleek instead of a utilitarian fugitive from a desktop.
4/9/1996	Microsoft in an Agreement To Acquire Aha! Software	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had agreed to acquire the Aha! Software Corporation, a private company that makes pen-based programs for portable computers. Terms were not disclosed. Aha!, based in Mountain View, Calif., is best known for the Inkwriter program. Unlike most pen-based software, Inkwriter does not try to recognize handwriting and convert it into type; instead, it allows users to write and send notes in their own handwriting. But Inkwriter gives users the ability to edit their handwriting, by highlighting words or phrases, and by cutting and pasting material, as if it were in typeface. Although the acquisition cost of Aha! would be negligible for Microsoft, analysts said the deal underscored the software giant's commitment to pen computing, a market segment thought moribund by many. Sales of Inkwriter have been limited, at least in part because it first appeared on Sony's Magic Link and Motorola's Envoy personal digital assistants, which have not been big sellers. But the technology is well regarded and can run on Microsoft's operating systems as well.
4/9/1996	Bridging the Mac-Windows Gap	THE human race has functioned fairly well for thousands of years despite a large number of operating system incompatibilities. There are different standards for sex, language, race, religion, politics and personal computers. With its new program Soft Windows 95 for Power Macintosh, Insignia Solutions Inc. has done little to resolve the battle of the sexes or the 1996 election, but it has succeeded fairly well in forging a closer relationship between the Macintosh and Windows cultures. Soft Windows 95, with an estimated retail price of $350, effectively converts a fast Macintosh into a slow 486-based PC that is capable of using Windows software.
4/2/1996	Gates Acquires Rights To Adams Photo Images	William H. Gates, the computer software billionaire, has added to his storehouse of images by acquiring the electronic rights to the works of Ansel Adams, the nature photographer and environmentalist. The licensing deal, which will be announced today, gives Mr. Gates the electronic rights to images of stark mountainous vistas that are icons of the American wilderness. Roughly nine million books, posters and calendars based on Adams photographs have been sold.
4/1/1996	New Software For Business By Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation is expected to announce on Tuesday that it has begun shipping its Exchange program, a tool for managing corporate mail that also allows groups of workers to share documents and projects.

The program, is a direct challenge to the popular Notes software of Lotus Development, now owned by I.B.M.
3/29/1996	From Microsoft, Plans for a New Machine	The Microsoft Corporation, trying to maintain its dominance over computing standards, is about to mount a counterattack on the industry's quest for a $500 Internet computer. Contending that high performance, not low price, should be the priority, Microsoft on Monday will describe its vision: a device that might represent a grand fusion between the Internet and the electric appliances that now populate the American home, including the television, stereo, videocassette recorder and personal computer.
3/28/1996	Sony, Getting Into PC's, Is Planning a Software Operating System	In what would be an audacious move for a Japanese company, the Sony Corporation is planning to develop a new software operating system, officials said today. Such operating systems, the fundamental software controlling computers and some other electronic machines, have been dominated by American companies. The officials said Sony did not intend to compete directly with the Microsoft Corporation in personal computer operating systems, but was aiming at the expected market for products that combine computing with audio, video and networking capabilities.
3/27/1996	I.B.M. Set to Release Cheaper Software	In a bid to blunt the growing momentum of the Microsoft Corporation and improve its weak software business, the International Business Machines Corporation plans to introduce a series of aggressively priced new software packages today that run on corporate networks. The new software combines more than 50 products, which were previously sold separately, into seven integrated bundles centered around specific applications such as those for data bases, communications and systems management. And in a break with tradition, the applications will run on Microsoft's Windows NT operating system as well as OS/2 and AIX, two of I.B.M.'s operating systems.
3/26/1996	Microsoft Says It Has a Million on Line	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that its Microsoft Network on-line service had one million subscribers after seven months of operations. The on-line service -- which offers electronic mail, news and access to the Internet worldwide computer network -- reached the milestone about four months sooner than Microsoft executives expected, Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, said yesterday in an interview.
3/25/1996	Taking In the Sites;Of Virtual Oscars and Film Fantasy	"Alan Goodrich gagged when he heard the nominees for tonight's Oscar ceremony. So he did what any self-respecting 18-year-old would do these days: he posted The Academy Awards Protest Page on the World Wide Web. Mr. Goodrich, a freshman at the State University of New York at Binghamton, tells why each contender is unsuitable, then offers his own higher-brow picks. Within a day, he was being flamed by E-mail writers, accusing him of taking flicks too seriously. """"I tried to make it satire,"""" he said. """"I guess I didn't make it obvious enough."
3/21/1996	Digital Says It Won't Meet Forecasts, and a Sector Slumps	Blaming slow sales of its personal computers, the Digital Equipment Corporation said yesterday that this quarter's earnings would fall below analyst expectations. The news sent Digital's shares tumbling nearly 17 percent, dragging down other computer issues and, in turn, the broader market. The question for investors in Digital and other technology issues is whether the slowing sales of personal computers is a temporary or protracted trend.
3/14/1996	A New Compuserve Service Plans to Appeal to Families	Compuserve Inc. disclosed plans yesterday for a proprietary service aimed at families and novice computer users. In offering such a service, Compuserve is going against the tide of the consumer on-line industry, which has moved toward an open approach within the Internet.
3/14/1996	Microsoft Wins Piracy Lawsuit	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had been awarded $8.08 million in damages in a software piracy lawsuit it filed against Unitron Inc., a computer manufacturer in Taiwan. The software giant, based in Redmond, Wash., said it had won the judgment in Federal District Court in Los Angeles against Unitron, a former licensee of Microsoft operating system software.
3/13/1996	Plan to Block Censorship On Internet	The top on-line services companies and the National Consumers League announced yesterday that they would begin a campaign to educate the public about intellectual property rights, privacy and consumer protection on the Internet. The initiative is part of the on-line industry's response to the new Communications Decency Act, which makes it a felony to knowingly transmit indecent or patently offensive material over computer networks where children may see it.
3/13/1996	Microsoft Gives Demonstrations of Its New Technologies	The Microsoft Corporation gave a series of technology demonstrations today that disclosed new details of how the company intends to leverage its dominance of personal computing software into a dominant role in the Internet market. The new technologies, to become available later this year in Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system, would be a key component of the alliance that the company announced with America Online. Under that deal, America Online will distribute Microsoft's Internet software in return for Microsoft's including access to America Online's information service as a standard option in Windows 95.
3/13/1996	America Online Gives Microsoft Favored Status On Internet	What a difference a day makes in cyberspace. A day after it announced a licensing agreement to adopt Netscape Communications' popular Navigator software for browsing the Internet's World Wide Web, America Online said yesterday that it would make Microsoft's rival program, Internet Explorer, its primary software for browsing the Web.
3/12/1996	Microsoft and DirecTV Form an Alliance	The Microsoft Corporation and the satellite broadcast system DirecTV said yesterday that they would collaborate to deliver digital entertainment and information services to personal computers within the year. In addition to the 175 channels of entertainment, sports, music and information that DirecTV, a unit of General Motors' Hughes Electronics Corporation, now beams to 1.3 million homes equipped with 18-inch receiver dishes and television set-top boxes, The two companies said they would work with others to develop new forms of interactive, digital services that can be displayed on a television or a computer screen.
3/12/1996	America Online in Alliances With AT&T and Netscape	America Online announced two major alliances yesterday, with AT&T and Netscape Communications, that were intended to help the world's largest on-line information service take fuller advantage of the Internet's growing popularity. America Online said it would offer the news services, discussion groups and informational material from its own on-line service to customers of AT&T's new Worldnet Internet access service at an unspecified discount. The move, which is similar to a cable television programmer like HBO signing a distribution deal with a cable operator, will enable America Online to expand its audience by taking advantage of AT&T's nationwide network reach and powerful marketing influence.
3/11/1996	Microsoft Issues Pink Slips To Most 3.5-Inch Floppies	You may want to stash a couple of floppy disks in your memorabilia collection, next to the vinyl LP's and eight-track tapes, to someday show your grandchildren the quaint storage devices once ubiquitous in computers. Demand for the 1.44-megabyte, 3.5-inch floppy is on the wane. Part of the proof is Microsoft's winding down of its Canyon Park floppy disk assembly plant in the Seattle suburb of Bothell, where 120 workers were recently let go.
3/8/1996	NETSCAPE STOCK PLUMMETS IN BATTLE WITH MICROSOFT	The stock of the Netscape Communications Corporation, which has lost more than half its value in the last five weeks over worries that the Microsoft Corporation will beat it out in the war over software for use on the Internet, fell almost 14 percent yesterday. The shares were down $6.25, to $38.75, in Nasdaq trading. They stood at $83.50 on Jan. 31. Microsoft and Netscape are taking shots at each other's software and courting business partners. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Microsoft was trying to license its Internet software to America Online Inc. in a move to derail talks between America Online and Netscape. America Online has more than five million customers; gaining access to them would be a coup for Netscape or Microsoft.
3/6/1996	A Founder Sells Microsoft Stock	A co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, Paul Allen, has sold 700,000 Microsoft shares worth about $70 million in the last two weeks. Susan Pierson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Allen, said on Monday that she had no comment on whether his reported interest in buying the Seattle Seahawks football team had anything to do with the sale. Mr. Allen sold the 700,000 shares Feb. 20 to 22, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Share prices ranged from $97.75 to $102.50.

The billings were estimated at $15 million to $25 million. John Zagula, group marketing manager for desktop applications at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek. Microsoft will compile a list of direct marketing agencies to participate in the review, he said, adding that Anderson & Lembke, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, would continue to handle an estimated $100 million in Microsoft product and business-to-business advertising as well as serving as agency of record in buying interactive media.

Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., said yesterday that the company's traditional strength as a global maker of sophisticated systems would make it a major power in the era of network computing, which is being fueled by the rapid growth of the Internet. Mr. Gerstner and two of his lieutenants gave an unusually lengthy three-hour exposition of I.B.M.'s strengths and weaknesses to a group of Wall Street analysts and major investors in New York. The overall message was that the company's leadership in network computing in the years ahead would more than make up for disastrous missteps in the last 15 years, during the era of personal computers. """"The industry is coming back our way,"""" Mr. Gerstner said. """"It's coming back to our sweet spot."
3/4/1996	Netscape Plans Additions to Software Line	The Netscape Communications Corporation plans to introduce updated and new software this week, its co-founder, Marc Andreessen, said. Netscape plans to cut prices on many of the server programs as part of its battle with the Microsoft Corporation, analysts said. Businesses use server software to build storefronts, for electronic commerce and mail, and to exchange information between offices.
3/1/1996	Microsoft Backs Ratings System For the Internet	The Microsoft Corporation, contending that individuals rather than governments should control what people see on the Internet, has endorsed a new voluntary ratings system for information distributed via the World Wide Web. The company also said it would build a complete information filtering system into the next version of its Internet Explorer software.

2/20/1996	Apple Computer Makes Motorola Licensing Deal	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would license its Macintosh operating system to Motorola Inc. and for the first time Apple said that it would allow Motorola to sell its own sublicenses to the popular software program. While the announcement was expected, industry analysts said the licensing arrangement points to a new Apple strategy of confronting the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation in parts of the world where the personal computer market is not yet well developed. However, the new agreement still fell short of providing Apple with a licensing partner among the top PC makers in the United States.
2/20/1996	Microsoft Sets A Revamping To Gain Edge On the Internet	The Microsoft Corporation plans to announce a company-wide reorganization today to strengthen its focus in both the interactive computing market and its traditional operating systems business. The moves are aimed, in part, at placing Microsoft in a position to dominate the next wave of the computer business that will be based on interactive technologies, now primarily on the Internet, just as it dominates personal computer software. Interactive technology is an expanding market in which Microsoft is perceived in the industry to be trailing the Netscape Communications Corporation.
2/15/1996	Visa and Microsoft to Plan Home Banking System	Visa International and the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that they had agreed to work together to offer a complete system for home banking and bill-paying services.

2/7/1996	MICROSOFT PURCHASE INVESTIGATED BY U.S.	The Microsoft Corporation's acquisition of a fledgling World Wide Web software company, Vermeer Technologies Inc., is being investigated by Federal antitrust regulators, the Justice Department said yesterday. The investigators are looking at whether the purchase will hurt competition on the Internet's World Wide Web. It is unusual because it involves such a small company in the emerging and competitive market for Web software, antitrust lawyers said. Since last year, Federal officials have been examining the company's entry into the market for on-line information services. The Justice Department investigation of the Vermeer acquisition was first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal.
2/6/1996	Microsoft to Give Away Web Server Software	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would begin distributing free software that businesses could use to create World Wide Web sites on computers using its Windows NT operating system. The move is seen as a direct salvo against Netscape Communications Inc., which sells similar software. The programs allow companies to create and maintain information sites either on the Internet or for internal company use.
2/5/1996	New Virus Designed to Tackle Windows 95	Software saboteurs have created the first computer virus specifically aimed at the Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 program, British researchers said today. The virus can corrupt programs so that they no longer function. It can be spread when an infected program is run another user's PC, said Paul Ducklin, an analyst for the British software company Sophos.
2/2/1996	Microsoft and BET Form Joint Venture	The Microsoft Corporation and Black Entertainment Television said today that they were beginning a joint venture that at first would provide entertainment and news for black Americans on the Internet. The Microsoft-Black Entertainment Television alliance is the latest in a series of ventures the software giant has announced with other broadcasters and media companies to distribute their products on the global computer network.
2/1/1996	Plan to Guard Credit Safety On Internet	Hoping to remove a major impediment to credit card transactions over the Internet, a business group led by Mastercard International and Visa International plans to announce an industry-standard technology on Thursday for protecting the security of electronic payments. The new technical standard brings together previously warring camps -- one led by the giant Microsoft Corporation, the other by an Internet software upstart, the Netscape Communications Corporation.
1/30/1996	Microsoft and MCI Agree On an Internet Alliance	In the promiscuous world of digital technology, where most companies prefer playing the field to going steady, MCI Communications said yesterday that it had signed an Internet alliance with the Microsoft Corporation. This, even though it already has an on-line partnership with the News Corporation. Under the terms of the deal, MCI and Microsoft will jointly develop and market an array of on-line and Internet services. Microsoft said it had chosen MCI as the primary distributor of its commercial on-line service, the Microsoft Network. And MCI said it would promote Microsoft's Internet software and browser throughout its network.
1/30/1996	A Clash of Titanic Web Browsers	FOR many people, Netscape is synonymous with the Internet. The Netscape Communications Corporation, whose corporate symbol is a fire-breathing monster nicknamed Mozilla, makes the Netscape Navigator software used by millions of people to operate and browse the Internet's popular World Wide Web. But fans of Japanese science fiction films will recall that Mozilla's role model, Godzilla, had some tough fights. Sure enough, a titanic struggle looms between Mozilla and its genetically altered twin: Microsoftra, better known as Microsoft Internet Explorer.
1/24/1996	CBS Executive Chosen to Head NBC's All-News Cable Channel	NBC yesterday appointed Mark Harrington, a longtime CBS executive, to be vice president and general manager of its new all-news cable network, currently called MSNBC. The channel, which could be operating as early as July and may be renamed, is a co-venture between NBC and the Microsoft Corporation. Mr. Harrington will report to Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, who is in charge of MSNBC.
1/23/1996	A Rally for America Online On Possible Netscape Deal	Shares of America Online Inc. surged 12 percent yesterday following reports that the company might form an alliance with Netscape, the leading maker of software for browsing the Internet's World Wide Web. Shares of the Netscape Communications Corporation rose 11 percent. Discussions between the companies are preliminary and may not result in an agreement, one person familiar with the talks said. Still, the negotiations are the latest sign of how quickly on-line companies are overhauling their own Internet strategies and scrambling to gain access to industry-standard software.
1/20/1996	COMPANY'S SHARES RISE ON EARNINGS REPORT	Shares of the Microsoft Corporation rose strongly yesterday after the software company reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on strong sales of its Windows 95 operating system. Shares of the world's biggest personal computer software company gained $4.25, to $91.875, in Nasdaq trading of 14.2 million shares. Microsoft said its second-quarter profit from operations rose a better-than-expected 45 percent. The company also reported strong sales of its general business programs, consumer software and networking software. At least three Wall Street analysts raised their rating on Microsoft's stock because of bullish projections about the company's earning growth for the rest of the fiscal year.
1/19/1996	Higher Results Are Reported By Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation reported today that its earnings rose 54 percent in its fiscal second quarter. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates and set the stage for a continued rally in the technology stocks. Microsoft reported its results after the close of the market. In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft shares had closed at $87.625, up $2.75, on a strong day for technology shares after the International Business Machines Corporation reported positive results.
1/18/1996	It's Been an Uphill Battle to Sell Windows 95	"As the editor of the newsletter Release 1.0, host of the industry conference PC Forum and chairwoman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public policy group, Esther Dyson is one of computing's elite. So shortly before Microsoft's Windows 95 went on sale last August, Ms. Dyson was an obvious choice to appear on the PBS talk show """"Charlie Rose,"""" offering her expert commentary on a new-product introduction that seemed part marketing extravaganza and part social phenomenon. Yet months later, Ms. Dyson has not yet bought the Windows 95 program. For now, she says, she is content to do her computing with the previous version of Windows, running on an older personal computer not stretched to its limits by Microsoft's powerful new program."
1/9/1996	An Integrated Program Just for Windows 95	FOR the most part, Windows 95 seems to run Windows 3.1 applications just fine. But the real test of an operating system is how well it runs applications written especially for it. Microsoft Works 4.0 for Windows 95 is an integrated program. Let me confess that I have a weakness for integrated programs, ones that house several applications under one roof. Their individual modules are not as powerful as leading stand-alone programs, but they are often brawnier than most of us need. The complexities of Microsoft Word are a bit much for writing ordinary business letters or notes to the teacher, and Excel is overkill for a simple expense account.
1/8/1996	Microsoft Takes a Stab at Making PC's Consumer Friendly	"By now, the millions of people who have purchased Windows 95 have found that Microsoft's new operating system may be an improvement, but personal computers can still be maddeningly difficult machines to use. Often, to get games or communications programs to run, the user still has to fiddle with software files residing in the PC's innards and be fluent in the arcane nomenclature of """"win.ini"""" and """"config.sys."""" Besides, any machine that a person has to """"boot up"""" instead of """"turn on"""" can scarcely lay claim to being a consumer device."
12/31/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	"A footnote in """"Making Microsoft Safe for Capitalism"""" (Nov. 5) discloses that the author, James Gleick, founded the Pipeline, an Internet service and software company. The article fails to disclose, however, that Gleick is today a major stockholder in a Microsoft competitor. Gleick sold his interest in the Pipeline to Performance Systems International (P.S.I.). According to P.S.I.'s most recent financial proxy statement, Gleick owns 5.5 percent of the company, which is an ownership stake of more than $32 million. P.S.I. is in direct competition with Uunet, an Internet-access provider in which Microsoft is a substantial investor. Uunet provides the Microsoft Network (MSN), our on-line service, with full Internet access. Recently, The Washington Post described P.S.I. and Uunet as """"two of the nation's hottest access providers to the Internet."
12/18/1995	From Mainframes to Global Networking;I.B.M. Gazes Into Its Crystal Ball and, Hey, Where Did the Hardware Go?	Two decades ago, I.B.M. stumbled into the world of computer networking when several of its large customers began asking for an easy way to exchange data between their mainframes. In response to its clients, and as a way to keep in touch with its own international sales and service offices, I.B.M. later began setting up a series of data networks around the world. But the company's focus remained what had made it the giant of its industry: selling hardware and software. That was where most of its annual revenue was derived; electronic mail and other network services came as an afterthought.
12/17/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	If the letters published in your Nov. 26 issue, in response to Gleick's article, are a reasonably accurate reflection of those received, then Times readers are far more worshipful of the almighty dollar, and those who make it, than I would have guessed. These letters are the sort that I would expect to find in The Wall Street Journal. Bill Gates may have many talents, but it appears that his main talents are bullying his competitors and bamboozling the public. SHERMAN L. GREENE New York
12/17/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	"Finally! An excellent and well-argued article in a publication outside the trade press that sheds light on the subtle and complex nature of the Microsoft monopoly (""""Making Microsoft Safe for Capitalism,"""" by James Gleick, Nov. 5). Even though many industry analysts argue that it is too late to address the monopolistic position Microsoft has at the """"application program interface,"""" or A.P.I., level, it is a key aspect of the problem and Gleick presents it well. A.P.I.'s are indeed an essential facility, like radio broadcasting standards were in an earlier era."
12/15/1995	G.E. Chief's View: 'Who Better to Hang Around With?'	Just as success has a hundred fathers, successful young businessmen seem to have no shortage of adoptive fathers. William H. Gates, the 40-year-old chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, is already fast friends with Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor. And yesterday, Mr. Gates won the affection of yet another elder: John F. Welch Jr., the 60-year-old chairman of General Electric.
12/15/1995	Microsoft and NBC News Hold a Little Satellite Chat	"The imagery that accompanied yesterday's announcement of the joint venture between NBC and the Microsoft Corporation to create a new all-news cable channel was indeed dazzling. In a scene reminiscent of """"Casablanca,"""" the NBC News anchor, Tom Brokaw, appeared on a movie-sized video screen live from an airfield in Ramstein, Germany, a fleet of C-130 transport planes arrayed behind him as snow gently fell. Across the room, on another enormous screen, the scene was high-tech contemporary, as William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, appeared live by satellite from Hong Kong."
12/12/1995	NBC-Microsoft Talks Denied	The Microsoft Corporation and the General Electric Company's NBC unit denied a report yesterday that they were in talks about the sale of a stake in the television network to Microsoft.
12/11/1995	Java-Crazy	Internet fever hit a plateau of sorts on Thursday when Microsoft announced its long-awaited Internet strategy, including the decision to license Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. (What is really amazing, though, is that people even care. Since when did anyone but eggheads and computer nerds notice computer languages? Since Microsoft took over from I.B.M. the role of bluest of blue-chip companies.) Investors and computer users have become used to the idea that Microsoft sets all the technical standards in desktop computing. Thus the decision to license Java has been heralded as a change of strategy for Microsoft, as a concession of its failure to control the growing Internet market with its own technology. But  it isn't really a new strategy at all. It is a sign that on the Internet, as with personal computers, Microsoft will not be denied.
12/11/1995	Microsoft and G.E. Are Seen in Discussions	Top executives of the Microsoft Corporation and the General Electric Company have reportedly been meeting to discuss ways in which the two companies might distribute news or other material together. One executive close to the discussions, who insisted on anonymity, said last night that the companies might announce a partnership this week involving an all-news cable television channel.
12/11/1995	Microsoft Quietly Puts Together Computer Research Laboratory	"Bill Gates may have been out on a book tour lately hawking his vision of everyone else's information-highway future in """"The Road Ahead."""" But back at headquarters he has quietly assembled some of the industry's best and brightest computer researchers to help choose the paths that Microsoft itself should follow. They are seasoned travelers all, including Butler Lampson, the computer scientist who helped design the first personal computer, the Xerox Alto, in 1973 and the first office computer network technology, Ethernet, in 1976; C. Gordon Bell, the former Digital Equipment Corporation researcher who in the late 1970's led the development of what would become the world's most successful minicomputer, and Jim Gray, a pioneer developer of modern computer data bases."
12/8/1995	Paved With Good Intentions	Reader's note: As with all Chaff's Notes(TM) QuikStudy(TM) publications, this synopsis is not a substitute for the actual book. It is only an instructive and  interpretive supplement to the text, a time-saving critical tool that just happens to cost some $29 less than the text itself.
12/8/1995	Microsoft Seeks Internet Market; Netscape Slides	Seeking to convince Wall Street and millions of PC users that the world's largest software company can dominate the global computer Web just as it currently dominates desktop computing, the Microsoft Corporation's chairman, William H. Gates 3d, said today that every effort at the company would now be directed toward the Internet. Mr. Gates described a broad battle plan for integrating Internet components and communications links into every Microsoft product, including its popular Windows operating system, its suite of office productivity software and the more advanced tools used by businesses to link workers on public and private computer networks.
12/7/1995	I.B.M. Plans to Add Java Software Language to Its Arsenal	For much of the last decade, I.B.M. has been criticized for missing opportunities by stubbornly sticking to its own home-grown software rather than embracing de facto industry standards like the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system. Yesterday, the tables appeared to have turned. The International Business Machines Corporation announced that it was licensing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s new Java software language, which is rapidly emerging as a new standard for developing interactive software for the Internet.
12/5/1995	2 On-Line Banking Champions at Crossroad	After more than a decade of false starts and stumbles, it appears that electronic banking may finally gain wide acceptance in 1996. But two of the champions of on-line banking, once allies, are trying to persuade bankers to follow different paths. Intuit Inc. said yesterday that it planned to expand its home banking services to the global Internet by the middle of next year, adding a new avenue for participating banks and financial institutions to reach potentially millions of new consumers and small businesses.
12/4/1995	Java Backers Taking Aim At Microsoft's Dominance	Hoping to steal a march on the Microsoft's Corporation's Internet strategy, which will be disclosed this week, a number of Silicon Valley companies plan announcements on Monday that together constitute an anti-Microsoft campaign. The most noteworthy: A plan by Sun Microsystems Inc. and the Netscape Communications Corporation for a user-friendly version of the Java software technology for the Internet's World Wide Web. Moreover, Microsoft is apparently in some internal turmoil over what strategy it should take with respect to the Java language.
12/2/1995	Journal;Gates Goes Public	"If you're Bill Gates, the wealthiest man in America, you don't have to settle for merely one publicity blitz a year like every other mogul -- you can help yourself to two. Though it seems like only yesterday that the logo for Windows 95, the latest software product from Microsoft, was as ubiquitous as O. J., now Mr. Gates's face itself is everywhere -- in an Annie Leibovitz photograph on his new book, """"The Road Ahead,"""" which is elbowing Colin Powell and Howard Stern out of prime superstore display space, and on """"Nightline,"""" """"Today"""" and the David Letterman show, where Mr. Gates, wearing a lab jacket, served as stooge in a sketch about a Rube Goldbergesque """"quiz machine."
11/28/1995	Bookshelf For Win95 Filling Up	IF Windows 95 is so easy to operate, why has every PC magazine for months offered long articles on mastering it? Why are books flooding in? In a sense it is easy to use, at least on the surface, and perhaps easier if you are not moving to it from Windows 3.1. But there are hidden depths to be explored.
11/26/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	As a relatively new consumer of PC software, I'm certainly not mad at Bill Gates -- jealous maybe, but not mad. Gleick's critique is tiresomely familiar. Since the accomplishments of the outstandingly successful must have been wrought underhandedly, let's hobble those bad guys: tax them, regulate them, penalize them, subsidize their competitors. Level the playing field! We set the example by trying to drag down the Bill Gateses and Ross Perots because they are too successful; by allowing our kids to coast through school with a fraction of the effort required in other advanced societies. And then we wonder why some other country is beating our brains out in the very fields in which the United States made the initial breakthrough. Go figure.
11/26/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	"When and if Microsoft flounders in aptly exploiting its """"monopoly"""" status, competitors will rush in to swipe the business. Microsoft is neither omnipotent nor omniscient. Just very, very smart, agile and determined, as your own article documents. I would be very happy if Microsoft, and Microsoft alone, made it possible for me to fax, phone, E-mail, catch a movie, order a pizza, publish a newsletter and lose weight -- all with the same $10 swatch of software on some two-pound I.B.M. compatible. Gleick should be exuberant over what Microsoft has achieved instead of cynically censuring it."
11/26/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	In checking the credits for the 800-pound Microsoft gorilla on your cover, I see there is a stylist. My compliments. It's a helluva coif. DICK SEARS Jupiter, Fla.
11/26/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	"James Gleick's """"Making Microsoft Safe for Capitalism"""" (Nov. 5) makes it sound as if Microsoft were doing something wrong by being a strong competitor and by creating innovative software that customers decide to buy. The PC software business is incredibly competitive. Prices decline even as products improve dramatically. The Internet is creating even more opportunities for competition. Microsoft must continue to innovate or we will be history. This is not paranoia; it is simple fact."
11/23/1995	Windows 95 Comes to Japan	Two of Germany's largest media groups and the country's biggest telecommunications company said today that they would join forces with America Online Inc. to offer Europe-wide interactive communications networks. The agreement in principle signed by the publishers Bertelsmann A.G. and Axel Springer Verlag A.G., and the German telephone giant Deutsche Telekom A.G., creates the largest and most financially powerful support group for any computer on-line service to date. And, at least on paper, it makes America Online the dominant force in Europe's fast-developing interactive market.
11/22/1995	Germans Join America Online In Europe Deal	"The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had reconsidered a plan to cap enrollment for its Microsoft Network on-line service at its current level of 525,000 subscribers and would continue to look for more business. Microsoft's service is offered to people who buy the Windows 95 program. Keeping the service open to new customers is important for Microsoft as the holiday period arrives, said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with Arlen Communications Inc., a consulting firm in Bethesda, Md. """"To blow the opportunity to sell to hundreds of thousands of new users of Windows 95 in the Christmas stocking would have been a major problem,"""" he said."
11/21/1995	MICROSOFT TO ACCEPT MORE ON-LINE USERS	THE recent announcement that Michael Kinsley, the former New Republic editor, had agreed to create an Internet-based magazine for Microsoft started the media industry's beehive humming over the future of the World Wide Web as a medium for a new generation of magazine publishers. The magazine industry, like all parts of the media, is eager to digitize its offerings and display them on line. But despite the buzz over Mr. Kinsley's move to Microsoft, print magazines for a general readership will not make a smooth transition to the Web.
11/20/1995	The Web draws more magazines despite drawbacks (like a lack of profits).	Until three months ago, Union City schools were being monitored by the state, one step away from a Department of Education takeover like those in Newark, Paterson and neighboring Jersey City. But after several reforms, the monitoring  was lifted. Now, one of the district's middle schools has come even further. Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, has recognized the middle school as national leader in the use of technology in education. Mary Masengale, Microsoft's marketing manager, said the company was impressed by Christopher Columbus School's Interactive Multimedia Education Trial, in which students are provided with personal computers at home, linked in a single network to fellow students, their teachers, and computers they use in school.   STEVE STRUNSKY
11/19/1995	IN BRIEF;School Makes Strides With Computer Network	"Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., reduced by a third yesterday its forecast of Windows 95 shipments this year, saying sales of the Microsoft Corporation's operating system were slower than expected. Dataquest, a unit of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, said that Microsoft would ship fewer than 20 million copies by the end of the year, down from a projection of 30 million. Microsoft's shares fell $4.125 yesterday, to $89.875, as about 12.2 million shares were traded on Nasdaq. The slide was attributed primarily to a reduction in the stock's rating by Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company. Mr. Sherlund said Microsoft faced """"a serious threat"""" from smaller, more nimble companies in Internet software."
11/17/1995	LOWER ESTIMATE FOR SHIPMENTS OF WINDOWS 95	LIKE it or not, you have to use a mouse. Both Windows and Macintosh systems offer keyboard substitutes, but the mouse is unavoidable some of the time. Besides, why learn dozens of key commands? It is not the days of DOS anymore. The mouse need not be one of those bars of soap with a ball on the bottom, one or more buttons on top, and a tail to attach it to the computer. The Macintosh Quadra 660AV on which this is being written has the Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II, a smooth beast with one button. The Zeos 486/DX2/66 next to it is equipped with a Kensington Expert Mouse, actually a trackball with its poolball-sized controller on top and buttons to left and right. Downstairs, the Zeos 486 Contenda subnotebook has an awkward little trackball at the upper right of the keyboard, and the Macintosh Powerbook 540C has a trackpad, a surface that senses the movements of a finger.
11/14/1995	Mice That Don't Necessarily Look Like Mice	Apple Computer Inc. was the nation's largest maker of personal computers in the third quarter, according to surveys to be released on Monday by two leading market-research companies, Dataquest and the International Data Corporation. Apple had led the industry in the 1980's and early 1990's. Since then, its market share has significantly declined.
11/8/1995	Market Place;A Chip Order Is Cut. Result: Technology Stocks Reel.	In an indication that demand may be slowing for some types of personal computers and the parts used to build them, Cirrus Logic Inc. said yesterday that one of its largest clients had too much inventory and was reducing orders for the graphics and audio computer chips that account for the largest part of Cirrus's sales and profits.
11/7/1995	Kinsley Hired for New Microsoft Magazine	"The Microsoft Corporation has recruited Michael Kinsley, former editor of The New Republic and co-host of CNN's """"Crossfire,"""" to start a new on-line magazine of commentary on news, politics and culture. The 44-year-old Mr. Kinsley said many of the details of the planned electronic magazine had yet to be worked out, including when it would be started. The magazine will be distributed over the Internet's World Wide Web and on the Microsoft Network, the software maker's on-line service begun late in August."
11/5/1995	MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM	John Dodge connected to the Internet using software from a Microsoft competitor, Compuserve's Internet in a Box. Not anymore -- Windows 95 silently disabled a key piece of his setup and made it too difficult for him to reinstall it. Dodge is no novice. He is senior executive editor of the trade journal PC Week and so had access to the highest-level support engineers. But life is short and even software professionals learn to take the path of least resistance -- in this case, the path leading to Microsoft. He has become a regular user of the new Microsoft Network, though he has trouble with its Internet features.
10/31/1995	Now, the Check Is in the Modem	Use the right software, and your computer can do some banking tricks that most automated teller machines cannot. The latest versions of two popular personal finance packages have arrived: Quicken version 5 from Intuit Inc. and Microsoft Money for Windows 95 from the obvious suspect. When connected to a modem and a participating bank, the programs can capture banking and credit card statements, transfer funds between accounts, tell you which checks have cleared, and pay bills automatically or on request. On-line banking has been available for years, but few consumers have bothered to try it. Some new wrinkles are beginning to make the idea seem more attractive. For one thing, although some banks are charging as much as $15 a month for these services, others, like Citibank and Chase, have seen fit to offer the services to many account-holders at no cost. For another, the information that can be downloaded for credit and debit cards includes the name (and sometimes the business category) of the payee. What that means is that suddenly programs like Quicken and Money can help you organize your shoebox of credit slips without making you type all the information in. The programs can even categorize some transaction, thanks to Standard Industrial Classification (S.I.C.) codes.
10/31/1995	Novell to Sell Wordperfect Software Line	Novell Inc. said today that it intended to sell its struggling Wordperfect line of software applications, which it acquired only 18 months ago in an $855 million stock swap. Novell said it was holding discussions with several companies and expected to close a sale by the end of January.
10/23/1995	Dear Mr. Gates: My Wife Isn't Buying the 'Bug' Story	An executive E-mails a business proposal to a colleague. Hidden in the file, much to the executive's amazement (and the colleague's), is a less discreet proposal to the colleague's spouse. Technology and psychology collide with a thud.

10/23/1995	Landor to Create Microsoft Packaging	The Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash., has named Landor & Associates in San Francisco to create packaging for its software products. Though the billings were not disclosed, USA Today estimated them at $10 million to $15 million. Peter Allen, a spokesman for Landor, the corporate-identity and brand-consulting company that is a unit of Young & Rubicam Inc. of New York, confirmed a report of the assignment last week in USA Today. Though he would not elaborate on the details of the assignment, he said there were no plans for Landor to revise the current Microsoft corporate identity or to redesign its Windows 95.

He needs to to discuss a matter with his company's three senior executives. But rather than scheduling a meeting and heading down the hallway of Iris Associates to a conference room, he remains seated. Ozzie moves the cursor across the checkerboard-like screen and clicks on a square that says """"Executive Washroom."""" He types his comments into a private electronic bulletin board. Now Ozzie is curious about what everyone is gossiping about, so he clicks on the square nicknamed the """"water-cooler discussion."""" An employee just had a baby. Others analyze an International Business Machines Corporation television advertisement in which monks hold a telepathic conversation about Notes, the powerful office networking program. Ozzie is also using Notes, which his software development team has spent the last 10 years creating."
10/18/1995	Earnings Up 58% in Quarter For Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation proved the naysayers wrong yesterday with a jump in earnings of nearly 58 percent for the quarter, comfortably exceeding the consensus estimate on Wall Street. Microsoft said it sold 7 million copies of its Windows 95 operating system since its release on Aug. 23, far more than software industry analysts had predicted as recently as last week.
10/16/1995	Not All May Enter Brave New E-World	"To the Editor: Re """"Huge Photo Archive Bought by the Chairman of Microsoft"""" (front page, Oct. 11): The purchase of the Bettmann Archive by William H. Gates may not """"democratize art and scholarship, enabling people who could never travel to the Library of Congress or the Hermitage to sample their intellectual treasures."""" Because Mr. Gates intends to digitize these photographs for his on-line services, the images will be available only to those able to pay. Will this serve democracy?"
10/16/1995	Market Place;The Spotlight Again Turns To Microsoft	For technology investors, the really big shoe falls tomorrow, when the Microsoft Corporation reports its first-quarter financial results. The key question is whether Windows 95, the operating system Microsoft introduced to much fanfare on Aug. 23, is selling as well as anticipated. And the answer, when it comes, will resound well beyond Microsoft.

10/15/1995	Yes, Virginia, Microsoft and Intel Can Be Disappointing	THIS week, Intel and Microsoft, twin gorillas of the technology industry, will tell shareholders how much money they earned in the quarter just ended. The amounts undoubtedly will be impressive. Impressive to the average investor, that is, but perhaps not to the tea-leaf readers on Wall Street, who can find disappointment in the most upbeat report of corporate profits or forecast of future business trends.
10/11/1995	Huge Photo Archive Bought By the Chairman of Microsoft	William H. Gates, the software billionaire and champion of 21st-century technology, has purchased the Bettmann Archive, whose millions of historical photographs are a visual chronicle of the 20th century.
10/10/1995	Deleted, but Not Gone or Forgotten	DELETING a computer file is usually like sweeping dirt under the rug. The file, like the dirt, is still there; it just takes a little extra effort to see it. This longstanding peculiarity of most operating systems often lets files be resurrected after they have been deleted, as miscreants and errant typists have been surprised or delighted to learn. But there are scarier byproducts, including the unintended transfer of data to friends, enemies and the world at large.
10/9/1995	Technology	"WHEN the Internet's original creators decided to publish their networking standards -- called the Internet Protocol -- so that any computer could connect to the network, they certainly had no idea that almost 30 years later, their decision would provide the first real lever to pry the Microsoft-Intel duopoly from its leadership role. But this very prospect is why one well-known technology investor was able to make a speech last week that might have caused him to be laughed off the stage a year ago. He called it, """"Why Microsoft and Intel Don't Matter Anymore."
10/8/1995	Foreign Affairs; Foreign Policy 3.1	"On the front page of The Financial Times the other day was a picture that caught my eye. It showed Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, holding talks with Jiang Zemin, the President of China. The caption made it sound like any meeting of world leaders. It said the two men held """"very cordial"""" talks, in contrast with their """"frosty"""" summit of 18 months ago. Bill Gates has met Jiang Zemin twice in 18 months. Hmmmmmm, that's once more than Bill Clinton. That's no accident. The Chinese believe they need Bill G. more than they need Bill C. Which raises an interesting question: Does Microsoft have a foreign policy?"
10/3/1995	PRICES OF SOME SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CUT BY MICROSOFT	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had reduced prices on some home software products, cutting the prices consumers will pay by as much as 45 percent. Microsoft will offer more than 30 titles for less than $50 each and some for as little as $29.99. A Microsoft spokesman said the new pricing did not apply to Windows 95 software. The company, based in Redmond, Wash., said it based the cuts on research and in-store tests in which some retailers' sales increased when prices were cut.
9/28/1995	Microsoft-Visa On-Line Plan Draws the Ire of Competitors	Microsoft and Visa International proposed an industry software standard for on-line payments and financial transactions yesterday, but opposition from key companies could lead to a standards war that impedes the rollout of electronic commerce over the Internet. The standard, which is based on Visa's current credit-card transaction technology used in thousands of stores, restaurants and other establishments around the world, is intended to guarantee the security and privacy of payments and purchases made via computer networks.
9/28/1995	I.B.M. Plans to Consolidate OS/2 Development in Texas	In a move aimed at shoring up its struggling OS/2 operating system software, I.B.M. will relocate 1,100 software developers and other personnel from Boca Raton, Fla., to Austin, Tex., the company told employees yesterday. The move will consolidate OS/2 development in a single location, something that many analysts said was long overdue. Virtually all the software competitors of the International Business Machines Corporation, notably the Microsoft Corporation, develop their products in one place, while I.B.M.'s OS/2 efforts have been divided between Florida and Texas for years.
9/26/1995	MCI TO ANNOUNCE MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT	The MCI Communications Corrporation plans to announce a joint-marketing agreement today with the Microsoft Corporation to provide computer networks that link offices hundreds of miles apart. Large corporations typically have in-house experts who assemble the package of telephone services and software necessary to knit together such a network of data-sharing computers. C. David Sutton, an MCI spokesman, said the alliance with Microsoft would try to provide that same system-building expertise to smaller businesses. He declined to provide further details. The move comes less than a week after MCI bought computer network consultant SHL Systemhouse Inc. for $1 billion.
9/26/1995	At Home Alone With Windows 95	"THE last sentient being in the universe not to have installed Microsoft Windows 95 finally took the plunge. The Federal Express truck carrying the $89.95 upgrade on a CD-ROM arrived at home late on a weekday morning. After finishing my coffee and the paper, I unwrapped the package and carried the disk and 95-page manual up to the home office as the town sirens were announcing that it was noon. Following instructions, I started my current version of Windows, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, on the trusty 486/66, inserted the disk into its drive, selected Run from the File menu, and typed """"D:win95setup."""" The program said it was checking the system, and the screen went blank. After a few minutes, with no sign that either the CD-ROM or the hard disk was doing anything, I reset the computer."
9/25/1995	Staking Claim in Alternative Software on the Internet	James Gosling wants to make the computer software world safe for diversity. In his view, and in the view of many other people in the industry, the software giant Microsoft is close to crowding out all its competition.
9/20/1995	MTEL INTRODUCES TWO-WAY PAGING SERVICE	The Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corporation said yesterday that its Skytel unit had introduced the nation's first two-way paging service that will allow users to reply to a beep or page. In addition, Hewlett-Packard, MCI Communications, Microsoft, Motorola and Sony Electronics have formed agreements with Skytel to develop and sell products and applications for the service, called Skytel 2-Way. With two-way paging, Mtel, based in Jackson, Miss., hopes to gain an edge on its competitors, including Paging Network Inc., the largest United States paging company. Skytel 2-Way service is initially available in 50 metropolitan markets.
9/18/1995	Software Making Operating Systems Irrelevant	"To the Editor: """"Apple Holds School Market, Despite Decline"""" (Business Day, Sept. 11) implies that Microsoft's Windows 95 will become the only operating system for computers, replacing Apple Computer's Macintosh."
9/18/1995	Novell Readies a Response to Windows	It's never easy getting recognition as No. 2, and during the last few weeks Novell Inc. has had an especially hard time being heard above the clamor and the Rolling Stones backbeat of Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 rollout. But this week Novell, the world's second-largest producer of personal computer software, intends to raise its voice. In a presentation to Wall Street analysts on Thursday, Novell's chief executive, Robert Frankenberg, plans to articulate a strategy for protecting the company's lead in the one part of the PC software market that Microsoft does not yet dominate: corporate computer networks.
9/16/1995	Computer Fires Set Apple Back At Crucial Time	For months, Apple Computer Inc. had been contending that once consumers looked at Microsoft's new Windows 95 software, the comparison would help Apple's own business catch fire. Now, in a sense, its prophecy has come true, and the company is less than delighted. Some of Apple's newest portable machines have burst into flames, and the company is recalling them.
9/12/1995	'Innocent' Files Can Carry a Virus	A NEW kind of computer virus has descended upon the world. How easy is it to create one? Fifteen minutes after opening a Microsoft Word reference manual, I had cranked out a one-line program that could eliminate crucial system files from a hard drive. After an hour I had adapted the program to run automatically whenever anyone opened a file called HELPFUL.DOC. By bedtime I had figured out how to get this file to transmogrify Word itself so it would embed my trick program in any document it opened. In an evening, I had created a virus of my very own. This is scary stuff. Lacking the skill and knowledge to create a classic computer virus, I managed to put together this new kind with relative ease. Scarier still is that if I can do it, millions of others can too.
9/5/1995	Gates Awaits A Turner Move	"William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, said today that talks with Turner Broadcasting System about possible partnerships were on hold because of Turner's merger discussions with Time Warner Inc. """"We'll pause to let them get on with it,"""" Mr. Gates said at an information technology conference in Paris."
8/29/1995	Gas-Guzzlers Still Cruise Offices	COMPUTER programs for basic jobs like typing and counting are beginning to resemble cars of the early 60's. Icons, buttons and toolbars have become the chrome, tailfins and fuzzy dice of our time. They are bolted onto vehicles that guzzle memory, hog hard disk parking space and come with more promotion than acceleration. Microsoft Office 95 is the first major office software suite adapted for a certain new operating system you may have heard of. What Office 95 reveals is that Windows 95 is no panacea. Current users are likely to be mildly disappointed when they discover how little the program and its performance have changed. Others may wonder why the Microsoft Corporation continues to graft features onto existing programs rather than coming up with truly new ones. Of course, the last time the company came up with something new, it turned out to be called Bob.
8/28/1995	Trying to Bring Journalism With Capital 'J' to Cyberspace	"After a decade as a producer at NBC's """"Today"""" show, Allison Davis had no plans to leave. Ms. Davis, a 42-year-old mother of two, liked the early morning hours and ever-changing lineup of stories. But NBC News executives made her an intriguing offer: she could not only create and produce her own program, but invent new ways of packaging and presenting the news."
8/28/1995	Windows 95	The introduction of Microsoft's new Windows 95 operating system was a truly paradigm-shifting moment. Software took on the aura of a celebrity. And like all celebrities, the program and its corporate creator, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, were ready targets for the nation's best cartoonists. Herewith their take, the final word on the introduction of Windows 95.
8/28/1995	Permanent Task of Office Temps: Learning to Use New Software	"To William Hamilton, the Microsoft Corporation's new Windows 95 software is more than just another hyped new technology trying to revolutionize the American office. It's another new technology to master -- fast. Mr. Hamilton is an office """"temp,"""" one of the hordes of hourly workers on call to fill in for vacationing secretaries, to assist busy bookkeepers or to pitch in on a particularly heavy load of word processing. For him and millions of others like him, Microsoft's new software program means going back to class for a crash course or risk losing chances at extra work and higher pay."
8/27/1995	Windows 95: Hoopla To Hooopla to Hoooopla	AT 12:01 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 25, the entire planet breathed a collective sigh of relief as Bill Gates Day officially came to an end. A seemingly interminable orgy of self-congratulation, masquerading as the introduction of Microsoft's new Windows 95 software, finally, mercifully reached its conclusion. Jay Leno could now go back to being an affable talk-show host instead of a shill. The Empire State Building could return to its normal coloration. The guy who clambered down the face of a Toronto office tower clutching a Windows 95-equipped laptop could go back to his day job. Ditto the Aussie drag queen who got gussied up in a gown made entirely of CD-ROM's to help draw attention to Microsoft's sexy new product. After months and months of shameless hype, the world could now return to normal.
8/27/1995	Flying Through Windows	Airlines keep telling passengers not to play with their personal computers, at least during takeoff and landing, but that hasn't stopped American Airlines from offering coupons worth from $45 to $95 off a round-trip flight to anyone who buys the Windows 95 software at a CompUSA store. It must be purchased by Sept. 30, and other restrictions apply. Information: (800) 266-7872.
8/26/1995	Bill Gates's Carnival	Hand it to Bill Gates. The canny chairman of Microsoft orchestrated one of the noisiest product introductions in Madison Avenue history with the debut this week of Windows 95, the new operating-system software for personal computers. With lavish spending, Mr. Gates cranked up a mighty publicity Wurlitzer that featured everything from Microsoft-subsidized free copies of The Times of London to a blur of television appearances by the normally reclusive Microsoft chief. It was not easy to tell whether the buyers who stormed into stores at midnight Wednesday, when Windows 95 first went on sale, were propelled simply by the international promotional blitz or genuinely thought the next phase of the computer age was dawning.
8/25/1995	So Much Stock, but So Little Liquidity	Bill Gates as a broke technophobe? Only on Madison Avenue. In a humorous sideshow to the hoopla surrounding Microsoft's introduction of Windows 95, Mr. Gates, the company's chief executive, is featured in a television commercial for Coca-Cola Classic.
8/25/1995	Snubbed at Windows Party? Log On the Internet	"It was a beautiful day in Redmond, Wash., where Microsoft's Windows 95 was officially introduced. In the main tent, Jay Leno's quips with William H. Gates were amusing. Outside, waterfowl paddled on Lake Bill, a pond in the middle of the Microsoft office campus. Commemorative T-shirt sales were brisk. Mick Jagger sounded great on """"Start Me Up,"""" the Windows 95 theme song. And best of all, one did not have to travel to Washington to take part in the festivities. All the events, except the day's sunshine and cool breezes, were re-created on the global Internet almost as soon as they happened, letting thousands of people who wanted to attend the software party -- whether to cheer or jeer -- do so via PC."
8/25/1995	Sales Seem Brisk As Windows 95 Hits the Shelves	Now comes the $150 million question: Will the dogs eat the dog food? That's what the software developers at the Microsoft Corporation traditionally ask themselves when a new program finally hits the market. And in the case of Windows 95, which went on sale today backed by a $150 million global marketing campaign, the early signs were promising.
8/24/1995	Software makes strange bedfellows in Britain as Microsoft and Murdoch team to push Windows 95.	IN the computer software business, the Microsoft Corporation is not known for treading lightly. In the newspaper business, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is not known for keeping a low profile. And together they have cooked up a promotion for the British introduction of Microsoft's Windows 95 software that stands out even among the tidal waves of hype generated by the product. In a marketing deal that appears to have no parallel, the News Corporation is giving away copies of its British flagship paper, The Times of London, here today. The paper is printing 1.5 million copies, 845,000 more than it usually sells.
8/24/1995	Midnight Sales Frenzy Ushers in Windows 95	"Marin Pesa, a 24-year-old plumber, had not planned to spend last night's witching hour in a jostling scrum of technophiles surrounding a waist-high pile of Windows 95 software boxes at the CompUSA store in midtown Manhattan. But """"The hype got me here,"""" he acknowledged."
8/23/1995	Microsoft Seen Weighing $1 Billion Turner Stake	Negotiations between the Microsoft Corporation and Turner Broadcasting System are proceeding and involve an equity investment in Turner of about $1 billion, a person familiar with the discussions said yesterday. The person added that the companies were also discussing a joint venture in which Turner's library of movies and its other news and entertainment programming would be used for CD-ROM products, on-line services and other efforts by Microsoft.
8/22/1995	Intriguing Promises From Apple	WINDOWS 95, the system software upgrade that will finally be released this week by the Microsoft Corporation, has a number of keen and spiffy new features that will delight anyone who has never used an Apple Macintosh. Once they install Windows 95 and spend hundreds of dollars replacing their existing applications with Windows-95-compliant versions, Microsoft's customers will be able to use long file names; organize files in nested folders; use a mouse to drag files from one window on screen to another; add new peripherals without needing an electrical engineering degree, and so on.
8/22/1995	Judge Clears Antitrust Pact For Microsoft	A central chapter in the Government's investigation of the Microsoft Corporation was finally closed yesterday, when a Federal judge approved the Justice Department's 1994 antitrust settlement with the company. The approving nod from Judge Thomas P. Jackson was not a surprise. Nor did yesterday's action in a Federal District Court in Washington end the Government's scrutiny of Microsoft. The Justice Department continues to investigate Microsoft's use of its next-generation operating system, Windows 95, to market the company's new on-line service.
8/21/1995	A Windows 95 tour is about to hit the road, but Bill Gates isn't at the wheel. Is the CB radio working?	WITH Windows 95 about to be unleashed on a suspecting world, many marketers think the first customers will mostly be individuals, not businesses. Companies of various stripes make up three-quarters of the potential market, but they may take months if not years to decide whether to buy the Microsoft upgrade. How can Microsoft and its allies get them to pick up the pace?
8/21/1995	I.B.M.-Microsoft Feud Roils a Trade Show	The simmering hostility between I.B.M. and its onetime partner, the Microsoft Corporation, burst into the open last week, after I.B.M. disclosed that Microsoft had put pressure on the organizers of an industry trade show to remove one of I.B.M.'s top software executives from the program. Leland R. Reiswig Jr., head of the International Business Machines Corporation's personal software products division and an outspoken critic of Microsoft's Windows software, was scheduled to deliver the closing keynote speech at the Windows Solutions trade show in San Francisco on September 1.
8/18/1995	Microsoft Throws Stones Into Its Windows 95 Ads	"The Microsoft Corporation has bought the rights to a Rolling Stones song, """"Start Me Up,"""" for use in an advertising campaign for the company's new operating system software, Windows 95. The Financial Times reported yesterday that the company paid several million dollars for the song, considered a high price in advertising. A spokeswoman for Microsoft said that the price was """"a couple million,"""" but declined to disclose details."
8/17/1995	Compaq Cuts Its PC Prices In Effort to Widen Its Lead	In the opening gambit of what is expected to be a fierce competition among personal-computer manufacturers, the Compaq Computer Corporation reduced prices yesterday on its line of office and home computers by as much as 25 percent. Compaq also introduced several new models featuring the Intel Corporation's most powerful Pentium microprocessor and said that it would offer more storage capacity on its commercial machines to make room for the new Windows 95 operating system and the heftier new application programs that run on it. Price cuts are not unusual this time of year in the personal computer industry, as manufacturers try to reduce inventory to make room for their new fall lines. Apple Computer recently lowered its prices, and most other Compaq rivals are expected to announce their own price cuts within days.
8/17/1995	A Broadening of Microsoft Decree Is Asked	An industry trade group asked a Federal judge today to broaden the terms of the Government's antitrust settlement with the Microsoft Corporation to include its Windows NT program for corporate computer networks. The request, by the Computer and Communications Industry Association, is the latest twist in the Justice Department's attempt to get judicial approval for a consent decree with Microsoft that was announced more than a year ago.
8/15/1995	DIGITAL EQUIPMENT'S OFFICER JOINS MICROSOFT RESEARCH	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that Gordon Bell, a former head of research and development at the Digital Equipment Corporation, had joined its research team. Mr. Bell, 60, is credited as the inventor of the VAX minicomputer and one of the architects of the Internet. He will will help Microsoft explore the use of video and high-speed networks in video conference technology, the company said. Bell also will help Microsoft develop software for large computer networks.
8/14/1995	Steve Case At a Crossroad	Steve Case knows from painful experience how quickly technology markets can shift, destroying a once-promising business. In 1983, Mr. Case left a good marketing job at Pepsico Inc. to try to cash in on the latest trend in consumer technology, the Atari video game. So he joined a fledgling company that was starting an on-line service for users of the popular Atari computer-game machines.
8/14/1995	In Quest of CBS, Turner Meets Microsoft Chief	It has been a hectic month for Ted Turner. In his continuing quest to buy CBS Inc., the chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System recently met with William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, to discuss Microsoft's investing in Turner Broadcasting, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Mr. Turner is said to be seeking several billion dollars that would enable him to make a bid for CBS, which Westinghouse recently agreed to buy for $5.4 billion and which Mr. Turner has coveted since the 1980's.
8/12/1995	PC QUOTE STOCK SOARS ON NEWS OF MICROSOFT TIE	The price on PC Quote Inc. shares almost tripled, closing yesterday at a two-year high, after the company said it would provide market data to the Microsoft Corporation's Microsoft Network. Microsoft Network is the on-line service set to be started in connection with the new Windows 95 operating system. PC Quote rose $4.125, to $7, in trading of 862,800 shares, about 41 times its three-month daily average. It was the seventh most actively traded stock on the American Stock Exchange. The Chicago-based provider of securities information and news said delayed market quotes will be available to Microsoft Network users beginning Aug. 21.
8/9/1995	U.S. Won't Challenge Microsoft Network Before Its Debut	The Justice Department removed a cloud of uncertainty yesterday from the Microsoft Corporation's plan to enter the on-line business, announcing that it would take no antitrust action before the Aug. 24 introduction of the Microsoft Network. The department indicated that its antitrust investigation would continue, but the decision removed the prospect of a last-minute showdown with Microsoft, which plans to start its new network on the same day that it begins selling its widely anticipated Windows 95 operating system software for personal computers. The company's plan to include access to the Microsoft Network as a feature of Windows 95 has raised antitrust concerns that it could use its dominance in the PC software market to achieve an unfair advantage in the on-line computer business.
8/9/1995	Windows 95 Shows Apple's Miscalculation	"To the Editor: """"Business Often Goes to the Swift, Not the Best"""" (Week in Review, Aug. 6), on the dominance of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system software over Apple misses essential aspects of the competition. The theory that aggressive and swift software marketing yielded long-term market control would be better applied to how Windows beat out the OS-2 operating system than to its competition with Apple."
8/8/1995	OS/2 No Longer at Home at Home	MICROSOFT Windows 95 is still vaporware and will be for another two weeks, but the fumes already appear to have claimed the first victim in the personal computer operating system wars. My copy of the OS/2 operating system, developed by International Business Machines, just went out the window.
8/7/1995	Corrections	An article in Business Day last Monday about the Microsoft Corporation's new Windows 95 operating system software misstated the date of the first Windows version. It was 1985, not 1990.
8/7/1995	Windows 95's Big Value May Be as a Lure to Network System	Is Windows 95 a decoy? For all the attention being paid to the Aug. 24 introduction of the Microsoft Corporation's updated personal computer operating system, some experts think the software's true strategic value to Microsoft is not the few billion dollars in sales it is expected to bring to the company over the next few years.
8/6/1995	Ideas & Trends; Business Often Goes to the Swift, Not the Best	"IT was Emerson, by most accounts, who said: Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door. And for a nation of optimists, inventors and entrepreneurs, the maxim embraces an American ideal -- smarts and hard work will be rewarded. Woolly-headed nonsense, according to some leading economists. """"It's naive to believe that efficient engineering solutions win in the marketplace,"""" declares Paul A. David, a professor at Stanford University and a senior research fellow at Oxford University's All Souls College. """"That view is not supported by the study of history."
8/3/1995	Microsoft and Digital in a Deal That Expands Partnership	The Microsoft Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation announced an agreement today aimed at helping both companies capture a bigger share of the fast-growing corporate market for computers and software. As part of the pact, Microsoft said it would contribute up to $100 million in a Digital training program to insure that Digital's engineers can develop and service products based on Microsoft's Windows NT technology. Windows NT is Microsoft's operating-system software for linking computers into so-called client-server networks.
8/1/1995	I.B.M. Chief Concedes OS/2 Has Lost Desktop War	"Just as a new battle for the heart of the desktop computer has begun, Louis V. Gerstner, the chief executive of I.B.M., appeared to concede defeat yesterday. In his annual session with analysts, Mr. Gerstner admitted what many industry watchers have been saying for years: that I.B.M. has failed in its multibillion-dollar attempt to establish an alternative to the Microsoft Corporation's stranglehold on the software that runs personal computers. Obsessing about operating systems is """"fighting the last war,"""" he told the group, later adding that it is """"too late to go after the desktop."""" """"We have to go on to the next thing,"""" he said. Mr. Gerstner's comments came only three weeks before Microsoft is to introduce Windows 95, the successor to the Windows and MS-DOS programs that now control about 80 percent of all personal computers. Most analysts believe that the new program will gain wide acceptance, cementing Microsoft's primacy in a market that it has dominated since 1980, when I.B.M. licensed MS-DOS for its first personal computer. I.B.M. has since tried to challenge Microsoft with a program called OS/2. Although many analysts say OS/2 is technologically superior to both the current version of Windows and the soon-to-be-released Windows 95, it has never caught on with more than a small minority of consumers. Some I.B.M. executives have argued that the introduction of Windows 95 will help OS/2 because consumers will be forced to make a change and will see the benefits of I.B.M.'s offering. But others within the company have countered that it would be futile and a waste of money to go head to head against Microsoft where it is strongest. Yesterday, for the first time, Mr. Gerstner appeared to side with those pragmatists. He said I.B.M. would aggressively sell OS/2 to large companies and institutions that use it on application servers, which allow networks of desktop computers to share a variety of computer programs. """"Our focus is in the large enterprise,"""" he said. OS/2 has dominated the market for such servers in recent years, but many analysts said the company was quickly losing ground to another Microsoft program, Windows NT. """"NT is displacing OS/2 servers extremely rapidly,"""" said Rob Enderle, a senior research analyst at Dataquest, an industry consultant based in San Jose, Calif. He estimated that I.B.M. had more than a 2-to-1 advantage at the beginning of the year in the number of servers running OS/2 compared with NT, but that Microsoft had probably pulled even and was likely to overtake I.B.M. by the end of the year. I.B.M. still has a chance, Mr. Enderle said, """"but it is narrowing fast."""" """"A lot of premier I.B.M. accounts have indicated that they will be pulling off OS/2 in the next 12 to 18 months,"""" he added. During his 90-minute session with analysts, Mr. Gerstner expanded on a theme that he has been warming to since he arrived at I.B.M. two years ago: that I.B.M. is now focused on providing value to its customers rather than simply foisting the latest technology on them. He said that the company had identified five groups of customers that it would now try to serve: large enterprises and institutions; small and medium-sized businesses; consumers; other hardware manufacturers, and resellers and other distributors. Asked if I.B.M.'s recent $3.5 billion acquisition of the Lotus Development Corporation was an admission that the company had failed to plan properly for its future, Mr. Gerstner admitted that it was. """"It is an indictment of things we did wrong in the past and I am glad that we had the opportunity to fix it,"""" he said. But he added that he and his management team now spend a lot of time thinking ahead. """"There is a very strong preoccupation in the company today to understand where the industry is going and get there first,"""" he said."
8/1/1995	Adding Up the Costs Of Using Windows 95	"THERE is only one sure way to know if you will be happy with Windows 95 on your machine: Install it. But the operating system is just the beginning. Before you rush out to place your order, consider some hidden costs: Memory and processor. Windows 95 can run on a 386DX machine with four megabytes of random access memory only if you think the word """"run"""" means """"crawl."""" A faster processor is nice, but more memory is mandatory. On any four-megabyte machine, few programs will work well; some, like the Microsoft Network, will not work at all. Microsoft recommends eight megabytes of RAM as a workable minimum; fair enough, but even on my 90 megahertz Pentium machine with 16 megabytes of RAM, no jury would convict applications of exceeding speed limits."
8/1/1995	Personal Computers: What Is Windows 95 Really Like?	OPERATING systems are essentially programs meant to run other programs. Once upon a time they had self-effacing names like DOS and CP/M and p-system, silently intervened between computer programs and the hardware on which they ran and were utterly alien to anyone outside the computer world. Times have changed. Now operating systems come with flashy handles like Warp and Windows, earn more notoriety than Kevin Costner movies and breed on-line brawls of religious ferocity. Although it will not be generally available until Aug. 24, the Microsoft Corporation's long-delayed Windows 95 has already become such a household name that it is mentioned facetiously in a radio commercial for Hawaiian Airlines.
7/31/1995	The real significance of Windows 95 is reaching the Web with a single click of the mouse.	IT'S damn the subpoenas, full speed ahead. Unless the Justice Department pulls the plug in the final countdown days before Aug. 24, the Microsoft Corporation is preparing to start its most ambitious, and potentially most lucrative, venture since Bill Gates won the job in 1980 of providing I.B.M. with a piece of software called DOS 1.0.
7/31/1995	Haven't heard of Windows 95? Where have you been hiding?	TO introduce Windows 95, the Microsoft Corporation is amassing almost every weapon in the advertising arsenal short of hiring planes to fly over computer stores towing banners that bear the address of its World Wide Web site. Microsoft plans to use traditional tactics like teaser ads to entice consumers into anticipating the computer operating system as much as a Super Bowl or a birthday party. It will also have cross-promotions with retailers and marketers of related products.
7/31/1995	Computer Users Told To Go Slow in Change Of Operating Systems	When it finally goes on sale on Aug. 24, Microsoft's Windows 95 will be better, faster and easier to use than any previous version of the software. So why is Brian Mott, a computer consultant to small and large companies, telling his clients not to buy? Wait till next year, Mr. Mott advises.
7/31/1995	Bracing for a Microsoft Onslaught, Apple Sees No Reason to Panic	In Silicon Valley it is fashionable to predict that the imminent arrival of Windows 95 spells the ultimate demise of Apple Computer Inc. A growing chorus of pundits and Wall Street analysts has zeroed in on Apple and its home-grown operating system as the biggest potential losers in the wake of the introduction, due in late August, of the Microsoft Corporation's updated computer operating system. Apple popularized the personal computer in the late 1970's and made computing much simpler with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. But its lead in simplicity will be narrowed by Windows 95.
7/31/1995	Windows of Opportunity for Microsoft	"REDMOND, Wash. The Microspft Corporation plans to begin selling its 272d software title on Aug. 24. But it is clear that Windows, 95, the latest version of the software that runs some 100 million of the world's personal computers, is much more than just another new product. Windows 95 is a sign of the times, already creating a stir in markets worldwide, in Washington and on Wall Street, an indication of the inroads the personal comptuer has made into contemporary commerce and culture. A video producer is churning out five million copies of a Windows 95 tape, convinced that sales of an instructional video on a software program will dwarf those of past best sellers, like the Cindy Crawford workout tapes. The test versions of the software that Microsoft has been circulating for months have received microscopic scrutiny, not only for technical flaws but even for political slights. One version had a map with a misdrawn Latin American border, bringing fiery protest from Peru, which is in a border dispute with Ecuador. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is racing to decide whether to stop Microsoft from using Windows 95 as a springboard for the company's new on-line service. And the surge in stock prices this year has been led by technology companies, partly in anticipation of increased sales of computer hardware and software that analysts expect in the wake of the Windows 95 introduction on Aug. 24. Should sales of the new Microsoft program lag behind expectations, the stock market may well tumble. The fascination, hype and controversy surrounding Windows 95 stems largely from the fact that PC's are now ubiquitous in the workplace and are fast becoming a mainstream consumer product. The $85- billion-a-year personal computer industry is recognized as a pillar of the American economy. And as a gateway to the Internet, cyberspace and multimedia, the personal computer affects everything from how people communicate with each other to how children are educated. Even Brad Chase, the 34-year-old architect of Microsoft's marketing strategy for Windows 95, says he is amazed by all the attention the product has received. And he readily admits that the phenomenon is only partly explained by the big-budget marketing campaign he has led for the last year from Microsoft's pine-covered corporate campus here, outside Seattle. """"The breadth of interest in Windows 95 is because of all these things, from the Internet to the Justice Department investigation, coming together, all these stars getting into line at once,"""" Mr. Chase said. """"Windows 95 is a lot more than software."""" And how is a single software program linked to all these larger trends and events? Simply put, because Windows 95 is a new operating system and because it is Microsoft's. An operating system controls the on-screen look of a personal computer and the keyboard-and-mouse steps required to use it, and more than 80 percent of all PC's use Microsoft's operating software. So when Microsoft overhauls its operating program, it is changing the language of personal computing. Windows 95, by all accounts, is the most significant change Microsoft has made in its operating program since 1990. That was the year the company introduced its first Windows system, which borrowed an approach from Apple Computer's Macintosh by enabling a user to point and click on graphical icons instead of typing arcane commands. Since then, Microsoft has improved Windows, notably with its Windows 3.1 version in 1992. But Windows 95 is an entirely new operating system built with 11 million lines of programming code, compared with 3 million lines for Windows 3.1. All operating systems have their irritating quirks and shortcomings, and Windows 95, priced at less than $100, is no exception. Some existing programs do not yet run smoothly on Windows 95, and it requires more computer hard-disk space and memory to use than the previous generation of Windows. But analysts agree that Windows 95 represents a big step forward in making computers less confusing for someone writing a report, browsing the Internet or installing a new printer. Technology purists point out that some of the new features of Microsoft's new system, like being able to have lengthy file names instead of the eight-character limit of Windows 3.1, are advantages that rival operating systems -- the Apple Macintosh and I.B.M.'s OS/2 -- have had for years. Yet even with a technical edge, Microsoft's competitors have not been able to challenge the company's dominance of the operating system market, which it attained shortly after I.B.M. chose Microsoft's Disk Operating System for the I.B.M. PC in 1980. By now, in the PC operating system market, Microsoft has no genuine rival. The company's extraordinary marketing campaign, with an estimated budget of $150 million, is intended less to fend off competition than to move computer companies and users -- quickly -- to the new industry standard, Windows 95. """"For Microsoft, the marketing campaign is essentially a $150 million insurance policy to make sure that nothing happens to prevent Windows 95 from becoming by far the most successful product in the history of the business,"""" said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. If Microsoft makes Windows 95 a success, it will have plenty of help from the rest of the personal computer industry. Dataquest, a market research firm, estimates that in addition to Microsoft's $150 million, other hardware and software companies, retailers and distributors will spend $350 million this year to market Windows 95 and their own Windows 95-related products. Other software makers, in particular, tend to have a hate-you/need-you relationship with Microsoft. As the dominant producer, Microsoft makes not only operating software but also applications like word processing programs, data bases, spreadsheets, educational software and games. So it is the chief rival of most applications-software companies in the industry. But because the software makers' products run on the Microsoft operating system, they have been rushing to develop products for the new Windows 95 platform. A successful rollout of Windows 95 in the early months is vital to Microsoft, both to its corporate pride and its profits. Analysts' sales estimates vary considerably for the last four months of 1995, following the Aug. 24 debut. At the high end, Dataquest is forecasting sales of 29 million copies this year. International Data Corporation, another research firm, predicts 20 million. Another firm, Inteco, estimates it will be only 14 million. At roughly $50 in revenue to Microsoft for each copy sold, the difference between a torrid and a not-so-fast rollout could make a striking difference in near-term revenues and profits. Selling 29 million copies this year means roughly $1.45 billion in revenue to Microsoft, while 14 million copies would be $700 million. Responsibility for seeing that the Windows 95 marketing goes quickly and smoothly rests largely on the shoulders of Mr. Chase, the general manager of Microsoft's personal systems division, and seven group product managers. They are all men in their early 30's -- seasoned veterans by Microsoft standards. They are mainly M.B.A.'s from places like Wharton, Harvard and Northwestern. Most started in other fields, then recognized that technology was the future, and headed to Redmond. Mr. Chase wrote the marketing blueprint one night, shortly before a March 1994 meeting with Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. It sketched out what Mr. Chase called the """"E-strategy"""" for Educate, Excite and Engage, and it explained that the personal computer market has broadened so much since the introduction of Windows 3.1 in 1992, nearly tenfold, that an entirely different approach was needed this time. And different it has been. The company has distributed 400,000 beta, or test, copies of Windows 95, many of them to corporate users licensed to put the software on more than one PC. By Aug. 24, an estimated million people will have used Windows 95 for nearly 75 million hours. This means that even before it officially hits the market, Windows 95 will have received more use than all but a few of the most successful software products receive in their entire several-year product cycles. For more than a year, Microsoft has been bringing software developers, PC makers, corporate customers and members of the computer press to Redmond for briefing and cajoling. The company presented demonstrations to 50,000 individual customers during a 23-city, three-month tour of the United States.. Microsoft sent the finished code for Windows 95 to factories on July 14. And the company has revved up seven times its normal production capacity, contracting with 12 plants and engaging a fleet of 500 trucks, to insure that the new product will be at 20,000 retail outlets, from CompUSA to Wal-Mart, on Aug. 24. Consumers are expected to move quickly to Windows 95, particularly since it will be preloaded on the machines produced for the Christmas season by manufacturers like Compaq, Packard Bell, Gateway and Dell. But corporate customers traditionally wait six to nine months to buy new operating systems, allowing the early programming bugs to be eliminated. To try to get companies to move quickly this time, Microsoft and distributors have offered large customers hundreds of free copies as an incentive to buy others. Companies that have agreed to deploy Windows 95 on many desktops by Aug. 24 include Ford, Dow Chemical, Sprint and Deloitte Touche. Yet it seems doubtful how quickly even the Microsoft marketing arsenal can prompt companies to move to Windows 95. Surveys show most companies would wait until next year to make the transition. """"There's no question about it,"""" Mr. Chase said, """"inertia is our biggest competitor."
7/31/1995	How the Software and the Network Stack Up	"SOFTWARE: THE DESKTOP Many of the technological improvements in Windows 95 mimick characteristics long available in Apple Computer's Macintosh operating system and I.B.M.'s OS/2 -- particularly the use of visual icons and task bars to make it faster and easier to operate the computer. All three operating systems now offer """"plug and play,"""" meaning that peripheral devices like printers and CD-ROM drives can be added with no need for the user to reconfigure the software. With Windows 95, users can do this only with software programs created specifically for it. Windows 95: The start button summons the initial menu of options. A sub-menu lets the user launch programs directly, instead of searching through several sub-directories, as the old Windows required. Users can add frequently needed applications to the task bar that always appears on the screen. Macintosh: There are several ways to start programs and organize files on the Macintosh. One way is the Apple menu. Another way is the launch pad, which made its debut last year in System 7.5. It is a round-up of icons for the user's most frequently accessed applications. OS/2: OS/2 also features a launch pad. The software also integrates so-called drag-and-drop mouse commands, which make it easy to fax or print a document, simply by dragging the document icon to the printer or fax icon. FILE MANAGEMENT With the Windows update, individual files are now handled much the same way in all three operating systems. The differences lie in efficiency. OS/2 offers true """"multi-tasking,"""" which means that the computer can perform several tasks simultaneously. Windows 95 offers true multi-tasking only when all of the programs in use are ones designed specifically for the new Windows. Otherwise, tasks like sending a fax can slow down other operations. Windows 95: The user can organize the files into folders and sub-folders of his or her choosing, displayed in a tree-and-branch format. Individual files created in the same program are all represented by the same icon, for easier visual identification. Macintosh: Windows 95's file-management approach is similar to the Macintosh's. Macintosh's visual desktop setup uses icons to represent the hard drive and other components, as well as a trash can for deleting files. OS/2: Files are organized in folders as icons, as shown above, or using the tree-and-branch motif. INTERNET ACCESS Unless the Justice Department intervenes, Microsoft plans to offer direct access to its new Microsoft Network and to the Internet through Windows 95. Apple offers Internet access through its own eWorld service. OS/2 offers Internet access through I.B.M.'s network. Windows 95: This is the Microsoft Network's E-mail screen. While most users choose services based on their content, they actually use plain-Jane tools such as E-mail most frequently. OS/2: The OS/2 interface allows for full use of the Internet, including the World Wide Web. A user dials into I.B.M.'s systema and the comptuer is automatically configured to use E-mail, the Web and other tools. THE NETWORKS: A COMPARISON On Aug. 24, the same day it begins selling Windows 95, Microsoft also plans to enter the on-line business with the Microsoft Network, known as MSN. Tables show how it will compare with the current leaders. MICROSOFT NETWORK LAYOUT Designed to be fully integrated with Windows 95, the Microsoft Network uses a visual navigation system very similar to that of the operating system. The network's on-line customer help and support service will also handle user questions about Windows 95. THE OPENING SCREEN -- Offers access to the five areas on the network. CONTENT -- The usual potpourri of chat rooms, film reviews and information. Some 100 content providers have signed up, including NBC News, the retailer Eddie Bauer and the basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, with ShaqWorld Online. NEWS MSN -- Today offers news bits, as well as information about the service, and provides links to other areas on the network. HELP AND REGISTRATION -- Provides on-line customer service for the Microsoft Network and allows customers to make changes to their accounts. On-line support for Windows 95 and other Microsoft programs is available through the Categories area."
7/24/1995	:New Microsoft network will offer a wealth of privacy.	GIVEN the intense scrutiny by government, press and competitors over the last few months, it seems unthinkable that anything has been left unsaid about the Microsoft Network. But in fact, very little has been made of the fact that MSN will be a global on-line service from the start -- Aug. 24, the day of the Windows 95 release. And even less has been said about MSN's design, which Microsoft has said complies with the new data-privacy rules that the European Union is expected to adopt in September. Two European Union members, France and Germany, already have adopted similar rules.
7/24/1995	For I.B.M. Faithful, Questions About Windows 95	"Every time I say I am an OS/2 user, I get immediately marginalized,"""" an elderly woman confided to a young man sitting next to her at last week's OS/2 World convention in Boston. """"It's amazing what saying you are an OS/2 user brings out in people."""" She could afford to bare her soul in public because she knew that she was surrounded by a sympathetic group: a few thousand devotees of I.B.M.'s long-overshadowed personal computer operating system."
7/20/1995	The Higher They Rise, the Harder . . .	Since the beginning of the year, mutual funds investing in technology stocks have made millions of American investors seem like geniuses. Thousands of funds, from specialists in technology companies to more general investment funds like the $48 billion Fidelity Magellan fund, have produced returns of more than 20 percent in the first half of this year by buying heavily in technology stocks. But yesterday afternoon, a decline that at first seemed like a temporary cooling of an overheated market sector took on the look of a full-fledged collapse before recovering a bit in the final 90 minutes of trading. Yesterday's 35.66-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology stocks, was the second worst in the index's history, measured in points, exceeded only by the 46.12-point decline on Oct. 19, 1987. But at the low point yesterday, the decline exceeded the 1987 number. Since closing Monday at 1,005.89, its first-ever finish above 1,000, the index has fallen 53.02 points, or 5.3 percent, to 952.87.
7/19/1995	Microsoft Speeding Its On-Line Service	Taking a step closer to a showdown with the Justice Department, the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that not only did it plan to include access to its new on-line service in the Windows 95 operating system next month, but that the service would also be fully linked to the Internet, several months earlier than expected. The announcements, made by the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates, at an industry conference in Long Beach, Calif., came on the eve of Microsoft's expected filing of a court brief challenging the Justice Department's latest request for information.
7/18/1995	Microsoft Has Strong Profit For Quarter	After its shares had closed at an all-time high yesterday, the Microsoft Corporation reported revenues and earnings for the quarter that were stronger than expected. The stock jumped $5.375, or 5 percent, to $109, in heavy Nasdaq trading following the company's confirmation late Friday that it had sent its often-delayed Windows 95 operating system to manufacturing plants.
7/17/1995	Apple Computer to Offer 2 New Macintosh Models	Apple Computer Inc. will introduce two Macintosh models today in its consumer-oriented Performa line, offering aggressive pricing and advanced multimedia features. The machines play to Apple's strengths in the publishing, education, multimedia and consumer markets. The two models, together with software and services aimed at specific market segments, will help Apple regain market share this year and next, Michael Spindler, Apple's president and chief executive, said at a news briefing. Rather than compete across the board with PC clones of dubious quality, Mr. Spindler said, Apple will focus its efforts. Though its overall market share is about 8.3 percent, in certain markets the Macintosh has a dominant share, and this can be increased, he said.
7/17/1995	Market Place; The Tech Stocks Defy Gravity and Rewrite Conventional Wisdom	Conventional wisdom has it that the second quarter brings a slump to the producers of computers, software, semiconductors and disk drives. Not so this year. With a few exceptions, the companies that have reported second-quarter results have met or exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates, sending already lofty prices of technology stock to new highs on an almost daily basis.
7/15/1995	Intuit Signs 19 Deals for Home-Banking Software	Intuit Inc. announced yesterday that 19 financial institutions, including many of the nation's largest banks, credit card companies and brokerage firms, would use its popular Quicken software for home banking services beginning this fall. The move signals the company's intent to compete aggressively with the Microsoft Corporation after the collapse in May of plans for the two companies to merge.
7/15/1995	WINDOWS 95 SENT TO MANUFACTURING PLANTS	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday sent the final version of its long-awaited Windows 95 operating system to its manufacturing plants. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said Windows 95 would be on retail shelves and pre-installed on personal computers on Aug. 24. Windows 95 is the latest version of the Windows operating system, the fundamental program that controls the basic functions of about 60 million personal computers worldwide. Microsoft, the world's biggest personal computer software company, will ship about 30 million copies of Windows 95 through the end of 1995, according to Dataquest Inc., a market researcher. Microsoft's stock jumped $3.50 a share yesterday, to $103.625 on the Nasdaq, a new 52-week high.
7/14/1995	U.S. Spells Out Antitrust Inquiry Into Microsoft	The Justice Department said today that the Microsoft Corporation might well be violating antitrust laws by including software for its new on-line network in Windows 95, its much-anticipated operating system for personal computers. The legal brief filed today by the department stops short of charging Microsoft with any legal violations, but it provides the most solid indication yet that the Government may try to force changes in Microsoft's new program. The brief was submitted by the Government in defense of its demand for more information from the giant software company.
7/11/1995	Microsoft Hits High on News Of Software	The Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that it would begin shipping an updated collection of its top-selling software applications on Aug. 24, the same day it is scheduled to release Windows 95, its next generation of operating system software for personal computers. Investors, which seem to view the future of dozens of computer hardware and software companies as riding on the success of Windows 95, responded by pushing Microsoft's stock to a record high.
7/7/1995	Chemical Aims to Expand Electronic Banking	Chemical Bank said yesterday that it would expand its electronic banking services beginning in October, including a new push into the home banking arena that it has tried unsuccessfully to develop for more than a decade. As part of the program, the bank announced an alliance with the Microsoft Corporation to provide money management software linked to Chemical's private computer network. Microsoft will help Chemical market the new services by providing it with names of registered users of Microsoft products in the bank's area, a spokesman for Microsoft said.
7/7/1995	Symantec Offers To Buy Delrina As Windows 95 Release Nears	The Symantec Corporation said today that it would acquire the Delrina Corporation, best known for its Winfax software, in a stock swap valued at $415 million. The deal would add Delrina's communications programs to the mix of utilities and programming tools produced by Symantec, which is based in Cupertino, Calif. The acquisition is the latest in a wave of software industry mergers. The consolidation is expected to increase as the Aug. 24 shipping date of the Microsoft Corporation's new Windows 95 operating system approaches. Windows 95 will incorporate many functions that were previously filled by separate application programs, often sold by other companies.
7/5/1995	Market Place; A selloff by Microsoft executives may be fallout from a failed deal.	MANY of the top executives of the Microsoft Corporation seem to be very eager to sell shares of the software giant as the introduction of the company's Windows 95 operating system nears. At the same time, as Microsoft's stock price has soared the company has cut back on purchases of its own stock. Figures released on Monday by the company showed that during the three months that ended June 30 it spent just $34 million on share repurchases. That was down from $104 million in the prior quarter and from a record $318 million in the last three months of 1994. It was the lowest figure for any quarter since the final three months of 1992, when the company did not repurchase any shares.
7/4/1995	MICROSOFT'S REPURCHASING OF STOCK TO CONTINUE	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would continue its stock repurchase program in the fiscal year that began on Saturday, but it did not say how many shares would be involved. The software giant, based in Redmond, Wash., said the program provided shares for its employee stock-option and stock-purchase plans. In the year that ended on Friday, Microsoft repurchased about 11.7 million shares for $698 million. The company said the size of its stock buyback in the 1996 fiscal year would hinge on the number of stock options employees exercise and other market factors. The stock closed yesterday at $90.9375, up 56.26 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
6/28/1995	An Early Flood Of Users Is Seen For Microsoft's On-Line Service	How popular will the Microsoft Corporation's new on-line service be? That is a question Microsoft's rivals, the Justice Department and many others are asking these days. To help find an answer, the Government has looked to a small private firm in Atlanta, Pipeline Communications Inc.
6/27/1995	Citing Abuse, Microsoft Sues U.S. About Its New Network	"Frustrated by the Justice Department's dogged pursuit, the Microsoft Corporation has turned the tables and taken the Government to court. Microsoft, portrayed by rivals as an all-powerful force in the software industry, filed a petition in Federal court last Friday that stated it was a beleaguered victim of a """"campaign of harassment"""" and """"abusive behavior"""" by the Department of Justice."
6/26/1995	Microsoft Grows in China	The Microsoft Corporation said that once again its sales in China were likely to double for the year, as they have annually since the company formally entered the country in 1992, the official China Daily reported. According to the paper, Bob Lu, Microsoft's marketing manager in China, said that demand for software was expected to be huge as China automates more of its offices. He declined to specify the company's sales in China, but said that Microsoft planned to expand the number of authorized dealers here to more than 300 this year.
6/26/1995	Video conferencing technology, hyped for so long, may finally be near.	HUMANS so rely on facial expressions to convey emotion that we usually try to replicate them, when we are separated by time and space, in other forms of communication. Early in the development of electronic mail, users invented emoticons -- sideways faces formed like this one : ) with the aid of punctuation marks -- as an antidote to the inevitable misunderstandings that result when people type at each other instead of talking face-to-face.
6/24/1995	Credit Cards On Internet Given a Lift	Hoping to make it as easy to buy things over the Internet as it is to push a button, Mastercard International and Visa International said yesterday that they had agreed to a standard for electronic credit card transactions. In effect, Mastercard has agreed to join -- with minor modifications -- a system that Visa was developing with the Microsoft Corporation. The system is intended to be open in that other card companies and software vendors will be invited to participate.
6/22/1995	U.S. Widening Inquiry Into Microsoft's On-Line Plans	The Justice Department has broadened its investigation of the Microsoft Corporation's plans for its new on-line network, issuing subpoenas this week to publishers, broadcasters and others who have signed up to be on it. The requests for documents from the information suppliers of the on-line service, Microsoft Network, signal a second step in the investigation. Two weeks ago, the Justice Department issued civil investigative demands -- the equivalent of subpoenas -- to Microsoft's rivals in the on-line business, including America Online Inc., H & R Block's Compuserve and Prodigy Services, the joint venture by I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck & Company.
6/20/1995	What's in a File Name? Confusion	A YEAR ago Windows 95 was known as Chicago and expected late in 1994. Since then a combination of curiosity, speculation, publicity and delay has made this operating system the cynosure of the computer business. Countering industry japes that the long-delayed product might not arrive before its name became history, the Microsoft Corporation has announced that Windows 95 will be available on Aug. 24, the date when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. Barring a similar cataclysm, it is safe to say that lots of people will be using Windows 95 before long. But few programs are fully compliant with Windows 95, and until new versions arrive beginning right after the Vesuvius anniversary, using Windows 95 is unlikely to be the joyful experience Microsoft would have you believe. Even when new programs do appear, mixing them with current models may produce confusion and possibly grief.
6/19/1995	Technology: ON LINE; Conspiracy buffs see things to worry about in Microsoft's electronic software registry.	THE Microsoft Corporation, already beleaguered by Federal regulators, judges and its software rivals, is under pressure from yet another source: the cyberspace rumor mill. Even as a Federal appeals court panel gave the company a victory last week, approving the 1994 consent decree between Microsoft and the Justice Department's antitrust division, conspiracy theorists continued to cast the company in a villain's role. The issue this time is not how much power Microsoft has but what it may do with it.
6/17/1995	Appeals Court Reinstates Microsoft Antitrust Settlement	In a victory for the Microsoft Corporation, a Federal appeals court reinstated the July 1994 antitrust settlement between the company and the Justice Department yesterday, ruling that a lower-court judge had overstepped his authority in rejecting it. The three-judge panel disqualified Judge Stanley Sporkin, who had rejected the settlement in February and ordered the case reassigned to a different judge, to be picked at random. It also ordered that the antitrust settlement be accepted in its current form.
6/15/1995	International Briefs; Microsoft's On-Line Plan Faces European Review	The Microsoft Corporation's plan to equip its forthcoming Windows 95 operating system with access to its new on-line service will be scrutinized by the European Commission, a commission director-general, Stefano Micossi, said yesterday.
6/15/1995	3 Software Makers Propose Rating System for Internet	Hoping to provide an alternative to legislation that would censor material posted on the Internet, three software companies yesterday proposed a voluntary rating system and an electronic filter that would allow parents and other individuals to block access to sexually explicit content. The three companies -- the Microsoft Corporation, Netscape Communications Inc. and Progressive Networks Inc. -- announced the move just as the Senate approved a measure that would make it a criminal act to knowingly distribute obscene material over computer networks.
6/15/1995	Microsoft Is Reported in Japanese Venture	"The Microsoft Corporation will set up a venture this month with the Softbank Corporation, a Japanese software company, to develop game software for Microsoft's Windows 95, a next-generation operating system, a newspaper reported today. Microsoft will provide more than half of the $11.9 million capital for the new company, tentatively named """"Gamebank,"""" according to the article in the financial newspaper, Nihon Keizai. The move would allow Japanese game software to be played on other personal computers. Executives at Softbank and Microsoft's Tokyo office declined to comment on the report."
6/13/1995	New Data, New Wine, New Snags for Users	"TWO new CD-ROM programs looked like fun. The Beer Hunter, a $39.95 program from the Discovery Channel, and the Microsoft Wine Guide (also about $39.95) were perfect for a Sunday in spring. The star of the Beer Hunter is Michael Jackson, a Briton who presents a guide to nearly 200 American brews in video, audio and text. I started with that. As instructed, I put the CD-ROM in, went to """"run"""" in the """"file"""" menu and then typed """"d:setup.exe."""" The program informed me that one or more Visual Basic applications were running, and that I would have to close them."
6/12/1995	Outflanking Goliath; Unable to Overcome Microsoft Windows, I.B.M. Tries an End Run With Lotus Notes	By succeeding in its bid for the desktop software maker Lotus Development, has I.B.M signaled the end of its quixotic quest to develop a mass market for its own beleaguered OS/2 software? I.B.M. says no, but many analysts disagree, and they point to no less of an authority than Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the company.
6/12/1995	Microsoft is worried that the Justice Department may force a delay in Windows 95.	FOR the Microsoft Corporation, the biggest financial worry about the Justice Department's investigation of the company's plans to market its new on-line service is the risk the inquiry poses to its new operating system, Windows 95. Microsoft executives stressed on Friday that they had no intention of altering plans to package the access software for its on-line service, Microsoft Network, with Windows 95, which is scheduled to be released in August.
6/12/1995	Microsoft Developing Electronic Cash Card	The Microsoft Corporation's dominant software business often seems like a license to print money. But now the company wants to go a step further and make cash itself, at least the electronic kind. Microsoft is developing a plan to offer plastic cards embedded with microchips, known as smart cards, that can be used to make payments, said Warren T. Dent, the director of business development for the company's consumer systems division.
6/12/1995	I.B.M. WINS LOTUS AS OFFER IS RAISED ABOVE $3.5 BILLION	The Lotus Development Corporation capitulated yesterday to I.B.M's initially hostile takeover bid, but not before persuading I.B.M. to raise its price to more than $3.5 billion in cash -- and to guarantee the innovative software manufacturer a degree of independence extremely unusual in what was once one of the country's most hide-bound corporations. After International Business Machines and Lotus officials worked out the details of the corporate union, Lotus's six-person board met on Saturday and voted to accept the I.B.M. offer of $64 a share, which was $4 a share, or about $220 million, more than the company first offered last week.
6/10/1995	Microsoft Defends Its On-Line Plans	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that despite a Justice Department investigation it had no intention of altering its plans for entering the fast-growing computer on-line services business in August. The Justice Department is looking at whether Microsoft's plan to bundle the access software for its on-line service onto the upgrade of its popular Windows operating system, due in August, would give the big software company an unfair advantage in the on-line business.
6/9/1995	Microsoft's On-Line Plan Is Scrutinized	"It may not be a full-blown investigation yet, but the Justice Department is giving Microsoft's plans to enter the commercial on-line business in August a hard look. In the last two weeks, Justice Department officials have been asking questions of executives of services like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy and to their lawyers, some of the people questioned say. So while Microsoft says it knows of no """"open investigation"""" of its coming on-line service, the Microsoft Network, and the Justice Department isn't saying, the inquiries are being made even if the I-word -- investigation -- is avoided."
6/8/1995	I.B.M.'s Surprising Software Bid	I.B.M. has a huge distribution network, through which it sells everything from mainframe computers to business consulting services. The problem is that I.B.M. lacks exciting software that will keep its customers in tow or attract new ones, especially in the personal computer market where I.B.M. lags. Lotus Development Corporation cannot recreate I.B.M.'s distribution network, but it can create something even better, a computer network. A Lotus software product known as Notes allows computers, often within an organization, to share files, data and other electronic communication, whether those computers are in the same building or on opposite sides of the world. By tying computers together, Notes can be as vital to a business as the operating system that runs its stand-alone computers.
6/7/1995	A New Test Of Antitrust Hard Line	Which is the greater threat to competition: a $5 billion company that buys another that is pre-eminent in its field, or a $64 billion company that buys one with no competitor at all? In Federal antitrust circles these days, the answer depends largely on which company is the Microsoft Corporation and which is I.B.M. At a time when the Justice Department has made it clear that it wants to be an aggressive antitrust cop, the uninvited bid by I.B.M. to acquire the Lotus Development Corporation, announced on Monday, puts the Government under pressure to draw meaningful distinctions about perceived competitive threats to the technology marketplace.
6/6/1995	I.B.M.'s BIG MOVE: THE BIDDER; I.B.M. SEEKS TO BUY SOFTWARE MAKER IN $3.3 BILLION BID	Stunning other computer companies as well as its prey, I.B.M. made a surprise $3.3 billion bid yesterday to acquire the Lotus Development Corporation for what would be the largest amount ever paid for a computer software company. If the hostile takeover succeeds, Lotus could aid the International Business Machines Corporation's effort to regain momentum in the personal computer field, a market it helped create in the early 1980's with the I.B.M. PC but one in which it has subsequently stumbled.
6/5/1995	You Say 'Internet'; the Spell-Checker Says 'Interment'	It is a world blissfully ignorant of cyberspace, telecommuters, Pentiums and infotainment. It is a realm apparently so technologically indifferent that it concedes the existence of neither technophobes nor technophiles. This is no post-industrial commune we're talking about, but the vocabulary of the two leading word-processing programs: the Microsoft Corporation's Word and Novell Inc.'s Wordperfect. A test of the spell-checkers offered by these two high-tech companies shows an occasionally low-tech lexicon that includes none of the italicized words in the preceding paragraph.
5/29/1995	Most Wanted; An Internet Provider Becomes a Hot Stock	It was a big week for hot initial public offereings in high tech, with no fewer than five of them leaping as soon as public trading began. But the hottest of them all was Uunet Technologies, a company that provides access to the Internet, and is partly owned by Microsoft. It closed Friday at $27.50, 96 percent above the offering price of $14. The company has never made a dime, but hjopes to change that after Windows 95 is issued by Microsoft, using Uunet (pronounced you-you-net) to provide access to the Internet computer network.
5/29/1995	Bigger Means Better	"To the Editor: """"Microsoft Ducks"""" (editorial, May 24) calls it a """"resounding triumph"""" that Justice Department litigators forced the """"software giant"""" to back off from a merger with Intuit. While Asians, Europeans and others are forming alliances, with government support, to help successful companies compete in world markets, our country is moving in the opposite direction."
5/26/1995	Microsoft: Who Won	To the Editor: Your May 24 editorial on the failed merger between Microsoft and Intuit is only half correct. The decision is a victory for Microsoft's competitors; it will have little if any impact on consumers. Software prices are already ridiculously low, and are more than accessible to computer owners. Intuit's Quicken can be had for $49 and often less, and Microsoft's most powerful applications can be purchased for about $100.
5/24/1995	Microsoft Ducks	The same Justice Department that was accused a few months ago of administering a mere wrist slap to the Microsoft Corporation in an antitrust case has now come back to score a resounding triumph over the software giant in a different case. The Government's litigators, by simply filing suit, have forced Microsoft to back down from a proposed $2 billion purchase of rival Intuit Inc. that could have substantially reduced competition in the market for personal finance software. The unexpected cancellation of the deal should spark renewed and fiercer competition between Microsoft and Intuit, the frustrated suitors, and thus lead to better products at lower prices. Personal finance software is important in its own right and as a springboard into the emerging world of electronic banking and purchasing.
5/22/1995	And Now, a Scramble in Finance Software	The market for personal finance software is going to get very competitive very quickly now that the Microsoft Corporation has dropped its attempt to acquire Intuit Inc. in the face of Justice Department opposition. Intuit's Quicken program claims more than 80 percent of the personal finance software market, and without it Microsoft has little choice but to throw renewed energy behind the Microsoft Money program, which ranks third in the market, with a share of 4 percent. Indeed, Microsoft officials said on Saturday that they were nearly ready to release Version 4 of the Money program.
5/22/1995	Gates, the Pragmatist, Walked Away	Bill Gates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, seems to attract admiration and fear in equal measure. In the computer industry and in government circles, he has been called everything from a brilliant inventor-entrepreneur to a ruthless monopolist. Some see him as the Thomas Edison of the information age; others see John D. Rockefeller. One thing Mr. Gates, America's richest man, is not known for is walking away from a fight. Yet he chose to do precisely that with his surprise announcement Saturday that the Microsoft Corporation was abandoning its planned $2 billion purchase of Intuit Inc., because of the Justice Department's antitrust challenge to the deal and the prospect of long delays.
5/21/1995	MICROSOFT SCRAPS A SOFTWARE DEAL THAT U.S. OPPOSED	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it was abandoning its planned $2 billion acquisition of Intuit Inc., which would have been the largest deal ever in the software industry, because of a legal challenge from the Justice Department and the possibility of protracted litigation. Scuttling the deal with Intuit, whose Quicken software is by far the most popular personal-finance computer program, will significantly slow Microsoft's entry into the world of electronic commerce and could alter the choices consumers have among computerized financial and banking services in years to come.
5/17/1995	Microsoft and NBC in Multimedia Alliance	The Microsoft Corporation and NBC announced an alliance yesterday to produce an array of multimedia products and services. But the details were so fuzzy that some industry analysts said the announcement was the digital-age equivalent of agreeing to be friends. William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and Robert C. Wright, the president of NBC, said in a conference call with reporters that the companies would jointly develop CD-ROM's, interactive television services and products for Microsoft's new on-line service, the Microsoft Network.
5/16/1995	Three Named to Microsoft's Top Management	The Microsoft Corporation promoted three executives yesterday to its office of the president, a move that analysts viewed as a broadening of management control as the software developer moves into new businesses. At Microsoft, the office of the president is the top-management group that works directly with William H. Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, in charting the company's strategy. The office of the president, formerly a three-person forum, will now have five members.
5/15/1995	Microsoft Said To Be Losing A Top Official	Mike Maples, a 52-year-old executive vice president of the Microsoft Corporation and a member of the software maker's three-person office of the president, is expected to announce today that he plans to retire, people close to the company said yesterday. Along with Mr. Maples's plans to step down, these people said, Microsoft also intends to announce a reorganization of its top management structure, enlarging the office of the president. They did not say how many people would be added to the top tier of managers, but the members would come from the ranks of five senior vice presidents who now head business divisions and report to Mr. Maples.
5/7/1995	The World: Power Grab; Ground Rules For the Great	"NO less a social philosopher than Wilt Chamberlain, in the days when he literally stood head and shoulders above everyone else on the basketball court, put the matter succinctly: """"No man roots for Goliath."""" In business, as in sports, giants often attract not only resentment and envy, but they also find themselves accused of competing unfairly. And those crying foul often call for change in the rules. The designated Goliath of the technological world is the Microsoft Corporation, a 20-year-old company cofounded by a Harvard dropout named Bill Gates, who has become the richest man in America, both feared and admired."
5/4/1995	End Is Sought To Videodisk Format Rivalry	Hoping to put an end to a fierce format rivalry, a group of leading American computer companies has urged Japanese and European consumer electronics companies to develop a unified standard for the digital videodisk, a highly anticipated future product. The computer industry committee, composed of technical experts from Apple Computer, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Microsoft, did not endorse either the system proposed by the Toshiba Corporation or a rival system developed by Sony and Philips Electronics N.V. Each computer company will decide on its own which format, if any, to support.
5/1/1995	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: A Question of Trust; Oil, Phones, Software: Do the Same Rules Apply?	Seldom since the days of John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil trust has the power of one man's company transfixed so many people as Bill Gates and the Microsoft Corporation do now. Having grown from a start-up operation to the world's largest software company in about 15 years, Microsoft touches the lives of virtually everyone who uses a personal computer at work or at home. Its products, led by the MS-DOS operating system and its companion Windows, control the basic operations on most personal computers sold and -- even though they are often perceived as tedious and difficult to operate -- they play a role as transforming as that of the telephone.
4/29/1995	More Than One Challenge to Microsoft and Intuit	Even if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking the proposed $2 billion merger of the Microsoft Corporation and Intuit Inc., analysts said yesterday, there would probably not be any significant impact on the rapid development of electronic financial services. . In filing an antitrust suit in Federal District Court in San Francisco on Thursday, the Justice Department argued that the merger -- the largest in software history -- would stifle competition and lead to higher software prices, hurting consumers.
4/28/1995	Justice Department Views Microsoft From Both Sides	On Monday, Justice Department officials were in Federal court defending Microsoft against allegations of monopolistic practices. Today, Justice Department officials went to another Federal court to file suit against Microsoft, contending it would violate antitrust laws with a planned merger. That peculiar combination gave the Justice Department the appearance of having reversed itself with dizzying speed. But antitrust law is less a matter of broad philosophy than of individual cases, and the Justice Department argued today that there was no inconsistency in pursuing such apparently different outcomes in different cases.
4/28/1995	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a Federal appeals court hearing in an antitrust case involving the Microsoft Corporation misspelled the surname of the company's lead lawyer. He is Richard Urowsky. A picture caption in some editions with the article misidentified the man shown. He was Mr. Urowsky, not Joel Klein, a Justice Department lawyer.
4/28/1995	U.S. SUES TO BLOCK $2 BILLION MERGER MICROSOFT SEEKS	In a major setback for the Microsoft Corporation, the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit here today to block the company's planned $2 billion acquisition of Intuit Inc., maker of Quicken, the leading personal finance software program. The Justice Department opposes the merger -- which would be the largest ever in the software industry -- on the ground that it could lead to higher prices and fewer consumer choices in the market for personal computer software used for balancing checkbooks, tracking investments and other financial housekeeping tasks. Intuit's Quicken and a similar Microsoft program called Money together control more than 90 percent of the market.
4/26/1995	Microsoft to Sell Software With Computer Associates	Expanding an existing alliance, Computer Associates and the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that they would jointly market a software package combining their programs for corporate computer systems. Computer Associates said it had begun shipping a version of its Unicenter software program for Microsoft's Windows NT, a more advanced operating system than its popular Windows that is intended to run the computer networks of a company or institution. Windows NT is aimed at the so-called enterprise market, as opposed to desktop computing.
4/25/1995	Microsoft and Justice Department Defend Settlement Attempt	"The Microsoft Corporation and the Justice Department defended their attempt to settle antitrust charges before a Federal appeals court here today as a panel of three judges skeptically questioned the software giant and its opponents. In a lively session that produced no obvious winners or losers, lawyers for the Justice Department conceded that the agreement was not as tough on Microsoft as it could have been, but they insisted that the deal was within """"the reach of the public interest."
4/24/1995	Court Hearing For Microsoft Set for Today	The Microsoft Corporation is scheduled to return to a Federal courtroom here on Monday, once again trying to fend off critics who say that the software giant stifles competition. But this time the company will be in step with the same Federal prosecutors who investigated it. And as debate unfolds before a three-member panel of the Federal Court of Appeals, it will have very little to do with software or computers.
4/24/1995	The Executive Computer	"IT'S a time-honored tradition that helps customers and results in better software. It's a diabolical plot by powerful companies to lock out the competition and confuse consumers. It's """"vaporware,"""" the most misunderstood concept in the software industry. Generally, vaporware refers to a software product that a company announces long before it is delivered -- if it ever reaches the market at all. But it is a term whose precise definition is somewhat elusive. And it is among the topics at issue in the Microsoft Corporation case that the United States Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear today in Washington."
4/21/1995	INTUIT'S STOCK FALLS ON CONCERN ABOUT MICROSOFT DEAL	Shares of Intuit Inc. fell yesterday, as a report of possible moves by the Justice Department increased speculation that the proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Intuit by the Microsoft Corporation might fall through. While some analysts said they did not expect the Justice Department to oppose the acquisition, private antitrust lawyers said department officials were inclined to impose restrictions on what Microsoft could do with the Quicken personal finance software program of Intuit, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has its own personal finance software. In Nasdaq trading yesterday, shares of Intuit fell $1.25, to $76.25, and shares of Microsoft fell 87.5 cents, to $75.25. A report in an on-line newsletter, Interactive Week, said Justice Department officials were collecting evidence for a possible challenge to the acquisition.
4/20/1995	International Briefs; In Brief	The Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash., will set up two or three joint ventures in China in the next six months to develop and manufacture the software it sells there domestically, a company official said.
4/17/1995	First of Mac Clones To Be Offered Today	The Power Computing Corporation, a tiny start-up company led by one of the original copiers of the I.B.M. personal computer, is expected to introduce the first clones of the Apple Macintosh today. The arrival of copy-cat computers that run the Macintosh operating system are the core of Apple Computer Inc.'s new strategy to increase its stalled market share and slow sales of Intel-based PC's that use the Windows software of the Microsoft Corporation, which now outsell the Macintosh computers by an estimated 10 to 1.
4/14/1995	Microsoft Manages to Post Record Quarterly Earnings	Defying broad expectations of a lackluster performance, the Microsoft Corporation reported yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 55 percent, setting a company record. Analysts said Microsoft had cautioned them not to expect a high-growth quarter because the company lacked new products in the retail market. Others expected a slowdown because Microsoft's Office, its package of business programs, was a few months past the peak of its sales cycle -- and because corporations might be holding off on volume purchases pending the planned release later this year of Windows 95, the next version of Microsoft's personal computer operating system.
4/13/1995	Wang and Microsoft: Foes Turn Into Allies	Wang Laboratories and the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that they had settled a longstanding patent-infringement lawsuit and formed a broad technical, service and marketing alliance. Wang, once nearly given up for dead after being forced from the computer-hardware business, received a $90 million cash infusion and a major endorsement by Microsoft for its software products. Microsoft's investment represents about 10 percent of Wang's common stock.
4/11/1995	Come, Watson! The Game's Afoot!	YOU have a wonderful idea for a computer game. A private detective's partner is killed and ensuing events lead to a beautiful woman, a couple of villains and a search for a priceless statuette. It's the stuff dreams are made of, no doubt, but you are not a programmer. Now you do not have to be a programmer to create a game. It can be done with Klik and Play, a Microsoft Windows program from Maxis of Orinda, Calif., and dogged patience.
4/5/1995	A Legal High-Wire Artist Takes On Silicon Valley Giants	It is probably safe to say that Jim Manzi and Bill Gates, who seem to have little to agree on as the chief executives of Lotus Development and Microsoft, both wish they had never heard of Gary Reback. A lawyer with the Silicon Valley firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, Mr. Reback wrote a brief that was influential in the decision by Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin in February to reject the Justice Department's settlement of its antitrust case against Microsoft. Last month, Mr. Reback helped Borland International Inc. win a ruling in a copyright infringement case brought by Lotus, when a Federal appeals court panel overturned a lower court's ruling that could have required Borland to pay crippling damages.
4/4/1995	Corrections	Because of an editing error, the Digital Commerce column in Business Day yesterday, about alliances between technology companies and Hollywood, misstated the size of a recent investment in Dreamworks SKG by Paul Allen, a co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation. It was $500 million, not $500,000.
4/3/1995	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: Digital Commerce; Dreamworks' founders seem incapable of thinking ugly, which is the only way their venture will succeed.	A SPECIAL-EFFECTS Oscar should go to the reality-distortion field that surrounds the latest mad coupling of Hollywood and the technology elite. For those just beamed in from another galaxy, the new entertainment company controlled by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen -- Dreamworks SKG -- recently took a $500,000 investment from Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and a few days later announced Dreamworks Interactive, a joint venture with Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates.
3/27/1995	The Executive Computer	IN the personal computer industry's latest attempt to close the ease-of-use gap that separates most PC's from the Macintosh, a consortium led by the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation disclosed a plan last week to make plugging peripherals into the back of the computer as easy as plugging a lamp into an outlet. This latest salvo in the long battle over ease of use is called the universal serial bus, and while today it exists only on paper, like so many other industry promises, many people say this is one project that will work -- and catch on fast.
3/27/1995	Microsoft Sues Apple Computer	Microsoft filed a counterclaim on Friday in response to a suit by Apple Computer that accuses Intel and Microsoft of misappropriating technology vital to multimedia software. On Feb. 9, Apple added Microsoft and Intel to a lawsuit it had filed against the San Francisco Canyon Company. Apple has contended that without its permission, San Francisco Canyon had given Intel, the chip maker, and Microsoft, the software publisher, software that had originally been developed for Apple.
3/26/1995	VOICES: VIEWPOINT; It's Feast, Not Famine, At the Software Table	FOR the vast majority of people in the computer software industry, these are the best of times. The industry grew by a robust 11 percent last year, with sales topping $77 billion worldwide. That makes it the fastest-growing segment of the nation's service economy. That fact, however, has been lost in the shadows of Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin's recent rejection of Microsoft's settlement with the Justice Department concerning our licensing of operating system software to hardware manufacturers. This is unfortunate.
3/25/1995	FLAW IS POINTED OUT EARLY IN WINDOWS 95 SOFTWARE	"The Microsoft Corporation is sending out 450,000 flawed copies of Windows 95 to 450,000 users who have agreed to test what are known as """"beta,"""" or preliminary versions, of software, Infoworld magazine reported. Windows 95, the business version of Microsoft's Windows operating system for personal computers, is expected to be shipped in August. Microsoft's final test version of Windows 95 contains a design flaw that limits its use for business, the magazine reported in its March 27 issue. Computers running the system and multiple application programs together will sometimes freeze. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., concedes that the latest Windows 95 test version has a design flaw, and says it has provided software to fix it, the magazine said. However, Infoworld's editor, Nicholas Petreley, who said he had tried both the new program and the remedy, contended that the remedy could also cause problems. The purpose of beta tests is to find problems in software before it is sold commercially. NO MORE"
3/23/1995	Dreamworks and Microsoft in Multimedia Venture	Dreamworks SKG and the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that they would form a software company to produce interactive and multimedia entertainment products. Separately, William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft, said his company would become a minority investor in Dreamworks; he did not disclose the amount of the investment. On Sunday, Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, agreed to make an equity investment of $500 million in Dreamworks, which is raising a total of $900 million from outside investors.
3/22/1995	Market Place; The Microsoft-Intuit deal tests the nerves of arbitragers.	WILL Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, succeed in taking over Intuit, the leading purveyor of personal finance software? The uncertainty surrounding the deal, which is being reviewed by the Justice Department's antitrust division, has created headaches for some of Wall Street's sharpest investors. In recent days, the difference, or spread, between the value of Microsoft's offer and Intuit's share price has climbed as high as $22, one of the widest gaps in a major deal in recent memory.
3/20/1995	Journalists Uneasy About Microsoft News Service	Executives at the Microsoft Corporation have rejected assertions that the company plans to begin competing directly with news organizations this summer when it begins its Microsoft Network on-line service. But ambitious electronic news-publishing services being prepared by software makers like Microsoft and the Oracle Corporation, by telephone companies like AT&T and by other technology companies have renewed concerns that as news gathering moves into the information era, editorial decisions may increasingly be made by business executives who are not journalists.
3/20/1995	Investor to Put $500 Million In New Studio	"Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, has agreed to invest about $500 million to acquire 18.3 percent of Dreamworks SKG, the entertainment company that is controlled by David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. Mr. Allen's investment puts a value on the fledgling company of $2.7 billion. """"It is very impressive because it is a great deal of money for a modest stake,"""" said David Londoner, who follows entertainment for Wertheim Schroder & Company."
3/17/1995	MICROSOFT SAYS WINDOWS 95 WILL BE OUT BY AUGUST	"Officials of the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that the Windows 95 operating system would be available in the United States by August. """"We're on schedule,"""" Mike Conte, group manager of the Microsoft personal systems division, said yesterday. On Wednesday the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates, said in Bonn that Windows 95 would be """"on the market in the September time frame."""" Mr. Conte said Mr. Gates was referring to the schedule for Europe. He said Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., usually released the international versions of its operating systems 30 days after the release in the United States. Windows 95 is the latest version of the Windows operating system, which controls the fundamental functions of more than 60 million personal computers worldwide."
3/16/1995	MICROSOFT DELAYS INTRODUCTION OF WINDOWS 95 AGAIN	"The chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation, William H. Gates, said the company planned to have the newest version of its Windows operating system software, Windows 95, on the market by September -- a month later than previously estimated. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash, had already postponed the introduction of the long-awaited product three times. Shipment of the software was originally supposed to begin in December. """"Our goal is to continue to update Windows -- every couple of years we'll have a major update,"""" Mr. Gates told an audience of more than 200 computer experts and government officials in Bonn."
3/8/1995	Microsoft and U.S. Seek to Upset Judge's Decision	Teaming up with the Justice Department, its former adversary, the Microsoft Corporation filed an unusually personal brief today asking a Federal appeals court to overturn a judge's decision that dismissed the company's attempt to settle antitrust charges out of court. Lawyers for Microsoft also urged that the judge, Stanley Sporkin, be disqualified from the case, contending he had relied on a popular book about Microsoft for much of his information.
3/6/1995	Why Microsoft and Justice Dept. Settled	"To the Editor: """"Microsoft Back in the Dock"""" (editorial, Feb. 20) reflects an apparent misunderstanding of the antitrust investigation of Microsoft. The phrase """"in the dock"""" refers to a holding area in British courts for people accused of criminal conduct. This is a civil, not criminal case."
3/1/1995	Netscape Knows Fame And Aspires to Fortune	"It would seem to be a bonanza for the Netscape Communications Corporation. Only a few months after releasing its first software, the company seems to be the runaway leader in a field with growth rates not seen since the early, heady days of the personal computer business. The frenzy involves """"browser"""" software -- programs that enable Internet users to navigate the phenomenally popular multimedia service known as the World Wide Web. And although other browsers are available, Netscape's Navigator software has emerged as many people's browser of choice."
2/28/1995	Can You Really Eat All You Can Eat?	"THE computer industry calls them """"integrated application suites,"""" but a better name might be """"smorgasware."""" Install one of these all-in-one behemoths, and you may suddenly feel as overwhelmed as if you had stepped into the world's largest all-you-can eatery. Thousands of options as mundane as hot dogs and as sophisticated as foie gras suddenly assail you, along with the possibility of inventing your own dishes, perhaps hot dogs on a bed of foie gras. Life, you suddenly realize, is too short. And then, in the distance, you spy choices as obscure as the Far Eastern delicacy unhatched chicks in their shells, which will undoubtedly appeal to somebody somewhere, but probably never to you."
2/26/1995	Profile; A Physicist Is Propelling Microsoft Into Cyberspace	Russ Siegelman's passion is chess, but he hasn't had time to play it lately. Instead, he is pondering the Microsoft Corporation's next big move -- into cyberspace. An aggressive player, Mr. Siegelman is putting different pieces into play, moving toward what he hopes will be checkmate: making the Microsoft Network king of the on-line universe.
2/26/1995	Ideas & Trends; Technology Monopolies Are Big, but Often Brittle	"Remember the """"I.B.M.-compatible"""" computer? Only 10 years ago, I.B.M.'s power was so great that it singlehandedly decreed the technical standards for most personal computers. But today, that phrase is quaintly out of date. The once-mighty Big Blue, plagued by billions of dollars in losses over the last several years, no longer sets the standards and is now merely one of many rivals in the market. Today, however, a new company has transfixed the country, and the Federal Government, with its seemingly awesome power. Microsoft Corporation, started from scratch in 1975, arguably generates even more fear and loathing in some quarters of the industry than I.B.M. ever did. Its two core products -- MS-DOS and Windows -- provide the basic operating instructions for about 80 percent of all personal computers. It has expanded ferociously into almost every other corner of the software industry. Its stock-market value rivals that of General Motors, and its chairman, Bill Gates, has a net worth of more than $6 billion. Rivals accuse it of bullying tactics, arrogance and dirty tricks."
2/21/1995	A Machine That Bridges 2 Worlds	"FOR the young Macintosh enthusiast, it was agony. He had access to a Mac Quadra computer with a CD-ROM drive, but a relative had given him two tantalizing Windows CD-ROM programs, """"Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time"""" and """"Wing Commander III."""" Spending $2,000 or more for a Windows multimedia computer just to run the games was out of the question, given the pittance he received each week for his allowance. And Dad's Windows machine had been off limits ever since the young man replaced all of its boring system sounds with an assortment of belches, sneezes, screams and other rude noises."
2/21/1995	Judge in the Microsoft Case Is Willing to Test the Limits	"There has been a recurring scene in the long career of Stanley Sporkin, in which somebody very powerful is sputtering in outraged disbelief at what Mr. Sporkin has done. Over the years the cast of characters has varied from giant corporations like Lockheed and Exxon to powerful Government actors like the White House and State Department. Their protests generally come down to this: """"Now see here! This is not the way things are done! You don't understand! You simply cannot do this!"
2/20/1995	Microsoft Back in the Dock	Judge Stanley Sporkin has every right to feel frustrated. After four years of Federal investigation, the Justice Department and the Microsoft Corporation reached an antitrust settlement designed to end unfair, anticompetitive practices by the software giant. But neither Judge Sporkin nor any other outsider has the foggiest idea whether the agreement is adequate or a mere wrist slap when stronger measures are needed. We still don't know whether Microsoft for the most part competes fairly, in which case it is a crown jewel of the American economy, just the sort of technological and business success this nation badly needs to compete in world markets in the coming information age. Or is Microsoft a predator that uses its market dominance to freeze out the superior products of competitors while insuring success for clunkier products of its own?
2/19/1995	February 12-18: Microsoft; An Antitrust Settlement With a Glitch	"Seven months after Federal antitrust officials declared they had reined in the mighty Microsoft Corporation, they saw their work rebuffed by a hard-nosed judge. Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin refused to approve a consent decree between the Government and Microsoft, calling the deal """"too little, too late."
2/17/1995	U.S. Appeals Ruling by Judge on Microsoft	"The Justice Department today appealed a Federal judge's decision on Tuesday to strike down its antitrust settlement with the Microsoft Corporation, saying that the judge was """"squarely wrong"""" and had overstepped his authority. Within a few hours, Microsoft announced that it was joining the Justice Department appeal, a move that now officially places the former adversaries on the same team."
2/16/1995	Microsoft Dilemma for Justice Dept.	United States Judge Stanley Sporkin could not believe what he was hearing, so he looked down once again at the Justice Department's top antitrust official and repeated the question: What if he could persuade Microsoft Corporation, which was trying to settle charges of unfair competition, to accept a few extra restrictions beyond those the Government had already negotiated?
2/16/1995	Merger Is Seen As Threatened	Intuit Inc. shares fell as much as 8 percent yesterday after a Federal judge rejected the Microsoft Corporation's proposed antitrust settlement with the Justice Department, raising the possibility that the companies' pending merger might be scrapped. United States District Judge Stanley Sporkin's decision to reject the consent decree raises questions about the Justice Department's review of Microsoft's proposed $1.5 billion acquisition of Intuit, a maker of the popular Quicken financial software.
2/15/1995	Judge Rejects U.S. Antitrust Pact With Microsoft	In a decision that throws the Federal Government's biggest antitrust case into turmoil, a Federal judge here rejected today the Justice Department's agreement to settle allegations that the Microsoft Corporation, the world's biggest software company, unfairly competed with its rivals. The decision is a considerable embarrassment for the Justice Department, which last July described its settlement as a victory that would rein in one of the most feared companies in the computer industry and which now must rebut criticism that the accord was too tame.
2/10/1995	Intel and Microsoft Added to Apple Lawsuit	Apple Computer has expanded a lawsuit against a small software company by adding Microsoft and Intel to the complaint, contending that the two companies have illegally duplicated and distributed Apple's software. The suit for theft of intellectual property and breach of contract was originally filed on Dec. 6 against the San Francisco Canyon Company, a small software company working for Apple to develop software to make features of an Apple operating system component known as Quicktime available for Intel-compatible computers.
2/9/1995	The point-and-click universe is expanding into movies, television and marketing campaigns.	DIALOGUE boxes. Pull-down menus. Tool bars. Windows. Icons. Button strips. Arrows. Screen savers. These are the visual signatures of the mouse-controlled computer screen, and they are everywhere these days -- in television and print advertisements, in feature films and in television dramas and sitcoms.
2/9/1995	New System for Linking Office Equipment Is in the Works	I.B.M. and many Japanese makers of office equipment are discussing the creation of a new standard for linking personal computers with faxes, copiers, telephones and other electronic devices, industry officials said today. The effort represents an attempt by the International Business Machines Corporation to compete with a plan announced by Microsoft in 1993 to tie office machines together using its Microsoft At Work software. The Microsoft system, which many Japanese companies had said they would support, has experienced some development problems, according to industry officials here.
2/5/1995	Technology; Internet Server Takes a Big Step	IF John Sidgmore was certain of anything after 20-some years in the computer networking business, it was that success in the Internet game would require a series of alliances and marketing deals. Never did he imagine it might come in a single stroke of the pen. But last month, when Mr. Sidgmore's tiny company, UUNet Technologies Inc., signed a deal with the mighty Microsoft Corporation, UUNet suddenly seemed to hold one of the top spots in the burgeoning Internet market.
1/24/1995	Making It Easier to Enter the Web	NOT too long ago, the Internet was similar to a wonderful book bazaar or library, without any system for organization, where many interesting works could be found if one had the patience to sift through the random stacks. Woe to the reader who dug into the mounds of books in search of one particular tome. In the last few years the Internet has expanded at a phenomenal rate, and it now dwarfs any library in the physical world. The equivalent of the Library of Congress goes whizzing through the global computer network every few seconds. Trying to find that one particular piece of information on the Internet can be a frustrating experience, especially for newcomers.
1/23/1995	Sony and Microsoft Set Video-on-Demand Pact	"In a marriage of Japanese hardware and American software, the Sony Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation have agreed to work together to develop systems for """"video on demand"""" and other applications of high capacity communications networks, a Microsoft spokeswoman said today. The two companies will work together on both home terminals, like set-top boxes, and on central computer systems that would deliver video and audio programs over the cable or telephone network in response to requests from particular consumers. The companies will also explore the development of future consumer electronics products."
1/21/1995	Microsoft Settlement Challenged	"Declaring that """"I will not be played for a fool,"""" a Federal judge grilled the Justice Department's top antitrust lawyer today and made it clear he had grave doubts about the department's antitrust settlement with the Microsoft Corporation. In an often tense hearing that lasted nearly eight hours, Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin displayed industry documents suggesting that Microsoft intentionally deceived its rivals about its plans to introduce a new product and demanded to know why the Justice Department had not addressed that issue and others in the proposed settlement."
1/20/1995	From Mac Users, Fury at Microsoft	Can great big software companies write truly great computer programs? The question is being raised by users of Apple Macintosh computers, who are widely reviling and rejecting the newest version by the Microsoft Corporation of its word processing program, Word, for use on the Macintosh. Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, dominates the market for Macintosh software, including a 65 percent share of Macintosh word processing programs.
1/19/1995	MICROSOFT CORP. (MSFT,Q)	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 29 percent -- more than analysts had predicted -- on better-than-expected sales of general business programs. Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, said net income rose to $373 million, or 60 cents a share, from $289 million, or 48 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier.
1/17/1995	Bob: Your New Best Friend's Personality Quirks	"MAKING computers easier to use is easier said than done. For years the Microsoft Corporation has been designing convoluted user interfaces and declaring them """"easy."""" The simple command for saving one's work in early Microsoft programs was the Escape key followed by the letters T and S for Transfer, Save. In """"The Underground Guide to Word for Windows,"""" the author, Woody Leonhard, writes, """"If you think it's easy, you haven't been trying."""" Even Microsoft now grants that using Windows itself is not nearly as simple as its ads once proclaimed. Now that Microsoft has announced Bob, the resulting barrage of publicity leads me to break my habit of waiting for the final version before testing the product and to proceed with a close look at what works and what doesn't. (Note well: Bob will not be on the shelves before the end of March.)"
1/14/1995	U.S. Judge May Reconsider Settlement With Microsoft	The judge overseeing the Microsoft Corporation's long antitrust wrangle with the Justice Department agreed here today to consider taking more testimony opposing the Government's settlement agreement with the software giant. In an unusual move, United States District Judge Stanley Sporkin issued an order indicating that he would hear arguments from competitors who still hope to force changes in the antitrust settlement Microsoft reached last July.
1/13/1995	Microsoft's Next Move Is On Line	The Microsoft Corporation, in a move certain to accelerate the already dizzying growth of the Internet and on-line information services, disclosed plans yesterday to become one of the world's largest commercial providers of access to the global Internet computer network. In remarks scheduled to be delivered last night at a software industry conference in Seattle, William H. Gates, chairman and chief executive of the Redmond, Wash., software company, outlined plans to offer full access to the global computer network through the Microsoft Network on-line information service it plans to start up later this year. Until yesterday, Microsoft had not disclosed the extent to which it would link its network to the Internet.
1/12/1995	Houses by Gates: Virtual and Real; Welcome to Bob's Place, Where No Icon's a Stranger	THE first image on the computer screen is a bright brass knocker on a red door.  Click. A living room appears, a fire blazing happily in the hearth. Outside the picture windows, snow-capped mountains rise. In the corner is a grandfather clock; on the carpet, a tawny cat. On the coffee table are a Rolodex file, a checkbook and a home maintenance guide. Click. The wall calendar tells you today's the day to clean the chimney. Click. The maintenance guide tells you how. It's cold outside. Click. Swap the mountains for a palm-lined beach.
1/12/1995	MOGUL HOMES	In 1895, when locomotives drove the American economy, a railroad scion named George Washington Vanderbilt built the ultimate bachelor pad: a 175,000-square-foot chateau with 225 rooms. It remains the largest home in the United States. A century later, microchips rule, and Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, and his wife are settling for just 34,000 square feet, most of it underground. The number of rooms? Who knows? Their architects aren't talking. Given inflation (and considering the wall-to-wall high-tech gadgetry that is being installed), the Gates house will probably be up to the mogul standard set by Biltmore -- costing around $30 million. So if you ever strike it rich, here's a primer to kingpin style. MITCHELL OWENS
1/12/1995	Houses by Gates: Virtual and Real; It Takes Time To Build Xanadu	THE garage is tunneled into the hillside, with room enough to hold 20 cars, its roof covered by sod from the Cascade Range and surrounded by a fresh-planted forest of Northwest alders. Batman would blush. At the bottom of the slope is an estuary, man-made, fed by a small stream into which salmon will swim, procreate and die every fall, according to plan. Nature, not the building code, now governs that part.
1/12/1995	Embattled Borland Chief Steps Down	"A self-described """"barbarian"""" of the software industry has fallen on his sword, a victim of both his own missteps and the increasingly brutal market for personal computer business software. Borland International Inc. said today that Philippe Kahn would step down as president and chief executive of the company he founded in 1983 and built into the third-largest publisher of desktop software before it began foundering several years ago. While many of Borland's problems are unique to the company, its rapid unraveling indicates how difficult it can be for any software company to compete directly these days with the industry leader, the Microsoft Corporation."
1/5/1995	Microsoft Prepares 'Bob,' A Guide for PC Novices	The Microsoft Corporation plans to introduce a software package this week that is intended to make personal computers easier for novices to use, an important element of the company's ambitious campaign to dominate the fast-growing market for home computer software. The new program, called Bob, features cartoon-like characters that give spoken instructions to users of Microsoft's Windows program, rather than having them choose from lists of commands or type instructions. This new approach allows people to interact with computers in a way the company says is more more natural than current methods.
1/3/1995	Microsoft's Rivals Are Hearing Louder Footsteps	This may not be the year that the Microsoft Corporation finally takes over the world, but the world's biggest independent software company is hoping to consolidate its hold over large chunks of the personal computer software industry. Already, the company has made a trademark of the new year by naming the latest version of its industry-dominant operating system Windows 95. And even though Microsoft recently announced that shipments of the new Windows may be delayed until August, in the battle for what marketers call mind share, the product has already won.
1/1/1995	The Executive Computer; When, Oh When, Will Computers Behave Like People?	"ELEVEN years ago, Apple Computer Inc. said it would make personal computers easy to use and came close with the Macintosh. A few years later, the Microsoft Corporation made a similar promise with Windows and then gave us, well, Windows. In 1993 I.B.M. talked about improving the PC experience, and then spelled out a strategy called """"natural computing,"""" a label the company does not appear to have used since."
12/31/1994	And the Spoof Begat a News Release, and Another	"In the beginning, there was the spoof, and the spoof was good. """"Microsoft Bids to Acquire Catholic Church,"""" read the headline of an authentic-looking Associated Press news wire story that quickly became one of the most widely circulated practical jokes yet in cyberspace."
12/30/1994	3 Campaigns Set For Holiday Release	"Three large advertisers are introducing big campaigns during the long holiday weekend. The International Business Machines Corporation will introduce its first worldwide brand campaign, which is being created by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York. Three television commercials, scheduled to begin on Sunday in the United States, carry the theme, """"Solutions for a small planet."
12/25/1994	The Executive Computer; In Marketing Wars, Apple Holds Its Fire	IF there was ever any question which was the kinder, gentler computer company -- Apple Computer or I.B.M. -- their respective handlings of the recent missteps at Intel and Microsoft should set aside all doubt. I.B.M. played pit bull, Apple pussycat. It doesn't necessarily mean that the people at Apple are fundamentally nicer -- just that they have their own good reasons for diplomacy.
12/22/1994	Microsoft Venture With Cable Giant	Tele-Communications Inc. said yesterday that it would invest $125 million for a 20 percent stake in the Microsoft Corporation's planned on-line service. The Microsoft network will be a service offered as an option in Windows 95 -- the next version of the Windows operating system. The new venture is expected go head-to-head with the leading on-line services: Compuserve, Prodigy Services and America Online.
12/21/1994	Another Delay at Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation may yet rue the day it decided to call its new operating system Windows 95. Microsoft said today that the software -- it is the much-anticipated successor to Windows 3.1, the most successful computer operating system yet -- may not be available until August, the third delay for a product that was originally supposed to be shipped this month.
12/18/1994	As Intel Offends Customers, Will Apple Benefit?	CALL it the case of the market that didn't react. As in a famous Sherlock Holmes mystery, the most important clue about Intel's status as a Wall Street darling was the fact the stock barely budged in the days after it was disclosed -- by a customer and not by Intel -- that its fanciest computer chip had problems with long division. The complacency about Intel reflects the Wall Street consensus that the personal computer boom will continue for many years and that the winners are and always will be Intel and Microsoft, which got rich by dominating important aspects of the I.B.M. compatible personal computer market. So even as the jokes began circulating about Pentium chips, including a report that its new chip would be called the Repentium, shareholders did not sell. Even I.B.M.'s conclusion that Pentium problems were worse than admitted did little to harm Intel's share price.
12/14/1994	Tele-Communications May Be Near On-Line Deal	Tele-Communications Inc. is close to acquiring a stake in the new Microsoft Network on-line computer service, according to an executive familiar with the transaction. The possible terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the executive said Tele-Communications was expected to buy about 20 percent of the equity of the on-line service from the Microsoft Corporation. A spokesman for Tele-Communications was traveling and could not be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for Microsoft declined to comment.
12/12/1994	Apple Lawsuit May Renew Legal Battle With Microsoft	Apple Computer Inc. has filed suit against a small San Francisco software developer in a case that may reignite a legal quarrel between Apple and the mighty Microsoft Corporation, its principal competitor in operating software. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., filed the complaint Dec. 6 in Federal District Court in San Jose, accusing a small Apple contractor, the San Francisco Canyon Company, of theft of intellectual property and breach of contract.
12/5/1994	No Studio Venture for Gates	"William H. Gates 3d, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, will not invest in a new Hollywood studio headed by Steven Spielberg, a spokeswoman for Microsoft said on Friday. Mr. Gates and other Microsoft executives met studio officials to discuss """"content,"""" or forms of entertainment, the spokeswoman, Pam Edstrom, said."
12/1/1994	From Apple's Chairman, Potshots at the PC Vision	Whoa, there, wide-eyed computer industry executives. Michael H. Spindler, Apple Computer's chairman, has some words of caution: You have too much vision.
12/1/1994	A Challenge to Microsoft in Interactive TV	Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said today that it had formed a subsidiary, Power TV, that would take on the Microsoft Corporation in developing the operating system software for interactive television. The Oracle Corporation and Sybase Inc., both data base software companies with multimedia projects under development, and Scala Inc., a producer of tools for the creation of multimedia titles, said they had begun to create versions of their programs to run with the Power TV operating system. That system will be used in cable television, telephone and satellite systems to process the colors, video, audio and data that will be essential elements of future multimedia applications.
11/23/1994	More Scrutiny of a Microsoft Merger	"The Microsoft Corporation and Intuit Inc. said today that they had received a second request from the Justice Department for information on their proposed merger. Both said the request had been anticipated and that they were cooperating with the Government. """"We were by no means surprised to get a second request,"""" said William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, adding that second requests were not uncommon in mergers of companies with overlapping products."
11/22/1994	Screen Savers As Art, or Vice Versa	WILLIAM H. GATES 3d, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, wants to share his art collection with you, in your home; not the Leonardo da Vinci notebook he bought this month for $30.8 million, but 48 Impressionist and post-Impressionists for less than $25. With Impressionists Collection, you can browse through the works of Cezanne, Monet, van Gogh and others, which look more like stained glass than canvas, or use them as screen savers. A Pissarro screen saver for Windows may seem a bit much, but it surely looks good. You almost hate to touch a key or move the mouse and make it disappear.
11/20/1994	The Executive Computer; Getting On-Line -- the Microsoft Way	AT the Comdex computer show last week in Las Vegas, the Microsoft Corporation gave the first public demonstration of its planned on-line service, which is to debut next year. And in typical fashion, Microsoft immediately set out to rewrite the rules of a game it hasn't even started to play. Called the Microsoft Network, it resembles other on-line services like America Online, Prodigy and Compuserve. Users will be able to send electronic messages, get technical support they can no longer get over the phone, look up words in far-away data bases and yak it up with strangers. Or shop for socks. Or exchange mail with the White House, and read about Socks (the First Cat).
11/20/1994	Sound Bytes; He's Making a Clean Break	AFTER 26 years of selling soap, Bob Herbold is looking for a clean start in software. Mr. Herbold, who had a career of progressively more influential executive roles at Procter & Gamble, surprised the consumer products industry two weeks ago when he announced he was leaving to join Microsoft. Last week, Mr. Herbold began his new job as the third member of Microsoft's office of the president and the company's new chief operating officer. At P.& G., based in Cincinnati, Mr. Herbold spent the last four years as a senior vice president for management systems, market research and advertising, overseeing all technology acquisitions.
11/15/1994	Sybase To Acquire Powersoft	Sybase Inc., a leader in software for managing corporate data bases, said today that it planned to acquire the Powersoft Corporation in a stock swap valued at more than $940 million. The deal, which would create the world's seventh-largest software company, would also be the industry's second-largest acquisition to date. Only the Microsoft Corporation's recently announced purchase of the personal-finance software company Intuit Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.5 billion would be larger.
11/14/1994	Microsoft Seen Disclosing On-Line Network Plan	The Microsoft Corporation, seeking to extend its domination beyond the software industry into the realm of interactive services, is expected to outline its plans today for an ambitious on-line information service called the Microsoft Network. Analysts say the network, which has been known by its code name, Marvel, could become a leader in the $13 billion on-line services industry almost as soon as it goes on line in the middle of next year.
11/12/1994	Leonardo Notebook Sells for $30.8 Million	A rare Leonardo da Vinci notebook containing more than 300 illustrations and scientific writings by the artist was sold for $30.8 million at Christie's yesterday. The price set a record for a manuscript sold at auction. Christie's would not identify the buyer, who bid by telephone, but a spokeswoman for William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, confirmed that he was the buyer.
11/11/1994	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Microsoft takes a user-friendly approach to selling its image in a new global campaign.	"MICROSOFT'S first worldwide image campaign is so extensive, so expansive and so expensive, maybe the company ought to rename itself Macrosoft. In broadcast, print and outdoor advertising by Wieden & Kennedy that begins next week, the Microsoft Corporation asks, """"Where do you want to go today?"""" Of the more than $100 million that the software giant has budgeted through July for the campaign -- which takes a winsome, humanistic approach to demystifying technology -- $25 million will be spent during the coming holiday shopping season."
11/10/1994	America Online Buys 2 Internet Companies	America Online Inc., facing a challenge from the Microsoft Corporation in the market for on-line computer services, said yesterday that it had acquired two small Internet service companies for a total of more than $34 million in stock. The companies acquired by America Online, Navisoft Inc. and Booklink Technologies Inc., would become the core of America Online's recently formed Internet Services Company. The companies, which are start-ups that have generated no revenue to date, make software that allow businesses and consumers to more easily use the Internet, especially the rapidly growing area known as the World Wide Web.
11/9/1994	Microsoft and Visa in Software Deal	Staking another claim in the emerging market for electronic commerce, the Microsoft Corporation said today that it had entered an agreement with Visa International to provide technology for secure electronic bank-card transactions across public and private computer networks. The deal comes less than a month after Microsoft agreed to acquire Intuit Inc., the leading producer of personal finance software, in a stock swap valued at about $1.5 billion.
11/9/1994	P.&G. Official Joins Microsoft	William H. Gates turned to an expert in computers and consumer-products marketing today to fill a longstanding opening in the top management ranks of the Microsoft Corporation. The company, based in Redmond, Wash., announced that it had appointed Robert J. Herbold, a senior vice president at the Procter & Gamble Company, as its executive vice president and chief operating officer.
11/7/1994	Maps and Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation has acquired the right to incorporate geographic-analysis tools developed by the Mapinfo Corporation into Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet program, the companies said in a statement released over the weekend. Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., did not announce a schedule for marketing the technology. Mapinfo, of Troy, N.Y., and Strategic Mapping Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., are the leaders in the desktop-mapping market. In August the Lotus Development Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., included Strategic Mapping's technology in the newest version of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, the main rival to Excel.
11/4/1994	After 3 Years, a PC Alliance Is Ready to Fight	Consolidating a three-year-old alliance that had seemed to be faltering, Apple Computer, I.B.M. and Motorola will announce on Monday a new personal computer design with the backing of several other big computer makers. The alliance is considered by many in the industry to be the companies' last best hope of breaking the domination of the PC market by machines using chips from the Intel Corporation and software from the Microsoft Corporation.
11/2/1994	Microsoft Organizes Its Interactive TV Team	While ambitious interactive television trials around the country are suffering delays, the Microsoft Corporation plans to announce eight new partners today in its pursuit of a strategy for deploying a set of interactive software technologies that extend from the local cable operator's offices to the consumer's living room, company executives said. Microsoft's new partners are the Hewlett Packard Company, the network operators U S West Inc., the Telstra Corporation in Australia and Deutsche Telekom, the world's largest cable company, and systems integration companies including NTT Data, Ing. C. Olivetti & Company, Anderson Consulting and Alcatel Cable. Hewlett Packard officials said yesterday that they would announce today a plan to make set-top boxes compatible with Microsoft's interactive television software.
10/31/1994	Two PC Pioneers Discussing a Rapprochement	"A """"grand rapprochement"""" between two of the personal computer industry's most visible and volatile pioneers, Steven P. Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., and William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, might be at hand. People familiar with the discussions say Mr. Jobs's faltering Next Inc. has quietly been negotiating with Microsoft for financing of Next's software development. A deal for Next to create a version of its highly regarded software for Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems was close to being announced this week, people familiar with the talks said, but snags delayed any immediate agreement. The discussions are continuing."
10/29/1994	SHAREHOLDERS GIVE PERMISSION ON STOCK OFFER	"The shareholders of the Microsoft Corporation voted yesterday to give the company permission to issue as many as 100 million shares of preferred stock. The move gives Microsoft the ability to raise money for future acquisitions or other transactions, company officials said. """"We don't have any specific intention to use it on any acquisition,"""" said Greg Maffei, treasurer for the company. """"It just provides us with flexibility."""" The measure was approved at Microsoft's annual meeting in Bellevue, Wash. Microsoft, the world's largest computer software maker, has no preferred stock now. Its common shares closed at $62.125, up 25 cents, in Nasdaq trading. The stock touched a record high of $62.375 earlier in the session."
10/26/1994	Novell in Antitrust Review	The Justice Department has requested records from Novell Inc. as part of an antitrust review of the proposed merger of the Microsoft Corporation and Intuit Inc., the producer of the Quicken personal finance software. Novell, based in Provo, Utah, said yesterday that it was complying with a demand for information about its plans to market personal finance and tax preparation software in competition with the Microsoft-Intuit combination.
10/20/1994	MICROSOFT CORP. (MSFT,NNM)	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that its fiscal first-quarter earnings rose more than 32 percent on strong sales of its Windows operating system and Office package of business programs. The world's largest maker of personal computer software said its net income totaled $316 million, or 51 cents a share, exceeding Wall Street's estimates by about 2 cents. Sales rose nearly 27 percent, to almost $1.25 billion.
10/19/1994	Market Place; Apple may defy the doomsayers, even in the long run.	IS Apple Computer for sale? Despite a gangbuster quarter that suggests the company's Power Macintosh family of personal computers is taking off, conventional wisdom suggests that Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., will soon wilt before the inevitable onslaught of a yet-to-be-shipped and untested Microsoft operating system, Windows 95.
10/19/1994	Banks Going Interactive to Fend Off New Rivals	Forget about learning to play interactive television game shows. Postpone plans to visit the Library of Congress on line. The first big consumer business on the information highway is shaping up as a set of financial household chores: balancing the checkbook, paying bills, saving for retirement. Banks spent millions to develop and offer their services on personal computers a decade ago, but no one was interested. Now, with the number of home computers in the United States at 30 million and growing, consumers have increasingly diverse options for checking their balances, moving money, paying bills and opening new accounts from personal computers and new computerized telephones. Several hundred thousand households now do a substantial amount of their money management electronically from home.
10/16/1994	The Executive Computer; Microsoft May Make Quicken the Home Banking Standard	ONE of the software industry's best David and Goliath stories came to an unexpected close last week when Goliath dropped his weapons and picked up his checkbook. In a stock swap worth a staggering $1.5 billion, the Microsoft Corporation agreed to acquire Intuit Inc., producer of the much-loved personal finance program, Quicken. With about 6 million active users of Quicken against 500,000 users of Microsoft's competing program, Money, Intuit has shown like no other company -- with the possible exception of Novell Inc. -- that it is possible to take on the Redmond giant and win.
10/14/1994	Microsoft in $1.5 Billion Deal to Acquire Intuit	The Microsoft Corporation, in the software industry's largest acquisition ever, agreed today to acquire Intuit Inc., the producer of the leading personal finance program, Quicken, in a stock swap valued at about $1.5 billion. For Microsoft, the world's largest software company, the ownership of Quicken would put the company in a position to dominate the emerging market for writing checks, paying bills and shopping electronically from home. Moreover, the acquisition highlights that Microsoft will expand its dominance through acquisition when its ability to do so with its own products fails.
10/13/1994	Rumor of Microsoft Interest Helps Push Up Intuit Shares	Shares of the software company Intuit Inc. rose for the second consecutive day today, at least in part on a published rumor that the company might be acquired by the Microsoft Corporation. Both companies declined to comment.
10/10/1994	Apple and I.B.M. Are Seen Close to PC Accord	Executives of Apple Computer and I.B.M. are close to agreeing on a common standard that would make the computers each company produces compatible with one another, industry executives familiar with the discussions said yesterday. For consumers, such a standard would mean they could buy a single machine that, without any modifications, would run software using several different operating systems: OS/2, which is the operating system that I.B.M. promotes; Apple's Macintosh and the Windows NT program made by the Microsoft Corporation.
9/28/1994	MICROSOFT ACQUIRES ALTAMIRA SOFTWARE IN STOCK DEAL	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software producer, said yesterday that it had acquired the Altamira Software Corporation for an undisclosed amount of stock. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said Altamira's image composition technology and management team would strengthen its offerings for digital graphics creation products, which are used to produce multimedia documents. Altamira is based in Mill Valley, Calif.
9/27/1994	Video Deals For Baby Bells	The Southwestern Bell Corporation said today that the Microsoft Corporation would provide software applications for its video and interactive television test-market project in a Dallas suburb. Separately, U S West introduced Gotv, its second programming venture for interactive television.
9/27/1994	Odd Keyboards May Help You Type; On the Other Hand, They May Not	"DO NOT REMOVE THIS TAG!"""" advises a sticker on the cord. A bigger sticker bears a bigger orange """"WARNING"""" and a discussion of the perils of typing. These alarming admonitions appear on a mostly plastic product that the Microsoft Corporation bills as """"natural."""" Natural? The Microsoft Natural Keyboard looks surreal, as if it had been fished from the seas bloated, warped and whitened. It is the latest member of a growing collection of odd-looking """"ergonomic"""" models pioneered in the general market by Apple Computer Inc. and sharing one tenet: the keyboards most of us use are unfit for human hands."
9/17/1994	Microsoft to Introduce New Windows NT	The Microsoft Corporation plans to renew its bid to become a big player in the network computing software market on Monday by introducing a new version of its Windows NT. While Microsoft dominates software for individual personal computers, it has never been big in software that links personal computers into large networks and connects those webs with big computers like I.B.M.'s mainframes.
9/14/1994	Computing's Bold Alliance Falters	It was to be the alliance of former enemies, teaming up to conquer common foes. At least that was the strategy three summers ago when I.B.M. and Apple Computer stunned their industry by announcing a joint plan to attack the domination of the personal computer industry by machines based on Intel chips and Microsoft software. Apple and I.B.M. called their planned weapon the Power PC, and to make sure they had sufficient firepower, they recruited the big chip maker Motorola Inc. to their team.
9/8/1994	New Shot By I.B.M. At Rivals	I.B.M., hoping to revive its desktop software business and exploit a delayed product introduction by the Microsoft Corporation, is about to introduce a more powerful, consumer-friendlier version of the OS/2 software operating system for personal computers. Although I.B.M.'s OS/2 software has been highly regarded by a core of technically proficient computer users since its introduction in 1987, it has been overwhelmed by the popularity of Microsoft's Windows operating system software. But now, in light of recent announcements by Microsoft that the next version of Windows would be delayed until next spring at the earliest, some analysts see a chance for I.B.M. to gain ground. Tough Fight Ahead The critically acclaimed improvements to OS/2, some of which were disclosed by I.B.M. today, include built-in, easy access to the Internet, the global web of computer networks. Even so, any market-share gains by OS/2 will be hard won, analysts caution.
9/7/1994	Health Net Takes Interactive Plunge	When -- if -- the interactive television future arrives, what might viewers do besides order movies and pizzas? How about researching the symptoms of gallstones? That is the idea with Health Net, an interactive television system demonstrated here today by a start-up company with technical assistance from the Microsoft Corporation and financial backing from the David Sarnoff Research Center. The Sarnoff center, formerly the research arm of the RCA electronics and broadcasting empire, is now an independent laboratory that conducts commercial research in telecommunications and computer technologies. Data Base Building Although the system is still only a rough prototype, the developer, Interactive Health Network Inc. of Princeton, N.J., has compiled a computerized data base of text and videos on health topics for consumers: information about diseases and injuries, fitness and nutrition, preventive medicine and mental health.
9/6/1994	Digital Makes PC for Business	The Digital Equipment Corporation introduced the Celebris line of desktop computers today. Digital said the Celebris computers would be easier to set up and expand and would be designed to run on the Microsoft Windows 4.0 operating system code-named Chicago.
9/6/1994	Microsoft Is Bringing Out Its First Computer Keyboard	Making its second foray into the computer hardware business, the Microsoft Corporation will begin shipping a keyboard on Tuesday with a suggested retail price of $99. Microsoft said the keyboard would be broadly available through computer retailers in early October.
9/4/1994	The Executive Computer; On the Road to Chicago, Little Time for Leisurely Reflection	YOU or your business may have been planning to take a slow trip to Chicago, the next iteration of the Microsoft Corporation's popular Windows operating system software for personal computers that is due out by the middle of next year. But the folks in Redmond, Wash., have another agenda: they think you should take an express train, if not the Concorde, and they do not intend to offer more leisurely options.
8/29/1994	Microsoft Winning Fight Over 'Windows'	When it comes to the Microsoft Corporation these days, the Government giveth and the Government giveth. In a well-publicized accord last month, the Justice Department settled a four-year investigation against the company in an agreement that many computer industry executives regard as favorable to the software giant.
8/25/1994	GATES TO SELL 1.23 MILLION OF HIS MICROSOFT SHARES	The chairman and chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation, Bill Gates, intends to sell about 1.23 million shares of Microsoft stock, according to a Federal filing. The shares are worth more than $68 million, based on Microsoft's closing trading price yesterday of $55.75, up 25 cents. Microsoft stock reached a record high of $56.375 on Tuesday. Officials at Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, would not comment on the filing. According to Microsoft, Mr. Gates owned more than 149.4 million Microsoft shares as of May 5, or about 24 percent of the shares outstanding. At current trading prices, the stake is worth about $8.3 billion. Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft with his high-school friend Mr. Gates, also intends to sell 200,000 shares, worth more than $11.1 million.
8/23/1994	Microsoft Names A New Agency	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday named Anderson & Lembke in San Francisco to handle its technical product advertising account, which had been at the Los Angeles office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide for the last six years. As Anderson was awarded the account, it was dismissed by its previous computer client, Sun Microsystems Inc. The Microsoft account, with billings estimated at $50 million, was one of several that Ogilvy Worldwide resigned when it won the International Business Machines Corporation's worldwide account in May. Christine Santucci, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., confirmed a report of the assignment yesterday in the Advertising Age Daily Fax.
8/22/1994	Euro RSCG Gets A Microsoft Account	The Microsoft Corporation has selected Euro RSCG in London to handle its account in Britain, which had been at the London office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide until that agency was awarded the worldwide I.B.M. account in May. Billings were estimated at $12 million.
8/7/1994	SUNDAY, August 7, 1994; Playing Games at Work	"At Microsoft these days, one of the terms loosely tossed around is """"Loosely Supervised Executive."""" It refers to just about anyone who has a few games on a workplace computer in addition to a spreadsheet and word processor. The term is an ironic recognition that with one hand, most software manufacturers make business tools, while with the other they make games, which inevitably are installed along with the serious programs. Software designers even provide """"boss buttons"""" to hide a game with one quick keystroke when a superior walks by, sometimes throwing a fake spreadsheet up on screen as a decoy."
8/5/1994	Corrections	"A chart in Business Day on July 27, with an article about the Microsoft Corporation's move into electronic publishing, misidentified the publisher of """"The Mayo Clinic Family Health Book"""" in CD-ROM computer disk form. The disk is published by IVI Publishing Inc., not Sony Electronic Publishing."
8/5/1994	An Impresario's High-Tech Big Top	"Paul G. Allen's private twin-engine Challenger jet is making its final approach to T. F. Green Airport. On board, Mr. Allen, the Microsoft Corporation's other co-founder, and David E. Liddle, head of Mr. Allen's Silicon Valley research company, are harmonizing. They emit an almost acceptable a cappella version of the Eagles' mid-70's hit """"Seven Bridges Road."
7/31/1994	The Executive Computer;Unsung OS/2 May Finally Be Getting Some Respect	LIKE the kid who always sits on the bench while the stars take the field and get the glory, I.B.M. is weary of all the attention being paid to Microsoft's new version of Windows, which is code-named Chicago and is expected to reach the market late this year or early next. Chicago is intended to be a 32-bit operating system, meaning it can process operations with 32 pieces of data at once, rather than the current 16. I.B.M.'s OS/2 already processes 32 bits. Chicago will feature an interface more like Apple's Macintosh, which should make it easier for new users. OS/2 already has that, too. Chicago will run all the current DOS and Windows applications software. OS/2 can, too.
7/27/1994	Now, Microsoft Wants To Gather Information	The Microsoft Corporation, fresh from a Federal antitrust settlement that did little to curb its dominance of the business software market, is now hoping to conquer an emerging field where the company's computer-nerd skills may, or may not, give it an edge: electronic publishing. Like many traditional paper-and-ink publishers, and many other software companies, Microsoft is busy acquiring information to fill CD-ROM's, shiny disks that look like music CD's but can each contain the equivalent of 250,000 pages of text for playback on personal computers. When done right, the technology can combine true-to-life video images, sound and animation in a multimedia package that both entertains and educates.
7/25/1994	An Energetic Trustbuster, but Not a Boat Rocker	"To the surprise of nobody, Anne K. Bingaman, in her first year as the top Justice Department trustbuster, has transformed a dormant antitrust operation into a fountain of activity, the ideal place for a veteran of the corporate litigation trenches to fulfill herself in making policy. """"This is the dream of my life,"""" Ms. Bingaman, who is 51, said in her Southwestern twang a few days after announcing that the Government had forced the Microsoft Corporation, the software giant, to change some of the ways it does business. """"I get out of bed every day and ask how could I be so lucky."
7/24/1994	The Executive Computer; Microsoft's Operating System Rivals Get a Boost, Sort Of	A decade is a long time in computer years, so it's easy to forget that when the I.B.M. PC was introduced at the outset of the 80's, Microsoft's MS-DOS was but one of several operating systems offered for the new machine. Today, so dominant are MS-DOS and its associated program, Windows, that it's not always apparent that there are still several viable alternatives. Those alternatives got a boost eight days ago when the United States Department of Justice and Microsoft signed a consent decree requiring the company to halt its longstanding practice of requiring computer manufacturers to pay a licensing fee on each machine sold, whether or not it contained DOS or Windows. In the past, such so-called O.E.M. customers have had little incentive to install another company's software because they would have to pay Microsoft anyway.
7/24/1994	Sound Bytes; I.B.M. Software Chief Sees an Opening for OS/2	WHEN the United States Department of Justice announced its settlement with the Microsoft Corporation eight days ago, perhaps no one was more pleased than Leland R. (Lee) Reiswig Jr., president of the IBM Personal Software Products Company in Austin, Tex. Mr. Reiswig's group is responsible for developing and marketing OS/2, I.B.M.'s operating system for personal computers. The consent decree requires Microsoft to end its long-standing practice of charging computer makers a licensing fee on each machine sold, whether or not it contained MS-DOS or Windows. Competitors say the licensing system inhibited competition.
7/21/1994	Economic Scene; The Microsoft case shows that trustbusters won't be referees.	MICROSOFT v. the United States and the European Union: What had all the makings of the global antitrust case of the decade ended with a whimper. Microsoft had been rumored to be facing strict monitoring of its relations with competitors and clients, or even a breakup of its operations into two companies. In the end, however, the Justice Department and its European counterpart demanded only modest changes in the way the giant software maker markets its products. Not surprisingly, the consent decree was greeted with dismay by rivals most vulnerable to Microsoft's juggernaut, notably those that produce software applications like word processing, along with those that produce utilities -- anti-virus programs, for example -- that are often sold as a package with Microsoft's basic operating system. What may surprise is the lack of a passionate response from antitrust economists and lawyers.
7/21/1994	A Fair Settlement on Microsoft	Friends of Microsoft feared that Anne Bingaman, head of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, would recklessly attack the company to showcase her desire to replace 12 years of Reagan-Bush indifference with a much tougher antitrust policy. She did not. The weekend settlement with Microsoft -- whose MS-DOS and Windows programs dominate the market for operating systems that run personal computers -- provides a useful fix to some anticompetitive practices. But it does not take unnecessary whacks at America's premier high-tech company. The settlement would require Microsoft to abandon several anticompetitive practices. For example, Microsoft would not be allowed to enter contracts with computer manufacturers that prevent them from doing business with Microsoft's competitors. And Microsoft could no longer charge manufacturers of personal computers according to the number of computers they manufactured -- whether or not they were loaded with Microsoft's operating system. This pricing system forced manufacturers who installed a competing operating system to pay, in effect, a second royalty. Justice correctly called for an end to these practices.
7/21/1994	Sybase Spurs Software Downturn	Investors fled shares of the software company Sybase today, leading to a broad downturn in software stocks. Despite beating Wall Street analysts' estimates and achieving record earnings and sales for its second quarter, Sybase saw its stock price plunge 18 percent on trading of more than 11 million shares -- the heaviest volume of any issue today.
7/19/1994	Microsoft's New System Promises to Fix Glitches	"GOIN' to Chicago,"""" runs the classic blues lyric, """"sorry, but I can't take you."""" It is a tune the Microsoft Corporation apparently hopes computer users will consider singing to their current Windows software. Chicago is the not-so-secret code name of the next version of Windows, the operating system that dominates the personal computer software market. Beginning in June a release dubbed """"Beta-1"""" (computerese for """"nowhere near ready for public consumption"""") was shipped to more than 10,000 test sites, and Microsoft now says the final edition should appear by late this year or early next year. Many industry experts do not expect it until as much as six months later."
7/19/1994	Microsoft	Far from tainting Microsoft's reputation, the antitrust settlement with and harsh words from the Justice Department did not seem to disturb the company's investors. Analysts say the Government could have taken more severe action, even a Bell System-style breakup. In its first full day of trading after the settlement, Microsoft's stock rose strongly.
7/18/1994	Microsoft's Future Barely Limited	Rather than reining in the Microsoft Corporation, the consent decree that the Justice Department announced over the weekend with Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, frees the company to define the computer industry's ground rules through the rest of the decade. The agreement leaves untouched what many computer industry executives say is Microsoft's principal advantage -- that it develops both the basic operating-system software that makes personal computers run, known as MS-DOS, and applications software, like word-processing programs or spreadsheets, that perform specific tasks.
7/17/1994	Microsoft's Grip on Software Loosened by Antitrust Deal	The Microsoft Corporation, which thus far has reigned as the premier creator of software for personal computers, bowed before Federal antitrust regulators today and agreed to immediately abandon a number of its important sales practices, which the Government said had smothered competition. Under a consent decree signed with the United States Justice Department on Friday night, Microsoft agreed to give computer manufacturers considerably more freedom to install programs from other companies.
7/17/1994	The Executive Computer; Moving to Microsoft's Chicago: If Not Why, When?	NEXT year, when you think of Chicago, you may not be thinking about Uno's deep-dish pizza, Mrs. O'Leary's destructive cow or Wrigley's bumbling Cubs. By that point, the Microsoft Corporation may have succeeded in convincing you that Chicago, the code name for the coming new version of Windows, is a software product you can't live without. Just last month, Microsoft kicked off a massive testing cycle aimed at hammering out the bugs, adding additional features here and there and making critical compatibility tweaks, all with the hope that it might deliver a finished product to customers before the end of the year. The software company then plans to spend more money convincing PC users that they need Chicago, or Windows 4.0, than it has spent on any product introduction in its history, although it declines to offer specific dollar figures.
7/16/1994	Microsoft and U.S. in Agreement To Settle Long Antitrust Dispute	The Microsoft Corporation reached a settlement today with the Justice Department to end a four-year antitrust battle over charges that the company unfairly tried to stifle competition. Under the agreement, which is set to be announced by the Justice Department over the weekend, Microsoft will change some of its business practices. The changes are expected to focus on Microsoft's licensing of the software used to run more than 50 million personal computers.
7/15/1994	Microsoft Negotiating A Settlement With U.S.	The Microsoft Corporation is in detailed discussions with the Justice Department over a possible settlement of the Government's long-running antitrust investigation, people familiar with the case said last night. The two sides are actively discussing a narrow range of issues in the hope of avoiding a broader and more protracted courtroom battle that would almost certainly last for years.
7/11/1994	Apple Offering New System for Macintosh PC's	Stung by a growing industry perception that the Microsoft Corporation is borrowing its best ideas, Apple Computer Inc. has introduced a version of its Macintosh software intended to maintain its lead in the personal computer ease-of-use wars. The announcement on Friday came as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit prepared to hear Apple's appeal of a Federal District Court ruling in 1993 that Microsoft and the Hewlett-Packard Company did not unfairly copy the distinctive on-screen appearance and functions of the Macintosh computer. The appeal will be heard on Monday.
6/27/1994	Wieden & Kennedy Gets Microsoft Job	"The Microsoft Corporation has named Wieden & Kennedy of Portland, Ore., as the first agency to handle """"broad reach"""" advertising, as the company calls image and branding ads that supplement its product advertising. Although billings were not disclosed, trade publications have estimated them at $40 million. Christine Santucci, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., said on Friday that Wieden & Kennedy was awarded the account after a three-month review that had narrowed to include two other finalists: the Leo Burnett Company of Chicago, and Ogilvy & Mather New York, which withdrew from the review last month after its parent, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, got the I.B.M. account."
6/26/1994	The Executive Computer; Microsoft Tackles the Enterprise Computing Riddle Anew	IF at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Has any company learned this childhood homily so well as Microsoft? These days, it is hard to recall that the overwhelmingly successful Windows program was the subject of nearly universal derision when it was introduced in 1985, or that Microsoft kept tinkering with it until version 3.0 finally clicked with the market five years later. Now Microsoft is playing a similar game with its products aimed at so-called enterprise computing, SQL Server and Windows NT.
6/24/1994	Disney Licenses Characters for Multimedia	America's favorite mouse has a multimedia future. The Walt Disney Company said yesterday that it had licensed the Microsoft Corporation and Sony Imagesoft to develop multimedia titles featuring Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters.
6/22/1994	Microsoft In Accord On Patent	The Microsoft Corporation, having emerged as the loser in a closely watched patent infringement suit brought by tiny Stac Electronics Inc., made its first big settlement in a patent case today by agreeing to license Stac's technology and acquire a minority equity stake in Stac. On Feb. 23, a jury in Federal District Court in Los Angeles found that a feature included in Microsoft's MS-DOS versions 6.0 and 6.2 computer operating system software infringed Stac's patents for data compression, which is a popular technology for doubling the data storage capacity of personal computer disks.
6/11/1994	Microsoft Dealt Blow By a Judge	A Federal judge in California has ordered the Microsoft Corporation, the largest software company in the world, to stop selling and recall from dealers and distributors two versions of its MS-DOS operating system, which is by far the most commonly used personal computer software. The ruling, issued late Thursday, exempts consumers and most business customers using the software from any penalty.
6/8/1994	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about stock market activity on Monday misstated the trading volume of the Microsoft Corporation's shares. A total of 47.8 million Microsoft shares were traded, not 4.8 million shares.
6/7/1994	New Baseball Disk: Hits and Errors	"WHEN will digital media supplant books, newspapers and magazines? """"Now!"""" cry on-line revolutionaries. """"Never!"""" retort paper-wielding traditionalists. A new CD-ROM makes both cases superbly. Complete Baseball, from the Microsoft Corporation, requires a Multimedia PC and will open its season Friday at a suggested ticket price of $79.95, or about $55 from """"scalpers."""" It is among the prettiest references on disk yet it does not stint on content. According to Microsoft spokesmen, the CD-ROM contains more than 7,500 images, 2,500 biographies (including current players, whose """"biographies"""" consist only of vital statistics), 84 audio clips, 12 video clips, and a featured collection of 100 articles from The New York Times."
6/5/1994	Wall Street; Microsoft Seems to Be Making Everybody Happy	"INSIDERS have been doing scattered selling of Microsoft stock and outsiders couldn't be happier about buying. Standard & Poor's said on May 12 that it would add Microsoft to its S.& P. 500 index of large stocks. Shares of the software company have since moved 13 percent higher, to close at $52.875 on Friday. Institutional investors frequently use investment programs in which they simply allocate their money among shares of a well-known index, and the S.& P. 500 is by far the most popular index in that game. Thus, the movement of big money to Microsoft. Officers, directors, and affiliated persons who are deemed """"insiders"""" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, have been filing with the S.E.C. to disclose that they have been sellers of Microsoft."
5/28/1994	An I.B.M. Reshaping In Software	I.B.M. overhauled the management of its software-development programs yesterday to try to regain business it has lost to rivals like the Microsoft Corporation. By better coordinating its efforts, the International Business Machines Corporation hopes to reduce the estimated $1 billion it spends annually in developing its various software operating systems.
5/25/1994	Microsoft and Rogers Plan Interactive Cable Venture	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it had signed a letter of intent with Rogers Cablesystems Ltd., Canada's largest cable television company, to provide software for an interactive cable system that will be deployed in the first half of 1996. The agreement is a significant victory for Microsoft, which had been negotiating with big cable and telephone companies for more than a year to try to stake out its turf in an emerging national system to provide digital video, home shopping and other interactive services through telephone and cable networks.
5/22/1994	The Executive Computer; Preparing for the Battle in Mix-and-Match Software	SO far in the 1990's the software business has seen a continuous battle for control of the most visible aspect of computing: the graphical user interface. In this war, Apple Computer's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows have vied for the hearts and eyes of the computing public with their competing software systems: each is based on the concept of executing commands by pointing and clicking at pictographs on a screen instead of typing arcane words or numbers.
5/18/1994	Next From Microsoft, Movies on Demand	"Making its long-anticipated entry into the emerging multimedia marketplace, the Microsoft Corporation introduced its new software for delivering movies on demand yesterday. Microsoft said the technology, called Tiger, could provide media-on-demand for services ranging from one small computer supplying movies to hotel guests to a more powerful machine satisfying the needs of several hundred corporate users, to large systems supplying tens of thousands of movie titles to hundreds of thousands of cable-television customers. The company, based in Redmond, Wash., said Tiger would first be deployed in a video-on-demand field trial to be jointly run with Tele-Communications Inc. in the Seattle area later this year. Numerous Applications Seen Movies on demand is just the first likely application of Tiger technology, Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's senior vice president of advanced technology, said yesterday. """"Regardless of where it originates, more and more information is being digitized; as it becomes digitized you need a repository and that's what Tiger is all about,"""" he said."
5/2/1994	Microsoft Review Narrowed to Three	The Microsoft Corporation has narrowed a review to select its first agency for a proposed worldwide image account to three shops from six. Though billings were not disclosed, trade publications have estimated them at $40 million.
4/19/1994	MICROSOFT CORP. (MSFT:NMS)	The Microsoft Corporation reported quarterly profits yesterday that were above analysts' expectations, led by strong sales of its Windowsoperating system and its bundled offering of business applications, called Office. Margins -- profits before taxes, interest payments and special charges -- rose to 38.6 percent, from 35.3 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Many analysts had expecteded, and the software giant previously signalled, that margins would decline as its growth rate tapered off.
4/10/1994	Megabytes Are Important	"To the Editor: Bernard Sharratt makes a startling point. With so many copies available, by the time one ventures into a dusty museum """"the work itself can seem just another reproduction"""" and perhaps a disappointing one. This raises an interesting question: Are we any different from Narcissus in the ways in which we snatch up reproductions of art? One must remember that he, too, fell in love with a reproduction, and it led to his end."
4/10/1994	Megabytes Are Important	"To the Editor: Congratulations on entering the literary electronics age with Bernard Sharratt's review of """"Microsoft Art Gallery: The Collection of the National Gallery, London"""" (March 6). That's a first -- and I hope not the last."
4/7/1994	Software Publishing Corp. to Cut Its Work Force in Half	Battered by larger competitors with broader product lines, the Software Publishing Corporation said today that it would cut its work force in half and take a restructuring charge for its second quarter, which ended on March 31. In addition, Fred Gibbons, the company's founder, will resign as chief executive but will continue as chairman.
3/26/1994	A Patent Fight Over Disks	Compton's Multimedia Publishing Group, a unit of the Tribune Company, lost the first round in a patent battle this week when the Patent Office rejected its claims to a multimedia patent. The Microsoft Corporation and Time Warner Inc. have contested Compton's claims to control CD-ROM's, the computer disks that are the most popular way to retrieve text, photo, audio, animation and video information from multimedia data bases, the Patent Office said.
3/25/1994	Mtel to Join Microsoft In Data Deal	The Microsoft Corporation and the Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corporation said yesterday that they would jointly develop a nationwide wireless network for sending and receiving data from a variety of electronic devices, including laptop computers. Shares of Mobile Telecommunications Technologies, which is known as Mtel, soared yesterday on the news to close at $20.50, up $4.625, in Nasdaq trading. Shares of Microsoft rose $1, to $87.25.
3/24/1994	Microsoft and N.T.T. in Delivery Venture	The Microsoft Corporation, which recently failed to forge a strategic alliance with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, has found a phone company partner after all. Microsoft, the American software giant, said today that it had agreed in principle with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Japan's main phone company, to jointly develop services for delivery of multimedia information and software over communications networks.
3/22/1994	Microsoft and A.T.&T.'s Brief Fling	Even as Craig O. McCaw and William H. Gates planned their newly disclosed $9 billion satellite communications venture, Mr. McCaw was attempting to play matchmaker between Mr. Gates's Microsoft Corporation and top officials of A.T.& T. in an effort to draw the two companies into a strategic alliance. For three months, the world's largest software and telecommunications companies have been secretly exploring a series of potential joint ventures including interactive television, on-line computer services and software.
3/21/1994	AN ORBITING SYSTEM IS PLANNED TO LINK MOST OF THE GLOBE	Two of the nation's wealthiest entrepreneurs in communications and computers, Craig O. McCaw and William H. Gates, plan to disclose on Monday the formation of a company to develop a global satellite communications network far more ambitious than anything contemplated before. Indeed, the project is so big and so radically different from current satellite systems that it might be dismissed as an idle fantasy were it not for the two people behind it: Mr. McCaw, who built McCaw Cellular Communications into the largest cellular telephone company, and Mr. Gates, who turned the Microsoft Corporation into the biggest software company in the world.
3/16/1994	Indiscretion in Software	"Microsoft Word for Windows, a leading word-processing program, has a flaw that can allow the readers of documents to retrieve material that the writer had deleted. Fred Langa, the editorial director of Windows magazine, reports in the May issue that under some circumstances, recipients of a file sent by E-mail or disk or shared on a network """"still may be able to read at least some of your original, raw remarks."""" The May issue of Windows magazine goes on sale in mid- to late April. The magazine, which has a circulation of about 450,000, is published by C.M.P. Publications of Manhasset, L.I."
3/6/1994	The Executive Computer; Will Users Be the Big Losers in Software Patent Battles?	EVERYONE loves a David and Goliath story, so computer users probably enjoyed a moment of glee recently when a pipsqueak company called Stac Electronics won a $120 million jury award against Microsoft for patent infringement. But analysts and programmers say such broad interpretations of intellectual property law do more harm than good. And the ultimate losers may be computer users. Blatant copying or counterfeiting is one thing, programmers say, but when software companies use patents or copyrights to block competition, they are denying users a choice and stifling innovation to preserve artificial monopolies.
3/4/1994	A New Joint Test of Interactive TV	In the latest linkup of computing and communications giants, the Microsoft Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc. said today that they had agreed to jointly test interactive cable television systems. Tele-Communications will supply the network for the systems, while Microsoft will supply new software that will control the movement of the interactive media. The systems will first be tested among Tele-Communications and Microsoft employees in the Seattle area later this year. The second phase will include a marketing test of interactive television services among Tele-Communications cable customers in the Seattle and Denver areas, beginning in 1995.
2/25/1994	Shares of Stac Electronics Rise on Ruling	Shares of Stac Electronics Inc. soared today, a day after the company won a $120 million judgment against the Microsoft Corporation in a patent infringement case. Stac contended in a suit filed in January 1993 that Microsoft had appropriated its technology for compressing data stored on computer hard disks.
2/24/1994	Microsoft Loses Case On Patent	A Federal court jury found the Microsoft Corporation guilty of patent infringement today and awarded $120 million in damages to a small California company that had accused Microsoft of appropriating its technology for increasing the storage capacity of computer disks. The judgment in favor of Stac Electronics Inc. came in the first patent infringement suit against Microsoft ever to reach a trial.
2/22/1994	Putting Shells Within Shells	"A WINDOWS shell sounds like a contradiction in terms. Microsoft Windows is itself a shell (although the preferred term these days is """"environment"""") that puts icons and dialogue boxes between the user and the fussy DOS command line. Other companies try to improve Windows by wrapping it in another shell, and some succeed. Dashboard, from Hewlett-Packard, places a strip on the screen that shows the time and date, the amount of system resources that Windows is taking up and the kilobytes of memory consumed, and provides 27 """"buttons"""" to push to start programs, to print out files and to do a large number of other things with its gauges, arrows and other gadgets."
2/20/1994	Sound Bytes; The Envoy From Microsoft	AT any computer industry gathering, if you bump into Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, usually not far away you will also find Jonathan Lazarus, the company's vice president for systems strategy. In the intensely political personal computer industry, Mr. Lazarus is seen as the secretary of state for the software industry's most influential company. It is a position that is not without its knocks. Competitors are intensely jealous of Microsoft's success and often accuse the software publisher of acting as a monopolist.
2/15/1994	Cleaning Windows, Both Files And Icons	MICROSOFT WINDOWS was intended to make our lives at the PC easier, and in many ways it does, until it is time to get rid of a program. It is easy to delete the icon representing a program, but its files remain on the hard disk. It is easy enough to delete the files, either with the Windows File Manager or by going to DOS, but the icon remains. It takes two separate operations to delete the icon and its files. And the program may have added lines to WIN.INI or one of the other crucial Windows files.
2/15/1994	Oracle Hopes to Steal A March on Microsoft	What if they gave a party and nobody invited Bill Gates of Microsoft? Universally feared in the computer industry because of his company's domination of the software market, William H. Gates 3d has been attempting to stake out a similar claim to the emerging world of interactive television.
2/15/1994	An Acquisition By Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it would acquire Softimage Inc., a Canadian developer of computer animation and visualization software used in movie and video special effects applications. The acquisition is an important one for Microsoft, which has been trying to strengthen its role in the emerging market for interactive television and multimedia production.
1/24/1994	Patents; A Software-technology infringement case against Microsoft goes to trial in Federal court.	THE stakes are high in the first patent-infringement case against the Microsoft Corporation ever to reach trial. Last week, Federal District Judge Edward Rafeedie impaneled a jury in the patent dispute between Stac Electronics, based in Carlsbad, Calif., and Microsoft, the Redmond, Wash., company that is the largest vendor of personal computer software in the world. The trial, which started on Tuesday, is expected to last three to four weeks.
1/23/1994	SUNDAY, January 23, 1994; Htijx ktw Pnix	"The scrambling and decoding of electronic communication is one of the hottest issues in cyberpolitics. The Government would like to have the key to all communications. Export of cryptographic software is restricted. Both software companies and independent groups like the Cypherpunks argue for the rights of individual privacy. All of which makes Microsoft's new Creative Writer software for children intriguing. It includes some primitive cryptographic tools to enable kids to encode what they write (the headline above is """"Codes for Kids,"""" encoded by the program) to hide it from curious siblings and F.B.I. agents."
1/20/1994	Microsoft Has 22% Rise In Earnings	"The Microsoft Corporation reported today that it had a 22 percent gain in fiscal second-quarter earnings, which it attributed to strong sales of Microsoft Office, its """"suite"""" of programs including word processing, data base, spreadsheet and graphics. The earnings met or exceeded most analysts' estimates."
1/18/1994	Microsoft Will Supply Software for Sega	The Microsoft Corporation will supply portions of the basic software for controlling the new video game machine to be introduced late this year by Sega Enterprises, according to people familiar with the agreement. Microsoft, which dominates the market for personal computer operating system software, has been seeking to extend its reach by developing basic controlling software for hand-held information appliances, office equipment and advanced cable television systems. The agreement to contribute to an operating system for Sega, one of the top companies in the video game business, could represent a big stride beyond personal computing for Microsoft. Operating system software controls the inner workings of computers and computer-like devices.
1/5/1994	Market Place; Microsoft's hypergrowth could ease, some analysts say.	LAST year was not a great year for Microsoft stock. The Redmond, Wash., software powerhouse rose above $92 during two months but ended yesterday at $80.50, up 37.5 cents. Indeed, while Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, William H. Gates 3d, and Melinda French were being married last week in Hawaii, the company's stock faltered again slightly after several analysts said they expected the company's remarkable 48 percent earnings growth rate for the last four years to slow in 1994.
12/28/1993	Market Place; Home Software's Treasure Hunt	A decade after experts predicted that Americans would rush to buy personal computers for their homes, the promise of home computing -- families puttering away on everything from glitzy games to household budgets -- finally seems to be on its way to reality. The relentless advance of personal computer technology, making ever-more powerful machines affordable, is part of the story. But it is the software makers, not the hardware companies, that will once again probably get the real money and the price-earnings multiples. And there are plenty of signs that the home software gold rush is well under way: the Microsoft Corporation, the big winner in the business software market, is making a push and hundreds of upstarts have entered the market.
12/15/1993	U.S. Concerns Split Over Japan Law	Several American computer companies are arguing in favor of a change in Japan's copyright law that the United States Government and many other American companies vigorously oppose. The break in the unified front of the American computer industry at a hearing here Monday could make it easier for Japan's Government to justify the revision of the law.
12/14/1993	Exploring the Frontiers Of Electronics at Home	"AFTER more than a decade of providing software for the business community, the Microsoft Corporation is going home. The Redmond, Wash., software giant, which is best known for its DOS-Windows operating systems, programming languages and business applications, last week created a new Microsoft Consumer division to develop entertainment and creativity programs for Windows and Macintosh computers. The new division inherits more than 30 existing Microsoft programs that now fall into the """"home"""" category, including titles like Flight Simulator, Works, Publisher, Cinemania, Multimedia Beethoven and an assortment of Windows games. Embracing the philosophy that all work and no play makes Bill a dull boy, Microsoft plans to increase the offerings to more than 100 titles in the next year."
12/12/1993	Sound Bytes; A Glimpse Into the Future As Seen by Chairman Gates	AS chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest maker of personal computer software, Bill Gates is arguably the industry's most powerful executive. Microsoft makes the DOS, Windows and Windows NT operating systems as well as programming languages and tools, and the company is the top producer of application software for Windows and Macintosh computers. After dominating the business software market the last decade, Microsoft last week announced a new division to create and market software and services for the home. Before making the announcement, Mr. Gates met with editors and reporters of The New York Times to discuss the new venture. Following are excerpts from the discussion:
12/8/1993	Nippon Seeks Alliances	The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation is discussing separately with the Microsoft Corporation and the Apple Computer Corporation possible alliances to explore new businesses, the president of the huge Japanese telephone phone company, Masashi Kojima, said today.
12/8/1993	Nippon Phone Seeks Alliances	"The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation is talking separately with the Microsoft Corporation and with the Apple Computer Corporation about possible alliances to explore new businesses, the president of the Japanese phone company said today. Masashi Kojima, N.T.T.'s president, said he had met with Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and Apple's president, Michael Spindler, and N.T.T. had formed working groups with each company to explore what he called """"quite exciting"""" opportunities that would combine computing and telecommunications."
12/7/1993	Microsoft Aims for Younger Market	The Microsoft Corporation, the world's leading maker of personal-computer software, is aiming its formidable marketing arsenal at a new target -- 10-year-olds. The company's entry into the children's software market begins today with the introduction of Creative Writer, a writing program with animated cartoon characters to guide kids through the mysteries of computing. A drawing package, Fine Artist, is scheduled to go on sale in March.
11/30/1993	MICROSOFT AND DIGITAL TO SET A SOFTWARE STANDARD	"The Microsoft Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation said yesterday that they had agreed to establish a common software standard intended to permit companies' object-oriented programming systems to work together. Object-oriented programming lets programmers re-use prebuilt software building blocks for faster design and programming. Until now, Microsoft has been one of very few significant computer companies that have not participated in an industry group called the Object Management Group, which is working to standardize object module interfaces between companies. But yesterday William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said Microsoft's agreement with Digital would lead to a """"layer of commonality"""" between Microsoft's objects and those of other computer vendors like Hewlett Packard, Sun Microsystems, I.B.M. and Apple."
11/28/1993	Sound Bytes; What's Ahead for Software? Simpler Stuff, Easily Used	Mike Maples is executive vice president for the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., responsible for all product development and marketing at the world's largest personal computer software company. Before joining Microsoft in 1988, Mr. Maples was director of software strategy for the International Business Machines Corporation. We caught up with him at the Comdex/Fall trade show earlier this month in Las Vegas, just before he left on a deer-hunting trip. Question: What kind of software will we be using five years from now?
11/14/1993	The Executive Computer; Another Drop-In Guest Could Crash a Big Event in Vegas	THE heavyweights of the personal computer industry are preparing once again to slug it out in Las Vegas, Nev., where the annual Comdex/Fall trade show opens tomorrow. The tone for this year's extravaganza was set earlier this month when a man in a powered parachute sailed down into the Las Vegas boxing ring where Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe were fighting for the heavyweight title. If there is a similar disruption this week, it will be the arrival of the Power PC chip. The chip is a new microprocessor forged by the alliance of International Business Machines, Apple Computer and Motorola. It could drop into the ring where the Intel Corporation -- the heavyweight champ for the past decade -- is beating the chips out of its many challengers.
11/11/1993	I.B.M. Ships New Version Of OS/2 Operating Software	I.B.M. said today that it was shipping a version of its OS/2 operating system software aimed at customers who already own a copy of the Windows program made by the Microsoft Corporation. Unlike previous editions of OS/2, the new product, OS/2 for Windows, does not include Windows itself, and I.B.M. said it would not pay Microsoft a royalty.
11/2/1993	Install In Haste, Repent At Leisure	IT was past time to learn something about OS/2, the high-level operating system from I.B.M. that will replace DOS, that faithful old clunker, unless Microsoft's Windows NT or a variation of UNIX wins the desktop battle. A phone call to Micro Warehouse, a mail-order concern whose catalogue happened to be on top of the tallest pile on the desk, brought the 5.25-inch disk edition of OS/2 2.1 a few days later. The suggested retail price is $278.95; the actual price was $149.95. In the same catalogue, Windows NT is $279.95, with a suggested retail price of $295.
10/31/1993	The Executive Computer; Microsoft Springs Forward in Word Processing Software	THERE is no such thing as the final word in word processing software. The three leading programs for Windows computers -- Microsoft Word, Wordperfect and Ami Pro -- regularly leapfrog one another with new and better features. This month, after two years of development, both Microsoft Word and Wordperfect hopped up with new versions. It is always difficult to choose a winner in word processing software, simply because all three of the leading programs are so good. In this latest round, the good get better.
10/26/1993	In War of Words, Advanced Micro Gains 2	"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has added a powerful ally in its war of words with the Intel Corporation: the Microsoft Corporation. In a move clearly intended to add credibility to its clones of Intel's microprocessors, Advanced Micro said today it had entered into a licensing agreement with Microsoft to use the """"Windows Compatible"""" logo on its Am386 and Am486DX microprocessor packaging, advertising and collateral marketing materials. Intel and Advanced Micro are in protracted litigation over Advanced Micro's rights to make clones of Intel chips."
10/24/1993	The Executive Computer; An Ensemble From Microsoft Is Greater Than Its Parts	IT'S a powerful new tool for creating business documents. It's a diabolical scheme for domination of the desktops of corporate America. It's a great bargain. It's a potentially lethal threat to smaller software companies. Microsoft Office version 4.0 -- an all-in-one package comprising the Windows versions of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Mail -- is greater than the sum of its parts. The latest version of Microsoft Office, introduced last week, has the potential to change the way business users of personal computers buy and use software.
10/21/1993	MICROSOFT CORP. (NMS)	"The Microsoft Corporation reported a 14 percent gain in earnings and a 20 percent gain in revenues for the first quarter yesterday. But the results were near the low end of estimates by Wall Street analysts. """"The company had telegraphed that this wasn't going to be a great quarter,"""" said Bruce M. Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist Inc. """"There are still concerns about pricing pressures,"""" he said."
10/19/1993	Putting Everything in a Notebook, Neatly Tabbed	"THE COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION, in a welcome effort to make personal computers easier to use, has teamed up with the originators of the graphical user interface to create a much simpler way to work with Microsoft Windows software. Novice computer users especially, but also many experienced Windows users, will find it a cause for rejoicing. The ease of use comes about through special software called Tab Works that Compaq, a hardware company, plans to install on most of its future computer models, company officials said yesterday. Tab Works is basically a """"shell"""" for Windows that reorganizes files and applications in a notebook metaphor that will be familiar even to people who have not used a computer before."
10/16/1993	Wordperfect Sues Microsoft in Ad Dispute	The Wordperfect Corporation filed a court complaint yesterday seeking to block the Microsoft Corporation from claiming that its word processsing software was the most popular in the world. Wordperfect also figured in a report yesterday in Computer Reseller News, a trade publication, that said the company was in talks regarding the acquisition of Borland International. Neither company would comment, but they have collaborated recently to offer Borland Office, a suite of products that combines Wordperfect's word processor with Borland's data base and spreadsheet programs.
10/15/1993	Microsoft Seeks to Pad Wide Lead in PC Suites	"Amid a light show, music and fanfare, William Gates of Microsoft will stride onto the stage at the Hudson Theater in Manhattan next week to raise the ante in the """"suite wars,"""" a battle for the fastest-growing part of the personal computer software business. Suites are bundles of applications like spreadsheets, word processing and graphics, sold together for a fraction of the cost if the programs were purchased individually. These office packages are hot sellers in corporate America, with sales growing nearly 40 percent a year, twice the rate of the total applications market."
10/10/1993	The Executive Computer; Free Technical Support: An Endangered Species of Service	"THERE is no such thing as a free lunch, and there may soon be no such thing as a free technical support call. As prices and profit margins fall in the personal computer software industry, some software makers are charging their customers for what was once """"free"""" technical advice. The Microsoft Corporation, for example, has revamped its technical support programs, and part of the plan includes new """"priority"""" and """"premium"""" fees for customers who call outside business hours seeking solutions to their problems."
10/3/1993	Sound Bytes; Drawing on Family Values To Fight the Software Wars	"AS a graduate student in Utah in 1969, Alan Ashton proposed two summer projects: linking the school's organ to a computer for """"music by numbers,"""" or developing a word processing program. His professors chose the music project. Nine years later Mr. Ashton revived the word processing idea as a way to augment his teacher's salary and support his growing family, and today he is president of the Wordperfect Corporation, the maker of the Wordperfect word processing program and the largest privately held company in the personal computer software industry. The company has estimated sales of more than $500 million a year."
10/2/1993	Microsoft To Display New Line	The Microsoft Corporation plans to introduce a new product line on Monday focusing on the home computing market. The creation of the Microsoft Home brand will bring together a variety of the company's software applications into a single product line combining the categories of home business, games and multimedia.
9/28/1993	Taking Three New Tacks on Moving the Cursor	IT is a shame most of us have only two hands, because there are three new hand-related personal computer products worth grabbing. The Microsoft Corporation, an elephant among companies, has once again labored mightily to bring forth yet another mouse. This new one is called the Microsoft Ballpoint 2.0, and it clips onto the side of a laptop or notebook computer to function as a miniature trackball.
9/26/1993	Sound Bytes; To This Microsoft Executive, the 'Suite' Smells of Success	"Pete Higgins is vice president for desktop applications at the Microsoft Corporation, responsible for the development of Windows and Macintosh versions of Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint, and the hottest product of the moment, Microsoft Office. Office is a """"suite,"""" or collection of programs that includes Word, Excel and Powerpoint plus Microsoft Mail and Microsoft Access, all sold in a bundle. All told, desktop applications generate about half of Microsoft's revenue each year. Word processing alone is worth half a billion dollars a year, and despite the hoopla about Microsoft Windows 3.1, Mr. Higgins's Macintosh applications group reportedly generates as much revenue as does Windows. In his spare time, Mr. Higgins oversees Microsoft's Usability Labs, an ambitious effort to make software easier to use, and the Interoperability Design Group, which develops core integration technologies for all Microsoft products."
9/25/1993	Apple Executive Is Let Go and Sues	The Apple Computer executive and board member who handled the Apple-Microsoft suit was laid off Thursday and immediately resigned from the board and sued Apple over his severance. The departure of Albert A. Eisenstat, a 13-year employee who was the company's executive vice president and in charge of its legal affairs, is the most recent of several executive departures at Apple.
9/14/1993	For Desktop Advice, A Publishing Wizard	A PROFESSIONAL desktop publisher needs the best tools: a hefty computer system, a top-rated printer and a powerful piece of software like Aldus Pagemaker or Quarkxpress. But many other people must occasionally produce printed materials, or would do so if it were not so much trouble to learn and remember the ins and outs of the major programs. Broderbund's Print Shop has fitted into the easy to learn and recall department for years, and keeps improving as powerful personal computers become more common. (Good news for Macintosh owners; a Mac version of Print Shop is almost here.) Still, there is plenty of room for other programs.
9/12/1993	They'd Rather Be Jamming	"ON weekends, Phillipe Kahn, the highly visible chief executive of the software powerhouse Borland International, disguises himself in a fake mustache, dark glasses and hat, and joins a group of musician friends to play his flute at weddings and bar mitzvahs in Silicon Valley. """"I play the theme from 'The Godfather' or Whitney Houston's latest hit,"""" Mr. Kahn said. """"I do it for fun."
9/11/1993	Microsoft to Charge for Technical Help	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it would begin charging for some of the technical support provided to customers. While individual users of Microsoft applications, like word processing or spreadsheet software, will still be able to have questions answered at no charge by telephone, large customers with more elaborate needs will be offered various options, ranging from a $25-a-call fee to a $20,000 annual charge, Microsoft said.
9/9/1993	TOSHIBA AND MICROSOFT TEAM UP ON SOFTWARE	The ToshibaCorporation and the MicrosoftCorporation said today that they would work more closely on future computer operating system software aimed at portable computers and handheld information appliances. Toshiba said it would license Microsoft's At Work software, a system being developed to tie together all types of office equipment, and will incorporate the software into handheld devices it is developing. A Toshiba spokesman said the company will get earlier access to information about Microsoft's operating systems, allowing the company to develop products quicker.
9/7/1993	Microsoft Faces an Inquiry in Europe	The inquiry into the Microsoft Corporation's business practices has been extended to Europe. Microsoft, the largest creator of software for personal computers, said yesterday that Novell Inc. had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming unfair trading practices.
9/5/1993	The Executive Computer; Is Borland Using a Two-Edged Sword in Battling for Sales?	WHEN they are in danger of being consumed by a rapidly spreading forest blaze, firefighters often light a second fire parallel to the first. If all goes as planned, the secondary fire will destroy the fuel for the oncoming blaze and deprive it of oxygen. It is a very risky maneuver, since firefighters must also survive their own flames. And that is the position of Borland International Inc., which decided late last month to sell its new Quattro Pro for Windows 5.0 spreadsheet for less than $50. Trapped between not one but two onrushing infernos, in the form of Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel, Borland chose to light a fire under its own spreadsheet.
8/23/1993	Microsoft Confronts Its Success	In seizing the mantle of computer industry leadership from I.B.M., the Microsoft Corporation is earning the headaches of power as well as the influence. The extent of the software publisher's legal problems became clearer on Friday. Shortly after the Federal Trade Commission ended a 38-month investigation into Microsoft's business practices, the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department said that it would pursue its own inquiry.
8/21/1993	Microsoft Antitrust Case Shifts	The Federal Trade Commission officially closed its antitrust investigation of the Microsoft Corporation today, but the Justice Department announced an inquiry of its own. The F.T.C. told Microsoft in a letter dated today that it would take no action on accusations that the software manufacturer had engaged in unfair competition. But the Justice Department, which asked earlier this summer to examine the evidence the commission had collected, said it would take up the case.
8/10/1993	Motorola Said to Buy Right To New Microsoft Software	Motorola Inc. has reportedly bought the rights to use the Microsoft Corporation's new operating system software, Windows NT, with Motorola's Power PC line of microprocessors. The Power PC chip, developed jointly by Motorola, the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc., is aimed at breaking the near-monopoly of the Intel Corporation in supplying the central chip in personal computers.
8/5/1993	Microsoft in Deal With Continuum	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it would purchase, for an undisclosed amount, certain technology and product development efforts from the Continuum Productions Corporation, a Bellevue, Wash., company entirely owned by William H. Gates 3d, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive. Analysts said the acquisition might reflect a realization at Microsoft that its core products -- operating system software and applications -- have matured and can no longer sustain the company's historic sales growth. Bringing in new technology from Continuum could provide future growth for Microsoft, these analysts said.
8/2/1993	Microsoft Installing a Team For New Look in Computers	Seeking to influence the design of a new generation of more powerful consumer-oriented computers, the Microsoft Corporation has hired a small team of supercomputer engineers, company executives said today. The world's largest software company has no intention of entering the supercomputer industry, the officials noted. Instead Microsoft wants to take the expertise of those who design the world's fastest computers and apply it to problems that personal computer companies are facing in creating a new class of computing devices that will control future digital television sets and other consumer appliances.
8/1/1993	Justice Department Considers Inquiry on Microsoft	The Justice Department is exploring whether it should investigate the Microsoft Corporation for possible antitrust violations, a Government official involved in the review says. The move comes after the Federal Trade Commission deadlocked on July 21 for the second time in its 37-month inquiry into whether to charge the world's largest software publisher with unfairly dominating the $7 billion market for personal computer software.
7/29/1993	MICROSOFT CORP. (NMS)	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that both income and revenues at the computer software company were up sharply for the fourth quarter and for all of fiscal 1993. The company's chairman, William H. Gates, said continued strong sales of Microsoft Windows were a key factor. Microsoft has distributed more than 30 million copies of Windows and continues to ship more than one million copies a month, he said. The company's Windows/NT operating system, announced in May, has not yet contributed to the balance sheet, though Microsoft said Monday that it had begun retail distribution.
7/22/1993	F.T.C. Stays Deadlocked On Microsoft	The Federal Trade Commission remained deadlocked today over whether to charge the world's biggest software publisher, the Microsoft Corporation, with engaging in anticompetitive business practices, according to executives familiar with the outcome of the commission's meeting. The meeting in Washington, which was held in an attempt to break a February deadlock vote by the four commissioners taking part, lasted more than three hours. After it ended today, Donald Elder, an F.T.C. spokesman, said that no decision had been reached in the matter. The F.T.C. has refused to acknowledge publicly that it is conducting an investigation of Microsoft's business practices, even though the company itself has said an inquiry has been taking place.
7/19/1993	For Microsoft's Rivals, It's a Question of Fairness	Is the software industry leader Bill Gates accountable to a higher authority? Look for an answer this week, when the Federal Trade Commission is expected to consider longstanding industry complaints that the Microsoft Corporation competes unfairly. For years rivals of the Microsoft have groused publicly and privately that the company and its chairman, William H. Gates, have used hardball tactics to dominate the software business. They say Microsoft has unfairly leveraged its near monopoly in personal computer operating system software, linking it with sales of its spreadsheet, word-processing and other application software that faces greater competition. They also accuse the company of nefarious pricing schemes. And they even contend that Mr. Gates has inserted devious code into his programs to make non-Microsoft programs incompatible with the company's products.
6/15/1993	Wills & Evans Seeks Creative Director	R. Scott Wills, president at Wills & Evans Inc. in New York, said yesterday that by the end of July he planned to name a successor to Ben Evans, the agency's executive vice president and creative director, who will leave to become creative director at the Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash.
6/13/1993	A Quiet Liberation for Gay and Lesbian Employees	"SHE is a successful stockbroker in a Midwestern city, recently turned 40, and a lesbian. Sure, she said, she would be willing to talk about being gay in corporate America, but she hasn't come out at her prominent brokerage and would prefer not to have her name used. Then she paused, and laughed. """"Actually, I guess I'm in the process of coming out,"""" she said. """"A notice from Commando Queers came through our fax machine a couple of days ago."""" Even before that fax passed through the hands of secretaries and clerks, she figures, her co-workers knew. But they didn't ask and she didn't talk about it."
6/13/1993	Microsoft and 2 Cable Giants Close to an Alliance	Three dominant technology and entertainment companies are on the verge of joining forces to create the equivalent of software for cable television -- an operating system that would combine the worlds of computing and television and perhaps shape how much of popular culture is delivered. Time Warner Inc., the largest entertainment company; Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable television company, and the Microsoft Corporation, the largest software company, are expected to announce by the end of the month that they will form a company, tentatively called Cablesoft. This new venture, its creators hope, will lead the way in establishing a standard for the transmission of the coming generation of interactive programs.
6/13/1993	Sound Bytes; Everything Intelligent, And All of It Connected	KAREN HARGROVE is general manager, digital office systems, for the Microsoft Corporation. She is responsible for implementing Microsoft's vision of integrating personal computers with other office technologies, including printers, facsimile machines, photocopiers, personal communicators and telephones, using software called Windows at Work as the common command system. Before joining Microsoft, Ms. Hargrove worked on advanced hardware design and software development for the Digitial Equipment Corporation.
6/9/1993	Software Giant Aiming at the Office	The Microsoft Corporation, the software giant, is trying to extend its powerful reach beyond the computer to the rest of office machinery -- the copier, the printer, the fax, even the phone. For more than a year, William H. Gates, the company's 37-year-old chairman, has circled the globe, signing up equipment makers to become part of his vision of an office in which machines can pass work from one to another seamlessly, thanks to Microsoft software.
6/8/1993	Following A Mouse Through History	A COMPUTER can teach you about computers. Computerworks, a program from the Software Marketing Corporation of Phoenix, offers a colorful and lively series of on-screen lessons. Most of each screen is taken up by a picture of the component being studied. Along the top is a Windows-style menu bar (the DOS program can work under but does not require Windows) and along the bottom are two rows of icons, 16 in all, standing for the available choices: computer systems, display systems, disk drives and storage (memory would better have been called the less anthropomorphic storage, but it is too late now), printers and plotters, keyboards and input devices, circuit boards and electronic components, software, peripherals and cables, history of computers, as well as buttons to reach the index, related topics, a notepad, lessons and quizzes, and to print, get help or quit.
6/7/1993	A New Notebook Computer	Betting that less is more, where mobile computing is concerned, the Hewlett-Packard Company and the Microsoft Corporation will jointly introduce a new 2.9-pound notebook computer on Monday. It is one of the lightest machines to date and can run for up to nine hours on four ordinary AA batteries. The HP Omnibook 300 comes with Microsoft's Windows operating system, Word word-processor and Excel spreadsheet programs, and will sell for $1,950 -- about comparable to other notebooks powered by the Intel Corporation's 386 microprocessor.
6/6/1993	Profile/James Allchin; Bill Gates Has a Vision; Can This Man Deliver?	They are an elite fraternity, the programmers who create the heart and soul of computers -- the operating systems that build bridges from the intricate hardware to screens full of words and symbols that a child, or a corporate vice president, can understand. In that fraternity, James Allchin is a legend.
6/2/1993	Judge Finds Against Apple in Its Copyright Suit	Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker said today that he would grant summary judgment in favor of the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company on the last significant issue remaining in the five-year-long copyright infringement suit brought against the two companies by Apple Computer Inc. Judge Walker's formal ruling will be filed within several days. Apple, which had said last week that it would not contest the ruling, said today that it would appeal the case on grounds others than those decided in the summary judgment. Wall Street Approves Although the case could drag on through the appellate level for years, Wall Street greeted its close at the district level as a positive. Microsoft shares rose $3.625, to $96.25, in Nasdaq trading; Hewlett-Packard closed up $2.25, to $85.625, on the New York Stock Exchange, and Apple gained 37.5 cents, to $57, on the Nasdaq.
5/29/1993	No Jury Trial in Apple Suit	The jury trial scheduled for June 28 in the long-running copyright infringement suit by Apple Computer Inc. against the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company has been removed from the court calendar with the approval of the three companies. A pretrial hearing scheduled for Tuesday by Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker will still take place, and the case could still proceed to an appeal after the judge's has ruled.
5/27/1993	From Gates, a Cheer for I.B.M.	"Good news for I.B.M. shareholders, and it comes from an unlikely source -- Big Blue's sometimes nemesis William H. Gates. """"With all I.B.M.'s technical assets, which are considerable, the company should be worth twice as much as it is today,"""" said Mr. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation."
5/25/1993	Market Place; Adobe's New Acrobat Software Could Prove to Be a Winner	ADOBE SYSTEMS INC. is dramatically silencing its doubters. The creator of the software technology called Postscript, which has enabled high-quality printing in the personal computer market, recently fought off a substantial challenge from Microsoft and Apple Computer to keep its role as industry standard-setter. Now it is preparing to ship a new software technology for electronic documents that many industry experts believe will be an even bigger win than Postscript.
5/24/1993	Microsoft Soft-Pedaling Its Latest	A case of opening-night jitters pervades the sprawling corporate headquarters in Redmond, Wash., which has become the world's software capital. On the verge of introducing its most ambitious software product yet, Windows NT, the Microsoft Corporation has found itself in an unusual position: It is trying to ratchet back the expectations of the computer industry and computer users, who have come to expect blockbuster products with clockwork regularity from the world's dominant software publisher.
5/23/1993	In Pursuit of Computing's Holy Grail	"AT FIRST, the names on the conference rooms seem merely quirky: Dumbarton, York and Edinburgh. Maybe the boss got carried away after a summer vacation to Britain. But walk along the tree-lined atrium, up a flight of stairs to the larger meeting rooms, and the clues on the doors get stronger: The Gorge, The Evil Lair. The names are from Arthurian legend. And the 300 designers here from the International Business Machines Corporation, Motorola Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. who are trying to transform the computer-chip business have named their building and their make-or-break program """"Somerset"""" -- after the English county where, according to legend, the knights of the Round Table gathered at King Arthur's castle, put aside their differences and set off in pursuit of the Holy Grail. """"It seemed appropriate for what's going on here,"""" explained Bill Goins, an Apple designer."
5/22/1993	CO-FOUNDER OF MICROSOFT SELLS HUGE STAKE	Paul Allen, a co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, who said in earlier Securities and Exchange Commission filings that he might seek to buy America Online Inc., has filed to sell 1.3 million Microsoft shares since May 3, according to S.E.C. filings. Based on a Microsoft share price of about $86 during the period of filings, the transaction would be valued at about $112 million, more than enough to purchase up to 50.1 percent of America Online shares. America Online gained $4.50 yesterday , or 15.1 percent, to $34.25, in Nasdaq trading. William Savoy, president of Vulcan Northwest and a colleague of Mr. Allen, said that Mr. Allen regularly sold Microsoft shares at the end of each quarter.
5/20/1993	APPLE COMPUTER COPYRIGHT CASE IS NARROWED	A judge has further narrowed the scope of the five-year-old Apple Computer copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. Tuesday's ruling by Federal District Judge Vaughn R. Walker means that a jury will now consider only 4 of the 147 software features that Apple originally contended had been copied by Hewlett-Packard, and none of the 189 specific Microsoft features that Apple had originally challenged. The judge set a June 28 trial date for the case, which had already been substantially reduced. Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have contended that many of the contested symbols are generic or were derived from icons used earlier by other companies.
5/17/1993	Emerging Battlefronts in Software Strategy Wars; Microsoft as Arbiter Of 'Paperless Office'	"The Microsoft Corporation has quietly assembled an alliance of office-equipment makers, through which it hopes to establish a """"paperless office"""" software standard. The standard is meant to enable the creation of networks linking desktop computers, copiers, facsimile machines, printers and telephones. Microsoft, whose Windows software has become an industry standard for personal computers, wants to use Windows as the means for consolidating control of virtually every piece of electronic equipment in the modern business office."
5/17/1993	Emerging Battlefronts in Software Strategy Wars; Strong I.B.M. Move Against Microsoft	I.B.M.'s strongest challenge to the Microsoft Corporation and its dominance of the market in operating-system software for personal computers begins tomorrow. Given Microsoft's huge lead and I.B.M.'s past troubles in the personal-computer software market, there is plenty of doubt about how formidable the competition from the International Business Machines Corporation will be.
5/11/1993	Microsoft Up On Report Of I.B.M. Tie	"Shares of the Microsoft Corporation rose yesterday on a report suggesting that the big software producer and I.B.M. may cooperate more closely and a """"strong buy"""" recommendation on Microsoft from a Wall Street analyst. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that William Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, had said he would meet this month with Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the new chief executive of the International Business Machines Corporation."
5/11/1993	New Apple Chip in Challenge to Intel	Sounding a direct challenge to the Intel Corporation's chips, Apple Computer's chairman, John Sculley, predicted today that in 1994 Apple would sell more than a million of a new generation of personal computers based on a chip Apple has developed in an alliance with I.B.M. and Motorola. Mr. Sculley said the company was on schedule with development of a new generation of personal computer, to be introduced next year and based on the Power PC chip. The technology is derived from the microprocessor used in the International Business Machines Corporation's powerful RS/6000 work stations.
5/5/1993	Standard Set for Uniting Phones and Computers	The Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation said today that they had agreed upon a standard way to integrate the telephone with the personal computer. The development will find its first market in telemarketing and customer-service environments, and will later reach a broader base. Intel and Microsoft said the standard had been reviewed and supported by approximately 40 companies, including major telephone-switch manufacturers, PC and peripheral manufacturers, software developers and network providers.
5/4/1993	Bid to Acquire Online Is Weighed	Paul Allen, co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation and chairman of the Asymetrix Corporation, said today that he might seek to acquire America Online Inc., a leading supplier of information services to users of personal computers. Mr. Allen already owns 24.9 percent of America Online, which is based in Vienna, Va., and provides services like access to newspaper articles, messaging and other services over a network that PC users can access with a telephone modem.
5/4/1993	Animated Presentations For Business Occasions	CURTAIN CALL is enjoying a well-deserved encore. Version 2.0 of the presentation program, for computers running Microsoft Windows 3.0 or later, adds some nifty new features, particularly in the area of animation. Presentation programs are often employed in business for getting a point across graphically on a computer screen. The point might be how well the concern is doing or, conversely, that things are not nearly as bad as they seem. The presentation might be made to groups of employees, executives, the board of directors or stockholders; an executive might also employ such a program to push, or justify, a pet project. With Curtain Call, the presentation can be so dressed up with fancy fonts, sound, animation and the kitchen sink that restraint and dignity are called for, unless the company is itself unrestrained and undignified.
4/27/1993	TELEVISION CONVERTER BOX TO HAVE PC COMPATIBILITY	The Microsoft Corporation, the Intel Corporation and the General Instrument Corporation are planning to announce a cable television set-top converter box today that will be compatible with personal-computer standards, industry executives said. The joint venture is among the projects that reflect the computer industry's eagerness to blend the power of computers with television. The first version of the General Instrument converter box will be on the market before the end of the year. It will be priced at about $125; a card that adds personal-computer and Windows compatibility will cost an additional $200 to $300.
4/27/1993	A Mouse That Does More Tricks	THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a company better known for its software, has introduced a completely redesigned version of its best-selling computer mouse for Microsoft Windows-based personal computers. Some people may be surprised to learn that Microsoft sells $250 million worth of mice each year. Others may be surprised to learn that it is possible to spend $10 million and two years on designing a new mouse, but that is just what Microsoft did in creating its new pointing system, a company official said.
4/15/1993	Microsoft's Profit Rises 36% On a 41% Gain in Revenue	The Microsoft Corporation, the dominant company in the personal computer industry, reported yesterday that it had earned $243 million, or 80 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, an increase of 36 percent over the $179 million, or 60 cents a share, earned in the corresponding period a year earlier. The per-share earnings were near the midpoint of analysts' estimates, which ranged from 72 cents to 96 cents.
4/14/1993	Compaq and Microsoft Plan Alliance	Two powerhouses in the personal computer industry, the Compaq Computer Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation, today announced an alliance to develop innovations intended to keep their momentum going. The companies said they would work closely to develop small hand-held machines, easy-to-use technology like wireless communications, pen-based machines, and features for desktop models like compact-disk devices that many analysts regard as important growth areas.
4/6/1993	Bells, Whistles and Alternatives	THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION's new DOS 6.0 operating system software upgrade package appears to be an attractive bargain at its introductory price of $50. It includes several handy utility programs that address some of the common problems a typical PC user faces from time to time, including lack of hard disk space, the risk of viruses, the need for an easy way to make backup copies, the annoyance of out-of-memory messages and sluggish system performance. In short, DOS 6.0 is great for most PC users, especially beginners and casual users. The new utilities do their jobs well. For computer hot-rodders, though, the DOS 6.0 utilities are just training wheels. There are other utility programs on the market that work faster, offer more options or in other ways surpass their DOS counterparts.
4/4/1993	Sound Bytes; Champion of MS-DOS, Admirer of Windows	"Brad Chase is general manager for MS-DOS at the Microsoft Corporation, and thus is responsible for the development and marketing of the world's most popular personal computer operating system. Last week, Microsoft unveiled the latest version of the venerable software, MS-DOS 6.0. Mr. Chase's wife, Judy, is product manager for Microsoft Word for Windows, and thus they are one of many """"Microsoft couples,"""" although unlike most they did not meet at Microsoft. The Chases have a 2-year-old son, David, and are expecting their second child in June."
4/3/1993	New TV Battleground	The unobtrusive cable control box that sits atop many television sets is about to become a new battleground for computer, telephone and cable companies, and new alliances are emerging. Microsoft, Intel and General Instruments are expected to announce that they are jointly developing a device that combines the cable converter and a personal computer. Business Day, page 43.
4/3/1993	Battles Loom for Control Of TV's Portal to Cable	The unobtrusive cable control box that sits atop many television sets is about to become a new battleground for the nation's computer, telephone and cable television companies. The ultimate prize: control of the access to all the video entertainment and new types of electronic information that enter and leave the home. The struggle will move to a higher plateau, perhaps as early as next week, when three companies each dominant in their fields -- Microsoft, Intel and General Instruments -- are expected to announce that they are jointly developing a set-top device that combines the functions of a cable converter box and a personal computer, according to industry executives. The three companies are still working out final details of their agreement.
3/30/1993	First, the Good News About DOS.6	THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION has arranged the introduction today of DOS 6.0, the latest major revision of the most widely used personal computer operating system software. The new DOS adds a variety of new features, including data compression, that until now have been available only as add-on utilities from other companies. For people who are buying a new computer, some form of DOS 6.0 will probably come already installed on the hard disk. That makes the decision to use DOS 6.0 easy. And for most veteran PC users, the new DOS 6.0 features are an attractive bargain. Microsoft has set a price for the DOS 6.0 upgrade kit that will allow most stores to sell it for $50 or less until May 31. After that, the suggested retail price will be $129.95.
3/30/1993	I.B.M. Asked Archrival For Revamping Advice	It may be the clearest evidence yet of the humbling of Big Blue. As I.B.M. spent the last two months asking more than 100 industry executives to each propose a cure for the ailing computer giant, the company's board turned to one of I.B.M.'s archest rivals: William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation.
3/30/1993	Sun Operating System Is Aimed at PC Market	"Sun Microsystems, continuing its effort to expand beyond powerful work stations for elite computer users, today demonstrated a version of its Solaris operating system that will run the Microsoft Windows programs on mass-market personal computers. The demonstration was part of a software conference sponsored by Sun at which the company introduced versions of Solaris for I.B.M.-compatible personal computers and also said it would develop Solaris for various types of machines using the Power PC chip jointly developed by Apple Computer, International Business Machines and Motorola. Risking a Lawsuit But because Sun Microsystems Inc. has no licensing agreement with the Microsoft Corporation, Sun executives acknowledged that the company was risking a legal challenge from Microsoft by adding a Windows capability. Extremely popular among personal computer users, Windows simplifies computing tasks by allowing the user to issue commands by pointing and clicking a """"mouse"""" instead of typing arcane commands."
3/28/1993	The Executive Computer; Newest Netware Challenges Customers -- and Its Creator	NOVELL INC.'s long-awaited Netware 4.0 operating system software, which will be available in a few days, is an ambitious attempt to keep up with its customers as they move to bigger and broader networks. It is also an essential element of Novell's efforts to ward off the Microsoft Corporation's forthcoming Windows NT operating system, which is expected to be introduced later this spring.
3/24/1993	CHRONICLE	"One of the nation's most eligible bachelors is getting married. WILLIAM H. GATES, a co-founder of the computer software giant Microsoft Corporation, is planning to marry MELINDA FRENCH, a Microsoft product manager. Mr. Gates, 37, who is frequently portrayed as the nation's highest-profile computer hacker and one of the world's wealthiest entrepreneurs, has been dating Ms. French, 28, for four and a half years. They have not set a date or chosen a location for the wedding, a Microsoft spokeswoman said. She also said whether or not they would sign a prenuptial agreement was a """"private matter."
3/21/1993	The Executive Computer; The Latest Microsoft Venture? Accounting Software	"The Microsoft Corporation has introduced a Windows accounting program for small businesses that it prefers to call a business management tool. That's because """"accounting"""" is one of those words that causes many small-business owners to reach for the aspirin. But whatever its name, Microsoft Profit for Windows is a relatively painless, training-wheels accounting package for home offices and businesses with 25 or fewer employees."
3/19/1993	U.S. Companies Quietly Returning to South Africa	"The advertisement spread across two pages of a Johannesburg newspaper pictures a bottle of pharmaceutical capsules and the announcement: """"Now Legally Available."""" The product on sale is not a drug, but the Windows computer program from the Microsoft Corporation, the American producer of software that withdrew from South Africa in 1986 when an anti-apartheid boycott was gathering force. For years there was a gray market in Microsoft products, but now the company is back, with a small office and an ad campaign that transforms the long taboo into a marketing come-on."
3/17/1993	Wang Plans to Cut 3,300 Jobs by End of April	"Calling it the """"reinvention of Wang,"""" Joseph M. Tucci, president and chief executive of Wang Laboratories Inc., disclosed a plan today to reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The plan calls for eliminating more than one-third of Wang's remaining work force, a cut of 3,300 jobs, by the end of April. Ownership of Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., will be transferred to its creditors -- the largest of which include I.B.M., Microsoft, the GE Credit Corporation and Intel -- which have agreed to accept stock in the reorganized company to pay off Wang's $2 billion in unpaid claims and unsecured debt. All other creditors and stockholders will be issued new securities by the reorganized company."
3/17/1993	6 Rivals Seek to Head Off A New Microsoft Challenge	I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems and three other computer companies will announce today steps to standardize their versions of the Unix software operating system to prepare for the challenge of the Microsoft Corporation's NT system, which is expected later this year. The six companies have agreed to standards intended to give customers a desktop computing environment that will look the same for any of their customers and to allow programmers to design applications for many computers. They have also agreed to adopt common software products for linking computers in networks, and endorsed standards in the fields of graphics, multimedia and object technology.
3/16/1993	Better Late, and Better for Being Late	CENTRAL POINT SOFTWARE, late but great, has introduced a version of its popular PC Tools utilities for computers that use Microsoft Windows. PC Tools for Windows does all the expected housekeeping chores, including tidying up the hard disk, straightening out the file cabinets and disinfecting the files of viruses. But it also makes Windows a bit easier, a bit faster and a lot more convenient to use.
2/28/1993	Sound Bytes; Hedging Bets in a World of Open Systems	TEN years ago, Casey Powell led a band of 17 defectors from the Intel Corporation to found Sequent Computer Systems Inc. in Beaverton, Ore. Sequent was an early proponent of open systems (the use of processors, software and peripherals that are not dependent on one company's technology) and of multiprocessing (the linkage of many small microprocessors to handle complex tasks at higher speed and lower costs than large computers). As such, Sequent has always been a leading proponent of Unix, the operating system developed by A.T.& T. that is synonymous with open systems. Recently, however, Sequent announced that it would support Windows NT, the new operating system from the Microsoft Corporation, and that it would produce special hardware for NT. Although Mr. Powell would rather talk about fast cars, fine wine or his children, he consented to discuss this step.
2/25/1993	Microsoft Trademark Setback	"In a case that echoes earlier fights over terms like """"Light Beer"""" and """"the Pill,"""" the Federal Government has issued a preliminary decision denying the Microsoft Corporation a trademark for the word """"Windows"""" on its hugely successful computer program by that name. If it is upheld, the decision by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which Microsoft will appeal, would be a big blow to the software giant. Microsoft dominates the market for programs that provide the basic instructions on I.B.M.-compatible personal computers."
2/9/1993	Microsoft's Stock Takes a Tumble	Sometimes no news is not good news. Shares of the Microsoft Corporation fell today in heavy trading after the Federal Trade Commission said on Friday that it was not yet taking action in its long-running investigation of the company's business practices. Wary analysts said the F.T.C.'s announcement before the stock market close on Friday, which did not even mention Microsoft by name, did not rule out future actions against the software giant.
2/6/1993	F.T.C. Takes No Action On Microsoft	"After meeting behind closed doors all morning, the Federal Trade Commission refrained today from taking disciplinary action against the Microsoft Corporation, which had been accused of unfair competition in the market for personal computer software, where it dominates. But the agency indicated that Microsoft was not yet off the hook. In an oblique announcement that did not even mention the company by name, the agency said it had not reached a """"final decision"""" but would """"reconvene in the near future."
1/15/1993	Record Sales For Microsoft And Apple	Apple Computer Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation, two of the computer industry's hottest rivals, today announced record revenues for their first and second quarters, respectively. But neither company was able to show the earnings strength that sent technology stocks up on Wednesday in the wake of the Intel Corporation's strong fourth-quarter report.
1/10/1993	The Executive Computer; Where Giants Tread: A New Biography of Microsoft's Chief	"William H. Gates is one of the busiest executives in the world, people who work for him say, yet he still finds time to read books. If he can do it, so can anyone. An appropriate one to start with is """"Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry and Made Himself the Richest Man in America,"""" by Stephen Manes and Paul Andrews ($25, Doubleday). It is not the first biography of Mr. Gates, co-founder and chairman of the Microsoft Corporation and, as everyone seems compelled to add, the richest man in America. Given that Mr. Gates is but 37 years old, there will surely be many other attempts. But this book, written by a veteran computer industry columnist and a reporter for The Seattle Times, is to date the definitive work."
1/6/1993	Microsoft Names Apple Official for a Data Base Business	The Microsoft Corporation tapped a top software executive at Apple Computer Inc. today to head up its data base applications business. Roger Heinen Jr., who has been Apple's senior vice president and general manager of the Macintosh software architecture division, takes the new post of vice president of Microsoft's data base and development tools division, effective Feb. 1.
12/20/1992	Wall Street; After I.B.M.'s Fall -- Microsoft?	For some portfolios, it will mean a slight dent. For others, it will look more like a crater. One way or another, though, the big bust of Big Blue means that other publicly traded companies must emerge to replace I.B.M. as the core holding of choice -- the stock you put away, cross your fingers and forget about. Until the up-and-comer gets too big, too klutzy and too widely copied, of course. But what about now? Last week's news that the International Business Machines Corporation would slash an additional 25,000 jobs helped knock $10.875 off the stock, which closed at $51.50 on Friday. The decline was abrupt, but hardly countertrend, for I.B.M. Friday's close was down 49 percent from this year's high of $100.25 on July 16, and a 71 percent tumble from its all-time high of $175.875 in 1987.
12/14/1992	Market Place; Software Business Is Turning Tough	"CAN anyone besides the Microsoft Corporation make money in software anymore? That was one plaintive question raised at the Technologic Partners' Personal Computer Outlook conference held here last week. As if in answer, Borland International Inc. announced on Wednesday that it would lay off 15 percent of its workers and take a $35 million charge for the quarter; it blamed a price war started by Microsoft. """"In 1993, we better be lean and mean and aggressive or everybody will disappear except Microsoft,"""" Philippe Kahn, Borland's chief executive, said."
12/9/1992	A Computer Industry Popularity Poll	Technology professionals surveyed by Computerworld have listed the International Business Machines Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, in that order, as the companies in the industry they most admire. Apple Computer Inc. and the Compaq Computer Corporation finished fourth and fifth.
12/6/1992	When Research Is No Longer the Ugly Duckling	BUILDING 9, on the 265-acre Microsoft campus here, is virtually indistinguishable from its 23 sister structures. But whereas in the other buildings, people are working on products they hope will be on store shelves soon, Building 9 is home to a growing band of scientists dreaming about the 21st century. Karen Jensen, for one, would like to build the first computer system that can understand any message it encounters -- be it in English or Urdu -- and respond accordingly. Charles Simonyi hopes to give programmers ways to annotate the code they write so that others can follow their tricks and speed the process of developing software.
11/25/1992	Softer Analysis On Microsoft	Rick Sherlund, the Goldman, Sachs & Company analyst whose lower earnings estimate for the Microsoft Corporation knocked about $1.77 billion off the company's stock market value on Monday, published further comments, saying his reductions may have been too severe. Mr. Sherlund has not returned phone calls seeking elaboration on his written remarks. Nor have Microsoft officials commented.
11/24/1992	Shares Drop At Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation's market value plunged about $1.77 billion yesterday after an analyst slashed his earnings estimates for the software publisher. Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, predicted Microsoft would cut European software prices as part of its continuing rivalry with the Lotus Development Corporation.
11/19/1992	OPPENHEIMER DROPS BUY RECOMMENDATION ON BORLAND	"Elliot Prince, an Oppenheimer & Company analyst, dropped a """"buy"""" recommendation on Borland International Inc. on concerns about a price war in data bases with the Microsoft Corporation. Mr. Prince, who now rates Borland """"market performer,"""" cut his earnings estimates for Borland, to $1.10 a share from $1.50 a share for the year ending March 1993, and to $1.90 from $2.50 for the 1994 fiscal year. On Monday, Microsoft released Access for Windows, its first data base program, and said it would charge about $200 less a copy for Access than what competitors have charged. Borland, which has dominated the data base market with Paradox and dBase, signaled it was willing to meet Microsoft's prices. """"Even if Borland wins"""" the data base battle, it is """"winning at lower price points,"""" the analyst said."
11/17/1992	A Soldier in the Data Base Wars	THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION introduced its long-awaited Access data base management program here yesterday, filling one of the last major gaps in the software giant's product line. In a bold attempt to pre-empt its probable main rival (the Windows version of Borland International Inc.'s popular Paradox program, now not expected until early next year) Microsoft will sell Access for $99 until Jan. 31, 1993, when the full suggested list price of $495 will take effect. As a relative newcomer to the data base arena, Microsoft is essentially giving away Access in order to gain a share of the market now in the possession of Borland's Paradox and other more expensive data base programs, like Oracle.
11/17/1992	Microsoft and Software's Slow Pace	The slow pace of software design has become a big stumbling block in the personal computer business. The Microsoft Corporation underscored this problem today when it introduced its first internally developed personal computer data base program at the Comdex computer trade show here. The giant software publisher acknowledged that it had taken a wrong turn that cost it $20 million and three years before finding the path to its first home-grown commercial data base package.
11/10/1992	COMPANY NEWS: A Microsoft-Intel Production; PC Motion Pictures Via Windows Software	Coming soon to an I.B.M.-compatible personal computer near you: digital video. On Tuesday, the Microsoft Corporation will announce Video for Windows, which is based on the Intel Corporation's new Indeo digital video technology and allows computer users to integrate full-motion video in programs that run on Microsoft's Windows operating system. Priced at $199, Video for Windows will be available immediately.
10/28/1992	Market Place; Microsoft Looks To Headier Future	MICROSOFT, the nation's largest software publisher, has been on a roll recently. In the last 12 months, its stock has shot up 50 percent, making William H. Gates, the chairman who holds more than a third of the company's stock, the nation's richest man. Microsoft's first quarter, which ended in September, was a spectacular one, with earnings of $209 million , or 70 cents a share, on record revenues of $818 million. Full-year earnings per share are expected to top $3 in 1993, up from $2.41 this year.
10/14/1992	Microsoft Net Rose 45.1% in First Quarter	The Microsoft Corporation reported first-quarter revenues and earnings today that exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates. For the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, Microsoft had earnings of $209 million, or 70 cents a share, up 45.1 percent from $144 million, or 50 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues rose 41 percent, to $818 million, from $581 million in the first quarter of the 1992 fiscal year.
10/13/1992	MICROSOFT TO OPEN FOUR UNITS IN EASTERN EUROPE	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would be the first software company to open wholly owned subsidiaries in four Eastern European nations. Four of Microsoft's best-selling programs will be translated into Russian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian through these new units by the second quarter of 1993, the company said.
10/4/1992	The Executive Computer; So the Computer Talks. Does Anyone Want to Listen?	The Apple Macintosh, Commodore Amiga, Atari and Next computers have had built-in sound abilities for years, but is anyone listening in corporate America? To most executives, computer sound consists of beeps and whirs and the occasional grinding sound of a dying disk drive. Audio, it is widely believed in the business world, is important mainly in games and entertainment software.
10/2/1992	Corrections	A report by Bloomberg Business News in the Company News column of Business Day on Saturday about Microsoft's Windows NT operating system described the origin of the system incorrectly. It was developed solely by Microsoft; it is not based on Unix.
9/26/1992	MICROSOFT WILL NOT SHIP WINDOWS NT UNTIL EARLY '93	The Microsoft Corporation will not begin shipping Windows NT until at least early 1993, a Microsoft spokeswoman said yesterday. The Redmond, Wash., software giant set a goal of shipping the new operating system by December 1992, but that target will not be met because corporate testing of the software will not begin until mid-October. Windows NT is a Unix-based software system with networking and work station capabilities, and was developed with Digital Equipment Systems and Fox Software Inc., a maker of Unix software. Microsoft acquired Fox for $190 million in March.
9/22/1992	Rivals Angry and Awed In Microsoft's Shadow	"Three top computer industry executives publicly attacked the Microsoft Corporation's business practices at an industry conference that began here today, but their challenges to the industry's most influential competitor were tinged with awe as well as anger. """"They're big and powerful, but what is more important is that they're smart,"""" Philippe Kahn, chief executive of Borland International, said in a speech. Borland is a software publisher that competes directly against Microsoft in markets for spreadsheets and computer languages."
8/11/1992	Life Preservers for Windows Users	BY the end of this year, according to the Microsoft Corporation, more than half of all new personal computers will come with DOS-Windows already installed as the primary operating system. Microsoft officials say Windows is selling at a rate of more than a million copies a month. That's a lot of Windows. And if my experiences are any indication, a lot of people are probably glassy-eyed from trying to figure out how to install and configure and customize Windows to meet their needs.
8/2/1992	The Executive Computer; The Database Marketplace Heats Up	A fierce contest is imminent in the software category of databases for Windows. The Microsoft Corporation is putting the finishing trim on a program called Access, the company's first home-grown database product. And Borland International Inc., which has shown enormous gusto for taking on Microsoft, is fine-tuning Paradox for Windows. Access and Paradox for Windows are likely to emerge as the new standards for advanced business database software, although neither will be available until later this year.
7/23/1992	Three in Computer Industry Post Gains; One Has Loss	Three companies in the computer industry yesterday reported strong gains for the latest quarter. Microsoft, Computer Associates International Inc. and the Amdahl Corporation all reported higher income. In contrast, the Data General Corporation reported a loss. Following are the details of the companies' results: Microsoft The Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest independent software company, reported a 52.2 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings.
7/16/1992	Armistice for Apple and Microsoft	Is nothing sacred in the computer world? For years, Apple and Microsoft have been at odds with each other, battling -- sometimes bitterly -- in forums ranging from the marketplace to the courtroom. In the last month, for example, an Apple advertising campaign has lambasted Microsoft's Windows program as being inferior to Macintosh software.
7/12/1992	Making a Difference; Mr. Cutler's Gift to PC Users	When David Cutler left the Digital Equipment Corporation in 1988, he was expected to start his own company, and the venture capitalists were there waiting for him. Mr. Cutler was best known as the chief architect of VMS, the operating system software for Digital's phenomenally successful minicomputer. But instead, Mr. Cutler accepted a position at the Microsoft Corporation, where he was assigned to create an entirely new operating system. (Operating systems control the basic flow of data between the processor and the disk in a computer, or between multiple computers on a network.) Last week, more than 4,000 independent software developers crowded into the Moscone Center here to see the fruits of Mr. Cutler's labor, now known as Windows NT.
7/12/1992	Three Cheers for Microsoft's Millionaires . . .	"To the Editor: What? You can get rich by being hardworking, unassuming and brainy? (""""Microsoft's Unlikely Millionaires,"""" June 28.) And you can still make it by dreaming about things loftier than your portfolio? Hopefully, the Microsoft millionaires are a portent of things to come in the business world, rather than an aberration. I, for one, could not wait for the """"geniuses"""" of the 1980's to be exposed as the bluff artists and posturing schemers many of them were."
7/12/1992	Three Cheers for Microsoft's Millionaires . . . As Opposed to the I.B.M. Experience	"To the Editor: """"Microsoft's Unlikely Millionaires"""" stands in unhappy contrast to the I.B.M. experience. An employee at the International Business Machines Corporation who owned $10,000 worth of stock of 1974 vintage would have seen it grow to about $19,000 at the recent market price of $98 a share. True, he or she would have received approximately $12,500 in dividends in the meantime. But analysis shows that 1974 would have been the """"best year"""" in the last 18 to have made such an investment."
7/7/1992	MICROSOFT SHOWS WINDOWS NT OPERATING SYSTEM	An overflow crowd of over 4,000 independent software developers gathered at the Moscone Center in San Francisco as the Microsoft Corporation displayed its Windows NT operating system. The developers' version of Windows NT is available immediately for $69 in compact disk form, or $399 with printed documentation. The finished product is scheduled for release by the end of the year.
6/30/1992	Of Gaps and How to Bridge Them	THE personal computer industry is diverging and converging at the same time. An example of divergence is the split between International Business Machines and Microsoft on operating systems. An example of convergence is the alliance forged between I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. A smaller instance of convergence is that Claris, the software subsidiary of Apple, is introducing programs for Microsoft's Windows. One strength of Windows is that it makes a P.C. almost as easy to use as a Macintosh, and Claris has been making Macintosh software since 1987. I am writing this with the word-processing component of ClarisWorks, I keep my address book in the database module and, one of these days when we get organized around here, I will put my income-outgo information in its spreadsheet.
6/28/1992	Microsoft's Unlikely Millionaires	Just a few years ago, when the monied class of this city gathered inside a single ballroom for an annual arts benefit, nary an unfamiliar face could be seen. Families named Boeing, Nordstrom and Weyerhaeuser, representing airplane, clothing-store and timber empires, were the financial powers of this corner of the Far West. They were also benevolent civic players, keeping the arts afloat and leading drives to save a sports team or add a wing to a hospital. But virtually overnight, the pecking order of wealth in the Pacific Northwest has been turned upside down. The reason: The stunning success of the Microsoft Corporation, the company that William H. Gates 3d brought back to his hometown little more than a decade ago.
6/28/1992	I.B.M. and Microsoft Settle Operating-System Feud	The world's largest computer maker, I.B.M., and the most influential software company, Microsoft, have settled a noisy rift by agreeing to pursue divergent paths without legal and financial squabbling. Both people who write software and people who buy it, for their own use or for their companies, have been afraid of committing themselves to either I.B.M.'s or Microsoft's new generations of operating systems. Many industry executives believe that the fear has slowed sales for several years as customers put off choosing a system that could be endangered if the legal wrangling continued.
6/16/1992	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Apple Finds a New Arena For Its Fight With Microsoft	"After four years of battling the Microsoft Corporation and its Windows software in the courts, Apple Computer Inc. took the fight to a new arena last week with an advertising campaign that questions its rival's contention that the software is easy to use. Windows is a """"shell"""" program that runs on top of Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system software to give it an appearance and """"user friendliness"""" similar to Apple's Macintosh. With either system, users execute commands and create files by selecting graphical icons with a mouse pointing device. Both present what has come to be known as a graphical user interface."
6/14/1992	Chasing Bugs in the Electronic Village	I COULDN'T WAIT TO BUY MICROSOFT WORD for Windows -- rumored to be the new Cuisinart, Mack truck and Swiss Army knife of word-processing software, full-featured, powerful and, for a writer, the ultimate time-saving device. I was writing a long book, and I wanted the best. One day in January 1990, I finally got to tear open a software box bigger than some computers, and out it came. The world's pre-eminent software manufacturer had spent roughly as long developing this word processor as the Manhattan Project had spent cooking up the atomic bomb, but secrecy had not been quite as airtight. For more than a year, Microsoft had been leaking juicy tidbits to its waiting army of trade journalists, computer consultants and corporate purchasers. Word for Windows (a.k.a. Winword or WfW) would be Wysiwyg (the standard acronym for What You See Is What You Get) -- that is, it would display page layouts and typefaces with high fidelity to the final printed product. It would let users work with nine documents on the screen at once. It would have a macro language -- a way to spend hours writing mini-programs to streamline all those little chores that can suck up milliseconds of a writer's time.
6/14/1992	The Executive Computer; Not Ready for Windows or OS/2? Here Are Training Wheels	Windows is wildly popular and OS/2 is technically impressive, but Norton Desktop for DOS may turn out to be the most important new software of the year for the average PC user. Norton Desktop for DOS allows owners of older machines to reap many of the ease-of-use advantages of Microsoft Windows without having to spend lots of money on more powerful hardware and software.
6/7/1992	The Executive Computer; Three Different Ways to Dress Up Windows	Microsoft Windows 3.1 is often referred to as an operating system, and in some ways it is. It has its own command conventions, and it puts its own special demands on both the hardware and the software used with it, just as other operating systems do. Technically, though, Windows is just a facade, albeit a fancy one, for DOS, which remains the true, underlying operating system. Just as Windows changes the face of DOS, making the computer easier to use, several programs are available that change the face of Windows and make it easier to use: Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0, New Wave 4.0 and Rooms for Windows. Each has its own strengths to match the different personal working styles of executives.
5/28/1992	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the rivalry between the Microsoft Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation misstated the amount of money invested by Microsoft in developing an operating system intended to make it a force in commercial computing and in the work station business. It is $40 million, not $400 million.
5/26/1992	Computer Feud Enters a New Phase	Once best friends, now quarrelsome enemies, Microsoft, the nation's largest software company, and I.B.M., the largest computer company, are edging toward a much wider war. The battlefield is the heart of the International Business Machines Corporation's market: the data-processing centers of Corporate America. The Microsoft Corporation, which dominates the personal computer business, has invested $400 million and spent five years developing an operating system -- the software that controls computer operations -- that may make it a force in commercial computing and the fast-growing work station business.
5/15/1992	MICROSOFT WIDENS USE OF OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE	The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it would offer its operating system programs in an integrated package of Microsoft Windows version 3.1 with MS-DOS version 5 specifically for I.B.M.'s PS/2 computers. Microsoft's announcement comes after the International Business Machines Corporation said that it would bundle its own operating system, OS/2, with certain PS/2 models that have traditionally used MS-DOS, with or without Windows.
5/13/1992	Apple Ruling Reconsidered	A district court judge agreed today to reconsider his April 14 ruling throwing out most of Apple Computer Inc.'s long-running copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. Judge Vaughn Walker gave lawyers for Hewlett-Packard 20 days to file briefs in response to Apple's request for reconsideration. But the judge again chastised Apple for being late in its filings and for ignoring, until the last minute, his requests for an item-by-item account of the way the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company's products infringe Apple's copyrights.
5/10/1992	Microsoft Nails Some Pirates	"When the Microsoft Corporation unveiled its updated MS-DOS 5 software operating system last June, it was confident that it had devised a way to thwart the loss of $1 billion a year from software piracy. Its packaging contains two one-of-a-kind holograms, one a circular image on the package box and the other a rectangular image pasted inside on the product manual, viewable through a window on the box. The multidimensional images bear the company's name or the MS-DOS logo and tell consumers that the product is the real McCoy. Microsoft pamphlets said the holograms are """"virtually impossible"""" to reproduce and """"raise the counterfeiting barrier to a level previously unattempted in the software industry."""" Yet within two weeks of the introduction, a Taiwanese counterfeiter commissioned a holographer in China to copy and produce the holograms. Over the next half-dozen months, Microsoft's counterattack took it to Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong and Melbourne. The idea was to track down the counterfeiters, mostly without the aid of foreign governments. Ultimately, the company helped bust a major Asian couterfeiting ring that may have produced up to $150 million worth of the company's hottest products."
4/23/1992	New Microsoft-Digital Accords Expected	The Microsoft Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation will announce a series of agreements tomorrow aimed at strengthening their cooperation in computer hardware and software, including operating systems, software applications and electronic mail. Microsoft will confirm that it is developing a version of its new NT operating system for Digital Equipment's Alpha microprocessor, an industry executive familiar with the deal said. Microsoft will also announce that it plans to create versions of its most popular applications programs to run on the Alpha chip at some unspecified time. Finally, the two companies will cooperate on Microsoft's electronic mail standard, making it compatible with Digital's network computer systems.
4/21/1992	Books Catch Up With New Windows	"JUDGING from a recent weekday visit to the local software shop, the Microsoft Windows bandwagon is really rolling along. It seemed that just about all of the dozen or so customers (it isn't a big store) were upgrading to version 3.1. Of course, this gave the salesclerks an unparalleled opportunity to sell programs that work with Windows and books about 3.1. The first two books on 3.1 to land on this desk are both from Microsoft Press, the publishing arm of the Microsoft Corporation. """"Concise Guide to Microsoft Windows 3.1,"""" by Kris Jamsa ($12.95), truly is concise. In 195 pages, including appendixes and index, Mr. Jamsa covers everything from how to start Windows in the first place, through the much-improved File Manager module, and even descriptions of two games played under Windows, Solitaire and Minesweeper."
4/17/1992	Microsoft Profits Up 44.4% On Sales to Manufacturers	The Microsoft Corporation today reported increased revenues and earnings for its third fiscal quarter, which ended March 31. It attributed the gains to strong sales through so-called original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.'s, which resell its software with their hardware products. For the quarter, Microsoft had earnings of $178.8 million, or 90 cents a share, up 44.4 percent from $123.8 million, or 65 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago.
4/16/1992	Ruling on Apple May Ease Development of Software	With most of Apple Computer's arguments in the company's four-year-old copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard tossed out by a Federal judge on Tuesday, many industry analysts said today that a freer operating environment could ensue for software developers. Still, they cautioned that the decision was an oral ruling by a lower court. Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker could offer different details in his final written ruling, or an appellate court could overturn it. Indeed, Apple Computer Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif., said it would proceed with its case.
4/15/1992	Most of Apple's Copyright Suit Is Dismissed	Apple Computer's long-running copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard was gutted today when Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker threw out its central elements in a surprise ruling. A few remaining items will be discussed at a hearing scheduled for May 12.
4/14/1992	Microsoft Smooths Some Bumps	DEPENDING on which side of the debate you favor, Microsoft Windows is either the best thing to happen to DOS computers since the first PC was introduced or the biggest case of hysterical consumerism since the tulip bulb mania in 17th-century Holland. The truth lies somewhere in between, of course. Windows has been around for many years, but it did not capture the imaginations of users until version 3.0 arrived nearly two years ago. Since then, the Microsoft Corporation has sold more than 10 million copies of Windows 3.0, and it expects to match that figure this year with the newest upgrade, Windows 3.1.
4/8/1992	Pen Software By Microsoft	"The Microsoft Corporation said today that its pen-based operating system software, Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, was available. Also known as Windows for Pens, Microsoft's product was introduced before that of the Go Corporation, which will announce the availability of its rival software, Penpoint, on April 16. """"To make personal computing even more personal and broadly accessible, the interaction between the individual and the computer must become less obtrusive and more natural,"""" Mike Maples, Microsoft's executive vice president for the worldwide products group, said in a statement."
4/7/1992	The New Soul of the Machine	WHEN the major planets fall into alignment in the heavens, soothsayers prophesy upheaval and chaos. So beware the Ides of April. A similar portentous alignment is occurring this month in the personal computer industry as several major companies introduce new or improved operating system software. Operating system software is the foundation software upon which all other computer applications operate. It is, in an anthropomorphic sense, the soul or DNA of the machine. The most popular operating system is DOS, used by an estimated 70 million computers. DOS is more than 10 years old, well beyond retirement age when measured in computer years, and several newer operating systems are maneuvering to replace it.
4/5/1992	The Executive Computer; Where Does the 600-Pound Gorilla Write Data Bases?	"The Microsoft Corporation has grown to be a billion-dollar company without any significant success in the data-base market. That could change suddenly now that this largest and most fearsome of software companies has proposed to acquire Fox Software Inc., maker of the highly regarded Foxpro data base manager for DOS, Macintosh and Unix computers. Foxpro is a fast and flashy """"clone"""" of dBASE, the most popular data base management program among business users. Businesses use data base programs to store and retrieve information from employee records to sales reports to customer lists. More important, they use dBASE and Foxpro as a programming language to develop custom business applications. American companies have invested literally billions of dollars in developing dBASE applications for their data since dBASE appeared in 1981."
3/31/1992	An Unlikely Underdog; I.B.M. Must Play Catch-Up With Microsoft As It Begins to Ship Improved Software	I.B.M. finds itself in a remarkable position -- the underdog -- as it begins shipping the first copies today of a revamped and spruced-up version of its OS/2 operating system software for personal computers. As recently as two years ago, before its bitter split with the Microsoft Corporation, such a turn of events would have been unthinkable. The industry has historically viewed I.B.M. as routinely entering markets late, and then quickly dominating them through sheer size and marketing prowess.
3/30/1992	Wordperfect Executive Is Forced Out	The executive in charge of day-to-day operations at the Wordperfect Corporation, which makes the nation's best-selling word processing software, has been forced to resign. Some industry analysts suggest that W. E. (Pete) Peterson, who had been Wordperfect's executive vice president, is the first victim of the company's bruising battle to fend off an increasingly popular word processing package from the Microsoft Corporation.
3/25/1992	Microsoft to Try New Market By Acquiring Fox Software	Moving into the one big area of the personal computer software business in which it does not participate, the Microsoft Corporation said today that it would buy Fox Software Inc., a provider of data base software, which is used to store and retrieve information. Microsoft will exchange 1.36 million of its shares, worth more than $170 million, making this by far the largest acquisition the company has ever made. It will also set up another direct confrontation between Microsoft and Borland International, which dominates the personal computer data base market by virtue of its acquisition last year of Ashton-Tate, maker of the popular dBase package.
3/23/1992	Apple Printer For Windows	In a foray into enemy territory, Apple Computer Inc. will introduce on Monday a laser printer and a scanner tailored for computers using the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system for I.B.M.-compatible equipment. The products represent efforts by Apple to increase its revenues by spreading its technology beyond users of its Macintosh computers. Apple has recently begun making some software available for computers other than the Macintosh.
3/20/1992	Apple's New Damage Claim	The Microsoft Corporation said today that Apple Computer Inc. had increased the amount it is seeking in damages in its long-running copyright infringement suit. The new amount, $5.55 billion, up from a previous claim of $4.37 billion, is subject to further adjustment during the course of the suit, and can be awarded only if there is a finding of infringement.
3/13/1992	Sun Link Is Sought By I.B.M.	I.B.M. has quietly invited the world's leading maker of computer work stations, Sun Microsystems Inc., to join an alliance that aims to set the course of the desktop computer industry. The International Business Machines Corporation, the world's largest computer maker, asked Sun in February to join Taligent, the joint venture it formed last year with Apple Computer Inc., the second-largest maker of personal computers.
3/8/1992	The Executive Computer; Apple-I.B.M. Venture, With New Leaders, Searches for a Soul	Taligent Inc. officially opened for business last week with 170 experienced employees, two new leaders, the most impressive venture backing in Silicon Valley and one of the toughest challenges faced by any computer software company. Taligent is an independent joint venture of Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation, with a mandate to develop operating system software that will be the foundation for business computers in the mid-1990's and into the 21st century.
2/28/1992	Software Detente For I.B.M.	I.B.M. has quietly retreated from its loudly announced plan to battle the Microsoft Corporation for leadership of the personal computer software industry. The decision by I.B.M. to avoid thrusting its OS/2 program into direct competition with Microsoft's Windows means that Microsoft can count on the continuing allegiance of hundreds of computer makers and software publishers, and millions of users.
2/12/1992	Microsoft Discloses Apple Claim	The Microsoft Corporation today disclosed that Apple Computer Inc. was seeking $4.37 billion in damages in its long-running copyright infringment suit against the software company. Apple sued Microsoft and the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1989, contending that Microsoft's Windows 2.03 and Hewlett-Packard's New Wave programs copied the look and feel of the Macintosh's visual displays. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., later amended its suit to include Windows 3.0, the version currently marketed by Microsoft.
2/4/1992	Microsoft President Is Dismissed	"William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation and the world's wealthiest computer programmer, said yesterday that he was dismissing Michael R. Hallman, the president he selected two years ago. Mr. Gates, a brilliant and demanding boss known for bombarding employees with electronic mail at all hours of the night, bluntly said that Mr. Hallman just did not measure up. """"He was doing a lot of the parts of the job well,"""" Mr. Gates said in a telephone interview yesterday. """"But as we were thinking through new strategy, I wasn't satisfied that he was the right person for the job."
1/27/1992	First TV Spots For Microsoft	"The Microsoft Corporation will become a television advertiser for the first time, spending $8 million to run commercials from mid-March through May for its Windows computer software. """"I call it 'printcast,' """" said Gary Gigot, Microsoft's vice president of marketing, """"taking the principles that have been successful in selling our product in print and using them in the television medium."""" The seven commercials, like Microsoft's print advertisements, are being created by Ogilvy & Mather Los Angeles."
1/21/1992	New Microsoft-Intel System	The Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation announced a software system today that they said would extend the battery life of portable computers. The approach, which the companies hope will become a standard for computers based on Intel microprocessors, allows parts of a computer that are not immediately needed to be shut off, preserving power.
12/8/1991	The Executive Computer; Windows Word Processors Do Battle	Three of the biggest personal computer software companies -- Microsoft, Lotus and Wordperfect -- are using everything short of sticks and stones in a battle for supremacy in the category of word processing for Windows. Wordperfect is the most popular word processing software for DOS-based personal computers, but that does not guarantee it primacy under a different operating system.
11/1/1991	Borland's Stock Soars At Lotus's Expense	Rave reviews for several new software products being developed by Borland International caused fireworks in the stock market yesterday. When the smoke cleared, the price of Borland's shares was up nearly 17 percent, while the shares of its rival, Lotus Development, fell almost 12 percent. The new Borland products, all intended for use with the popular Windows software program from the Microsoft Corporation, were demonstrated at Borland International Inc.'s headquarters in Scott's Valley, Calif., on Wednesday night. The audience: analysts attending the American Electonics Association meeting held in nearby Monterey.
10/15/1991	Software's Giants to Square Off	Early next year, I.B.M. and the Microsoft Corporation, the two giants of personal computing, will go head to head in their first direct confrontation. It is a contest that may well determine the shape of the computer industry. It is a crucial battle that will pit I.B.M.'s ability to produce a next-generation, more powerful software system against Microsoft's pervasive influence in the world of personal computers. While the International Business Machines Corporation conceded last week that its operating system would be delayed a few months while new features were hurriedly added, it still insisted that it would be delivered in a timely fashion, probably next March.
10/13/1991	The Executive Computer; The Brave New World of I.B.M. and Apple	The contract was a foot thick, which gives some idea of the complexity of the deal signed earlier this month by Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation. Reduced to essentials, Apple and I.B.M. have agreed that they must join forces if they are to salvage any meaningful role in the personal computer industry of the 21st century. The two biggest PC makers vowed to work together to develop a generation of powerful business computers and an operating system for those computers. They hope to be done by the mid-1990's, meaning it will be years before the main results of the alliance are evident -- if the effort does not collapse under its own weight before then.
10/12/1991	I.B.M. Will Delay an Anticipated Product	I.B.M. disclosed yesterday that it would not meet its end-of-the-year goal for shipping a new version of its advanced personal computer operating system. It has been counting on the system to blunt the growing influence of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows program. The setback, which the International Business Machines Corporation said had resulted from customers' concerns that arose in a product-testing program, is likely to hurt the company's credibility as it struggles to regain its authority in an increasingly bitter marketing war with its former partner.
10/11/1991	Profits Rise At Microsoft And at Intel	The Intel Corporation, the leading supplier of microprocessors for personal computers, said today that its earnings for the third quarter of 1991 rose 17 percent from a year ago but were down from the second quarter, because of sluggish demand for some microprocessors and other products. The earnings were better than expected, and Intel's stock rose $3.50 today, to $42, in over-the-counter trading. Last month, when Intel said it expected disappointing earnings, its stock fell $6.75 in one day, to $43, and has not traded above that level since.
9/24/1991	Flexibility Without Complexity	THE Microsoft Corporation has come up with three new Windows products for people who have powerful personal computers, but who do not need all the power of conventional Windows business software. It sounds like a narrow field, but it really is not. Computer prices are coming down as fast as computer technology is advancing, with the result that many beginning computer users today are starting out with machines that have the minimum requirements to run Windows software: a 386SX microprocessor, a few megabytes of system memory and at least 40 megabytes of hard disk drive storage. Such a computer system, equipped with a color VGA monitor, keyboard and the usual accessories, can easily be found for less than $2,000.
9/24/1991	Hewlett Accord With Microsoft	The Hewlett-Packard Company and the Microsoft Corporation said they would work together to insure compatibility of advanced software that each is developing. Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., has been promoting New Wave, a program that allows different software programs to work together. It competes in some ways with Object Linking and Embedding, a program that Microsoft is including in its Windows software.
9/24/1991	Time Management in a New Environment	ONE sign that Windows 3.0, Microsoft's graphical program for making DOS-based computers almost as easy to use as Macintoshes, is here to stay is that smaller software publishers are migrating to it. If it takes the big programs -- like Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect -- to validate a new computing environment, it takes the smaller programs to make it livable. A new house needs more than a stove and refrigerator; it also needs towels and coffee cups. OnTime, a time-management program from Campbell Services of Southfield, Mich., was a fine piece of work as a DOS program, discussed here last year. The new Windows version is little short of sensational.
9/22/1991	MR. SOFTWARE	"As a technical writer who has experienced the rise and fall of software companies from the trenches, I have nothing but praise for the work of the Microsoft Corporation (""""Mr. Software,"""" by Fred Moody, Aug. 25). It produces innovative, relatively bug-free products for a reasonable price. I'm using one of them now to write this letter. As for Bill Gates and all the sour grapes about his billions -- compared with the likes of Michael Milken, he's some kind of American hero. Just think, you can still get wealthy in America by making something! LISA BOYER Greensboro, N.C."
9/22/1991	MR. SOFTWARE	Fred Moody's article on Bill Gates captures the real spirit of the man and his machine. It is equal parts technological sophistication, competitive spirit and burning enthusiasm. No wonder Gates has succeeded and continues to succeed. He has discovered a model for post-industrial leadership and management that is a winner in a highly competitive global market. How unfortunate that he is seen as a figure to be attacked rather than emulated. DANA PECK Portland, Ore.
9/17/1991	A Simplified Package for Novices	THE Microsoft Corporation, reaching out to novice computer users, introduced three new software products yesterday aimed at home computer users and those who work in small businesses and home offices. They are Microsoft Works for Windows, Microsoft Money and Microsoft Publisher. All are based on Microsoft's Windows 3.0 graphical operating system, which means that while the programs are intended for novices, the novices must have computers with enough memory and processing power to run Windows. Windows must be purchased separately.
9/16/1991	New Software By Microsoft	Making a bid for the home- and small-business market, the Microsoft Corporation is scheduled to announce three new low-priced software programs today. The programs -- Microsoft Works for Windows, Microsoft Money and Microsoft Publisher -- run under Microsoft's Windows operating system version 3.0, which gives I.B.M.- compatible personal computers much of the ease of use of Apple Computer's Macintosh. They are intended for new computer users who do not need the power of Microsoft's larger programs.
9/15/1991	Where Electronics and Art Converge	"Alan Rath's workshop in an Oakland warehouse looks like a television repair shop. Video tubes are strewn about and spools of colored wire of various sizes hang from racks on the wall. But Mr. Rath is actually a sculptor whose works have been displayed in museums and galleries. He fashions his works from silicon chips and video tubes, often scavenged from the surplus stores of nearby Silicon Valley. """"Clock II,"""" for instance, consists of three video screens that display brightly colored hands counting out the hours, minutes and seconds."
9/15/1991	MR. SOFTWARE	The personal computer industry will innovate faster and produce more wealth for society if Microsoft chairman Bill Gates sets the pace and his competitors respond to his moves rather than try to deprive Microsoft of its leading position through lawsuits or other means. Apple Computers, for example, sued Microsoft because Microsoft's Windows provides cheap software emulations of Apple's high-priced Macintosh line. Apple would like to continue making money by selling old technology at high prices in small volumes. I.B.M. has traditionally followed the same strategy.
9/15/1991	MR. SOFTWARE	The fact that Gates is acquiring art reproductions from museums is disturbing. What financially pressed museum director can run with a billionaire. Given the wretched financing of our museums, these rights may be the very thing that will enable museums to survive -- and to present great art as essentially different from the endless matrix of images we generate. BJARNE F. ROSTAING New York, N.Y.
9/15/1991	MR. SOFTWARE	"As capitalists, we are taught from the cradle to be visionaries, to break ground, to create a business and fight to make it succeed (""""Mr. Software"""" by Fred Moody, Aug. 25). That's exactly what Bill Gates has done with Microsoft, and now everyone is mad at him for doing it. As Apple Computers, the I.B.M. Corporation and the Federal Trade Commission marshal their forces, they should remember one thing: competition. Gates is the Henry Ford of our generation, and if you don't like it, go build a Honda. DON ROSS New York, N.Y."
9/5/1991	A Director of Research Is Named at Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday appointed Richard Rashid, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, to the new position of director of research. Mr. Rashid, 39, is widely known for his work in designing advanced computer operating systems, including a project known as Mach, which has become the basis for the commercial operating systems used by Steven Jobs's Next Inc. and the Open Software Foundation. Mr. Rashid will report to Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's vice president of advanced technology and business development.
9/4/1991	Sun to Enter Race to Offer Software	Sun Microsystems Inc. is beginning an attempt to become a major supplier of operating system software for computers, putting it into direct competition with Microsoft and a new joint venture of Apple and I.B.M. Sun will announce on Wednesday that it is developing a version of its operating system, which is the basic set of commands for controlling computers, that will run on personal computers using microprocessors made by the Intel Corporation. Sun's operating system now runs only on machines that use Sun's Sparc microprocessor. Such machines are mainly Sun's own work stations.
8/30/1991	Goods Seized by Microsoft	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it, in conjunction with United States marshals, had made a large seizure of counterfeit software. Six individuals and 10 businesses said to have participated in a Los Angeles-based counterfeiting scheme may have been distributing illegal software throughout the United States for more than a year, Microsoft said. The company has filed a civil suit against them in the Federal Court for the Central District of California.
8/25/1991	Mr. Software	"The small conference room is packed when Bill Gates, chairman of the Seattle-based Microsoft Corporation, strolls in and sits down at the head of the room's only table. On the wall behind him is a woodblock print depicting a single unarmed samurai pushing sword-bearing attackers off a scaffold surrounding a gigantic stone Buddha. Seated around the table, standing in corners and perched atop a credenza against one wall are 14 programmers (""""computer geeks,"""" in Microsoft parlance). All but one are male, and all are dressed more or less like Gates, who usually wears light-colored slacks and a long-sleeved shirt, sans tie. Now 35, Gates looks and sounds like an aging Dennis the Menace. The lenses of his oversize eyeglasses are coated with grime. His is hardly the image one conjures up when picturing the world's leading software executive, with a personal net worth of $4.4 billion -- said to be the 23d-largest personal fortune in the world. Nor is it the likely image of one of America's most embattled industrialists, with the Federal Trade Commission investigating him, and the I.B.M. Corporation and Apple Computers ganging up on him in a desperate attempt to end his absolute rule of the personal-computer industry."
8/11/1991	CORRECTIONS	A chart last Sunday with an article about the Microsoft Corporation, depicting the capitalization of six major computer companies and their ratio of capitalization to revenues, carried an incorrect legend for shading that denoted the types of company. The three major software producers were represented by black bars, hardware producers by white ones.
8/4/1991	The Executive Computer; Novell Adding Weapons for the Contest With Microsoft	NOVELL INC. of Orem, Utah, makes the Netware operating system that is the most popular software for connecting networks of personal computers. Last month it announced that it hoped to acquire Digital Research Inc., which makes the DR DOS 5.0 operating system. Many people believe DR DOS 5.0 is technically superior to the MS-DOS 5.0 made by the Microsoft Corporation. Assuming the deal is completed in October as planned, Novell hopes to be able to offer customers a tightly integrated operating system for desktop personal computers and the larger PC's that act as hubs, or servers, on a network. The bottom line, Novell believes, is that a network operating system that embraces desktops as well as the wires that connect them would be significantly easier to set up, maintain and operate.
8/4/1991	One Day, Junior Got Too Big	TEN years ago this month, the International Business Machines Corporation introduced its first personal computer, changing the computer industry forever. Almost overlooked at the time was the company chosen to provide key software for the machine, headed by a nerdy programmer young enough to be the son of many of the I.B.M. executives. No one is overlooking the results of that decision today. Seizing on that initial opportunity to provide the MS-DOS operating system for I.B.M. personal computers and the clones that followed, the Microsoft Corporation has grown into the world's largest software company, with revenues of $1.8 billion for the fiscal year ending in June. Its reach expands into nearly every nook and cranny of the software business.
7/27/1991	Microsoft Widens Its Split With I.B.M. Over Software	The Microsoft Corporation is moving its software strategy farther away from that of the International Business Machines Corporation, its one-time partner, company executives said. Microsoft supplies the MS-DOS operating system used on I.B.M. and compatible personal computers. And the company worked with I.B.M. on OS/2, which was supposed to be a successor to DOS. But recently Microsoft and I.B.M. have had a bitter divorce, with I.B.M. continuing to support OS/2 while Microsoft supports its own program known as Windows.
7/26/1991	Rulings in Macintosh Suit	A Federal judge today dismissed several claims raised by the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company in response to a copyright suit by Apple Computer Inc. over its Macintosh display technology. In a series of pretrial rulings, Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker said Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard would not be allowed to argue at trial that the Macintosh pictorial window displays lacked the originality required for copyright protection.
7/25/1991	Microsoft's Net Up 73% in the 2d Quarter	The Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest personal computer software company, continued being a juggernaut of growth in revenues and earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter. In the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft said it earned $138.4 million, or 73 cents a share, up 73 percent, from the $80.0 million, or 43 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter of 1990. Revenues for the quarter increased 56 percent to $526.6 million, from $337.0 million.
7/18/1991	When I.B.M.'s Big Guns Won't Do	In windowless rooms here, jammed with personal computers and young programamers and littered with empty soda cans, I.B.M. is trying to prove that a giant company can produce software to match the best programs crafted by the wizards of Silicon Valley. Writing brilliant software is still more art than science, best done by quirky and obsessive hackers willing to immerse themselves in thorny problems for months at a stretch. Until now the world's largest computer maker has taken its usual regimented approach, sending out battalions of programmers to conquer problems with heavy artillery instead of a few rifle shots.
7/14/1991	The Executive Computer; What's in I.B.M.'s and Apple's Gunsights? Microsoft	The real significance of the recently announced treaty between the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc., some analysts say, is that it is likely to end the industry's dependence on the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, which started out supplying key components of the original I.B.M. PC and eventually wrested control of the personal computer industry and its profits. Since I.B.M. introduced its PC 10 years ago, personal computers and software have grown into a $60 billion annual market. But I.B.M.'s share of the PC market has been reduced by hungry rivals, and Apple has been hurt by its inability to gain a foothold in the corporate market. Through their alliance, they hope to reassert control. In the proposed deal, Apple would become, in essence, a software company competing directly against Microsoft. I.B.M. would provide the microprocessor technology for a generation of powerful desktop business computers. The chip itself is to be built by Intel's archrival, Motorola Inc., as well as by I.B.M. itself.
7/7/1991	The Executive Computer; Can You See the Standards Through the Fog?	Like fog banks rolling over an already jumbled terrain, in the last two weeks two alliances each proposed to create a new industrywide standard for the class of powerful personal computers known as RISC-based work stations. Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation signed a letter of intent on Wednesday to develop advanced operating system software that will run on the next generation of both Apple and I.B.M. high-end personal computers. The computers will be built around a new version of I.B.M.'s RISC System/6000 microprocessor, which will be jointly developed by I.B.M. and Motorola Inc.
7/4/1991	I.B.M. and Apple Give Up Rivalry To Preserve Grip on Their Industry	Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M., longtime archenemies, threw in their lots together today in a bold attempt to maintain their powerful yet threatened positions in the computer industry. The two companies have signed a letter of intent to work together to create advanced software and powerful computers in a deal that despite being rumored for weeks still had the industry abuzz when it was officially announced.
7/2/1991	Microsoft's Big Push Into Electronic 'Books'	The Microsoft Corporation, whose software for personal computers dominates the market, has aggressively entered the business of putting books and encyclopedias on compact disks, causing concerns in the fledgling industry. One fear is that the company will shrewdly use its dual role as a developer of the technical tools used in producing electronic books and as a publisher of electronic materials in its own right. Others worry that Microsoft, with more than a billion dollars in sales last year, will out-muscle its rivals, eventually dominating the industry.
6/29/1991	Inquiry By F.T.C. Into Intel	The Federal Trade Commission has begun an investigation into the Intel Corporation's business practices, the company said today. Intel said it was notified by a letter received on Thursday, and that it would cooperate fully and immediately with the investigation. Executives at several personal computer manufacturers have said lawyers for the agency contacted them in recent weeks regarding reportedly anti-competitive practices by the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor company, which dominates the business of supplying microprocessors for computers. But until today it was not clear that a formal investigation was under way.
6/18/1991	PC Tools and Norton, Updated	"THE Microsoft Corporation MS-DOS 5.0 upgrade kit, which updates the operating system software used in tens of millions of I.B.M. PC's and compatibles, includes several new features that used to be found only in specialized utility packages like PC Tools Deluxe or the Norton Utilities. For example, MS-DOS 5.0 now has a better system of formating diskettes and hard disks, a new system for searching for misplaced files, a better graphical """"shell"""" for simplifying DOS operations and preparing users to move to Windows, an improved on-line help system, and an """"undelete"""" command that restores accidentally erased files and directories."
6/11/1991	DOS Goes on a Streamlined Diet	THE Microsoft Corporation is introducing an important new version of MS-DOS today. MS-DOS is the operating system software that controls tens of millions of I.B.M. PC and compatible computers worldwide. The new version, MS-DOS 5.0, is a welcome upgrade that goes a long way toward lifting the curse that it has been under for a decade. The curse, which limits the main working memory of MS-DOS to 640 kilobytes, was created by Microsoft and the International Business Machines Corporation when they collaborated on the original I.B.M. PC in 1981. Back then, 640 kilobytes seemed like more memory than anyone would ever use, since it was 10 times the amount available for the original PC.
6/10/1991	TECHNOLOGY LINKS WILL BE DISCUSSED BY APPLE AND I.B.M.	Top executives of Apple Computer Inc. will be visiting the headquarters of the International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., on Monday to discuss a far-ranging technology alliance that could have a major impact on the computer industry, industry executives say. One part of the talks, according to these executives, is a proposal for I.B.M. to license from Apple, and perhaps even to help develop, basic software for a new line of Apple computers that will be a successor to its Macintosh family.
6/10/1991	High Hopes At Microsoft For Product	More than 60 million computers now use the DOS software developed by the Microsoft Corporation, and when the nation's largest software company introduces a new version on Tuesday, it expects many customers to welcome the chance to improve their computing. DOS is an operating system -- the software that controls the basic operations of a personal computer and allows it to work with other software that perform specific functions, known as applications software.
6/9/1991	The Executive Computer; A Familiar Programming Language Enters the Windows Age	The Microsoft Corporation has created a version of the Basic programming language, called Visual Basic, which promises to make it much easier for businesses to develop customized applications of Windows and similarly friendly facades for older programs. Some programmers are hailing the new language as a breakthrough. Visual Basic will be available later this month at a list price of $199. It is not going to replace C or C++, the other computer languages currently used to write Windows applications, and a fluency in those powerful but arcane languages will still be required to do the most complicated Windows programs.
5/24/1991	Apple Broadens Attack In Copyright Lawsuit	In a surprise move, Apple Computer Inc. has opened a new line of attack in its copyright infringement lawsuit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard by asking the court to rescind a 1985 licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft. If Apple's request is granted it will leave the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company far more vulnerable to infringement claims, since the licensing agreement has been the central part of their defense.
5/21/1991	Microsoft Plans Basic Research Lab	"The Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest publisher of personal computer software, has quietly begun recruiting talented scientists for its first basic research center. Earlier this month, the company hired three leading scientists away from I.B.M. to join its effort. The three, George Heidron, Steve Richardson and Karen Jensen, have been at the center of the International Business Machines Corporation's research in computer linguistics. Their work has several important uses, including speech recognition, grammar checking and the sifting of huge libraries of data for key information without using technical computer commands. Data 'at Your Fingertips' The field, known as natural language processing, is essential for new software that Microsoft is developing to put -- as William H. Gates, the company's founder and chairman, has boasted -- """"information at your fingertips."""" In a speech last November, he announced the goal of allowing business people and students with little computer training to immediately call up on desktop computers all the information they needed."
5/20/1991	Companies in Apple Suit Pessimistic on Settling	"The companies in the closely watched copyright lawsuit filed by Apple Computer Inc. against the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, have discussed settling the case, according to a court filing. The companies said, however, that """"there are no foreseeable prospects for a settlement."""" The brief mention of settlement talks was in a statement filed jointly by the companies on Friday in the Federal District Court in San Francisco. The filing was designed to outline the positions of the companies on where the case should go from here. Judge Vaughn R. Walker will hold a hearing on that subject on Thursday."
5/20/1991	A Software Alliance Is Expected	"The Lotus Development Corporation and Adobe Systems Inc., will announce today that Lotus will include computer font technology developed by Adobe in the version of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet program it is developing for the Microsoft Corporation's Windows software. The alliance between Lotus and Adobe Systems, a software publisher of digital typography software and fonts based in Mountain View, Calif., is the latest move in the convoluted computer industry """"font wars"""" that have set traditional allies against each other and made confidants out of competitors."
4/18/1991	65% Profit Rise for Microsoft	Despite a slump by many companies in the personal computer business, the Microsoft Corporation reported on Tuesday that it had a 65 percent increase in profit on a 57 percent increase in revenue. For its third quarter ended March 31, Microsoft had net income of $123.8 million, or 98 cents a share, up from $75.2 million, or 62 cents, for the comparable period a year earlier. Sales rose to $486.9 million, from $310.9 million. Per-share figures reflect a 4 percent increase in shares outstanding, to 126.3 million.
4/17/1991	Gains Shown by Microsoft Despite Slump for Industry	Despite the slump suffered by many companies in the personal computer business, the Microsoft Corporation reported today that it had a 65 percent increase in profit on a 57 percent increase in revenue. For its third fiscal quarter, ended March 31, Microsoft had net income of $123.8 million, or 98 cents a share, up from $75.2 million, or 62 cents, for the comparable period a year earlier. Sales rose to $486.9 million, from $310.9 million. Per-share figures reflect a 4 percent increase in shares outstanding, to 126.3 million.
4/15/1991	I.B.M. Going on Offensive To Promote Key Software	I.B.M., the world's largest computer company, has been pushed out of the personal computer and software spotlight by its software partner, the Microsoft Corporation, and this week, it begins a slow process of trying to push itself back in. In a series of meetings with analysts and software developers, I.B.M. will begin a lobbying and marketing campaign that trumpets the virtues of the operating system it will bring out later this year. At issue is not just who produces the better personal computer operating system -- which acts in the computer like the conductor of an orchestra, issuing orders and coordinating players -- but who sets industry standards.
4/14/1991	The Executive Computer; Borland Is Making the Most of Old Technology	"For users not yet ready or willing to switch to the Windows operating system from the Microsoft Corporation, Borland International's new Quattro Pro spreadsheet, version 3.0, offers almost the same """"what you see is what you get"""" graphics and commands. Perhaps more than any other recent program, Quattro Pro proves that there is still plenty of life left in the DOS operating system. The Quattro Pro graphical interface is the most noticeable improvement in what many people already regarded as the best spreadsheet for personal computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation and compatible models. The true value of a spreadsheet is its ability to manipulate and consolidate numbers, and Quattro Pro does that as well as program."
4/13/1991	Microsoft Says F.T.C. Has Expanded Inquiry	"The Microsoft Corporation said today that the Federal Trade Commission had expanded its investigation of the competitive practices of the software company. """"The purpose of this broadened investigation is to examine allegations that Microsoft Corporation has monopolized or has attempted to monopolize the market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software and computer peripherals for personal computers,"""" Norris E. Washington, a lawyer with the F.T.C., wrote in a letter on Thursday to William H. Neukom, Microsoft's vice president for law and corporate affairs."
4/10/1991	New Computer Consortium	Twenty-one computer makers and software publishers said yesterday that they planned to develop a computing system based on two competing computer chips and two software operating systems. The group developing the system, called the Advanced Computing Environment, is headed by Compaq Computer, Microsoft, MIPS Computer Systems, Digital Equipment and the Santa Cruz Operation. The companies said they wanted to create more sophisticated computing systems than those now possible on conventional desktop computers.
4/8/1991	New Computer Alliance Forms	In an extraordinary alliance, more than a dozen computer companies will announce tomorrow their commitment to a new and untried chip they hope will dominate the computing world in the years to come. The strategy underscores how competition in the computer industry increasingly revolves around different chips, known as microprocessors. These tiny powerful chips have redefined the world of computers, blurring the traditional distinctions between machines of different size, from mainframes, minicomputers, work stations and personal computers to laptops.
3/24/1991	The Executive Computer; A Clip-On Mouse for Users on the Road	Executives who use laptop computers and the Windows graphical operating system often have a problem. One can operate Windows software using typed keyboard commands, but Windows really requires a mouse. Mice, in turn, require room to roam, and the person sitting in the next seat on the plane or train might not understand why your hand keeps sliding over onto his or her thigh. The Microsoft Corporation, which created Windows, has now developed a less peripatetic mouse for the traveling executive. The Ballpoint Mouse is a palm-size trackball that attaches to the side of most laptop or notebook computers.
3/19/1991	Microsoft Stake In Publisher	"The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had purchased a 26 percent stake in Dorling Kindersley Ltd., a London-based book publisher. Dorling Kindersley specializes in highly illustrated, practical reference books for adults and children, including """"The Way Things Work,"""" by David Macaulay."
3/19/1991	Type Without Tears	TRUETYPE is a new technology from Apple Computer Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation that greatly improves the way text appears on the computer screen and on printed documents. Truetype allows the user to make the type as big or small as needed, in any increment, and it gets rid of the jagged lines and broken curves that appear when you least want them. Impatient Macintosh users can add Truetype to the latest operating system software (version 6.0.7) by obtaining a special Truetype program from user groups or from on-line information services like Compuserve or America Online. Otherwise, Truetype will be included in the next versions of Macintosh system software (version 7.0, expected in May) and Microsoft Windows (version 3.1, later this year) for I.B.M. PC's and compatibles.
3/19/1991	Apple May Widen Sale Of Operating Systems	Apple Computer Inc. is likely to become much more aggressive in competing with the Microsoft Corporation and others as a vendor of operating systems, the basic software for controlling computers, according to Apple officials and industry executives. In a speech here today and in remarks to reporters afterward, Apple's chairman and chief executive, John Sculley, suggested that Apple was developing a new operating system that could run on several different types of microprocessors and on different types of computers, not only Apple's machines. A Dramatic Departure The move would be a dramatic departure for Apple, which has always guarded its operating systems software like a crown jewel. And it would match a move by the Microsoft Corporation, which is developing a new operating system called OS/2 Version 3, which will run on computers using a variety of microprocessors, including those using advanced technology known as RISC, or reduced instruction set computing.
3/15/1991	Microsoft's Tactics Questioned by Rivals	Three years ago when a start-up company called the Go Corporation began to develop software to control a new breed of pen-based computers, it showed its idea to software companies that it hoped would develop word processors, spreadsheets and other applications programs for its system. One group that saw the work was a team from the Microsoft Corporation. As the introduction of its software approached, Go got a rude surprise. Microsoft said it was developing its own software system operated by pens rather than keyboards to compete directly with Go's software. Leading Microsoft's development effort was the chief engineer on the team that got an early look at Go's work.
3/13/1991	Microsoft In Inquiry By F.T.C.	The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the competitive practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the maker of software for personal computers. The F.T.C. does not comment on investigations in progress, but some industry executives reached by the commission said the investigation addresses whether Microsoft had used its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other areas, including applications software, like word processors, and peripheral products, primarily the mouse pointing device.
3/12/1991	Microsoft's Mouse	The Microsoft Corporation said it had developed the first computer mouse designed to work with laptop computers. The pointing device, which is used to manipulate an on-screen arrow and to execute commands, has previously needed a flat surface like a desk or tabletop to operate. Consequently, a mouse has been awkward when used with portable computers. The ball in Microsoft's new mouse sits on top and is rotated using the thumb or index finger. The mouse, which has a recommended retail price of $175, is designed to work with Microsoft's Windows graphics program.
3/8/1991	Ruling Bolsters Apple Shares	The stock of Apple Computer Inc. moved up today and that of the Microsoft Corporation moved down in the wake of a court decision that was favorable to Apple in its long-running software copyright suit against Microsoft and the Hewlett- Packard Company. A Federal judge on Wednesday rejected two arguments made by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard that would have weakened Apple's lawsuit or resulted in its being thrown out of court. While the three-year- old case is far from over, it is moving closer to a jury trial.
3/7/1991	Judge Favors Apple Stand On Copyright	A Federal judge today dismissed two critical defenses offered by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in the software copyright-infringment lawsuit filed against them by Apple Computer Inc. The ruling could move the now three-year-old case closer to trial. Had the judge accepted the arguments by the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, Apple's case would have been substantially weakened and might have been tossed out entirely.
3/3/1991	The Executive Computer; Operating Systems for PC's Grow More Confusing	Reports that the OS/2 operating system is dead are greatly exaggerated, officials of the Microsoft Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation say. Yet there appears to be a great deal of confusion about the future of OS/2 -- and about the future of personal computer operating systems in general. The confusion stems in part from the decision late last year by Microsoft and I.B.M., which had collaborated to develop the industry-standard DOS operating system, to part company on the developmental responsibilities for operating systems.
2/27/1991	Microsoft Gets Support on New System	Twenty-one computer makers say they plan to use a Microsoft Corporation operating system in notebook-sized computers that use a stylus rather than a keyboard, according to the company. A statement issued on Monday by Microsoft said the plans were announced by manufacturers at a conference on the system, called Pen Windows, last week.
2/17/1991	The Executive Computer; Networld: The Talk Is of Strategic Partnerships	When 20,000 managers of corporate computer systems gathered at the Networld 91 trade show here last week, they found vivid proof that the personal computer industry remains in a mating frenzy, with companies seeking strategic partners in virtually every market corner. The latest significant technological pairing, announced at the show, brought together Novell Inc., of Provo, Utah, the leading maker of operating system software for personal computer networks, and the International Business Machines Corporation.
2/9/1991	Group Seen Nearing PC Accord	A powerful group of computer makers and software publishers is nearing an agreement to develop a standard for an advanced desktop computer that it hopes will unseat the reigning powers of the personal computer industry by the middle of the decade. The emerging alliance, led by Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Digital Equipment, is gambling that it can create a personal computer based on a chip design called RISC that is simpler and faster than that used in computers made by I.B.M., Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems, the leaders in the desktop sector of the industry.
1/22/1991	A Battle in Pen-Based Computers	A battle to control what is expected to become the next big form of personal computing begins in earnest this week with the introduction of software for operating small computers that are controlled by writing with a pen rather than typing on a keyboard. The Go Corporation, a start-up based here, is scheduled to demonstrate its Penpoint software, which is designed to serve as the operating system, the basic controlling software, for pen-based computers.
1/20/1991	The Executive Computer; The Latest Excel Leapfrogs Its Spreadsheet Rivals	PersonaL computer spreadsheets have become much more than mere number-crunching engines. Although they are primarily used to collect, organize and analyze numbers, spreadsheets are also used by many executives as data bases, as report generators and as chart and graphics designers. Some hard-core spreadsheet users even use them as word processors. That is not recommended. But the new Microsoft Excel 3.0 spreadsheet ($495 for I.B.M. PC-class computers equipped with the Microsoft Windows operating system) has so many convenient features and is so attuned to the needs of business users that an executive might be tempted to spend all day working in it.
1/13/1991	The Executive Computer; Excel Raises the Spreadsheet Stakes	The Microsoft Corporation last week showed off a substantially improved and innovative version of its PC Excel spreadsheet program, the first number-crunching program to run with the enormously popular Windows 3.0 operating software that Microsoft produces. Excel version 3.0 (list price, $495) is the first major revision of the product in almost three years, and the wait was worth it: Excel 3.0 matches virtually all the major features of competing spreadsheets and adds some new tricks of its own, all within the increasingly popular Windows graphical interface.
1/9/1991	Microsoft's New Spreadsheet Challenges Lotus	"Microsoft will turn up the heat on Lotus on Wednesday when it introduces a new version of its Excel personal computer spreadsheet program that works with its popular Windows 3.0 graphics-based control program. Analysts say the threat to its rival could be the most serious yet. """"I've never seen Lotus management quite so concerned before,"""" said Rick Sherlund, software industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company."
12/31/1990	American Industry Faces the Challenge of Tougher Times	William H. Gates Microsoft's Payoff For Persistence More than anyone in the computer industry, 1990 belonged to William H. Gates, chairman and co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation. After seven years of unsuccessfully attempting to persuade PC users that his Windows software was the wave of future, Mr. Gates tried a third time this summer. He spent $10 million to introduce Windows 3.0 and managed to convince almost everyone that even if the program is not perfect, it is inevitable. The 35-year-old entrepreneur's extraordinary success with Windows 3.0 underlined the increasingly vital role that software plays in the computer industry. And Microsoft's position today seems so strong that many industry executives are now convinced that it is Mr. Gates, and not I.B.M., who will set the direction for computing in the 1990's. Since 1987, Microsoft and I.B.M. had been trying to persuade business customers to abandon their MS-DOS-based computers for the more powerful but untried alternative of a OS/2 operating system, which used I.B.M. hardware and special Microsoft software. But few users moved up. So in 1990, Mr. Gates decided to improve the lot of the nation's 40 million MS-DOS users by evolution rather than revolution -- and Windows 3.0 was the tool. I.B.M. and I.B.M.-compatible computers may now be operated with a hand-held mouse and on-screen symbols, as is Apple's Macintosh, rather than by typing in commands. Microsoft's growth has been stunning at a time when most of the computer industry has stagnated. Its profits jumped 47 percent, to $279.2 million. The Redmond, Wash., billionaire has begun to shed his bespectacled-nerd image. He is building a lake-front home that will have a garage large enough to hold 80 cars, evidence of a passion beyond software.

12/2/1990	The Executive Computer; Who Has Really Tried Windows?	WINDOWS 3.0, which covers the homely and inscrutable face of PC-DOS with a prettier, less-confusing mask, has been a phenomenally successful product. The Microsoft Corporation says it has sold one million copies since introducing the software in early summer. Windows applications were ubiquitous at the recent Comdex/Fall trade show in Las Vegas, so much so that the Comdex organizers announced plans for next year to spin off yet another trade show dedicated exclusively to Windows products.
11/27/1990	New Ways to Play Games With Windows	IF you have friends or relatives who use the Microsoft Corporation's new Windows 3.0 on their computers, you can give them packages of fun for the holidays. Games are a much safer bet than expensive major applications that might not be what they want. Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows contains seven games that were, according to the company, written or adapted by Windows programmers for their own amusement. They became so popular around headquarters that it was decided to market them.
11/15/1990	Z-Nix Settles Suit Against Microsoft	The Z-Nix Company, a small personal computer accessory maker, has settled its lawsuit accusing the software giant Microsoft of restraint of trade and breach of contract. Under terms of the settlement, Microsoft will license Z-Nix to use Microsoft's Windows software through 1991. It will then negotiate a renewal with Z-Nix. Neither company disclosed details. Z-Nix, based in Pomona, makes the computer-control device known as a mouse. It filed the $4.5 million suit in Federal court in Los Angeles last week. The suit contended that Microsoft had unfairly doubled its $27.50-a-copy charge for Windows when Z-Nix wanted to pair the software with its own mouse device.
11/12/1990	Microsoft's Bold New Game Plan	Is William H. Gates the most powerful man in the computer industry? Many people describe the chairman and chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation that way, often with as much fear as admiration. With its Windows 3.0 software selling an estimated 30,000 copies a week, Microsoft had larger revenues in the last quarter than Computer Associates, which has been the nation's largest software company. It also appears to have eclipsed I.B.M. -- at least for now -- as the standard-setter in the desktop computer industry.
10/17/1990	Profits Up at Microsoft and Down at Lotus	LEAD: The Microsoft Corporation today reported strong gains in revenues and earnings, while the Lotus Development Corporation reported declining earnings on essentially flat sales, which it attributed to upgrading its most popular product.
9/24/1990	Rift on Software Arouses Concerns	LEAD: Like an earthquake that rattles windows and breaks china but leaves the roof intact, the decision last week by the International Business Machines Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation to pursue separate paths in developing software has filled many people in the computer industry with anxiety about the next tremor.
9/18/1990	I.B.M. and Microsoft Revise Software Pact	LEAD: The International Business Machines Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation today redefined the way they will work together in developing basic software for personal computers.
9/17/1990	I.B.M. Reported in Dispute With Microsoft on Software	LEAD: Executives of the International Business Machines Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation met this weekend to try to clarify the relationship of the companies in developing basic software for personal computers, according to industry officials and a trade publication.
9/7/1990	I.B.M. Is Joining Metaphor To Create a New Software	LEAD: I.B.M. announced a new business partnership yesterday with Metaphor Computer Systems, a privately held company in Mountain View, Calif. in which I.B.M. has a minority stake, to create new software that will allow individual programs to run with multiple computer operating systems.
8/31/1990	Service Unit For Microsoft	LEAD: The Microsoft Corporation today formed a new consulting services business aimed at helping large corporate customers build complex computing systems using its products. The new group, Information
8/24/1990	Suit By Apple Is Extended	LEAD: The long-running copyright infringment suit brought by Apple Computer Inc. against the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company will run a little longer.
8/22/1990	Challenge To Microsoft Advancing	LEAD: The effort to challenge the domination of the Microsoft Corporation's software that allows desktop computers to operate popular programs like word processors and spreadsheets gained momentum yesterday as three companies agreed on a single standard for the rival Unix software.
8/7/1990	More on Windows 3.0	LEAD: FOR the second stage of testing Windows 3.0, the new Microsoft graphical interface, with a modestly endowed AT-class computer, I loaded a selection of software that had not been written with Windows in mind. That is, each of the programs got its own little icon, or symbol, and could be run by putting the on-screen pointer on the icon and clicking the mouse button twice, even though they had not been designed for a graphical environment.
7/31/1990	Macintosh Power For Non-Power Users	LEAD: WINDOWS 3.0, the new Microsoft graphical interface, gives high-end MS-DOS computers much of the power and ease of use of the Macintosh. But what about those who don't use high-end computers? To rephrase an early Mac slogan, what about the rest of us? To find out, I installed Windows on a mid-level computer of the type still found in many homes and offices, and still selling in large, though decreasing, numbers: an AT-class machine (that is, one using the 80286 processor) with a 30-megabyte hard disk, V.G.A.
7/27/1990	Microsoft On Profits	LEAD: After reporting record earnings and revenues on Wednesday for its 15th year in business, the Microsoft Corporation cautioned today that its unusually strong profits were not likely to continue in the next fiscal year.
7/26/1990	Microsoft Net Increases 76.2%	LEAD: Buoyed by strong initial sales of its new Windows 3.0 product, the Microsoft Corporation today reported a 76.2 percent rise in net income for its fourth fiscal quarter, on a 53 percent gain in revenue.

Industry analysts said the sales figure was in line with expectations.
6/5/1990	Windows 3.0 Software	LEAD: WINDOWS 3.0 is already being hailed by some analysts as the product of the year in the personal computer industry, quite an accomplishment for what is essentially an updated version of a software package that was first announced in 1983.
5/29/1990	What Is Windows 3.0 Really Like?	LEAD: WINDOWS 3.0, the new software that the Microsoft Corporation describes as a ''graphical environment'' for I.B.M. PC and compatible computers, really hides the Phantom of the Operating System behind an attractive mask. The true face of DOS, the Disk Operating System, resides in dark, hidden chambers deep within tens of millions of PC's.
5/27/1990	The Executive Computer;   Fresh Windows of Opportunity for PC Users	LEAD: Windows 3.0, the graphical operating system released last week by the Microsoft Corporation, does not transform an I.B.M.-style personal computer into an operational ''clone'' of the easy-to-use Apple Macintosh.

1/28/1990	The Executive Computer;   Bringing Microsoft's 'Windows' to Critical Mass	LEAD: The recent arrival of the Microsoft Corporation's Word for Windows signals more than just a new entrant in the overcrowded word processing category. Word for Windows (which lists for $495 and is intended for high-end I.B.M. PC and PS/2 compatibles that use the DOS operating system) is the first program that combines advanced ''what you see is what you get'' word processing, desktop publishing features, an easy-to-use graphical command structure and powerful tools for customization.
1/23/1990	Integrated Programs	LEAD: INTEGRATED programs typically combine several applications in one package, including a word processor, a spreadsheet, a data base, a communication module, a program for creating charts, etc., and perhaps some other odds and ends, like a macro generator or a calendar or a grammar checker.
1/18/1990	Net Up 56.8% At Microsoft	LEAD: Despite a broad-based slowdown in the personal computer market, the Microsoft Corporation today reported its best financial results ever.
1/16/1990	Basic Beyond Simple	LEAD: FOR anyone who wants to learn something about programming, it would be hard to find an easier or more cost-effective source than ''Learn Basic Now,'' a book-disk combination at $39.95 from Microsoft Press.

6/15/1986	NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Redmond, Wash.; A Liveable Workplace	LUNCHTIME loungers around the small lake at the Microsoft world headquarters here like to say that their new $30 million corporate campus is ''worker-friendly.'' With its rugged forest setting, basketball court, sports complex and views from each of the nearly 1,000 offices, the 30-acre site seems more like summer camp than home for one of the world's biggest computer-software suppliers.
4/17/1986	Lotus Net Up; Microsoft Rises	The Lotus Development Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation, the two leading suppliers of software for personal computers, both announced today that they had increased earnings and sales.

2/11/1986	Market Place; Many Eyes On Microsoft	THE Microsoft Corporation, a leader in the personal computer-software industry, plans to go public next month, selling 2.5 million shares. Its reception in the marketplace, according to industry followers, could determine whether a host of other prospective new issues related to computers will see the light of day later this year. ''This is a quality company with a broad product line and a well-known name,'' said Scott Smith, an analyst with the Gartner Group. ''I'd expect it to be a hot issue.''
2/10/1986	Licensing Suit Is Cited In Microsoft Stock Offer	Rod Brock, president of Seattle Computer Products Inc., must feel a little like Pete Best, the drummer who left the Beatles just before their rise to stardom. Mr. Brock's company developed the program that would become MS-DOS, the standard disk operating system for the I.B.M. PC and compatible computers, but sold it to the Microsoft Corporation for $50,000 and certain licensing rights. Spurred by MS-DOS and other programs such as Microsoft Basic, Microsoft, of Bellevue, Wash., has grown to be the second-largest personal computer software company, behind the Lotus Development Company, and last week announced its long-awaited initial public offering. In the offering's prospectus was a notice that Seattle Computer, based in Kent, Wash., had filed suit against Microsoft.

9/4/1985	MICROSOFT HAS IT ALL - ALMOST	Something is gnawing at Microsoft. By all accounts, the Microsoft Corporation, the first major company spawned by the personal computer to reach its 10th birthday, has a lot to celebrate. Clearly the company has prospered, with revenues leaping by more than 40 percent in its last fiscal year. It has by far the broadest product line among software companies. And recently it signed a long-term agreement with the International Business Machines Corporation that is seen as cementing Microsoft's position at the center of the personal computer universe. ''They're just on top of the world right now, as far as I'm concerned,'' said David S. Wagman, co-chairman of Softsel Computer Products, a leading distributor of software.
8/22/1985	MICROSOFT AND I.B.M. JOIN FORCES	The International Business Machines Corporation has agreed with the Microsoft Corporation, a key software supplier, to develop fundamental software for personal computers, the companies said today. But Microsoft will be able to sell the jointly developed operating systems to other computer manufacturers, which should allay industry fears that I.B.M. would one day migrate to its own, proprietary operating system. That could have locked others in the industry out of the market and made it impossible for existing software to run on future I.B.M. computers.
