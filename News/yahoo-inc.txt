2009-10-24	Icahn Steps Down From Yahoo's Board	Carl C. Icahn, who joined the board of Yahoo last year after threatening a proxy fight, has stepped down, saying the company no longer needed an activist director. Mr. Icahn, below, said he did not have enough time to devote to Yahoo, according to a letter to the board that he released Friday. Mr. Icahn had sought to take control of the board and oust Jerry Yang as chief last year, after Yahoo spurned a $47.5 billion acquisition offer by Microsoft. To ward off a proxy fight, Yahoo gave board seats to Mr. Icahn and two of his candidates in August 2008. Since then, Yahoo has hired Carol Bartz as chief executive and forged a search partnership with Microsoft. ''Carol is doing a great job and I believe the Microsoft transaction will provide great long-term benefits, the potential of which many still do not understand,'' Mr. Icahn said.

Privacy considerations aside, it is a technology that will need refinement if it is to be used by public health officials for early warning duties. One study, published by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, examined the relationship between searches for influenza-related terms on the Yahoo search engine and the actual occurrence of influenza over a four-year period in the United States. The searches spiked one to three weeks in advance of a sharp rise in laboratory cultures testing positive for influenza and up to five weeks in advance of a rise in mortality due to influenza.

2006-04-30	AOL: A Punching Bag In Need of a Big Hit	TIME WARNER will announce its first-quarter results on Wednesday, the first since the Icahn Insurgency against the company fizzled. Aside from a renewed enthusiasm for cable television -- one of Time Warner's myriad businesses -- Wall Street is not expecting sudden miracles from the planet's biggest media conglomerate. And, yet again, there is one standout reason for the blasé view of the company: the prospects for America Online, officially rechristened earlier this month as the zippier-sounding AOL. Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch, lowered her estimates for revenue and earnings at Time Warner ''largely due to anticipated weakness at AOL.'' Anthony J. Noto of Goldman Sachs forecast only a modest single-digit long-term growth rate for the company unless it can return AOL to ''meaningful'' growth in revenue and operating earnings -- a prospect, he made clear, ''we do not believe will happen in the foreseeable future.''
2006-04-28	Is Microsoft Preparing Big Attack?	Microsoft reported strong third-quarter revenue growth on Thursday, but analysts said the company also telegraphed a significant increase in spending, an indication that it was preparing to take on its big online rivals, Google and Yahoo. The company reported a 13 percent increase in sales for the quarter, to $10.9 billion, and a 16 percent rise in net income, to $2.98 billion, or 31 cents a share, from $2.56 billion, or 28 cents, in the period a year earlier.

2006-04-17	For Travelers, a Way to Save More Dollars While Using Fewer Clicks	LIFE just got easier for travelers looking for bargains on the Web, while for some of Yahoo's competitors, things just got a bit more complicated. Yahoo announced last week that it had integrated its FareChase technology into its main search engine, so that it can scan multiple sites for airlines, hotels and car rentals and show the lowest-price offers directly in results whenever someone types in, say, ''lowest fares to Las Vegas.''
2006-04-13	Google Chief Rejects Putting Pressure on China	Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, whose company has been sharply criticized for complying with Chinese censorship, said on Wednesday that the company had not lobbied to change the censorship laws and, for now, had no plans to do so. ''I think it's arrogant for us to walk into a country where we are just beginning operations and tell that country how to run itself,'' Mr. Schmidt told reporters from foreign news organizations.
2006-04-09	This Boring Headline Is Written for Google	JOURNALISTS over the years have assumed they were writing their headlines and articles for two audiences -- fickle readers and nitpicking editors. Today, there is a third important arbiter of their work: the software programs that scour the Web, analyzing and ranking online news articles on behalf of Internet search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN. The search-engine ''bots'' that crawl the Web are increasingly influential, delivering 30 percent or more of the traffic on some newspaper, magazine or television news Web sites. And traffic means readers and advertisers, at a time when the mainstream media is desperately trying to make a living on the Web.
2006-04-08	A Tug of War Over Keywords	A LITTLE-NOTICED legal battle between real estate companies in Minnesota may settle a multibillion-dollar legal question that ''has the potential to reshape the way search engines run their core business,'' Eric Goldman, a blogger and law professor at Marquette University (blog.ericgoldman.org), told Minnesota Public Radio. TheMLSonline.com, a listings service, bought several keywords on Google and Yahoo, including ''Edina Realty.'' That did not sit well with a company called -- you guessed it -- Edina Realty.
2006-03-29	Computing The Mysteries Of Attraction	ELIZABETH BRERETON was a freshman at Connecticut College and Robert Smith was a sophomore at Wesleyan in 1965 when they became a part of what might have been this country's first computer dating service. It was called Operation Match, and it sent questionnaires to college campuses around the country. ''There were stacks of them as you went into the dorms,'' Ms. Brereton remembered. Students rated their own looks, intelligence and interests on a scale from one to five and described their ideal date using the same measures. They then returned the survey, along with a $3 fee, to the Operation Match offices in Cambridge, Mass.
2006-03-29	Yahoo Japan in Talks With Online Bank	The Yahoo Japan Corporation, the country's most visited Web portal, said on Wednesday that it was in talks about a possible alliance with Japan Net Bank, an online bank controlled by the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. ''We're considering an alliance,'' said Toru Nagano, a Yahoo Japan spokesman, responding to an earlier report in Nihon Keizai that Yahoo Japan will take a 30 percent stake in Japan Net. ''Nothing has been decided.''
2006-03-28	Google, Once a Maverick in the Business World, Joins the Washington Lobbying Herd	For a company that takes pride in being the quintessential outsider, Google is moving quickly into the ultimate insider's game: lobbying. Started less than a decade ago in a Stanford dorm room, Google has evolved into a multibillion-dollar business, its search engine ubiquitous on the Internet. Its sprawling growth, fueled by a public stock offering in August 2004 that created a market behemoth, has now thrust it into the glare of Washington.
2006-03-21	Google Offers Search Service On Finance	Harnessing yet another data category to its search-engine prowess, Google is introducing a financial information service intended to compete directly with offerings from Microsoft, Yahoo and other sources, Google executives said Monday. Google said the service, at finance.google.com, would distinguish itself by providing stock charts with interactive qualities like those on its Google Maps service, allowing users to find deeper or specified layers of data by sliding the cursor.
2006-03-06	Your Personal Shopper With the Initials R.S.S.	DON'T want to risk the indignity of being the last person to know when the new Kate Spade bag hits the market? Merchants stand ready to help. Looking for new ways to reach consumers, retailers like eBags, ICE.com, TowerRecords.com and others are using R.S.S., or ''really simple syndication,'' to feed product alerts to Internet users who have set up personalized Web pages on Yahoo, Google and other sites.
2006-03-02	Yahoo Says It Is Backing Away From TV-Style Web Shows	After proclaiming grand plans to bring elaborately produced sitcoms, talk shows and other television-style programs to the Internet, the head of Yahoo's Media Group said yesterday that he was sharply scaling back those efforts. He said the group would shift its focus to content acquired from other media companies or submitted by users. The executive, Lloyd Braun, the former chairman of ABC Entertainment, was the subject of speculation in recent weeks that he was leaving Yahoo over differences with its chief executive, Terry S. Semel.
2006-02-28	Plan for Fees on Some E-Mail Spurs Protest	A group of nonprofit and public interest groups is beginning a campaign today to protest plans by America Online and Yahoo, which each offer e-mail services, to charge high-volume senders of e-mail fees to guarantee preferred delivery of their messages. AOL and Yahoo are working with Goodmail, a Silicon Valley company, which plans to charge between a quarter-cent and a cent for each message. The two Internet companies will get the bulk of the fees that Goodmail collects.
2006-02-23	Just for Fun, Casual Games Thrive Online	Not all gamers choose games based on how much adrenaline they muster, how elaborate the play is or how realistic the graphics are. Many looking for quick entertainment would instead prefer simplicity in their digital diversions. There are many casual games available for those players who would rather snack than engorge on their gaming entertainment.
2006-02-21	Cellular Carriers Offer Phone With E-Mail but Less Bulk	One common complaint about the BlackBerry and Treo hand-held devices is that while they are great for checking e-mail messages and sending data, they are too bulky and awkward to use as phones. AT&T and Cingular, the country's largest wireless carrier, which is partly owned by AT&T, may have found a solution with the new Nokia 6682 handset to be released today. The phone looks and feels like an ordinary handset, but it includes software that links the phone to the AT&T-Yahoo Web portal or a personalized My Yahoo page.
2006-02-16	Web Firms Questioned On Dealings In China	Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Cisco Systems came under fire at a House human rights hearing on Wednesday for what a subcommittee chairman called a ''sickening collaboration'' with the Chinese government that was ''decapitating the voice of the dissidents'' there. The statements by the chairman, Representative Christopher Smith, Republican of New Jersey, opened a much-anticipated session aimed at getting an accounting of the companies' dealings in China, and to air criticism that they do business there at the peril of human rights.
2006-02-15	China Says Web Controls Follow the West's Lead	Chinese authorities are determined to stop ''harmful information'' from spreading through the Web, but the controls it places on Web sites and Internet service providers do not differ much from those employed by the United States and European countries, a senior official responsible for managing China's Internet said Tuesday. The official, Liu Zhengrong, who supervises Internet affairs for the information office of China's State Council, or cabinet, did not directly dispute the contention of many critics that China operates a vast and technologically sophisticated firewall to protect the ruling Communist Party against what it views as Web-based threats to its authority.
2006-02-13	Yahoo Grapples With Online Rights	In advance of what could be harsh Congressional questioning this week, Yahoo plans to issue a statement today outlining its belief in openness and freedom of speech -- even when it is forced to violate those beliefs by laws in China. Yahoo and three other technology companies are to testify Wednesday before a House human rights subcommittee about their business dealings in China.
2006-02-12	Sending E-Mail? Pay the Toll	To the Editor: You report that AOL and Yahoo are planning to issue the equivalent of electronic stamps so that corporations and institutions may create priority e-mail that is differentiated from spam. It is an excellent idea. But the rest of us who are inundated with electronic trash can use the same protection.
2006-02-12	Sending E-Mail? Pay the Toll	To the Editor: As the director of a nonprofit built on the power of the Internet and free e-mailing, I am outraged by the idea of a fee for sending e-mail. This contradicts the premise of the Internet and will not only hamper communications, but also give preferential treatment to those who can afford such fees, notably large corporations. Our organization has been overwhelmed by the avalanche of spam mail, and is well aware of the huge problem this represents. Messages we send are also increasingly being caught in spam filters, making it difficult or impossible to reach our members, whether to confirm the receipt of applications, sending of funds or other business matters.
2006-02-12	Sending E-Mail? Pay the Toll	To the Editor: Re ''Postage Due, With Special Delivery, for Companies Sending E-Mail to AOL and Yahoo'' (news article, Feb. 5): I believe that many more like me would be more than happy to pay a few cents more per day for a service that verifies the identity of an e-mail sender, and reduces the spam coming into my mailbox. If someone can't afford to pay a quarter of a cent, then his message can't be worth my time either.
2006-02-09	Despite Web Crackdown, Prevailing Winds Are Free	For months now, the news about the news in China has been awful. Carrying out its vow to tighten controls over what it calls ''propaganda,'' the government of President Hu Jintao has busied itself closing publications, firing editorial staffs and jailing reporters. More noticeably, the government has clamped down on the Internet, closing blogger sites, filtering Web sites and e-mail messages for banned words and tightening controls on text messages. Last year, Yahoo was criticized for revealing the identity of an Internet journalist, Shi Tao, who was subsequently jailed. [On Wednesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists said court documents posted on a Chinese Web site showed that Yahoo had done the same in 2003, resulting in the jailing of another writer, Li Zhi.]
2006-02-05	Postage Due, With Special Delivery, for Companies Sending E-Mail to AOL and Yahoo	Companies will soon have to buy the electronic equivalent of a postage stamp if they want to be certain that their e-mail will be delivered to many of their customers. America Online and Yahoo, two of the world's largest providers of e-mail accounts, are about to start using a system that gives preferential treatment to messages from companies that pay from 1/4 of a cent to a penny each to have them delivered. The senders must promise to contact only people who have agreed to receive their messages, or risk being blocked entirely.
2006-02-04	Online Trail Can Lead To Court	Who is sending threatening e-mail to a teenager? Who is saying disparaging things about a company on an Internet message board? Who is communicating online with a suspected drug dealer? These questions, and many more like them, are asked every day of the companies that provide Internet service and run Web sites. And even though these companies promise to protect the privacy of their users, they routinely hand over the most intimate information in response to legal demands from criminal investigators and lawyers fighting civil cases.
2006-01-29	When Terry Met Jerry, Yahoo!	WHEN Yahoo Inc. announced nearly five years ago that Terry S. Semel, then a former leader of the Warner Brothers motion picture studio, would become its chairman and chief executive, the reaction both outside and within Yahoo was not exactly one of wild encouragement. Despite a hugely successful career running companies that make movies, television shows and music, Mr. Semel was immediately labeled an ''old media'' guy. Worse, he was a Hollywood guy, and had barely touched a computer during the nearly two decades he oversaw Warner Brothers with Robert A. Daly.
2006-01-22	This Time, the Revolution Will Be Televised	CONVERGENCE is back, but it is not what it used to be. Following its release after about five years in the halfway house for overblown business ideas, it has been swiftly rehabilitated in the form of various online-offline business ventures. This time around, though, some fairly radical wrinkles on the theme are in the works. One notable example is Google's deal last week to acquire dMarc Broadcasting for up to $1.24 billion.
2006-01-19	Sliding Technology Shares Pull Major Indexes Lower	Stocks suffered their first two-day drop of the year yesterday as disappointing earnings from Intel and Yahoo caused a slide in technology shares. ''A lot of people were swept up in the excitement of this year, but expectations were far too high,'' said Andrew Abrams, a money manager at Abrams Investment Partners and an executive director of Avian Securities in New York. Mr. Abrams owns shares of Intel.
2006-01-18	Yahoo's Profit Surges, but Its Stock Falls	Yahoo said yesterday that its profit rose 80 percent in the fourth quarter, but after deducting several special items, it fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Moreover, Yahoo, which runs the world's largest Internet portal, predicted slower revenue growth in the year ahead, with reduced profit margins. As a result, Yahoo's shares fell nearly 13 percent, to $34.96, as traders digested the results, announced after the regular market session. (Shares of its main rival, Google, fell as well, dropping to $449.20, down almost 4 percent, in after-hours trading.)
2006-01-15	China, Still Winning Against the Web	IT wasn't so long ago that the Internet was seen as a trap for China. The country desperately needed to foster economic growth, and in the early 1990's much of the globe was plugging itself in. Sooner or later, the thinking went, China would have to plug into the Web, too, and however efficiently its leaders might have controlled information in the old days, they would be no match for this new democratic beast, decentralized and crackling with opinion and information from the four corners of the earth.
2006-01-15	Web Sites for the Brave New Electronic B@by	Dispatch from the future: FROM: Carter Kohl, 34 inches, 30 pounds, 17 months. TO: Friends and family. MESSAGE: Feel free to contact me. Even though I cannot read just yet, you can still send me e-mail. My parents will read it to me and will help me respond to all your messages. In advance, thanks for getting in touch. I'll be reading and replying back to you before you know it! YOUNG Carter may not know it, but along with a galloping number of tiny citizens, he is already wired. Despite his limited lexicon, featuring the words fish and light (pronounced ''ish'' and ''ite''), Carter possesses his own e-mail address and an inbox filling up with messages from family and fans.
2006-01-15	CELEBRITY ROAST, INDEED	Finally given a chance to be the one handing out insults rather than suffering them, Martha Stewart graciously demurred last week. At an Advertising Club of New York event at the Union League Club in Midtown, she was among the grandees asked to honor -- and to tease -- the woman of the hour, Wenda Harris Millard, the chief sales officer of Yahoo and a director of Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.
2006-01-06	Google and Yahoo Aim at Another Screen	Two ascending Internet giants, Google and Yahoo, are to make plain today that they intend to move aggressively beyond the Internet browser and onto the television screen. The two companies, already the most popular services for searching and organizing the vast information on the World Wide Web, want to perform the same function for television, which will increasingly be delivered over the Internet.
2005-12-20	Japanese Web Site to Offer Video for Sale	The Softbank Corporation, Japan's second-biggest provider of high-speed Internet services, and its affiliate, Yahoo Japan Corporation, are offering 100,000 movies and video clips on a Web site. The site offers more than 30,000 video clips from content providers, and links to 70,000 movie files on the Internet, the company said yesterday.
2005-12-19	Small Internet Retailers Are Using Web Tools to Level the Selling Field	AMAZON, Walmart.com and other online retailing giants have always had upstarts nipping at their heels. But the little guys are starting to bite harder. Just how sharp their teeth are, however, is a matter of some debate.
2005-12-10	Yahoo Acquisition Expands Its Social Networking Services	Yahoo, the online media company, said Friday that it had acquired Del.icio.us, a small Internet start-up company, in a move to expand its social networking services. Del.icio.us is a nine-month old company that provides software for bloggers, the writers of online diaries that have proliferated on the Web. Specifically, the company stores links to Web sites or bookmarks so the readers of blogs, as well as other Web sites, can use them and share them.
2005-11-28	If It's After Midnight, Then It's Time to Market to Young Men	FOR a growing number of companies including Old Spice and Mountain Dew, night-time may be the right time to reach younger male consumers. Marketers are incorporating nocturnal themes into their advertising in their quest to appeal to hard-partying young men -- or men who think of themselves as hard-partying. And some marketers like Panasonic are focusing their television advertising efforts on late-night hours, hoping to reach younger men who stay up past midnight.
2005-11-14	EBay Expected to End Fees for Third-Party Developers	EBay is expected to announce Monday that it is ending the fees it charges software developers who build Web sites and software programs that channel buyers and sellers its way. The move could help eBay protect its dominance of online auctioneering from an encroachment by Yahoo or Google.
2005-11-11	Yahoo Won't Seek an AOL Deal	Yahoo has dropped out of talks to buy a stake in the America Online unit of Time Warner, leaving Microsoft and Google as potential bidders. Yahoo passed on taking a stake in AOL or buying the business outright, a spokeswoman, Joanna Stevens, said yesterday, citing difficulties Yahoo would face in integrating the acquisition.
2005-11-08	Critics Press Companies On Internet Rights Issues	In an indication of growing tensions between human rights advocates and American Internet and technology companies doing business in countries with repressive regimes, a group of two dozen fund management firms and investment analysts issued a joint statement yesterday urging businesses to adopt policies addressing freedom of expression. The move comes in the wake of public controversy over the decision by Yahoo's Beijing division to cooperate with Chinese authorities seeking to identify the user of a Yahoo e-mail address in China last year.
2005-11-08	Yahoo Tightens Control in Europe and Asia	Yahoo said Monday that it would pay $500 million to buy the remaining shares of its British, German, French and South Korean units to reduce its dependence on the United States market and to compete better with Google. Technology analysts said Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was eager to cement its control of its European businesses so it could take better advantage of the European online advertising market. But they said Yahoo also wanted to catch up with Google's aggressive overseas expansion.
2005-11-07	Yahoo Plans To Connect Services With TiVo	Yahoo and TiVo plan to announce a deal today that will connect Yahoo's vast online service to TiVo's set-top boxes, which, in addition to recording television programs, have a largely unused capability to connect to the Internet. The deal will allow TiVo, which has been struggling to differentiate its service from generic video recorders offered by cable and satellite companies, to offer a range of content and services linked to the Internet.
2005-11-07	Many Suitors, and Many Pitfalls, as AOL Seeks a Partner	Microsoft has emerged as the front-runner in the talks surrounding the potential sale of a stake in America Online, two people involved in the negotiations said. But despite a flurry of interest in AOL from Microsoft, Google and others, finding a deal has been harder than Time Warner may have hoped. Behind the scenes, a number of questions remain that could hold up or even derail a potential transaction.
2005-11-07	The Online Travel Landscape Is Getting Crowded	TRAVEL sites like Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz already have their hands full with airlines and hoteliers -- their ''valued partners'' -- luring consumers away with sites that look more like full-service travel agencies every day. Now, here come Yahoo and AOL, and maybe even Google. AOL, Yahoo and others have intensified their focus on the travel category in the past year, beefing up destination features, introducing tools and scooping up new users and marketers in the process. This trend has the online travel agencies bracing for the possibility that the portals could one day evolve into full-fledged competitors.
2005-11-06	A Journey to the Center of Yahoo	I HAVE never known how to think about Yahoo. I often turn to it for movie listings and driving maps. I have joined numerous Yahoo-based discussion groups, in which I read and occasionally write messages about various recreational interests. Of the more than 400 million Yahoo e-mail accounts worldwide, one belongs to me. But while I know that eBay is at heart an auction site and Amazon.com a retailer, I have not been sure what Yahoo ''is'' -- apart, of course, from a company with a $53 billion market value and weekly revenue of more than $90 million, whose sites make up the largest single presence on the Internet and, according to company officials, account for 13 percent of all page views.
2005-11-03	Big Media a Tough Sell to Jittery Investors	The media moguls are busier than ever. In the last few months, Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman, has announced a series of Web deals including the purchase of Myspace.com, a social networking site. Time Warner is in talks to sell a stake in a suddenly hot AOL. Walt Disney, meanwhile, agreed to shake up its business model and distribute some of its television shows on the latest Apple iPod. Viacom is splitting itself in two. And Comcast announced a deal with Time Warner and other cable operators yesterday to add Sprint cellular service to its range of video, voice and high-speed Internet services.
2005-11-02	Microsoft to Offer Web Services, Competing With Google and Yahoo	Microsoft introduced on Tuesday two new advertising-supported Web services, Windows Live and Office Live, as a direct response to the formidable challenges posed by its major competitors, Google and Yahoo. The new online initiatives will deliver services to businesses and consumers directly via the Web, in many cases, without the need to download the applications to a computer. As such, they are an important step in extending Microsoft's reach beyond the desktop PC to smart phones and other Internet-connected devices.
2005-10-31	Newspaper Ad Circulars Find Their Way Online	YOU could argue that reading a newspaper online is much like reading one offline, but one thing is unmistakably missing from the Web: when you log on, an advertising circular does not fall into your lap. Until now, that is. Gannett, one of the nation's biggest newspaper publishers, said it would introduce a new service on its newspaper Web sites next month that displays banner ads that readers can expand into a virtual version of the weekly local circulars so familiar to offline newspaper readers.
2005-10-30	From Your Living Room to the World, Via Podcast	WHEN Kim Maffin learned that she had multiple sclerosis about a year ago, she decided to use a new technology to reach out to others coping with the disease. She started making podcasts -- recorded audio programs that people can download from the Internet and hear on their computers or MP3 players. From her home near Vancouver, British Columbia, she spoke about her devastating disease into a microphone, connected to her computer, and then posted her thoughts on the Internet. Since then, thousands of people have listened to that first podcast and many others she has made about her disease and related issues, and she now interviews others as part of her program. ''There's no reason I have the disease, and no cure for it,'' she said. ''As it turned out, that situation spoke to a large community of people.''
2005-10-24	To Go Global, Do You Ignore Censorship?	IT'S bad enough when newspaper editorials, Western human rights groups and ordinary American customers condemn your company for bowing to the Chinese dictatorship and contributing to oppression. But when the outrage begins rising, at great personal risk, from dissident voices trapped inside that dictatorship, well, that has to hurt. Or not.
2005-10-21	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Wednesday about Yahoo's quarterly earnings misstated its total advertising revenue for the quarter. It was $1.16 billion, not million.
2005-10-19	Yahoo Reports Revenue Gains Bolstered by Online Ads	Yahoo reported yesterday that it had brisk growth in its third-quarter revenue from online advertising and fees from its broadening relations with providers of high-speed Internet service. But Yahoo's performance in the fastest-growing Internet market -- Web search -- continued to lag behind that of Google.
2005-10-18	Yahoo to Offer Portal Service To BellSouth	BellSouth, the nation's third-largest phone company, said yesterday that it would offer customers of its high-speed Internet service a free Internet portal developed in conjunction with Yahoo. The announcement follows similar deals Yahoo has struck with Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which are fighting with cable companies for high-speed Internet customers.
2005-10-12	Messaging Agreement Expected by 2 Rivals	Microsoft and Yahoo plan to announce Wednesday that their competing instant messaging systems will interconnect, making it possible for users to send messages between the previously incompatible systems, according to a person involved in the announcement. Until now the major instant messaging systems have been isolated from each other. Time Warner's America Online service has the dominant share of the instant messaging market, with MSN Messenger from Microsoft and Yahoo Instant Messenger ranked second and third.
2005-10-06	Smaller Video Producers Seek Audiences on Net	In 1999, ''The Blair Witch Project'' became one of the most profitable low-budget movies of all time through word-of-mouth promotion helped along by a mysterious little Web site that the film's creators put up. Now Dan Myrick, the movie's co-director, is turning to the Internet, not just for marketing, but to deliver a whole series called ''The Strand of Venice,'' a moody drama set in Venice, Calif.
2005-10-03	In Challenge To Google, Yahoo Will Scan Books	An unusual alliance of corporations, nonprofit groups and universities plans to announce today an ambitious plan to digitize hundreds of thousands of books over the next several years and put them on the Internet, with the full text accessible to anyone. The effort is being led by Yahoo, which appears to be taking direct aim at a similar project announced by its archrival, Google, whose own program to create searchable digital copies of entire collections at leading research libraries has run into a series of challenges since it was announced nine months ago.
2005-09-27	How Many Pages in Google? Take a Guess	In the bitter war of words between Google and Yahoo over search-engine index size, Google has decided to give its latest answer in the form of a question. The company said yesterday that it had phased in a larger index over the last four weeks. But rather than directly proclaiming that it had surpassed its archrival Yahoo, which last month claimed index supremacy, Google said it would ask Web surfers to decide for themselves.
2005-09-26	Microsoft Plans to Sell Search Ads Of Its Own	The Microsoft Corporation will unveil today its own system for selling Web advertising as it struggles to compete with Google and Yahoo in the expanding Web search business. The system, to be used by MSN, is meant to improve on those of Microsoft's rivals by allowing marketers to aim ads on Web search pages to users based on their sex, age or location. The move is part of Microsoft's broad response to the threat from Google, which is using its powerful advertising sales network to support an expanding range of free software products and Internet services. Last week, Microsoft announced a broad reorganization that placed MSN in the same group as its Windows operating system, indicating that it saw software delivered over the Internet -- and possibly paid for through advertising -- as central to its future.
2005-09-24	It's Not TV, It's Yahoo; An Ex-ABC Impresario Aims to Build the Studio of the Future	As Discovery orbited the Earth in early August, millions of people visited Yahoo, which runs the most popular news site on the Internet, to see the nail-biting conclusion to the troubled shuttle mission. Could NASA find a way to bring the astronauts home safely? Despite the drama and the huge number of people flocking to the site, Lloyd Braun, the television impresario hired last year to oversee Yahoo's media operation, was not satisfied. All Yahoo was offering its users, Mr. Braun fumed, was a white page filled with links to other sites on the Web.
2005-09-18	Building the Great Firewall of China, With Foreign Help	In April 2004, a few weeks before the 15th anniversary of Beijing's massacre of protesters in Tiananmen Square, the top-ranking staff members of The Contemporary Business News in Hunan were called into a meeting. An editor read a message from the Communist Party's propaganda department warning that protests or media coverage of the anniversary would not be tolerated as June 4 approached. Though the message was routine, the reporters were warned not to take notes. But Shi Tao, one of the journalists, did. He e-mailed them to a Chinese dissident in America, who posted them on the Web. A few months later, Mr. Shi was arrested. This April, he was given 10 years in prison, a sentence the judge called lenient, for disseminating state secrets abroad.
2005-09-16	Microsoft Said to Be in Talks on Forming Link to AOL	Microsoft and Time Warner have explored a variety of possible combinations of the MSN Internet portal with the America Online operation of Time Warner, including a merger of the two into a new company that would be jointly owned, according to several people involved in the talks. The discussions were initiated by Microsoft, which has Google, its new archrival, clearly in its sights. Microsoft is trying to focus its Internet operations on its developing Web search product rather than its Web portal and Internet access business, which it no longer sees as strategically important.
2005-09-12	Search Engines Set Out to Find Missing Persons	Scores of bulletin boards aimed at finding missing persons have popped up on the Internet since Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, and two companies have built specialized search engines to help scour them. Lycos, the 10-year-old search company based in Waltham, Mass., searches at least 20 bulletin boards and missing persons Web sites every four hours to capture data for its service (lycos.com/katrina), while Yahoo retrieves information every hour from 15 large sites and many smaller ones for its engine (news.yahoo.com/katrinahelp).
2005-09-12	Yahoo Hires Journalist To Report On Wars	Yahoo, in its first big move into original online video programming, is betting that war and conflict will lure new viewers. Lloyd Braun, the former chairman of ABC's entertainment group who now oversees Yahoo's expanded media group in Santa Monica, has hired Kevin Sites, a veteran television correspondent, to produce a multimedia Web site that will report on wars around the world.
2005-09-08	Yahoo Role Documented in Chinese Trial	Yahoo, the Internet search company, provided information last year that helped authorities in China convict a Chinese journalist for leaking state secrets to a foreign Web site, court documents show. The journalist, Shi Tao, was sentenced to 10 years in prison this June for sending to a Chinese-language Web site based in New York an anonymous posting that authorities said contained state secrets. His posting summarized a communication from Communist Party authorities to media outlets around the country.
2005-09-01	How to Make Phone Calls Without a Telephone	Internet telephone service is well on its way into the mainstream. Companies like Vonage, using a technology called voice over Internet protocol, or VoIP, offer cheap long-distance rates and features not found with conventional phone service. Cable giants, too, are taking Internet phones to the masses.
2005-08-22	At Comedy Central, the Roast Is Pulling Rank	Last week, the No. 1 downloaded image from Yahoo images was one of Pamela Anderson from a special roast of her, televised by Comedy Central. The one-and-a-half-hour special, which was shown on Sunday, Aug. 14, attracted 4.3 million viewers. It was also the No. 1 rated show on cable television in the 10 p.m. Sunday night slot for viewers 18-49, according to Nielsen. The previous roasts of comedians Denis Leary and Jeff Foxworthy (the latter had an audience of 6.2 million viewers) have turned roasts into another successful format for Comedy Central and possibly another profit center, as well. There is so much curiosity about jokes cut by the network's censors that Comedy Central is currently negotiating with Ms. Anderson to have the roast released on DVD, which would include extras like backstage interviews and parts of the show deemed too naughty for television.
2005-08-22	Where to Spend $4 Billion? Google Has Plenty of Projects in Mind	In all the speculation that followed the announcement from Google on Thursday that it planned to raise an additional $4 billion by selling stock, no one seemed to recall the space elevator. The elevator -- a fanciful alternative to rocket boosters to reach earth orbit -- is one of the dozens of business ideas that have been considered by the company's wide-eyed founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. It also is one of the ideas that the company's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, has taken pride in keeping ''below the line.''
2005-08-21	Mark Cuban Is Mad (Again). But Why?	MARK CUBAN, the entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, has a reputation for screaming like a deranged fan from the sidelines during games. He has been fined more than $1 million by the National Basketball Association for his antics since he bought the team five years ago. Now, Mr. Cuban, who became a billionaire by selling Broadcasting.com to Yahoo in 1999, has focused his infamous bark on a corporate boardroom. The target of his anger is the board of a small Internet company called Register.com, which sells domain names (for example, yourcompany.com) to people and small businesses. He may deserve the Wall Street equivalent of a technical foul for his latest outburst.
2005-08-15	Popular Demand	Google, which still captures the bulk of Internet searches, is now taking aim at local search -- a service akin to yellow pages listings, but with Web links, user reviews and maps. Within the local search category, Yahoo commanded more than four times the number of site visits as Google in July. But between February and July, Google's share of the local search market grew 61 percent, compared with Yahoo's 14 percent growth.
2005-08-15	In Silicon Valley, a Debate Over the Size of the Web	How big is the World Wide Web? Many Internet engineers consider that query one of those imponderable philosophical questions, like how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. But the question about the size of the Web came under intense debate last week after Yahoo announced at an Internet search engine conference in Santa Clara, Calif., that its search engine index -- an accounting of the number of documents that can be located from its databases -- had reached 19.2 billion.
2005-08-15	New Partner For Yahoo Is a Master At Selling	Everything you hear about Jack Ma is improbable. But today, he looks like one of China's smartest high-tech entrepreneurs. Yahoo's far-reaching deal with him on Thursday has turned his company, Alibaba.com, into the largest online operation in China, where Internet use is growing at an explosive pace.
2005-08-09	Yahoo Said to Be in Talks With China E-Commerce Company	Yahoo, one of the world's biggest Internet companies, is in negotiations to acquire a stake in Alibaba.com, China's largest e-commerce company, several people involved in China's financial industry, said Monday. The companies have held discussions for months, and it is still unclear whether they will reach an agreement soon, these people say. The deal could be one of the largest foreign investments in a Chinese technology company, and would pose a strong challenge for the online auction giant eBay, which has been stepping up its presence in China.
2005-08-07	Britney to Rent, Lease or Buy	THE Internet has been described, by enthusiasts, as a global conversation, a giant encyclopedia or a 24-hour news service -- and by detractors as the world's most technologically advanced time waster. What peeves record-company executives, however, is how many people see it as a free music store. A Supreme Court decision at the end of June, however, may eventually put an ''Out of Business'' sign on that store. In MGM Studios v. Grokster, the court found that the makers of software like Grokster, which lets Internet users freely browse and copy songs from one another, can be sued for their role in encouraging copyright infringement. The record companies' lawyers now have a green light to try to shut down the file-swapping services.
2005-08-04	Yahoo Introduces Search Service for Music	Hankering for a little yodeling? Yahoo has introduced a test version of a new search service that it claims can comb through 50 million music, voice and other audio files. Yahoo is hardly the first search engine to offer audio search. Lycos, Singingfish from AOL and even AltaVista, which Yahoo bought, offer search engines that can seek out audio files.
2005-08-03	Yahoo to Start Tests Of Ads on Blog Sites	Call it the battle of the blogs. Yahoo is testing a system that will let it place ads on Web sites of bloggers and other small- and medium-size publishers, a market that was created and is dominated by Google. Yahoo will invite 2,000 sites to take part in the test, beginning today, and will open the system to blogs and other publishers by the end of the year.
2005-07-31	I Screen, You Screen	IT'S hard to remember now, but there was a time when MTV was new -- an upstart with barely enough clips to fill its airtime, using ''I Want My MTV!'' commercials to urge local providers to take notice. The viewing experience was unlike any before it: almost exclusively music videos, a strange new medium of three-minute units and an uncharted arena of artistic and commercial opportunities. Back then, the venue and the content seemed so perfectly suited that it was hard to imagine one without the other. Watching the network was like being witness to some media-age wedding. And together, the new medium and the new genre rewrote the rules of both visual culture and music marketing.
2005-07-28	Yahoo Is Wooing I.B.M. Technical Talent	Yahoo plans to announce Thursday that it is recruiting scientists who pioneered an advanced search-engine technology at I.B.M.'s Silicon Valley research laboratory. Beginning in the mid-1990's, the researchers at I.B.M. spent several years developing an Internet search engine, called Clever, employing a series of algorithms to improve the quality of the retrieval results. While that project has concluded, the I.B.M. researchers have continued other work in the field.
2005-07-22	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Wednesday about Yahoo's second-quarter financial results misstated the share of Internet searches conducted on Yahoo. It is 21 percent, not 12 percent.
2005-07-20	Yahoo Misses One Target; Shares Drop	Yahoo, the rapidly growing Internet site, may be struggling to keep up with the even faster growth of its rival Google, but it owns a substantial consolation prize: a large number of Google shares. Yesterday, Yahoo said it earned $755 million in the second quarter and $563 million of that came from gains in selling about $1 billion in Google shares that it received in an earlier business deal and the settlement of a patent suit last year.
2005-07-18	Marrying Maps to Data for a New Web Service	In 1991, David Gelernter, a computer scientist at Yale, proposed using software to create a computer simulation of the physical world, making it possible to map everything from traffic flow and building layouts to sales and currency data on a computer screen. Mr. Gelernter's idea came a step closer to reality in the last few weeks when both Google and Yahoo published documentation making it significantly easier for programmers to link virtually any kind of Internet data to Web-based maps and, in Google's case, satellite imagery.
2005-06-02	A Failed TV Show Attempts New Life as a Yahoo Webcast	In two brief runs on broadcast television, the live-concert show ''Pepsi Smash'' drew only a modest audience, but Yahoo is betting that putting the program online will be a boon to its digital music offerings. Yahoo today plans to introduce a section of its Web site housing a redesigned version of ''Smash,'' which as a program on the WB network attracted an average of just 1.3 million viewers in eight episodes last summer. Yahoo and Pepsi are reviving the show as a collection of video segments on the Web, with plans to serve up digital streams of live performances from Coldplay, Kanye West and Gwen Stefani, along with new clips designed for short-attention-span online viewing.
2005-06-02	Loosing Google's Lock on the Past	IN the winter of 1996, back when I was a brunette who wore sensible shoes, a photographer snapped my picture during a rehearsal for a college musical. The production mattered; eating and sleeping did not. The resulting portrait showed a pasty, gaunt girl being swallowed by a XXX-large T-shirt. The only thing more unfortunate than the photo is that nearly a decade after it was taken -- a decade in which I became a blonde and graduated to stilettos -- it is still the definitive image of me on the World Wide Web, the one that pops up every time my name is entered in a Google search. It even has the dubious distinction of being in the top 10 hits in a list of several hundred, most of them articles I have written.
2005-05-23	Smartest Guys Well Outside Of Hollywood	FILM buffs have never had more options -- DVD's, video-on-demand and myriad cable movie channels. But there is one choice that has not become easier: seeing a movie in the theater on the day it is released. For that, the Star Wars pilgrim who must know how the series ends -- or begins, as the case may be -- still has to schlep to the multiplex, wait in line and then fight for a seat. Hollywood is hooked on the big opening weekend, but two very wealthy young men would like to break that habit. Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner, who timed the market nicely when they sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in 1999, have created 2929 Entertainment, which will make, distribute and show films digitally -- that is, without using actual film. And instead of using a theatrical release to build a market for DVD and cable broadcast, 2929 plans to release movies in any format you want to see them, on the same day. Its documentary ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room'' was released in theaters and for broadcast at the same time.
2005-05-23	With Its Home Page, Google Could Get a Bit Closer to Its Users	WILL Internet users get personal with Google? The company began testing a service last week that lets users build a customized Google home page filled with news, stock quotes and other features that crowd similar pages on popular portals like Yahoo and MSN.
2005-05-20	Google Moves To Challenge Web Portals	The expanse of white space at the bottom of Google's main Web page, possibly the most valuable undeveloped real estate in cyberspace, is about to be subdivided. Moving more directly into competition with portals like Yahoo, MSN and AOL, the search company today unveiled a feature that allows users to personalize the Google home page with features they use frequently, like stock quotes, news and e-mail.
2005-05-19	A New Spin On a Palmtop (Or Inside It)	FOR several years, technology pundits have predicted the death of the palmtop computer. ''This is the cellphone age,'' they say. ''Who's going to carry around a separate gadget just to look up names and numbers?'' But for the same several years, PalmOne (formerly Palm Computing) has had the same answer: ''We're not dead yet!''
2005-05-12	Yahoo's new music service will cost about a third of what similar services charge. Can it earn a profit?	THE announcement by Yahoo on Tuesday that it is starting a discount online subscription music service sent competitors in the business reeling. Shares of RealNetworks plunged 21 percent yesterday to close at $5.76, while Napster fell nearly 27 percent to close at $4.65. Apple Computer, whose iTunes music service has a 70 percent share of the online music market, declined 2 percent, closing at $35.61.
2005-05-09	Your Internet Search Results, in the Round	For decades, computer researchers have experimented with the idea of displaying textual information in visual maps, but the concept has been slow to find practical applications. Now, one of the pioneering companies in the field is hoping that by making its software available as part of a standard Web browser it will be able to wean surfers away from the simple ranked lists of search results offered by Google and Yahoo.
2005-05-09	Skeptics Take Another Look At Social Sites	There was a time when David Sze, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners, could be counted among those skeptical of the millions of dollars being poured into Internet companies that were creating online communities to foster business and social contacts. ''Basically, it reminded us a lot of what we saw in the late 1990's,'' Mr. Sze said of the first rush of investment in social networking ventures in 2003. ''It was, 'Let's hope some users come and if they do, we'll figure out how to turn that into a business.' We didn't see a real business model there.''
2005-05-02	At Amazon.com, Growth Comes Ahead of Profit	Bad news is relative if you're an investor in the online retail giant Amazon.com. Last Tuesday, Amazon reported its quarterly earnings after the close of the markets. In its three previous reports, Amazon presented its numbers to Wall Street and then watched its stock tumble between 12 percent and 15 percent over the next 24 hours.
2005-05-02	Search engines like Google and Yahoo have it so good that competitors for ad dollars are making sales for them.	CONSIDER this somewhat strange development: search engines like Google and Yahoo have become so proficient at attracting advertising that even competitors, like newspapers and yellow pages publishers, are now selling ads on their behalf. Newspapers like The Houston Chronicle, which is owned by the Hearst Corporation, and yellow pages publishers like the BellSouth Corporation and SBC Communications have recently turned themselves into de facto agents for the search engines in the small-business market, where the Internet companies have had limited success.
2005-04-28	Remember Where You Looked (Even if You Didn't Find It)	Yahoo, Google and Microsoft have been in a space race for search innovation, and the latest frontier is search memory. Yahoo added several features to its search ability this week, including an archive of previous searches and the ability to share these search histories with others. The new service, My Web, is a social bookmarks manager, clipping service and blogging tool wrapped into one. Users can save a copy of any Web page in a storage area and find that page instantly by searching My Web. The pages can then be categorized and shared with others.
2005-04-26	Newspapers Find National Ads a Tough Sell	Mark DiMassimo, an advertising executive in New York, recently heard from a major client who decided to pull back on advertising in nationally circulated newspapers. The company's executives wanted to try a more targeted local-newspaper approach -- inspired, perhaps, by the narrowly focused ads proliferating online. ''One day they woke up and said, 'I'm sure some of this advertising is working, but I don't know how to tell if any of it is,''' said Mr. DiMassimo, chief executive and creative director at his own agency.
2005-04-24	Are Technology Stocks About to Lose the Blues?	POSITIVE earnings news from Intel, Yahoo and Nokia prompted bursts of buying last week in long-depressed technology shares. Is this the start of a sustainable rally? Or, as Friday's sell-off may suggest, just a blip on technology's dismal long-term performance charts? Wall Street has been bearish on technology for so long that it has been easy to overlook the few stubborn bulls who have challenged the consensus. For them, the pummeling of tech shares -- which even after last week's modest net gains are down roughly 11 percent for the year, and more than 60 percent since they peaked in March 2000 -- had gone too far, creating attractive investment opportunities. Walter C. Price Jr., co-manager of the Wells Fargo Specialized Technology fund, predicts a spectacular run-up. ''My target for the Nasdaq for two years is 3,500,'' Mr. Price said. The Nasdaq closed on Friday at 1,932.19.
2005-04-21	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Yahoo Japan's Profit Rises	Japan's largest Internet portal company, the Yahoo Japan Corporation, said its profit rose 34 percent, to 10.32 billion yen ($97 million), in the quarter ended March 31, driven by growth in advertising revenue and its online auction business. Yahoo Japan said its revenue rose 58 percent, to 35.8 billion yen. The Softbank Corporation, one of Japan's biggest Internet service providers, owns 42 percent of Yahoo Japan; Yahoo of the United States owns a 33.5 percent stake. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2005-04-20	Yahoo Gains Users and Sales As Profit Soars	Yahoo, the big Internet portal, said yesterday that its profit doubled in the first quarter, as its audience grew rapidly and advertising sales grew even faster. Yahoo reported that 372 million people visited its network of sites in the quarter, up 36 percent from a year ago. Yahoo asserts that 13 percent of time spent online is spent on its search, e-mail and other services.
2005-04-14	Livedoor and Fuji TV in Talks	The Japanese Internet start-up Livedoor and the Fuji Television Network are discussing a possible alliance, signaling that a contentious two-month struggle for control of a Tokyo radio broadcaster may end amicably. The two companies have been locked in a battle for the radio company, the Nippon Broadcasting System, which is an affiliate of Fuji TV, Japan's biggest private television network. Livedoor, an Internet services and portal company, stunned Japan's investment community by buying up more than half the shares in the radio broadcaster in the last two months, dislodging Fuji TV as Nippon Broadcasting's largest shareholder.
2005-04-02	Google Doubling Storage on Free E-Mail Service	Google Inc., the Internet search engine company, is doubling the amount of storage offered on its e-mail service and plans to remove limits on message capacity as it competes for users with Yahoo Inc. Users of Google's service will be able to store two gigabytes of e-mail messages, double the storage previously offered, the director of the company's e-mail group, Georges Harik, said. One gigabyte, or 1,024 megabytes, is roughly equivalent to the content in 32 feet of shelves filled with books.
2005-03-28	So far, there's a truce between the big job search boards and new employment sites that scan the big boards' listings.	OVER the last year, more people have turned to sites like Shopping.com and Kayak.com to avoid the hassle of clicking around to find travel or shopping bargains. Now a handful of new companies are lining up to provide similar services for job seekers. While the big search engines refine their more generalized search approach, companies like Indeed.com, SimplyHired.com and WorkZoo have in recent weeks introduced services that scan both well-known and obscure employment boards on the job seeker's behalf. In doing so, these companies may earn praise from Internet users, analysts said, even if Monster, CareerBuilder and Yahoo's HotJobs cannot determine if they are friends or foes.
2005-03-17	Right Name, Wrong E-Mail In-Box	LAST fall, David A. Green was looking forward to his new job at a Manhattan real estate brokerage. Finally, he would be able to shed the e-mail confusion that plagued him because of the two other David Greens at his company. No such luck. At his new company, Cushman & Wakefield, there was yet another David Green. And that Mr. Green already held the coveted e-mail name David--Green, following the company's convention for e-mail addresses.
2005-03-16	Microsoft Preparing Challenge To Google and Yahoo for Ads	Microsoft is expected to offer a first look today at some features of a new advertising system on the MSN search engine, part of the company's effort to match the success of Google in the paid Internet search business. The service, called MSN adCenter, is yet to be tested, but executives say it could allow Microsoft to catch up to the top two Web search engines, Google and Yahoo, in search-based advertising by creating a system with broader scope.
2005-03-16	Technology Briefing | Services: Yahoo Plans Social Network Product	Yahoo will announce today a new service called Yahoo 360 that will let users create discrete, and private, social networks that allow friends to share such things as photographs, restaurant reviews and lists of favorite songs. Friends can read one another's blogs, peruse other musings and sift through photo albums, but only after a user gives permission. The service will go live on March 29, said Julie Herendeen, the Yahoo vice president overseeing Yahoo 360, but will be available only to Yahoo users who are invited to test it. Gary Rivlin (NYT)
2005-03-15	Technology Briefing | Services: Blackberry Introduces New Messaging Options	The BlackBerry maker Research in Motion is broadening its menu of instant-messaging options. New services for the hand-held communications device include instant messaging offerings from Yahoo and the America Online unit of Time Warner, the companies announced yesterday in conjunction with the CTIA Wireless show in New Orleans. Research in Motion also announced software deals with Sybase and High Tech Computer. The BlackBerry will be preloaded with Yahoo's software ''in the coming months,'' the companies said, without being more specific. Yahoo Messenger users will have full wireless access to their contacts and be able to carry on multiple chat sessions. Currently, BlackBerry users can obtain access to Yahoo offerings like search, news and sports updates, depending on availability through phone carriers. Research in Motion is also working with America Online to include AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ services on the BlackBerry, besides offering AOL's mobile mail service. BlackBerry users will get access to their AOL Buddy List feature or ICQ contact list for chatting on both networks. No schedule was given for when the services would be available. Two years ago, AOL ended a deal with Research in Motion in which the two companies offered a co-branded wireless messaging device. Shortly after that, Research in Motion began equipping the BlackBerry with instant-messaging software from I.B.M.'s Lotus division.
2005-03-10	Search Engines Build a Better Mousetrap	GOOGLE has so firmly staked out its place as the Internet search-engine leader that it has even earned a place as a verb in the English lexicon. Paradoxically, because of its very popularity, there may be no better time to try something different.
2005-03-10	Making an Easy Task, Instant Messaging, Even Easier	Instant messaging is a bit more portable and affordable with K-Byte's Zipit Wireless Messenger. Sized to slip into the baggy pockets of cargo pants, the device's lithium-ion battery will provide power for about six hours. Priced at $100, Zipit offers a convenient solution to keeping teenagers from tying up the family phone or PC. The device's highlights include a four-inch, 320-by-240-pixel monochrome screen and a qwerty keyboard. In addition, there is something it lacks: a service fee. Because Zipit uses the Internet, instant messaging is free. Compared with other communicators, like AT&T's Ogo, Zipit owners incur no fees other than connection charges at some hot spots. The manufacturer's Web site (zipitwireless.com) offers a locator based on ZIP codes.
2005-02-25	Technology Briefing | Services: AOL Starts Search Function To Aid Ad Sales	America Online yesterday introduced a Web-search function that gives users results linked to their geographic area, attempting to tap an advertising market dominated by Google and Yahoo. The local search tool is available to America Online subscribers and to users of its free-access Web sites, said Jim Riesenbach, senior vice president of America Online's search and directional media division.
2005-02-16	Arts, Briefly; Twice as Much 'Fat Actress'	Those who have been looking forward to Kirstie Alley's comedic role in ''Fat Actress,'' the new seven-episode reality-based series about her experiences as a woman who doesn't meet Hollywood's age and weight requirements, will have two viewing options when the first episode is shown next month. Showtime Networks announced yesterday that it would team with Yahoo to stream the episode simultaneously with the New York premiere on March 7 at 10 p.m. This will be the first time Yahoo has introduced a full television show, and the first time a show will be available free on the Internet. (The WB network presented ''Jack and Bobby'' to AOL's paying membership in September.) ''I think it's the widest reach for a complete television program for anyone who can type Yahoo.com and has the access to the Internet,'' said Showtime's president of entertainment, Robert Greenblatt. ''They can't download it, but they can stream it.'' CATHERINE BILLEY
2005-02-08	About.com, Primedia's Web Venture, Is for Sale	Primedia, the publishing company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, has put the Web site About.com on the block, and five companies plan to bid on it, according to executives close to the auction. Final bids are due today, and the asking price is $350 million to $500 million, they said.
2005-02-01	Microsoft Introduces Its Own Search Service	Two years after saying it planned to enter the battle of Internet search engines, Microsoft is introducing its homegrown search technology to the users of its MSN service and Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft has offered Web search services for years, but until today it used underlying technology provided by Yahoo.
2005-02-01	Law Barring Junk E-Mail Allows a Flood Instead	A year after a sweeping federal antispam law went into effect, there is more junk e-mail on the Internet than ever, and Levon Gillespie, according to Microsoft, is one reason. Lawyers for the company seemed well on the way to shutting down Mr. Gillespie last September after he agreed to meet them at a Starbucks in Los Angeles near the University of Southern California. There they served him a court summons and a lawsuit accusing him, his Web site and 50 unnamed customers of violating state and federal law -- including the year-old federal Can Spam Act -- by flooding Microsoft's internal and customer e-mail networks with illegal spam, among other charges.
2005-01-31	Search Sites Play a Game of Constant Catch-Up	Last Monday, Google representatives called analysts and reporters to trumpet a new service that searches the transcripts of television broadcasts. Yahoo, Google's rival, got wind of the announcement and within hours, its publicity machine had bolted into action to say it had a similar service in the works. Perhaps the fiercest competition on the Internet these days is among sites offering new ways to search through more information. Yahoo and Microsoft each have hundreds of engineers trying to challenge Google's leadership, and dozens of minor players are trying to find ways of getting their services noticed. A9, Amazon.com's search service, recently sent vans with digital cameras onto the streets of some cities to take pictures of businesses. The photos were later displayed alongside telephone numbers in A9's phone directory.
2005-01-25	Google and Yahoo Are Extending Search Ability to TV Programs	Google and Yahoo are introducing services that will let users search through television programs based on words spoken on the air. The services will look for keywords in the closed captioning information that is encoded in many programs, mainly as an aid to deaf viewers. Google's service, scheduled to be introduced today, does not actually permit people to watch the video on their computers. Instead, it presents them with short excerpts of program transcripts with text matching their search queries and a single image from the program. Google records TV programs for use in the service.
2005-01-24	Friendster, Love And Money; Users Lose the Thrill Of 'Social Networking'	Fifteen months ago, Friendster enjoyed the kind of enviable status that Silicon Valley start-ups dream of: A-list investors and millions of users flocking to its Web site to browse profiles posted by friends and friends' friends, in search of dates or playmates. So great was the buzz surrounding the company in the second half of 2003 that Friendster, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., helped define a hot new facet of the Internet dubbed ''social networking.''
2005-01-21	AOL Offers a More Refined Search Engine	America Online introduced a new Internet search engine yesterday, part of an effort to gain a larger share of the online advertising market. The service, called AOL Search, will sort results by geography and topic and offer a suggestion tool, the company, a Time Warner unit, said. AOL has licensed technology from Vivisimo, a closely held software company.
2005-01-19	Yahoo's Profit Soars in Quarter On Ad Spending and Investments	After announcing a partnership with Verizon Communications to develop a portal for high-speed Internet services on Monday, Yahoo Inc. posted strong fourth-quarter profits yesterday, driven largely by strong advertising sales and a sizable windfall from sales of an investment. The company said it planned to extend its broadband presence in 2005 and to continue its international expansion through acquisitions of Web portal and search sites. The company drew 119 million unique visitors in December, more than any other site, according to comScore Networks, an Internet research firm.
2005-01-18	Verizon and Yahoo Team Up to Offer Broadband Service	Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications company, said yesterday that it planned to work with Yahoo, the Internet search engine, to introduce a portal for its high-speed Internet service. The venture comes as competition for broadband customers between telephone and cable companies continues to heat up. Yahoo is also looking for ways to attract visitors to its Web sites and reduce its reliance on advertising revenue.
2005-01-13	Advertisers on Google Are Told to Keep It Proper	IN the haphazard world of instant messaging and dashed-off e-mail messages, where ''kk'' isn't a typographical mistake but just the latest bit of Internet slang (it stands for kays, or O.K.), does anyone really care about style and grammar anymore? Google does. Taking the stance that unorthodox usage and punctuation and slang create a less straightforward searching experience, Google's AdWords division, which is responsible for the contextual ads that appear alongside search results, insists on standard English and punctilious punctuation. Cater to teenagers hooked on text messaging? This is a world with no ''dealz 4 u.'' To those who say, ''Grammar schmammar, this is advertising, after all,'' Google might suggest: ''Schmammar is not a word. Try 'Forget about grammar' instead.''
2005-01-09	The Call of the Wild, Again, in Internet Funds	IT was a spectacular year for some of the largest Internet stocks. Google's share price doubled after its initial public offering and Yahoo and eBay staged yearlong rallies. Despite these gains, many investors remain wary of mutual funds that focus on the sector -- and for good reason, many analysts say.
2004-12-16	A Distraction as a Deadline Approaches	IT'S deceptive, the way a ringing phone always sounds the same, whether it's someone with jolly news -- a holiday party invitation, say -- or a mother calling to complain that your 7-year-old daughter is spreading rumors about Santa. ''Are you sure it was Clementine?'' I asked. But we both knew I was trying to buy time.
2004-12-10	Technology Briefing | Software: Yahoo To Offer E-Mail And File Search System	Yahoo said yesterday that it would soon offer its users software they can use to comb through their e-mail messages and the files on their desktops. In October, Google introduced a free program that allows users to search their computers in much the same way they search the Web. Microsoft has said it is working on a similar offering. Rather than developing its own search software, Yahoo will offer its users a version of the software package from X1 Technologies, said Jeffrey Weiner, Yahoo's senior vice president for search and marketplace. Yahoo will introduce a beta, or test, version in January. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2004-12-07	Web Guides Improve, but Who's That Puppy?	''MY wife is not a dog.'' I muttered these words to my PC during a recent test of three of the most popular shopping comparison Web sites: Shopzilla, Yahoo Shopping and Shopping.com. I was looking for a red sweater for my wife, Karen, and a digital camera for my son Elias.
2004-11-24	Your Train Will Be Late, She Says Cheerily; Voice of Amtrak Computer Works on Frayed Nerves	Amid long lines and frayed nerves typical during the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend, roughly 600,000 rail travelers nationwide will squeeze on and off trains, with one-third passing through Pennsylvania Station. Through it all Julie will remain unshakably courteous and tirelessly chipper.
2004-11-22	Free or Paid? AOL Will Let Its Two Halves Duke It Out; In a Risky Reversal, An Effort to Cash In On an Online Ad Boom	A year ago, America Online canceled a deal with Sportsline.com to introduce its own sports site with original columnists, a daily video program of sports highlights and a national call-in show on AOL's online radio service. It was all part of the company's broad effort to rebuild its vast online service in hopes of slowing the steady decline of subscribers. The problem was that AOL subscribers did not seem to care.
2004-11-19	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: SBC To Provide Browsers For TV's And Cellphones	SBC Communications said yesterday that Yahoo would produce browsers for cellphones, televisions and other devices that deliver SBC services. With the browsers, SBC wants to present a uniform face for all its products and allow its customers access to services on a variety of devices. Yahoo already provides the browser for SBC's broadband service. Ken Belson (NYT)
2004-11-17	Silicon Valley Aims to Refresh Its Image	Silicon Valley is back, and it's wearing makeup. Or at least its executive luminaries were wearing it on Monday, as the Valley's stars assembled for a series of ''Charlie Rose'' TV interviews whose theme seemed to be that the region is once again buzzworthy -- whether in the guise of old-line silicon mainstays like Intel, newer Web powers like Google or biotech leaders like Genentech.
2004-11-11	Microsoft Unveils Its Internet Search Engine, Quietly	Microsoft rolled out its long-planned response to Google and Yahoo in the Internet search industry on Wednesday, but with an uncharacteristically soft-sell approach. The debut, taking the form of a test site, was a stark contrast to another high-profile introduction the company made nine years ago. That was when Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, all but declared war on Netscape Communications and its Web browser by announcing his company's own browser, Internet Explorer, and proclaiming, ''We are hard core about the Internet.''
2004-11-11	Technology Briefing | Services: Softbank First-Half Loss Narrows	The Softbank Corporation, Japan's second-largest provider of high-speed Internet access, said yesterday that its first-half loss narrowed after it added users to its Yahoo BB broadband service. The net loss narrowed to 6.05 billion yen ($57 million), or 17.20 yen a share, in the six months that ended Sept. 30, from 77.3 billion yen, or 229.81 yen a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales gained 35 percent, to 303.7 billion yen from 225.5 billion yen. Softbank's founder, Masayoshi Son, is improving earnings with the help of new subscribers to his company's high-speed Internet services. After acquiring the Japan Telecom Company to offer fixed-line phone services, Mr. Son is trying to enter Japan's $73 billion mobile phone market. He has also offered to buy a professional baseball team. Softbank's operating loss, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, totaled 6.79 billion yen in the first half, narrowing from 39.4 billion yen a year earlier. In the second quarter, Softbank posted net income of 11.8 billion yen, compared with a 42.6 billion yen net loss in the same period a year earlier.
2004-11-09	AOL's Chief Revamps It, With an Eye On Yahoo	Jonathan F. Miller, the chief executive of America Online, unveiled a broad reorganization that cements his power over the company and emphasizes his new strategy of taking on Yahoo as a free Web portal. The reorganization creates three new business units: content and advertising, Internet access and fee-based services.
2004-11-03	AOL Is Said to Plan 700 Layoffs	America Online, the country's leading Internet service, is preparing to lay off as many as 700 of its 13,000 employees in the United States, according to an executive knowledgeable about its plans. AOL, a unit of Time Warner, is continuing to cope with a declining subscriber base and an advertising business that, while rebounding, trails industry leaders like Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN. The layoffs will not be concentrated among any particular department, the executive said, and the exact jobs to be eliminated have not yet been determined. Time Warner is scheduled to report its earnings for the third quarter today and is expected to identify a reorganization charge related to severance and other costs from the planned layoffs, which were first reported by The Washington Post.
2004-11-02	Yahoo Names Media Executive	Lloyd Braun, ousted last year as the chairman of ABC Entertainment, will become head of entertainment and media content for Yahoo, the company announced yesterday. Yahoo called Mr. Braun the right executive to bring a new creative dimension to Yahoo's plans to provide Web users with services in areas including news, sports, health, finance and games, as well as future areas of entertainment.
2004-10-29	Internet Giants File 7 Suits Aimed at Stopping Spam	Four leading Internet service providers announced yesterday that they had filed a new round of lawsuits against senders of junk e-mail, or spam. The suits include the first filed by America Online against spammers who use instant messaging, a practice the online industry calls spimming. AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo and EarthLink filed seven lawsuits in four states under the federal antispam law, which aims at stopping billions of unsolicited electronic messages, many with false headings that mislead consumers or seek to sell products that do not exist.
2004-10-28	MarketWatch, Web News Site, Is Up for Sale	MarketWatch, the owner of a leading financial news site, CBS MarketWatch, is soliciting bids expected to be as much as $400 million for the company, executives involved in the sale process said yesterday. MarketWatch, which quietly put itself on the block early last month, operates one of the few Web sites born in the late 1990's that has survived the bursting of the dot-com bubble amid a torrent of competition from more established news organizations.
2004-10-22	Earnings Soar, and Share Price Follows	Google Inc.'s already soaring stock price rocketed even higher on Thursday after reporting strong growth in its first quarter as a public company, prompting skeptics to again caution against Googlemania getting out of control. Google, the Internet search engine provider, reported that its profit and revenue more than doubled in the first quarter after its initial public offering. The results led its shares, which had closed up $8.89, or 6.33 percent, at $149.38, to continue skyward, jumping another 8.25 percent, to $161.70, in after-hours trading. The price was nearly double the initial offering of $85 a share in mid-August.
2004-10-18	Travel sites want to help you find a cheap trip. But is cost the only factor to consider?	KAYAK.COM and other newly minted companies want to end the traveler's frustration at scanning multiple Web sites to find the cheapest prices for flights, hotels and car rentals. Whether those sites will allow such searches is another matter. Travel search engines take aim at the most headache-inducing task for online shoppers: examining numerous major e-travel agency sites, like Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity, as well as airline, hotel and car rental company sites, to find the best prices. Kayak and its chief competitors, SideStep.com, Mobissimo.com and Yahoo, conduct those searches on their customers' behalf, and highlight the cheapest fare. (Another search site, Qixo.com, charges a fee for bookings.)
2004-10-18	Google Envy Is Fomenting Search Wars	Propelled by Google envy, new players and Internet industry giants are rushing into the online search market, setting off a burst of activity that contrasts sharply with the lull after the dot-com collapse. To fend off its challengers, Google has furiously intensified efforts to add new services to its brand.
2004-10-13	Yahoo Tripled Profits in Quarter, Thanks to Google Shares	Yahoo continued to ride the growth of online advertising in the third quarter, but more than half its profit in the quarter came from the success of its rival Google. Yahoo reported a profit of $253 million in the quarter, nearly three times the figure from a year earlier. Of that, $129 million came from its sale of Google shares during that company's initial public offering and tax breaks associated with the sale.
2004-10-10	Pulling Back a Curtain On Hedge Funds	IT seemed like a good idea. Two Wall Street refugees would set up shop in a dumpy office over an arts store near Silicon Valley. Their plan was to invest money for the superrich, becoming wealthy themselves in the process.
2004-10-07	In a Clamshell, AT&T Delivers A Tool for Text	THE hot trend in cellphones lately, if you haven't noticed, is the communicator: a multitasking device that, thanks to a Thumbelina keyboard, is just as good at e-mail and instant messages as it is at phone calls. (See also Treo; BlackBerry; T-Mobile Sidekick.) Communicators are finding happy homes with people who are blessed with nimble thumbs and generous expense accounts. The goofy part is, of course, that few white-collar business types ever even use the instant-messaging and text-to-phone features. Meanwhile, the people who would really love such features -- 15-to 25-year-olds -- are locked out by the $400 to $500 price tags. (When was the last time you saw a 10th grader hammering away on a BlackBerry?)
2004-10-05	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo To Introduce New Search Service	Today Yahoo will introduce a test version of a service it calls My Yahoo Search, which will let users identify Web pages they want to remember. Users will mark the page by pushing a button in a browser toolbar, and they can annotate the page with a short phrase. Later, users will be able to conduct searches of pages they have marked. The service also lets users identify sites that they want to block from their Web searches. Other search services, such as Ask Jeeves, Looksmart and Amazon.com's A9, have introduced similar personalization features. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2004-09-30	New Company Starts Up A Challenge To Google	Google executives have long conceded that one of their great fears is to be overtaken by a more advanced Internet search technology. Vivisimo, a company founded by three former Carnegie Mellon University computer scientists, is hoping to prove that Google's worries are well founded. Four-year-old Vivisimo plans to start Clusty, a free, consumer search service based on results from Yahoo's Overture engine, Thursday.
2004-09-28	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo To Revise Home Page	Yahoo is preparing to renovate its home page -- Yahoo.com -- and its My Yahoo personalized news and information service. Yahoo.com is the most visited single page on the Internet, with 66 million users in the United States last month. It is mainly getting a cosmetic makeover, which reduces the size of Yahoo's directory of Web sites -- its original service -- and increases the emphasis on Web search and entertainment news. My Yahoo, which was used by 20 million people last month, is undergoing a more radical change that will allow users to put information from more than 150,000 sources on their custom pages. Until now, My Yahoo offered users a choice of news headlines, sports scores and financial information drawn from several hundred sources. These included Yahoo services and companies having business arrangements with Yahoo. Now Yahoo will use emerging technology known as really simple syndication, or R.S.S., a format that allows publishers of Web pages to make their content available to software that can read it and present it in different formats.

2004-09-23	Stock chat on the Internet may be odd, but it's not just noise, a study finds.	TALK is cheap, particularly on the Internet. Stock message boards are a case in point. Every day participants post tens of thousands of tips about which way various stocks are heading. Is any of this worth reading? Recently, two financial economists from the University of British Columbia, Werner Antweiler and Murray Z. Frank, examined the message board phenomenon in a paper entitled ''Is All That Talk Just Noise? The Information Content of Internet Stock Message Boards,'' published in the June 2004 issue of The Journal of Finance.
2004-09-19	Corrections	The Strategies column last Sunday, about a study of initial public offerings, included an erroneous reference to the performance of Yahoo. Although the study's author, Prof. Jay R. Ritter, mentioned that company among those achieving substantial commercial success before they went public, Yahoo had sales of $1.4 million in the 12 months before it did so in 1996 -- less than the $50 million the study used as a threshold for such success.
2004-09-16	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about Yahoo's acquisition of the online Musicmatch service, referred imprecisely to songs that can be played on the Apple iPod. While RealNetworks' online store is the only one besides Apple's to sell songs in the protected iPod format, other companies sell them in the MP3 format, which the player can also use. The article also misspelled the given name of a spokeswoman for Amazon.com, who declined to comment on speculation that her company might want to acquire Napster, a rival to Musicmatch. She is Patty Smith, not Patti.
2004-09-15	Yahoo to Buy Online Music Seller for $160 Million	In a move to expand its role in the online music business, Yahoo announced yesterday that it would buy Musicmatch, a company that sells music online, for $160 million. The move puts Yahoo in direct competition with Apple Computer's iTunes, Microsoft's new music store and RealNetworks in the small but growing market for online downloads of music. Yahoo already has a significant advertiser-supported free music business, with Internet radio and music video channels, along with information and discussion boards about music. The services are based on technology it acquired with Launch Media, which it bought in 2001 for $12 million. Yahoo has also introduced an Internet radio service that offers more choices and better sound quality but charges a fee. But until now, it has not offered users the ability to buy and download songs.
2004-09-13	AOL, home of some avid online shoppers, is adding features to make their browsing and buying easier.	COMPARISON shopping Web sites like Yahoo Shopping, Google's Froogle and Shopping.com are about to face some new competition from an old online player. Next Monday, America Online, the Internet division of Time Warner, will introduce a shopping Web site called In-Store.com to go along with the company's revamped shopping section. It will be AOL's first offering to consumers who want to research products side by side before buying.
2004-09-12	If the Revenue Column Says Zero, Avoid the I.P.O.	INITIAL offerings of commercially successful companies regularly beat benchmarks of similar stocks over the long term. That, at least, is the finding of a new study -- and it runs counter to almost all previous research on initial public offerings. It is surprising that anything new is emerging from I.P.O. research, much less something so at odds with earlier studies. After all, researchers have been scrutinizing the new-issue market for several decades; if an easily defined category of I.P.O.'s could predictably perform better than average, researchers presumably would have discovered it long ago.
2004-08-30	Web Searches	To the Editor: Matthew Hindman and Kenneth Neil Cukier (Op-Ed, Aug. 23) are right to worry that 95 percent of Web searches are conducted by two companies, now both publicly traded.But they are silent about what to do when the search for profit threatens the quality of information.
2004-08-23	More Is Not Necessarily Better	Imagine if one company controlled the card catalog of every library in the world. The influence it would have over what people see, read and discuss would be enormous. Now consider online search engines. Few people realize that 95 percent of all Web searches in the United States are handled by two companies, Google and Yahoo, either directly or through other sites that use their technology. In the case of Google, whose shares started to trade publicly last week, the company holds the world's largest index of Web content, at more than four billion pages, and handles more than 200 million searches a day. The influence of search companies in determining what users worldwide can see and do online is breathtaking.
2004-08-10	Google and Yahoo Settle Dispute Over Search Patent	Google said yesterday that it had settled a long-running patent dispute with its archrival Yahoo, a move that reduces some of the uncertainty surrounding Google's business as it prepares for the public auction of its stock. Google's initial public offering, once seen as a catalyst that could turn the slumping technology stock market around, has been delayed for about a week in the face of both technical snags and increasing investor skepticism. The unconventional auction could still proceed this week or early next week.
2004-08-03	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo To Start New Business Directory	Yahoo is taking its war with Google and Microsoft house to house, or more precisely shop to shop. The big Internet portal will start a public test today of a new service to help users find stores and other resources in a specific neighborhood. The new service is meant to replace Yahoo's existing online Yellow Pages listings with a broader directory that combines information from traditional Yellow Pages directories with the results of searches of the Web and other databases. The site can be seen at beta.local.yahoo.com. In addition, Yahoo will allow users to post ratings and reviews of businesses. For now, Yahoo is giving up some advertising revenue it had earned from its previous Yellow Pages service, on which some businesses paid to appear first on a list of results. The new local service ranks results based on how well they fit a user's query. There will be advertising, however, in which businesses can bid to associate their ad with a certain topic and location. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2004-07-29	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Credit Rating Raised	The credit rating of Yahoo was raised to investment grade yesterday, Standard & Poor's said, because of its successful expansion of its subscription services and projected growth from advertising. Yahoo's rating was raised to BBB- from BB+, the ratings agency said. The action affects about $750 million in debt, it said. Yahoo's previous rating was one level below investment grade. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., will benefit from a surge in sponsored search advertising, or ads placed above and alongside Internet search results, S.&P. said. Yahoo may also be able to grow through acquisitions, like its purchase of the European shopping site Kelkoo earlier this year, the ratings service said. Shares of Yahoo fell 30 cents, to $29.70.
2004-07-27	Latest MyDoom Worm Plagues Search Sites	The latest version of a computer worm known as MyDoom disrupted the Google search site yesterday, the same day that the giant search engine announced a range for its share price in the much-anticipated public auction of its stock. Google and three other major search engines were temporarily affected by searches for e-mail addresses generated by the MyDoom worm, according to security experts. The experts said it was impossible to know whether the attack was timed to Google's announcement because the worm's origins are unknown, but they said a link was highly unlikely.
2004-07-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Yahoo Japan Profit Soars	The Yahoo Japan Corporation, the country's biggest Internet auction operator, said that its fiscal first-quarter profit surged 83 percent on gains from advertising and online sales. Annual profit growth may slow to 49 percent in the quarter. Group net income rose to 8.31 billion yen ($76.5 million) in the three months to June 30, from 4.54 billion yen in the same period a year earlier, according to a company statement. Sales rose 57 percent, to 24.5 billion yen. Yahoo Japan has posted at least nine quarters of profit growth, benefiting as 20 percent of households have connected to broadband high-speed Internet-access services that allow easier online shopping. The chief executive, Masahiro Inoue, said there was still room to grow in Japan given that 80 percent of homes in South Korea have broadband access. Shares of Yahoo Japan, the 13th-largest company in Japan by market capitalization, rose 6 percent to close trading at 920,000 yen ahead of the earnings announcement.
2004-07-19	The MSN Butterfly Begins to Break Free	At an October 2002 gala to introduce Microsoft's MSN 8 Internet service, Bill Gates showed a video of himself wearing a butterfly costume and handing out software for the service. His point was that after seven years of floundering in the Internet access market, Microsoft would do whatever it took to beat its longtime rival America Online. That included pouring $500 million into MSN to match AOL's most popular features and another $300 million into marketing, featuring MSN's butterfly mascot and a concert highlighted by rocker Lenny Kravitz singing ''Fly Away.''
2004-07-16	World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Internet Telecom	The British telecom company BT Group has started offering phone calls, e-mail and Yahoo Inc. instant messaging free over the Internet. The company's 19 million customers can now download free software from the Internet to set up the service, which turns the computer into a telephone, address book and video camera, the company said. Calls from one computer to another, using technology known as voice over Internet protocol, are free; fixed-line or mobile phone calls are charged standard rates. Access charges start at £20 ($37) a month.
2004-07-13	Technology Briefing | Deals: Yahoo Acquiring Oddpost	Yahoo has agreed to buy Oddpost.com, a vendor of online e-mail and news services, for an undisclosed sum. The two companies yesterday confirmed Yahoo's plan to buy Oddpost but disclosed few details; Yahoo is expected to pay close to $30 million for the company. Oddpost's 10 employees, based in San Francisco, will report to Yahoo's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. In a document posted to its Web site, Oddpost told members it would continue to operate existing e-mail accounts, but said the company would focus on helping Yahoo produce a new version of its online e-mail service. Existing Oddpost members will move to Yahoo when its next Web mail update is introduced, according to the document. The announcement did not give a date for the debut of the new Yahoo Mail release. For $30 a year, Oddpost has offered 50 megabytes of online e-mail memory, along with spam filtering tools and daily news aggregation. The service also offers some of the more advanced features of software like Microsoft's Outlook, such as automatic generation of frequently used e-mail addresses as they are typed into new messages.
2004-07-08	Yahoo's Quarterly Earnings Double but Disappoint Investors	Yahoo said yesterday that its profit more than doubled in the second quarter, driven both by acquisitions and a surging online advertising market. But the numbers only matched Wall Street estimates; investors, who had been hoping for much better results, pushed the company's shares down in after-hours trading. In the first quarter, Yahoo's results, buoyed by a rapidly growing market for Internet advertising, were surprisingly strong, and many investors were looking for a repeat in the latest period. But the company did not deliver that and only slightly raised its forecast for the year. Before the results were announced, Yahoo's shares closed at $32.60, down 62 cents, but fell as low as $28.86 after hours.
2004-06-23	4 Rivals Near Agreement on Ways to Fight Spam	Four large Internet service providers agreed yesterday to a partial truce in their battle with one another over potential technology to stop junk e-mail in hopes that they can devote their united energy to fighting spam. More than a year ago the four providers -- America Online, Yahoo, EarthLink and Microsoft -- said that they would work together to create technical standards that could verify the identity of the sender of an e-mail message.
2004-06-21	Old Search Engine, the Library, Tries to Fit Into a Google World	Katarina Maxianova, who received her bachelor's degree in comparative literature from Columbia University in May, took a seminar last year in which the professor assigned two articles from New Left Review magazine. She found one immediately through Google; for the other, she had to trek to the library stacks. ''Everyone in class tried to get those articles online,'' she said, ''and some people didn't even bother to go to the stacks when they couldn't Google them.'' For the last few years, librarians have increasingly seen people use online search sites not to supplement research libraries but to replace them. Yet only recently have librarians stopped lamenting the trend and started working to close the gap between traditional scholarly research and the incomplete, often random results of a Google search.
2004-06-15	Yahoo Expands E-Mail Storage, In Nod to Google	Yahoo will substantially increase the amount of free storage it gives its e-mail customers, in an effort to respond to Google's incursion into e-mail services. For Yahoo, defending its e-mail business is crucial to competing against Google, which has become the leading Web search engine. While free e-mail accounts have display advertising, they are not especially profitable. But they are an important way to build customer loyalty and to direct users to other, more lucrative sections of an Internet service. People spend more time reading their e-mail than doing anything else online.
2004-05-28	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Offers Software To Counter Spyware	Yahoo, the owner of the second-most-used Internet search engine, is offering software to help customers keep their Web surfing private in an attempt to lure users from Google and from the MSN Internet unit of Microsoft. The Yahoo software will help consumers search for and purge their computers of so-called spyware. Spyware programs are downloaded to personal computers without their owners' knowledge. Companies use spyware to monitor Web sites visited, to display advertising and to redirect Web browsers to sites their users did not intend to visit. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is adding the feature to its toolbar, a row of boxes on users' screens that link to the search engine and other functions and also carry the company's logo. Yahoo is trying to persuade more people to install and use its toolbar. Google, the No.1 search engine, based in Mountain View, Calif., and Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., offer toolbars without spyware destroyers. Yahoo shares rose 45 cents to $30.56.
2004-05-15	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Thursday about reading recommendations from three authors of business books misstated the price paid by Yahoo for Yoyodyne, a direct-marketing company founded by one of the authors, Seth Godin. It was $30 million in stock, not $250 million.
2004-05-10	E-Commerce Report; Can online ads increase sales of consumer goods, like soft drinks and pet food? Yahoo says yes, and offers to prove it.	AS good as Internet advertising market has been, there is still a huge hole where consumer goods manufacturers could be. Unlike automakers, banks and movie studios, makers of laundry detergent, soft drinks and toothpaste have proved largely Internet-averse, spending 1.5 percent or less of their total advertising budgets online. Consumer goods companies represented 7 percent of the $7.3 billion spent on online advertising last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. The auto industry spent 21 percent and retailers spent 41 percent.
2004-05-01	Google Poses A Challenge For Usual Ad Outlets	The plan by Google to auction its shares may represent a challenge to Wall Street but the striking success of its Internet advertising business poses perhaps an even greater threat to Madison Avenue. Unlike conventional advertising, to which vast creative effort is devoted to make it funny or pithy or just downright annoying enough to attract attention, an Internet search engine like Google or Yahoo already has access to users looking for something in particular. Companies with a commercial message can easily reach a vast collection of people one by one who are actually interested in what they have to sell.
2004-04-15	Google to Offer Companies Ads That Focus on a Region	In the tit-for-tat battle between Yahoo and Google to gain an edge in tailoring Internet searches to narrow geographic markets, Google plans to announce on Thursday that it will start offering companies the option of local advertising limited to Internet users in select regions. The move follows Yahoo's introduction last month of SmartView, which allowed it to get a jump on Google by creating a service for Web users that permits enhance searches limited to a local area. Google echoed that move days later when it started Google Local, a product that even company executives acknowledge is still a work in progress.
2004-04-08	Yahoo Reports a Surge In Quarterly Earnings And Plans a Stock Split	When Yahoo, the Internet portal company, announced first-quarter financial results yesterday that were far stronger than expected, the canyons of Wall Street seemed to echo with the yodel the company uses in its advertising campaign. Shares of Yahoo rose more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, reaching as high as $53.40 after ending regular trading at $48.35. The company also announced a two-for-one stock split, payable May 11 to shareholders of record as of April 26.
2004-04-05	Subway and Google Try to Split the Screen	On Madison Avenue these days, breaking up is easy to do. Two big advertisers, Subway Restaurants and Yahoo, are introducing commercials that tell stories by splitting the television screen in half vertically. The split-screen spots for Subway, by Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, began Saturday and their counterparts for Yahoo, by Soho Square in New York, part of the WPP Group, are to start appearing today.
2004-04-05	Web Engines Plan to End Online Ads For Gambling	Google and Yahoo, two of the most widely used Web search engines, have decided to stop running advertisements for online casinos, a shift that could thwart the growth of Internet gambling. The move, which the companies said would take effect by the end of April, comes as federal prosecutors are threatening action against American companies that do business with Internet casinos that are based abroad.
2004-04-01	Google Sends A Message To Competitors	Google, the dominant Internet search company, is planning to raise the stakes in its intensifying competition with Yahoo and Microsoft by unveiling a new consumer-oriented e-mail service. The new service, to be named Gmail, is scheduled to be released on Thursday, according to people involved with the plan. It will be ''soft launched,'' they said, in a manner that Google has followed with other features that it has added to its Web site, with little fanfare and presented initially as a long-running test.
2004-03-28	Ideas & Trends: Frontier Justice; On the Web, Vengeance Is Mine (and Mine)	YOU can almost hear the spurs jingling. Self-appointed sheriffs scan eBay and Yahoo auctions looking for fraud. When they find it -- or at least when they think they've found it -- they warn buyers or make outrageously high bids themselves in order to end the auction and prevent potential victims from falling into the trap. Elsewhere, private crusaders cruise Internet chat rooms for pedophiles and report their findings to law enforcement -- or even expose them online. And hackers release programs into cyberspace that repair the damage done by malicious computer viruses.
2004-03-22	E-Commerce Report; Proponents say that the time has come for online radio, and now they hope mainstream advertisers come along.	THE static that has enveloped the Internet radio industry is starting to clear. The protracted legal and regulatory battles involving so-called Webcasters, the recording industry and the federal copyright authorities have dissipated, while the number of consumers who listen to the radio over their computers has risen to the point where the medium should -- according to its proponents, at least -- begin to gain respect from mainstream advertisers.
2004-03-21	For Yahoo, The Search Is Worth The Effort	OVER the last three years, Yahoo, the Web portal and Internet provider, has become a major factor in the Internet search-engine business. As recently as 2000, the company's search revenue amounted to just $400 million, according to an estimate by analysts at Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup. This year, it is likely to exceed $3 billion.
2004-03-11	4 Big Internet Providers File Suits To Stop Leading Senders of Spam	Four major Internet providers announced yesterday that they had filed lawsuits meant to shut a number of leading senders of unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam. The suits, which are seeking monetary damages and injunctions against further mass e-mail messages, are among the first to invoke the new federal antispam law, which went into effect Jan. 1.
2004-03-02	Yahoo to Charge for Guaranteeing a Spot on Its Index	Yahoo said yesterday that it would start charging companies that want to ensure that their Web sites are included in its Web index from which research results are selected. The practice, called ''paid inclusion,'' has long been a part of many search engines including Microsoft's MSN search function and Ask Jeeves. But Google, which last year surged ahead of Yahoo to become the No.1 site for searching on the Internet, disdains the practice as misleading.
2004-02-26	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Arrests Hurt Softbank Shares	Shares of the Softbank Corporation tumbled on news that the police arrested four men on suspicion they tried to extort money from the company after obtaining personal data for as many as 4.6 million subscribers to its Yahoo BB broadband Internet service. Softbank said it was looking into reports of a leak amid concerns about the company's internal controls after it said earlier this year that private information on 242 users of its broadband service had leaked out. The information included addresses, names and telephone numbers.
2004-02-22	The Search Engine That Isn't a Verb, Yet	IN July 2001, three months after Terry S. Semel, the former Warner Brothers studio co-chief, took over as chief executive of Yahoo, he excitedly called a news conference with Sir Howard Stringer, the chairman of the Sony Corporation of America. The past and present movie moguls described in glowing but vague terms a new partnership. Sony would buy some advertising on Yahoo, and Yahoo would help Sony develop a new Web site. ''We're not quite married,'' Sir Howard told reporters, hinting at possible closer ties between the companies in the future. ''But at least we're holding hands.''
2004-02-18	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo To Use Inktomi Software	More than a year after buying Inktomi, a company that makes software for searching the Internet, Yahoo will start using a modified version of that software for its Web searches, starting today. Until now, Yahoo's Web searches were provided by a rival, Google. Yahoo said its Web searching would be fresher and more relevant than Google's. Google said that it had added nearly one billion pages to its Web index for a total of 4.28 billion pages. Yahoo declined to say how many pages are in its index. Yahoo's move is the first shot in what it hopes will be an assault on Google in several search-related areas. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2004-02-14	For Disney, the Best Defense Could Be a Good Offense	The last time Walt Disney came under attack from an unwanted suitor -- a 1984 takeover attempt by the corporate raider Saul Steinberg -- the company fought back with an acquisition of its own. By paying $200 million for the Florida real estate developer Arvida, Disney fattened itself and made it harder for Mr. Steinberg to swallow. Now some investors are wondering if Disney may try that defensive gambit again. Since Comcast announced its unsolicited $54 billion offer for Disney on Wednesday, investors have bid up the shares of several putative targets, including the film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Barry Diller's online services company InterActiveCorp, Steven P. Jobs's Pixar Animation Studios, the Internet company Yahoo, and, most notably, Charles W. Ergen's satellite TV service Echostar. On Wednesday, shares of Echostar quickly jumped $2.25 a share, to over $39.75, before falling back to close the week at $38.93.
2004-02-09	Social Networks: Will Users Pay To Get Friends?	The idea behind ''social networking'' Web sites like Friendster, Tribe.net and LinkedIn is almost the opposite of the old Groucho Marx joke: they attract people who want to join a club eager to have them. But as the popularity of such sites has taken off, the big question for investors in new technologies is whether social networking sites can ever make a lot of money by connecting friends of friends in mini-networks of trust, whether for dating, business or maintaining acquaintances. For many, the buzz over social networking sounds a lot like vintage Internet hyperbole from the late 1990's.
2004-02-02	Speech by GatesLends Visibility To E-Mail Stamp In War on Spam	Should people have to buy electronic stamps to send e-mail? Some Internet experts have long suggested that the rising tide of junk e-mail, or spam, would turn into a trickle if senders had to pay even as little as a penny for each message they sent. Such an amount might be minor for legitimate commerce and communications, but it could destroy businesses that send a million offers in hopes that 10 people will respond. The idea has been dismissed both as impractical and against the free spirit of the Internet.
2004-01-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Yahoo Profit Rises	The Yahoo Japan Corporation, the country's largest Web portal, earned 6.7 billion yen ($63 million) in the October-December quarter, 87 percent more than the same period a year earlier. The company, an affiliate of Yahoo Inc. in the United States, cited rising revenue from its auction site. The company also raised its profit forecast to 9 percent for the year, ending in March. Ken Belson (NYT)
2004-01-21	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Yahoo Makes Deal With Rogers Cable	Yahoo said yesterday that it would take its high-speed broadband service to Canada in a deal with Rogers Cable, the largest cable television system in the country. Starting sometime this year, customers of Rogers's high-speed Internet service will have the option of using e-mail, content and other services provided by Yahoo. Terms of the arrangement were not disclosed, but Yahoo said the deal resembled a venture with SBC Communications in the United States. SBC pays more than $1 a month per subscriber to Yahoo. The move is a response to Bell Canada's deal last year to offer similar services from Microsoft's MSN to its high-speed data customers, said Brahm Eiley, president of the Convergence Consulting Group, a market research firm in Toronto. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2004-01-19	As Consumers Revolt, a Rush to Block Pop-Up Online Ads	The boom in Internet pop-up advertisement may be about to, well, pop. The big ads that flash in separate windows above or below Web pages are among the most intrusive, and to many people, the most obnoxious features on the Internet. Not coincidentally, the pop-up format is also among the most effective for advertisers and the most profitable for Web site publishers.
2004-01-15	Yahoo Posts Strong Profit On Strength Of Ad Sales	There is a new king of online advertising: Yahoo. The company reported strong profit and revenue yesterday for the fourth quarter, meeting analysts' expectations.
2004-01-08	Retreating From Dial-Up Business, Microsoft Aims MSN.com at Yahoo	Microsoft said yesterday that it was repositioning its money-losing MSN Internet service operation to compete more directly with Yahoo's personalized Web portal and America Online's broadband premium service. At the same time, it is planning a new MSN premium service, priced at $9.95 monthly and modeled after Apple Computer's .Mac Internet-based customer support service.
2003-12-14	2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Proving You're Human	Want a free e-mail account at Yahoo? It's yours, once you pass a little test. When you sign up, Yahoo now presents you with a small picture of a distorted word, something that looks as if it had been written on cellophane and stretched out of shape. If you can read the word and type it correctly into a response box, then you'll get your free e-mail. You will also have done something considerably weirder: you will have proved that you're a human being.
2003-12-09	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Introduces Premium Net Services	Yahoo yesterday introduced its long-delayed premium service for users of high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections, apparently using a strategy of less is more. Its new Yahoo Plus service costs $5.95 a month. It competes with America Online's AOL for Broadband, which costs $14.95 a month, and a similar service from Microsoft's MSN at $9.95 a month. All of these services are meant to offer a package of features, like upgraded e-mail, virus protection and video clips, that may not be available from a cable system or telephone company providing broadband service. Yahoo is offering 10 e-mail accounts, each with more storage and some other features not included in its free service. The premium service includes software to protect against viruses and Internet intrusions and to limit the online activities of children. And it includes access to some services Yahoo has tried to sell on a stand-alone basis: premium Internet radio, telephone access to e-mail and news, and extra online storage for photos and files. Yahoo said the service would be available by the end of the month. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2003-10-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Yahoo Japan's Profit Rises	Profit at Yahoo Japan, Japan's largest Internet portal, more than doubled in the July-to-September quarter because of higher demand for the company's auction services. Yahoo Japan earned 5.9 billion yen ($54 million) in the quarter, 111 percent more than the same period a year ago. Sales grew 61 percent. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-10-09	Yahoo's Resurgent Profit Is Led by Strong Advertising	When Terry S. Semel took over as chief executive of Yahoo two years ago, a crucial part of his turnaround plan was to diversify the company, the big Internet portal, away from online advertising and into other services that relied on paying users. The turnaround is going quite nicely. Yesterday, Yahoo said that its third-quarter profit more than doubled. But the biggest and the fastest-growing driver of revenue and profit has been advertising, not fees.
2003-10-06	Spam Fighters Turn to Identifying Legitimate E-Mail	The software engineers helped create the spam problem. Can they solve it? As politicians have been racing to find ways to ban the junk e-mail known as spam, Internet providers have been boasting about filtering technologies capable of identifying the sort of messages typically sent by spammers and disposing of them.
2003-10-03	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Adds Microsoft Games To Site	Yahoo agreed yesterday to offer personal computer games from Microsoft in the online gaming part of its site to increase revenue from fee-based services. Financial terms were not disclosed. Fifteen new games from Microsoft will be added to Yahoo Games on Demand, Yahoo said in a statement. The additions include Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, the second-best-selling PC game in August, according to the market-research company NPD Group. Yahoo Games on Demand is part of Yahoo's strategy to add more services that consumers pay for directly. Fee revenue rose 43 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $69.9 million. A decline in online advertising in 2001 produced a 35 percent sales drop and a $93 million net loss. Shares of Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., rose $1.51, to $37.91.
2003-09-25	Microsoft's Rivals Won't Shut Chat Rooms	Microsoft's two major competitors in providing Internet services said yesterday that they had no plans to emulate its decision to shut down many free chat rooms in the United States and abroad. Free chat rooms have been among the most popular features of the Internet since long before its commercialization. But from the start, chat rooms have been considered a haven for criminal behavior, with child predators getting the most attention from law enforcement agencies. More recently, consumers have expressed frustration with the barrage of spam, including postings that link to pornographic sites.
2003-09-11	HotJobs Ends Ties To Creative Agency	HotJobs in New York, the job search Web site owned by Yahoo, has ended its relationship with Brand Architecture International in New York, which served as the creative agency for HotJobs consumer campaigns that included Super Bowl commercials. HotJobs spent $7 million to $10 million on ads in major media last year. Bouchez Kent & Company in New York, which works for HotJobs on a project basis, creating business-to-business campaigns, will now create consumer campaigns as needed, also on a project basis, said Nissa Anklesaria, a spokeswoman for Yahoo in Sunnyvale, Calif.
2003-09-10	Instant Messaging Pact Reached	The America Online division of AOL Time Warner reached an agreement yesterday with the Reuters Group to link their competing instant messaging services, raising new questions about the possibility of connecting with other such services from Yahoo and MSN. In the past, consumer advocates and communications regulators tried to press AOL, which operates by far the largest instant-messaging service, to connect with rivals so that users of all the services could obtain the benefits of communications with the broadest possible network of users, just as users of telephones, fax machines and e-mail do.
2003-08-21	F.C.C. Lifts Ban on Video For AOL Instant Messaging	The Federal Communications Commission has granted a request by AOL Time Warner to drop restrictions on adding video to its AOL instant messaging service until it allowed users to communicate with other services. The repeal has been expected for months. AOL, the largest instant messaging service with about 60 percent of the market by some measures, and its rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, are racing to add voice and video connections. The decision is of most concern to consumer advocates who hope instant messaging services develop interconnections for users of different systems to send instant messages to one another, just as customers of rival phone or e-mail services do.
2003-07-31	ONLINE DIARY	Bumpy Ride Among the thousands of e-mail based discussion groups, many are private and clublike, while others are public and raucous. But there's nothing else quite like BumpList (www.bumplist.net).
2003-07-15	Yahoo in Deal For Overture, An Internet Listing Service	Yahoo, the big Internet portal, announced yesterday that it would buy Overture Services, an Internet search listings service, for $1.63 billion in cash and stock. Overture, which makes money by selling top spots on search listings to advertisers and then distributing those so-called sponsored results on MSN, Yahoo and other popular sites, has been rumored to be a candidate for a takeover for months.
2003-07-10	Yahoo's Earnings Double As Revenue Sets a Record	Profits more than doubled at Yahoo, the big Internet portal, in the second quarter as its revenue also grew briskly and even exceeded the record it set at the peak of the Internet boom. But those results were not enough to satisfy investors who have bid up Yahoo's shares by 28 percent over the last month.
2003-06-05	Technology Briefing | People: Yahoo Names New Marketing Chief	Yahoo said yesterday that it had named Cammie Dunaway of the Frito-Lay Company as chief marketing officer. The previous marketing chief, John H. Costello, accepted a job at Home Depot Inc. Ms. Dunaway, 40, helped manage the Doritos, Cheetos, Lays and Ruffles brands of snacks at Frito-Lay, a unit of PepsiCo, for the last 13 years, Yahoo said in a statement. She will join the company later this month. Ms. Dunaway is taking over marketing as Yahoo is trying to get more Internet surfers to use its search engine and generate more revenue from fee-based offerings, including its online dating service. The company started a national advertising campaign for its search engine last month, after redesigning the service in April. Mr. Costello, Yahoo's previous chief marketing officer, left in October 2002 to become chief marketing officer of Home Depot. Yahoo shares rose $1.04, or 3.6 percent, to $29.59.
2003-05-15	Instant Messaging Moves Beyond Chat to Multimedia	''I'M pretty much on instant messaging from when I get home until I go to bed,'' said Laura Gittleson, a 15-year-old in Colts Neck, N.J. She is not alone. America Online, the service Ms. Gittleson uses, says 195 million people use its instant messaging service, their keystrokes generating more than 1.6 billion messages a day. For those users, instant messaging -- or IM -- has become an intrinsic part of their social fabric.
2003-04-28	3 E-Mail Giants Will Join In an Effort to Reduce Spam	The three leading providers of e-mail accounts said yesterday that they had started to work together to develop ways to reduce the unwanted commercial messages, commonly known as spam, that are increasingly clogging their customers' mailboxes. The companies -- America Online, Microsoft and Yahoo -- are calling for technical changes in the way e-mail is passed around cyberspace to make it easier to determine who really sent it and what it is about.
2003-04-13	In Searching the Web, Google Finds Riches	IN the last few years, Google has risen as a force on the Internet by offering its smarter, faster searches as a free public service. Now the band of technoinsurgents who run the company are striking a blow against the business strategies of giant Web portals like America Online, Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN by rewriting the rules of Internet advertising. Emerging as a powerful new marketing medium, Google has found a route to profitability that stands apart in a Silicon Valley that is still crippled by the dot-com crash.
2003-04-11	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the first-quarter financial results of Yahoo misstated the number of subscribers to its various fee-based services. It is 2.9 million, not 2.7 million.
2003-04-10	Profits Exceeded Expectations at Yahoo in First Quarter	Better-than-expected advertising sales, along with steady growth of its fee-based businesses, helped Yahoo earn better-than-expected profits in the first quarter. Yahoo is the largest Web portal and has been the most successful major Internet company in rebuilding its advertising business after the dot-com collapse two years ago. The company said ad sales grew fastest for the text advertisements it displays along with Internet search results. But it also reported strong demand for graphic advertising by companies trying to promote consumer products online.
2003-04-07	Yahoo Plans Improvements in Effort to Regain Lost Ground	Can Yahoo find the ground it lost in the search business? In 1999, Yahoo gave a small company its first big break, hiring it to provide results for its Internet search service. By last year, that company, Google, had usurped Yahoo as the No. 1 site for World Wide Web searches.
2003-03-30	Teenager's Paths Diverge, Slightly, in Cyberspace	Young boys and girls have similar tastes in Web sites, but those similarities fade as they grow older. There are thousands of sites from which to choose, but a 2002 survey by the Zandl Group found that nick.com, Nickelodeon's site, and yahoo.com were popular among boys and girls 8 to 12. Neopets.com, a game site, was No. 3 with girls and No. 5 with boys. Teenage boys and girls liked yahoo.com the best, but the boys also preferred online auction and sports sites. The girls favored fashion sites and chat rooms. Another recent survey by Teenage Research Unlimited helps explain the differences. About 80 percent of teenage girls who go online use e-mail, compared with 69 percent of boys. About 60 percent of the boys play games online, compared with 50 percent of the girls. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN
2003-03-18	Market Place; A Financier by Another Name Was a Self-Described Con Man	Theodore Roxford seems like a big wheel. Henry Kravis has called upon him for advice, and the buyout giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has paid him thousands of dollars for his work. David Bonderman of the Texas Pacific Group recently corresponded with him about working together. Earlier this month, he went public with a $108 million offer for Zapata, the one-time oil and gas company founded by former President George Bush.
2003-03-17	Yahoo's Paid Video to Supply Sports, Finance and 'Survivor'	After spending more than a year trying to figure out what sort of video programming Internet users will pay for, Yahoo is set to introduce its first subscription video service. So far, it has determined that America wants to see college basketball, investment news and the latest boiled rat recipe from CBS's ''Survivor.''
2003-03-11	Instant Messaging Leaves School for Office	Instant messaging, long associated with teenagers staying up late to chat online with friends, is moving into the workplace with an impact that has started to rival e-mail and the cellphone. Less intrusive than a phone call and more immediate than e-mail, instant messaging is finding users far more quickly than e-mail did when it was first introduced, according to Forrester Research, a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. In the last year alone, Forrester said, the number of instant messages has grown by more than 50 percent, so that nearly one-third of American adults are now IM-ing, as it is called, with their children, clients, colleagues and each other.
2003-02-13	Yahoo Outlines Plans for Adding Premium Services	At its last meeting with analysts, 15 months ago, Yahoo gave each of them a gift of a yo-yo to make the point that what goes down can come up. At a dinner on Tuesday before its meeting yesterday, the company gave analysts a set of balls, to show that it has stabilized its finances and is now juggling several opportunities for growth. In the meeting yesterday, at Yahoo's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., the company spent much of its time outlining plans for new premium services it intends to introduce to its Web portal later this year. These include a mix of new services -- like video programming to be watched on computer screens, and expanded versions of its core offerings like e-mail.
2003-02-12	Technology Briefing | Internet: French Court Rejects Suit Against Yahoo	After a three-year legal fight, a Paris court yesterday rejected a lawsuit by French human rights advocates and Holocaust survivors who sued Yahoo for one symbolic euro. They accused Yahoo of having condoned war crimes when it sold Nazi paraphernalia, including flags with swastikas, on its auction pages. French law forbids the display or sale of racist material, but the items were available to French users who clicked on the American pages. The court said that Yahoo did not seek to ''justify war crimes and crimes against humanity'' when it sold the items on its Web site. It was the second lawsuit against Yahoo by French human rights advocates; the first was started in 2000. Kerry Shaw (NYT)
2003-02-10	E-Commerce Report; Unscrupulous advertisers are said to outbid reputable merchants for top billings in online searches.	TOP online merchants have advertised extensively on search sites like Google, Yahoo, MSN and AOL, buying their way to prominence. But analysts and executives say that reputable advertisers increasingly find themselves outbid for top search listings by unscrupulous and perhaps fraudulent e-tailers. Executives for the search services say they weed out the bad actors when they are made aware of them, but critics say the search sites are not aggressive enough.

Dictators need not apply. The job opening is for a neighborhood Web site, Morningside-Heights.net, and a Yahoo chat room, Mhnet, that has become the soapbox of choice for the neighborhood's liberal-leaning activists and their unfettered opinions.
2003-01-27	Online dating, a hushed subject but a roaring business, goes very public in a marketing battle.	THE battle in the online dating service business has become as competitive as the contest among looking-for-love singles angling for that final rose from ''The Bachelor.'' Market leaders like Match.com, a unit of USA Interactive, and Yahoo Personals, are now turning to well-known creative shops and significantly increasing marketing budgets. Their ads are now showing up in prime time on shows like ''The West Wing'' and ''Joe Millionaire,'' while promotional efforts have paid off in placements like Match.com's on the six-part series on dating appearing on ''Today.''
2003-01-23	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Profit At Yahoo Japan	Japan's largest Internet portal, the Yahoo Japan Corporation, said that its profit more than doubled last quarter, helped by strong sales of broadband Internet connections and online auctions. The company, which is half owned by the Softbank Corporation, earned 3.56 billion yen ($30 million), 121 percent above the period last year. Sales in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was the third quarter of the company's fiscal year, almost doubled to 16.3 billion yen. Though online advertising has slowed, Yahoo Japan started charging for its market-leading auction site and provides high-speed Internet access. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-01-16	Yahoo Plans Big Expansion Of Broadband	Buoyed by its growing sales and profits, Yahoo is planning to take its high-speed Internet access service nationwide. Yesterday, the big Internet portal announced better-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter of 2002. It was able to expand its sales of online advertising, even as it added new services that generate monthly fees from users.
2003-01-06	Seeking Market Clarity	The battle among the top Web search sites for the United States audience has grown fiercer, and more complex, with the recent announcement that Yahoo plans to buy Inktomi, a Web search technology company, for $235 million in cash. One of Yahoo's main competitors is Google, which besides operating its own popular search site, competes with Inktomi in offering search technology to other companies. Inktomi's clients include MSN.com, Overture, About.com and Looksmart. Among Google's clients are AOL Properties, Ask Jeeves, Netscape and here is where things get interesting Yahoo itself. Both Inktomi and Google, meanwhile, do business with HotBot, the search service owned by Lycos.
2002-12-24	Market Place; In a move to shore up its position, Yahoo plans to buy Inktomi.	MOVING to re-establish itself as the pre-eminent place to search the Internet, Yahoo said yesterday that it would buy Inktomi, a maker of Web search technology, for $235 million in cash. Searching for Web sites remains the second-most-popular online activity after e-mail. And it has proved to be a lucrative business, because advertisers have found that the best way to attract users to their sites is to place advertisements next to or even among Web search listings.
2002-12-19	ONLINE DIARY	Clickable Countdowns Online Advent calendars that count down from Dec. 1 to Christmas are popular holiday destinations. Two of the best are not overtly religious and will appeal to anyone looking for seasonal cheer, not to mention Web graphics. The Q Creative Calendar (www.q-creative.com), in its fifth year, is the work of a freelance designer, Susan J. Preston. (The site is named for her business.) Its December run has become an annual event for thousands of visitors.
2002-12-04	Competition Forces AOL To Emphasize Faster Links	AOL Time Warner yesterday presented a new strategy for its AOL division to compete for high-speed Internet users, acknowledging that the service that helped make the Internet a mass medium is now in danger of falling behind as consumers seek faster connections online. AOL Time Warner said AOL was redirecting its efforts toward marketing an upgraded version of its high-speed service intended to take advantage of the elaborate multimedia potential of high-speed Internet connections, partly by offering music and videos from its sister companies. AOL said it would seek to persuade high-speed users to pay an additional monthly fee of about $15 for its service even after buying broadband access from another company for as much as $50 a month.
2002-11-20	National Briefing | Midwest: Minnesota: A Faxed Search Warrant	A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled that evidence collected from the Internet without a direct police presence is admissible in a case against a Minneapolis man accused of inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct. The decision reverses a federal judge's ruling, and may set a precedent. The St. Paul police faxed a search warrant to the Internet company Yahoo! to obtain e-mail between the suspect, Dale Robert Bach, and potential victims. Jo Napolitano (NYT)
2002-11-18	New Group Urges F.C.C. to Alter Internet Broadband Policy	A group of technology and media companies including Microsoft, Disney Yahoo and eBay plans to send a letter to the Federal Communications Commission today arguing that the open nature of the Internet will be lost unless the agency amends its broadband policy. The formation of the group signals a growing fear that the F.C.C., in an effort to spur investment in broadband Internet services, is ceding control to a handful of cable and phone companies over a network long seen as inherently immune to controlling influences.
2002-10-17	A Tricky Maze for Consumers	Businesses, responding to lawmakers and consumers, say they are giving customers more ways than ever to control how their personal information is used and sold. But, in fact, many companies all but frustrate their customers' attempts to exercise that control. Barbara Bechtold of Sacramento recounts the unending process of trying to keep companies from selling her e-mail address and the details of her credit card accounts, insurance policies and mortgage inquiries.
2002-10-10	Yahoo's Profits and Sales Are Better Than Expected	Yahoo Inc. posted better-than-expected sales and profits yesterday as it gained market share in both advertising and job listings from its rivals. It also said it had renewed its contract with Google to provide results for searches of Web pages. Many people expected Yahoo to abandon Google, which has become one of the most popular sites, in part because of the credit it received on Yahoo's pages.
2002-10-08	Technology Briefing | Internet: House Passes Bill On Net Radio	A bill granting a reprieve from fees that threatened to drive small Internet radio companies out of business was passed yesterday by the House of Representatives. The bill, which has not yet been passed by the Senate, would let operators of Internet radio companies that make less than $500,000 pay artists and labels a percentage of their revenue instead of a flat per-song fee. Larger Internet radio companies, like America Online or Yahoo, and midsize companies, like Live365, would still be required to pay the fees set in June by the Librarian of Congress. Both the recording industry and Internet radio companies have challenged those fees, which hold radio stations responsible for paying about one-fourteenth of a cent for each song heard by each listener over the Internet. Last month, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, above, introduced legislation that would have delayed payments for all Webcasters by six months, a move that helped spur the deal reflected in the House bill.

2002-10-03	Panel's Report Offers Details On 'Spinning' Of New Stocks	A Congressional committee is accusing the Goldman Sachs Group and two other investment banks of rewarding senior executives of their corporate clients with preferential allocations of new stocks, according to a committee document obtained yesterday. The House Financial Services Committee found that executives of about 20 companies, including the chief executive of eBay and a founder of Yahoo, received shares of initial public offerings from Goldman Sachs in a practice known on Wall Street as ''spinning,'' the report says. Margaret Whitman, eBay's chief executive and a director of Goldman Sachs, was among the officers and directors who ''flipped,'' or quickly sold, shares of new stocks for quick profits, the report says.

2002-09-24	All the News Google Algorithms Say Is Fit to Print	Google, the rapidly growing online search engine, introduced a service yesterday that uses its search algorithms -- but no human editors -- to create a news page that looks not much different from those of many news Web sites. ''We are trying to leverage the experience of all the editors out there,'' said Larry Page, Google's co-founder and president for products. The site brings together headlines, and makes its automated news judgments, from information appearing on 4,000 sites.
2002-09-24	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Introduces Fee-Based Game Service	Yahoo, owner of the most-used Internet search site, introduced a fee-based video-game service for customers yesterday, featuring high-speed Internet connections. Users of the Games on Demand service can download and play more than 40 titles, including Zapper, Civilization III and Star Trek Armada II. Prices start at $4.95 for the rental of one game for three days, and rise to $14.95 to rent 10 games for 30 days, Yahoo said. The games are being offered through Yahoo's high-speed Internet-access service with SBC Communications Inc. The companies agreed earlier this month to sell the service over SBC's phone lines in 13 states. Yahoo is working toward gaining more revenue through subscriptions and less through advertising, it has said.
2002-09-11	With ad revenue down, Yahoo tries to win agencies' favor.	ONE hot Friday last month, 40 people from three advertising agencies in Manhattan boarded a chartered bus for a hilly estate in the Westchester town of Purdy's. Their destination: Camp Yahoo, where the wine flowed liberally, the lobsters were boiled by the dozens and the pool offered a chance to lounge on giant purple-and-yellow beach towels being given away. Though such shindigs for advertisers and agencies have long been a staple of more traditional media like magazines and television networks, they are new to Yahoo. During the Internet boom, when the ad dollars seemed never-ending, Yahoo did not do much coddling of its clients. But when advertising hit the wall early last year for Yahoo, one of the three big Internet portals, the company decided it was time to be friendly, really friendly.
2002-08-30	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Softbank Sells Stakes	The Softbank Corporation, trying to meet its debt payments and to expand its broadband business, sold part of its stakes in Yahoo and UTStarcom Inc. Softbank sold 5 percent of both companies, leaving it with 9 percent of Yahoo, the American Internet search company, and 26 percent of UTStarcom, a telecommunications equipment maker. The sales raised $164 million, less than a third of the 67.5 billion yen ($568 million) in debts Softbank will have to pay back within a year. The investment company, which lost 89 billion yen last year, is trying to expand in the high-speed Internet connection business. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-08-07	World Business Briefing | Europe: Finland: Yahoo Takes Wireless Stake	The Internet company Yahoo agreed to buy 15 percent of Zed, a content provider for mobile phones and other wireless devices that is owned by the Sonera Corporation, a Finnish mobile phone company. Yahoo has the right to increase its stake to 100 percent in the next two years, or withdraw from the investment completely. The full financial terms were not disclosed. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)

Back in 1996, Mr. Gustafson was paid $590 to record his yodel for what he said he thought was one-time use by Yahoo, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. ''It was just a commercial for a small company,'' Mr. Gustafson recalled. But watching the Super Bowl two years later, he heard a familiar sound his own voice.

2002-07-20	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Yahoo's Profit Doubles	Yahoo Japan said profit nearly doubled in the April-June period as installations from the company's broadband Internet service grew. Yahoo, Japan's largest Internet portal, earned 2.2 billion yen ($18.9 million), 98 percent more than in the period a year ago. Sales more than doubled, thanks to income from a subsidiary, BB Technologies, which now has 660,000 subscribers for its high-speed Internet connections. Yahoo Japan is trying to reduce its reliance on advertising fees and now generates 35 percent of its revenue from selling broadband connections. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-07-11	Ad Resurgence Helps Buoy Latest Figures from Yahoo	Yahoo Inc., the search engine turned Internet advertising hub, posted quarterly sales and profit figures today that exceeded the projections of Wall Street analysts. The company, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., also increased its own earlier estimates for its performance for the year's second half, asserting that its capacity to attract advertising is reviving after a dismal decline in the aftermath of the dot-com bust.
2002-06-06	ONLINE DIARY	Just Asking Is Winnie the Pooh male or female? What is the meaning of life? Such queries are daily fodder at Ask Yahoo (ask.yahoo.com), a question-and-answer site where human editors will seemingly tackle even such thorny sex and metaphysical issues at no charge. Unlike sites that dispense so-called expert advice, Ask Yahoo is more of a research service, and a quirky one at that.
2002-05-24	Yahoo Drops Auctions in Most of Europe	Failing to eclipse its major rival in the online auction market overseas, Yahoo said today that it would stop offering its own auctions in six European countries and promote eBay's service instead. The decision mirrors an important change that has been reshaping the online industry since the burst of the Internet bubble as companies are forced to choose between businesses that are likely to produce profits and those that are not.
2002-05-23	ONLINE DIARY	PHOTOGRAPHY has met its pixel-perfect match in the Web. Photos -- profound, profane or merely pretty -- abound online. Never has the general public had such broad access to the photographic record, from historical images to news photos to microscopic ''beershots.'' And did you hear the one about the funny captions? The Historical Photo Going back to the first daguerreotypes, there are, stunningly, nearly nine million historical photographs on the Web, according to David Mattison of the British Columbia Archives in Victoria. (He defines historical as at least 25 years old.) Historical photographs were among the first artifacts or documents to be digitized for display online. Mr. Mattison explains this and more in a recent link-filled article that will take you on a visual surf through history (www.infotoday.com/searcher/may02/mattison.htm).
2002-05-13	Compressed Data; The Big Yahoo Privacy Storm That Wasn't	Internet privacy is like the weather. Everyone complains about it, and no one does anything about it. The latest example involves users of Yahoo, the vast Internet portal that set off howls of protest when it abruptly changed its marketing policy in March. Suddenly, Yahoo granted itself the right to send advertising messages to tens of millions of its users who had previously asked to receive none. The blanket permission went beyond e-mail to include postal mailings and telemarketing phone calls.
2002-05-01	Technology Briefing | Internet: Google Gaining On Yahoo, Report Says	The research firm WebSideStory released a report yesterday indicating that Google was gaining market share among Internet search sites and could challenge the longtime leader, Yahoo. Of all search referrals worldwide, 36.35 percent come from Yahoo while 31.87 percent are from Google. In June 2000, Google generated 1 percent of search referrals, while Yahoo had about 46 percent. The study was conducted by the StatMarket unit of WebSideStory. The firm said the next most-used service was MSN, which fielded 12.73 percent of requests. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
2002-04-28	The Bears on This Message Board Had Enron Pegged	DURING the stock market mania, Internet message boards earned a reputation as breeding grounds for stock touts. Stock promoters no longer needed to rent offices with banks of phones to profit by manipulating shares. An Internet connection was all the pump-and-dump guys required. But an academic study to be published this fall in The Journal of Investing indicates that chat rooms can also contain valuable morsels for investors.
2002-04-26	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Signs Deal With Overture	Yahoo, the Internet search engine, signed a three-year deal yesterday to display search listings provided by Overture Services, the company formerly known as Goto.com that auctions the right to be displayed on Yahoo and other search services. In November, Yahoo started putting Overture listings above those from its directory, but it said it wanted to develop a paid listing service so as not to split the fees with Overture. Since then Overture and Google, another search engine, actively bid for Yahoo's business. Neither company would say how much Overture is paying Yahoo, but analysts think that it will be more than $50 million a year. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2002-04-25	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Names a No. 2 Executive	Yahoo, the Internet portal, which is trying to refashion itself as a collection of fee-based services and classified ads, named Daniel Rosensweig its No. 2 executive yesterday. Mr. Rosensweig, 41, will be chief operating officer and look after the company's six business lines, product development, marketing and advertising sales. Mr. Rosensweig was the president of CNET Networks, an operator of technology Web sites, and was the chief executive of its rival, ZDnet, before it was bought by CNET. While with ZDNet, Mr. Rosensweig developed a relationship with Yahoo, because ZDnet's owner, Ziff Davis, was controlled by Softbank, a Japanese conglomerate that has been a major holder in Yahoo. Mr. Rosensweig replaces Jeffrey Mallet, Yahoo's longtime president, who announced his resignation in January. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2002-04-25	Technology Briefing | Internet: F.T.C. Moves Against Prize Promotion	The Federal Trade Commission has moved to shut down an Internet operation that sent unsolicited e-mail messages notifying ''winners'' of video game consoles and other prizes. The promotion was said to be sponsored by the Web portal Yahoo, but it then directed those who tried to claim the prizes to a pornographic Web site. Consumers who were connected to the site were charged $3.99 a minute, F.T.C. officials said. A federal court in Nevada has shut down the operation and frozen its assets pending trial. The agency says the operation bilked consumers out of millions of dollars, and it asked the court to preserve the assets for redress.
2002-04-20	YAHOO NAMES WARNER BROS. ONLINE CHIEF AS DIVISION HEAD	Yahoo Inc. named James Moloshok senior vice president for its media and information division yesterday. Mr. Moloshok was co-founder and president of Warner Brothers Online, running the company's Internet businesses. He was also the president and chief executive of Entertaindom.com, a Web site featuring online programming, Yahoo said. He joined Warner Brothers in 1989 and was in charge of marketing for programs like ''Friends'' and ''ER,'' Yahoo said. Yahoo's chief executive, Terry Semel, who joined the company last year, was chairman of Warner Brothers while Mr. Moloshok was there.
2002-04-19	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Cuts Ties To Careerbuilder	Yahoo has made HotJobs.com the exclusive provider of help wanted ads on its Web sites, ending an agreement with CareerBuilder that had about a year left to run. Yahoo and CareerBuilder, which is jointly owned by the newspaper publishers Knight Ridder and the Tribune Company, agreed to end their relationship, spokesmen for the two companies said. CareerBuilder and HotJobs.com compete for advertising from corporate recruiters. Yahoo bought HotJobs.com in February for $439 million. Help wanted advertising has been one of the fastest-growing forms of advertising on the Web.
2002-04-17	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Yahoo Stake Sold	The Softbank Corporation said a subsidiary, Softbank America Inc., sold part of its stake in Yahoo Inc., raising $119 million in capital gains. Softbank has been under pressure to raise cash to service its debt, and Yahoo and Yahoo Japan are among the most valuable holdings in its portfolio. Softbank America remains Yahoo's largest investor with 14.3 percent, but Softbank no longer has to consolidate Yahoo on its balance sheet. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-04-11	Privacy Policy On Web Shifts As Profits Ebb	Pressed for profits, Internet companies are increasingly selling access to their users' postal mail addresses and telephone numbers, in addition to flooding their e-mail boxes with junk mail. Yahoo, the vast Internet portal, just changed its privacy policy to make it clear that it has the right to send mail and make sales calls to tens of millions of its registered users. And it has given itself permission to send users e-mail marketing messages on behalf of its own growing family of services, even if those users had previously asked not to receive any marketing from Yahoo. Users have 60 days to go to a page on Yahoo's Web site where they can record a choice not to receive telephone, postal or e-mail messages in various categories.
2002-04-11	Yahoo Gains in Revenue, Aided by Online Dating Service	A series of hot dates has spiced up the otherwise bleak business at Yahoo. While advertising revenue continues to decline for Yahoo, the big Internet portal, fee income, especially from its rapidly growing online personals service, is making up the difference.
2002-04-08	E-Commerce Report; The three big Internet portals begin to distinguish among themselves as shopping malls.	YAHOO and MSN have worked hard at catching up to America Online in recent years, at least as far as their online shopping malls go. The three portals now feature many of the same marquee retailers, offering the same merchandise, frequently at the same prices. Not surprisingly, they attract the same types of people -- in their mid-40's, with household incomes around $65,000 and annual online spending of about $450. So why would so many retailers continue to throw advertising money at all three?
2002-04-08	Google's Toughest Search Is for a Business Model	As Eric Schmidt prepared the agenda for last September's board meeting of Google, the Internet search company, he added an item: ''Financing Plans -- prepare for initial public offering.'' ''I assumed I was brought in to take the company public,'' recalled Mr. Schmidt, who became chairman of Google in March 2001 after a long career at Sun Microsystems and four years as chief executive of Novell.
2002-03-29	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Alters Privacy Policy	Yahoo changed its privacy policy yesterday to give it far more latitude to send e-mail or postal mail and make phone calls to sell its services and those of the companies it works with. Yahoo's policy had strictly prohibited the sale or rental of personally identifiable information. Customers could choose, by selecting an option, to receive marketing messages from other companies. Yesterday, Yahoo started sending an e-mail message to customers telling them that unless they changed options on its site, they would be agreeing to receive e-mail, phone calls and postal mail on behalf of Yahoo's services, including partners like stores that rent space in Yahoo's shopping channel. Yahoo's new policy gives it more latitude to disclose personal information, for example, in ''situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,'' it said. Yahoo also permits itself to transfer personal information if the company is bought. Saul Hansell (NYT)

2002-02-11	New Economy; Bracing for a flood of efforts to control speech seen as hateful or terrorist.	SINCE Sept. 11, nations that have strong laws and traditions against hate speech are apparently growing even more alarmed about inflammatory expression that they fear could lead to racial or religious violence. That worries some civil libertarians in the United States, who point to a French court decision that they believe handed governments and groups a blueprint for how to censor online hate speech that may be illegal within one country's borders but perfectly lawful elsewhere.
2002-02-07	Software Puts Together What I.M. Has Torn Asunder	Mom uses AOL Instant Messenger, your business partner has MSN Messenger, and your pals all prefer ICQ. What's a person-to-person chatter to do? One option is Trillian, software that can be downloaded from the Web site of a fledgling Connecticut company, Cerulean Studios (www.trillian.cc). The newest version was released last week and is free (although the company happily welcomes donations).
2002-02-06	Technology Briefing | Internet: 'Mlife' Draws Super Bowl Traffic	The annual analysis by Jupiter Media Metrix of Web site traffic surrounding the Super Bowl showed big increases for the sites of two advertisers. One was AT&T Wireless, which promoted a site (www.mlife.com) related to a campaign, ''Welcome to mlife,'' that was introduced in commercials during Super Bowl XXXVI on Sunday. Traffic to the site rose to 681,000 so-called unique visitors on Sunday, the analysis found, from 34,000 on Saturday, even though some computer users reported trouble reaching the site. The other site, www.pepsi.yahoo.com, which had 135,000 visitors on Sunday after negligible visitors on Saturday, was set up by Yahoo and the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo. At the site, viewers could vote for a Pepsi commercial to be shown during the game's second quarter. Traffic to other sites with Super Bowl commercials showed no significant gains.

2002-01-24	Technology Briefing | Internet: Online On the Rails	Amtrak, with help from Yahoo and Compaq Computer, began offering free wireless Internet service on some of its trains. The service is available on Amtrak's Acela Regional, between Washington and Boston; the Capitols, between Sacramento, Oakland and San Jose; and the Hiawatha, between Chicago and Milwaukee. Amtrak mounted Compaq iPAQ Pocket personal computers on the trains, with Yahoo providing wireless connections. While electrical outlets for laptops are scattered throughout the trains, the interactive service is available only on the Compaq machines, which are in one car of each train, an Amtrak spokeswoman said.
2002-01-23	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Jan. 7 about Yahoo's new corporate strategy referred incorrectly to comments from people involved in the company's efforts to buy Headhunter.net, an online job-listing site. They said that although Yahoo had not made a formal offer, it had been prepared to pay more than the $200 million offered by CareerBuilder, which eventually bought the site. They did not say that CareerBuilder's bid was less than Yahoo's final offer.
2002-01-23	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Starting Fee-Based Search Service	The search engine and Web portal company Yahoo plans to introduce a fee-based search service today. The company said that the service, Premium Document Search, would let users search for articles and other documents from more than 7,100 newspapers, trade journals and other sources. Users may view each document for a $2.95 fee, or they can pay $4.95 a month to view up to 50 documents. Yahoo said that it would continue to offer its free service.
2002-01-17	Yahoo Posts Lower-Than-Expected Loss; President Says He Will Quit	Jeff Mallet, the No. 2 executive of Yahoo, the struggling Internet portal, said yesterday that he would resign, even as the company announced higher revenue and lower losses than it had forecast. Mr. Mallet, a peripatetic executive who was often Yahoo's chief salesman and most involved day-to-day manager, has been one of the few members of the company's original management team to remain. Last year, Timothy Koogle, the original chief executive, was replaced by Terry Semel, a former Hollywood executive.
2001-12-28	Yahoo Wins Race for HotJobs As TMP Declines to Raise Bid	The takeover battle for HotJobs .com, the Internet's second-largest career site, ended before it began. Yahoo wrested HotJobs.com away from TMP Worldwide yesterday as TMP, parent company of Monster .com, surrendered without firing a shot. TMP said it would not engage in a bidding war for HotJobs.com, which it had agreed to buy six months ago, refusing to top Yahoo's unsolicited offer of $436 million.
2001-12-27	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ads Cut From Web Traffic Count	Those pop-up Internet advertisements will be popping up in at least one less place -- the Jupiter Media Metrix rankings of the most popular Web sites. Since this sort of ad opens a separate browser window, Jupiter had counted the ad as it did any other Web site. As a result, x10.com, which has blanketed the Web with pop-up ads promoting wireless cameras, ranked as the fifth-most frequently visited site in Jupiter's October rankings, with 39 million users. Big Web sites, like Yahoo, said this policy sullied ratings used by both advertisers and investors. In the November rankings, released yesterday, x10 was nowhere to be found. Jupiter attributed the change to ''the evolving Internet landscape.'' Saul Hansell (NYT)
2001-12-25	HotJobs.com Tells Suitor to Surpass a Rival Bid From Yahoo	Call it the war for help-wanted dot-coms. HotJobs.com, the Internet's second-largest career site, gave TMP Worldwide, the parent company of Monster.com, an ultimatum yesterday: Surpass a $436 million unsolicited takeover bid from Yahoo within 72 hours or their six-month-old merger agreement is off.
2001-12-18	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Offers Music Service	Yahoo started a music service yesterday, offering Internet users free access to thousands of music videos and to online radio content. The company hopes to support the service through advertising, sponsorships and retail partnerships. The offering is based on a service created by Launch.com, a music company in Santa Monica, Calif., acquired earlier this year by Yahoo for $12 million. In calling the service ''Launch, Your Yahoo Music Experience,'' Yahoo departed from its usual strategy. Typically, a Yahoo acquisition is given a Yahoo brand name. The company said it made an exception because Launch already had strong name recognition. Matt Richtel (NYT)
2001-12-14	Technology Briefing | Internet: Hotjobs.Com Shares Surge On Offer	Shares in the job-listing Web site HotJobs.com rose 59 percent yesterday after Yahoo made an offer to buy the site for $436 million. Shares rose $3.83, to $10.30. The offer topped a $382 million bid by TMP Worldwide, owner of the Monster.com job-posting site. TMP and Monster.com did not return phone calls yesterday. But in a statement released late Wednesday, HotJobs said that its deal with TMP remained in effect. HotJobs.com also said that there was ''no assurance as to whether a transaction would result from any discussions with Yahoo.''
2001-12-13	Yahoo Bids for Career Site In Threat to Previous Deal	Trying to bolster its online recruiting business, Yahoo made an unsolicited bid late yesterday to acquire HotJobs.com, the Internet's second-largest career site, for $436 million in cash and stock. If successful, Yahoo's offer would break up a deal between HotJobs and TMP Worldwide, the parent company of Monster.com, which is the leading online recruitment company with about 42 percent of the market. That all-stock deal was valued at $460 million when it was struck in June, but a decline in TMP's stock price, as the job market has soured, has brought the value of the transaction down to $366 million.
2001-11-21	Softbank of Japan Marks Down Portfolio	The once high-flying Internet conglomerate Softbank said today that it had marked down the value of its sprawling portfolio of major investments in other Internet companies by nearly 51 billion yen ($414 million), resulting in a loss of 54.3 billion yen ($441 million) in the six months ended Sept. 30. The company's large stakes in Yahoo, Yahoo Japan and E*Trade Group have lost more than 80 percent of their value since the technology bubble burst last year.
2001-11-15	THE MARKETS: Market Place; As he tries to generate revenue, Yahoo's chief moves the company away from its old culture.	FOR Terry Semel of Yahoo, this is where the hard part begins. It's been seven months since Mr. Semel, the longtime co-leader of the Warner Brothers studio, was named as chief executive of Yahoo. After what many investors felt was a slow start, he has begun to outline his plan to revive the once highflying Internet portal.
2001-11-14	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo To Feature Paid Search Results	Yahoo, by far the biggest search engine on the Internet, said it would display listings from sites that pay money ahead of sites that were chosen by its editors. The paid listings will be provided by Overture Services, formerly GoTo.com, which has similar arrangements with America Online, Lycos and parts of Microsoft's MSN. Overture runs an auction among advertising sites, which bid how much they will pay each time users click on the link to their site; those that offer the largest payments are listed first. On Yahoo, the five top-paying sites will be listed first, in a section called ''sponsored matches'' above its other listings. The deal will last for six months, after which Yahoo will decide if it will sell its own paid listings or continue using those from Overture. Neither company would discuss the financial terms of the deal. In Overture's deal with AOL, it agreed to share the revenue from the listings with a minimum of $50 million over 18 months. Yahoo is under enormous pressure to find new sources of revenue to replace advertising from Internet companies. It is holding an analyst meeting Thursday to detail its plans for investors.

2001-11-09	Court Says France Can't Censor Yahoo Site	In a decision that is being applauded by Internet companies and civil liberties groups, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday that the United States Constitution's protections of free speech trumped a French order requiring Yahoo to remove Nazi materials from its Web site. ''Although France has the sovereign right to regulate what speech is permissible in France, this court may not enforce a foreign order that violates the protections of the United States Constitution by chilling protected speech that occurs simultaneously within our borders,'' wrote Judge Jeremy Fogel of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Jose.
2001-11-07	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Revises Auction Fees	Continuing its effort to squeeze revenue out of customers who once used its services free, Yahoo said it intended to change the way it charges sellers on its auction site. In January, to discourage frivolous postings on its auction site, Yahoo imposed fees of 20 cents to $2.25 for each item listed. Starting Nov. 20, sellers will pay only 5 to 75 cents to list their goods, but Yahoo will add a transaction fee. The company will charge sliding fees ranging from 2 percent for items selling for less than $25, plus 1 percent of the next $975, and 0.5 percent of the amount above $1,000. The pricing model, which Yahoo said customers had requested, more closely resembles that of the company's larger auctions rival, eBay. Yahoo said its changes had improved the percentage of auctions that close, to 31 percent from less than 10 percent. Chris Gaither (NYT)

2001-10-24	Technology Briefing | Internet: Online Services Agree To Ratings	Some of the biggest companies in the online world said they would take part in a voluntary labeling system to help parents shield children from online content, like nudity, the parents find objectionable. AOL Time Warner, Yahoo and the Microsoft Network voiced support for the Internet Content Ratings Association, which promotes the worldwide adoption of tools for blocking sites that are included in the major Internet browser programs. The group says it offers an alternative to government regulation. Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, applauded the efforts, but said parents should use sites like www.getnetwise.org to see the full range of options. ''We don't think there's a one-size-fits-all strategy,'' he said. John Schwartz (NYT)
2001-10-23	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Profit At Yahoo Japan	Profit at Japan's largest online directory, the Yahoo Japan Corporation, nearly doubled in the July-September quarter as sales of modems offset slowing advertising revenue. Yahoo Japan, a subsidiary of the Softbank Corporation and the Yahoo Corporation of the United States, earned 1.3 billion yen ($10.7 million), 91 percent more than in the period a year ago. With online advertising rates collapsing, Yahoo Japan started selling modems for high-speed Internet connections to another Softbank subsidiary, BB Technology. Yahoo Japan's sales more than doubled in the quarter, with modem sales making up 43 percent of that total. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-10-16	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Offers a Bargain Basement	With shoppers interested in little other than the bargain basement, Yahoo, the Internet portal, said yesterday that it would open Yahoo Warehouse for used and discounted merchandise. The service, which will begin in late October, is modeled after eBay's Half.com, which lets individuals and businesses sell goods at fixed prices rather than through auctions. Yahoo declined to specify the cost to merchants to sell through its new service, but said its commission will be less than that of Half.com, which charges 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on the price of the item. Yahoo also said it would redesign its shopping site to allow users to search for items. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2001-10-11	Ads Down, Yahoo Expects a Hard Quarter	In the face of a dismal market for advertising, Yahoo said yesterday that it barely met its forecasts for revenue and profit in the third quarter, but it sharply cut its sales forecast for the fourth quarter. Yahoo, the largest Web portal, lost $24.1 million, in contrast with a profit of $47.7 million in the period a year earlier. Its sales fell to $166.1 million, from $295.6 million in the third quarter last year.
2001-10-10	Technology Briefing | Software: Yahoo Adds An Advertising Executive	The big Internet search site Yahoo hired a former DoubleClick Inc. executive, Wenda Harris Millard, to oversee Yahoo's advertising sales, which have dwindled in the last year. Ms. Millard, 47, was named chief advertising sales officer and will be responsible for selling advertising and marketing services in North America, Yahoo said. She was previously chief Internet officer at Ziff Davis Media and president of Ziff Davis Internet. Ms. Millard, above, will report to Gregory Coleman, executive vice president for North America operations, Yahoo said. Ms. Millard replaces Anil Singh, who quit in May to pursue personal interests.
2001-09-05	4 Publishers Agree to Sale Of E-Books On Yahoo	Four major publishers have agreed to open an online clearinghouse on the Internet portal Yahoo to sell their electronic books directly to readers, advancing their efforts to liberate themselves from reliance on online retailers in the nascent business of selling books in digital form. Although almost no one is buying electronic books today, Yahoo is entering a scramble among publishers and booksellers battling to position themselves to profit from the potential future sales of their books in digital form.
2001-08-29	Technology Briefing | Internet: GeoCities Will Charge For 2 Services	Yahoo Inc.'s GeoCities unit, the biggest service that lets consumers set up their own Internet sites, said it would charge users for two new, expanded versions of its free basic service. Yahoo will charge $8.95 a month for GeoCities Pro and $11.95 a month for GeoCities Webmaster, with a $15 setup fee for both. GeoCities Pro and Webmaster provide personalized Web-site domain names, multiple e-mail accounts and more data storage than the basic service, said Mark Feldman, GeoCities' senior producer. Yahoo, whose network of Web sites is used by more than 200 million people a month, has been trying to develop new services it can charge users for, as it tries to offset a decline in advertising on its pages.
2001-08-27	Growing Audience Is Turning to Established News Media Online	The appetite for online news has continued to expand the last year, as readers, particularly younger ones, increasingly look to the Internet for a quick dose of news. And the beneficiaries of the growth in this online news audience continue to be the largest and best-known national news organizations, particularly those with a focus on national and international events. ''National sites will get more and more of a share of the news audience and the smaller sites will get less and less,'' predicted Vin Crosbie, president of the consulting firm Digital Deliverance.
2001-08-14	'Web Bugs' Are Tracking Use of Internet	Many people who have personal Web pages are unknowingly tracking people who visit and sending the information to third parties, according to a new report. The report -- which will be released today by Cyveillance, which tracks Internet sites for corporate clients -- says that the use of an Internet monitoring technology popularly known as ''Web bugs'' has exploded on personal Web pages -- especially those created free through online companies like America Online and Geocities, a company owned by Yahoo. The monitoring technology, which can be used to gather information on visitors to a Web site, is invisibly added to the Web pages as part of elements that the sites offer to help create the Web page.
2001-08-01	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Sony And Yahoo In Promotional Deal	Sony has agreed to promote its movies and sonystyle.com electronics store on Yahoo, the big Internet portal, as part of a multiyear deal. It will also create a Sony version of the My Yahoo start page that will be offered to people who buy its Vaio personal computers. This arrangement is a temporary move while Sony develops its own portal that will tie together its various offerings, including online games, music and video downloads and photo sharing. Yahoo will consult on the new portal, as well. ''We are trying to contact directly with our customers beyond the point of purchase,'' said Robert Wiesenthal, executive vice president of Sony Broadband Entertainment. He declined to specify the financial terms but noted that the value of the promotion and consulting Yahoo provides Sony are offset by the value of customers provided by Sony to Yahoo.

2001-07-26	E-Mail on Your Watch, If You've Got the Time	Back in the 1930's, when Dick Tracy phoned friends with his wristwatch telephone, high-tech dreams flooded the comics. But Dick Tracy couldn't receive an electronic message like ''Hey, Tracy: LOL! Signed, Pruneface.'' Timex's new Internet Messenger watch enables the user to receive not only baffling instant messages on his wrist but also numerical and text pages, Internet e-mail, and Yahoo updates on stocks, weather, news and sports. The watch, which costs $119, harnesses technology from Motorola and SkyTel to receive and store up to 16 messages or 1,350 total characters. Messages of up to 100 characters scroll across the bottom of the face.
2001-07-17	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Earnings Double For Yahoo	Yahoo Japan, a unit of the Softbank Corporation, reported yesterday that its earnings for the April-June period more than doubled to 1.1 billion yen while sales soared 84 percent, to 4.9 billion yen ($39.3 million), from the level a year earlier. The start of its high-speed Internet service lifted Yahoo Japan's performance as it recorded sales of broadband equipment to BB Technologies, a Softbank company, which will in turn sell the kit to subscribers to its asymmetric digital line. Yahoo Japan also said it began charging users of its auction services -- 280 yen ($2.25) a month -- in May, helping the company raise its profits. Miki Tanikawa (NYT)
2001-07-13	Corrections	An article and a headline in Business Day yesterday about financial results at Yahoo Inc. referred incorrectly in some copies to the quarter for which the company was reporting. It was the second quarter, not the first.
2001-07-12	Yahoo, Reporting a Loss, Looks for Joint Ventures	Yahoo, which was once one of the few money-making Internet companies, said yesterday that it lost $48.5 million in the second quarter. It nonetheless modestly beat its financial goals, which it had drastically reduced earlier this year as demand for Internet advertising began to plummet. After the results were released, Terry Semel, in his first public comments since becoming Yahoo's chief executive in April, said Yahoo was abandoning some if its long-held practices as it tries to find ways to make money in the current harsh environment.
2001-06-29	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Buys A Music Service	As part of its effort to expand its entertainment offerings, Yahoo said yesterday that it had acquired Launch Media, a Web music broadcast site that lets users personalize play lists. Users can also download music, read reviews and watch music videos on personal computers. The transaction was valued at $12 million, based on a price of 92 cents a share. The great popularity of Napster led many Internet companies to make investments in music services in the last year, hoping to gain a piece of a new market. Launch Media, based in Santa Monica, Calif., has 7.4 million users. Its headquarters will remain after the deal is completed. Launch Media also announced that it had settled a copyright-infringement suit brought by the Universal Music Group and other record producers in connection with Launchcast the company's Internet radio service. As part of the settlement, Launch Media will pay for past performances and will continue to use Universal recordings on a nonexclusive basis. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
2001-06-27	Technology Briefing | Internet: Congress Seeks Information On Fraud	Members of Congress yesterday asked for guidance from some of the companies that are hosts to Internet auctions -- Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com -- in assessing the prevalence of online auction fraud. Representatives Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, left, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Heather A. Wilson, Republican of New Mexico, sent letters to the chief executives of the companies in an effort to learn more about how the fraud occurs and ways to stop it. The lawmakers cited findings from a recent study by the Internet Fraud Complaint Center that showed online auction fraud accounted for about 64 percent of all fraud complaints received by the center from May to November 2000. Company officials were asked what types of fraud occurred in online auctions, what rules existed for dealing with disguised identities and if these rules might actually aid fraudulent practices, and whether certain state laws or regulations interfered with the ability to combat online fraud.
2001-06-27	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Adds Video To Instant Messaging	Yahoo is adding video capacity to its instant-messaging service, the company said yesterday. Instant messaging is one of the most popular Internet services, but Yahoo's product is used less than those of its competitors, the America Online service of AOL Time Warner and the MSN unit of Microsoft. According to Jupiter Media Metrix, AOL's downloadable instant-messaging application had 25.5 million users in May and Microsoft's service on the MSN network had 18.4 million. Yahoo had just 11.8 million users. The quality of video is expected to be low -- about one frame a second -- which is far less than regular streaming video, but is enough to let users be more expressive in their chats, said Lisa Pollock, Yahoo's messaging products director. Yahoo also entered a marketing agreement with Logitech, a maker of Webcams. Beginning in July, all Logitech Webcams sold in North America and in certain countries in Europe and Australia will be bundled with Yahoo Messenger. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
2001-06-20	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Japan High-Speed Service	Yahoo Japan, a unit of the Softbank Corporation, will offer high-speed Internet service at sharply reduced prices starting this month in Tokyo and spreading to the rest of the country in August. Working with a broadband service company, BB Technologies, that is also owned by Softbank, Yahoo Japan will offer the high-speed asymmetric digital subscriber line, or A.D.S.L., connection for a monthly rate of 2,280 yen ($18.55), about half that charged by its Japanese rivals. Miki Tanikawa (NYT)
2001-06-14	Messengers That Carry Big Bundles	THE first time I heard of an instant message was in 1994, when an old friend suggested that we stop blasting e-mail back and forth across America Online and have a proper online chat. The next night, when I booted up my Mac at the agreed hour and signed on to AOL, a tiny window popped up so my friend could say, ''Hey.'' We proceeded to spend two hours, he in Iowa and I in New York, in what can only be called a state of Intense I.M. Seven years later, with Internet connections as necessary as food, coffee and ''Sex and the City'' boxed sets for many people, much of the online world seems to be in a state of Intense I.M. Several free instant-message programs from competing companies have appeared. But one thing hamstringing a full-blown communications revolution is that the people using one service generally find it impossible to exchange instant messages with people on other systems. (And that is a big problem -- imagine how popular e-mail would be if people had to have the same Internet service provider to communicate.) There is a movement afoot to create a fully interoperable instant-message system, but for now, the services are still essentially walled off.
2001-06-05	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Yahoo To Sell Consumer Reports Research	Yahoo, operator of the most-visited site for Internet searches, will sell Consumer Reports buying guides online and get an undisclosed share of sales from the magazine's publisher. General information about cars and other products will be offered free, Yahoo and Consumers Union said in a statement. Detailed reports with performance ratings will cost $2.95.
2001-06-04	Clicks for Sale; Paid Placement Is Catching On in Web Searches	Even for Bill Gross, the impetuous Internet impresario who created short-lived concepts like Free-PC.com, the idea for GoTo.com seemed far-fetched. In 1998, Mr. Gross's Idealab introduced GoTo.com as a search engine with a difference: Web sites would pay to be included in the search results after a user entered key words. If someone conducted a search for ''roses,'' for instance, the florists who paid for a listing would be sure to be included -- the higher the fee, the higher up the list. The idea was widely ridiculed and reviled as tantamount to having politicians pay to place flattering news articles on the front page of a newspaper.
2001-05-30	Technology Briefing | Internet: Equity Options For Yahoo Chief	Terry Semel, who officially began as Yahoo's chief executive on May 1, was given a compensation package that included options to buy 10 million shares, or just less than 2 percent of the company, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The Internet company named Mr. Semel, a longtime Hollywood executive, its chairman and chief executive on April 17, and that day he bought a million Yahoo shares with his own money. Mr. Semel's options were granted on his first day of employment, when the stock closed at $22.31. Yahoo shares fell $2.13, or 10.2 percent, to $18.79 yesterday. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
2001-05-16	Yahoo Goes Beyond Initial Plan Against Adult Sites	A month after Yahoo, the Internet service, eliminated a section that offered pornographic videos from its shopping area, the company has begun making it harder for users to find sexually explicit chat rooms and clubs. The action has sparked anger and fear among users, prompting thousands of them to sign a petition demanding that the company continue to maintain the popular online forums. One Web site created to protest Yahoo's move has gone so far as to accuse the company of a widespread purge.
2001-05-10	Ban on Nazi Items Upsets Collectors	MIKE PETERS, an avid collector of artifacts from World War II, was once an enthusiastic user of online auctions. Every day, he logged on to Yahoo Auctions or eBay and trolled for uniforms, helmets, medals, flags, bayonets and books. Sometimes he would come across items that had belonged to Nazi soldiers, and he would snap them up, proud to fill a gap in his collection. Those sources have all but dried up for Mr. Peters. In the past year, both Yahoo Auctions and eBay have taken steps to prohibit members from selling any items, except coins and stamps, with Nazi insignia. Officials for both companies say the rules were in response to complaints that auction services were making money from Nazi memorabilia and from reproductions of Nazi artifacts.
2001-05-03	Corrections	A front-page article on Tuesday about the decline of free offerings on Web sites misstated the cost of storing e-mail on Yahoo. The $20 charge is for only those users who store more than six megabytes of e-mail; for others, the service remains free. The article also misstated the charge that Salon.com is considering. David Talbot, Salon's chairman, said that for the entire site, his company might charge more than the $30 a year it now costs for the premium section alone. He did not say the charge would be $75 to $150 a year.
2001-05-01	Free Rides Are Now Passé On Information Highway	There never was such a thing as a free lunch over the Internet. But for a while a determined freeloader could find a Web site that would pick up the tab for all sorts of other goods and services, from computer keyboards to photo developing, in return for little more than looking at a few ads. No more.
2001-04-18	Yahoo Turns to Hollywood for a Chief	Terry Semel, a former Hollywood executive responsible for hit movies ranging in style from ''Batman'' to ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' was named yesterday as chairman and chief executive of Yahoo, the big but reeling Internet site. With Robert A. Daly, Mr. Semel ran the Warner Brothers studio for 20 years, creating a track record of hits based on big-budget pictures and brand-name stars like Tom Cruise and Clint Eastwood. The two executives left the studio at the end of 1999 after a long dispute with Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive of what is now AOL Time Warner.
2001-04-17	Corrections	An article and a picture caption in Business Day on Saturday about Yahoo's decision to remove pornographic material from its site misspelled the surname of its president. He is Jeffrey Mallett, not Mallet.
2001-04-12	Yahoo Reports Quarterly Loss And Schedules Round of Cuts	Yahoo, the big but beleagured Internet service, reported its first quarterly loss in nearly two years yesterday and said it would lay off 12 percent of its work force of 3,510. It also announced a variety of other cost-cutting moves, including paring marketing expenses and eliminating some parts of its sprawling service.
2001-04-06	Sony and Universal Agree to Sell Their Songs on Yahoo	Punctuating a week of new alliances between major record companies and Internet companies, Sony Music and Universal Music said today that they planned to make their vast catalogs of music available by subscription over Yahoo. The two music companies, which operate a joint venture called Duet, said they planned to start the subscription service this summer, allowing users to listen to songs over the Internet or possibly download them onto their computers.
2001-04-05	YAHOO AND SAP FORM WEB SITE VENTURE	Yahoo, the popular Internet Web site, and SAP, the German business software giant, are setting up a joint venture to market Internet portals to businesses. The alliance is intended to combine the marketing reach of the two companies in the highly competitive field of designing gateways to corporate Web sites. Such portals are intended to help customers, investors and employees gain access to information and corporate computer applications linked to the site. Barnaby J. Feder
2001-04-04	YAHOO FILLS MANAGEMENT POSTS	Three top management positions have been filled by Yahoo. Norman Hullinger will start in mid-April as vice president and general manager of Yahoo Auctions, the company said. George Williams joined last month as vice president and general manager of Yahoo Finance. And Tiana Wimmer joined this month as general manager of direct marketing.
2001-03-21	YAHOO FILLS A TOP POST	Yahoo Inc. said yesterday that Gregory G. Coleman, who most recently worked as a top executive at Reader's Digest, would become its executive vice president for North American operations. In the newly created position, Mr. Coleman will be responsible for sales, marketing and client service, as well as Yahoo's consumer and programming initiatives. He will join the company in late April and report to Jeffrey Mallett, Yahoo's president and chief operating officer. At Reader's Digest, where he was senior vice president, Mr. Coleman oversaw all advertising, circulation, production, customer service and financial initiatives for the magazine division. Several top executives have left Yahoo recently, including Anil Singh, its chief marketing executive, and Timothy Koogle, its chief executive. Andrew Zipern
2001-03-18	Corrections	An article last Sunday about Yahoo misstated the percentage of advertising space on its Web pages that represented unpaid ads for Yahoo itself during February and December, as measured by AdRelevance, a New York research firm. The firm found that a quarter of Yahoo's space in February was unpaid, not three-quarters; and 15 percent was unpaid in December, not 85 percent. A picture caption misstated Jeffrey Mallett's first role with Yahoo. He was recruited as chief operating officer in 1995 from Novell, where he had been a vice president. He did not help start Yahoo while he was a student.
2001-03-15	TOP YAHOO SALES EXECUTIVE LEAVING	Yahoo Inc. announced yesterday that Anil Singh, the company's chief marketing executive, will retire in May. The announcement comes less than a week after Yahoo announced that its chief executive, Timothy Koogle, would step down and disclosed that its first-quarter financial results would miss analysts' forecasts. Mr. Singh, 42, went to work at Yahoo in 1995, when the company had only 20 employees. He is credited with championing online advertising when electronic commerce was a virtually untested concept. The company said Mr. Singh, above, was resigning to spend more time with his family. Yahoo, which is based in San Jose, Calif., has not named a replacement. Laurie J. Flynn
2001-03-15	Welcome to the Web. Passport, Please?	LAST fall, a French judge named Jean-Jacques Gomez made Internet history, and attracted a flock of critics, when he ordered the Yahoo Web site to prevent French residents from viewing Nazi memorabilia in its online auctions. To Yahoo, the appearance of Nazi uniforms and other objects was simply an unintended byproduct of the borderless Internet: the items, which were being offered by sellers all over the world, happened to be on French computer screens.
2001-03-11	A Cautious Sibling Waits to See What Works	YAHOO Inc. may be stumbling, but its younger Japanese sibling has been doing relatively well. Part of the reason is that the Yahoo Japan Corporation has learned a few things from its American counterpart's mistakes. Amid global turmoil in the Internet sector, Yahoo Japan has emerged a ruler of the Internet here. For the quarter that ended on Dec. 31, Yahoo Japan reported a 152.5 percent increase in profits on a 130 percent increase in revenue. Many analysts expect that pace of growth to continue, given Yahoo Japan's relatively low dependence on dot-com advertising and its growing revenue from old-economy advertisers like travel agents and restaurants.
2001-03-11	Red Face For the Internet's Blue Chip	ET tu, Yahoo? If there is an Internet blue chip, Yahoo is it. Lesser Web sites have come and gone. Amazon.com loses money by the crateload. Industry titans that rushed to e-themselves are now retreating.
2001-03-08	Yahoo Warns on Sales, and Its Chief Resigns	Timothy A. Koogle resigned yesterday as the chief executive of Yahoo, as the company warned that its sales in the first quarter would be far worse than its pessimistic prediction in January. Yahoo, which serves 185 million users, is the biggest Internet company that mainly derives revenue from advertising and one of the few that earns a profit.
2001-02-27	Yahoo to Offer H&R Block Services	Yahoo Inc. said today that H&R Block Inc. had agreed to provide tax information and filing services for Yahoo's online tax center. H&R Block, the tax preparation service, will offer a basic filing service for $19.95, reviews of tax returns for $29.95 and its professional preparation service starting at $99.95 on the Yahoo Finance Web site, the companies said. Financial terms were not disclosed.
2001-02-21	YAHOO EXPANDING WIRELESS SERVICE	The big search engine company Yahoo said yesterday that it had started to let users of Internet-enabled wireless telecommunications devices search for localized information. Yahoo Local Info allows users to search by street address, Zip code, city or state for information like concert and sports event listings, business directories and restaurant reviews, the company said.
2001-02-16	YAHOO EUROPEAN HEAD QUITS	Yahoo said that Fabiola Arredondo, the chief of its European operations, resigned to pursue other business interests. A replacement was not named. Mr. Arredondo, whose title was Yahoo Europe managing director, will leave before the end of this quarter, after helping with the transition, a spokeswoman said. Yahoo's president, Jeffrey Mallett, will take a greater role in Yahoo Europe until a replacement for Mr. Arredondo is named.
2001-01-29	New Economy; Yahoo charts the spread of the news by e-mail, and what it finds out is itself becoming news.	WAS last week's biggest news story President Bush's education plan? Or was it the study contending that American men may have smaller penises, on average, than Brazilian men? One story dominated headlines; the other was forwarded frantically around the Net. And the episode provided insight into the role of the Web audience in determining, and maybe even increasing, the market value of information once it goes online.
2001-01-23	ONLINE ADS CLIMB TO RECORD	Online advertising impressions increased 21 percent in December 2000 over the previous month, reaching a record high of more than 65 billion, despite increasingly negative perceptions of the online advertising industry, according to a report by AdRelevance in New York, part of Jupiter Media Metrix. According to the report, Yahoo led all sites with more than 7.5 billion ad impressions during December 2000. MSN brought in the most ad revenue that month, $180 million, with an average of $486,000 in revenue per advertiser. Amazon.com led all online advertisers in ad spending with more than $61.8 million, 42 percent of which was on MSN. Allison Fass (NYT)
2001-01-19	GAINS FORECAST FOR ONLINE ADS	There ''are still plenty of signs of hope'' for online advertising, despite the widespread decline among dot-com marketers, Melissa Gluck, senior analyst at Jupiter Communications, part of Jupiter Media Metrix, said yesterday at an industry conference organized by the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers. She estimated that online advertising would climb to $7.3 billion this year, from $5.3 billion in 2000, and reach $16.5 billion by 2005. Advertising for products like automobiles, health and travel would compensate for reduced spending by dot-coms, Ms. Gluck predicted. Jeffrey Mallett, above, chief operating officer at Yahoo, agreed that ''traditional companies are finally stepping up'' to buy ads online. He noted that more than two-thirds of Yahoo's 15,000 clients a month were traditional companies. The conference, the first event jointly sponsored by the two groups, continues through this afternoon at the Hilton New York. Stuart Elliott (NYT)
2001-01-12	Primer on the Popular Instant Messaging Services	Instant messaging has much in common with two other big uses of the Internet: Web surfing and e-mail. Tens of millions of people spend hours using it -- often while at work -- but it remains unclear whether the companies that provide the service can ever make money from it.
2001-01-11	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Yahoo Warns Of Sharp Drop In Earnings	Facing a slowdown in the overall economy and devastation among Internet companies, Yahoo said yesterday that its profits would fall 10 to 30 percent this year, a sharp reversal from the 34 percent growth that analysts had expected. The company just barely met analysts' expectations of operating profit of 13 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2000, with revenue slightly below expectations. But it said sales and profits would drop sharply in the first part of this year.
2001-01-07	Ideas & Trends; Hemming in the World Wide Web	IF the Internet is anything, at least according to its prophets, it is a place without boundaries. Real world geography, with tiresome passports and tedious border checkpoints, does not matter. This is not an appealing notion to many of the world's governments, which would much prefer to control the flow of information across their national borders, just as they try to control the flow of everything else, from people to money. Their distaste for borderlessness, in fact, may soon give cyberspace the same jigsaw-puzzle appearance as the terrestrial world.
2001-01-03	Yahoo to Try Harder to Rid Postings of Hateful Material	After months of pressure from human rights groups like the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Yahoo said yesterday that it would try more actively to keep hateful and violent material out of its auctions, classified sections and shopping areas. The program, which will employ human reviewers and software, signals a shift in Yahoo's approach. Previously, the company did not actively monitor what was posted on its site, and it removed material that was deemed inappropriate or in violation of its policies only after such a posting was brought to its attention by users or watchdog groups.
2000-12-25	Corrections	A report in the Technology Briefing column of Business Day on Friday about Yahoo's objection to a French court's judgment against the company over the sale of Nazi-related material on its auction sites misstated the effective date of the fines. It is 90 days after the judgment is served in the United States, not 180 days.
2000-12-22	YAHOO SEEKS TO BLOCK JUDGMENT	Yahoo has asked a federal judge to declare that a French court's recent judgment against the company cannot be enforced in the United States. That judgment, issued in November, ordered Yahoo to block Nazi-related material from appearing on auction sites in France or face daily fines of 100,000 francs, about $13,800. French law prohibits the sale and display of racist material. Yahoo, based in Santa Clara, Calif., filed the request in federal court in San Jose, Calif. The company argued that the order violated the First Amendment and that enforcement was inappropriate because the posted material was not intended for French viewers. Officials for the company have also argued that it is technically impossible to block French citizens from viewing material on Yahoo's United States site, www.yahoo.com. The fines will take effect 180 days after the judgment is served in the United States, which Yahoo officials expect in the next few weeks. Lisa Guernsey (NYT)
2000-12-14	Hate on the Web	To the Editor: While censorship is never pleasant, Yahoo should be willing to exercise reasonable discretion in eliminating sites that sponsor a message of hate including violence and even murder (''Mainstream Sites Serve as Portals to Hate,'' Nov. 30). Its unwillingness to do so may ultimately lead to justifiable lawsuits for being an accessory to crimes of hate not only in the United States but overseas.
2000-12-11	In Search for Online Success, 'Easy Does It' Is Good Theme	In the beginning there was a gray void and onto it were black letters. Some of the letters became blue and were underlined. These were links, and they begat other links. And so were the very first Web pages models of brutish simplicity -- raw information and links to more information.
2000-11-30	Mainstream Sites Serve as Portals to Hate	EARLIER this month, in a cramped airport lounge in San Jose, Calif., two seemingly unrelated parties sat down to talk about hate. On one side of a conference table sat researchers from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization in Los Angeles dedicated to the marginalization of groups like the Ku Klux Klan. On the other sat representatives of Yahoo, arguably the most popular site on the Web and, at that moment, home to dozens of online clubs with names like White Knights of the K.K.K.
2000-11-21	French Uphold Ruling Against Yahoo on Nazi Sites	Upholding a verdict that has unsettled the Internet industry in France for the last seven months, a court here ruled today that Yahoo must prevent World Wide Web users in France from visiting its auction sites that sell Nazi memorabilia, or face heavy fines for each day that it did not comply. Lawyers for Yahoo, who have argued that such steps are technically not feasible, said they would study ways to appeal the decision.
2000-11-13	E-Commerce Report; Portals are eager to make more attractive advertising deals with e-tailers.	WHEN the sky began falling on dot-com companies this year, e-commerce sages predicted good things for businesses strong enough to hold on through the holidays. Not only would there be less competition for customers, the thinking went, but e-tailers would be able to negotiate better business terms from manufacturers and vendors, whose client lists had evaporated. An early case in point may be coming from e-tailers and their relationships with portal sites like Yahoo, America Online and others. From 1998 until this spring, these and other portals signed multiyear, multimillion-dollar advertising contracts with a long list of e-tailers -- dot-coms that in many cases signed the deals at the urging of their venture capitalist backers.
2000-11-10	YAHOO BUYS TAIWAN PORTAL COMPANY	The big Internet portal Yahoo said it had agreed to acquire Kimo.com, a Taiwan Web site, from the Systex Corporation for $132.3 million in stock. The acquisition is part of Yahoo's strategy to bolster its offerings in Taiwan and China as it tries to gain market share there. Jerry Yang, Yahoo's co-founder, said the deal reflected the company's commitment to pursuing growth abroad. Andrew Ross Sorkin (NYT)
2000-11-07	HACKING SUSPECT CASE ADVANCES	A Montreal judge yesterday scheduled a December court hearing for a 16-year-old boy accused of sabotaging prominent Web sites like Yahoo, Amazon, eBay and Dell. The suspect, who cannot be publicly identified because of his age, is accused of hijacking computers at leading universities in the United States and then using them to attack popular Web sites.

2000-10-11	Yahoo Beats Earnings Estimates, but Sees Potholes on the Road Ahead	Under close scrutiny from jittery technology investors, Yahoo posted quarterly earnings today that narrowly beat expectations, but the company also suggested that failures and scaling back among dot-com advertisers had limited growth and might continue to do so. The company reported earnings of $82 million, or 13 cents a share, one penny more than analysts' projections, and just more than double the company's earnings of 6 cents a share for the period a year earlier.
2000-10-10	YAHOO TO OFFER PHONE-BASED SERVICES	Yahoo plans to announce today that it will offer new services directed through a telephone rather than a computer. To that end, Yahoo intends to use a network built by Net2Phone, which transmits telephone calls using Internet technology. Under the brand Yahoo by Phone, Yahoo intends to give consumers access to personalized information and e-mail by calling a toll-free number. Using Net2Phone's network, Yahoo will also offer free voice mail and free phone calls from computers to standard telephones in the continental United States. Seth Schiesel
2000-09-19	Bookseller and Yahoo to Announce Pact	After being pilloried by investors for failing to capitalize on its parent company's 550 stores and well-known brand, the three-year-old online spinoff Barnesandnoble.com is making its biggest bid yet to woo the chain's customers through a marketing agreement with the Web portal Yahoo, which will provide free Internet access to Barnes & Noble customers. The deal, which is expected to be announced today, will also significantly bolster Barnesandnoble.com's exposure on the Web by making it the most prominent bookseller on the Yahoo site. Yahoo is the most popular site on the Web. Barnesandnoble.com replaces Amazon.com, which did not renew its three-year marketing pact with Yahoo. Barnesandnoble.com will also sell books, music and videos in Yahoo's online shopping network, paying Yahoo an undisclosed commission on its sales.
2000-09-15	RIDING THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY	A fleet of 10 Internet-enabled taxis hit the streets of New York yesterday in a venture between Yahoo; Team Systems, a large taxi fleet operator; and Medallion Financial, which provides loans for taxi operators. The purple and yellow taxis, with purple upholstery, are equipped with Palm hand-held computers, offering passengers access to the Internet at no extra cost. ''This will be a great opportunity for taxi passengers to stay on top of their business and personal lives while riding in the comfort of a taxicab,'' said Andrew Murstein, president of Medallion Financial. The venture, which follows a similar effort by Yahoo in San Francisco, is part of a trend by many companies. Simon Romero (NYT)
2000-08-30	NEW VERTICALONE BUSINESS	VerticalOne, a unit of the S1 Corporation, is expected to announce today that it will provide account-aggregation services to Yahoo and to Wells Fargo bank, allowing them to provide a single place on the Internet where their customers can keep all of their financial data, like the balances in their bank and brokerage accounts, frequent-flier programs and credit cards. Patrick McGeehan
2000-08-14	The Medium Gets The Message; TV's Monoliths Have Learned The Web Is a Fragmented World	If there were any established companies ready-made for the Internet, they should have been the big television networks. Or at least that was how it seemed two years ago. ''We have what is needed to compete because of the great depth in our brands and the great consumer loyalty to them,'' Michael D. Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, said in 1998 on the eve of the debut of Disney's Go Network.
2000-08-12	FURTHER QUERIES IN YAHOO CASE	A French court seeking to decide whether Yahoo violated French law by allowing Nazi memorabilia to be sold on Web sites accessible through its American portal ordered a team of three international experts to examine whether it is possible to make such sites originating in the United States inaccessible in France. In May, the court upheld a complaint about Yahoo Web sites advertising Nazi paraphernalia like uniforms and weapons. But Yahoo appealed the verdict, arguing it is technically impossible to identify Web users by national origin and block their access to sites. John Tagliabue

It will sell its products and services and offer recommendations through AltaVista Shopping, and it will become a featured store on the Yahoo Shopping channel. Marcin Skomial (NYT)
2000-07-12	Yahoo Reports That Earnings Beat Estimates by a Penny	Yahoo announced better-than-expected quarterly earnings today, quelling investor concerns that consolidation and business failures among struggling dot-coms might hurt its revenue base. Yahoo reported net income of $65.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, or 11 cents a share, compared with analysts' consensus projections of 10 cents a share. Revenue was $270.1 million, exceeding analysts' estimates of $240 million, and up from $128.6 million a year ago.
2000-06-02	Yahoo Wins Round in Credit Card Case	Yahoo Inc. has convinced a federal judge to lift a temporary restraining order barring the company, the No. 1 Internet portal, from blocking the electronic mail account of a subscriber who refused to provide his credit card number. At a hearing yesterday, the United States District Judge Richard Owen concluded that Yahoo, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., had a valid reason for demanding credit card information from customers who register for e-mail accounts - specifically, verification that account holders are adults.
2000-05-01	E-Commerce Report; Many analysts think the old-style expensive portal deals deserve more scrutiny from e-tailers.	FOR the last two years, Web portals, the jumping-off sites for many Internet surfers, have grabbed a piece of the e-commerce pie by offering retailers prime real estate on their sites. In exchange, the portals receive stratospheric tenancy fees. Sites like Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Excite, Lycos, AltaVista and Go flourished, as retailers fought for top billing within the portals' shopping categories. In the frenzy of dot-com investment last year, those deals cost merchants like Drugstore.com, Pets.com and Value America between $2 million and $5 million for every portal they signed with.
2000-04-23	The Maniac Markets; An Earnings Engine	Shares of Yahoo may have fallen from a high of 240 on Dec. 31 to barely half that level last week, but the company's fans are as confident as ever in its future. Never mind that even at its current levels, Yahoo, the leading Internet portal, has a market valuation of more than $70 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 279.2. Never mind that even if Yahoo's earnings rise 50 percent a year for the next five years and its stock stays flat, Yahoo will still have a P/E ratio of near 40 in 2005. Yahoo may be expensive, but investors get what they pay for, analysts and money managers say.
2000-04-23	The Maniac Markets; Seeking Solid Ground Amid Falling Bodies	BLUE chips? Or wooden nickels?

2000-04-20	Untangling The Web's Languages	THE idea of the Internet as the ultimate global village -- the medium that will allow people around the world to connect and communicate -- may be facing its ultimate test. As the community of non-English-speaking people grows online, companies are racing to handle the numerous languages of the World Wide Web. The demographics of the Internet are changing fast. Non-English speakers make up nearly half of the online population, researchers say. As a result, companies are looking for ways to allow these people to communicate in their native tongues. One of the obstacles making it hard to reach that goal has been the inadequacy of machine translation services and multilingual communication tools.
2000-04-20	Canada Arrests 15-Year-Old In Web Attack	Canadian law enforcement officials said yesterday that they had arrested a Montreal high school student in one of the computer attacks that crippled some of the Internet's biggest sites in February, exposing deep vulnerabilities in the fledgling world of electronic commerce. The 15-year-old suspect, whom the authorities identified only by the online nickname Mafiaboy, was accused of conducting an attack against Cable News Network's Web site. He is the first to face charges in the onslaught that hindered access to the World Wide Web sites of Yahoo, eBay and E*Trade, among others, and forced hundreds of other big-name sites to shore up their defenses against an invisible and far-flung threat.
2000-04-17	2 Companies Take Separate Paths To Speed Delivery of Web Pages	Here's news: Some of the Internet's uncertainties have nothing to do with stock prices. Take the vagaries of surfing the Web, for example. Anyone who has ever watched a complex Web page paint itself onto the computer screen, image by grudgingly slow image, can attest that the World Wide Web should be faster. On that simple proposition there is virtually unanimous agreement.
2000-04-06	Yahoo's 1st-Quarter Earnings Exceeded Analyst Predictions	Buoyed by accelerating growth overseas, Yahoo posted stronger-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter. Yahoo, the No. 2 Internet service, said that it earned $78 million in the first quarter, up from $1.8 million a year earlier. Yahoo said it preferred that investors look at its own calculation of ''pro-forma'' profit, which excludes a $41 million investment gain as well as acquisition-related charges and payroll taxes it paid when employees exercised certain stock options. By that measure, the company earned $63 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with $18 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier.
2000-04-03	E-Commerce Report; Running a joint promotion with Yahoo, Pepsi is in the Internet generation.	PEPSICO'S recent announcement that it would conduct a joint promotion of its products with Yahoo, one of the most popular sites on the Internet, is promising news for Web site operators that have struggled to persuade the richest advertisers to spend their money online. Even as the Internet achieved mass-market audience levels, consumer goods advertisers like Coca-Cola, Nabisco and -- until now -- PepsiCo, have kept their wallets shut, spending mere pocket change on the Web. They have argued that the medium may be great for direct marketing, but it does little to advance their primary advertising goal: increasing brand awareness.
2000-03-29	Yahoo Seeking to Avoid Mutual Fund Status	Yahoo Inc. has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to exempt the company from regulation as a mutual fund, a request that could set a precedent for other Web businesses. Yahoo risks falling under the legal definition of a mutual fund because it holds stock in other Web companies that have soared to such values they represent at least three-quarters of Yahoo's total assets.

2000-03-16	You Want to Be in Pictures? Will You Settle for a Web Page?	WHILE just a few years ago it might have been akin to owning a Lear jet, having your own Web page these days is about as exciting as having your own e-mail address. But if you really want one, whether to show off family photos or to plug a new business, there is plenty of room still available in cyberspace. Internet service providers like America Online, Earthlink, AT&T WorldNet Service and Juno Web offer an easy and fast way to create and publish Web pages. Most offer 5 to 15 megabytes of storage space for the pages they hold on their servers. That is more than enough to accommodate several pages with images and text.
2000-03-03	Charges Expected in Attack on a Web Site	The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized a computer two weeks ago from a 17-year-old New Hampshire resident who the Los Angeles Police Department said tonight would be charged in connection with attacks on the Web site of an antidrug organization. But a federal law enforcement official who asked not to be identified said tonight that the teenage hacker, who goes by the nickname Coolio, was not a suspect in last month's attacks on Yahoo, eBay and other major e-commerce Web sites.

The two companies are interested in joining forces to counter the recently announced merger of America Online and Time Warner. But the executives said any deal was probably weeks away at best.
2000-02-17	How Not To Be A Zombie	IN the 1977 film ''Telefon,'' dozens of otherwise ordinary Good Guy citizens were secretly hypnotized and brainwashed by the Bad Guys. They lived and worked among their fellow Good Guys for months or years. Then one day, a simple telephone call from the Bad Guys triggered these pre-programmed Good Guys to stop whatever they were doing and, like zombies, to start attacking military bases and assassinating their own leaders. It is a brilliant science fiction concept, so brilliant, in fact, that it has been copied by computer hackers in the recent wave of attacks against well-known Internet commerce companies like Yahoo, Amazon.com, eBay, Buy.com, E-Trade and CNN.com.
2000-02-13	Secure or Not, the Internet Has Become a Part of Life's Routine	When Jon Tara first heard that unknown vandals with unclear motives had managed to sabotage several of the Internet's most prominent businesses last week, the San Diego software engineer posted a probing message to an online investing forum that he frequents. ''Is this the end of Internet innocence? Is the house of cards about to crumble?'' Mr. Tara, 45, wondered. ''Can we move to an Internet-based economy while the potential exists for a group of hackers to bring it to its knees at any time?''
2000-02-11	Online Fingerpointing Finds Suspects Everywhere	Lacking information about who has been attacking some of the biggest sites on the Internet, cyberkibitzers have been busy nominating suspects in chat rooms, electronic bulletin boards and mass e-mailings. Teenage hackers, the government, foreign terrorists and the owners of the Web sites themselves are mentioned repeatedly as having ideological or economic motives for overwhelming various sites with traffic, thus denying service to millions trying to use them. And while hackers were the main suspects in most published reports, it was the federal government that raised eyebrows in the chat rooms.
2000-02-11	Web Attacks Have Government Revisiting Laws and Security	Expressing concern about the economic damage, including sell-offs in the stock market, caused by the attacks on leading Web sites this week, the Justice Department said today that tougher criminal penalties might be necessary to prevent malicious disruption of Internet commerce. ''We don't consider this a prank,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said today at a news conference. ''These are very serious matters.''
2000-02-11	Web Attacks Might Have Many Sources	Computer security experts said today that evidence now suggests that the three days of attacks on leading Web sites may have been the work of more than one person or group. The analysis that more than one group was at work called into question the conclusion of some security experts who were initially skeptical that following Monday's attack on Yahoo, multiple vandals would have been able to muster large ''copy cat'' assaults on other sites.
2000-02-10	Companies Won't Say if They Were Insured for Net Attacks	Yahoo, eBay and other companies whose Web sites came under attack this week would not say yesterday whether they carried insurance to cover their losses. The few insurers that specialize in e-commerce often request that clients not discuss specifics of the policies, which were developed over the last couple of years, for fear of inviting attacks.

2000-02-09	Several Web Sites Attacked Following Assault on Yahoo	SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8 -- Hackers mounted what appeared to be coordinated attacks on the world's largest electronic commerce sites today. The attacks, which opened a window on the widespread vulnerability of the Internet, began Monday with a three-hour assault on Yahoo.com, one of the world's most popular Web sites, and continued today, temporarily crippling at least four other major sites, including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com. By tonight it had spread to a leading media site, CNN.com.
2000-02-08	Yahoo Blames a Hacker Attack for a Lengthy Service Failure	Yahoo Inc. blamed a ''planned attack'' by computer hackers for a service failure that lasted nearly three hours today, in a rare interruption of one of the most popular and best performing sites on the World Wide Web. The company attributed the failure to an attack in which one or more hackers flooded a network with a steady stream of data, causing the network to become clogged.
2000-01-17	America Online Deal Will Put More Pressure on Internet Rivals	Four years ago, when Barbara Ransford happily reported that she was now on the Internet, having just signed up with America Online, her son-in-law, Bill Joy, was quick to correct her. Mr. Joy, a Sun Microsystems co-founder who helped build the Internet in the 1970's, explained that America Online was actually a proprietary network that allowed access to the Internet. ''This was a level of detail that didn't matter to her,'' recalled Mr. Joy. ''She wanted me to meet her on a chat list. I told her it didn't work on my computer.''
2000-01-12	Yahoo Plans To Remain Independent	Yahoo, the leading Web portal company, reaffirmed its plans to remain independent yesterday even as it reported another quarter of spectacular growth. Monday's merger between America Online and Time Warner has put the spotlight on whether Yahoo, which in half a decade has become a force on the Web and one of the world's most valuable companies, will merge with a traditional media company like Walt Disney or even a cable or phone company. But on a conference call with investors to discuss their quarterly results, executives at Yahoo said the company could remain successful without a merger.
2000-01-11	When Everything New Becomes Dizzingly Newer	The combination of America Online and Time Warner would create a colossus that could force competitors from the Walt Disney Company to AT&T to Microsoft to reconsider their strategies. The deal, announced yesterday, leaves Disney, the News Corporation, Seagram, NBC, Viacom-CBS and other, smaller old-media companies with a stark choice. They can try to carve a future alone on the Internet, a place that has so far been inhospitable to old-media companies. Or they can merge with new- media companies like Yahoo, putting their future in the hands of businesses that hardly existed five years ago.
1999-12-16	Kmart Is Joining Yahoo in Deal to Create New Internet Shopping Site	The Kmart Corporation said yesterday that it was teaming up with the Internet portal company Yahoo to create a new company that will provide free access to the Internet and a co-branded shopping site. Kmart, looking to vault its lackluster Web store into the front ranks of e-commerce competitors, is counting on Yahoo's popularity as well as a suite of services like free e-mail to attract traffic to the new venture. Yahoo is betting that access to the discounter's enormous customer base -- both through its stores and its detailed database of shoppers' habits -- will enable it to become a top site among mass-market consumers, a last untapped source of potential Web users.
1999-12-12	Better Late Than Never	Five years ago, when Larry Augustin was a graduate student at Stanford, his friends David Filo and Jerry Yang came up with a directory to the World Wide Web that they ultimately called Yahoo. At one point, the three, all computer science students, talked about writing a joint business plan. But Mr. Augustin bowed out, going on to earn his doctorate there in electrical engineering.
1999-12-02	Big Names Lead in Holiday Internet Sales	Already, Internet merchants as a group are having a merry holiday. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, numerous online vendors, including Yahoo and Toysrus.com, reported their biggest days of the year. Internet retailing accounts for only a tiny portion of total Christmas spending, but it is growing rapidly, tripling by the year. Shop.org, the industry association of Internet retailers, released a survey yesterday of its members predicting that about $9 billion will be spent on the Internet between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31.
1999-11-28	Ideas & Trends; Searching for the Search Engines of Meaning	I can't remember what I was looking for; it was something easy to find on the World Wide Web, a fact or a song lyric or a recipe. The original search topic was quickly forgotten when the search engine replied with a non sequitur: ''Altavista knows the answer to this question: What is the meaning of life?'' When had the search for Web sites turned into the search for meaning? How many clicks away was the meaning of life? And what else did Altavista know?
1999-11-21	Bidding for the Auctioneer Is Right Up Their Alley	Haven't seen enough of Meg Whitman, the high-profile chief executive of on-line auctioneer eBay? If profiles in Business Week, Glamour and Vanity Fair left you begging for more, maybe you should consider bowling. Earlier this month, Butterfield & Butterfield, the old-time San Francisco auction house that was recently acquired by eBay, auctioned off a bowling date with Ms. Whitman and two eBay employees. Twenty-nine bids were submitted over 10 days to raise money for the San Francisco chapter of the American Red Cross. The first bid was a mere $75, but, like everything related to the Internet, the price soared, to $11,600. The lucky bidder? A group from Yahoo's auc
1999-11-15	Net Investors Wary About Trade Talks With China	As the United States and China continued marathon negotiations today on China's possible entry into the World Trade Organization, nobody watched the to-and-fro more anxiously than entrepreneurs and investors in the Internet. China's Internet industry has been in a state of suspension since September, when the nation's top communications official suddenly reaffirmed a longstanding ban on foreign investment in Chinese Internet service providers. While any trade agreement was not expected to deal specifically with the Internet, analysts said it could clarify Beijing's stance toward its bubbling online industry.
1999-11-04	Free Software Sounds Alerts On Sites' Use of Personal Data	Amazon.com may have attracted 13 million shoppers, but how many of them really know what the company plans to do with their personal information? That is the question asked by Enonymous.com, a new company that wants to give Web surfers a more complete picture of exactly how sites plan to use their names, e-mail addresses and any other information they collect. The company, in San Diego, is distributing a free Internet utility called Enonymous Advisor. A computer equipped with the Advisor, which can be downloaded from www.enonymous.com, detects sites that request personal information. When a fill-in-the-blank form is opened on a user's Web browser, a window pops up with information about how the site rates on consumer privacy. The ratings are based on Enonymous's evaluation of the site's privacy policies.
1999-10-31	DAVID FILO	He doesn't sleep under his desk any more, but David Filo, the co-founder of Yahoo, the world's most popular Web site, spends a lot of time in his cubicle at the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. Several times each day, Mr. Filo uses one of his company's most popular creations -- My Yahoo -- to keep up with what's going on in the world. My Yahoo lets users create a page with their most used features in one place. Mr. Filo has a typical mix of news headlines, stock quotes and links to some of Yahoo's various services, like its instant message network. And Mr. Filo has modified the page to keep tabs on some of his interests like sports and jazz. But he concedes these areas are more reminders of his passions in earlier days.
1999-10-07	On-Line Help for Inquiring Young Minds	YAHOOLIGANS www.yahooligans.com YAHOOLIGANS looks like a junior version of its parent site at Yahoo, with a home page that has both a prominent query box and a list of general categories that you can click on to start delving into more specific topics. Information is organized in a manner that mimics Yahoo as well; when a user submits a query, it searches for answers from among its own proprietary directory of sites, which have been screened and organized by category, topic and subtopic.
1999-10-07	Yahoo's Revenue And Profit Rise	Yahoo Inc., the No. 1 Internet directory, said today that its third-quarter revenue more than doubled as both its audience and advertising sales rose. Yahoo reported net income of $14.9 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with $4.25 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Earnings a share, excluding costs from its acquisition of Broadcast.com, came to 14 cents a share, higher than the 9 cents a share forecast by analysts -- and even above the ''whisper number'' of 12 cents a share. Revenue rose to $155.1 million from $66.3 million a year earlier.
1999-10-05	Travelocity Makes a Deal To Dominate Web Market	Travelocity, the on-line travel service, said yesterday that it would acquire a smaller rival, Preview Travel, in a deal that will vault it past Microsoft's Expedia to be the largest travel site on the Web. Travelocity is part of the Sabre Group, the reservation system that is controlled by the AMR Corporation, American Airlines' parent. Because Preview Travel is a publicly traded company, the deal would allow Sabre to spin off Travelocity as a separate company without the expense of an initial public stock offering.
1999-09-25	YAHOO SITE IN CHINA	Yahoo Inc., the top Internet search service, said it would create an Internet directory site tailored for Web users in China, expanding its presence on the mainland even as the country moves to restrict foreign investment in its information technology. Under a joint venture with the Beijing Founder Electronics Company, a unit of Founder (Hong Kong) Ltd., the company will form Yahoo China, which will provide links to more than 20,000 Chinese-language Web sites and offer news, finance and technology information as well as E-mail and instant messaging.
1999-09-21	MORE FREE NET SERVICE IN ITALY	Wind S.p.A., the Italian mobile phone company that began operations in March, signed an accord with Yahoo Italia to provide free access to the Internet, matching offers made by its larger rivals, Telecom Italia and Tiscali. Phone companies are promoting Internet use in an attempt to capture a share of Italy's rapidly expanding Internet market. In 1998 there were only 640,000 Internet users in Italy, but the number is expected to rise to 1.55 million by the end of 1999 and to more than 3 million by the end of 2000. Wind is 51 percent-owned by Enel S.p.A., Italy's 100 percent state-owned electricity company, with the rest split between Deutsche Telekom A.G. and France Telecom S.A.
1999-08-24	Yahoo a Partner In New Web Site	Yahoo Inc. said today that it had teamed with Beatnik Inc., Emusic.com and Liquid Audio Inc. to start Yahoo Digital, a new music and video site on the Internet. Users of the new site, Yahoo said, will be able to watch and listen to music performances; preview, download and purchase music; remix music tracks on line and view on-demand video channels.
1999-08-23	Obsessively Independent, Yahoo Is the Web's Switzerland; Cutthroat Battles Are Ahead, Threatening a Stoic Resolve	For years, Timothy A. Koogle built high-performance cars and raced them. ''I just love speed,'' he says. ''And I love well-built, highly engineered machines.''
1999-07-24	In Cyberspace, Rivals Skirmish Over Messaging	America Online closed its on-line service yesterday to new software from two of its fiercest rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, that had been designed to tap into one of America Online's most popular features: instant messages. On Thursday, both the Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo introduced software that could send messages to some 40 million users of AOL Instant Messaging, a program that enables people to hold ''real time'' dialogues. Unlike standard E-mail, which arrives in a recipient's in-box to be read only when it is opened, instant-messaging software places a message in an open window on the recipient's computer screen seconds after it is transmitted.
1999-07-21	Yahoo Completes Deal	Yahoo Inc. said today that it had completed its of Broadcast.com Inc. for $5.05 billion in stock and options, adding audio and video programming. Yahoo will take a third-quarter charge of about $22 million for the acquisition. The company will exchange 0.7722 Yahoo share for each share of the Dallas-based Broadcast.com and will convert Broadcast.com options into 5.12 million Yahoo options.
1999-07-08	Yahoo Posts A 2d Quarter That Surpasses Expectations	Blasting away worries that the growth in Internet usage is slowing, Yahoo Inc. posted results yesterday for the second quarter that exceeded analysts' expectations. The company, which operates the most popular site on the World Wide Web, benefited from increases both in users and in advertising. Its gains were bolstered in part by its acquisition in May of Geocities, a popular service that lets people post their own home pages.
1999-07-01	Yahoo Changes Some Rules, Upsetting Some Geocities Users	In a move that has unleashed a grass-roots outcry, Yahoo has imposed new copyright rules on members of Geocities, a provider of free home pages that Yahoo bought in January for $3.6 billion. The new terms governing Geocities and its four million members were quietly introduced earlier this week as part of the recent merger of the two companies. News of the rule changes spread quickly among Geocities members. Dozens of members, upset over having to relinquish the copyright to their material, have opened Web sites in protest and encouraged members to move pages to other providers.
1999-07-01	P.& G. and Yahoo To Expand Links	The Procter & Gamble Company and Yahoo Inc. said yesterday that they would significantly expand their relationship as P.& G. seeks to intensify its advertising and marketing efforts on the Internet. Under the agreement, for undisclosed financial terms, Yahoo is putting up Web sites for P.& G. brands like Pampers (pampers.yahoo.com) and Pepto-Bismol (pepto.yahoo.com), as well as including P.& G. brands like Cascade, Dawn and Folgers in sampling programs like Welcome Home From Yahoo (realestate.yahoo.com). The deal gives P.& G. ''the potential to be one of our largest advertisers,'' said Jeff Mallett, president and chief operating officer at Yahoo in Santa Clara, Calif.
1999-06-28	Brazilians Take to the Web With Uncommon Speed	Pierre Schurmann, one of Brazil's Internet barons, did not know things would develop so fast. Three years ago, Mr. Schurmann, 30, founded Zeek, a popular search engine. Earlier this year, he sold Zeek to the Star Media Network, a company that was formed to seek out Internet opportunities in Latin America, and became director of new business development in Brazil. Then Star Media went public with a stock offering on Nasdaq.
1999-06-25	SOFTBANK VENTURES	Japan's Internet powerhouse, the Softbank Corporation, said it would set up two on-line businesses in toys and investment advice, along with three new venture capital funds that could invest up to $1.6 billion in start-ups in the country's fledgling Internet industry. Softbank is teaming with the Bandai Company, Yahoo Japan and five others to sell toys on line and will be joined by the Microsoft Corporation, Directadvice.com and other companies in offering financial advice to investors. Sheryl WuDunn (NYT)
1999-06-24	HEALTHEON AND ITS MERGER PARTNER MAKE INTERNET DEALS	The Healtheon Corporation said yesterday that it would provide health care information to Yahoo Inc. under an Internet content and marketing agreement. Terms were not disclosed. Meanwhile, Healtheon's merger partner, WebMD Inc., said it would develop a health Web site with Reader's Digest Association Inc. Healtheon is acquiring WebMD in a stock deal currently valued at more than $8 billion. The combined company already has marketing and distribution deals with such outlets as Microsoft's MSN and WebTV, At Home's Excite, Lycos Inc. and Time Warner's CNN. Reader's Digest, based in Pleasantville, N.Y., said it had invested $13 million in WebMD as part of the pact. Healtheon's stock was up $5.75, to $88.25.
1999-06-04	JAPANESE BOOK VENTURE	The Softbank Corporation has hooked up with the 7-Eleven Japan Corporation, which is 50 percent owned by the Ito-Yokado Company, and two other Japanese companies to create an Amazon.com-like Internet company to sell Japanese-language books. The venture, named E-Shopping Books, will start service in November with some 1.4 million Japanese titles. Softbank will own 50 percent, while 7-Eleven will own 30 percent. The Tohan Corporation, one of Japan's largest publishers, and the Yahoo Japan Corporation, an Internet directory service owned by Yahoo Inc., will own the rest. Stephanie Strom
1999-06-03	YAHOO IN ACQUISITION TO EXPAND USE OF ITS DIRECTORIES	Yahoo Inc. said yesterday that it had bought the closely held Online Anywhere, which formats Internet pages for hand-held devices, for $80 million in stock to move beyond Internet directories that are limited to personal computers. Yahoo said the acquisition would let it transmit its Internet directories to pagers, cell phones and hand-held computers such as 3Com Corporation's PalmPilot, as well as Web-TV services that allow simultaneous use of Internet features and television programs. It did not disclose details of the purchase. Shares of Yahoo, based in Santa Clara, Calif., rose $4.3125, to $142.50.
1999-06-03	In Spanish and Portuguese, Web Growth Spurt	IN January, Anna Spinello, a clothing designer in Buenos Aires, set up a Web site to help boost sales of her spring line. By clicking on a little flag, a viewer can see the site in English, Spanish or Portuguese. ''Considering we haven't publicized it, we've had an amazing response,'' said her son Francesco Spinello, 42, who manages the small, family-run business (www.annaspinello.com) that sells to boutiques in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. ''We've made a lot of contacts that should pay off with the next collection.''
1999-05-29	YAHOO CUTS WORK FORCE AND TAKES EARNINGS CHARGE	Yahoo Inc., the No. 1 Internet search service, said yesterday that it had dismissed about 200 employees of Geocities Inc., or 63 percent of its work force, and would take a $68 million pretax charge against second-quarter earnings for its $3.7 billion acquisition. Yahoo's president, Jeff Mallett, said about 100 Geocities employees would be retained at Yahoo, where they will be integrated into the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., and throughout its regional United States sales offices. Yahoo will close the Geocities headquarters in Marina del Rey, Calif. Yahoo aquired Geocities, the top provider of personal Web pages, to broaden its audience and market other services.
1999-05-28	YAHOO IS BUYING SOFTWARE DEVELOPER FOR $130 MILLION	Yahoo Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Encompass Inc., a developer of consumer Internet software, for $130 million. With the acquisition, Yahoo, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., can expand the services it offers its strategic partners through its Internet portal. Besides connecting consumers to the Internet, Encompass, based in Atlanta, provides product registration services that companies use to capture demographic information about customers.
1999-05-17	What This Has Been All About.com	It was a few days before Miningco.com was scheduled to go public in March. Scott Kurnit, the company's founder and chief executive, called its lawyer to ask whether there was any law that prevented a company, on the day it goes public, from changing its name. Not exactly, the lawyer said -- but if he was going to do that, Mr. Kurnit should alert Bear, Stearns, the investment bank managing the offering.
1999-04-26	Compressed Data; New Ratings Give Lycos A Reason to Celebrate	In the Internet business, the top of the heap is a very unsteady place. And nobody knows that better than Bob Davis, chief executive of Lycos Network Inc. Last week, Media Metrix, which measures Web traffic, announced that in March, the Lycos network of 11 sites, including the search service Lycos.com, surpassed Yahoo in audience reach for the first time. That means that more people visited a Lycos site in March than a Yahoo site -- 31.9 million people versus 31.3 million. Lycos, however, is still outranked by America Online and Microsoft sites.
1999-04-08	Yahoo's Earnings Performance Was Strong in the First Quarter	Yahoo Inc., whose Internet sites include a range of features from chat rooms to news and search services, said today that first-quarter earnings soared and revenue almost tripled, buoyed by growth in advertising and commissions from on-line sales. Shares of Yahoo surged as much as $8.5625, to $217, in after-hours trading. Before the results were announced, Yahoo closed down $6.4375 at $208.4375.
1999-04-06	Deal on Internet Content	Yahoo Inc. announced an agreement today with Online Anywhere, a unit of Motorola Inc. that provides Internet content to a range of personal computer, wireless and other hand-held devices. Terms were not disclosed. Online Anywhere, based in Santa Clara, enables Internet content to be distributed to televisions and portable computers in a format specific to those devices. The agreement includes such Yahooservices as E-mail, calendar, stock prices and weather.
1999-04-01	$5.6 Billion Deal by Yahoo Reported Set	Yahoo is expected to announce today that it has agreed to buy Broadcast.com in a stock swap valued at $5.6 billion, executives close to the talks said yesterday. The boards of both companies met yesterday and approved the deal, which had been rumored for some time, the executives said.
1999-03-22	TECHNOLOGY: E-Commerce Report; To cut costs of finding consumers on the Internet, on-line merchants pay other Web sites for customer referrals.	IF 1998 was the Year of the Portal in electronic commerce, 1999 may be the Year of the Affiliate, as Web merchants realize that one way to balance the books is to recruit other sites to help sell their goods. The partnerships range from deals between companies with established brands to arrangements that retailers make with individuals who have built personal home pages. Members of the Geocities personal Web community (www.geocities.com), for instance, can earn commissions on purchases that result when they refer visitors to Internet retailers that participate in Geocities' Pages That Pay program.
1999-03-18	Rising Tide: Sites Born of Hate	AT first glance, Nole's Page looks like any one of the thousands of personal home pages digitally dashed upon the Internet by adolescents with a modicum of computer skills and a hankering to be noticed. The page, which claims to be all about Santa Barbara, Calif., displays the name of the city, framed by American flags, above torches that burn with animated fire. Along the left side of the page are buttons directing viewers to some of Nole's favorite things, including ''the beer of champions.'' But visitors who scroll down, to the sound of rock power chords, soon discover that the Web site is actually devoted to ''white power.'' Nole's Page turns out to be a neo-Nazi rant peppered with glowing references to skinhead ideology. It also has 50 links to like-minded sites, from those selling Nazi memorabilia to tracts about breaking ''the chains of Jewish materialism.''
1999-03-16	YAHOO TO OFFER CREDIT CARD SERVICES THROUGH BANK ONE	Yahoo Inc., the No. 1 Internet directory, signed an agreement with the Bank One Corporation and the First Data Corporation to offer credit card processing services to on-line stores featured on Yahoo's Web site. Yahoo said it was working with Banc One Payment Services, a joint venture of First Data and Bank One. Terms were not disclosed. Yahoo began its store service last year, allowing retailers to design and set up Web sites that let people buy and sell goods on the Internet. The credit card service will help Yahoo merchants establish and process credit cards within 48 hours of setting up shop on the Web, instead of the usual wait of as long as six weeks. Yahoo rose $3.4375 a share, to $179.4375.
1999-02-18	Softbank Trims Its Yahoo Stake	The Softbank Corporation, Japan's top software distributor and a shareholder in dozens of Internet ventures, said today that it had sold a $410 million stake in Yahoo Inc. to finance new investments. Softbank's United States holding company sold three million shares in the world's most-visited Internet directory, reducing its stake to 28 percent from 30 percent and recording a capital gain of $390 million. The one-time gain will drag the company out of the red, tripling its group profit to 32 billion yen ($271 million).
1999-01-29	Inflated Stocks Cushion Pitfalls Of Net Mergers	A handful of leading companies will come to dominate cyberspace. That snippet of rhetoric has become all the analytical underpinning there is to justify the unprecedented stock market values of the prominent Internet companies like Yahoo, America Online and Amazon.com. On the face of it, that well could be true. On the other hand, the Internet may make it easier for new competitors to constantly challenge the leaders.
1999-01-28	Yahoo Said to Be Buying Geocities in Union of Top Sites	In a move meant to defend its position as the world's leading site on the Internet, Yahoo Inc. has agreed to buy Geocities, another popular site, financial executives briefed on the deal said last night. Late yesterday, Yahoo scheduled a conference call with analysts for today. But Diane Hunt, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to comment on the call's topic last night.
1999-01-13	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Rare for an Internet company, Yahoo reports actual earnings. Not that such things matter.	YAHOO INC., a bellwether Internet stock, released earnings yesterday confirming that it had surpassed Wall Street's financial expectations. But does it matter? The recent surge in share prices for Internet companies has analysts wondering whether financial performance is irrelevant for many of the small investors jumping in.
1998-12-22	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Network Solutions soars, despite the coming loss of its exclusive accord for Internet domain names.	IF all the Internet stocks out there right now, Network Solutions Inc. would seem at first blush to be least likely to be hot. Everyone knows, after all, that sometime next year this Herndon, Va., company will lose its exclusive Government contract for registering the popular Internet domains of .com, .net and .org -- the monopoly that accounts for virtually all its revenue. And yet, in the last two weeks, Network Solutions' shares have tripled, joining the A-list of Internet stocks already in the stratosphere. On Friday, it closed at $121, up from $59 two weeks earlier. And the ride continued yesterday, as its shares reached $164.72 by the close of Nasdaq trading.
1998-12-13	Mouse Attack In Cyberspace	A 19-YEAR-OLD college student sat alone with a computer as a commanding voice echoed through the windowless room. ''Now go to No. 5,'' the voice said. ''Find out what the weather is like in San Jose.''
1998-11-22	Flights of Fancy In Internet Stocks	IT was a sunny afternoon in Tucson last March when Mary Meeker sprinted past a cluster of computer executives chatting at PC Forum, an annual gathering of the digirati. Ms. Meeker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is best known for her coverage of Internet companies. ''Mary, would you sell Yahoo when it hits $5 billion?,'' a reporter shouted from the crowd. Yahoo, the top-rated site that guides people to destinations on the World Wide Web, had already become the darling stock of high-technology investors. Despite tiny sales and microscopic profits, it had surged to a total market value of $4 billion.
1998-11-19	For Air Crash Victims, Solace Comes on Line	After the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the airline brought grieving families to Halifax, Nova Scotia, booked them into hotels and bused them to the crash site -- the customary help. But then it gave them something unusual: space on the airline's Web page to speak with one another. Now, on a different bulletin board set up on Yahoo, the families are pouring out their souls about the crash. It is a new way of grieving that has also been used by families hurt by other crashes.
1998-11-16	Where Does Microsoft Want You To Go Today?; The New Strategy: Keep Web Surfers Busy With a Series Of MSN Sites	Haven't we seen this screen before? The latest Internet initiative from the Microsoft Corporation is an all-in-one service that combines news, information, shopping, bulletin boards and electronic mail. Even its name sounds familiar: MSN.
1998-09-25	AT&T-Yahoo Partnership	The AT&T Corporation has expanded its marketing partnership with Yahoo Inc., the No. 1 Internet search directory, to create a co-branded Internet service. AT&T had agreed with Yahoo in May to market its phone services on Yahoo's directory. The new service will be called Yahoo Online, powered by AT&T Worldnet Service. The Yahoo Online service will be available at an introductory subscription for $14.95 a month, the companies said.
1998-09-24	Sign of the Times (Square) -- PC's for Visitors	Raphael Kobi (left) and Mohamed Kone (right), two students from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, use a new Internet surfing station in the Times Square Visitors Center in Manhattan. The six computer terminals were installed by the Times Square Business Improvement District in conjunction with Yahoo, which designed a specific homepage for the machines (timessquare.yahoo.com). Mr. Kobi and Mr. Kone used them to send photographs of themselves to friends through E-mail.
1998-09-20	For Yahoo, the Growth Mantra Goes On and On and On	Investors searching for signs of life in the stock market, and for the technology sector in particular, need look no further than their Internet search engine. While thousands of stocks are trading at 25 percent or more below their recent highs, shares of Yahoo, which closed at $90.4375 on Friday, are up 430 percent from their one-year low and off just 12.8 percent from their high on July 7. There is more good news. On Thursday, at a conference sponsored by Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, Yahoo's management told portfolio managers that the company's operating profit margin was likely to increase by more than one-third by this time next year. That means that the 16 to 26 percent operating margins that Yahoo said it expected when it went public in mid-1996 should increase to a range of 30 to 36 percent.
1998-09-17	Happy Birthday, Your Team Won, Your Stock Crashed	WEEKDAY mornings for Jessica Nierenberg, a 23-year-old research manager at a market research company in San Francisco, usually begin with a dash to her neighborhood bus stop for a 30-minute ride to her office in the city's financial district downtown. By 8:30 she is at her desk, pouring herself a bowl of breakfast cereal and firing up her computer for a glimpse at what the planet has wrought while she slept. What greets her on her computer's screen is selected and displayed by My Yahoo, a free service by Yahoo, the giant Internet information company based in Santa Clara, Calif. My Yahoo shows Ms. Nierenberg how many E-mail messages she has waiting to be read and a sampling of news headlines -- she can decide to call up any of the articles on domestic, political and international news for a more detailed look. Weather forecasts for her area and for Boston, her hometown, are parked in a corner of the screen.
1998-09-10	Company Has a Problem With Net's John Doe(s)	The Itex Corporation, an investment firm in Portland, Ore., last week filed an anti-defamation lawsuit in an Oregon court. There is just one catch: Itex is not exactly sure whom it filed the suit against. The company filed the complaint in Multnomah County Circuit Court to enjoin certain individuals from writing defamatory statements against Itex on Yahoo message boards. Trouble is, the individuals who posted the messages are known only by their on-line handles, including Orangemuscat and Investor727.
1998-09-03	Desperately Seeking Susan OR Suzie NOT Sushi	IF the World Wide Web ever adopted a theme song, it could do worse than picking ''I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.'' Searching the Web is the most popular on-line activity -- and often the most frustrating. In June, more than half of the top 10 most-visited domains were Web search sites, according to an Internet metering service, Media Metrix. But how many of the people visiting those sites found what they were looking for right away? Not most, according to Karin Rex, whose Pennsylvania-based company Computer Ease conducts Internet search classes. ''Most people type in words and get a bazillion hits,'' Ms. Rex said. ''Some of the ones on the first page may pertain to what they're looking for, but most of them won't.''

1998-07-14	Canadian Ruling Unmasks a Company's Internet Critics	In a ruling that may impose new limits on some on-line discussions, a Canadian court has unmasked several pseudonymous critics that attacked an Ontario-based recycling company on an Internet message board. While the company, the Philip Services Corporation, has not yet sued for libel, it contends that it has been defamed by comments posted in a finance forum on Yahoo, a popular World Wide Web site. Last month, a court in Toronto ruled for the company, ordering 12 Internet service providers to turn over the names of subscribers who used aliases in expressing their often-vituperative opinions. At least one Internet service provider complied with the order last week.
1998-07-09	Yahoo Reports Strong Earnings For 2d Quarter	Yahoo Inc. reported second-quarter earnings yesterday that were sharply higher than analysts' expectations. The results and the announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split sent Yahoo's already stratospheric stock price surging even higher in after-hours trading. Yahoo runs the most popular sites on the World Wide Web, and unlike most Internet companies it has begun to earn a small operating profit. In the last month, its share price has increased by more than 70 percent, giving the tiny company a market value of nearly $9 billion.
1998-06-25	Prime Real Estate on the Web: Portals	IN the past, Internet insiders liked to use the phrase prime real estate to describe the places on line where people liked to congregate. The new catch term is portal, which is often invoked when talking about the on-line plans of companies like Netscape, Infoseek, Lycos, Yahoo and Microsoft. Each of them wants to be the entryway to the Net, the place where users pause and look around before deciding where else to go once they have logged on. The word emerged as Internet developers realized that cyberspace could have places equivalent to town squares, business districts or malls by providing places where people could turn first by force of habit.
1998-06-19	Disney Joins Rush to Build Web Gateways	The Walt Disney Company joined the nation's biggest media and technology companies yesterday with its own effort to control where people go in cyberspace. Disney announced a complex deal valued at about $900 million in which it will buy 43 percent of Infoseek, a service that helps guide users on the World Wide Web.
1998-05-11	Eye Catching: How New Media Are Racing to Become the Mass Media; The Search Services Want Your Eyes to Find No Reason to Wander	Seek and ye shall find? Of all the searches conducted on the World Wide Web in the last three years, perhaps the most bewildering has been the quest for a profitable business model. But now, a consensus is emerging that the long-elusive money may be found in the search itself. Or at least in building services around Web searching.
1998-04-27	The Hum of Search Engines Is Music to Netscape's Ears	The search is on for search engines. A number of companies -- including Netscape Communications and some big traditional media players -- are looking to build or buy their own Internet search services.
1998-04-09	Yahoo's First-Quarter Earnings Exceed Expectations of Analysts	Yahoo Inc., the Internet directory service, reported first-quarter earnings today that exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations. Yahoo said traffic on its World Wide Web pages had increased by nearly 50 percent since the fourth quarter of 1997. Yahoo has become one of the few profitable Internet companies by turning its well-known brand name and popular services into a lure for advertisers. From a simple directory born in a Stanford University dormitory room, Yahoo, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has branched out to offer electronic commerce, financial services and telecommunications.
1998-03-16	With Goto.com's Search Engine, the Highest Bidder Shall Be Ranked First	In the world of Internet search services, finding just the right business model is proving as elusive as finding an entirely relevant list of search results. But the effort can be seen on the Web sites of all the industry's most familiar names. Yahoo, the biggest of the dozens of sites devoted to navigating the Web, is looking more like a commercial on-line service every day, with ''channels'' that organize information into categories. Likewise, Excite and Lycos have also added chat rooms, electronic mail and a wide range of original content like news, financial services, shopping and local entertainment guides.
1998-02-01	Is Yahoo Flying High With a Bull's-Eye on Its Back?	EVER since the Internet launched Netscape Communications, a tiny start-up with a good idea, into the stock market stratosphere, investors have been searching lists of new public companies to find the next Netscape. But now that the browser company has fallen to $16, from its high of $72 a share, investors are also trying to identify the next Internet Icarus before it crashes. Closest to the sun these days may be Yahoo, the leading ''search engine'' for Internet users.
1997-10-20	Updates/Media and Technology; Infoseek Revises Its Internet Search Engine	By providing a natural leaping-off point for the World Wide Web, the so-called search engines -- Yahoo, Infoseek, Excite, Lycos and the like -- attract more people to the Web than any other category of sites. No wonder these companies are eager to establish brand-name identities in hopes of attracting a loyal audience they can sell to advertisers. Yahoo has been most successful so far in establishing an identity as a hip, if quirky, Web portal. And now the Infoseek Corporation, whose patented search-engine technology is highly acclaimed but whose stock price has languished, is rolling out a revamped Web site.
1997-10-07	GTE Sues Netscape and Yahoo Over Internet Yellow Pages Access	The GTE Corporation filed an antitrust suit yesterday accusing the five regional Bell telephone companies, as well as two Internet companies, Netscape Communications and Yahoo Inc., with conspiring to limit competition in the emerging market for on-line yellow pages. In the lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Washington, GTE contended that the Bell companies pooled their resources and paid handsomely for an exclusive contract to be carried on Netscape's popular home page on the World Wide Web, whose reference section is prepared by Yahoo. Before the exclusive deal, GTE and other suppliers of national on-line yellow pages had been among the choices on Netscape's reference section.
1997-07-30	Yahoo Plans $21 Million Charge To Exit Joint Venture With Visa	Yahoo Inc., the leading Internet search company, said today that it would take a pretax charge of $21.2 million against its second-quarter earnings, reflecting its decision to buy its way out of a joint venture with Visa International. Yahoo said it would restate its results for the quarter to show a net loss of $20.5 million rather than earnings of $610,000.
1997-07-28	On-Line Guide To Music Offered By MTV and Yahoo	MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom Inc., and Yahoo Inc. announced the introduction of their much anticipated World Wide Web music guide, Unfurled, this month. The music cable network and the Web directory service teamed up to create the new site, which will offer music fans a comprehensive directory linking users to music-related Web sites. Unfurled will also have daily music news, event listings and industry gossip. The site features a directory of more than 1,100 performers and bands that links users to sites about their favorite artists. Unfurled (http://www.unfurled.com) also features local entertainment listings and a directory for musicians with links to Web resources and information about equipment, instruments, and even studio space.

1997-03-13	U.P.S. IN TRACKING DEALS WITH INTERNET SEARCH COMPANIES	United Parcel Service of America Inc. has reached agreements with the Infoseek Corporation, Lycos Inc. and Yahoo Inc. to provide U.P.S. on-line utilities on the Web sites of the Internet service companies. U.P.S. said in a statement that beginning yesterday, users of Infoseek, Lycos and Yahoo would be able to track U.P.S. packages, find drop-off centers and download U.P.S. on-line tracking software from the search-engine companies' Web sites. U.P.S. said it expected to double its Internet tracking activity.
1996-10-01	An Internet newcomer is making money by selling moving ads as part of screen savers.	ADVERTISING in cyberspace has not been a lucrative venture for many. But one Internet company thinks it has hit upon a formula that could work. Pointcast Inc., a new company based in Cupertino, Calif., has begun what it calls ''Internet broadcasting,'' delivering customized news, weather forecasts, stock quotes, sports scores -- and yes, even advertising -- directly into computers using an Internet connection. After just three months on line, its site is already challenging the Netscape Communications Corporation and Yahoo Inc. as one of the biggest earners of advertising dollars on the Web.
1996-04-13	Yahoo Gets Big Welcome On Wall Street	Yahoo Inc., named to celebrate the rowdy culture of the Internet, found a warm welcome on staid Wall Street yesterday. Investors, undaunted by Yahoo's lack of profits and formidable array of competitors, gave the young company a first-day market valuation of nearly $1 billion. Underwriters, led by Goldman, Sachs & Company, set an offering price of $13 Thursday night on 2.6 million new shares, but the stock opened yesterday at $24.50 as demand outstripped supply. The shares rose quickly in very heavy trading to reach $43 before settling back to $33 at the end of the day.
1996-04-12	Yahoo! Offering Is Set for Today	Investors' infatuation with Internet stocks will be tested again today when Yahoo! Inc. makes its initial public offering at $13 a share. Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company priced the shares yesterday higher than their original expectations of $10 to $12 each in anticipation of very strong investor interest. Yahoo!, an on-line directory service, has one of the best-known brand names among users of the Internet.
1995-10-23	Most Go on Line at Home, Study Finds	A new survey conducted at one of the Internet's most popular hangouts suggests that most people are tapping into the World Wide Web and commercial on-line services from home, not from the office or at school. The survey of Internet users, conducted by Yahoo Inc. and Jupiter Communications Inc. for release today, concludes that computer networks are become a mass market medium much faster than many people expected.
