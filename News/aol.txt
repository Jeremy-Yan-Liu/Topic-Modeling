4/24/2012	Business Day Live | April 24, 2012	SEATTLE - A plan by Facebook to acquire a broad range of patents through a deal with Microsoft is on its surface yet another twist in the battles over intellectual property engulfing the tech business. But the subtext of the deal is a different story, showing how two of technology's most powerful players are teaming up to create a greater balance of power on the Internet - a market that has been tilted decisively in favor of one company, Google, for years. ''This is almost certainly a move against Google,'' said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at Altimeter Group, a research firm. The agreement between Microsoft and Facebook, announced on Monday, came less than two weeks after Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 925 patents held by AOL. In a second deal, Microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents - about 650 in all - to Facebook for $550 million in cash, along with rights to 275 AOL patents Microsoft plans to retain. While Facebook and Microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents, it is expected that Facebook will end up with a range of patents involving mobile, Web and instant messaging technologies. Microsoft is likely to keep AOL patents involving search, among other things. The arrangement will help Facebook bulk up its intellectual property portfolio before its ini tial public offering, which is expected next month, and it is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company. ''This is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests over the long term,'' Ted Ullyot, general counsel of Facebook, said in a statement. The deal could also give Facebook additional ammunition in its escalating patent feud with Yahoo. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming violations of Yahoo patents, many related to online advertising. Facebook subsequently countersued Yahoo, in a pattern that is playing out again and again in different parts of the technology business, especially the mobile phone market. But in large part the deal is evidence of how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated ever closer to each other in part because of a common enemy, Google. Google has menaced Microsoft's business on a number of fronts, including with free online Google applications that compete with Microsoft Office and with Android, a mobile operating system that competes with Microsoft's Windows Phone software. As Facebook has evolved into a Web behemoth, with 900 million active monthly users, Google has become increasingly focused on tamping down the challenge to its business from the social network, introducing Google Plus, a rival social service. Google's big concern is that the bounty of data Facebook has about its users, including their tastes and friend connections, will turn it into a serious rival for online advertising dollars. There is also wide speculation that Facebook will start its own Internet search engine to rival Google. ''Microsoft is simply less concerned about the threat of social to its business than Google is,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, explaining why Microsoft is not concerned about competition with Facebook. ''This may be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' he added. Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, declined to comment. Microsoft has spent the last several years forging deeper connections with Facebook at every turn. Long stymied in its efforts to create an Internet search engine that effectively competed against Google, Microsoft two years ago struck a deal with Facebook to use data from the social network in Microsoft's Bing search engine to create more relevant search results. But the arrangement has not helped dislodge Google from its position of supremacy in Internet search. Years before that, Microsoft tried to acquire Facebook, but the social network's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, rebuffed the offer. Those conversations subsequently led to Microsoft's taking a small stake in Facebook, from which it stands to profit handsomely after the company goes public. In March, Google accounted for 66.4 percent of Internet searches in the United States, unchanged from the same month a year earlier, while Microsoft was in second place with 15.3 percent of the market, according to comScore. Microsoft's Bing search engine also supplies search results for Yahoo, which accounted for 13.7 percent of the search market during March. Microsoft has continued to lose money on Bing, including more than $2.6 billion in operating losses for its online division during its last fiscal year. Some executives within Microsoft have advocated selling Bing to another company, with the idea that a company better focused on the Internet market could pose a more credible challenge to Google, according to severalpeople with knowledge of the discussions who didn't want to be identified talking about internal deliberations.Over a year ago, Microsoft executives sent out feelers to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in acquiring Bing, though the overture was not officially sanctioned by Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, one of these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg declined, saying Facebook had too much else to concentrate on. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook. In its original patent deal with AOL, Microsoft either bought or won the ability to assign about 925 patents and patent applications, along with a license to several hundred other patents AOL did not sell as part of an auction of its intellectual property. If the deal announced Monday clears regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft would still own about 275 AOL patents and retain a license to the 650 patents that Facebook will own. In addition, Microsoft is granting Facebook a license to the 275 AOL patents that it is keeping. Yahoo's legal attack on Facebook came at a sensitive time, as the company nears an expected initial public offering. In a statement, Yahoo said the deal with Microsoft will not deter its lawsuit against Facebook. ''Nothing about today's action changes the fact that Facebook continues to infringe our patents,'' Yahoo said in the statement. ''Companies who purchase patents are often working from a position of weakness and take these actions to strengthen their portfolio. We see today's announcement as a validation of our case against Facebook.'' The deal with Facebook puts Microsoft in an awkward position since it could help strengthen one close partner at the expense of another, Yahoo. ''We are very sensitive to the importance of our relationship with both Facebook and Yahoo,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel said in an interview. ''We have enormous respect for the value of the Yahoo patent portfolio. Yahoo has been an important innovator in the Internet space.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The man, Adam Vitale, 26, was charged with sending junk e-mail messages to 1.2 million subscribers in August 2005, said Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Garcia said that Mr. Vitale admitted hiding the origin of the mail by using other computers to relay and transmit the spam. He faces up to 11 years in prison when he is sentenced in September, prosecutors said.
6/8/2007	Back of the Envelope	Was last month the peak? The wave of buyouts continued to rise in May, making it the one of the biggest deal-making months ever. Only January 2000, when the America Online-Time Warner merger was announced, and April 1998 (the Citicorp-Travelers deal) were bigger..
4/18/2007	In Words and Silence, Hints of Anger and Isolation	Cho Seung-Hui rarely spoke to his own dormitory roommate. His teachers were so disturbed by some of his writing that they referred him to counseling. And when Mr. Cho finally and horrifyingly came to the world's attention on Monday, he did so after writing a note that bitterly lashed out at his fellow students for what he deemed their moral decay. Mr. Cho's eruption of violence, in which 32 victims and himself were killed on the Virginia Tech campus here in a rampage of gunfire, was never directly signaled by his actions or words, several of his acquaintances said Tuesday. But those acquaintances were frequently disturbed by his isolation from the world and his barely concealed anger.
1/16/2007	AOL Agrees to Buy Online Ad Broker for $900 Million	AOL said Monday that it had agreed to buy TradeDoubler, a Swedish company that matches Internet advertisers with online media owners and e-commerce sites, as AOL tries to grab a bigger share of the booming global market in Internet advertising. The deal, at 6.3 billion Swedish kronor, or $900 million, would be AOL's first major acquisition since Randy Falco was named chief executive in November, after the company's shift to a free, advertiser-supported portal from a subscriber-based service.

Yesterday the site, which is free and available to AOL subscribers and nonsubscribers alike, posted songs from the first four nights (the tour began on Sunday in Boston), and this Sunday it will offer a song from tomorrow's concert in Glendale, Ariz.

4/30/2006	AOL: A Punching Bag In Need of a Big Hit	TIME WARNER will announce its first-quarter results on Wednesday, the first since the Icahn Insurgency against the company fizzled. Aside from a renewed enthusiasm for cable television -- one of Time Warner's myriad businesses -- Wall Street is not expecting sudden miracles from the planet's biggest media conglomerate. And, yet again, there is one standout reason for the blasé view of the company: the prospects for America Online, officially rechristened earlier this month as the zippier-sounding AOL. Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch, lowered her estimates for revenue and earnings at Time Warner ''largely due to anticipated weakness at AOL.'' Anthony J. Noto of Goldman Sachs forecast only a modest single-digit long-term growth rate for the company unless it can return AOL to ''meaningful'' growth in revenue and operating earnings -- a prospect, he made clear, ''we do not believe will happen in the foreseeable future.''
4/13/2006	Reality Shows and Comedies And the 'Network' Is AOL	FOR the chief executive of AOL, Jonathan F. Miller, the gold rush of 2006 is a reality show featuring an interactive treasure hunt to be shown on AOL.com. In the show, to be called ''Gold Rush,'' clues are scattered throughout the pages of the Web site, hinting where real gold is stashed throughout America.
2/28/2006	Plan for Fees on Some E-Mail Spurs Protest	A group of nonprofit and public interest groups is beginning a campaign today to protest plans by America Online and Yahoo, which each offer e-mail services, to charge high-volume senders of e-mail fees to guarantee preferred delivery of their messages. AOL and Yahoo are working with Goodmail, a Silicon Valley company, which plans to charge between a quarter-cent and a cent for each message. The two Internet companies will get the bulk of the fees that Goodmail collects.
2/21/2006	With a Few Clicks, You, Too, Can Start to Change Your Life	Television has historically defined itself against work. The sedentary television rules the living room in view of a fat sofa -- those great monuments of domestic leisure. The evening news marks the end of the workday; prime time exists as an alternative to plays and movies; and those lucky enough to be sick or jobless get to watch talk shows and soaps. Watching television is so much the opposite of work, in fact, that it's hardly even a purposeful act: If you spend Saturday and Sunday watching television, you can credibly say you spent the weekend doing nothing at all.
2/18/2006	Time Warner and Icahn Reach a Settlement	The sudden end of the assault by Carl C. Icahn on Time Warner yesterday came after a last-ditch effort by Mr. Icahn late Thursday night to gain representation on Time Warner's board. In an 11:30 p.m. phone call to Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner -- with whom he had met secretly in deal talks earlier that day -- Mr. Icahn said one of his investment partners was now insisting their group be allowed to appoint two directors.
2/18/2006	A Week to Make Wall St. and Shoppers Happy	WHILE Vice President Dick Cheney's hunting accident dominated public discourse this week, many people still found time to buy and sell everything from toasters to the generating stations needed to power them. WIN-WIN-WOW -- Merrill Lynch transformed its underperforming asset management business into a crown jewel by shipping it to BlackRock, a firm that specializes in asset management, in exchange for 49.8 percent of the combined company.
2/16/2006	Icahn Expected to Step Up Time Warner Campaign	Carl C. Icahn will try to escalate his fight to break up Time Warner today by proposing a slate of directors that includes Dale M. Hanson, the former chief executive of a powerful pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, according to people involved in the plan. Mr. Icahn is expected to name a handful of other executives and corporate governance experts as candidates for the board, possibly including a former commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, these people said. It was unclear last night whether Mr. Icahn would propose a full slate of 14 directors.
2/12/2006	Sending E-Mail? Pay the Toll	To the Editor: You report that AOL and Yahoo are planning to issue the equivalent of electronic stamps so that corporations and institutions may create priority e-mail that is differentiated from spam. It is an excellent idea. But the rest of us who are inundated with electronic trash can use the same protection.
2/12/2006	Sending E-Mail? Pay the Toll	To the Editor: As the director of a nonprofit built on the power of the Internet and free e-mailing, I am outraged by the idea of a fee for sending e-mail. This contradicts the premise of the Internet and will not only hamper communications, but also give preferential treatment to those who can afford such fees, notably large corporations. Our organization has been overwhelmed by the avalanche of spam mail, and is well aware of the huge problem this represents. Messages we send are also increasingly being caught in spam filters, making it difficult or impossible to reach our members, whether to confirm the receipt of applications, sending of funds or other business matters.
2/12/2006	Sending E-Mail? Pay the Toll	To the Editor: Re ''Postage Due, With Special Delivery, for Companies Sending E-Mail to AOL and Yahoo'' (news article, Feb. 5): I believe that many more like me would be more than happy to pay a few cents more per day for a service that verifies the identity of an e-mail sender, and reduces the spam coming into my mailbox. If someone can't afford to pay a quarter of a cent, then his message can't be worth my time either.
2/5/2006	Postage Due, With Special Delivery, for Companies Sending E-Mail to AOL and Yahoo	Companies will soon have to buy the electronic equivalent of a postage stamp if they want to be certain that their e-mail will be delivered to many of their customers. America Online and Yahoo, two of the world's largest providers of e-mail accounts, are about to start using a system that gives preferential treatment to messages from companies that pay from 1/4 of a cent to a penny each to have them delivered. The senders must promise to contact only people who have agreed to receive their messages, or risk being blocked entirely.
2/4/2006	Online Trail Can Lead To Court	Who is sending threatening e-mail to a teenager? Who is saying disparaging things about a company on an Internet message board? Who is communicating online with a suspected drug dealer? These questions, and many more like them, are asked every day of the companies that provide Internet service and run Web sites. And even though these companies promise to protect the privacy of their users, they routinely hand over the most intimate information in response to legal demands from criminal investigators and lawyers fighting civil cases.
12/20/2005	AOL Coaxes Google to Try Busier Ads	Users of Google's search engine will soon see something they are not used to on the notoriously spare site: advertising with logos and graphics. And the advertisers will not be limited to America Online, whose talks with Google prompted the change in policy, according to two executives close to the companies' negotiations. As part of their deal, which is expected to be formally announced this afternoon, Google is providing AOL with $300 million worth of advertising on Google's Web sites, intended to use to draw Google search users to related content on AOL's sites, the executives said. That sum is on top of the $1 billion in cash that Google is to invest to buy a 5 percent stake in AOL.
12/19/2005	The Advertising Column; AOL Choice Of Google Leaves Gates The Outsider	This time, it was Microsoft that was snubbed at the last minute. In 1996, America Online agreed to offer Netscape's Internet browser to its five million customers. A day later, the nonbinding agreement was shunted aside when AOL announced that it had instead chosen Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser in a $100 million deal.
8/29/2005	New Era of Ticket Resales: Online and Aboveboard	THOUGH they have claimed the mantle of respectability ever since they jumped online in the late 1990's, ticket scalpers have not been able to shake their reputation as hustlers out to make a quick buck on sold-out shows. But with America Online, the tamest player on the Wild Wild Web, joining them, can legitimacy be far behind? Last week, AOL opened its Ticket Marketplace service on its City Guide pages, offering everything from a front-row seat to the Paul McCartney concert at Madison Square Garden in September for $3,420, to a nosebleed view of the Rolling Stones at Comerica Park in Detroit on Wednesday for $56.
8/29/2005	Canceling AOL? Just Offer Your Firstborn	THREE years ago my brother died (officially missing, presumed dead -- no death certificate),'' wrote an anonymous contributor last week at gripe2ed.com, a consumer complaint Web log. ''At that time I was able to cancel his credit card, gas, insurance -- everything except his AOL account.'' It seems that America Online, not entirely irrationally, needed a screen name and other account information to properly cancel the subscription -- something this consumer, under the circumstances, did not have handy. Collection notices for payments past due soon followed. The consumer was not amused.
8/15/2005	Even in Vain, Swatting Spammers Feels Good	IT seemed a banner week for the antispam crusade. Last Tuesday, Microsoft announced that Scott Richter, whose company in Colorado, OptInRealBig.com, was considered by antispam activists to be one of the world's most prolific junk e-mail operations, had agreed to settle a lawsuit with the company for $7 million.
2/14/2005	Disney Book Is Good News For Publishers	James B. Stewart first approached Michael D. Eisner in 2001 about writing a book about the Walt Disney Company, but was turned away. Two years later Mr. Stewart, a Pulitzer-prize winning author, came calling again. And this time, after a dinner in New York, Mr. Eisner did not say no, noting that Disney was on the upswing and he personally had nothing to hide. ''There's no point in doing something if it's not fun,'' Mr. Stewart wrote in ''DisneyWar: The Battle for the Magic Kingdom,'' recalling what Mr. Eisner told him as he dropped him near his apartment. ''So let's have fun with this book.''
2/5/2005	Profit Report Is Solid, but Time Warner's Shares Dip on Concern About Bid for Adelphia	Despite a solid earnings report and a rising stock market, shares of Time Warner fell 12 cents, to close at $18.04 yesterday. Several analysts and investors attributed the decline to concerns that the Time Warner bid for Adelphia Communications would commit it further to an industry where growth could be slowing. The company said yesterday that its revenue for the fourth quarter rose 1.8 percent, to $11.1 billion, and that net income jumped 77 percent, to $1.1 billion, or 24 cents a share, compared with $639 million, or 14 cents a share, for the similar quarter in 2003.
2/1/2005	Long After Merger, AOL and Time Warner Cable Join Forces	Among all the elusive synergies promised by America Online's 2001 merger with Time Warner was one seemingly concrete benefit: AOL could help run the high-speed Internet service offered by Time Warner's cable division. Yet only yesterday did Time Warner's cable division and AOL, its Internet division, agree to do just that.
2/1/2005	Law Barring Junk E-Mail Allows a Flood Instead	A year after a sweeping federal antispam law went into effect, there is more junk e-mail on the Internet than ever, and Levon Gillespie, according to Microsoft, is one reason. Lawyers for the company seemed well on the way to shutting down Mr. Gillespie last September after he agreed to meet them at a Starbucks in Los Angeles near the University of Southern California. There they served him a court summons and a lawsuit accusing him, his Web site and 50 unnamed customers of violating state and federal law -- including the year-old federal Can Spam Act -- by flooding Microsoft's internal and customer e-mail networks with illegal spam, among other charges.
1/31/2005	Market Place; Adelphia Board's Choices Complicate a Bidding Process	As bids for Adelphia's cable systems come due today, a joint bid from Time Warner and Comcast remains the one to beat. But investors and analysts are warning that Time Warner and Comcast could be overpaying at the $17.5 billion asking price. And Adelphia is weighing other options, including selling pieces to financial buyers or simply keeping its assets and emerging from bankruptcy proceedings.
1/26/2005	Married To the Mall	THE upscale food court in the Time Warner Center can be derided for many reasons, but a lack of clear marking is not among them. From the moment you walk into the center, no matter which entrance you use, you encounter signs pointing the way to the preciously termed ''restaurant and bar collection'' a few stories up. But during a lunchtime visit to one of the restaurants last fall I encountered a well-dressed gentleman, perhaps in his early 60's, who paced before the elevators on the ground level. In a confused voice he asked me the location of the restaurant Per Se, where he had a coveted reservation.
1/12/2005	Book Club Takes Steps To Get Out Of Trouble	The Book-of-the-Month Club, a publishing tastemaker for generations of Americans that has seen its membership plunge in recent years, has begun an overhaul that includes the elimination of the panel of literary judges that each month choose the club's prestigious main selection. The popularity of Internet booksellers and the ubiquity of heavily discounted hardcover books at warehouse clubs and mass-market retailers have combined to make the Book-of-the-Month Club -- and other general-interest book clubs -- far less important in the selling of books in the United States. Though they are still very popular in Europe, the only American book clubs that have shown much growth in recent years are specialized clubs with niche subjects like history or medicine or ones that focus on groups like gay readers or African-Americans.
12/30/2004	Streamlined Cable TV In a Card	WHAT if I told you about a new product that could improve your TV picture, eliminate one of your remote controls, simplify your home-theater setup and save you money every month? And then what if I told you that your local distributor wished, in its heart of hearts, that nobody even knew about it?
12/26/2004	Inside the Year's Best-Reviewed Buildings	Architecturally noteworthy buildings tend to be written about -- celebrated or vilified -- before anyone actually inhabits them. So Arts & Leisure decided to follow up on three of the most prominent building projects completed in 2004 to see whether they have delivered on their artistic promise in practical terms for the people now working inside. Were the clients' needs met? Do the architects' head-turning flourishes hinder or further day-to-day business? What are the unforeseen miscalculations and the fortuitous benefits? ROBIN POGREBIN SEATTLE CENTRAL LIBRARY If Rem Koolhaas has become the ''it'' architect of the moment, it is in part because of his design for Seattle's main library, which opened in May. The former New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp called the project ''the most exciting new building it has been my honor to review'' in more than 30 years of writing about architecture.
12/16/2004	Time Warner Settles 2 Cases Over AOL Unit	The Justice Department announced yesterday that it would defer bringing criminal securities fraud charges against the America Online unit of Time Warner as long as Time Warner adopted corrective measures and allowed an independent monitor to oversee AOL's financial operations for two years. Separately, Time Warner announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges of accounting irregularities at AOL. The S.E.C.'s five commissioners still must consider the proposed settlement from the enforcement division.
12/15/2004	Settlements Seen In U.S. Inquiries Into Time Warner	Time Warner is expected to announce a settlement with the Justice Department in its investigation of advertising deals between America Online and smaller Internet companies that may have allowed America Online to exaggerate its growth, an official close to the case said yesterday. The announcement could come as early as today. The company may also announce a tentative agreement with the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is conducting a separate investigation into accounting irregularities at America Online, the official said. Time Warner is expected to pay $500 million to $600 million to settle all civil and criminal accusations with the two agencies.

12/2/2004	Head to Head; Television From a Distance: Comparing Two Approaches in the Field	SO how do Ken Schaffer's TV2Me and the Sony LocationFree TV compare? To find out, the two products were installed at separate homes in the New York area. Both locations are served by Time Warner Cable, with identical cable-modem services and set-top boxes. Equipment The TV2Me is simply a cubelike PC with no monitor, keyboard or mouse; think of it as a sort of auxiliary cable box. The LocationFree TV is two units: a base station the size of a large paperback book and a liquid-crystal display panel (in this test, a 12-inch version). Setup The two units were similarly easy to set up. To get started, one had only to run standard video and audio cords from the set-top box to the back of the unit. (The cable boxes conveniently had spare outputs; with only one output, a splitter cable would have been required.) Then each unit needed to be connected to the home broadband router with a standard Ethernet cable. Each controls the cable box with an IR Blaster, a small infrared emitter, which should sit a few inches in front of the set-top box. The only slight complication came in configuring the home routers to provide access from a remote location. (You could avoid using a router by plugging directly into a cable or D.S.L. modem, but then no other computer could use the connection.) About five minutes of fiddling with the router settings was needed, but documentation was adequate. Home Viewing In its home mode, relaying a picture wirelessly from the base station to the screen elsewhere in the home, the Sony provided a beautiful picture that looked identical to that of an ordinary L.C.D. television. If the home network includes a Wi-Fi base station, TV2Me can also be used in a wireless home mode -- with the picture viewed on a Wi-Fi-equipped laptop computer. But because TV2Me is meant mainly for remote use, its picture quality in home mode is nowhere close to Sony's. Remote Viewing The real test came when the two units were set up to provide viewing from remote locations -- a wireless Internet cafe and another residence. For both products, the limiting factor in determining picture quality is the bandwidth from the home location where the base units are installed. Initially, each home's cable-modem connections were generally providing about 250 kilobits of upstream bandwidth -- that is, the rate at which data is transmitted rather than received. Viewed remotely over an Internet connection -- on a laptop PC with Internet Explorer (for TV2Me) or on the L.C.D. tablet (for LocationFree TV) -- neither product provided fantastic picture quality at that transmission rate, but the TV2Me's images were clearer. Nor did either demonstrate much stuttering or the dreaded slide-show effect, but the resolution on the TV2Me connection was a clear step above that on the Sony. After the initial test, Time Warner increased the upstream bandwidth on both connections to 512 kilobits as part of what the company calls its Road Runner Premium package. The images on both units improved, but TV2Me still delivered a more detailed picture. SETH SCHIESEL
11/29/2004	On the Circle, A Tower Of Light And Colors	New Yorkers who do not like the color of the new environmental sculpture at the Time Warner Center have only to wait three minutes. It will change. And change again. Known as the ''Prow Sculpture,'' this glowing nighttime exclamation point over Columbus Circle was installed by Time Warner as part of its headquarters. Set in a 150-foot prowlike glass showcase on 58th Street, the sculpture is divided vertically into 12 groups of 36 lighting panels, looking something like a giant keyboard set on end -- if keyboards came in red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple.
11/28/2004	Total Television	CBS won the official ratings race during the first full week of the November sweeps, averaging 15 million viewers per prime-time hour, followed by NBC (11.3), ABC (10.4), Fox (7.3), WB (3.8) and UPN (3.7). But what about the 45 million or so other people, on average, who were watching television? Here's another way of looking at the ratings for that week: instead of ranking the broadcast networks, we've ranked the media conglomerates that own them -- and nearly every other outlet on your TiVo grid. The easy winner, predictably, was Viacom, owner of CBS and UPN as well as the MTV cable networks. But other high finishers, like Time Warner and Liberty Media, may be names that television viewers don't normally think of while cruising channels. (For each company, we added up the average viewers for all of the networks and cable channels in which it has a controlling interest; joint ventures were divided evenly among the owners. Only networks whose numbers are made public by Nielsen Media Research, and which met the company's minimum reporting standards, were included.) MIKE HALE Channels included for each company (in order of viewers, highest to lowest): Viacom: CBS, UPN, Nickelodeon, the N, Spike, MTV, Comedy Central, TV Land, BET, VH1, CMT, Noggin, Showtime, Nicktoons, the Movie Channel, MTV2. Walt Disney Company: ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel, Lifetime,* A&E,* History,* ABC Family, ESPN2, Lifetime Movie,* SoapNet, Toon Disney, Biography* (*joint ventures with General Electric and Hearst). General Electric: NBC, USA, Lifetime, A&E, Sci-Fi, History, Pax, Bravo, Lifetime Movie, MSNBC, CNBC, Biography.

11/24/2004	S.E.C. May Be Near Settlement With AOL	Time Warner is close to settling a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into accounting at America Online, a person close to the negotiations said yesterday. The development could give the company far more flexibility in its efforts to buy Adelphia Communications or make other acquisitions. The S.E.C. and the Justice Department are investigating a $400 million payment that America Online received from Bertelsmann, the German media company, which formerly owned half of AOL Europe. The agencies are looking into whether the payment was used improperly to inflate the growth of AOL.
11/22/2004	Free or Paid? AOL Will Let Its Two Halves Duke It Out; In a Risky Reversal, An Effort to Cash In On an Online Ad Boom	A year ago, America Online canceled a deal with Sportsline.com to introduce its own sports site with original columnists, a daily video program of sports highlights and a national call-in show on AOL's online radio service. It was all part of the company's broad effort to rebuild its vast online service in hopes of slowing the steady decline of subscribers. The problem was that AOL subscribers did not seem to care.
11/15/2004	MediaTalk; Simmons Searching For a New Music Gig	After watching the record business from the sidelines for a stretch, Russell Simmons has an idea of what's missing in rap music: him. Mr. Simmons, who co-founded the pioneering Def Jam record label, has been shopping for a deal to create a new label in a partnership with one of the major record corporations. Mr. Simmons lately has discussed the idea with executives at Warner Music Group, the former Time Warner Inc. unit that was sold to private investors this year.
11/15/2004	A High-Wire Act at Warner Bros.	With the release of ''Polar Express'' last week, Warner Bros. got off to a disappointing start in its high-risk sprint to the end of the year. At a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, it is opening five major films backed by pricey marketing campaigns. Some of the upcoming films, which include Oliver Stone's nearly three-hour epic ''Alexander'' and Steven Soderbergh's star-studded caper ''Ocean's Twelve,'' may well find broad audiences.
11/10/2004	COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET: Manhattan; Too Many Cooks, Too Few Affordable Spaces	WHEN Hakan Swahn, the owner of Aquavit, began looking for a new home for his renowned restaurant two years ago, he was determined to find space that was within a five-minute walk of its longstanding home at 13 West 54th Street. In just a few weeks, Mr. Swahn had four attractive offers, and next month Aquavit is scheduled to reopen at a larger, sleeker and better-laid-out site at 65 East 55th Street. The restaurant's current location has little street exposure and insufficient kitchen space. It is moving to the ground floor of a modern office tower, with an enviably long storefront, a larger bar and a private dining room. Mr. Swahn, meanwhile, will pay about 30 percent less in rent.
11/4/2004	Time Warner Reserves Funds For AOL Penalty	Time Warner said yesterday that it had set aside $500 million to pay for potential penalties stemming from a government investigation into accounting practices at America Online, a step that led to a 7.8 percent decline in profits in the third quarter. The company is awaiting a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department on the way it characterized a $400 million payment that AOL received from Bertelsmann, the German media company, which formerly owned half of AOL Europe. The regulators are looking into whether the payment was used improperly as part of an effort to inflate the growth of AOL.
11/3/2004	AOL Is Said to Plan 700 Layoffs	America Online, the country's leading Internet service, is preparing to lay off as many as 700 of its 13,000 employees in the United States, according to an executive knowledgeable about its plans. AOL, a unit of Time Warner, is continuing to cope with a declining subscriber base and an advertising business that, while rebounding, trails industry leaders like Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN. The layoffs will not be concentrated among any particular department, the executive said, and the exact jobs to be eliminated have not yet been determined. Time Warner is scheduled to report its earnings for the third quarter today and is expected to identify a reorganization charge related to severance and other costs from the planned layoffs, which were first reported by The Washington Post.
10/31/2004	Time Warner Said No Deal And Then Tried to Deal	LAST month, Richard D. Parsons, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive, appeared to accept defeat graciously after losing the battle for control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to a Sony-led consortium of investors. He even issued a statement saying that he had withdrawn Time Warner's bid because he could not reach a deal with MGM ''at a price that would have represented a prudent use of our growing financial capacity'' and that the company approaches ''every potential acquisition with strict financial discipline.'' The real story behind Mr. Parsons' retreat, however, appears to be slightly more complicated, to put it mildly. In fact, it was hardly a retreat at all.
10/27/2004	Europe and 6 Movie Studios Settle Antitrust Investigation	Six Hollywood movie studios have settled a two-year-old antitrust inquiry by the European Commission, agreeing to drop a requirement that forced European pay TV companies to offer the same terms to all the studios. Two other studios, however, Paramount and Universal, remain under investigation as they have so far failed to make changes in their contracts, Mario Monti, Europe's competition commissioner, said in the announcement on Tuesday.
10/6/2004	America Online's new campaign is designed to point consumers in several new directions.	AMERICA Online will begin a new ad campaign tomorrow with a new logo and a refocused brand promise, posed as a question to consumers: ''Want a better Internet?'' Executives hope that the answer -- which company research says is ''yes'' -- will prod consumers to take a fresh look at AOL.
9/30/2004	Equity Investors Buy Stake In a Big Hollywood Agency	One of Hollywood's leading talent management companies, the Firm, has sold a minority stake to two private equity investors, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital, the companies said Wednesday. The sale, for an undisclosed amount that one executive described as ''in the low eight figures,'' is intended to finance the Firm's day-to-day operations and possible acquisitions of other companies, executives at the Firm said.
9/28/2004	Time Warner And Comcast Discuss Bid For Adelphia	The Comcast Corporation, the cable giant, said yesterday that it was in talks with Time Warner Inc. to make a joint bid for Adelphia Communications, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection. The move by the nation's two largest cable operators was not unexpected, because the two companies are among the most financially capable of buying Adelphia, which is said to be seeking $18 billion to $19 billion for its national network, which serves 5.4 million subscribers.
9/20/2004	MediaTalk; Vivendi's Music Unit Climbs the Pop Chart With 2 Nelly Albums	Doug Morris, the chairman of Vivendi's Universal Music Group, is tuning up for a big week. On Wednesday, two albums just released by the Universal rapper Nelly, ''Sweat'' and ''Suit,'' are expected to capture the top two positions on the nation's pop chart, with combined first-week sales of about 800,000 copies. It would be the first time anyone has claimed the top two spots at once since Guns N' Roses did it in 1991 and the first time the feat has been managed by a black artist. But that's not all. Mr. Morris may also edge closer this week toward signing a five-year contract to continue running Universal, the world's largest music conglomerate and home to stars like U2 and Dr. Dre.
9/9/2004	BBC Is Exploring Options For Its Commercial Unit	Britain's public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation, said on Wednesday that it had been in touch with the American media giants Time Warner and Walt Disney, as well as other companies including Germany's Bertelsman, to discuss options for its BBC Worldwide commercial subsidiary. In a statement, the BBC insisted that ''it is wrong to say that these companies had been invited to bid for BBC Worldwide.'' The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the BBC had asked the companies to discuss ''possible bids'' for BBC Worldwide. The unit could be worth up to ?2 billion, or about $3.6 billion, the newspaper said, citing unidentified BBC executives.
9/8/2004	Ground Zero, The Long View; A Time-Lapse Look At a Nation's Scar	In the fall of 2001 when the dust and ash from the World Trade Center were still in the air, Jim Whitaker, a documentary filmmaker, decided to photograph everything happening at ground zero. By the spring of 2002 three cameras were pointed at the pit, each taking one shot every five minutes, round the clock. Months later, three more cameras were added. That was the beginning of Project Rebirth, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating a historical record of the rebuilding.
9/2/2004	MGM Said to Be Considering 2 Buyout Bids Below Early Estimate	Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is considering accepting a buyout offer well below the $5 billion price tag originally estimated when word first surfaced about a possible sale, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday. MGM, the Hollywood studio famous for ''The Wizard of Oz,'' James Bond and the Pink Panther, is considering whether to take an offer worth about $4.5 billion in cash from Time Warner or one worth about $4.8 billion in cash from Sony. Both offers value MGM's shares below their current price of $12.10.
9/2/2004	Conservatives Cry Foul in Publishing Scrum	These should be heady days for conservative authors. ''Unfit for Command,'' an unflattering appraisal of Senator John Kerry's service in Vietnam, is the fastest-selling book in the country. Ronald Kessler's sympathetic behind-the-scenes account of the Bush White House, ''A Matter of Character,'' also graces the national best-seller lists. Sean Hannity, Michael Savage and Dick Morris, conservatives all, have produced some of this year's most popular books. Big publishing houses are practically falling over themselves to bring new conservative titles to market. President Bush is moving up in the polls, and the Republicans have at least an even chance of holding on to control of the House and the Senate come November.
8/23/2004	E-Commerce Report; Advertisers discover the value of young men with time and money to spend on fantasy sports on the Web.	ADVERTISERS have uncovered a world of young men with plenty of time on their hands and money to spend -- a highly coveted demographic -- in an unlikely place. The young men are on the Internet, paying money to play fantasy sports games. Who knew? Fantasy baseball, football, basketball and hockey leagues, like the ones that are offered on Sportsline.com were among the first services to prove that consumers were willing to pay for online content. But now, free or low-cost services from AOL, NFL.com and even Best Buy are attracting advertising dollars and, potentially, driving down the price of content for everyone.
7/13/2004	Front Row	Designer Says He Is Staying at Perry Ellis Patrick Robinson brushed aside reports last week that he is about to abandon his post as the designer for Perry Ellis International. Mr. Robinson, said to be at odds with the Public Clothing Company, which manufactures the line, seems confident of smoothing over the reported rift. Reached by telephone on Friday, he said, ''I am in negotiations with Perry Ellis and feel very positive that things are going in the right direction.''
6/25/2004	AOL to Buy Advertising.com, an Online Direct Marketer	America Online agreed yesterday to pay $435 million in cash for Advertising.com, a company that specializes in online direct marketing for mortgage companies, correspondence courses and the like. AOL said the acquisition would help it expand in online advertising, an area that is growing rapidly even as AOL's traditional dial-up Internet service shrinks.
6/24/2004	AOL Worker Is Accused Of E-Mail Theft	An engineer working for America Online was arrested yesterday and charged with stealing 92 million e-mail addresses of AOL customers and selling them to spammers that were peddling penis enlargement pills and online gambling sites. The engineer, Jason Smathers, 24, was arrested at his home in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., yesterday. Sean Dunaway, 21, who was described by prosecutors as a broker of e-mail lists for spam, was arrested in Las Vegas. The United States attorney in Manhattan charged them both with violating the new federal antispam law.
6/23/2004	4 Rivals Near Agreement on Ways to Fight Spam	Four large Internet service providers agreed yesterday to a partial truce in their battle with one another over potential technology to stop junk e-mail in hopes that they can devote their united energy to fighting spam. More than a year ago the four providers -- America Online, Yahoo, EarthLink and Microsoft -- said that they would work together to create technical standards that could verify the identity of the sender of an e-mail message.
5/3/2004	AOL Expands Role in Saving For College	America Online is expanding its partnership with Upromise, a service that allows its members to save for their children's college tuition with automatic rebates from participating grocery stores, gas stations and other retailers. AOL, a unit of Time Warner, announced last week that it would begin a $30 million advertising campaign on Monday to promote the need to save for college and the benefits of joining Upromise. It said the move was intended to secure a stronger relationship with its subscribers.
3/24/2004	Online Swindlers, Called 'Phishers,' Lure the Unwary	Last year, EarthLink, the big Internet access provider, went hunting for phishers. It started a campaign to track down people who were sending e-mail messages that pretended to be from EarthLink but were actually fraudulent attempts to steal customers' passwords, credit card numbers and other information. What it found was that of the dozen or so people it could clearly identify as engaged in the practice known as phishing, more than half were under 18.
3/22/2004	E-Commerce Report; Proponents say that the time has come for online radio, and now they hope mainstream advertisers come along.	THE static that has enveloped the Internet radio industry is starting to clear. The protracted legal and regulatory battles involving so-called Webcasters, the recording industry and the federal copyright authorities have dissipated, while the number of consumers who listen to the radio over their computers has risen to the point where the medium should -- according to its proponents, at least -- begin to gain respect from mainstream advertisers.
3/11/2004	4 Big Internet Providers File Suits To Stop Leading Senders of Spam	Four major Internet providers announced yesterday that they had filed lawsuits meant to shut a number of leading senders of unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam. The suits, which are seeking monetary damages and injunctions against further mass e-mail messages, are among the first to invoke the new federal antispam law, which went into effect Jan. 1.
2/18/2004	The Spies in Your Computer	The Internet service provider America Online touched on a serious problem when it announced plans to provide its customers with software that detects and disables ''spyware'' -- covert programs that can secretly record a user's movements through the Internet for use by marketers and identity thieves. The screening programs, which are already available from at least one other Internet provider, Earthlink, are an important tool in the campaign to protect users from intrusive marketers and information thieves. Finishing the job will require action from Congress, which is just waking up to the spyware problem. Congress recently passed a law aimed at stemming the rising tide of electronic junk mail. But that law will do nothing about the covert programs -- variously known as adware, spyware and snoopware -- that secretly invade our computers as we download file-sharing programs or move from one Web site to the next. Experienced users who run detection software commonly find their machines infested with dozens of covert programs. The most sinister are illegally installed ''keystroke recorders,'' which allow remote users to capture secure passwords, Social Security numbers and other sensitive data, making victims especially vulnerable to fraud and information theft.
2/16/2004	MediaTalk; Hoping Next Merger Helps Sell Books on the Last One	Now that media merger mania is back in the air, thanks to the Comcast's Corporation unsolicited bid for the Walt Disney Company, publishers are hoping it revives popular interest in how it all went down the last time, when AOL and Time Warner became one. That merger, consummated in early 2001, yielded a boomlet of book deals. And now that all but one of those books are out, it is becoming possible to tell whether publishers have fared much better than the unhappy holders of Time Warner shares. The short answer is not really.
1/19/2004	As Consumers Revolt, a Rush to Block Pop-Up Online Ads	The boom in Internet pop-up advertisement may be about to, well, pop. The big ads that flash in separate windows above or below Web pages are among the most intrusive, and to many people, the most obnoxious features on the Internet. Not coincidentally, the pop-up format is also among the most effective for advertisers and the most profitable for Web site publishers.

1/12/2004	AOL Picks 3 Finalists In Review of Account	America Online, owned by Time Warner, has narrowed to three finalists a review for the media part of its $300 million account, which has been handled for seven years by Initiative Media in Los Angeles and New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
12/18/2003	AOL Will Buy Out Partners as Venture with DoCoMo Ends	NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone carrier, and several local partners said on Wednesday that they would dissolve their venture in Japan with America Online, which will buy all their shares. The venture, DoCoMo AOL Inc., was formed almost three years ago to offer software services that linked cellphones and computers through the Internet and other means. But DoCoMo said that rivals like Yahoo Japan had jumped into the market with competing products that made their partnership less relevant.
12/15/2003	America Online Selects 3 Finalists	America Online in Dulles, Va., has narrowed a review on the creative and media duties for its interactive advertising assignments to three finalists. Billings are estimated at $55 million to $60 million. Ruth Sarfaty, a spokeswoman at America Online, part of Time Warner, confirmed a report of the selections that appeared on Adweek.com. She identified the finalists as: the creative incumbent since July, AtmosphereBBDO in New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, working with an Omnicom sibling media agency, OMD; Digitas in New York; and Modem Media in Norwalk, Conn. The media planning and buying duties had been handled by Doner in Southfield, Mich., on a project basis.
12/12/2003	Bertelsmann Loses California Verdict	A California jury found Bertelsmann, the German media company, liable for the claims of two former managers who say they were due a share of the proceeds from the sale of Bertelsmann's half of AOL Europe, John Quinn, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said yesterday. The managers, Andreas von Blottnitz and Jan H. Buettner, had contended that Bertelsmann and its former chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff, promised them an equity stake in the joint venture between Bertelsmann and Time Warner Inc. Bertelsmann agreed to sell its stake to Time Warner in 2000 for $6.75 billion.
11/24/2003	Internet Users Shifting to Faster Services	Things are bleak, but not hopeless, for the companies that have been leading providers of dial-up Internet access, as the market shifts rapidly to faster broadband service, according to new research from ComScore Networks. In the third-quarter of the year, 24.5 million homes had broadband service, about one-third of the total homes with Internet access. Nearly all of them bought their access from their local telephone company or cable company, not America Online or Microsoft's MSN, the two leading dial-up providers. But Microsoft and AOL are having some success in persuading customers to use their services, in addition to cable or phone company broadband. SAUL HANSELL
11/24/2003	Interactive Account In Review at AOL	America Online in Dulles, Va., has begun a review for the creative and media duties for its interactive advertising assignments. Billings are estimated at $55 million to $60 million. The creative duties have been handled since July by AtmosphereBBDO in New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group. The media planning and buying duties have been handled by Doner in Southfield, Mich., an assignment the agency called a project.
11/13/2003	BOLDFACE NAMES	'Match Me, Sidney' Yes, it is true. Ours is the most glamorous job in New York. One night it's the National Arts Awards at the new Mandarin Oriental Hotel with CHUCK CLOSE and SOFIA COPPOLA, another evening the premiere for HBO's ''Angels in America'' with the show's director, MIKE NICHOLS, and DIANE SAWYER. (We loved the way Ms. Sawyer waved off questions with ''I'm just the wife.'' That modest little minx! We remember the MICHAEL JACKSON interview!)
10/9/2003	Closed Captions, Refreshed Without a Racing Typist	For deaf users, the Internet was initially a great leveler. But that is quickly changing. ''With broadband and multimedia, the Internet is moving away from being a level playing field,'' said Thomas Wlodkowski, the director of accessibility for America Online. Now AOL has begun to introduce closed captioning for some of the multimedia programming on the service. To develop its system, AOL formed a partnership with the Media Access Group at the Boston public television station WGBH, which introduced captioning to television during a 1972 broadcast of ''The French Chef'' with Julia Child.
10/6/2003	Spam Fighters Turn to Identifying Legitimate E-Mail	The software engineers helped create the spam problem. Can they solve it? As politicians have been racing to find ways to ban the junk e-mail known as spam, Internet providers have been boasting about filtering technologies capable of identifying the sort of messages typically sent by spammers and disposing of them.
9/25/2003	For Children, an AOL Playground With Games and a New Link Fence	America Online has long been both a jumping-off place and destination for children who are exploring cyberspace. On Sept. 29, it will introduce a version of its online service intended entirely for children. ''It's certainly not your mom and dad's AOL,'' said Malcolm Bird, an AOL senior vice president overseeing the new service.
9/25/2003	Microsoft's Rivals Won't Shut Chat Rooms	Microsoft's two major competitors in providing Internet services said yesterday that they had no plans to emulate its decision to shut down many free chat rooms in the United States and abroad. Free chat rooms have been among the most popular features of the Internet since long before its commercialization. But from the start, chat rooms have been considered a haven for criminal behavior, with child predators getting the most attention from law enforcement agencies. More recently, consumers have expressed frustration with the barrage of spam, including postings that link to pornographic sites.
9/24/2003	Guilty Pleas in Securities Case Widen AOL Inquiry	The Justice Department said yesterday that two senior executives of the now-defunct online commerce company PurchasePro have pleaded guilty to violating securities laws, escalating its larger related inquiry into America Online, the company's business partner . In unusually specific court filings, at least one PurchasePro executive, Jeffrey R. Anderson, told investigators that he conspired with executives of an unnamed media company based in Dulles, Va., to inflate improperly its advertising revenue by about $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. AOL is based in Dulles.
9/23/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Music Merger Talks	The EMI Group confirmed that it was in talks with AOL Time Warner about the recorded music group of Warner Music. The announcement followed the breakdown of talks between Warner Music and BMG last week and comes after the two let an exclusivity agreement lapse. People close to EMI said it could be months before anything concrete was accomplished. Foremost in the mind of EMI and Warner advisers is structuring a deal that will be approved by regulators, these people said. Opposition from European regulators derailed proposed combinations between EMI and Warner and between EMI and BMG in the last few years. EMI's offer is expected to value the Warner unit at about $1.5 billion, and give AOL two seats on its board. EMI was cautious in its statement: ''Discussions are at a very preliminary stage and there is no assurance that they will result in an agreement acceptable to both parties.'' Heather Timmons (NYT)
9/19/2003	Thanks to a Corporate Sponsor, The Post Will Be Free for a Day	The price war among New York's newspapers will hit a new low on Wednesday, when nearly a million copies of The New York Post will be distributed without charge as part of a promotion for America Online. America Online is paying The Post an undisclosed fee for the free distribution. It is part of the company's sponsorship of a free concert by the Dave Matthews Band in Central Park that night to benefit New York City public schools and its promotion of the latest version of AOL software.
9/19/2003	AOL Time Warner Drops the 'AOL'	Trapped in a troubled marriage, AOL Time Warner decided yesterday to return to its maiden name, dropping its first three letters. The company will now be called Time Warner, an attempt to erase a big reminder of the excesses of the Internet era, America Online's acquisition of Time Warner for shares priced at the peak of the boom.
9/18/2003	AOL Time Warner	The restoration has triumphed at the nation's largest media company; those pesky three letters, AOL, will probably be dropped from the corporate name. Time Warner's management figures that if Russia could do it after an unpleasant seven-decade-long experiment, it can do so after a mere three-year ordeal. Just go back to the old name and pretend it was all a bad dream. Erasing ''AOL'' isn't expected to cost Time Warner much beyond new stationery. It was adding the letters in the first place that proved rather costly. Almost $200 billion in shareholder value has been wiped out since the dot-com bubble's iconic merger between Stephen Case's scrappy Internet company and the venerable media empire founded by Henry Luce. Those responsible for the deal of the millennium are no longer in charge, of course, and their successors now want to ensure that shareholders no longer find themselves wincing, every time they look up the stock price, at the memory of how they were suckered by Mr. Case and his funny money. So the AOL stock symbol is being retired, too, to make way for the stolid old symbol, TWX.
9/17/2003	Record Labels In Merger Talks Said to Retreat	The long-running negotiation between AOL Time Warner and Bertelsmann about a merger of their music businesses appeared to be in doubt yesterday after the two companies let lapse an agreement to negotiate exclusively, executives close to the talks said. While AOL and Bertelsmann remain in discussions, the executives said, the removal of restrictions over negotiating with other record labels -- namely EMI -- is likely to complicate the talks even further.
9/16/2003	Marketers try twists on theme of wacky California politics.	MADISON Avenue is lustily warbling a commercialized version of ''California, Here I Come,'' rolling out humorous advertising and promotional efforts inspired by the state's recall election for governor. The funny campaigns about what many consider a funny campaign are sponsored by familiar brands like AOL, Mentos and Taco Bell. Even some media companies are getting into the act; for example, the Game Show Network plans a special featuring 6 of the 135 candidates, which it bills as the first-ever blend of debate and quiz program.
9/16/2003	AOL Time Warner Is Set To Sell Two Atlanta Teams	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it had reached an agreement to sell its N.B.A. and N.H.L. teams in Atlanta, the Hawks and the Thrashers, along with their arena. The company would not reveal the buyer until today, but it did say it was not the previously disclosed suitor. AOL Time Warner said it abandoned talks to sell the teams to David McDavid, the owner of a chain of car dealerships in Texas, after several months of exclusive talks came to a deadlock. McDavid did not respond to requests for comment.
9/15/2003	Profits in Missed Exits on Information Highway	Type in an Internet query, and inadvertently leave off the dot in .com, .net or .org. Or try to find, say, Target's Web site, but mistakenly tap www.taget in the browser. Everybody makes such mistakes. In fact, so many people mistype or misspell Web queries that some technology companies are trying to turn the lapses into lucre.
9/10/2003	Instant Messaging Pact Reached	The America Online division of AOL Time Warner reached an agreement yesterday with the Reuters Group to link their competing instant messaging services, raising new questions about the possibility of connecting with other such services from Yahoo and MSN. In the past, consumer advocates and communications regulators tried to press AOL, which operates by far the largest instant-messaging service, to connect with rivals so that users of all the services could obtain the benefits of communications with the broadest possible network of users, just as users of telephones, fax machines and e-mail do.
9/8/2003	A Growing AOL Europe Now Sets Example for U.S.	A few years ago, AOL Europe -- shorthand for America Online Europe -- seemed like an idea whose time might never come. As AOL soared at home through the 1990's, AOL Europe was mired in deep losses from uphill battles on the home turf of entrenched national competitors in Britain, France and Germany. But now AOL Europe is emerging as an upbeat counterpoint to AOL's sagging business in the United States. In the last two and a half years, AOL Europe has more than doubled its subscribers to 6.2 million and nearly doubled its revenue to about $1.4 billion. The European service has gradually cut its costs and its losses, and in the last quarter it finally broke even. In contrast, the larger AOL service, part of AOL Time Warner Inc., has more than 25 million members and robust profits in the United States, but it has lost 1.2 million members in the first half of the year. In the last quarter, its advertising revenue fell 48 percent from the previous year.
9/8/2003	Media Grow, but They Can't Hide	NBC's preliminary agreement last week to acquire the entertainment businesses of Vivendi Universal is the latest episode in a merger boom in the media business over the last eight years that has delivered control of the film, television and music industries in the United States to a half-dozen conglomerates. But the NBC deal could also signal the final stages of that merger mania. All six broadcast networks are tied to their film and television production studios, completing the soup-to-nuts integration of the broadcast business. And five companies -- Viacom, AOL Time Warner, Walt Disney, News Corporation and General Electric, the parent of the planned NBC Universal venture -- have carved up almost the entire broadcast and cable audience.
8/21/2003	F.C.C. Lifts Ban on Video For AOL Instant Messaging	The Federal Communications Commission has granted a request by AOL Time Warner to drop restrictions on adding video to its AOL instant messaging service until it allowed users to communicate with other services. The repeal has been expected for months. AOL, the largest instant messaging service with about 60 percent of the market by some measures, and its rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, are racing to add voice and video connections. The decision is of most concern to consumer advocates who hope instant messaging services develop interconnections for users of different systems to send instant messages to one another, just as customers of rival phone or e-mail services do.
8/14/2003	Homestore Settles Suit Over Its Accounting	Homestore, an online real estate services company that provides listings to America Online, said yesterday that it had agreed to pay about $70 million in cash and stock to settle a class-action lawsuit over accusations of accounting fraud. The suit, filed by the California State Teachers' Retirement System as the lead plaintiff, attracted widespread attention because it included accusations that AOL Time Warner and Homestore colluded to defraud their shareholders.
8/12/2003	Jury Rules Against Microsoft in Patent Case	A federal jury awarded a former University of California researcher $521 million today in a lawsuit against Microsoft that asserted its Explorer Web browser infringed a patent for sending software applications over the Internet. The lawsuit, which was filed in 1999 by Michael Doyle, now a Chicago businessman and founder of Eolas Technologies Inc., and the University of California, had sought $1.2 billion. The plaintiffs asserted that the invention had been crucial in permitting Microsoft to compete against the Netscape Navigator Web browser, now owned by AOL Time Warner Inc.
8/12/2003	AOL Seeks a Separation in Name Only	The AOL Internet service is pushing to delete its name from AOL Time Warner two and a half years after it imposed those same three letters on the biggest media company in the world. When AOL acquired Time Warner, its executives insisted on putting AOL at the front of the name, executives who were involved said last week. But in a written proposal last week to the company's chairman, Richard D. Parsons, the AOL division's chief executive, Jon Miller, asked to drop the letters AOL, apparently to protect the brand from the stigma of the larger company's problems.
7/31/2003	Fortifying the In Box as Spammers Lay Siege	WHILE Congress continues to struggle with just how strict to make laws that regulate unwanted e-mail, technology is evolving to curb it, or at least separate the wheat from the chaff. Microsoft, Eudora, America Online and other software makers and Internet service providers have improved their spam filters in response to the steady increase in annoying messages sent by direct marketers, political activists and practical jokers. Yet while many applications and services filter spam, there are subtle differences among them that can affect system performance, filtering speed and accuracy.
7/31/2003	S.E.C. Investigates Bulk Sales Of AOL Internet Subscriptions	The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked the America Online division of AOL Time Warner to provide documents about its bulk subscription program, according to a person close to the company. The S.E.C. move, which was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, was described in an e-mail message from AOL's legal department that asked employees ''to preserve hard copy and electronic documents, e-mail, and computer contents'' about the bulk-subscription program, as well as materials related to the ways that the company counts its subscribers.
7/24/2003	AOL Results Do Not Shake Investor Worry	Continuing accounting troubles and a steep decline in the number of America Online subscribers overshadowed an otherwise rosy report yesterday of second-quarter results at AOL Time Warner. Shares of the company fell nearly 7 percent yesterday, to $15.71, after increasing more than 50 percent over the last 12 months. The reaction underscores the difficult task AOL Time Warner still faces in restoring the confidence of investors, who have been disappointed by the results of AOL's acquisition of Time Warner two and a half years ago.
7/22/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: F.T.C. Settles Suit Against Youth In Net Fraud	The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that it had settled a lawsuit against a 17-year-old California boy who used unsolicited e-mail messages and a fraudulent America Online Web page to gain access to credit card information and steal thousands of dollars from consumers. The boy, who was not identified because he is a minor, will be required to pay $3,500 in consumer repayment, officials said. Timothy J. Muris, the chairman of the F.T.C., said the case was the first focused on an Internet scheme called phishing, in which spam e-mail messages are used to lure computer users to look-alike or counterfeit Web sites, where they are then encouraged to supply personal financial data. Officials said the teenager created a fraudulent AOL Web site, which included the company's logo and links to legitimate AOL Web pages, seeking credit card numbers, billing addresses, Social Security numbers and AOL screen names and passwords. ''Phishing is a two-time scam,'' Mr. Muris said. ''Phishers first steal a company's identity and then use it to victimize consumers by stealing their credit identities.''
7/18/2003	AOL Time Warner Expected to Announce 2 More Sales to Cut Debt	AOL Time Warner, seeking to reduce its debt, is expected to announce two sales of businesses within the next week. AOL Time Warner is expected to announce today that it has agreed to sell its CD and DVD manufacturing business for $1.04 billion to Cinram International of Toronto, the largest maker of those discs, people briefed on the negotiations said. Representatives of Cinram could be not be reached for comment.
7/15/2003	AOL Defense: It Was Doing What It Said It Would Do	AOL Time Warner fired the first salvo in its defense against a lawsuit from angry shareholders yesterday, contending that it had disclosed for years the business practices some are now calling fraud. The company's motion to dismiss the suit is an expected part of the proceedings, and legal scholars consider it unlikely to succeed. But the relative strength of AOL Time Warner's legal defense will help determine how costly it is for the company to resolve the suit, most likely through a settlement payment.
7/7/2003	Shares Are Up, But Lawsuits May Unsettle AOL's Future	The shareholder lawsuits accusing AOL Time Warner of accounting fraud are just getting started, but a slip-up by a federal judge may have offered an early clue to the outcome. In what one legal scholar called ''the judicial equivalent of a Freudian slip,'' Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of United States District Court in Manhattan responded to a preliminary letter from shareholders' lawyers by ordering AOL Time Warner to turn over millions of pages of documents before the lawyers filed a formal motion or the company had a chance to respond. When AOL Time Warner's lawyers complained, she quickly rescinded the order.
7/1/2003	You've Got Merger: Inside the AOL-Time Warner Deal	STEALING TIME Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner By Alec Klein Illustrated. 336 pages. Simon & Schuster. $25.95. The title of Alec Klein's new book, ''Stealing Time,'' says it all.
6/30/2003	Sex and Death Just Like HBO, But Showtime Gets No Love	The sixth season premiere of ''Sex and the City'' on HBO this month did not just represent the return of a popular sitcom to television. It was a cultural happening. CNN broke from reports on Iraq and the Laci Peterson murder case to debate whether the show had lost its edge. Katie Couric and Matt Lauer of ''Today'' on NBC fretted that ''Sex and the City'' had too much of it. Magazines and newspapers devoted covers and vast space inside to the show's latest fashions and ribald sex scenes. The New York Post even heralded the show's return with a front-page headline: ''The Best 'Sex' Ever.''
6/26/2003	Animated Icons Add Spice to IM Conversations	Forget about abbreviations and punctuation marks. For instant-messaging devotees, the tools for adding a smile or a wink will soon turn emoticons into animation. America Online says that Version 9.0 of its software, to be released this summer, will introduce a new breed of instant-messaging icon called the SuperBuddy: fully animated thumbnail-size dragons, starfish, and other emblems that project the message sender's mood and persona as they spin, bob and seemingly kiss the computer screen next to messages. Developed by animators who have worked on films like ''Shrek'' and ''Toy Story,'' the SuperBuddies are enhancements of the flat Buddy images available in AOL 8.0.
6/23/2003	Accounts	* AOL Time Warner interactive video group, New York, to the New York office of Wieden & Kennedy, to handle the account of Mystro TV, a digital cable service under development. Billings were estimated at $5 million to $10 million. The agency's main office in Portland, Ore., was named last week to handle corporate brand duties for America Online. * Priceline.com, Norwalk, Conn., the online seller of discounted travel services, to MediaVest USA, New York, to serve as a consultant on media planning duties, which are handled internally. Spending is estimated at $30 million to $40 million. Ocean Media, Huntington Beach, Calif., handles media buying. MediaVest is part of the MediaVest Worldwide division of the Starcom MediaVest Group, a unit of the Publicis Groupe.
6/22/2003	AOL Merger: Dissecting a Deal That Soured	THE wreckage of America Online's misbegotten takeover of Time Warner for stock now appears the greatest enduring monument to the folly of the Internet boom. And Alec Klein, a reporter for The Washington Post, already has a place in its history. Last July, he wrote a groundbreaking series of articles in The Post describing adventures in creative accounting by the AOL service's online advertising sales team around the time of the merger. Within weeks, AOL Time Warner acknowledged that both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department had begun investigations into its books.
6/12/2003	AOL Time Warner Warns of Rift With Bertelsmann	The German media giant Bertelsmann's recent withdrawal from a proposed deal to buy the book division of AOL Time Warner has chilled relations between the companies and could derail talks about merging their music divisions, AOL executives said yesterday. The actions by Bertelsmann, which made a last-minute pullback from the book deal last week, illuminated internal differences and strict financial constraints under the management of its chief executive, Gunter Thielen, who succeeded Thomas Middelhoff after his abrupt departure last summer. The end of the book talks was also a setback for Peter Olson, the chairman of Bertelsmann's Random House book publishing division and the only American on the company's executive board, Random House executives said.
6/12/2003	Cable Is Confident of Internet Lead Over Phone Rivals	The cable industry has grown up, and it has taken on a new swagger. The industry that started out with the transmission of television programs has matured into a broad-ranging provider of telecommunications, using digital technology to offer video-on-demand, phone service and, in particular, high-speed Internet connections.
6/10/2003	America Online decides that two agencies are better.	CAN the agency that urges consumers to ''Just do it'' on behalf of Nike just do it for the struggling America Online division of AOL Time Warner? And can the agency accomplish that daunting task with a second shop sharing the client? Madison Avenue eagerly awaits the answers to those questions after the surprising decision yesterday by America Online to name a pair of agencies to work on its estimated $200 million account. The decision to use two, two, two agencies at once came after a five-month review that began with the unexpected firing of the longtime America Online shop, Gotham in New York.
6/5/2003	His Network Has a Stripper, but No Solicitors, Please	LATER rather than sooner comes the main confession from Steve Mendelsohn, executive director of Manhattan Neighborhood Network, the public access television station that is the ultimate bully pulpit for Manhattanites wishing to vent in its freebie studios, as long as they vent without resorting to obscenity, violence or, the ultimate MNN no-no, sales schemes. Psychics and personal trainers, don't go posting your cellphone numbers around here. This minuscule venture may draw the bulk of its $3 million annual operating budget from AOL Time Warner -- a fiscal quid pro quo the city demanded of Time Warner in return for allowing it to tear up sidewalks to install its cable system -- but it is a bastion of noncorporate ideals. At least until its franchise is up for renewal in 2008.
6/2/2003	Digital Media Becomes Focus As Microsoft And AOL Settle	The corporate armistice declared last week between Microsoft and AOL Time Warner reflected two companies moving from the past to the future. The abandoned past included a last lingering vestige of the Internet browser wars of the 1990's, a private antitrust suit that Microsoft has now agreed to pay AOL Time Warner $750 million to settle.
5/31/2003	AOL Emerges With the Edge In the Truce With Microsoft	AOL Time Warner and Microsoft presented the agreement they announced Thursday as a new era of cooperation between two longtime rivals. But on closer inspection, the terms of the deal largely require Microsoft to cooperate with AOL while inviting AOL to reciprocate at its pleasure. That suggests that Microsoft is not gaining any particular advantage as it seeks to conquer new software markets related to the Internet, including instant messaging and digital distribution of audio and video programming.
5/30/2003	MICROSOFT TO PAY AOL $750 MILLION; END TO 'LONG WAR'	Microsoft agreed to pay AOL Time Warner $750 million in a legal settlement yesterday that ends one of the most bitter rivalries in modern corporate history and commits the two companies to a sweeping program of business cooperation. Under the agreement, Microsoft will grant AOL a seven-year royalty-free license to its Internet browsing software, and faster and greater access to Microsoft's Windows operating system. That will make it easier for AOL's popular online service to work with Windows software, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.
5/27/2003	AOL Founder Is Said to Be Open to a Spinoff	Stephen M. Case, mastermind of America Online's record-breaking acquisition of Time Warner, has begun to talk favorably of undoing the deal by spinning off AOL, according to two senior company officials who have spoken with him. Mr. Case's opinions may have little effect on AOL Time Warner's future, however, because of his waning power at the company. His views may even reflect his own frustration with his changing status.
5/26/2003	As Instant Messaging Comes of Age, AOL Fears F.C.C. Rule Holds It Back	As Internet instant messaging heads beyond simple text to audio-video interactions, AOL Time Warner says it is in danger of falling behind, partly because of conditions the government set in approving AOL's acquisition of Time Warner more than two years ago. Through its America Online and other instant messaging services, the company now dominates the field, serving more than 59 million of the estimated 77 million Americans who used an online instant messaging system last month. But as AOL and its rivals in the field, Microsoft and Yahoo, prepare to roll out high-speed instant messaging that allows people to see and talk to one another, AOL Time Warner says it fears that regulatory restrictions will place it at a disadvantage.
5/22/2003	Metro Briefing | New York: Queens: More Internet Fraud Charges	A Queens teenager already free on bail in an Internet fraud case was arrested again yesterday and charged with defrauding AOL customers by stealing their credit card numbers. District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens said the teenager, Shiva Brent Sharma, continued to run a fraud scheme out of his parents' Richmond Hill home even while awaiting trial on similar charges filed in December. In the latest case, Mr. Brown said Mr. Sharma, 18, would log onto the Internet and trick AOL customers into providing him with their credit card information. He then charged more than $30,000 worth of items, including laptop computers, digital cameras, cellphones and plasma television sets that he then auctioned off, also through the Internet, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Sharma was charged this time with first-degree identity theft, grand larceny and scheming to defraud. His lawyer, Thaddeus J. McGuire, said Mr. Sharma was innocent of the December charges but had not spoken to him about the latest charges. Corey Kilgannon (NYT)
5/21/2003	Miscellany	* ING U.S. Financial Services, Atlanta, part of the ING Group, signed a $30 million, three-year content and marketing agreement with the Global Marketing Solutions group of AOL Time Warner, New York. ING will use content from AOL Time Warner units like CNNMoney.com and DC Comics on a new personal finance Web site, INGmoneymentor.com, and will advertise the site on AOL Time Warner properties.
5/20/2003	E-MAIL'S BACKDOOR OPEN TO SPAMMERS	At first, it looked as if some students at the Flint Hills School, a prep academy in Oakton, Va., had found a lucrative alternative to an after-school job. Late last year, technicians at America Online traced a new torrent of spam, or unsolicited e-mail advertisements, to the school's computer network. On further inquiry, though, AOL determined that the spammers were not enterprising students. Instead, a spam-flinging hacker -- who still has not been found -- had exploited a software vulnerability to use Flint Hills' computers to relay spam while hiding the e-mail's true origins.
5/17/2003	Case Re-elected To AOL Board; Margin Is Called Underwhelming	After months of behind-the-scenes maneuvers, some large shareholders of AOL Time Warner delivered an open rebuke today to Stephen M. Case, the former chairman, and two of his close associates by withholding votes in their re-election as directors at the company's annual meeting. After a heated two-hour meeting at a hotel here, Mr. Case and his colleagues were re-elected to the board, but with far fewer votes than the rest of the directors. As in most corporate elections, no alternative candidates were nominated, but by lowering the percentage of votes Mr. Case and his colleagues received, the shareholders signaled that they were still angry over Mr. Case's role as the architect of America Online's ill-fated purchase of Time Warner. Mr. Case's resignation did not fully appease his critics. Now some, including the largest shareholder, Capital Research and Management, are pressing to remove him from the board.
5/16/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: KaZaA Operator Told To Disclose Investors	AOL Time Warner, Sony and other entertainment companies suing the operator of the KaZaA online file-sharing system will be able to learn who has invested in it, a federal judge ruled yesterday. Magistrate Judge Patrick J. Walsh in Los Angeles ordered the company, Sharman Networks Ltd., to produce a list of investors, as well as lenders that declined invitations to invest. The company also has to provide the names of all its managers and directors, the judge said. Record companies and music publishers have begun suing investors and individual users in music-swapping services in their battle against what they say is piracy that costs them billions of dollars annually in lost sales. In a suit filed last month, Vivendi Universal and the EMI Group accused Hummer Winblad Venture Partners of contributing to copyright infringement through Hummer's investment of $13 million in Napster Inc., which is now defunct. Roderick Dorman, a lawyer for Sharman, did not immediately return a call for comment.
5/15/2003	Instant Messaging Moves Beyond Chat to Multimedia	''I'M pretty much on instant messaging from when I get home until I go to bed,'' said Laura Gittleson, a 15-year-old in Colts Neck, N.J. She is not alone. America Online, the service Ms. Gittleson uses, says 195 million people use its instant messaging service, their keystrokes generating more than 1.6 billion messages a day. For those users, instant messaging -- or IM -- has become an intrinsic part of their social fabric.
5/13/2003	AOL Picks Chief for Broadband Service	The America Online division of AOL Time Warner yesterday named Kevin Conroy, senior vice president and general manager of AOL Entertainment, to the new position of executive vice president and chief operating officer of broadband service. The company said the promotion of Mr. Conroy, 43, signaled its commitment to multimedia programming best viewed over high-speed Internet connections.
5/13/2003	Turner Drops Out Of Games Bidding	AOL Time Warner dropped out of the bidding to acquire the media rights to the 2010 and 2012 Olympics yesterday, citing the rigorous definition of a broadcast network by the International Olympic Committee. AOL Time Warner had hoped to persuade the I.O.C. that WB, a baby broadcast network, would be part of its bid, along with CNN, TNT and TBS. But WB did not meet the I.O.C.'s definition of a traditional broadcast network.
5/10/2003	PENSION FUND WILL NOT VOTE FOR AOL DIRECTORS	The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest pension fund in the nation, said yesterday that it would not vote for five AOL Time Warner Inc. directors. The fund, known as Calpers, questioned the directors' independence and the roles they played on the audit committee of AOL Time Warner. Calpers said it would withhold votes from James Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape; Stephen Bollenbach, former chief executive of the Hilton Hotels Corporation; Fay Vincent, the former Major League Baseball commissioner; Franklin Raines, the chairman of Fannie Mae; and Miles Gilburne, managing director of ZG Ventures. Calpers holds 20.4 million shares of AOL Time Warner. Because there are only 13 nominees, all of them are likely to secure positions on the board regardless of Calpers's votes.
5/8/2003	For Tower Residents, a New Math	EXCITED about his purchase of a $2 million, 67th-floor apartment at the AOL Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle, the buyer decided to sit in Central Park on a spring afternoon and count the floors. ''It was presented as an 80-story building,'' said the homeowner, a marketing executive for an international company, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''I kept counting and coming up with 69 floors. If I'm right, I'm 13 floors lower. I'd be on 56. That's terribly disappointing.'' While the practice of misnumbering floors in some of the city's most opulent buildings has been going on for some time -- starting, of course, with omitting the 13th floor to appease the superstitious -- the sleight of hand has become more blatant with the arrival of Trump World Tower, opposite the United Nations, and the double towers being developed by the Related Companies for the AOL Time Warner complex, projects whose sex appeal and marketability turn, at least in part, on their soaring height.
5/6/2003	Turner Sells A Huge Block Of AOL Stock	Ted Turner, the vice chairman and largest individual shareholder of AOL Time Warner, said yesterday that he had sold about 60 million shares, more than half his holdings, for about $790 million. People close to Mr. Turner said that the sale reflected his growing disenchantment with the company's prospects. He effectively capitulated to the 70 percent decline in the share price over the last two years, giving up hope of a significant rebound soon. It was unclear why he picked yesterday to unload such a large stake.
5/6/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Electronic Arts To Develop Superman Games	Electronic Arts, the video game maker, said yesterday that it had won rights from AOL Time Warner to develop games based on the Superman character. Warner Brothers Entertainment and DC Comics, both AOL units, sold multiyear rights beginning in 2004 to Electronic Arts to make Superman games for personal computers, video game consoles and hand-held computers, said Shelly Eckenroth, an outside spokeswoman for Electronic Arts. Terms were not disclosed. Electronic Arts also said it had started developing ''The Sims 2,'' with improved graphics and more complex relationships among the characters, which the players control. ''The Sims Deluxe'' was No. 14 in March sales among software products using Microsoft's Windows operating system, the NPD Group/NPD Techworld said. Electronic Arts said it would publish games based on a Superman film in production by Warner Brothers. The company also said it won the right to make games based on Superman comic books. Release dates have not been set for the Superman games, Ms. Eckenroth said. Shares of Electronic Arts rose 36 cents, to $62.14, on Nasdaq.
5/5/2003	In HBO, AOL Sees a Sibling And, Crucially, A Role Model	For the last six months, Jonathan Miller, the chief executive of the America Online division of AOL Time Warner, has pointed to the company's own cable channel HBO as the blueprint for a revival of the shrinking AOL service. His plan is to sell subscriptions to the online equivalent of must-see programming like ''The Sopranos'' that consumers cannot find anywhere else. It is an analogy that evokes cringes back at HBO headquarters, where some complain that Mr. Miller is reversing its history, two senior executives said. HBO started by persuading cable operators around the country to offer the channel, and only after it was the largest premium channel could it then afford to produce its own shows.
4/29/2003	AOL Book Unit Said to Be Down to One Suitor	AOL Time Warner, entering the final stage of an auction for its book publishing division as it seeks to reduce its debt, is left negotiating with just one publishing house, the six-year-old Perseus Books Group, two people involved in the process said yesterday. The bumpy sales process might still entice the media company Bertelsmann, parent of Random House, or another publisher.
4/28/2003	3 E-Mail Giants Will Join In an Effort to Reduce Spam	The three leading providers of e-mail accounts said yesterday that they had started to work together to develop ways to reduce the unwanted commercial messages, commonly known as spam, that are increasingly clogging their customers' mailboxes. The companies -- America Online, Microsoft and Yahoo -- are calling for technical changes in the way e-mail is passed around cyberspace to make it easier to determine who really sent it and what it is about.
4/24/2003	AOL's First-Quarter Results Surpass Chief's Forecast	AOL Time Warner reported a larger-than-expected quarterly profit yesterday. It was the first earnings release since America Online acquired Time Warner more than two years ago that was not marred by unpleasant surprises. Investors are watching closely for signs the company might get back on its feet after Time Warner's historic miscalculation of agreeing to sell itself for AOL shares in January 2001, at the peak of the Internet boom.
4/23/2003	Viacom Reports a Profit; Radio Unit Is Still Troubled	Viacom posted solid first-quarter results yesterday on a strong performance from its cable networks, television and video businesses. But poor performance at its radio business continued to worry investors and management. The company reported net income of $443.1 million, or 25 cents a share, reversing a loss of $1.1 billion, or 64 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, when it took a big write-down on assets. Revenue, which benefited from strong advertiser spending, rose 6.7 percent, to $6.05 billion from $5.67 billion.
4/21/2003	What's $400 Million Between Friends?	Stephen M. Case visits the Rockefeller Plaza headquarters of AOL Time Warner only occasionally these days, and he turns up even more infrequently at his old office in the AOL division in Vienna, Va., executives who work with him say. But Mr. Case, 44, who formally departs next month as the company's chairman, still communicates often by e-mail and instant messaging with his old friend Thomas Middelhoff, 49, a fellow fallen mogul who resigned as the chairman of the German media giant Bertelsmann last summer, colleagues of both men said.
4/15/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: AOL Sues Five Over Unsolicited E-Mail	America Online filed suit yesterday against five marketers it accuses of being responsible for sending more than one billion unsolicited e-mail advertisements to its members. As AOL's subscriber count has started to decline, the company, which is the biggest Internet provider in the United States, has stepped up its efforts to fight the more obnoxious aspects of the Internet, including pop-up advertisements and unsolicited e-mail, known as spam. The lawsuits seek monetary damages of at least $10 million and court orders to halt further spam. The lawsuits were filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va. One defendant is Michael Levesque, identified as the proprietor of BrightNight/WebXTasy, a purveyor of pornography, based in Issaquah, Wash. Another is George Moore, of Maryland Internet Marketing, which sells software. AOL also filed suit against three other e-mail marketers, which it did not name. Filing suit will allow the company to subpoena records and identify the marketers. Mr. Moore and Mr. Levesque have unlisted phone numbers. There were no replies yesterday to e-mail messages sent to addresses associated with the e-mail domains that were identified by AOL. Saul Hansell (NYT)
4/15/2003	Lawsuits Say AOL Investors Were Misled	Two teams of lawyers representing shareholders in AOL Time Warner are filing extensive complaints accusing the company of defrauding investors, opening a legal battle that could determine the extent of the company's liability for AOL's disappointing acquisition of Time Warner in 2001. The outcome of the lawsuits will also say a great deal about the credibility of the new management of AOL Time Warner, including Richard D. Parsons, who took over as chief executive last year and will become chairman next month. After an internal investigation under Mr. Parsons last fall, AOL Time Warner acknowledged that it had improperly overstated its advertising revenue by about $190 million, mostly at its AOL division, over 18 months that ended last spring. Then two weeks ago the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was questioning an additional $400 million in revenue, and now, in the first concrete assessments made by critics outside the company, the lawsuits contend that the company inflated its results by far more significant sums -- as much as $1.7 billion or more.
4/14/2003	Compressed Data; An AOL Service Allows Friends and Relatives To Follow the Troops	Zaneta Burkett of La Plata, Md., has been worried about her sister-in-law, who is stationed with an engineering unit in the Middle East. But she has been able to follow the movements of the 3rd or 4th Infantry Divisions through messages that pop up on her computer screen. ''I'd get an alert saying '45 miles to Baghdad,' she said. ''I knew exactly where they were.'' Ms. Burkett subscribes to the U.S. Forces Alerts, a feature on America Online that enables AOL subscribers to receive instant alerts to help them keep tabs on up to 76 specific military units in Iraq. (Ms. Burkett's sister-in-law is not in those units, but her location is often dictated by the movements of the 3rd and 4th Infantry Divisions.)
4/9/2003	AOL Time Warner in Talks To Sell Its Atlanta Teams	AOL Time Warner, under pressure to reduce its heavy debt load, is in discussions with at least two bidders to sell the Atlanta Braves and its two other Atlanta sports teams, an executive briefed on the talks said yesterday. One bidder is a group led by Dave Checketts, the former chief executive of Madison Square Garden, the executive said. Separately, the company said it was confident enough in its attempts to raise more cash that it had decided to borrow an additional $812 million to use cash instead of stock to buy back a stake in AOL Europe.
4/9/2003	Fire Is Latest Setback at AOL Time Warner Tower in Columbus Circle	Early yesterday morning, in a city blanketed by rain and sleet and snow, the AOL Time Warner Center, a 53-story building rising on Columbus Circle, briefly caught fire. Injuries were minor, and damage was confined to a few floors, but this latest setback underscored the project's rotten luck.
4/1/2003	Market Place; A sales deal with Bertelsmann restores AOL to the unwanted attention of regulators.	RICHARD D. PARSONS, AOL Time Warner's chief executive, must wonder when it will be safe to sound upbeat instead of contrite. It will not this week, nor anytime soon. On Friday, the company disclosed that federal investigators were questioning another piece of the company's accounting, a deal with Bertelsmann that added as much as $400 million in revenue over two years.
3/31/2003	Madonna, Institution and Rebel, But Not Quite the Diva of Old She Once Was	This is how the music world is changing: Madonna, who has been a pop diva for two decades, may be looking at the final stages of a long career. She crashed and burned last year in the movie ''Swept Away,'' a project with her husband, Guy Ritchie, who directed the film. And her most recent albums, with their underground European techno beats, have failed to capture audiences anywhere near the size of those that bought her earlier albums. She has sold about $200 million in CD's and other products throughout her 20-year career.
3/29/2003	AOL Says S.E.C. Is Questioning Its Accounting Of $400 Million	AOL Time Warner disclosed yesterday that securities regulators investigating the company's accounting suspect that it improperly overstated its revenue by up to $400 million over two years, indicating that its accounting problems may be far worse than the company has previously acknowledged. The figure in question is more than twice as large as a previous overstatement the company acknowledged last fall, potentially bringing the total to as much as $590 million.
3/28/2003	In Blow to AOL, a British Publisher Won't Bid for Its Book Unit	AOL Time Warner suffered a setback yesterday in its efforts to sell its book publishing division when the British bookseller W. H. Smith withdrew from the auction. The withdrawal came after statements earlier in the week from another possible bidder, Bertelsmann, indicating that it was wary of new acquisitions. People involved in the auction of the book division -- which includes Warner Books and Little, Brown -- have said that the company hopes to find a buyer within several weeks, but that the uncertainty surrounding the war in Iraq has diminished the interest of many companies.
3/27/2003	People	* Nancy Hill was named executive vice president and managing director to oversee a new account at BBDO Worldwide, New York, part of the Omnicom Group. Ms. Hill will supervise the account of a new service of America Online, part of AOL Time Warner, called AOL for Broadband. Ms. Hill had been executive vice president and managing director at the New York office of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, which is part of the Interpublic Group.
3/24/2003	Beyond War News, AOL's Broadband Plan May Face a Struggle	America Online had hoped that the Academy Awards ceremony would be a glamorous occasion for kicking off its new service for customers with high-speed, or broadband, connections. So even though the war in Iraq caused Hollywood to scale back some of its usual pomp, AOL officials decided late last week to proceed with plans to begin a splashy new advertising campaign featuring a commercial with Sharon Stone in bed with AOL's ''running man'' icon. The war does create an opportunity for AOL to show, rather than simply tell, some of what its new service can do. It has a fair bit of video news from ABC and CNN. And it has a host of features, like one that lets family members upload photographs of relatives serving in Iraq.
3/19/2003	Togetherness at AOL Time Warner Is Not High on Turner's Agenda	Ted Turner is still not ready for his exit from AOL Time Warner, at least not while there is still an audience eager for his personal views and antics. Mr. Turner, vice chairman of AOL Time Warner, said for the first time yesterday that he would most likely remain on the board even after he leaves his executive role in May. And he offered some of the comments that he has shared with his fellow directors, like suggesting that AOL Time Warner might be better off without its troubled America Online division.
3/17/2003	AOL and Harvard Plan Film Grants	AOL Time Warner and Harvard University will announce this week that they are starting a grant program to support documentarians seeking to make films about the black experience in the United States. The grants were the brainchild of Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the university's Department of Afro-American Studies and the director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research. Through contacts at HBO, he took the idea to the chairman of AOL Time Warner, Richard D. Parsons, who agreed to back the program, he said.
3/17/2003	Betting on Speed, Pure and Simple; In Broadband, Comcast Lets Users Find Their Own Flourishes	High-speed service may be the future of the Internet, but it has been nothing but trouble for most companies involved. Comcast, the newly crowned king of cable, is the accidental exception. So far the three leaders that emerged in the first Internet wave, with service based on slow telephone modems -- America Online, Microsoft's MSN, and Earthlink -- have attracted few customers for the speedier access known as broadband. And they have lost considerable money trying to resell fast connections bought wholesale from cable or telephone providers.
3/13/2003	Several Suitors Bid for AOL Time Warner's Book Division	The first round of AOL Time Warner's auction of its book publishing division drew preliminary bids from several suitors, including the Random House unit of Bertelsmann and the British bookseller W. H. Smith. AOL Time Warner is under pressure to pay off some of its roughly $29 billion in debt, and it initially hoped to raise $400 million from the sale of the division, which consists of Warner Books and Little, Brown. But the ultimate price may well fall below that because one of the leading candidates to buy the books unit, the HarperCollins division of the News Corporation, publicly dropped out of the bidding on Tuesday.
3/12/2003	AOL Providing Software to Customers to Block Pop-Ups	With the fervor of a newly converted teetotaler, America Online, which swore off selling pop-up advertisements in October, is now giving its users software that will block pop-up ads on other Web sites. AOL pioneered the often annoying but effective pop-up format, which opens a window on the screen, covering whatever the user was trying to do. Over the last two years, many other Web sites have started selling pop-up ads or pop-under ads, which become visible after the user closes the main browser window. For many users, pop-ups have joined junk e-mail, or spam, as one of their biggest online annoyances.
3/12/2003	News Corp. Won't Bid for AOL Book Units	The News Corporation, the media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said yesterday that its HarperCollins unit would not bid for the book publishing business of AOL Time Warner. ''It's just not the right time for an acquisition of this size,'' a News Corporation spokesman, Andrew Butcher, said. The deputy chief operating officer, Lachlan Murdoch, said last month that the company, based in Sydney, Australia, was not interested in AOL Time Warner's book business at the reported asking price.
3/11/2003	Instant Messaging Leaves School for Office	Instant messaging, long associated with teenagers staying up late to chat online with friends, is moving into the workplace with an impact that has started to rival e-mail and the cellphone. Less intrusive than a phone call and more immediate than e-mail, instant messaging is finding users far more quickly than e-mail did when it was first introduced, according to Forrester Research, a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. In the last year alone, Forrester said, the number of instant messages has grown by more than 50 percent, so that nearly one-third of American adults are now IM-ing, as it is called, with their children, clients, colleagues and each other.
3/10/2003	AOL Is Planning a Fast-Forward Answer to TiVo	Personal video recorders like TiVo mock everything a television network is about. The devices let viewers thumb their noses at program schedules and, even worse, fast-forward past commercials. To many at the networks and studios, it is a cruel joke that could drive them out of business. AOL Time Warner, however, is trying to beat TiVo Inc. at its own game.
3/10/2003	AOL Narrows the Field In Search for an Agency	America Online in Dulles, Va., has narrowed a review for the brand-image part of its $150 million account to two finalists. In the meantime, one finalist was awarded a big assignment, to promote a new America Online product, high-speed Internet services. The finalists for the brand-image duties, which were placed in review on Jan. 10, are BBDO Worldwide in New York and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. BBDO New York, part of the Omnicom Group, was awarded the high-speed Internet assignment, to promote AOL Broadband, with spending estimated at a third to a half of the total account.
3/10/2003	Charges Dismissed Against Cendant and AOL	A federal judge in Los Angeles has dismissed claims against Cendant and AOL Time Warner in a closely watched shareholders' lawsuit over losses at the Internet real estate company Homestore, the companies said over the weekend. Lawyers for the California State Teachers' Retirement System have filed a shareholders' suit against certain Homestore executives, accusing them of inflating the company's results. The suit asserts that Cendant; an executive, Richard A. Smith; AOL Time Warner and some of its executives in effect helped Homestore exaggerate its results by concocting bogus advertising deals.
3/7/2003	AOL Reported in Talks to Sell Disc Manufacturing Business	AOL Time Warner is in talks about selling the CD and DVD manufacturing business of its Warner Music division as part of continuing efforts to pay down its roughly $29 billion in debt, executives briefed on the talks said yesterday. One executive said the company hoped to make as much as $1 billion from the sale. The business, which also produces DVD's for AOL Time Warner's film division, has been the fastest-growing part of Warner Music's income as the music industry has slid into a downturn.
3/6/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: AOL Announces Measures Taken On Spam	America Online said yesterday that unsolicited e-mail, or spam, had doubled on its service in six months and that the company had reached a new milestone: more than a billion unsolicited e-mail messages blocked in a day. The staggering ''volume of unsolicited e-mail that AOL is trying to manage,'' the company said, ''reflects the significant and continuing attacks that spammers have launched against Internet consumers, a major issue facing the industry.'' AOL 8.0 software, which was released in October, has a ''report spam'' button that allows users to flag e-mail messages that have evaded its antispam filters. AOL executives have said that spam is the chief complaint among its 27 million members, who are using the spam button to alert the company's engineers to about 5.5 million pieces of spam a day, up from about 4 million a day less than two weeks ago.
2/25/2003	2 Rival Houses Said to Consider Bids to Acquire AOL Book Unit	Seeking to sell its book publishing division, AOL Time Warner has elicited interest from two potential bidders, Random House, a unit of Bertelsmann, and HarperCollins, part of the News Corporation, people involved in the talks said yesterday. All discussions have been preliminary and no terms have been discussed, the people said.
2/20/2003	Turner Plans Role as Gadfly Without Portfolio	Some thought Ted Turner's resignation last month as vice chairman of AOL Time Warner might muffle his often unruly voice in its management. But Mr. Turner is letting it be known that he has just begun to roar. ''Only a bullet will stop me,'' he said in a recent interview with the CanWest News Service. ''I couldn't do very much inside except raise my hand and object.''
2/15/2003	No Waiting in Line, Just Online; Moviegoers Say Buying in Advance Can Be Confusing, Not Convenient	Going to the latest movie used to mean long lines and the prospect of reaching the box office just as the last seat was spoken for. Then about a decade ago, many moviegoers in the New York region figured out that they could avoid the hassle by ordering tickets in advance. Now some people are discovering that even that is not as easy as it used to be.
2/14/2003	Talks Collapse on Plan to Merge CNN With ABC News	Larry King and Barbara Walters will not play for the same team after all. AOL Time Warner has formally ended talks with the Walt Disney Company to merge CNN and ABC News. AOL Time Warner executives told Disney yesterday that the company had too much else to worry about -- the disappointing performance of its America Online division in particular -- to pursue the complicated negotiations.
2/12/2003	Rivals of Microsoft File Antitrust Complaint in Europe	An alliance of technology companies said today that it had filed a new complaint with European antitrust regulators about the Windows XP operating system of Microsoft, just as the regulators were nearing the end of an investigation into earlier versions of Windows. The alliance, called the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said in a news conference today that Microsoft's dominance was stifling innovation and competition in the development of software for all kinds of digital devices, from computers to mobile phones. The alliance includes Sun Microsystems, a longtime foe of Microsoft, as well as companies like Nokia, AOL Time Warner, Eastman Kodak, Fujitsu and Oracle.
2/10/2003	E-Commerce Report; Unscrupulous advertisers are said to outbid reputable merchants for top billings in online searches.	TOP online merchants have advertised extensively on search sites like Google, Yahoo, MSN and AOL, buying their way to prominence. But analysts and executives say that reputable advertisers increasingly find themselves outbid for top search listings by unscrupulous and perhaps fraudulent e-tailers. Executives for the search services say they weed out the bad actors when they are made aware of them, but critics say the search sites are not aggressive enough.
2/10/2003	News Industry Plans for War And Worries About Lost Ads	The last time a president named Bush went to war against Saddam Hussein, in 1991, the confrontation had deep and unforeseen effects across the American media industry. The war established CNN's viability as the first all-news network, taxed television and print news organizations alike with tens of millions in reporting costs, and deprived networks and publications of hundreds of millions in lost revenue as advertisers withdrew from sponsoring the all-consuming news of the conflict. This time, however, the course of the potential conflict is both more open-ended and harder to predict, partly because of the prospect of an uneasy occupation in Iraq and the possibility of terrorist attacks elsewhere. The Pentagon has also given signs that it will allow journalists greater access to the carnage of battle, coverage that could further deter advertisers. Several major media companies, meanwhile, are in a more precarious financial condition than they were a decade ago.
2/5/2003	Turner Confirms Doubt About CNN-ABC Link	Ted Turner, the founder of the Cable News Network, told CBS News yesterday that he opposed a merger of CNN and ABC News, the network said. But executives on both sides of the negotiations said his opposition would make little difference because the merger proposal is dormant if not moribund. Mr. Turner, who announced his resignation last week as vice chairman of CNN's parent, AOL Time Warner, was presumed for some time to be resistant to the merger but had never publicly expressed his opposition.
2/3/2003	Daughter of Welles Seeks 'Kane' Profits	A unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. has been sued by the daughter of Orson Welles, who is seeking profits from her father's 1941 film ''Citizen Kane.'' The daughter, Beatrice Welles, said in a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court here that she owned the rights to the film. She has sued AOL Time Warner and a unit, RKO Pictures Inc.
2/2/2003	Levin on His Exit and His New Life	Gerald M. Levin, in his first on-the-record interview since he left AOL Time Warner, describes the events that led to his departure from the troubled media company. He also discusses his dreams of becoming a social activist and a writer -- goals very different from those he pursued as a hard-charging executive. By Leslie Cauley, Page 6
2/2/2003	AOL's Need: A New Vision	WHEN AOL bought Time Warner two years ago, the company's chairman, Stephen M. Case, told investors he hoped AOL Time Warner would become the most valuable company in the world, surpassing even Microsoft and General Electric. Instead, the next year will determine just how much smaller AOL Time Warner will end up. AOL Time Warner must wriggle out of a financial straitjacket of heavy debt and stagnant profits in part by selling some of its assets. Instead of debating the company's growth potential, investors have begun to ponder what its many marquee businesses, including Warner Brothers and Time Inc., might fetch if the company were broken apart.
2/2/2003	After a Tense Exit, Levin Tells His Side	GERALD M. LEVIN, the former chief executive of AOL Time Warner, is the picture of a man at peace with himself -- finally. Tanned, rested and relaxed, he speaks easily, even joyfully, of his new life. It includes a new address (Marina del Rey), a new vocation (mental health) and a new love (Dr. Laurie Perlman). ''I want to be known as a social activist in education and mental health and, eventually, a writer,'' Mr. Levin said in a recent interview, leaning into his words for emphasis. He intends to accomplish all this, he added, with Dr. Perlman, a clinical psychologist he met last June and whom he intends to marry. Mr. Levin recently asked Barbara Levin, his wife of 32 years, for a divorce, providing fodder for the gossip columns though they had largely been leading separate lives for more than a year.
1/31/2003	One-Two Punch for Investors: AOL and Cable Unit	For many AOL Time Warner investors, the most disconcerting news in the company's gloomy financial report on Wednesday was the disclosure that the problems had spread beyond America Online to Time Warner's cable systems. The company told Wall Street to lower its expectations for growth, warning that the cable systems' advertising revenue was about to take two hits. Other AOL Time Warner units, it said, plan to cut back their advertising on the company's cable systems. And one-time advertising deals with new cable services are drying up.
1/31/2003	AOL Time Warner at Age 2 Seems as Unruly as Ever	In the two years since America Online's ill-fated acquisition of Time Warner, Richard D. Parsons has proved to be a master of the arts of corporate politics and peacemaking. But now he has to work to persuade investors that he is equally suited to lead AOL Time Warner out of the rubble of the merger's aftermath, a task that he said this week could take as long as another full year. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Parsons said he recognized that some shareholders were reserving judgment. ''People have the attitude, 'Show me,' '' Mr. Parsons said. ''That is understandable. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to getting the ball into the end zone.''
1/31/2003	With Ted Turner Afield, Will Vitriol Now Flow?	Ted Turner, the ''mouth from the South,'' has left the building. Now, executives and employees at AOL Time Warner, where Mr. Turner resigned as vice chairman on Wednesday, wonder what he will say next. The mercurial Mr. Turner, the founder of CNN and a significant shareholder in the company, was already a wild card in the corporate chaos at AOL Time Warner. But as soon as Mr. Turner announced his plans to step down and began clearing out his office at CNN Center in Atlanta, longtime colleagues started to predict that he would become a biting critic, going after management when his advice went unheeded.
1/30/2003	Six Finalists Are Named For AOL Ad Account	Six agencies were named yesterday as finalists in a review for the America Online account, with spending estimated at $150 million to $200 million. Ruth Sarfaty, a spokeswoman at America Online in Dulles, Va., part of AOL Time Warner, confirmed reports of the decision in the online editions of Advertising Age and Adweek. She identified the finalists as: BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group; Crispin, Porter & Bogusky in Miami; DDB Worldwide in New York, also part of Omnicom; Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies; Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe; and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore.
1/30/2003	AOL Reporting Further Losses; Turner Resigns	AOL Time Warner reported an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss yesterday as it continued to absorb the disastrous consequences of AOL's acquisition of Time Warner two years ago, and Ted Turner said he would step down as the company's vice chairman. In the darkest indication yet of the lopsided terms of the deal, AOL Time Warner said that it was writing down the value of the AOL division by about $35 billion and its cable division by about $10 billion, for a total of $45 billion. The new write-downs follow a previous $54 billion write-down taken in the first quarter of last year and bring the total reduction in the value of its assets since the merger to nearly $100 billion.
1/27/2003	Editor Leaves AOL For MSNBC.com Job	Dean Wright is returning to MSNBC.com as its top editor, the company announced yesterday. Mr. Wright had been political editor and later managing editor of MSNBC.com before leaving to run AOL Time Warner's effort to build a media Web site around the Netscape browser. Nine months ago, the management of the Web site's parent, MSNBC, the joint venture of Microsoft and NBC, restructured its news management. The site's founding editor, Merrill Brown, left two months later, in June, complaining that the move had lessened his autonomy.
1/23/2003	AOL Is Trying To Find Buyer For Book Unit	AOL Time Warner is seeking to sell its book publishing division in an effort to pay down some of the heavy debt taken on with AOL's acquisition of Time Warner, people involved in sale discussions say. The potential sale puts into question the future control of the fifth-largest consumer book publisher in the United States, with annual revenue of about $320 million in 2001, according to the industry newsletter Subtext. The book division includes Little, Brown & Company and Warner Books. Warner is one of the largest publishers of mass-market paperbacks and in recent decades has become a major publisher of self-help, business and religious books as well as popular novels in hardcover.
1/22/2003	Steve Case's Vision	To the Editor: Re ''Steve Case, Genius,'' by Nina Munk (Op-Ed, Jan. 15): It makes me rather frustrated that we currently live in a world seeking immediate gratification, and when this state does not fulfill our desires, we seek to find blame, point fingers and bring down the ones who were smart enough to have the vision to look ahead to the future in the first place.
1/20/2003	Market Place; A Cast Change at AOL Fails to Draw Applause	For AOL Time Warner investors, last week should have been a big winner. Stephen M. Case, the chairman who was widely blamed for many of the problems at the company's America Online unit, finally resigned. And in a show of corporate stability, the board added the suddenly available chairman's title to that of the chief executive, Richard D. Parsons. But investors are holding their applause. AOL Time Warner stock barely moved, closing on Friday at $14.81, down 7 cents for the week. And it is still far below the $55.77 price where shares traded in late January 2001, just after the merger of AOL and Time Warner was completed.
1/19/2003	A Vertical Neighborhood Takes Shape	AFTER nearly two decades, almost every piece has been assembled to finish the three-dimensional, 2.8-million-square-foot puzzle on Columbus Circle called AOL Time Warner Center. New Yorkers will begin to find out in a few months how the pieces fit. The $1.7 billion project will be the sum of a few contradictory -- or at least incongruous -- parts: a luxury shopping mall anchored by a grocery store, a private enclave that influences the public realm, a place of stratospheric penthouses and a jazz club where musicians will jam until dawn. The mall and a Mandarin Oriental hotel upstairs are to open in September.
1/19/2003	A Star Is Born (If AOL Rebounds)	DON LOGAN, chairman of AOL Time Warner's media and communications group, is often described as an apolitical, unpretentious man with more interest in outwitting fish than corporate foes. Even so, he seems to have an equal affinity for both endeavors. After 10 years of running Time Inc., one of the company's smaller and more stable divisions, Mr. Logan last summer secured one of the top three positions at AOL Time Warner, the world's largest media company.
1/18/2003	VERITAS SOFTWARE RESTATES LOSSES FOR 2000 AND 2001	The Veritas Software Corporation restated its 2000 and 2001 losses to correct how it had accounted for a swap of software and advertising with AOL Time Warner Inc. The 2000 net loss of $620 million widened by $7 million, and a 2001 net loss of $651 million narrowed by $8 million, Veritas said. Sales and profit in the first nine months of 2002 were reduced by less than 1 percent. The company, a maker of data-storage programs, said on Nov. 15 that it had been subpoenaed for a federal inquiry on how an AOL Time Warner unit recorded advertising sales. Federal regulators are examining whether companies including AOL Time Warner and Global Crossing Ltd. improperly bartered services to inflate sales and cash flow.
1/17/2003	AOL's Top Job Goes to Veteran Of Time Warner	Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of AOL Time Warner, was named yesterday to succeed Stephen M. Case as the company's chairman, the culmination of a surprising consolidation of Mr. Parson's power in the two years since AOL acquired Time Warner. Mr. Parsons had been largely shuffled aside in the corporate reorganization after the merger. He was perceived as playing second fiddle to his charismatic co-chief operating officer, Robert W. Pittman. Mr. Parsons, then president of Time Warner, watched, often silently, from the sidelines when the merger was negotiated and crucial decisions were made in the first year after its completion.
1/16/2003	Parsons Seen Topping List To Be New AOL Chairman	As the directors of AOL Time Warner prepare for the full meeting of the company's board today, Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive, is emerging as the most likely successor to the chairman, Stephen M. Case, who is stepping down in May. Several people close to the board said the final decision would depend mainly on the wishes of Mr. Parsons himself, who they said would keep his chief executive duties.
1/15/2003	Public Offering Of Cable Unit Is Vital to AOL	For most of the last year, the biggest battles over AOL Time Warner's future have been fought in its boardroom and executive suites. Now the company faces a potentially more significant turning point -- the planned sale of shares in its cable division. AOL Time Warner hopes that a successful public offering would permit it to expand its cable holdings, which could re-shape both the company and, ultimately, the television business. But if the prospective offering is postponed or disappointing, AOL Time Warner could face an onerous cash squeeze and its chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, could suffer a serious blow to his credibility.
1/15/2003	THE MARKETS: Market Place; The offering of Time Warner Cable has bankers salivating.	IT may not be the deal of the century, but the planned stock offering in Time Warner Cable has investment and commercial bankers scrambling for business in what is an otherwise arid market. In March, AOL Time Warner plans to sell a portion of its majority stake in its cable company to the public in what will probably be the biggest equity deal of the year.
1/15/2003	Steve Case, Genius	The morning after announcing he would resign as chairman of AOL Time Warner, Steve Case was asked to feel his shareholders' pain. ''In a personal sense, how badly do you feel about the almost $200 billion worth of shareholder value that has been wiped out?'' asked an interviewer on CNN. Not too bad, apparently. His face expressionless, Mr. Case said: ''I recognize a lot of people have bet on this company and are disappointed by the results. But it's never over till it's over.'' With that platitude, Mr. Case exhibited what many see as his two great character flaws: a lack of empathy and a refusal to accept blame. But perhaps more revealing than his answer was the question. AOL Time Warner shareholders shouldn't be looking for an apology from Steve Case. He played the game brilliantly.
1/14/2003	Tarnished Vision	AOL Time Warner, the world's largest media company, stands today as a casualty of the salesmanship of Stephen M. Case and the credulousness of the Time Warner executives who bought into his sparkling vision of synergies between the old media and the new. Now, Mr. Case has resigned as the company's chairman, the vision has dimmed and executives from the Time Warner side of the combined business -- filled with remorse if not resentment at having sold to Mr. Case's America Online at the height of the Internet mania -- face the task alone of resuscitating the company.
1/14/2003	Question of New Chairman At Top of Board's Agenda	If not for an accident of timing, Richard D. Parsons might be the chief executive of the cigarette company Philip Morris. A year ago, he was close to accepting a contract to take the job when AOL Time Warner, where he was co-chief operating officer, asked him to succeed the chief executive, Gerald M. Levin, who was resigning. A tumultuous year later, the resignation of AOL Time Warner's chairman, Stephen M. Case, has left Mr. Parsons as the last of the original AOL Time Warner management still standing and a possible candidate for the chairmanship itself. A lawyer whose first love was politics, he has demonstrated a deft hand for managing the company's feuding constituencies in the last year -- and keeping himself on top. But some major shareholders have begun to wonder whether, beyond the next few years, Mr. Parsons has enough passion or even affinity for media and entertainment to steer the largest communications company in the world.
1/14/2003	Resignation May Help Ground a Visionary Medium	Anyone checking e-mail on AOL these days will probably be confronted with multiple entreaties to try the company's broadband service, the keystone of America Online's new determination to charge a premium for online information and entertainment. If there is symbolic meaning to Stephen M. Case's decision to step down as chairman of the world's largest media company this week, it may lie in the message underscored by the insistent marketing: it is time for the online service to start pulling its own weight.
1/14/2003	Poor Mr. Case? Financially, Think Again	Stephen M. Case may be out of work, but he is unlikely to run out of money. Long before announcing on Sunday that he would step down as chairman of AOL Time Warner, Mr. Case had liquidated some of his holdings.
1/14/2003	Which Would Have Done Better Without the Merger?	Just three years ago, when the merger of Time Warner and AOL was announced, shareholders of the former leaped for joy, and those of the latter were stunned and disappointed. Sometimes, shareholders can be very wrong.
1/14/2003	Corporate Donation Buoys Home For Jazz	Against a backdrop of generally shrinking donations to arts groups, the Coca-Cola Company has agreed to give $10 million toward completion of Jazz at Lincoln Center's new home on Columbus Circle. The gift is crucial to the $128 million project, which will be a centerpiece of the new AOL Time Warner headquarters building, because the project is facing higher construction costs and the withdrawal of several pledges that were made in flusher economic times. In return for the $10 million commitment, which leaves the project $32 million short of its goal, Jazz at Lincoln Center will name one of its three performance venues, a 140-seat club-like space, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola.
1/14/2003	The Price Wasn't Right	Steve Case's departure as chairman of AOL Time Warner all but completes the topsy-turvy transformation of the media conglomerate's executive suite since the merger turned sour. Mr. Case's role in this affair will be debated for years, but for now Richard Parsons and the other old-media executives who are back in charge of AOL Time Warner face the difficult job of managing their crazy-quilt company and devising a workable business strategy for their ailing Internet service. It's easy to forget that three years ago when the AOL takeover of Time Warner was announced, Mr. Case, the man from the new economy, wore a tie, and Gerald Levin, the old-economy warhorse, did not. Each man, it was said, was trying hard to fit in with the other's corporate culture.
1/13/2003	Time Inc. May Start a New Home Magazine	Time Inc., which has been quiet on the new-magazine front during the industry's economic downturn, has approved the initial development of a home magazine tentatively called Haven. Conceived as a home and lifestyle magazine for women of means, a ''very rough'' prototype of Haven has been created, according to two executives at the company, a unit of AOL Time Warner.
1/13/2003	Reviews Begin On 2 Big Accounts	Two big advertisers, America Online and Nextel Communications, have started reviews on their accounts, with combined billings estimated at $300 million to $400 million. America Online in Dulles, Va., part of AOL Time Warner, began its review Friday by dismissing its agency, Gotham in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. America Online spends an estimated $150 million to $200 million annually on advertising; its total yearly marketing budget is estimated at $1 billion.
1/13/2003	AOL Chairman Quits His Post Amid Criticism	Stephen M. Case, the former chief executive of America Online who engineered its acquisition of Time Warner, resigned last night as chairman of the combined company, AOL Time Warner, bowing to shareholder anger over the dismal results of the merger. He will remain as a board member. Mr. Case's sudden resignation is the culmination of an 18-year rise on the crest of the Internet boom, which took him from founding an obscure start-up betting on the future of an unknown medium to becoming the top executive of the world's largest media company. Now, he becomes the latest media empire builder to resign from the helm of a communications conglomerate in the boom's aftermath, following the departures of Jean-Marie Messier from the chairmanship of Vivendi Universal and Thomas Middelhoff from the top job at Bertelsmann.
1/9/2003	An Internet Official Agrees To Plead Guilty to Fraud	A fourth executive of the Internet real estate company Homestore agreed yesterday to plead guilty to securities fraud. He also agreed to assist investigations into Homestore's accounting and its deals with AOL Time Warner and other companies, people involved in the inquiry said.
1/6/2003	Seeking Market Clarity	The battle among the top Web search sites for the United States audience has grown fiercer, and more complex, with the recent announcement that Yahoo plans to buy Inktomi, a Web search technology company, for $235 million in cash. One of Yahoo's main competitors is Google, which besides operating its own popular search site, competes with Inktomi in offering search technology to other companies. Inktomi's clients include MSN.com, Overture, About.com and Looksmart. Among Google's clients are AOL Properties, Ask Jeeves, Netscape and here is where things get interesting Yahoo itself. Both Inktomi and Google, meanwhile, do business with HotBot, the search service owned by Lycos.
1/6/2003	AOL Unit's Chief Navigates Churning Corporate Rapids	In his first five months as chairman of the struggling AOL division of AOL Time Warner, Jonathan Miller has played a role something like that of a precocious child trying to salvage his parents' strained marriage. Just down the hall from his office sits the company's chairman, Stephen M. Case, founder of AOL and architect of its acquisition of Time Warner. Mr. Case loves nothing more than deep debates about the future of technology and media, and he has actively watched Mr. Miller's progress.
12/29/2002	Coming Up Roses In a Downcast Year	THE year 2002 will surely go down as one of the worst in business history. Scandal rocked corporate suites and Washington offices, jobs evaporated, the American economy muddled along and Europe and Latin America reeled. Rogues at companies like WorldCom and Enron were bad enough, but even superstar executives like Jack Welch contributed to the staining of corporate America.
12/23/2002	An Eccentric in Residence Aims for Harmony at Time	In a dark, mysterious place where kingdoms collide, a tiny figure possesses a prized power, one that could help bring peace and prosperity to warring corporate forces. Mark Golin, the creative director at AOL who is on loan to Time Inc., occupies a middle earth between the antagonistic divisions of a media giant that has stumbled badly since the AOL Time Warner merger nearly two years ago. Partial to wearing a long leather coat and green shoes, he eerily resembles a punk version of the hobbit Frodo in ''The Lord of the Rings.'' And his quest is no less arduous.
12/23/2002	Warner Home Video's Chief Leaves His Job Unexpectedly	Warren Lieberfarb, a Hollywood executive often credited with jump-starting the market for DVD's, has abruptly left his job as president of Warner Home Video at the Warner Brothers division of AOL Time Warner. Mr. Lieberfarb is leaving on the heels of crucial victories in a contentious, decade-long effort to promote the sales of DVD's over the rental of videocassettes and to advance video-on-demand sales of films through cable television systems.
12/20/2002	Interpublic Promotes From McCann-Erickson	Lori Senecal, executive vice president and director for account management at McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, was promoted to global director for Coca-Cola brands at the parent company, the Interpublic Group of Companies. Ms. Senecal, 37, succeeds William B. Grogan Jr., 42, who was named senior vice president for marketing at the global marketing solutions division of AOL Time Warner in New York.
12/16/2002	A 'New Economy' Editor at Time to Oversee AOL Integration	Time Inc. is expected to announce today that Ned Desmond, currently president of the company's Business 2.0 magazine, has been chosen to oversee the integration of Time Inc. content into the AOL service, according to company executives. As executive editor of Time Inc. Interactive, a new job, Mr. Desmond will move to the AOL unit's headquarters in Dulles, Va., where he will work closely with the online service's programming executives.
12/11/2002	AOL Is Moving Music Unit	AOL Time Warner's WEA Corporation unit, the distribution division of the company's Warner Music Group, will close some branch offices and move its headquarters to New York from Burbank, Calif. The company will be reorganized into four regional offices, in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and New York, instead of the current 10 offices, the Warner Music Group said.
12/9/2002	Free Content On the Web? Publishers Are Divided	Is the era of free information and entertainment on the Internet over? That was one of the more provocative assumptions put forward by the new management of America Online in its presentation to analysts last week.
12/5/2002	New Strategy From AOL Leaves Many Unconvinced	For all the talk Tuesday of a new, humbled, content-driven America Online, the core of its strategy remains largely unchanged -- that it can justify a premium price by appealing to families that go online mainly to communicate with one another. And since that strategy led to the company's current stagnation, investors and analysts walked away from AOL Time Warner's four-hour meeting unconvinced that AOL's product plans were strong enough to reignite its growth anytime soon.
12/4/2002	Competition Forces AOL To Emphasize Faster Links	AOL Time Warner yesterday presented a new strategy for its AOL division to compete for high-speed Internet users, acknowledging that the service that helped make the Internet a mass medium is now in danger of falling behind as consumers seek faster connections online. AOL Time Warner said AOL was redirecting its efforts toward marketing an upgraded version of its high-speed service intended to take advantage of the elaborate multimedia potential of high-speed Internet connections, partly by offering music and videos from its sister companies. AOL said it would seek to persuade high-speed users to pay an additional monthly fee of about $15 for its service even after buying broadband access from another company for as much as $50 a month.
12/4/2002	Online Survivor: A Parent Comes to the Aid of Its Wayward Child	Since AOL and Time Warner merged nearly two years ago, the various divisions of the company have often behaved less like parts of a unified media conglomerate than alley cats confined to a small space. But yesterday, when it was announced that divisions including Time Inc., Turner Broadcasting, HBO and Warner Brothers would all be making significant content contributions to AOL's proprietary service, there were expressions of solidarity and support. The shift from in-fighting to cooperation is considered genuine and stems from a basic survival instinct at a company that has seen much of its value disappear, according to company executives. Improving AOL Time Warner's fortunes -- and stock price -- hinges largely on a turnaround at the AOL division. And the executives urging the divisions to play nice have more credibility than their predecessors.
12/3/2002	AOL Is Expected To Announce Big Policy Shift	In a pivotal and long-awaited presentation to investors, AOL Time Warner is expected to disclose a radical shift in strategy for its flagging AOL division today, switching the emphasis away from selling Internet access and toward selling an add-on high-speed version of its service to customers who may buy high-speed Internet access from phone or cable companies. Jonathan Miller, the recently named chairman of the AOL division, will disclose the latest plans to turn around AOL in a four-hour briefing with investors in New York. After growing exponentially until last year, AOL is suffering from steeply declining advertising revenue, slowing subscriber growth, rising costs to reach customers over high-speed cable or other connections, and stiff competition from cheaper high-speed services.
12/2/2002	Offers for AOL Online Unit Were Rejected	Several Wall Street buyout firms approached AOL Time Warner earlier this year about the possibility of acquiring its flagship online unit but were rebuffed, according to executives close to the discussions. The overtures, by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Blackstone Group and several others during the summer, are a tacit example of the prevailing notion on Wall Street about AOL's need to raise cash.
12/2/2002	AOL Chairman Fights Back As Problems Surround Him	Stephen M. Case, chairman of AOL Time Warner, has no shortage of detractors. Once praised as a visionary for building the AOL Internet service, he now faces a chorus of angry shareholders bitter about the abrupt downturn in AOL's performance, directors who want him to resign, company executives who doubt his authority and federal regulators investigating AOL's accounting. Under the circumstances, other executives might be tempted to bow out, or at least stay out of the limelight, but not Mr. Case. Against the advice of some associates, he has gone on the offensive, seeking to win back shareholders' support. Tomorrow, he will take the stage for a cameo appearance when Jonathan Miller, the new chairman of the AOL division, lays out a turnaround plan for the AOL service at a presentation in New York, people involved in the agenda said.
11/25/2002	S.E.C. Inquiry On Homestore Has Expanded To Cendant	Securities regulators are investigating the real estate and travel company Cendant's dealings with the online real estate company Homestore.com, people involved in the investigation said late last week. The inquiry into Cendant's role indicates the increasingly broad scope of an investigation that began about a year ago into Homestore, a start-up based in Westlake Village, Calif., that has acknowledged overstating revenue in the first nine months of last year by more than 30 percent.
11/20/2002	AOL Chairman to Present New Initiatives	The short-term future of America Online appears to be full of trailers -- short samples of new films, television shows, music videos and albums, video games and even car commercials that members can download and take in on their computer screens. Over the last few weeks, AOL has quietly begun providing its members who have high-speed connections a growing variety of audiovisual clips: a scene from NBC's hit television show ''Friends'' before it appeared last Thursday, a few minutes from an ABC News interview with the former butler of Princess Diana, snippets of a coming Oprah Winfrey show and shots of expensive cars.
11/16/2002	New Charges Against AOL Made in Suit On Homestore	A complaint filed yesterday in a suit by a large shareholder against the online real estate company Homestore.com makes new accusations of financial fraud at AOL Time Warner, including detailed descriptions of conversations between senior executives who, it says, were planning to inflate revenue improperly at both companies. Federal prosecutors and securities regulators are already investigating possible financial improprieties at both Homestore and AOL Time Warner. The complaint sheds new light on the progress of the investigations because it draws on some of the information that federal prosecutors have gathered.
11/14/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: 2 Music Services Win Catalog Rights	The dueling online music services owned by separate coalitions of the five major record companies are set to announce that they have each acquired the rights to distribute the digital catalogs of all five. The long-anticipated deals mean that the services will finally be able to offer the breadth of selection that Napster did before being shut down by a court order, except that consumers will have to pay for the music. Pressplay, whose parents are Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group , has signed a deal with Warner Music Group (part of AOL Time Warner). MusicNet, owned by Warner Music Group, EMI Group and BMG (part of Bertelsmann), is expected to announce within a few days that it has the rights to the catalogs of Sony and Universal. Amy Harmon (NYT)
11/13/2002	New Top-Level Change at AOL May Foreshadow Fresh Content	James de Castro resigned yesterday as president of America Online's flagship interactive service and was replaced by its vice chairman, Ted Leonsis, signaling an intention to resurrect Mr. Leonsis's long-held vision of the service as a medium for presenting original programming. The departure of Mr. de Castro after just seven months on the job and the appointment of Mr. Leonsis come just three weeks before the date set by the division's parent company, AOL Time Warner, for unfolding a new business plan, intended to attract more high-speed broadband users and replace its declining sales of advertising and marketing packages. The company is enforcing a public silence about the details of its plans until then, creating a steadily increasing drumbeat of anticipation and pressure from Wall Street.
11/11/2002	A Test of Synergy; A Film May Not Need a Media Conglomerate To Ensure the Widest Exposure	One wears an Omega watch, shaves with a Norelco razor, drives an Aston Martin, and drinks martinis with Finlandia vodka -- shaken, not stirred. The other eats Bertie Botts Every-Flavor Beans, flies a Nimbus 2000, favors butter beer and endorses Coca-Cola. In the next two weeks, James Bond and Harry Potter will be commandeering movie screens around the country, heralded by a barrage of marketing tie-ins, television commercials, cable specials, magazine covers and Web sites. But the companies pulling the strings behind the two promotional juggernauts stand at the extremes of the entertainment industry.
11/11/2002	CNN's Parent May Postpone News Merger With ABC	Negotiators of the proposed merger between CNN and ABC News reported extensive progress late last week and predicted that an agreement in principle could be in place as early as January. But as the negotiators pushed ahead, new questions arose over whether the leadership of CNN's parent, AOL Time Warner, would delay any deal as it coped with other issues roiling the company. AOL Time Warner has been buffeted by a series of crises in the past year, including management changes, and it is now facing a federal investigation into its accounting. Some executives at the two companies said AOL Time Warner could put off finalizing the merger, possibly for many months, to deal with what the board considers more pressing priorities.
11/5/2002	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: AOL Instant-Message Service For Businesses	AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online unit will sell a version of its instant-messaging service to businesses as the unit, the largest Internet access provider, tries to find more corporate customers. Starting yesterday, America Online will charge an undisclosed amount for each user of the enterprise edition of AOL Instant Messenger, a senior vice president, Bruce Stewart, said. Downloading the consumer version remains free. The business version has more security features, he said.
11/1/2002	The Pinch of Piracy Wakes China Up On Copyright Issue; It's More Than a Trade Dispute When the Victims Are Chinese	When the members of the preview audience showed up at China's fanciest new movie theater here this week, they were treated to much more than just the first look at Zhang Yimou's big-budget martial-arts film, ''Hero.'' Viewers had identity card numbers inscribed on their tickets. They were videotaped as they entered the theater's foyer. They handed over all cellphones, watches, lighters, car keys, necklaces and pens and put them in storage. Before taking their seats, they passed through a metal detector. Then they got a welcoming address.
10/29/2002	Aegis Reports Gains From Broadcast Ads	The Aegis Group in London said it was reaping the benefits of ''further clear improvements'' in broadcast advertising in the United States since the first half of the year and that it expected results for the year before one-time costs to be ''significantly better'' than in 2001. The statement from Aegis contrasts with last week's announcement by the WPP Group in London that its revenue was falling largely because of the poor economy in North America.
10/28/2002	A TV House Divided; A Debate on Skipping Ads at AOL Time Warner	The future of television has finally arrived -- really. Now begins the haggling over who gets control, and negotiations with the highest stakes are taking place inside AOL Time Warner. Under fierce competition from satellite services, the Time Warner cable division is racing to sell new features that give viewers more control over what and when they watch. Its new digital services can let subscribers order any of an array of films and network programs whenever they want and even turn set-top boxes into personal digital video recorders that make it easy for viewers to fast-forward through commercials.
10/25/2002	Disney to Offer New Internet Access Service	The Walt Disney Company will introduce a new dial-up Internet access service aimed at families with children that is a customized version of Microsoft's MSN. Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chief executive, announced the new service in a surprise appearance on a stage set up by Microsoft in Central Park yesterday to start a $300 million marketing blitz for the next version of MSN. Microsoft is taking aim at AOL Time Warner's America Online service, and an association with Mickey Mouse, the Lion King and Winnie the Pooh is meant to appeal to AOL's mainstream audience.
10/24/2002	AOL and MSN: Two Paths to Milestone 8	YOU can always count on certain reassuring harbingers of autumn: the leaves change, the air becomes cool and crisp, and new versions of America Online and MSN appear. This year the hype machine went into hyperdrive. Starting today, Microsoft will be plastering every available surface in a $300 million advertising campaign for MSN 8, its Internet service. AOL will spend about $100 million to hawk its own Version 8.0. Both companies rented famous places in New York -- and famous entertainers -- for extravagant ''launch events'' this month.
10/24/2002	AOL to Restate Troubled Unit's Revenue Again, Vexing Wall St.	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it had turned up several additional improper transactions at its AOL division, broadening the extent of its acknowledged accounting problems and restating its reported revenue down by $190 million over a two-year period that ended this summer. The company said the restatement lowered its revenue by 1 percent over the two years, reducing the AOL division's reported cash flow, or earnings before certain charges, by $97 million, or 1.9 percent. Investors initially reacted with a combination of relief to the limited size of the restatement and satisfaction at strong third-quarter results from AOL Time Warner's other divisions. In after-hours trading, shares of AOL Time Warner rose about 5 percent.
10/23/2002	AOL Said to Be Extending Its Inquiry on Revenue Data	Three months ago, AOL Time Warner started an internal investigation into $49 million in questionable revenue at its AOL division, saying it hoped to resolve the matter by the end of the quarter. Investors will have to keep waiting. When AOL Time Warner reports its third-quarter results today, executives plan to leave open the possibility that its internal investigation will continue indefinitely, people briefed on its intentions said.
10/18/2002	Movie Service Closes in Studio Dispute	Intertainer, a Los Angeles company that distributes movies over the Internet and cable television networks, said yesterday that it would close its service, citing licensing practices by the major movie studios that it said were unfair. Intertainer filed a lawsuit in a federal court in California last month charging AOL Time Warner, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Universal Studios with antitrust violations.
10/16/2002	AOL Says It Will Eliminate Some of Its Pop-Up Ads	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that its AOL service would eliminate pop-up advertisements for other companies as it sought to revive the allegiance of its members, reinvent its fading advertising business, and fend off an assault from Microsoft's MSN service. An AOL spokesman said the policy would end more than half of its pop-up ads, including those for sales of merchandise. The company will continue running those advertisements until it fulfills certain contractual commitments. AOL will also still run some pop-up advertisements for its own services and features, although a spokesman said it would run fewer of those as well.
10/14/2002	The Outer Limits of Optimism; How AOL's Sunny Forecasts Outshined the Gloomy Facts	Six months after America Online bought Time Warner, the merged company's top executives rejected arguments from its chief financial officer that they should back down from their ambitious promises to Wall Street, three senior executives involved in the company's deliberations now say. Instead, the executives waited two more months, until September 2001, to publicly acknowledge that the company would badly miss their financial projections made at the time of the merger.
10/8/2002	AOL Latin America To Convert Stock	AOL Latin America said today that its two largest shareholders would convert their preferred shares into common stock as the Internet service struggles to keep enough equity in the open market. The company said the two shareholders, AOL Time Warner and the Cisneros Group, had presented a plan to the Nasdaq listing qualifications panel to convert a ''significant number of preferred stock'' to common shares to exceed the $35 million needed for AOL Latin America to continue trading on the Nasdaq small-capitalization Market.
10/8/2002	Two Magazines Are Shut And Red Herring Is Sold	Mutual Funds magazine, a personal finance magazine owned by AOL Time Warner, and Upside magazine, a privately held publication in Silicon Valley, announced yesterday that they were shutting down. And Red Herring, another Silicon Valley publication, announced that it was selling itself to a majority investor in an effort to restructure financially. The November issue of Mutual Funds, which is on newsstands now, will be the last, while the October issue of Upside, which was in production, will not be published.
10/7/2002	Compressed Data; Dueling 8.0's: America Online vs. Microsoft	So let's see who has the most star power -- Alanis Morissette or Bill Gates. Next week in Manhattan, on Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Morissette is among those who will help Stephen M. Case, chairman of AOL Time Warner, celebrate the rollout of version 8.0 of America Online's software with a show at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. (Ms. Morissette, not coincidentally, is a pop artist for AOL's corporate cousin, Warner Music.) The audience will include about 2,000 AOL subscribers, some of whom will be asked to speak about why they still love the service's online community.
10/2/2002	Market Place; AOL's chairman takes a few moments to define his role and to calm jittery investors.	STEPHEN M. CASE, the chairman of AOL Time Warner, under fire from some directors and major shareholders over the disappointing performance of its AOL division, yesterday laid out his continuing contributions as the leader of its board and an adviser to its management. At a Goldman, Sachs investors conference in New York, Mr. Case did not comment on reports of a possible challenge to his job from other directors. But he spoke publicly about his role at the company for the first time since July, when the poor current performance of the AOL division and accusations of potentially overstated revenue began to arouse shareholder ire at his part in AOL's acquisition of Time Warner.
9/27/2002	From 'Piranha' At Homestore To Key Role In U.S. Inquiry	Peter Tafeen, the former deal maker for Homestore.com and now a central figure in investigations of accounting at AOL Time Warner, sometimes boasted that his ruthless approach to business earned him the nickname ''the Piranha.'' In late spring of 2000, for example, he handed executives of the Internet start-up ServiceLane.com a list of terms for a proposed deal under the headline Project Hammer, telling them that their company could not survive without Homestore, ServiceLane's chief executive, Lee Blaylock, recalled yesterday.
9/26/2002	U.S. Focuses On Executive At Homestore	Federal investigators examining possible accounting fraud at the online retailer Homestore.com and AOL Time Warner are now turning their attention to Peter Tafeen, a Homestore executive who worked closely with counterparts at AOL to devise complicated deals between the companies, people involved in the inquiries said. Yesterday, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission said that three former Homestore executives had agreed to plead guilty to charges related to securities fraud and cooperate with the investigations. A copy of the complaint against the three executives charged that the crimes of the Homestore executives included arranging fraudulent ''round trip'' transactions to inflate revenue by funneling the company's money back to itself through ''a major media company.''
9/25/2002	AOL Time Warner and Disney Revive Talks on News Venture	Trying to conserve cash, AOL Time Warner and the Walt Disney Corporation have revived long-running talks about combining their CNN and ABC News operations into a joint venture in an effort to cut costs, people involved in the talks said yesterday. Both companies are more motivated to reach an agreement than ever because they are suffering through a prolonged downturn in advertising sales while under pressure from investors and credit-rating agencies to pay down their debts. The discussions also take place at a time when the top executives of both AOL Time Warner and Disney are under particular pressure from shareholders and directors to improve their results.
9/25/2002	Guilty Pleas Are Expected At Homestore	Three executives of the online real estate company Homestore.com have agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud and to cooperate with an investigation into Homestore.com and a related inquiry into AOL Time Warner, one of its business partners, two people involved in the investigations said yesterday. The agreements are expected to be announced today by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
9/24/2002	Former Chief of Time Warner Defends Sale to America Online	Gerald M. Levin, the former chief executive of Time Warner who agreed to sell the company to AOL, publicly defended his decision for the first time since he retired last spring amid mounting disappointment with the deal. It is too early to judge the merits of the merger, Mr. Levin told Reuters yesterday, while appearing in London at the World Congress of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers.
9/20/2002	No Moves by AOL Board on Its Chairman	The position of Stephen M. Case, whose continuation as chairman of AOL Time Warner has met opposition from some major shareholders and directors, was not discussed at the board meeting yesterday, a company spokesman said. ''As we have repeatedly said, Steve Case is the company's chairman, and he will remain so,'' the spokesman, Edward Adler, said.
9/19/2002	AOL Chairman Expected to Survive Challenge	Standing his ground against the opposition of some major shareholders and several directors, Stephen M. Case is expected to keep his job as chairman of AOL Time Warner at the company's board meeting today in New York, several people close to the board said yesterday. Mr. Case is determined to fight back against his critics, people close to him said, setting up a contest for the support of the shareholders and the board over the next several months and possibly culminating at AOL Time Warner's annual meeting in the spring.
9/17/2002	Some Directors Said to Seek Ouster at AOL	Several directors of AOL Time Warner are seeking to oust the company's chairman, Stephen M. Case, and he is resisting their challenge, according to three people close to the board. The directors may seek Mr. Case's removal as early as a board meeting in New York on Thursday. But Mr. Case wants to remain chairman, AOL Time Warner executives close to him said, and he will probably have enough support to forestall an open challenge at the meeting. Shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on his position at the company's annual meeting in the spring.
9/16/2002	Cablevision's TV Systems Could Go On the Block	Will Chuck Dolan, one of cable television's last reigning patriarchs, finally cash out? After years of fiercely defending his company's independence, Charles F. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision -- the nation's seventh-largest cable operator and owner of diverse sports and entertainment interests -- said last week that he was open to selling the company's crown jewel: its cable television systems, which serve three million subscribers in the New York area.
9/16/2002	New Approach for AOL Broadband Unit	When Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of AOL Time Warner, talks about the company's prospects for its high-speed Internet service, he suggests simply that the company has to treat America Online like its pay cable network, HBO. It is meant to reassure investors, who have seen AOL Time Warner transform HBO from a package of second-run movies to some of the hottest original programming on television. He implies that any company that could come up with ''Sex and the City'' and ''The Sopranos'' will be able to invent something equally compelling to persuade people to buy America Online's high-speed broadband service.
9/15/2002	Analyze This: What Those Analysts Said in Private	JUST when you thought their reputations could sink no lower, perfidious stock analysts roared back into the news last week. That's the trouble with these long-running corporate scandals: no matter how heartily investors long for good news, the bad just keeps on coming. First we learned of the Merrill Lynch analyst who was bullish on Tyco International stock and exchanged gifts of expensive wine with L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief. This mutual admiration society emerged last week when Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, brought a new indictment against Mr. Kozlowski, whose greed apparently knew no bounds.
9/14/2002	AOL TIME WARNER NAMES HEAD OF MARKETING ARM	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it had hired Michael Kelly, a former Time Inc. executive, to run a marketing group created a year ago to increase advertising sales in all of the company's units. Mr. Kelly spent 17 years at Time Inc., where he was Entertainment Weekly's publisher from 1996 to 2000, before founding American Town Network, an online guide to suburban communities. America Online, the world's largest provider of Internet access, has reported three quarters of declining ad sales, and government regulators are investigating marketing deals in the unit.
9/13/2002	America Online Is Making More Changes at the Top	AOL Time Warner reshuffled the management of its America Online division yesterday, aiming to move beyond the unit's recent accounting problems and begin developing new, more elaborate interactive programming. The changes were the first major move by Jonathan F. Miller, America Online's new chairman and chief executive. Mr. Miller, America Online's third chief executive in a year, arrived last month during a period of turmoil at the division. Its advertising revenue has fallen sharply and the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an investigation into its accounting.
9/11/2002	Many Chiefs Are Retaining Extra Benefits In Retirement	Often described as a model for chief executives, John F. Welch Jr. appears to have also created the model employment contract. The contract that Mr. Welch signed in 1996 as chief executive of General Electric was full of benefits that continue to flow to him in retirement. It quickly became a template for other executives to use to negotiate their own contracts, people in the field of executive pay say.
9/10/2002	AOL Expects Internet Ads To Be Weak	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that advertising on its flagship online service this year will be 6 percent lower than its previous forecast, a drop of $100 million. As a result the unit's pretax operating profit will also be $100 million below its expectations. But the media conglomerate said that its other businesses were performing modestly better than expected and that it would meet its current profit and revenue targets for the rest of the year. Some investors saw the announcement as a sign that problems continue at the company, which has repeatedly had to pull back from optimistic forecasts for its America Online unit.
9/9/2002	Short of Cash, Media Giants Are Selling Assets	There is a sale on in the media business but hardly anyone is buying. A 20-year acquisition spree that turned the major communications companies into behemoths is shifting into reverse as many of them find themselves short of cash and looking to sell, leaving few to bid.
9/6/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: AOL To Use Covad High-Speed Network	Covad Communications said yesterday that AOL Time Warner would use Covad's network to provide high-speed Web connections to America Online customers. The five-year agreement gives AOL Time Warner, based in New York, access to a network covering 40 million homes and businesses in the United States, Covad said in a statement. Shares of Covad, which emerged from bankruptcy in December, rose as much as 29 percent, before ending the day at $1.32, up 18 cents, or 15.8 percent. As the number of new consumers using dial-up Internet access slows, AOL Time Warner is trying to add customers through agreements with companies like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which have regional high-speed networks. Covad sells high-speed links to the Internet through digital subscriber lines. AOL Time Warner will pay Covad an undisclosed amount a month for each subscriber. A Covad spokeswoman, Martha Sessums, declined to give the amount. An AOL Time Warner spokesman, Ed Adler, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
9/2/2002	AOL Reaches to Create Its Own Big Music Scene on the Internet	''Start over, and keep it clean this time,'' the voice booms from the control room of an East Village sound studio. Without losing stride, Ludacris, the sassy and sexy best-selling young rap star, and his new group, Disturbing Tha Peace, begin their song, ''Posted,'' from the top, this time slurring through some of the saltier verses.
9/1/2002	Ouster at AOL, but Where Does Trail End?	BEFORE he came to America Online in 1995, David M. Colburn was a corporate lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., known for his meticulousness, his aggression and his eccentricity. Commuting from Los Angeles, he shaved once a week, drove a beat-up clunker and slept in a cheap motel. In an office of suits and khakis, he customarily wore cowboy boots with pinstripe suit pants, polo shirts and an earring. He became notorious for screaming and swearing at younger lawyers for offenses like the failure to underline the phrase ''provided, however'' while preparing a contract, lawyers who worked with him said. The same no-holds-barred approach to business helped propel Mr. Colburn's rise at AOL, where he became the chief deal maker, in charge of its business affairs department. It may also have led to his disgrace. Three weeks ago, he was ousted after federal investigators and an internal inquiry by lawyers for AOL Time Warner began looking into the possibility that deals he negotiated may have inappropriately inflated the company's revenue.
8/28/2002	Many Marketers Will Forgo Ads During Sept. 11	Two weeks before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a consensus seems to be emerging about advertising on that day: less will be more. Most marketers, agencies and media companies are deciding that they would rather go adless or limit their advertising than risk being perceived as exploiting the day for mercenary purposes.
8/26/2002	New Economy; A New Model For AOL May Influence Cable's Future	The top executives at AOL Time Warner and Comcast probably did not feel like heavyweight boxers as they hammered out last week's deal for the looming AT&T Comcast cable television giant to distribute the America Online Internet service. And yet, the agreement may represent a technological transition point in the cable TV business as important as the ''Thrilla' in Manila'' heavyweight title fight in the Philippines 27 years ago. Internet technology could now create the same kind of era-defining shift in cable television that satellites did back then. And for the media industry, the big question is which sorts of companies can benefit most from this transition -- the companies that operate the cable systems, or the ones that provide the ''content.''
8/26/2002	Plunge in Bison and AOL Weighs on Turner Fortune	Ted Turner, apparently, is not a happy camper. Or a jolly rancher. That is because it is has been a bad year to own stock in AOL Time Warner and livestock in the form of bison. And Mr. Turner, the 63-year-old vice chairman of AOL Time Warner, owns a lot of both.
8/26/2002	From Unseemly to Lowbrow, the Web's Real Money Is in the Gutter	Life is good at the bottom of the cyberspace pit. When the Arizona attorney general's office recently shut down a Scottsdale company, CP Direct, it offered a glimpse into the spoils of the Internet's dark side. The company sold pills via the Web that promised to increase penis length, bust size and body height. Enough people had spent $60 an order -- mostly for the ''Longitude'' treatments, with ingredients that included pumpkin seed, sarsaparilla and ''oyster meat'' -- that the state was able to seize more than $30 million in luxury real estate and a herd of Mercedes-Benzes, Rolls Royces and a Lamborghini.
8/23/2002	AOL's Swap Deals With 2 Others Said to Be a Focus of the S.E.C.	The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into AOL Time Warner's complex swapping transactions with Qwest Communications International and WorldCom, people involved in the investigation said yesterday. A spokesman for AOL Time Warner declined to comment on specific deals with the two companies. AOL Time Warner, Qwest and WorldCom are all under separate investigations by the S.E.C.
8/22/2002	AOL Revives Focus on Creating Original Content	The executives assuming control of the struggling America Online Internet service are reviving a strategy the company abandoned five years ago, emphasizing the creation of original, exclusive content, said people who have discussed the matter with AOL's new chairman, Jonathan F. Miller. AOL hopes to use the content -- from text-only chats with celebrities to more elaborate videos of movie trailers and vacation spots -- partly to sell goods and services directly to its subscribers.
8/22/2002	Market Place; All Sides Praise Deal Dissolving Time Warner Entertainment	By the time the lawyers and bankers had finished the plan to dissolve Time Warner Entertainment early yesterday, each of the three companies in the deal had something to crow about. But it was Comcast that had cause to crow loudest. The deal would clear one of the last potential roadblocks to the Comcast Corporation's plan to acquire AT&T's cable unit, by removing a potential conflict of interest between AOL Time Warner -- owner of the the nation's second-largest cable operation -- and AT&T Comcast, which would be the largest cable player.
8/21/2002	AOL in Deal To Regain All Of Large Unit	AOL Time Warner, AT&T and Comcast, three of the world's biggest media and communications companies, plan to announce a $9 billion deal today to unravel a complicated venture that has bedeviled them for years. The deal, capping more than two years of negotiations, allows all sides to declare victory -- although it may be more to the liking of AT&T and Comcast.
8/15/2002	AOL's Challenges Now Have Global Reach	Racing against a Securities and Exchange Commission deadline, Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of AOL Time Warner, certified the company's financial results late yesterday afternoon with the disclosure that its AOL division might have inflated revenue by $49 million in a period from the fall of 2000 through the summer of 2002. AOL Time Warner executives said that in the last 10 days the company had learned of three transactions that might have resulted in overstatements of revenue at its AOL division. The company said the revenue involved was less than one-half of 1 percent of overall revenue at the AOL division over the six quarters in question, but AOL Time Warner executives said an internal inquiry into its accounting continues and could uncover other problems.
8/15/2002	Paying the Price in Losses Overseas For Replicating U.S. Online Service	At the same time that America Online's domestic service is faltering, the strains in its nine overseas operations are becoming more apparent, too. As in the United States, AOL overseas is confronting a weak advertising market, slowing growth in subscribers and trouble competing with phone companies for high-speed service. In addition, it faces high telecommunication costs in some markets, economic turmoil in others and the disadvantage of being a late entrant in most.
8/14/2002	A Top AOL Manager Has Left Company	David M. Colburn, one of the top deal makers at America Online, left his job at the end of last week, company executives said last night. A former Hollywood lawyer, Mr. Colburn ran AOL's business affairs unit, which negotiated complicated and lucrative business deals for the online service during its most successful period, in the late 1990's. AOL became known at that time for aggressive tactics that led several dot-coms, and the big companies they meant to compete with, to bid against one another for placement on the service.
8/12/2002	MediaTalk; A Business Cliffhanger: AOL Time Warner	If Robert W. Pittman ever wanted to write a memoir, now might be an opportune time. In the weeks since he resigned under pressure as chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, book publishers have been racing to publish the definitive account of the tumultuous merger between AOL and Time Warner. Three books have already been signed up, including one by a journalist at AOL Time Warner's Time magazine who quit to write his book.
8/12/2002	AOL's Inventive Barter Deals Draw Scrutiny of Investigators	When America Online agreed to acquire Time Warner two years ago, AOL executives trumpeted their company's practice of striking two-way deals. Often, AOL bartered online advertising for shares in other Internet companies or for equipment or services at the same time it was concluding multimillion-dollar marketing agreements lasting several years. But these days, some of those complicated alliances are coming back to haunt the merged company, AOL Time Warner. As the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues investigations into some of AOL's down-on-their-luck Internet business partners like Homestore.com and PurchasePro.com, AOL Time Warner is finding its reputation tarnished by association. Now, in a less optimistic time, many of the company's deals, and the methods it used to account for the revenue they brought in, are coming under increased scrutiny from some investors.
8/11/2002	Snail Mail for AOL	To the Editor: The article about AOL (''The Stairmaster of Mergers,'' July 21) did not give sufficient attention to AOL's problems with spam. I continue to subscribe to AOL, primarily because of its relatively easy worldwide access, but the huge annoyance of spam dominates my negative feelings about the company's e-mail services. Based on surveys of AOL users, my views are widely shared.
8/11/2002	Snail Mail for AOL	To the Editor: One way AOL might be able to sustain subscriber growth is to cut prices and stop blanketing our neighborhoods with frequent and expensive mailings of unordered and unwanted plastic CD-rom disks in metal containers.
8/9/2002	AOL Time Warner Near Deal on a Unit, Again	AOL Time Warner, AT&T and Comcast are nearing a deal to dissolve the Time Warner Entertainment venture and could announce an agreement as soon as early next week, people close to the talks said yesterday. The companies are near a deal that would give AT&T about $2 billion in cash, about $1.5 billion in AOL Time Warner stock and 20 percent to 22 percent of a newly formed Time Warner Cable, according to the people close to the talks. In exchange, AT&T would give up its roughly 27 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, a complicated joint venture that includes the HBO pay-television operation and the Warner Brothers film studio.
8/7/2002	An Old-Line Executive For AOL's Online Unit	Even as he met repeatedly with senior executives at AOL Time Warner over the last several weeks, Jonathan F. Miller, who was named chief of the company's troubled America Online division yesterday, was sure he was not going to get the job. ''I'm flattered, but they're going to go with a rock star,'' Mr. Miller told James M. Citrin, the Spencer Stuart headhunter who led the search, when he was contacted in late June.
8/6/2002	Executive Of Net and TV Is Named Chief Of AOL Unit	AOL Time Warner has hired Jonathan F. Miller, an executive with both Internet and television experience, to be the next chief executive of its troubled America Online division, according to executives involved in the hiring. The appointment is expected to be announced today. Mr. Miller had been the president of USA Information and Services, the interactive unit of what had been known as USA Networks, the media and electronic commerce conglomerate run by Barry Diller. He resigned in June, after Mr. Diller sold USA's television and film units to focus his energies on the its Internet activities, making Mr. Miller's job superfluous.
8/5/2002	New Software (and New Bosses) at AOL Unit	At the blue glass headquarters of America Online here, there is a feeling that a four-year-old coup has finally been overturned. Management turmoil, government investigations and a plunge in the stock price of AOL Time Warner have caused more than a little confusion and consternation. But there is a flurry of activity as designers and programmers ready the annual release of new America Online software in October, one its designers say represents a very important step backward.
8/3/2002	AOL Chief Faces Two Choices; Each Is Worse Than the Other	In the next few weeks, Richard D. Parsons faces his first pivotal test as chief executive of AOL Time Warner: coming up with as much as $9 billion, beginning with an initial downpayment of at least $1 billion in cash. Mr. Parsons needs the money to buy out the 25 percent stake the company does not already own in Time Warner Entertainment -- a partnership that includes HBO, Warner Brothers Studios and Time Warner Cable. This fall, Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, will gain control of that stake and, eager for cash himself, wants AOL Time Warner to buy him out.
8/1/2002	U.S. Initiates Investigation Of Accounting At AOL Unit	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that the Justice Department had begun an investigation into accounting practices at its AOL division, after the initiation last week of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. AOL Time Warner reiterated yesterday that its outside auditors, Ernst & Young, had repeatedly certified its books. But the new investigation steps up the pressure and scrutiny on the AOL division, which is currently seeking a chief executive who can help stop a steep decline in its advertising revenue.
7/30/2002	AT&T and AOL Are Said to Seek Delay in Evaluation of Joint Entertainment Unit	Locked in talks over the fate of their joint venture of Time Warner Entertainment, AT&T and AOL Time Warner agreed yesterday to ask Bank of America to withhold its opinion on how much AT&T's stake is worth, according to executives close to the companies. The request was a sign that the companies expect to reach a settlement within weeks on dissolving the venture. While AOL has tried to persuade AT&T to swap its 27.3 percent of Time Warner Entertainment for a stake in a newly created Time Warner Cable operation, AT&T wants at least $1 billion in cash and billions of dollars in stock in the parent AOL Time Warner in addition to a stake in the cable subsidiary, according to people close to the negotiations.
7/29/2002	AT&T Asks $1 Billion of AOL Time Warner	AT&T is seeking at least $1 billion in cash from AOL Time Warner as a condition for accepting AOL's plan for dissolving the Time Warner Entertainment joint venture, according to people close to the negotiations. Responding to a request from the two companies, Bank of America is expected to deliver an opinion today on how much AT&T's stake in T.W.E. is worth and on how much of that stake investors could be expected to buy in a public offering. The bank's determination will form a basis for additional negotiations as AT&T and AOL Time Warner try to unravel their venture, which includes the HBO pay-television operation, the Warner Brothers film studio and most of AOL Time Warner's cable-TV systems.
7/28/2002	Creating Synergy Out of Thin Air	If there's any silver lining to the storm clouds now hovering over the merged AOL Time Warner, it's that it will probably be a long time before we hear anybody boasting about ''synergy'' again. Synergy is a word that practically demands to be rendered in quotes. As often as it has been used, its actual meaning is invariably hard to pin down. That's just as true now that the concept has become sort of a vague albatross rather than the magical creature it was supposed to be. Plenty of onlookers today say that most of the pieces of AOL Time Warner are perfectly sound and actually worth more than investors are willing to pay for them as a merged whole; the problem, apparently, is the very fact that they're linked.
7/27/2002	Man in Middle of AOL Deal Is Now at Center of a Storm	In the 18 months since his company, America Online, acquired the media giant Time Warner for $165 billion in stock, Stephen M. Case has left much of the work of integrating the companies and fulfilling their lofty promises to his prominent lieutenant, Robert W. Pittman. Now, however, after Mr. Pittman resigned under pressure last week, Mr. Case, AOL Time Warner's chairman, has been deprived of a lightning rod for shareholders' ire and has become the target of a growing chorus of criticism from analysts and investors saying the company's management might be better off purged of executives from AOL altogether, including him.
7/26/2002	AOL Falls 15% as Analysts Express Concern Over Ads	Shares of AOL Time Warner fell 15 percent yesterday, to $9.64, as a gloomy outlook for online advertising sales and concerns about accounting prompted half a dozen Wall Street brokerage firms to downgrade its stock. As shares of AOL fell from a high of $32.68 in January, analysts continued to recommend them, saying they had become a bargain. But many abandoned their support yesterday after the company disclosed a preliminary inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting and said advertising sales in its America Online division were weaker than expected.
7/25/2002	A 19-Year-Old F.B.I. Videotape Keeps Pulling Sharpton Back to the Past	The Rev. Al Sharpton once said he was created with no reverse in his transmission, but if so, he has shown he can brake suddenly and make U-turns. In the latest test of his adroitness, Mr. Sharpton has been responding to a secretly recorded 1983 F.B.I. videotape, included in an HBO report this week, that depicts him mostly listening but sometimes responding without commitment to an undercover agent masquerading as a Latin American drug lord offering to sell him kilos of cocaine.
7/25/2002	AOL Accounts Under Scrutiny From the S.E.C.	AOL Time Warner disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation into the accounting at its America Online division. The company said the investigation was started in response to two articles last week in The Washington Post that suggested that AOL might have inflated its revenue over a two-year period ending in March. The S.E.C. inquiry is the latest setback for AOL Time Warner as its new chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, struggles to cast off investor disappointment with the merger that created the company.
7/24/2002	2 Key Figures Try to Ally in Tense New AOL Time Warner	One of the first face-to-face meetings Jeff Bewkes had after being elevated to the executive floor of AOL Time Warner last week was with Jamie Kellner, the executive given control of Ted Turner's cable empire a year and a half ago. The two had lunch at Mr. Bewkes's home in Connecticut on Saturday. It was a sensitive moment. Under AOL Time Warner's new reorganization, Mr. Kellner would be reporting to Mr. Bewkes, an executive who only last week was one of his equals. It was also sensitive because Mr. Kellner had been one of the most visible allies inside Time Warner of Robert W. Pittman, the former chief operating officer who has come to symbolize the company's problems. Mr. Bewkes is said to have been among Mr. Pittman's most vocal opponents.
7/21/2002	A Search for Harmony Within a Feuding AOL	Could anyone have done Robert W. Pittman's job? For the media industry, it is no idle question. Mr. Pittman was the America Online executive charged with integrating his company with Time Warner after they merged, and he resigned last week under pressure from the same executives he was supposed to bring together.
7/21/2002	AOL's 'To Do' List	AOL's new chief executive -- the search is under way -- will have much to do to make the company grow again. These are among the necessary tasks that experts suggest. * Keep up subscriber growth. While AOL has the lowest churn in the industry, it still loses seven million customers a year that must be replaced before it can grow. One market to mine: Hispanic Internet users, a group that is growing faster than any other segment.
7/21/2002	The Stairmaster of Mergers	EVEN before it bought Time Warner two years ago, America Online had ambition to spare -- a sense that history, technology and markets were all going its way. It was a corporate attitude that often bordered on arrogance. The goal was nothing less than to ''establish AOL as the most valuable and respected company,'' declared Stephen M. Case, then chairman of America Online, in 1999. ''We won't settle for just one of them.''
7/20/2002	The AOL Time Warner Shuffle	When President Bush declared on Monday that the nation was waking up with a hangover after the economic boom of the last decade, he could not have known how much more pain was on the way. By week's end the stock market had plunged a further 7 percent, reaching lows it had not seen since 1998. One of the week's biggest losers was AOL Time Warner, a company whose stock has been in virtual free fall all year. In an attempt to turn around its own flagging fortunes, AOL Time Warner announced a major management shake-up, designed to take the company in a new direction and undo the damage of a merger that now stands as one of the biggest blunders in corporate history. Of all the giddy corporate moves of the 1990's, none now look more wrongheaded than Time Warner's decision to sell itself to AOL in a deal that put a higher value on the now-struggling Internet service than on Time Warner's vast stable of blue-chip media properties. After years of fumbling to come up with an online strategy, Time Warner decided to thrust itself into the New Economy by combining with AOL. Unfortunately for Time Warner shareholders, the C.E.O., Gerald Levin, chose precisely the wrong time to make his move. With AOL stock near its peak, he accepted a deal in which his shareholders were given just 45 percent of the combined company, even though Time Warner's divisions produced some 80 percent of the revenues.
7/20/2002	If Media Is Really AOL's Oyster, Its Biggest Pearl Is Clearly HBO	The same day that Jeff Bewkes moved up to become the chief operating officer and chairman of the newly formed entertainment group at AOL Time Warner, HBO, the division that he formerly ran, was putting an exclamation point on its recent domination of television entertainment by racking up an industry-high 93 nominations for the Emmy Awards. The juxtaposition of the events was not planned, but they were certainly related. Of the accomplishments that Mr. Bewkes brings to his new senior management duties at AOL Time Warner, none matter more than the results he produced at HBO, results measured not only in terms of profits, an area where HBO has done extremely well, but also in such intangible factors as prestige, cultural influence and public awareness.
7/20/2002	Madison Ave. Reconsidering Package Deals In Buying Ads	They say good things come in small packages, but does anything good come from ''one-stop shopping'' advertising packages? That is the question being asked more frequently on Madison Avenue in the wake of the turmoil at AOL Time Warner, the media conglomerate that has been the most zealous advocate of bundling its disparate properties to capture more advertising and promotional dollars from big marketers.
7/19/2002	Two Critics of Forced Synergy Are in Charge of It	Don Logan of Time Inc. and Jeff Bewkes of HBO, two allies who were critical of forced tries at cooperation after AOL merged with Time Warner, are now charged with deciding just how much synergy is enough. In the management revamping announced yesterday by AOL Time Warner, the duties of the former chief operating officer, Robert W. Pittman, were divided. Mr. Logan was named chairman of the newly created media and communications group, which consists of America Online, Time Inc., Warner Cable and the AOL Time Warner Book Group. Mr. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and network group, another new entity comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, the WB Network, Turner Networks, Warner Brothers and Warner music.
7/19/2002	The Fading Fortunes of AOL's 'Bob Pitchman'	On his ascent to the No. 3 position in the world's largest media company, Robert W. Pittman earned the nickname ''Bob Pitchman,'' the best marketer of his time. But as Mr. Pittman resigned his post at AOL Time Warner yesterday under pressure from the company's board, it appeared that he had fallen victim to his own sales pitch. Once seen as a master manager who could serve as the bridge between the old media and the new, Mr. Pittman came to personify the failures of the AOL-Time Warner merger.
7/19/2002	Pressure Building on the Chairman To Take Lead at AOL Time Warner	Meanwhile, where is Steve Case? For much of the last year, as AOL Time Warner's problems have mounted and its stock has crashed, Stephen M. Case, the company's chairman, has been all but invisible. The official explanation has tended to be that Mr. Case, 43, was caring for his older brother, Daniel H. Case III, the former chairman of the investment firm J. P. Morgan H&Q, who died of brain cancer last month.
7/19/2002	Shift at AOL Puts Time Warner at Helm	Robert W. Pittman, chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, resigned under pressure yesterday in the most public repudiation yet of the promises behind the $165 billion merger of AOL and Time Warner. The departure of Mr. Pittman, 48, who helped build AOL and became one of the merger's most vocal boosters, leaves the combined company almost entirely in the hands of veterans of Time Warner's old-media businesses. Richard D. Parsons, the recently named chief executive and a Time Warner stalwart, has reorganized the company under two executives whose old-media businesses have performed better than expected in recent years.
7/19/2002	Beyond Broken Promises	As the smoke lifts, it has become clear that the company that resulted from America Online's acquisition of Time Warner is very much like the old Time Warner. AOL Time Warner has strong brands but is dependent on the fickle advertising market. It has an experienced management, but one with a penchant for corporate infighting at Olympian levels. In fact, once all the broken promises about being a new breed of company for a new millennium are discounted, AOL Time Warner does not seem to be in such bad shape, considering the economy.
7/18/2002	With Upgrade To Software, MSN May Nip At AOL's Heels	Microsoft, which has yet to find a formula to compete profitably with America Online in the Internet market, is preparing to roll out this fall a new version of its Internet access software that is meant to exploit the perceived weakness of its rival's parent, AOL Time Warner. The new version of the MSN Explorer software, which connects MSN users to the Internet and enhances some of the features of its Web sites, is intended to match AOL's most popular offerings, like parental controls, and provide a bundle of other Microsoft products, like photo editing service.
7/15/2002	Market Place; Broad Skepticism Over Accounting Punishes the Stock Price of AOL	It could be a case of guilt by association, but the stock of AOL Time Warner seems to be weighed down by investor concerns that the company's accounting may not reflect its true financial state. How else to explain the lack of resilience in the company's stock price, despite relatively good news like AOL's having secured $10 billion in new bank loans a week ago. The company's executives may have hoped that news of the financing would reassure investors and alleviate some of the pressure on the shares. But they fell 10 percent last week to close at $13.14, down 59 percent so far this year. Over the last 12 months, AOL's stock performance has closely tracked that of Vivendi, a company facing significant financial difficulties.
7/11/2002	N.B.A. and AOL Drop Plan For an All-Sports Network	The National Basketball Association has decided not to start an all-sports network with AOL Time Warner. Instead, AOL Time Warner will pay $45 million for a 10 percent stake in NBA TV, the league's existing digital cable channel. NBA TV will carry 98 regular-season games, or about four a week, the same number as the proposed network would have carried.
7/7/2002	A Media Giant Needs a Script	IF Richard D. Parsons, the new chief executive of AOL Time Warner, had any questions about the state of morale inside the company, he doesn't anymore. For the last four weeks, Mr. Parsons has been conducting a whistle-stop tour of the company's power centers, meeting with the top executives of the many far-flung divisions, from Time publishing and New Line Cinema in New York to the headquarters of America Online in Dulles, Va.
7/3/2002	AOL Time Warner Under More Pressure	The efforts of AOL Time Warner's chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, to refurbish his company's battered credibility on Wall Street became a lot more difficult yesterday when its rival Vivendi Universal showed signs of falling apart. ''This is calling into question all of the merger and acquisition activity that has happened in media in the last decade,'' said Paul Kim, analyst at Kaufman Brothers. ''People are asking, do these conglomerate structures create any value, or do they blur visibility and make it hard for investors to figure out what is really going on in the company?''
7/2/2002	U.S. Warns Web Sites To Label Sponsorships	The Federal Trade Commission has warned the operators of several major Internet search engines to make it clearer to their users when companies have paid to be included in Web search results. The commission responded last week to a complaint filed a year ago by Commercial Alert, an anti-commercialism group co-founded by Ralph Nader.
6/26/2002	Market Place; Master Fixer Of AOL Suffers First Setback In Cable Loss	Richard D. Parsons, AOL Time Warner's new chief executive, is not renowned for embracing big, visionary risks, as is Rupert Murdoch. He does not style himself a creative force, as does Michael D. Eisner. And he is not known as a financial guru, as is John C. Malone. What Mr. Parsons is thought to do better than any of his fellow media magnates is manage people. He is known as the grand negotiator, the master conciliator, the finder of common ground, the inventor of win-win solutions; in short, the fixer. Mr. Parsons became the right-hand man to Gerald M. Levin, his predecessor, because when Mr. Levin had a serious problem with another company, he would send in Mr. Parsons to make things right. Most of the time, he did.
6/25/2002	Partner Takes Cable Systems, 2 Million Users From AOL	AOL Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, said yesterday that it had lost control of cable television systems serving more than two million customers. The development was a setback for AOL, which is the No. 2 cable television operator in the United States. It followed three months of negotiations in which AOL had sought unsuccessfully to retain the systems, which it controlled through a partnership with Advance/Newhouse Communications.
6/22/2002	AOL EXPANDS ITS TV REACH AMONG EUROPEAN YOUTH	AOL Time Warner agreed to buy the EMI Group's stake in the German music television broadcaster Viva Media for 52.3 million euros ($50.4 million). With the purchase, AOL Time Warner will raise its stake in Viva Media, a rival of MTV, to 30 percent. MTV's owner, Viacom of New York, said it had also been in talks to buy the Viva stake. Viva also operates channels in Hungary, Poland and the Netherlands. About 73 percent of Viva's viewers are 14 to 29 years old. EMI, whose artists include Janet Jackson, will gain about 43 million euros ($41.5 million) from the sale, it said.
6/14/2002	Viacom's Chief Defends Deals By Blockbuster With Studios	He started in the media business half a century ago with a small chain of movie theaters. But when Sumner M. Redstone took the stand here today in Federal District Court, it was as the star witness representing Big Media in a far-reaching antitrust case that pits owners of small video stores against some of the world's largest entertainment conglomerates. Mr. Redstone, the 79-year-old chairman of Viacom, defended himself and the relationships of Blockbuster, the video-rental business that is controlled by Viacom, with the major Hollywood studios.
6/5/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Earthlink To Sell Internet Access At Gateway	EarthLink Inc., the third-largest Internet service, will sell high-speed online access at Gateway stores. The access will be sold at 56 stores in cities like New York and San Diego, and the first month of the $41.95 service will be free, the companies said in a statement yesterday. The agreement calls for EarthLink to resell fast access provided by AOL Time Warner's cable television lines, part of an accord struck two years ago between EarthLink and AOL Time Warner. EarthLink, with about 4.9 million subscribers, has more than 532,000 high-speed customers. It is seeking to bolster that as more consumers opt for speedier Web access instead of service through traditional phone lines. Gateway will sell EarthLink's service to shoppers buying PC's in the stores and to those wanting to upgrade their computers with high-speed access. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
5/25/2002	Chief of AOL Time Warner Makes First Executive Shifts	Richard D. Parsons made his first significant personnel moves as AOL Time Warner's new chief executive yesterday. The moves did not bring any new executives to the company or entail any departures, but they appeared to represent a first step toward Mr. Parsons's goal of streamlining management. Mr. Parsons became chief executive of AOL Time Warner earlier this month, succeeding Gerald M. Levin. Yesterday's changes appeared to represent a consolidation of power under Mr. Parsons in some areas that previously had been the province of Stephen M. Case, the chairman of AOL Time Warner.
5/20/2002	MediaTalk; Condé Chief Says He's Not Headed to AOL	This much is known: Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive at Condé Nast Publications, met several times in the last year with Robert W. Pittman, chief operating officer at AOL Time Warner. But divining the implication of the meetings is where matters become complicated. Two of Mr. Florio's friends said he told them that ''very serious'' job discussions were held. ''Steve told me that he had several conversations with Bob Pittman about the possibility of eventually replacing Don Logan,'' said a longtime associate of Mr. Florio, referring to the current chief executive of Time Inc.
5/20/2002	New Economy; Many 'Star Wars' fans went online to avoid a long line.	WHEN ''The Empire Strikes Back,'' the first ''Star Wars'' sequel, opened in 1980, fans dressed as their favorite characters and lined up days before to buy tickets. Predictably, the latest sequel, which opened on Thursday, also had strong advance interest. But fewer moviegoers waited in line. Instead, many bought their tickets online -- through AOL Moviefone, MovieTickets, Fandango or the ticket-sales Web sites of various theater chains.
5/17/2002	At AOL, Parting Without the Sweet Sorrow	After AOL Time Warner's annual meeting yesterday, Richard D. Parsons told reporters that the shareholders who gathered at the Apollo Theater in Harlem had been ''more gracious and respectful than I had anticipated.'' Mr. Parsons must have expected torches and pitchforks. While his coronation as AOL Time Warner's chief executive went off as planned yesterday, it was clear that the shareholders were irate. They, after all, have suffered the collapse of the stock price, which has lost about 64 percent of its value in the last year.
5/11/2002	EBAY TO PAY AOL LESS IN AMENDED COMMISSION AGREEMENT	EBay said it would pay less to AOL Time Warner after renegotiating an advertising sales and marketing agreement last month. EBay will pay a maximum of $15 million in the agreement's first renewal year, rather than the $18.8 million it was to have paid in the period, which ends March 23, 2004, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. AOL provides online advertising and marketing services for eBay. EBay is a provider of online trading services on AOL sites, and the companies have a co-branded Web site. The companies adjusted the commission structure for advertising sales and shortened the term of the agreement to March 31, 2003, from its previous termination at the end of next year. EBay will pay $10 million if the contract is extended for the year ending March 23, 2005.
5/7/2002	Chief-to-Be Says AOL Has One Problem Area	Richard D. Parsons, who will become AOL Time Warner's chief executive later this month, said today that the company still faced significant problems and still had to answer questions about its strategic direction. But he vigorously defended the overall vision for AOL Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, and said there were no plans to split the company. ''We're the No. 1 movie company, the No. 1 online company, the No. 1 premium cable network company, the No. 1 cable network company, No. 2 cable company, No. 2 music company,'' he said here in a panel discussion at the cable television industry's annual convention. ''What am I missing?
4/29/2002	Reviving AOL Time Warner	When Richard Parsons, AOL Time Warner's incoming C.E.O., spoke to a roomful of Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth business school students last week, he made a joking plea. ''I'm desperately in need of a strategy,'' he told his youthful audience. One group that is not laughing at Mr. Parsons' wry remark is AOL shareholders, who have been forced to look on glumly as management reported a $54.2 billion quarterly loss last week, the largest in United States history, and as the stock has plummeted nearly 40 percent since January. Mr. Parsons, who officially moves up to his new post next month, is taking the helm of a company built around a big bet that has not yet paid off. In January 2000, when the merger of America Online and Time Warner was first announced, the two companies declared that they were building a new kind of media company for a new age. The fast-growing AOL was going to be the growth engine of the new entity, carrying Time Warner's stodgy old media divisions along with it. The biggest upside from the deal would be the synergy that would result as AOL's Internet service and Time Warner's cable, movie, music and print businesses cross-promoted each other, making the sum of the two companies far greater than their parts.
4/29/2002	MediaTalk; Jerry Who? Try Finding AOL Time Warner Chief in New Report	Whatever happened to Gerald M. Levin? Mr. Levin is still the chief executive of AOL Time Warner -- and will be through the middle of May. But he is nowhere to be found in the two-page, single-spaced letter to shareholders in the company's recently released 2001 annual report.
4/25/2002	Ad Slump at AOL to Cause Parent to Miss 2002 Goals	AOL Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, said yesterday that it would not achieve its original financial goals for 2002 because the online advertising market had deteriorated even further than it had expected. The announcement came as AOL Time Warner announced first-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, even though the company reported a $54.2 billion net loss, among the biggest quarterly losses in corporate history. That loss was a result of an expected noncash charge reflecting a steep decline in the company's value since America Online, the premier company in cyberspace, agreed to acquire Time Warner, the No. 1 company in traditional media, in January 2000.
4/24/2002	Harvard Team Ranks First In Telling AOL What to Do	Lisa Diane Bourne, Tjada P. D'Oyen, Sitella A. Glenn and Panya Lei Yarber say that AOL Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, should focus not on integrating its far-flung divisions but rather on running them more or less separately. Do they know something that Richard D. Parsons does not? The $20,000 that Goldman, Sachs & Company paid the four women yesterday say that maybe they do.
4/21/2002	How Does AOL Fit in the Grand Plan Now?	STEPHEN M. CASE, Richard D. Parsons and Robert W. Pittman, the men at the helm of AOL Time Warner, do not yet agree on just how the America Online Internet service -- one of the company's biggest divisions -- should evolve or on just how quickly it can grow over the next few years. As Mr. Parsons, a renowned corporate diplomat, prepares to take over as AOL Time Warner's chief executive next month, forging that consensus is his most important challenge, and a vital one for the company, the world's largest media conglomerate. America Online's slowing growth over the last year and its failure to meet Wall Street expectations have been a drag on the company's shares. And the absence of a unified vision of America Online's future -- of just how the Internet can work with old media like movies to deliver vast new profits, as promised -- is raising questions anew about the wisdom of the merger that created the company two years ago, at the peak of the Internet bubble.
4/21/2002	A Jilted Band Finds Love After All	SELDOM was heard an encouraging word while the band Wilco was making its extraordinary new album, ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.'' Executives at Reprise Records, the label that released Wilco's previous albums, were not pleased. The music, they said, veered too far from the rootsy rock that Wilco was known for. So despite Wilco's steady sales, constant touring and committed fans, the label decided last spring that ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' wasn't worth releasing. The album wasn't likely to sell a million copies, and below that level major labels lose interest. Mid-level bands like Wilco can be left stranded, but Wilco became one of the lucky ones. It got its album back and is releasing it unchanged. In fact, ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is appearing on the Nonesuch label, which, like Reprise, is part of AOL Time Warner. A statement from the Warner Music Group says: ''One of the advantages of having a company as large and diverse as W.M.G. is that when you have a fantastic band like Wilco, and one situation doesn't work out for one reason or another, they can continue to make this company their home.''
4/21/2002	Surprises Leave Investors Fuming	INVESTOR confidence in AOL Time Warner has been badly damaged by its optimistic promises that haven't been met and its periodic failure to disclose negative news in a timely way. With the company set to report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, shareholders are remembering its filings of last month, which held ugly surprises about potential restructuring costs. ''When it comes to disclosure practices, they pass,'' said Glenn L. Reynolds, the chief executive of the research firm Creditsights.com. ''But they only get a gentleman's C.''
4/19/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Advanced Set-Top Boxes To Be Shipped	Scientific Atlanta is shipping its advanced home entertainment server, the Explorer 8000, to homes this week for trials. AOL Time Warner has already ordered 100,000 units of the Explorer 8000, which its maker says is the first cable box with built-in digital video recording capability. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)
4/15/2002	AOL Slips As It Tries To Get Grip On Market	Everything that the critics said about America Online turned out to be true -- years later. Until recently, AOL has been such a juggernaut, it is hard to remember how little respect the company got the first decade of its quest to wire the world into one big chat room.
4/14/2002	New Choice in Retirement Plans	AOL Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company have decided to let all employees invest matching 401(k) retirement funds into investments other than the companies' own shares. AOL Time Warner, which contributes as much as $2,000 a year in matching funds to each employee's 401(k) plan, relaxed its rules this month, Tricia Primrose, a company spokeswoman, told Bloomberg News. Disney made the change in March, said John Dreyer, a spokesman.
4/12/2002	AOL Time Warner Stock Hits Postmerger Low	AOL Time Warner's stock has plunged 10 percent over the last two days, as investors have grown concerned about the company's balance sheet, turmoil in its Internet unit and stock sales by a big shareholder. The stock closed yesterday at $19.60 in heavy trading, piercing the $20 mark for the first time since late 1998, more than a year before AOL announced plans to acquire Time Warner.
4/11/2002	AOL SHARES PLUNGE AFTER $368 MILLION BLOCK SALE	Shares of AOL Time Warner fell to their lowest level since the company was formed yesterday after a $368 million block sale of its stock was brokered. Credit Suisse First Boston arranged the sale of 18.4 million shares for a single seller at $20 each, 8.5 percent below the close on Tuesday. The stock fell $1.15, to $20.70, and was the biggest decliner in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. America Online and Time Warner merged 15 months ago. The sale came a day after AOL Time Warner replaced Barry Schuler as chief executive at America Online because the unit's fourth-quarter advertising sales tumbled.
4/10/2002	Market Place; Possible Savior Returns to AOL As Its Growth Appears Weak	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that Robert W. Pittman, its co-chief operating officer, would resume day-to-day management of the company's flagship America Online Internet service, 15 months after he gave up that post. The move underscores the sense of urgency about America Online's slowing growth. It may also end rumors that Mr. Pittman might leave AOL Time Warner because his co-equal, Richard D. Parsons, is being promoted over him to become the corporation's chief executive.
3/27/2002	Money for After-School Programs	The After-School Corporation, a nonprofit organization that fosters after-school activities in New York, received $250,000 from the AOL Time Warner Foundation recently for new programs for 2,500 students who attend the schools near the World Trade Center site. ''We are thrilled,'' said LUCY N. FRIEDMAN, president of the corporation. ''This gift ensured that we would have the resources to provide high-quality after-school care. And after 9/11, parents are particularly concerned about whom their kids are with.'' Yilu Zhao
3/27/2002	AOL Officials Got No Bonuses in 2001, but Lots of Options	After receiving regular bonuses in recent years, AOL Time Warner's top executives received no bonuses in 2001 but reaped more than $250 million from the exercise of stock options, according to a company filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stephen M. Case, the chairman; Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive; Kenneth J. Novack, a vice chairman; Ted Turner, the other vice chairman; Richard D. Parsons, co-chief operating officer; and Robert W. Pittman, also co-chief operating officer, each received a salary of $1 million last year and no bonus.
3/26/2002	Market Place; AOL Suggests Move by Malone and Other Risks	AOL Time Warner may soon face a move by John C. Malone to expand his ownership and obtain a seat on the board. Mr. Malone, the cable industry mogul, is barred from voting his shares in AOL Time Warner. But last Tuesday, his company, Liberty Media, asked the Federal Trade Commission to change a consent decree so that he might own full voting shares without limit, according to AOL Time Warner's annual filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
3/22/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Analyst Offers Warning On AOL	An influential Internet analyst cut her estimates yesterday for AOL Time Warner's sales and profits, expressing concern over the outlook for online advertising revenue. ''The single biggest risk to AOL Time Warner's near-term earnings is the AOL division and advertising in particular,'' Holly Becker, new-media and e-commerce analyst for Lehman Brothers, wrote in a research report. ''Several difficult quarters lie ahead.'' Ms. Becker cut her first-quarter sales expectation for the company to $9.4 billion from $9.7 billion. Many of the lucrative marketing contracts that AOL signed during the Internet bubble have already expired or will soon. The prevailing rates for these arrangements are now much lower than they were at the time of the original deals. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
3/14/2002	Piracy, or Innovation? It's Hollywood vs. High Tech	Leaders of two of the nation's most prominent industries, entertainment and technology, have begun publicly sniping at each other over how to stop consumers from illegally copying digital movies, music and television programs. The feud grows out of Hollywood's frustration with the illicit flow of copyrighted works over the Internet. Despite courtroom victories against Napster and others deemed to contribute to Internet piracy, millions of people continue to download free digital copies of everything from Jennifer Lopez's latest hit single to the Disney movie ''Monsters, Inc.''
3/3/2002	Columbus Circle's Towers Start to Tower	SHORTLY before noon last Wednesday, as Wynton Marsalis led six members of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra in a rousing ''Buddy Bolden's Blues,'' a steel beam was hoisted into the snowy skies over Columbus Circle on its way up to the south tower of AOL Time Warner Center. It was, in almost every respect, a proper topping-out. The beam was ornamented with a small evergreen and a flag, as tradition dictates. Tribute was paid to the 400 workers who went to ground zero on the night of Sept. 11. The mayor made a little speech. Camel-hair coats and hard hats mingled.
2/26/2002	Screen Actors Guild Agrees to New Rules for Talent Agencies	The Screen Actors Guild and the associations representing talent agents have reached a tentative agreement on a pact that allows talent agencies to be owned in part by other companies and permits them to become more economically involved in production companies. The agreement, reached Sunday evening, would allow a talent agency to invest up to 20 percent -- an increase of 10 percentage points -- in an independent production company and allows advertisers or independent production companies to buy as much as 20 percent of a talent agency over two years. Movie studios and television networks -- as well as their parent companies like Viacom Inc., AOL Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company -- remain barred by an industry agreement from such investments.
2/25/2002	The Oxygen TV Channel Is Bowing To Tastes	It is Friday late afternoon. On one cable channel for women, there is an earnest documentary on the struggle for equality by the women's crew team at Yale in 1976. On another, there is a made-for-TV movie, starring Joanna Kerns (of the old hit sitcom ''Growing Pains''), about a woman who develops amnesia, and forgets that her husband is molesting their child.
2/21/2002	A New Tone, And Leader, At Time Inc.; At People Magazine, Pivotal Change in Editor	When John Huey became editorial director of Time Inc. in July, he knew that he would soon be confronted by a decision that would dwarf all others: replacing the managing editor at People magazine, the profitable cornerstone of all of the other endeavors at Time Inc. Carol Wallace, the managing editor whose ''golden gut'' helped make the magazine the best money maker on the planet, had indicated that she wanted to leave.
2/20/2002	Court Ruling May Change Landscape For Media	Investment bankers, start your engines. That was essentially the message to Wall Street and the media industry yesterday as a federal appeals court in Washington unleashed what is expected to be a major wave of deal making, with the titans of the television business snapping up their smaller brethren.
2/11/2002	In Warner Brothers' Strategy, A Movie Is Now a Product Line; Making Franchise Films That Build Brand Names	Robert W. Pittman, soon to be promoted to the chief operating officer's job at AOL Time Warner, last week made his first inspection of one of the many units he will command: the Warner Brothers studio in Burbank. For Warner executives, the timing was ideal.
2/8/2002	Computer Safety Is Focus of Bill	The House approved more than $800 million in grants today covering the next five years for the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to conduct research on ways to strengthen network and computer security. ''Our economy relies on a vast information infrastructure that is woefully under protected,'' said Representative Brian Baird, Democrat of Washington.
2/7/2002	Software Puts Together What I.M. Has Torn Asunder	Mom uses AOL Instant Messenger, your business partner has MSN Messenger, and your pals all prefer ICQ. What's a person-to-person chatter to do? One option is Trillian, software that can be downloaded from the Web site of a fledgling Connecticut company, Cerulean Studios (www.trillian.cc). The newest version was released last week and is free (although the company happily welcomes donations).
1/31/2002	THE MARKETS: Market Place; AT&T and AOL are very different and yet very much alike.	FROM the personality of their executives to the source of their power, AT&T and AOL Time Warner are very different sorts of companies. Yet as both titans reported quarterly financial results yesterday, it became clear that there were important similarities in the challenges they face and even in their responses to the obstacles. AT&T, the No. 1 long-distance communications company, and AOL Time Warner, the largest Internet and media company, each reported losing money in the fourth quarter of 2001. AT&T's loss was smaller than during the comparable period a year earlier. AOL's was bigger. By AOL's preferred measure of earnings, which excludes many charges, the company's results matched analysts' expectations. By a similar measure, AT&T's results barely beat expectations.
1/25/2002	A New Take On Retirement Of AOL Chief	Call it courage, or corporate guilt, or some random element that does not yet have a name. The story begins with Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive of AOL Time Warner. When he suddenly announced plans to step down last month, he insisted that the whole move was his idea. ''I'd been planning this for a while,'' Mr. Levin, 62, said at the time. But in the Feb. 4 issue of Fortune, the flagship business magazine in the AOL Time Warner empire, the writer Carol Loomis reports that one company board member, Fay Vincent, told someone else that Mr. Levin had been forced out. Ms. Loomis then devotes several column inches to detailing the numerous ways she was shut out in her quest to confirm the story.
1/25/2002	A determined effort to recruit mentors to work with youths.	AN ambitious campaign meant to change behavior, not sell products, is under way, the first of its scope since Sept. 11 that is unrelated to the terrorist attacks. The public service campaign seeks to recruit adults as mentors for children by designating January as what 17 nonprofit organizations hope will be the first annual National Mentoring Month.
1/24/2002	Judge Grants A Suspension Of Lawsuit On Napster	A federal judge has granted a request by four of the five major record companies to suspend their three-year-old lawsuit against Napster, the Internet music service that exploded in popularity by allowing users to freely exchange songs and was deemed by the record companies a threat to their existence. The order, by Judge Marilyn Patel of Federal District Court in San Francisco, released today to parties in the lawsuit, grants only a 30-day suspension, but it underscores a turnabout in the strategy by the music companies and a possible shift in momentum in their case.
1/24/2002	In AOL's Suit Against Microsoft, the Key Word Is Access	The sweeping lawsuit filed on Tuesday by AOL Time Warner on behalf of its Netscape subsidiary against Microsoft reflects AOL's fears that Microsoft, if left unchecked, will use its software to control how AOL's media assets are packaged and delivered over the Internet. ''This lawsuit is about the future and how that future will play out,'' said Neil MacDonald, an analyst with the Gartner Group. ''AOL is trying to challenge the Microsoft threat here and now.''
1/23/2002	The N.B.A. Takes the Money in a Fast Break to Cable	The National Basketball Association is suffering from declining ratings and the advertising marketplace is in a tailspin, yet those obstacles did not prevent AOL Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company from agreeing to new television deals worth $4.6 billion to the league over the next six seasons. In deals announced yesterday, Disney will pay the league $2.4 billion for games that will be shown on ESPN and ABC; AOL Time Warner is paying $2.2 billion to televise games on TNT and to create a new all-sports network with the league.
1/23/2002	An AOL Unit Sues Microsoft, Saying Tactics Were Illegal	The Netscape Communications Corporation, the commercial pioneer in Web browsing software, whose fortunes faded after a withering assault from Microsoft, filed a broad antitrust suit yesterday against the company. Netscape charged that its decline was a result of Microsoft's illegal tactics, echoing many of the findings in the government's case against the company. The suit represents a new round of legal trouble for Microsoft, carrying the potential for billions of dollars in damages and new sanctions on its behavior.
1/15/2002	Miscellany	Unilever signed a multimedia marketing alliance with AOL Time Warner, New York, to advertise its brands, including Dove and Good Humor. Terms were not disclosed.
1/10/2002	N.B.A. TV Deal May Kill CNN/SI	Employees of the sports network CNN/Sports Illustrated were told yesterday that it will most likely cease to exist by the fall in anticipation of its becoming a network owned by the N.B.A. and AOL Time Warner. ''There was an internal meeting in which the future was discussed with CNN/SI's employees,'' said Greg Hughes, a spokesman for Turner Sports, an AOL Time Warner subsidiary.
1/10/2002	Parsons's Numbers	What a time for a promotion. Richard D. Parsons, co-chief operating officer at AOL Time Warner, will not become the company's chief executive until May, but he is already acting as if he has the job. And it is already apparent that the job will be even harder than many media professionals would have expected when his promotion was announced barely more than a month ago.
1/9/2002	NBC Will Live Without N.B.A. and Without Losses From It	To Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, relinquishing the rights to televise the National Basketball Association after this season is all about financial common sense. ''The idea of winning in this business has gotten distorted,'' he said yesterday during an interview with New York Times reporters and editors. ''To lose hundreds of millions of dollars is not winning.''
1/4/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: AOL Fixes Instant Messenger Flaw	AOL Time Warner announced yesterday that a security flaw in its popular Instant Messenger software had been fixed. The problem, which was revealed earlier this week, was exposed by a group of young security researchers led by Matt Conover, a 19-year-old Utah State University student. Hackers exploiting the security hole could have taken control of a user's home computer running America Online's Instant Messenger software. Andrew Weinstein, an AOL spokesman, said the repair was done in such a way that ''users do not have to download anything or take any other action.'' Andrew Zipern (NYT)
1/3/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Instant Messenger Found To Be Flawed	A newly revealed security hole in the Instant Messenger program of AOL Time Warner could expose the computer of anyone using the software to control by hackers, security experts said yesterday. A loose confederation of security researchers known as w00w00 published a report on the problem, along with ''proof of concept'' software that could be modified to exploit the problem. Matt Conover, founder of the group, suggested that Instant Messenger users restrict incoming messages to those from their buddy lists until the problem is corrected. Andrew Weinstein, an AOL spokesman, said the company would be able to fix the program ''within the next day or two'' without requiring that customers download any software patch. ''To our knowledge,'' Mr. Weinstein said, ''the vulnerability hasn't affected any users yet.'' John Schwartz (NYT)
12/31/2001	Box Office Was Busy, And Potter Was King	Despite the widespread perception that it has been a lackluster year for Hollywood movies and fears that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 would keep people rooted at home and away from multiplexes, 2001 has turned out to be yet another record-breaking year at the box office. And the Thanksgiving-to-New Year holiday season has produced at least four solid blockbusters -- ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' which ended as the year's No. 1 film with an estimated $286.1 million; ''Monsters, Inc.,'' which ended the year in third place at $236.3 million; ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,'' which has earned $154.5 million in just 12 days of release and was by far the No. 1 movie for Christmas week; and ''Ocean's Eleven,'' which has made $128 million since opening in early December and actually saw its weekend box office go up 18 percent this past weekend.
12/22/2001	A Clash of Online Titans	AT&T's sale of its cable television business, the nation's largest, to Comcast, the third-largest, is more than another episode in the continuing consolidation of the nation's cable industry. The bidding war for AT&T Broadband must also be seen as another skirmish in the conflict between Microsoft and AOL Time Warner to control the information pipes that bring news, entertainment and communications services into American households. If federal regulators approve this cable merger, as seems likely, they must impose conditions aimed at preserving and fostering competition in the online world. Microsoft owns a stake in Comcast, though it does not directly operate cable systems itself. But with cable companies' digital or ''broadband'' pipelines ideally positioned to distribute high-speed Internet access, interactive TV and perhaps even local phone service, Microsoft clearly wants to ensure its access to cable. It wants to expand its own Internet service provider and build as dominant a franchise in the market for cable operating software as it has for personal computers.
12/22/2001	Ted Turner Signs a 2-Year Agreement With AOL Time Warner	Ted Turner, the vice chairman of AOL Time Warner, signed a two-year contract at the media and Internet company yesterday, a couple of weeks after the chief executive-designate, Richard D. Parsons, asked him to stay. Maura Donlan, a spokeswoman for Mr. Turner in Atlanta, declined to comment on terms of the agreement, as did an AOL Time Warner spokesman, Ed Adler.
12/21/2001	For AOL, Goals Are Deferred, Not Denied	In losing its bid for AT&T Broadband, AOL Time Warner may have failed to instantly become the dominant cable force that it might have. But even though the AT&T unit will be combined with Comcast and have significant backing from AOL's rival, Microsoft, AOL's main objectives are likely to be deferred rather than denied. For AOL, AT&T's 13.8 million cable subscribers represented important potential customers for its cable networks, like CNN, and high-speed versions of its America Online.
12/20/2001	COMCAST WINS BID FOR AT&T'S CABLE	AT&T agreed yesterday to sell its cable television business, the nation's largest, to the Comcast Corporation for about $47 billion in stock. The deal would create a cable giant with more than 22 million subscribers, almost twice the size of the next-biggest cable operator, AOL Time Warner, which was a losing bidder in the deal.
12/20/2001	Clash of the Convergers	Comcast won the auction for AT&T's cable television business yesterday, but the other big winner was Microsoft. Using its deep pockets, Microsoft gave financial support to the Comcast bid and thus played the spoiler in denying the prize to its archrival, AOL Time Warner. Most of the nation's 70 million cable television subscribers may wonder why so much corporate emotion and money were involved in the fight over AT&T's cable business. To most people, a cable network is merely a way of delivering garden-variety television and collecting monthly bills.
12/19/2001	AT&T's Board To Meet Today On Cable Sale Or a Spinoff	Amid a late push by AOL Time Warner, AT&T's board is to meet in Manhattan today to decide whether to sell the company's cable television operation or instead spin it off as an independent company. AOL Time Warner, Comcast and Cox Communications have each submitted bids to acquire AT&T's cable business, the nation's biggest.
12/17/2001	AT&T Weighs Cable Unit Sale as Bids Are Revised	Bidders in the auction for AT&T's cable television business submitted revised offers late yesterday in a last-ditch effort to persuade AT&T's board to sell the operation. AOL Time Warner, Comcast and Cox Communications submitted reworked offers, according to executives involved in the auction, after an admonishment last week from AT&T's chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, that the bids were inadequate.
12/16/2001	Stern's Look to a Future on Cable TV Will Put NBC in the Past	It began as a win-win relationship more than a decade ago. David Stern had the players, Dick Ebersol rolled the cameras, and away they went, promoting each other's products until the world started paying attention. Together they made lots of money and commercials and guided the National Basketball Association to the pinnacle of popularity. To gauge the league's mass-culture growth since 1990, one need only see the Palestinian youth in the background of a recent CNN report wearing the No. 23 Chicago Bulls jersey.
12/16/2001	At 63, Ted Turner May Yet Roar Again	TED TURNER is not known for his restraint, so it did not really surprise fellow board members at AOL Time Warner last month to hear him complain to them about the leadership of their chief executive, Gerald M. Levin. Mr. Turner was just as blunt with cable industry executives gathered in Anaheim, Calif., in November, telling them that one of his biggest regrets was selling his broadcasting empire to Time Warner in 1996 instead of buying the media giant. ''I could have fired Gerry Levin before he fired me,'' he said.
12/15/2001	'01 Media Model: Content and Distribution Go Together	Ever since Jean-Marie Messier began aspiring to turn Vivendi Universal from a French water company into a global media conglomerate, critics have said its weakness was a lack of control over the distribution of its entertainment products. After all, Vivendi's main competitors -- AOL Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -- combined content and distribution, and experts said they represented the smart paradigm. Mr. Messier's deal-making this week finally gives him distribution, through the EchoStar Communications and DirecTV satellite systems, and lets him poke Mr. Murdoch in the eye as well, since the News Corporation had hoped to win control of DirecTV itself. DirecTV is owned by General Motors.

12/14/2001	AT&T IS SAID TO BE REQUESTING NEW BIDS FOR CABLE UNIT	AT&T has asked the three companies that are vying to acquire its cable television business to submit new proposals by Sunday morning, people close to the talks said yesterday. AT&T's board is set to weigh the offers on Wednesday and could make a final decision on the cable unit's fate at that meeting, the people said. AOL Time Warner, Comcast and Cox Communications have each submitted bids to acquire the unit. At a meeting last weekend, AT&T's board deemed each of those offers inadequate. Financial details have not been disclosed, but any sale would be worth at least $40 billion. Seth Schiesel (NYT)
12/14/2001	N.B.A. and AOL Consider Cable Deal	The National Basketball Association and AOL Time Warner have agreed in principle to create a cable network that would show the league's games, said executives with knowledge of the negotiations. But an announcement will not be made until the contract is signed.
12/12/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: AOL To Test Music Service	America Online said it would begin offering a test version of its digital music subscription service, MusicNet 1.0. The service is based on MusicNet, a partnership of Real Networks and the record labels owned by AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann and the EMI Group. Last week, Real Networks released RealOne, the first pay-for-play service to come out of MusicNet. AOL said it planned to make the service broadly available in January for $9.95 a month.
12/12/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Motorola To Offer Instant Messenger	AOL Time Warner and Motorola have entered into a multiyear marketing and technology alliance that will, among other things, allow Motorola to build AOL's Instant Messenger feature into its wireless devices. Instant Messenger is available on one other wireless device, the Nokia 3390, which is sold in conjunction with VoiceStream's cellular service. The AOL Time Warner alliance with Motorola will not affect the VoiceStream agreement. The terms of the alliance were not disclosed. Catherine Greenman (NYT)
12/12/2001	Gambling on a Film Fantasy; 'Lord of the Rings' Shows New Line Cinema's Value to AOL	The recent management shuffle at the top of AOL Time Warner -- in which Richard D. Parsons, a veteran Time Warner executive, emerged as the surprise successor to the retiring chief executive, Gerald M. Levin -- only revived a question that has nagged New Line Cinema, a mere cog in the company's vast global empire, for years: What does AOL Time Warner, which already has Warner Brothers studios, , need with a second, separate film studio? The answer lies in sprawling tale of good versus evil in a mythical world populated by elves, dwarfs, wizards, goblins and a three-foot-tall, hairy-footed hero named Frodo Baggins.
12/11/2001	New Job for Secret Service Official	Larry L. Cockell, the deputy director of the Secret Service and former agent in charge of President Bill Clinton's protective detail, will retire in January to become chief of security for AOL Time Warner, the Secret Service announced today. Mr. Cockell, the highest-ranking African-American in Secret Service history, gained notoriety when he was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter in 1998. Investigators from the independent counsel's office summoned Mr. Cockell to testify about what he might have seen or heard when he accompanied Mr. Clinton to a deposition taken in January 1998, for the lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.
12/11/2001	Chief-Designate At AOL Asks Turner to Stay	The Great Conciliator has gone to work. Last week, in the first days after being named the next chief executive of AOL Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, Richard D. Parsons spoke with dozens, if not hundreds, of people.
12/10/2001	Warner's Sound Check; At AOL Time Warner, The Music Unit Poses A True Challenge For the New Regime	Roger Ames, the gregarious chief executive of the Warner Music Group, can hardly be confused with a laboratory scientist. He is a longtime figure of the recording industry who cheerfully peppers his conversations with profanities at a rate that is prolific even by the standards of the music business. And he is a regular among the let's-do-lunch set that jams clubs and restaurants in Beverly Hills and Manhattan. But these days Mr. Ames is embarking on what could become the group's riskiest sales and marketing experiment to date -- one devised not only to confront the nation's general spending malaise but to address the vagaries of an industry suffering its worst economic slump in almost a decade.
12/10/2001	AT&T Finds Cable TV Bids Unacceptable	AT&T has reviewed the three competing bids for its cable television business, the nation's largest, and found all of them inadequate. AT&T's chairman conveyed that message to the bidders -- AOL Time Warner, Comcast and Cox Communications -- on Saturday evening, after its board spent the day considering the bids. Although the board is hoping that the response may elicit one or more sweetened offers, people close to the deliberations said, it is beginning to seem that AT&T is once again leaning toward a spinoff of its cable business into an independent company.
12/10/2001	AOL Time Warner's Hits	AOL Time Warner has had a good year at the movies -- and not only on the strength of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' The company, which announced last week that Richard D. Parsons would succeed Gerald M. Levin as chief executive when Mr. Levin retires next May, is leading the film industry, with a 19.1 percent of share of total box-office receipts in 2001 to date. Through Dec. 2, the three movie divisions -- Warner Brothers, New Line Cinema and Fine Line Pictures -- had grossed more than $1.36 billion. And that does not count Warner Brothers' ''Ocean's 11,'' which opened this past weekend, New Line's widely anticipated ''Lord of the Rings,'' which opens Dec. 19.
12/9/2001	AOL Time Warner and the Sorcerer's Stock	IF there were any investors out there who still thought AOL Time Warner was first and foremost an Internet company, the ascension last week of Richard D. Parsons to chief executive-to-be brought them out of their new-economy reverie. But while company insiders gossip over which company really took over which a year ago -- the Time Warner folks seem to think that Mr. Parsons's rise makes them triumphant -- investors have a more substantive concern: How quickly are the different AOL Time Warner businesses growing and how should the stock be valued as a result?
12/9/2001	The Newest Tower: Working 24/7	ON the western rim of Columbus Circle, on the site of the old Coliseum, stands the skeleton of the city's newest skyscraper, the AOL Time Warner Center. At the moment, it is a mesh of steel and scaffolding 19 stories tall, but when completed in two years, the $1.7 billion center's twin towers will reach 53 stories, or 750 feet. Such a height cannot rival the city's tallest buildings. The Empire State Building is 1,250 feet, the twin towers of the World Trade Center were 1,368 and 1,362 feet. But in its complexity and small measure of controversy, the building typifies the modern high-rise.
12/9/2001	New Boss for a Media Giant Is an Old Hand at New York	His remarks made, the party having peaked, Richard Dean Parsons seems to swim for the door, a man in a tuxedo fighting a tide. After a yard of progress, a hand reaches out. Mr. Parsons studies the face for an instant, breaks into a smile of recognition, inclines his head to hear some confidential whispering. Then he makes another yard. A quick picture, please, please stand between the young man and the woman. And then more: hugs, backslaps, congratulations, for even though this is a party honoring someone else, Mr. Parsons had been named a day earlier as the next chief executive of AOL Time Warner.
12/8/2001	CNN Will Cancel 3 Shows and Cut 30 Jobs	The Cable News Network said today that it was canceling three shows and cutting about 30 jobs. CNN, a division of AOL Time Warner, will cancel the weekday shows ''Burden of Proof'' and ''NewsSite'' and the weekend show ''Showbiz This Week,'' a spokeswoman, Christa Robinson, said. About 10 on-air staff members and 20 other jobs will be eliminated.
12/8/2001	Turnabout at AOL Time Warner	This week's announcement that Gerald Levin would relinquish the helm of AOL Time Warner next May surprised Wall Street and left many observers wondering what his departure signifies for the media giant. For the moment, at least, it looks as if the traditional content providers from the old Time Warner -- the magazine, movie, television, book and music divisions -- have gained the ascendancy over the upstart Internet entrepreneurs from America Online. After a decade on the job, Mr. Levin will be succeeded as chief executive officer by his hand-picked successor, Richard Parsons, a Time Warner veteran. Wall Street had viewed Robert Pittman, the former president of AOL who will remain the chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, as the heir apparent. This is a remarkable turnabout from the day two years ago when upstart AOL, whose shares had been inflated by the dot-com bubble, used its stock to acquire the nation's largest media conglomerate. The merger was heralded as a triumph of the so-called new economy over all things stodgy. Three thousand lost Nasdaq points later, the merger looks more like a matter of inspired timing by Stephen Case, America Online's founder and now AOL Time Warner's chairman, who clearly knew when to cash in his chips.
12/8/2001	AOL's Future Chief to Bring Washington Connections	Richard D. Parsons, the newly designated AOL Time Warner chief executive, has forged a reputation for being a politically gifted and gracefully diplomatic corporate advocate with exceptional Republican contacts. For AOL Time Warner this is no small thing. Washington is expected to be an important battlefield for the company in the coming months, on a range of issues that include cable television ownership limits, cable and broadcasting cross-ownership limits, and Internet access rules, among others. Mr. Parsons's contacts and persuasive charms will be important weapons in the AOL Time Warner arsenal, people inside and outside of the company say.

12/7/2001	2 Team Players Whose Teamwork Will Be Tested	In management style and personality, Richard D. Parsons, AOL Time Warner's soon-to-be chief executive, and Robert W. Pittman, the company's chief operating officer, are as different as AOL was from Time Warner, before the merger. Mr. Parsons is known as a collaborator who strokes egos as he solves problems and seeks consensus; Mr. Pittman is known as a smooth-talking consummate marketer and demanding manager who often cuts to the chase in seeking results.
12/7/2001	Music Unit And Movies Will Receive More Scrutiny	The change in management at AOL Time Warner is expected to put a new focus on its troubled music division and, to some extent, the Warner movie studio and New Line Films, top entertainment industry executives say. The move of Richard D. Parsons to chief executive and Robert W. Pittman to being the sole chief operating officer could translate into significant shifts over the long term in the entertainment arena. Mr. Pittman, who helped build the MTV network, as well as AOL, has gained knowledge about music and television over the years, and will now have direct responsibility for the company's entertainment assets. They had been part of Mr. Parsons's portfolio as one of the two operating officers.
12/7/2001	AOL's Problems Go Beyond Even Harry Potter's Magic	When America Online and Time Warner came together a year ago, their hopes were pegged to the magic of the Internet. Today the brightest spot for the company is the wizardry of Harry Potter. Of course, the long-term success or failure of the merger will rest on whether AOL Time Warner can find ways to profit from its unrivaled combination of print and television content with cable and online distribution.
12/6/2001	Fusing Old and New	Two years ago, when America Online, the cheeky Internet powerhouse, announced that it was buying Time Warner, the paragon of offline publishing and entertainment, it was seen as confirmation that new media had officially overpowered the old. Then the Internet boom imploded, and conventional wisdom celebrated the return of established media firms to dominating the consumption of culture.
12/6/2001	Once Again, On His Terms	It was another coup in a coup-filled career. When Time Warner announced in January 2000 that it was merging with the Internet giant America Online, many critics said that Time Warner's chief executive, Gerald M. Levin, had signed retirement papers.
12/6/2001	Managers Say Reshuffling at AOL Plays to the Strengths of the 2 Top Executives	As workers and executives throughout AOL Time Warner were absorbing the news today of the unexpected reshuffling that would make Richard D. Parsons the chief executive, many were considering whether the rise of another top official from the Time Warner side of the merger that created the company would mean good times for its content providers. ''He's been the guy overseeing the content,'' said Russell Schwartz, president of domestic marketing for New Line Cinema, one of the company's two movie studios, along with Warner Brothers. ''If he is, in fact, all about content, then I think that bodes well for everybody who's providing content.''
12/6/2001	AOL Time Warner Turns to a Diplomat	In choosing Richard Dean Parsons as its chief executive, AOL Time Warner entrusted its future to a diplomat, a leader who has traveled the halls of the White House and the sidewalks of 125th Street in Harlem -- not an imperious media chief or Internet visionary. So from his arrival as president at what was then Time Warner six years ago to his promotion to the top job yesterday, his advances in the world of media and entertainment, with scant previous experience, struck many as a surprise.
12/6/2001	AOL TIME WARNER GETS A NEW CHIEF AS LEVIN DEPARTS	The chief executive of the world's biggest media company, AOL Time Warner, surprised his company and his industry yesterday by announcing that he would retire in May. The executive, Gerald M. Levin, will be replaced by his hand-picked successor, Richard D. Parsons, who will face the daunting job of making a merger conceived in the soaring Internet economy come of age during an economic slump for old-line and online media companies alike. News of the handoff comes less than a year after America Online acquired Time Warner in a $165 billion deal that was supposed to have created a behemoth capable of exploiting the growth of the Internet while remaining a powerhouse in film, television and magazines.
12/5/2001	AOL Retreats From Big Push For E-Books	In the latest setback to the once-promising future of electronic books, the books division of AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it was cutting back its expensive line of digital books and laying off almost all 29 employees, citing a slump in sales of all books and especially digital ones. ''Perhaps Mr. Gutenberg has the last laugh here,'' said Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of the books division. He said the remaining electronic book publishing would be consolidated with the company's Warner Books and Little, Brown units.
12/4/2001	Market Place; Three giants square off in the bidding for the biggest cable prize of all, AT&T Broadband.	THREE of the nation's biggest cable companies lined up yesterday in hopes of taking over the largest one, AT&T Broadband, submitting complex bids that AT&T will begin reviewing in the coming days. And Microsoft, which is already a minority stakeholder in AT&T, has indicated that it will financially support competing bids for AT&T Broadband from both the Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications in an effort to keep it out of the hands of AOL Time Warner.
12/3/2001	Asian English-Language Journals Are Reeling as Advertising Slumps	English-language journalism in Asia has taken a body blow in the last month, with the closing of one Hong Kong-based regional news magazine and a drastic retrenchment at another. AOL Time Warner said on Thursday that it would stop publishing Asiaweek, which it has owned since 1985, because of the collapse of the advertising market here. Most of its 85 employees will lose their jobs.
12/3/2001	Suitors Line Up to Compete For Cable TV Unit at AT&T	The story of AT&T's cable television unit begins a new chapter this evening, when bids are due from competing suitors for the unit, the nation's largest cable operation. AOL Time Warner, Comcast and Cox Communications, which are each already among the nation's biggest cable companies, are all expected to submit formal bids. Microsoft, meanwhile, is expected to propose acquiring a minority stake, as it looks toward winning a captive market for its own software products.
11/29/2001	Time Inc. Said to Have Plans To Close 3 Small Magazines	Faced with a slowdown in advertiser spending, AOL Time Warner plans to close three of its smaller magazines -- Asiaweek, Family Life and On, which was formerly Time Digital, people close to the company said yesterday. A spokesman for Time Inc. declined to comment, but the company is expected to announce the closings today, the people close to the company said.

The products will be introduced in March throughout Asia and are expected to generate five billion yen ($41 million) in extra sales for Sanrio. The companies will co-design about 200 products for the Japanese character goods market. Hello Kitty, a mouthless cat popular with both toddlers and teenagers, generates about half of Sanrio's $1.2 billion in worldwide sales. Ken Belson (NYT)
11/15/2001	Boss on Cover Raises Issues For Magazine	When Fortune went searching for ''the smartest people we know'' to poll on the subject of the future, the magazine did not look too far in one case. The staff put its own boss, AOL Time Warner's chief executive Gerald M. Levin, on the list. And of the four people selected to appear on the cover of the magazine's current issue, Mr. Levin is there, along with the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company; and Bill Joy, chief scientist of Sun Microsystems.
11/13/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: AOL And Sony In Venture	AOL Time Warner and the Sony Corporation of Japan announced yesterday that they had agreed to cooperate to develop advanced digital entertainment technologies and services. The pact joins AOL, a large media company, with Sony, a big maker of electronic devices. The statement included few specifics, but perhaps the most intriguing aspect of yesterday's deal was the announcement that the companies intended to develop an Internet browser, posing a potential challenge to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. AOL controls Netscape, a browser pioneer that has lost ground to Microsoft. Seth Schiesel (NYT)
11/12/2001	Miscellany	* Taylor Nelson Sofres, London, which owns companies like CMR, the ad-spending tracking service, agreed to acquire TES, Los Angeles, composed of Theatrical Entertainment Services and RapidCheck Reporting, for an initial cash payment of $37.9 million and a maximum final price of $76 million. * The Chrysler Group, Auburn Hills, Mich., part of DaimlerChrysler, signed an agreement with AOL Time Warner, New York, for a multimedia advertising program carrying the theme ''Home for the Holidays.''

11/12/2001	Publisher to Sell Digital Books Online	Simon & Schuster announced last week that it would open its own online store to sell digital editions of its books directly to consumers, moving ahead with the plan despite scant demand to read such books.

Now they will have an opportunity to pay for and download electronic files for reading on a computer screen.
11/12/2001	Keepers (and Disbursers) of the Country's Sudden Generosity	AMERICANS wanted to do something, anything, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- and more often than not, that involved giving. The more than $1 billion in donations has inspired the country -- and stunned, and sometimes staggered, the charities that received the bounty. The people who run the charities and those who monitor them have found themselves in uncharted territory in their efforts to collect, spend and account for the money. Here is a brief introduction to some of those on the philanthropic frontlines. Larry Levy Founder TWIN TOWERS FUND It was a day or two after the attacks, Larry Levy said, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tapped him to lay the groundwork for a fund to benefit the families of uniformed workers who died on Sept. 11. Pressed as to why he was chosen, Mr. Levy, the mayor's time-tested and trusted deputy counsel, smiled in his basement office at City Hall and said, ''Maybe I was in the mayor's sightline when the subject came up.''
11/7/2001	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: AOL Deal Lifts Aether	A developer of software and services for wireless Internet access, Aether Systems, said it would sell a minority stake to AOL Time Warner and that the two companies would work together to develop and market Web and wireless services. Shares in Aether jumped on news of the deal, closing the day at $8.33, up $1.72, or 26 percent. Under the agreement, America Online will integrate its e-mail, instant messaging and other content into the Aether wireless products and services for small and medium-sized businesses. Aether will also create a wireless version of Netscape's Netbusiness service, which provides information and resources for small-business owners. Netscape is owned by AOL Time Warner.

10/30/2001	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Despite rising numbers of subscribers, there is some concern over AOL's revenue growth.	TO hear the chief executive, Gerald M. Levin, tell it, a main rationale for the multibillion-dollar merger that created AOL Time Warner was subscriptions: from Time Warner's magazine and cable businesses and from the America Online Internet juggernaut. But based on the company's latest financial report, some big investors and analysts are asking: ''Where's the growth?''
10/29/2001	AOL Gains Cable Rights in China by Omitting News, Sex and Violence	How did the world's biggest media company gain a foothold in the world's most populous country? For AOL Time Warner Inc., the answer, it seems, is, ''no sex, no violence, no news.'' Last Monday, AOL signed a deal with the Chinese government, allowing it to broadcast one of its cable channels in southern China. The agreement, under which AOL will expand its Mandarin-language channel, China Entertainment Television, into the mainland, is the first time a foreign broadcaster has won the right to distribute programming on cable television systems in China.

The group says it offers an alternative to government regulation. Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, applauded the efforts, but said parents should use sites like www.getnetwise.org to see the full range of options.

In return, the company will carry Chinese programming on its cable systems in New York, Los Angeles and Houston. The deal gives central government approval to Guangdong transmissions by the Hong Kong-based China Entertainment Television, or CETV, which AOL recently bought from its founder, Robert Chua, a Singapore producer. Some Guangdong cable systems already carry CETV with tacit approval from Beijing, but the formal approval will allow AOL to market the channel more aggressively.
10/18/2001	Online Downturn Means Drop for AOL Time Warner	When AOL and Time Warner merged in January, the combination was supposed to create synergies between the new media and the old. Yesterday, investors seemed to find that the new-media part of the marriage was not fulfilling its end of the bargain. Despite overall third-quarter results that met or exceeded analysts' expectations, America Online, the Internet unit of AOL Time Warner, fell far short of predictions, mainly because of softness in online advertising and electronic commerce. Investors seized on that weakness as they sent the company's shares down 8.03 percent, to $30.81 from $33.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
10/16/2001	U.S. Inquiry Is Under Way On Online Music Business	The Justice Department said yesterday that it was investigating whether the major recording companies were engaged in anticompetitive practices in the nascent online music market. The acknowledgment of the investigation came in the week after antitrust regulators had sent civil subpoenas to companies in the music industry to seek documents pertaining to the licensing of music for distribution over the Internet, including how royalties are being set, record industry officials said.
10/10/2001	Would-Be Raider of Blue-Chip Companies Is the Talk of Wall Street	Ade O. Ogunjobi, a college dropout who describes himself as an entrepreneur, wants to be the next great corporate raider. He may be just a joker. His Los Angeles-based company, Toks Inc., said yesterday that it planned to make tender offers for General Electric; AOL Time Warner; General Motors; the Hughes Electronics unit of G.M.; AT&T; AT&T Wireless; and Marriott International. The offers, which Toks valued at $2 trillion, were quickly declared a hoax by most of the companies. ''We're as mystified as anyone,'' said Toni Simonetti, a spokeswoman for General Motors. ''It seems pretty far out on the edge.''
10/9/2001	Best Buy Starts Site For Music on Web	The Best Buy Company, the largest electronics retailer, said today that its BestBuy.com Internet division has started a Web site that allows users to purchase music online by downloading digital files. The site features music from the record labels of the EMI Group, AOL Time Warner and the BMG unit of Bertelsmann. Best Buy hopes to add other record labels, said David Witzig, BestBuy.com's director of digital entertainment media and services.
9/27/2001	THE MARKETS: Market Place; What's Eating Those Giant Media Stocks?	The stocks of almost all major media companies have fallen since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But some are down more than others, and one -- Vivendi Universal -- has even risen. Why have different media companies fared differently, and why is the outlook for some of them shakier than for others?
9/27/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: MusicNet Says Technology Is In Place	MusicNet, a joint venture backed by three major record labels that plans to sell music over the Internet, said it had completed the technological foundation of its service. Richard Wolpert, left, a board member of MusicNet, said a preview of its service would be offered for journalists and industry analysts next week. But the public unveiling of the product could be two months away, MusicNet officials said. The company, which had planned to begin a service by the end of the summer, insisted it had met its revised timetable. MusicNet, which is backed by AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann and the EMI Group, as well as RealNetworks, said it had designed a basic template that Internet sites can use to sell music for download on a subscription basis, though the price and structure of the service remain unspecified. Matt Richtel (NYT)
9/25/2001	AOL, Blaming Terrorist Attacks, Says It Will Fall Far Short of Its Goals	AOL Time Warner Inc., the world's biggest media company, announced yesterday that it would badly miss its financial goals for the year, largely because the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks exacerbated the erosion of the advertising market. Ever since America Online agreed to acquire Time Warner early last year, executives from the companies have trumpeted their relative independence from advertising.
9/11/2001	If AT&T Cuts a Cable Deal, Will AOL Cut In?	In the wake of Comcast's unsolicited offer in July for its cable business, AT&T may indeed welcome AOL Time Warner's making a bid now. But AOL Time Warner's expression of interest in buying 40 percent of the telephone giant's 14 million cable subscribers does not necessarily signal a bidding war, several industry experts said yesterday. For one thing, AOL Time Warner has not yet presented AT&T with a specific bid, as Comcast did when it offered $44.5 billion for 49 percent of AT&T Broadband. There were simply reports, which AOL Time Warner did not deny, that it was interested in a deal.
9/10/2001	AOL Time Warner Said to Be Pursuing AT&T's Cable Unit	In an effort to become the nation's largest cable operator, AOL Time Warner proposed late last week to merge its cable operations with AT&T's, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday. While AOL has not yet made a formal merger offer for AT&T's cable business, which is called AT&T Broadband, the proposal is the first signal that AOL is earnestly pursuing a deal.
9/5/2001	Western TV May Be Nearer For Chinese	After a series of meetings with top-level Chinese officials, AOL Time Warner and the News Corporation said yesterday that they had moved closer to a long-sought goal of receiving permission from the Chinese government to broadcast their television programs in China. An AOL Time Warner executive, Edward Adler, said that his company and the News Corporation had held ''positive and constructive discussions as recently as last week'' with Chinese officials to try to overcome their reluctance to formally sanction broadcasts by foreign companies.
8/29/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: AOL Enters Deal With H&R Block	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it had selected H&R Block to be the exclusive provider of tax preparation services and tax advice within AOL's Tax Center and in Compuserve. The expanded Tax Center will include H&R Block's Online Tax Program, access to the services of a tax professional and H&R's ''Ask a Tax Advisor'' service. Previously, AOL, based in Dulles, Va., had an exclusive agreement with Intuit to provide tax preparation services. As part of the agreement, H&R Block, of Kansas City, Mo., will also market its services across AOL's brands, which now include Time, People and Fortune magazines as well as the TNT and CNN television networks. Also as part of the deal, H&R Block will also offer the AOL online service to its tax clients. AOL officials declined to provide financial terms. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
8/25/2001	CENDANT PREDICTS MARKETING DEAL WILL HELP NEXT YEAR	The Cendant Corporation said yesterday that it expected its 2002 earnings to benefit from a marketing agreement between its Trilegiant Corporation affiliate and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner. In early July, the former management of Cendant's membership services and loyalty units formed Trilegiant. Cendant bought $20 million in preferred shares, equal to a 20 percent equity stake, and committed $100 million in cash for marketing. As part of a 40-year agreement, Cendant will outsource its membership business to Trilegiant, in return for 5 percent of the affiliate's revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2002.
8/21/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: An Album Debut On AOL Site	Weeks before its retail release, an eagerly awaited album had its debut yesterday on Spinner.com, an Internet music service owned by AOL Time Warner. The unusual move for the recording industry involved the album ''Get Ready'' from the British synth-pop band New Order. It is scheduled for release in stores Oct. 16. Recording companies have avoided releasing early versions on the Internet, fearing that they would hurt sales and encourage piracy. As part of the release on Spinner.com, the album is being streamed in its entirety from Aug. 20 through Aug. 27. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
8/18/2001	MARKETING GROUP CREATED TO LIFT ADVERTISING SALES	AOL Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that it had created a marketing group to increase sales of advertising across all of its businesses, including the Internet service America Online and People magazine. The unit, AOL Time Warner Global Marketing Solutions, will be led by Myer Berlow, said a spokeswoman, Wendy Goldberg. Mr. Berlow, 51, is a former president of America Online's worldwide interactive marketing. Cross-marketing agreements may help the company offset the recent decline in advertising growth that has affected many Web sites, television stations and magazines.
8/17/2001	Time Warner Cable Chief To Run Interactive TV Unit	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that Joseph J. Collins would leave his post as chief executive of the company's Time Warner Cable division to run a unit to develop interactive television services. Mr. Collins will report directly to Gerald M. Levin, AOL's chief executive, the first time Mr. Levin has directly supervised a business unit since Time Warner, which he led, merged with America Online at the beginning of the year. Mr. Collins had reported to Robert W. Pittman, co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner. Mr. Levin did not have any business units, other than the merged company's investment arm, reporting directly to him.
8/16/2001	Technology Briefing | Hardware: AOL Alters Pager Pricing	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it had reduced the price of its America Online e-mail pager to $99.95 from $329.95, but raised the monthly access fee $10, to $29.95. The company also said it had revamped its AOL Mobile Communicator software to display e-mail messages faster, allow customization of ''away notices'' and better notify users of low-coverage areas. By cutting the price of its pagers by more than two-thirds, the company hopes to win customers for its AOL Anywhere products. AOL's device is made by Research in Motion Ltd., whose Blackberry pagers are popular with business users. The research firm Jupiter Media Metrix has forecast that 96 million United States consumers in 2005 will connect to the Web through cell phones and other wireless devices, up from 4.1 million last year. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
8/15/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Analyst Cuts AOL Forecast	An analyst said AOL Time Warner was unlikely to meet its 2001 financial targets because of an ''overall weak advertising market.'' Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who was one of the first analysts to promote Internet stocks, cut her estimate for AOL's 2001 revenue to $39 billion from $39.5 billion and for cash flow to $10.5 billion from $11 billion.
8/15/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay Extends Pact With AOL	EBay, the online auctioneer, and AOL Time Warner said the two companies would expand AOL's promotion of eBay and extend the alliance for three more years. AOL, based in Dulles, Va., has promoted eBay through its online service for several years, but AOL's merger with Time Warner gave the company a range of new advertising opportunities, including Fortune, Time and People magazines and the cable TV channels TNT and CNN. The announcement comes six months after eBay struck a similar deal with Microsoft to promote the auction service on its online properties. EBay paid AOL $75 million in 1999; the companies would not disclose the financial terms of the current deal. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
8/14/2001	Comcast Said To Be Talking Of Side Deals In AT&T Fight	The Comcast Corporation, in its effort to acquire AT&T's cable television business, has held exploratory talks with AOL Time Warner and other potential rival suitors that could effectively stave off competing bids, according to several executives close to the discussions. The executives said Comcast and AOL Time Warner, for example, have discussed the possibility of a deal that could make it easy for AOL Time Warner to buy the 25 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment that AT&T owns, if Comcast wins control of the AT&T cable business. AOL Time Warner has been stalled for months in negotiations to buy the 25 percent stake directly from AT&T.
8/9/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Loss Widens At AOL Latin America	The second-quarter loss by America Online Latin America rose 51 percent from the period a year earlier, though it came in below analysts' forecasts. The company, a joint venture of AOL Time Warner and Venezuela's Cisneros Group, said it had lost $70.4 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with $46.7 million in last year's second quarter. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call were expecting a 28-cent loss. Although AOL Latin America quadrupled its revenue and added 238,000 new members in the quarter, sharply higher spending on sales and marketing hurt the company's bottom line. Shares fell 44 cents, to close at $5.34. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
8/9/2001	CNN Studios Get Down to Rivals' Level: Midtown Streets	Hoping to capture some of the street-theater energy that the major television networks get from their Midtown Manhattan operations, CNN plans to open two studios on the ground level of the historic Time & Life Building on the Avenue of the Americas, officials involved in the plans said yesterday. If the CNN move succeeds, it will give every major television news network a ground-level beachhead in Midtown, something that NBC popularized in the mid-1990's when its ''Today'' show roared back to the top of the ratings after opening its ground-floor studio at Rockefeller Center.
8/7/2001	Plans to Sell Music on the Internet Raise Antitrust Concerns	The efforts of five major record companies to join forces and sell music over the Internet have received increasing attention from regulators and legislators who want to make sure the companies do not engage in anticompetitive behavior. In the latest development, the Justice Department, which oversees antitrust investigations, has contacted several of the companies, people close to the companies said today.
8/6/2001	MediaTalk; Publisher Auditions an Online Farm Team	In a twist on the scramble to sell electronic books, the publishing division of AOL Time Warner is using digital publishing as a kind of farm team for its traditional print business. AOL Time Warner is publishing three electronic books, available for downloading and reading on a screen, by little-known authors who submitted manuscripts to its Web site, iPublish.com. All three will also be available on request as paperbacks, made to order in small batches with special machines.
8/3/2001	AOL Time Warner Reverses Itself on Cable Shift After Pressure by NBC	After deciding to move the financial news network CNBC to a less desirable, higher-numbered cable channel in New York City, AOL Time Warner reversed itself yesterday afternoon under pressure from NBC. Time Warner Cable of New York City, a division of AOL Time Warner, sent a letter to its 1.1 million customers in the city last week saying that it would move CNBC to Channel 64 from Channel 15 on Sept. 5. That raised antitrust concerns because the network would have been further back in the rotation than its chief rival, CNNfn, on Channel 27, which is owned by AOL Time Warner.
8/1/2001	F.T.C. Is Acting In 3 Tenors' Case	In ''Mitridate, Re di Ponto,'' one of Mozart's early operas, the king of Pontus realizes that his two sons are plotting against him and sings an aria vowing to seek revenge, or at least justice. While no king, the Federal Trade Commission had something similar to say yesterday about two companies under its regulatory purview, AOL Time Warner and Vivendi Universal of France.
7/25/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Zomba Invests In Musicnet	Zomba, an independent record label, said yesterday that it had made an equity investment in MusicNet, the online music service backed by three major record labels. Under the partnership, Zomba said it would license to MusicNet content from its seven labels, including its flagship label, Jive Records. Terms were not disclosed. MusicNet -- a venture of EMI Recorded Music, BMG Entertainment, AOL Time Warner and RealNetworks -- is creating a service to sell music over the Internet. The companies plan to start the service by the end of the summer. Matt Richtel (NYT)
7/25/2001	IN AMAZON'S STOCK SALE TO AOL, A CLAUSE ABOUT TAKEOVER	Amazon.com, in agreeing to sell $100 million of stock to America Online, included a provision that lets AOL propose a takeover of the company, the world's largest Internet retailer. The contract, filed with the S.E.C., includes provisions that bar AOL, a unit of AOL Time Warner, from increasing its stake in Amazon.com or seeking board control. Such ''standstill'' provisions are often included in investment agreements. Less common was a caveat to the standstill restrictions that permits AOL to suggest an ''extraordinary transaction'' with Amazon.com, as long as the talks can be kept confidential.
7/23/2001	Disney Is Said To Be Close To Acquisition Of Fox Family	In a deal intended to make the Walt Disney Company a stronger force in the lucrative cable programming business, Disney is close to an agreement to buy Fox Family Worldwide from the News Corporation and its partner for $3.2 billion in cash, people close to the deal said yesterday. The agreement, which is expected to be announced as early as today, would add a network with 81 million subscribers in the United States, 24 million in Europe and 10 million in Latin America to Disney's cable operations, which include the Disney Channel, Toon Disney, SoapNet and ESPN, along with stakes in Lifetime, A&E and E! Entertainment. Acquisition of the Fox Family channel would strengthen Disney's influence with younger audiences, give it another outlet for its existing programming as well as expand the Disney brand name overseas.
7/19/2001	AOL Time Warner Posts Mixed Results in Quarter	In an economic storm, AOL Time Warner Inc. has labored mightily to remain on course. But for all of its helmsmanship, it may be difficult for the company to reach its desired financial destination for this year. That was essentially the message from the second-quarter results AOL Time Warner announced yesterday. The company's aggressive cost-cutting and relentless pursuit of synergies between Time Warner and the old America Online contributed to higher profit margins in crucial units and a lower overall loss than the company suffered a year ago.
1/2/2014	AT&T Is Said to Be Open to Courtship of Its Cable Television Unit	Despite AT&T's recent public statements that its cable television business is ''not for sale,'' AT&T is not only amenable to selling the unit under the right conditions but is actively considering and perhaps even soliciting potential deals, people close to the company say. In fact, on July 7, the day before the Comcast Corporation formally made its unsolicited $44.5 billion bid to acquire the unit, C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chairman, was in Atlanta discussing a potential deal with Cox Communications, the nation's No. 5 cable company, according to people close to the talks. Cox declined to make a deal, these people said. Mr. Armstrong suspected that Comcast might make a bid soon, the people said.
7/15/2001	Mix, Patch, Promote and Lift; A Showman Speeds the Makeover of Ted Turner's Empire	JAMIE KELLNER sat back and gazed out the window as the Gulfstream V corporate jet began its gentle glide into this city, his new home. Down below, a billowy carpet of green trees and brush was broken up by a glassy lake. ''I didn't know there was water there,'' he said. Mr. Kellner, who was looking for a place to live, paused, then added, ''I wonder how I get a piece of that.'' Mr. Kellner, who at 54 is square-jawed and street tough even though he now lives luxuriously, was talking real estate.
7/11/2001	N.F.L.'s Internet Deal Will Be Largest Ever	The National Football League, which has the largest television deal in sports, will announce the biggest league Internet rights deal today. The league is to get an estimated $110 million in cash and at least $200 million in noncash value over five years from a consortium of AOL Time Warner, Sportsline.com and Viacom, an N.F.L. executive said.
6/30/2001	Microsoft Case Back in Play, And the Lobbying Heats Up	As federal and state prosecutors ponder what to do next with Microsoft, they have already come under enormous lobbying pressure from the company to settle quickly and from its rivals, most notably AOL Time Warner, to continue litigating. The lobbying campaign was in full swing even before Thursday's decision by a federal court of appeals here, which vacated the order to break up Microsoft but also found that the company had engaged in a raft of anticompetitive practices in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. It is now expected to intensify and to become, for the city's cadre of lawyers and lobbyists, one of the most lucrative fights of the year.
6/29/2001	AOL TIME WARNER TO INVEST IN MINORITY-RUN BUSINESSES	AOL Time Warner, the media and Internet company, plans to invest about $100 million for three years in companies owned or managed by minorities and women. The AOL Time Warner Opportunity Investment Fund will invest in companies, with senior managers representing minority groups, that focus on underserved markets with businesses that fit with those of AOL Time Warner, a spokesman, Ed Adler, said. Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive, has said he wants AOL Time Warner to be a leader in promoting diversity in business and the workplace.
6/28/2001	WebMD Executive Moves to AOL Time Warner	Not long ago, it sometimes seemed as if every executive from traditional media who could was finding a way into cyberspace. Now, it sometimes seems as if every one of those executives who can is finding a way back. Add Patricia Fili-Krushel to the list.
6/22/2001	Emap of Britain Draws Bids In Sale of U.S. Magazines	Emap, the British publishing company, received formal bids -- the largest slightly more than $550 million -- for its United States magazine business yesterday, including titles like Motor Trend and Teen, executives close to the auction said. The bidders included American Media, which publishes The National Enquirer; Primedia, which publishes Seventeen and New York magazine; AOL Time Warner; and the Texas Pacific Group, an investment firm with holdings ranging from J. Crew to Oxford Health Plans, the executives said.
6/21/2001	Online Maps for Here, There and Everywhere	THANKS to the Internet, a man can now engage in the most embarrassing of all activities in the privacy of his own home: asking for directions. Web-based map services are feature-rich successors to the simple but venerable paper TripTik introduced by the American Automobile Association in 1932. But unlike their printed counterparts, online mapping services can generate customizable point-to-point driving directions, plotting routes that favor the shortest distance, the shortest driving time, the most direct route or even particular roads. Of course, these services may not always be capable of providing a driver with a particular favored route.
6/21/2001	Is There Life After AOL	AN overprotective parent. Comfortable old shoes or pajamas. A bad marriage. People who subscribe to America Online, America's largest Internet service provider, use a variety of metaphors to describe their feelings about it. Like McDonald's, the fast food purveyor that people love to hate, AOL has many ambivalent customers. ''What surprises me is that so many people use AOL but no one seems to like it,'' said Rose Miller, a potter in Sandia Park, N.M. ''A lot of people complain about it.''
6/21/2001	MUSIC COMPANIES SEEK LIQUIDATION OF NATIONAL RECORD	National Record Mart, a music retailer, said yesterday that it had been forced into bankruptcy court by suppliers, including the music units of Vivendi Universal and the Sony Corporation, to which it owes $18.7 million. National Record, based in Carnegie, Pa., said five music distributors asked the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh to liquidate the company to pay for compact discs, tapes and albums supplied by the music units of Vivendi, Sony, Bertelsmann EMI Group and AOL Time Warner. National Record said the filing came during a restructuring of the 131-store chain, which operates under the names National Record Mart, NRM Music, Waves Music, Music Oasis, Vibes Music and Music X. The company has 20 days to respond.
6/18/2001	AOL and IPC Break Off Talks on Deal	Talks between AOL Time Warner and IPC Media Ltd., a British magazine publisher, have broken down after the two companies could not agree on a price, people close to the discussions said today. AOL Time Warner had been holding intermittent discussions with IPC for months, these people said. But the discussions stalled recently after IPC and its largest shareholder, the private equity firm Cinven, deemed a price of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion inadequate.
6/18/2001	A Growing Rivalry Derails AOL Talks For Microsoft Deal	The collapse of talks between Microsoft and AOL Time Warner this weekend was rooted in Microsoft's strategy of making its new operating system the tool to provide a wide range of tightly integrated services directly to computer users, an area AOL has dominated for years. The dispute, over how their software would be combined, shows how rivalry in the computer industry has shifted from individual pieces of software, like Web browsers, to control over whole systems that govern how consumers use computers.
6/17/2001	Break in Talks Between AOL And Microsoft	Negotiations between AOL Time Warner and Microsoft abruptly ended yesterday after the two sides could not agree on the issue of AOL's strategic partnership with RealNetworks, a Microsoft competitor. The two sides have been negotiating a variety of issues, including whether AOL will use Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, the cooperation of the two companies' instant messaging systems and Microsoft's desire for AOL to include its media player, which competes with RealNetworks's RealPlayer.
6/15/2001	Technology Briefing | People: AOL Names Global Policy Chief	AOL Time Warner named Robert M. Kimmitt executive vice president for global and strategic policy, effective on July 1. The company said Mr. Kimmitt, who was president of Commerce One Inc., would become a member of AOL's executive committee. He replaces George Vradenburg, who will now serve as an adviser to the company.
6/14/2001	Messengers That Carry Big Bundles	THE first time I heard of an instant message was in 1994, when an old friend suggested that we stop blasting e-mail back and forth across America Online and have a proper online chat. The next night, when I booted up my Mac at the agreed hour and signed on to AOL, a tiny window popped up so my friend could say, ''Hey.'' We proceeded to spend two hours, he in Iowa and I in New York, in what can only be called a state of Intense I.M. Seven years later, with Internet connections as necessary as food, coffee and ''Sex and the City'' boxed sets for many people, much of the online world seems to be in a state of Intense I.M. Several free instant-message programs from competing companies have appeared. But one thing hamstringing a full-blown communications revolution is that the people using one service generally find it impossible to exchange instant messages with people on other systems. (And that is a big problem -- imagine how popular e-mail would be if people had to have the same Internet service provider to communicate.) There is a movement afoot to create a fully interoperable instant-message system, but for now, the services are still essentially walled off.
6/12/2001	AOL Joins Chinese Venture, Gaining a Crucial Foothold	AOL Time Warner said today that it was teaming with Legend Holdings, China's largest computer maker, in a joint venture to develop interactive services for what many people say will one day be the world's largest Internet market. ''This joint venture is a concrete demonstration of our strategic commitment to work with China to fully develop this exciting medium,'' Gerald M. Levin, AOL's chief executive, said in Beijing. Legend's chairman, Liu Chuanzhi, said the deal would ''have a profound impact on the China Internet industry.''
6/11/2001	MediaTalk; The Executive Author Confronts Corporate Sprawl	Like other moguls in an era of intertwined alliances among media conglomerates, John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric, faces some delicate decisions about the publication of his memoirs: how to promote his book without doing too many favors for his company's competition. Mr. Welch sold the right to publish his book to AOL Time Warner's book publishing division for a near-record advance of $7.1 million, and AOL Time Warner plans to spend $1 million more on a barrage of promotions, including many involving AOL Time Warner's other businesses, like the magazines Time and Fortune, the America Online service and CNN.
6/11/2001	Magazine for Teenagers Benefits in Publishing-Internet Marriage	If you do not know who Lil Bow Wow is, or that Uncle Kracker is Kid Rock's D.J., or to whom Enrique Iglesias dedicated his first solo album, or why that cute girl in gym class will not talk to you anymore, you are probably not a reader of Teen People, or its Web twin, TeenPeople.com. But millions of teenagers are readers of the print version -- over 1.6 million buy it, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, and they share it with their friends. And Anne Zehren, the publisher of the magazine, said that 65 percent of the visitors to TeenPeople.com come through the magazine's corporate cousin AOL, part of the AOL Time Warner ménage that also includes Teen People.
6/11/2001	Planning the Digital Smorgasbord	Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive of AOL Time Warner, is not an effusive man. To begin a recent interview at the company's Manhattan headquarters, he was asked about his company's vision. ''Subscriptions,'' he said. Full stop. Asked, gingerly, about the sorts of subscriptions he had in mind, he responded simply.
6/8/2001	AOL Will Merge Magazines After Buying Business 2.0	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Business 2.0, the ailing new-economy magazine, and merge it with its eCompany Now magazine. AOL agreed to pay the Future Network, Business 2.0's owner, $68 million and 25 percent of the annual revenue of the combined magazine that exceeds $50 million for six years. Future Network will also receive 25 percent of the revenue from the magazine's Internet site and conference division that exceeds $10 million.
6/5/2001	Napster Is Said to Be Near Accord on Music Sales	The online song-swapping service Napster is close to an agreement for permission to use music from three of the major record companies in a pay version of its service, according to people close to the situation. Terms of the proposed agreement remain unclear and some obstacles remained to be worked out last night. The proposed deal would not affect a lawsuit the music industry filed accusing Napster of abetting copyright infringement, nor would it alter a preliminary injunction crippling Napster's service by forcing it to block traffic in copyrighted songs. The three record companies -- AOL Time Warner's Warner Music, Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment and EMI Group -- would retain the right to cancel the deal if Napster fails to meet certain security standards.
6/4/2001	MediaTalk; A Time Inc. Institution Will Close Its Doors	The cost-cutting at AOL Time Warner continues, and last week it hacked at what some long-term editors and reporters at Time Inc. had thought of as the very marrow of the company. Until last week, Time Inc.'s editorial research library -- a huge collection of volumes and archived clippings that occupies a floor and a half at the Time-Life Building, plus extensive warehouse space -- employed three dozen librarians and staff.
6/4/2001	Now Meet Jack Welch The Scribe	John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric, said he was not trying to sell his forthcoming memoirs when he made his public debut as an author at BookExpo, the annual book industry convention, here on Friday. He was just being himself. But if so, he appears to take to selling books naturally. ''If he wasn't trying to sell, he sure was succeeding,'' said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chairman of the book division of AOL Time Warner, which paid a record advance of $7.1 million last year for the North American rights to Mr. Welch's book and threw a party in the Sears Tower here to start a big promotional campaign. Mr. Kirshbaum said the publishing house had received orders for more than 100,000 additional copies the next day. The book, ''Jack: Straight From the Gut,'' written with John A. Byrne of Business Week magazine, is scheduled for publication in September.
5/25/2001	New Suit Filed To Bar Trading Music on Net	Continuing their legal attack on Internet companies that they say are stealing their music, the major recording companies filed a copyright infringement lawsuit yesterday against Aimster, a service that permits users of instant messaging services to exchange music and other files. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, asserts that Aimster aids copyright infringement by permitting users to exchange copyrighted music files freely over the Internet.
5/23/2001	World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Getting Better At EMI	Buoyed by sales of a top-selling Beatles compilation, the EMI Group, the world's No. 3 music company, said it had increased market share in the United States and around the world, positioning itself as a stand-alone business after failed mergers with AOL Time Warner and Bertelsmann. EMI said global market share was up 1.6 percentage points, to 14.1 percent, and its slice of the United States market had grown to 10.8 percent from 9 percent, gains ascribed by the company in part to the sale of 23 million copies of the Beatles 1 compilation. Full-year pretax adjusted profit rose 5.7 percent, to $373 million, but net income was down 48 percent, to $118 million, because of the costs of its failed merger with AOL Time Warner, the company said.

5/20/2001	A New Colossus Begins to Rise	IT HAS TAKEN twice as long to redevelop the site of the New York Coliseum -- 16 years and counting -- as it took the Romans to build the original. But today, fresh steel columns are finally sprouting on Columbus Circle where the Coliseum once stood. At a distance, they look like wispy tendrils, dwarfed within a 3.4-acre concrete bathtub 33 feet deep and 630 feet from corner to corner. ''There are very few guys who could hit a baseball out of this,'' said Michael Marrone, the general superintendent for the construction manager, Bovis Lend Lease.
5/20/2001	Business; For Warner Music, Online Opportunities	THE headquarters of Warner Brothers Records, home to Madonna and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, could symbolize the troubled company's fate. Designed in the mid-1970's by a trend-setting West Coast architect, the building, in Burbank, Calif., once echoed Warner's huge success as an artist-friendly label. Now it is known derisively as the ski chalet or the country club to its critics -- including Roger Ames, head of the Warner Music Group, the AOL Time Warner unit that includes the Warner Brothers, Atlantic and Elektra labels. ''The building is irrelevant,'' said Mr. Ames, 51, a veteran music executive hired by Warner in 1999. ''My view is you can sign an artist on a park bench.''
5/19/2001	AOL TIME WARNER AGREES TO ACQUIRE INFOINTERACTIVE	AOL Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy InfoInterActive Inc. of Canada for $28.2 million to gain software that alerts people that they have a phone call while they are on the Internet. AOL Time Warner, based in New York, will pay 2.18 Canadian dollars ($1.42) for each InfoInterActive share, the company said. The price is a 45 percent premium to Thursday's closing share price of 1.50 Canadian dollars. InfoInterActive, based in Bedford, Nova Scotia, provides a service to phone companies known as Internet Call Manager. Its customers include Verizon Communications Inc.
5/18/2001	Metro Business Briefing | No Tax Breaks For AOL Building	The AOL Time Warner Center, a $1.7 billion mixed-use project under construction at Columbus Circle, will not qualify for tax breaks, the City Finance Department determined yesterday. The developers of the overall project, Stephen M. Ross, Kenneth A. Himmel and William L. Mack, said at the outset that they would not seek abatements. But AOL Time Warner, whose headquarters and studios will occupy about one-third of the 2.8-million-square-foot structure, was exploring the possibility. In a letter informing the company that the project would not qualify, the director of property tax exemptions, Warren Hyman, cited an earlier agreement between the city and the owners ''prohibiting any otherwise eligible applicant from seeking or taking advantage of any as-of-right real estate tax exemption, abatement or incentive program.''

5/18/2001	AOL Reorganization to Cost $965 Million	AOL Time Warner estimates that the cost of reorganizing its merged businesses will be about $965 million, with more than half from job cuts, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing says. About $565 million is for eliminating jobs, and about $400 million is for canceling leases and other contracts, the company said.
5/17/2001	Congress to Preview Digital Music Service	Music fans are expected to get their first glimpse of a major, and legal, online music subscription service today, as Congress convenes its third set of hearings in less than a year on the future of digital music. And in a sign of how rapidly the players are shifting in the fledgling industry, Napster, the song-swapping renegade whose popularity originally prompted Congress's interest in prodding the record industry to come up with legal alternatives to it, was not invited.
5/16/2001	Cultures Clash as AOL Switches to Its E-Mail	The uniting of America Online and Time Warner has caused more than a few changes in corporate culture, but one that has caused particularly loud grumbling among employees involves three words that are usually welcomed by AOL subscribers: ''You've Got Mail.'' AOL Time Warner is in the process of switching all employees to America Online as their primary corporate e-mail program, and not everyone is happy about the change.
5/15/2001	Sony and AOL Join Forces On the Video Game Front	Moving to create a strategic alliance against Microsoft, Sony Computer Entertainment and America Online plan to announce a new relationship on Tuesday aimed at blending the video game and online Internet experience. The new relationship comes as the video game industry prepares for its annual trade show, where the three major entrants -- Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft -- are jostling to capture mind-share from both software developers and consumers. The show begins on Wednesday in Los Angeles.
5/14/2001	MediaTalk; News Executives Playing the China Card	Pity Walter Isaacson, the editorial director of Time Inc. He arrived here last Tuesday after a long flight from New York -- granted, by corporate jet -- and quickly found himself in a ticklish situation. Mr. Isaacson had come for the Fortune Global Forum, an annual gathering of corporate chiefs and a token world leader or two. The forum is sponsored by Fortune magazine and its publisher, AOL Time Warner, which also owns Time magazine.
5/10/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: ICQ Reaches 100 Million Members	ICQ, the popular instant-messaging service owned by AOL Time Warner, said it had reached 100 million registered users worldwide. Since its acquisition by AOL in 1998, ICQ's user base has grown tenfold; two-thirds of its users live outside the United States. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
5/6/2001	China's Ban Of Magazine Clouds Forum In Hong Kong	Next week, the president of China, former President Bill Clinton and a full complement of corporate titans will gather here for a conference sponsored by Fortune magazine. But for the publisher of Fortune, AOL Time Warner, it will be another high-profile China conference marred by the muzzling of its flagship magazine, Time. Beijing has banned newsstand sales of Time since early March, 10 days after the magazine published an article on the Falun Gong spiritual movement in Hong Kong, the magazine's Asian editor said. Falun Gong was outlawed in China in 1999, but remains legal here.
5/6/2001	MapQuest Issues Atlas With Online Component	The traditional road atlas -- especially one for an area as large as North America -- presents mapmakers with quite a challenge: divining where its users want to go, where they're starting out from and what level of detail they want. Fully aware of these limitations, which competitors have dealt with as well, MapQuest.com and AOL Digital City have issued a 144-page road atlas for the United States, Canada and Mexico. Unlike similar atlases for North America -- Rand McNally's and the AAA's, for example -- this one is linked to an Internet counterpart. Increasingly, print and electronic versions are being integrated.
4/30/2001	AOL Time Warner Said to Seek Pact With British Cable Provider	AOL Time Warner has approached NTL, Britain's largest provider of cable television, about forming a distribution alliance, people close to the companies said today. The companies are discussing a marketing agreement that would give AOL Time Warner access to NTL's networks and permit it to share revenue from broadband customers in exchange for its content. But AOL Time Warner would not invest in NTL, these people said.
4/28/2001	Just Ask Elmo: Is 'B' for Bite, or Byte?	To the Editor: Gail Collins complains about AOL Time Warner's sponsorship of ''Sesame Street'' (column, April 24). But there's a weakness in the argument about blurring boundaries between corporate media and education. Ms. Collins asks if Elmo's computer fixation is really product placement, without acknowledging the contribution of ''Sesame Street'' in helping children and their parents appreciate how the ''knowledge economy'' has made computer competence essential.
4/25/2001	Big Media Is Both Big And Vulnerable; Interlocking Relationships Mean Everyone Can Be at Risk	With a strike deadline looming in Hollywood next week, the major film and television studios are presenting a united front against the writers, who are demanding higher ''residuals'' -- money from the subsequent use of the films and TV shows for which they have written scripts. Despite the show of unity by the studios, and the fact that they are owned by powerful media conglomerates like AOL Time Warner, the News Corporation and Viacom, the companies are not eager to take a hard line against the Writers Guild of America. Within each big media company, and among the companies, there are simply too many interlocking pieces and meshing gears for the studios to risk a long strike by the writers.
4/23/2001	Time Inc. Staff Adjusts Warily to Life Within AOL	Norman Pearlstine opened his speech at a private lunch last month for Time Inc. journalists with a joke. The occasion was the Henry R. Luce awards, in-house prizes given to the magazine's reporters and editors. Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive of AOL Time Warner, praised Time Inc.'s journalism in a rousing and confident talk. Then Mr. Pearlstine, Time Inc.'s editor in chief, gave his speech.
4/21/2001	'Buffy,' Moving to UPN, Tries to Be WB Slayer	In a rare case of a hit show leaving one broadcast network for another, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' a program that was crucial to the original success of the WB network, will move to UPN, its fiercest rival. The move could prove to be a real blow to the WB network, owned by AOL Time Warner, and could be a boon to UPN, which is owned by Viacom Inc. and has struggled some to gain a solid foothold in prime time.
4/19/2001	Losses Narrow As AOL Posts Higher Revenue	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that its revenue for the first three months grew strongly and that its losses narrowed as its AOL and cable businesses prospered despite fears that an economic slowdown would bring cutbacks in advertising and hinder subscriber growth. AOL, in particular, reported strong growth in subscribers, subscriber use and advertising, even as other Internet businesses struggled.
4/16/2001	Studios Take a Branding Cue From Consumer Products Giants	In pursuing a strategy to encourage consumers to buy DVD's rather than rent them, AOL Time Warner is borrowing a page from marketers of packaged goods like Procter & Gamble: add more brands to help snag more shelf space. The New Line Home Video division of New Line Cinema, the AOL Time Warner film studio known for releases like the ''Austin Powers'' movies, ''The Mask,'' ''Rush Hour'' and ''Boogie Nights,'' is introducing a DVD brand named Infinifilm. The discs will be sold in addition to the DVD's peddled under current New Line brands like New Line Platinum Edition.
4/3/2001	New Venture To Seek Fees For Net Music	Three of the world's largest record companies said today that they had struck a deal with RealNetworks, the Seattle-based Internet audio and video distribution company, to make music available online based on a subscription model. The announcement by Bertelsmann A.G., the EMI Group, AOL Time Warner and RealNetworks occurred after the music industry had spent months asserting it would move toward a subscription model. Today's agreement would have the music companies take minority positions in a company called MusicNet that was created last year by RealNetworks.
3/30/2001	Executive Named to Head Apollo Theater	Derek Q. Johnson, a top executive of AOL Time Warner, was named president of the Apollo Theater yesterday, solidifying the entertainment conglomerate's control of the troubled Harlem landmark. Mr. Johnson, 40, said yesterday that he would step down as an AOL Time Warner senior vice president to assume his new post.
3/26/2001	AOL Weighs Music Channel To Rival Viacom Networks	Viacom may soon face a formidable rival to its MTV and VH1 cable music networks, which have yet to face any real competition. AOL Time Warner is contemplating a new cable music network to compete with those of Viacom, company executives said earlier this month.
3/24/2001	Smackdown! W.W.F. to Buy Wrestling Rival	Smackdown! Ted Turner's wrestling career is over. In what may be the ultimate plot twist in wrestling's ever vicious soap opera, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. said yesterday that it would buy its most reviled rival and Mr. Turner's pet project, World Championship Wrestling, a unit of AOL Time Warner.
3/19/2001	MediaTalk; AOL Sees a Different Side of Time Warner	Executives at America Online are learning what it means to be in business with Ted Turner, the company's vice chairman. Despite having a knack for making insensitive, off-the-cuff remarks about religion and ethnicity, Mr. Turner had largely stayed out of trouble since AOL and Time Warner announced they would merge.
3/9/2001	AOL STANDS BY FORECASTS	AOL Time Warner's co-chief operating officer, Robert W. Pittman, said yesterday that the company stood by its 2001 financial goals. ''Nothing's changed, and we're excited about our business,'' Mr. Pittman said. ''The company is in good position no matter what happens in the business cycle.'' AOL has been under scrutiny since Wednesday when Yahoo, a competitor and Internet bellwether, said it would fall short of revenue expectations. Noting that there are 28 million AOL members worldwide, Mr. Pittman said the company was better insulated from a slowdown in advertising than other companies. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
3/8/2001	AOL to Name Executive of Cinema Division to Run Its TV Unit	Seeking to bolster the prospects of its fledgling interactive television service, AOL Time Warner is expected to announce today the appointment of Robert Friedman, a top executive at the company's New Line Cinema film division, to the newly created position of president of AOL TV. AOL TV had been overseen by Barry Schuler, as the president of AOL Interactive. Now Mr. Friedman, 44, will be responsible for the service's daily operations and strategic direction. He will report directly to Mr. Schuler, whose duties have greatly increased since AOL merged with Time Warner in January and he became chairman and chief executive of the AOL unit of AOL Time Warner.
3/7/2001	AOL Combines TV Networks Under a Chief	AOL Time Warner announced yesterday that it was reorganizing its television holdings, putting the WB broadcast network and Ted Turner's old empire of basic cable channels under a new division to be headed by Jamie Kellner, the founder and chief executive of WB. The new division potentially gives AOL Time Warner the sort of cradle-to-grave reach of one of its rivals, Viacom Inc., which is able to draw younger viewers to Nickelodeon, teenagers to the MTV networks and older viewers to CBS, analysts said.
3/6/2001	VIVENDI TO ALTER AOL STAKE	Vivendi Universal has reached a preliminary agreement to sell its 55 percent stake in AOL France for $700 million worth of equity in AOL Europe, which could be converted to cash at a later date, a person close to the French media company said. An announcement could still be two weeks off, as the agreement must also be approved by shareholders in Cegetel, a French telephone company that is controlled by Vivendi Universal and that owns part of the stake along with another Vivendi unit, Canal Plus, according to the source, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. A Vivendi spokesman declined to comment. Andrei Bogolubov, a spokesman for AOL Europe, said ''There is no agreement to announce at this time.'' Suzanne Kapner
3/3/2001	U.S. COURT RULING LETS CABLE GIANTS WIDEN THEIR REACH	A federal appeals court struck down a set of regulations today that had prevented the nation's largest cable companies from growing larger and broadcasting more of their own shows. The panel found that the rules had violated the companies' First Amendment rights to reach new audiences and to control their programming. The decision is a tremendous victory for AT&T and AOL Time Warner, the nation's two largest cable operators, which have spent years trying to get regulators, lawmakers and judges to overturn the rules, known as cable concentration caps.
3/1/2001	AT&T Action on Venture	The AT&T Corporation asked AOL Time Warner yesterday to revise the structure of their joint venture in Time Warner Entertainment as a preliminary step to creating a corporation. That would enable AT&T to spin off its 25.5 percent stake to the public. But at the same time that AT&T made the request, it also said that it was suspending any registration action until March 15, raising some likelihood that the two sides could agree to a deal in which AOL Time Warner buys out the AT&T stake.
2/12/2001	A Makeover For CNNfn	AOL Time Warner recently said it would change the name of it's struggling financial cable news network, CNNfn, to CNN Money and see to it that the network became available on more cable systems. It could use the help.
2/1/2001	AOL Time Warner to Revamp CNNfn	CNNfn, the struggling financial cable network, will be given a new name, a slightly new focus, wider distribution and more cooperation from its corporate siblings, AOL Time Warner executives said yesterday. The network, which has been left in the dust by its main competitor, CNBC, will soon be called CNN Money. The new name and the other changes symbolize how AOL Time Warner intends to extract more synergies from its media properties than even Time Warner did, the executives said.
2/1/2001	AOL Time Warner Quarterly Loss Is Related to Merger	In its first report as a combined company, AOL Time Warner reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.09 billion yesterday because of costs related to the merger. The loss translated into 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of $201 million, or 5 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results were reported as if the merger were completed in 1999.
1/29/2001	European Union Investigates Signs of CD Price Fixing	The European Union has opened an antitrust investigation into the prices of compact discs in Europe, which it suspects are being kept artificially high by the five big music companies and European retailers. Earlier this week the European Commission, the union's executive body, sent letters to Universal Music and Video Distribution, the Sony Corporation of America, AOL Time Warner, EMI Music Distribution and Bertelsmann Music Group, and to 13 music store chains and 5 Web sites doing business in Europe. Two of the companies, EMI and Bertelsmann, are completing plans to merge.
1/28/2001	AOL Time Warner Base Lifts Silicon Alley	AOL Time Warner's decision to locate its corporate headquarters in New York seemed to have had little more impact than a few new signs going up in Rockefeller Center. After all, the heart of America Online is still based in Dulles, Va., many executives remain in other parts of the country and few new jobs came to the city. But nearly three weeks after Time Warner and America Online completed their merger, making it the world's largest Internet media company, the presence of its headquarters in Time Warner's skyscraper at 75 Rockefeller Plaza has already begun to have at least a psychological impact on Silicon Alley.
1/25/2001	New York Area Has a Cushion, Economists Say	Last week, Jupiter Media Metrix joined the list of Internet companies in Manhattan's Silicon Alley planning to cut jobs. On Tuesday, AOL Time Warner said it would eliminate some positions at its magazine division. That same day, J. C. Penney announced that it would close a store in Westchester County. But those were just the preliminary rounds to the main event that hit the New York area yesterday: Lucent Technologies said it would lay off about 1,500 people in New Jersey, or 9 percent of its work force in the state. And Henry B. Schacht, who recently returned as chief executive of Lucent, the company he ran in the heady days after its spinoff from AT&T in 1996, said it would probably take at least a year for Lucent to turn the corner.
1/24/2001	Metro Business Briefing; NEW HUGO BOSS STORE	The first big retail tenant for the AOL Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle, which is now a three-acre hole in the ground, was announced yesterday by the center's developers. The clothier Hugo Boss will lease a three-level, 14,300-square-foot store at the base of the building, which is to open in 2003. Although Hugo Boss is building a new store not far away, at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, Kenneth A. Himmel, president and chief executive of the Palladium Company, one of the partners in the center, said the West Side was a distinct submarket. David Dunlap (NYT)
1/24/2001	Merger Over, The New AOL Will Lay Off 2,000 Workers	The newly combined AOL Time Warner began a series of steps yesterday meant to streamline the company's far-flung operations, including the elimination of at least 2,000 jobs. The job cuts -- representing slightly more than 2 percent of the company's 85,000 workers -- come less than two weeks after America Online, the No. 1 Internet provider, completed its acquisition of Time Warner, one of the giants of traditional media. The cuts come atop the 400 jobs the company said last week that it would eliminate at its cable news network, CNN.
1/19/2001	AOL TIME WARNER PLANS TO BUY BACK $5 BILLION IN STOCK	AOL Time Warner said yesterday that it might repurchase as much as $5 billion, or about 2.3 percent, of its shares in the next two years because it thought the stock was undervalued. AOL Time Warner will also file to sell as much as $10 billion of securities like debt or common stock, Ed Adler, a spokesman, said. Proceeds from any sales may be used for investments, capital expenditures, payment of debt or financing of acquisitions. The company, created in a merger last week, is working to rebuild trust on Wall Street. Its shares rose 98 cents yesterday, to $49.77.
1/17/2001	President of CNNfn Quits As a Revamping Begins	C. Shelby Coffey III, the president of CNN's financial news network, CNNfn, has resigned from his position to pursue the creation of a medical foundation, Mr. Coffey said yesterday. His resignation represents the second announced departure of an important CNN executive since CNN's parent company, Time Warner, officially merged with America Online last week. On Friday, CNN announced that Bob Furnad, the president of CNN's Headline News, would leave to pursue a career teaching journalism and consulting with local television stations' news divisions.
1/13/2001	AOL Time Warner Sticks to Its Aggressive Goals	Just over a year after signing the biggest merger ever to create a new breed of technology-driven media company, the leaders of what late Thursday formally became AOL Time Warner said yesterday that they were sticking to the aggressive financial goals promised to investors. The merger of Time Warner, the nation's biggest media company, and America Online, the largest Internet service, was completed just hours after it received final approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The deal, which was originally announced on Jan. 10, 2000, took months longer to complete than the companies expected because of tough regulatory reviews in Washington and Europe.
1/12/2001	F.C.C. Approves AOL-Time Warner Deal, With Conditions	Clearing the final obstacle to the creation of the world's biggest media business, the Federal Communications Commission approved tonight the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner. In doing so, however, the agency laid down conditions intended to make America Online's popular instant-messaging service compatible with the systems of Internet rivals. Officials said the conditions were imposed because the merger joined the world's largest Internet company, AOL, with the nation's second-largest cable company, Time Warner. Regulators said they feared that the company could take advantage of its dominance over instant messaging to monopolize related Internet services that might be developed for high-speed cable connections. Executives of the companies closed the deal shortly after the agency's announcement. The commission's order, issued a year and a day after the announcement of the merger, is the final major decision by the commission under the leadership of William E. Kennard, who said that he intended to step down before President-elect George W. Bush took office on Jan. 20. All five commissioners supported approval of the merger, although only the three Democrats voted to impose conditions on the instant messaging service as the price of completing the deal. ''The conditions we impose today are forward-looking and fair,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''They preserve the openness of the Internet. They protect consumers and avoid heavy-handed regulation by using a narrowly tailored market-opening approach. And they ensure that neither AOL Time Warner nor a government agency will pick winners and losers in this dynamic marketplace.'' Last month the Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the companies agreed to stringent conditions meant to ensure competition in providing Internet services and the interactive television systems of the future. Executives of the companies had pledged to open their instant messaging services within a year. But F.C.C. officials said that the voluntary commitment of AOL, while laudable, was not enough, and that the order would actually require the company to open its messaging services. The companies made it clear that they could live with those demands. ''The conditions on open access are consistent with our memorandum of understanding that we signed last year, and our business model,'' said Kathy McKiernan, an AOL spokeswoman. ''We believe the instant messaging conditions were unnecessary, but we're pleased that they do not affect our current services, and they will have no financial impact on the company.'' Moreover, the lasting effects of the F.C.C.'s order on future policy makers may be fleeting. In a sign of the sharp shift in direction the agency may take under the Bush administration, one of the two commissioners who sharply dissented on the conditions imposed on the merger was Michael K. Powell, the leading inside contender to be the next head of the agency. ''I believe the majority has given in too much to their collective imaginations, rather than sound reasoning based on the record, in reaching some of the conditions on the merger,'' Mr. Powell wrote. ''This order makes clear that the F.C.C. has jurisdiction to regulate virtually every Internet product.'' Mr. Powell's father, Gen. Colin L. Powell, has been nominated as secretary of state. General Powell also serves on the board of America Online. Michael Powell decided not to remove himself from the review after ethics officials at the F.C.C. said his relationship to his father did not pose a regulatory problem. Consumer groups hailed tonight's decision. Combined with conditions imposed on the deal last month by the Federal Trade Commission, they said, the terms have made the deal more attractive to consumers. ''In the face of enormous dangers to consumers, federal regulators have imposed critical consumer protections on the merger of AOL and Time Warner,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. ''The combined actions of the F.C.C. and the F.T.C. have transformed a merger that threatened competition into one that could actually expand consumers' choices for high-speed Internet and interactive TV services.'' Calling the order a ''tremendous win for consumers,'' Edward Adler, a Time Warner spokesman, said, ''AOL Time Warner will be uniquely positioned to speed the development of the interactive medium and the growth of all its businesses for the benefit of consumers worldwide.'' The order today was a compromise among the Democrats, and was hammered out after weeks of intense negotiations. Compounding the complexity of the review was the fact that the agency has never confronted many of the regulatory questions posed by the merger of the two companies. At bottom, the questions raised -- about instant messaging, telephone service on the Internet and interactive television -- involve issues that do not fit neatly into a regulatory scheme created long before the Internet. AOL's instant messaging services are a kind of hybrid that combines the most attractive features of telephones and e-mail by allowing two or more computer users to communicate virtually instantaneously. The company's two instant messaging services, AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ, have more than 140 million registered users, dwarfing competing services offered by Microsoft, Yahoo and others. Under the order, AOL must make the system compatible with the instant messaging system of at least one rival immediately once AOL Time Warner augments its own service to allow the exchange of live video. Within six months it would have to make its messaging system compatible with those of at least two other rivals. Mr. Kennard said the commission had approached the proposed merger from a historical framework, hoping to avoid a repeat of AT&T's growth earlier this century into a monopoly that effectively shut out any competitors by making its telephone system incompatible with those of rivals. ''The fundamental issue is not different from the interconnection issues of the last century,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''The emerging monopoly of AT&T occurred because it did not allow other companies to interconnect. What has made this review challenging is that the Internet has grown and flourished by not being dominated by a single entity. But now the fear has emerged that one entity may be able to dominate this marvelous new means of communicating'' through instant messaging. At the same time, there was concern about being too heavy-handed in regulating the Internet, particularly because technological changes have come so rapidly in the largely unregulated industry. The commissioners thus rejected proposals to set the standards for compatible instant messaging services or precise deadlines. Instead, the agency decided to use AOL's commitment to make its system compatible with those of rivals within the next year, and impose penalties on the company if it fails to live up to that schedule. ''All of the commissioners wanted to do something, but do it in an Internet-friendly way,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''The days of government micromanaging protocols and standards are passed. We can't expect government lawyers to write technical standards. But we also tried to look at this from a consumer's point of view and ask: 'Does the consumer have a choice? Is there a danger that a single player becomes so dominant that other players can't thrive?' '' Mr. Kennard, who has led the agency since 1997 and served before that as its general counsel, gave his farewell address to the commission this morning. He choked with emotion as he praised the staff and his fellow commissioners.
1/9/2001	Time and AOL Plan Internet Life Magazine	In an example of the potential advantages, and drawbacks, of the expected merger of Time Warner and America Online, Time Inc. will begin to publish On, a magazine about life on the Internet. The new magazine will have AOL's help in marketing, but its editors agree that they must work to persuade readers that the publication is not just an AOL house organ.
12/21/2000	AOL Issues Plea for Fast F.C.C. Approval	America Online and Time Warner want to close their merger this year and would incur ''substantial burden and expense'' if they are unable to do so, America Online told the Federal Communications Commission today. If the deal has not gained regulatory approval by Dec. 31, AOL said in its filing with the commission, the two companies will have to file more than 10,000 part-year state and local tax returns. They would also file more documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission and conduct ''costly and duplicative'' auditing reviews, AOL argued.
12/19/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Time Warner Scales Back Its Forecast	Time Warner scaled back its financial forecast yesterday, sending its shares and those of its merger partner, America Online, plummeting by more than 13 percent. The announcement, coming only a few days after Time Warner won approval from the Federal Trade Commission for its merger with AOL, stirred investors' concern about the growth prospects for the combined company.
12/18/2000	Rules for AOL Time Warner May Have Only a Narrow Impact	Amid all the talk last week about how the government's restrictions on the merger of America Online and Time Warner would usher in new competition for high-speed Internet access, one salient fact seemed to be lost: only 12 percent of the nation's homes subscribe to Time Warner's cable service. So anything that the AOL-Time Warner deal ushers in regarding high-speed Internet service will be directly relevant to fewer than an eighth of the nation's consumers. Anyone, therefore, who thinks that the AOL-Time Warner deal has set a pattern for the nation's broadband Internet industry may end up being rudely surprised.
12/16/2000	An Unlikely Policeman for Mergers	After years of costly lobbying, legal wrangling and political maneuvering, it turns out that a small group of antitrust officials here in Washington will be the new Internet regulators. They will police a marketplace and force competition in markets that thousands of local governments, lawmakers in Congress, the White House, the courts and the Federal Communications Commission had refused to touch. When the Federal Trade Commission announced its decision on Thursday to approve the merger of America Online and Time Warner, it imposed a new regulatory regime on a major cable player that forces it to open its networks to rival Internet companies. The new rules came not from any overriding industry policy initiative, but as the upshot of an F.T.C. review of a corporate acquisition.
12/15/2000	Consumers Can Expect More Internet Providers	Before the Federal Trade Commission intervened, perhaps the only tangible outcome for consumers from America Online's planned acquisition of Time Warner was a lot of promotion of Time Warner products on AOL platforms, and vice versa. If the deal clears the remaining regulatory hurdles in coming weeks, customers of the combined company are sure to see more of the same. Subscribers to AOL's high-speed Internet service can now see the latest edition of CNN Headline News, a Time Warner property, on their computers and Warner Music's compact discs will soon include AOL's software, for example. The companies have said that America Online subscribers are signing up for subscriptions to Time Inc.'s magazines at record rates, a result of pop-up advertising on the opening screen.
12/15/2000	Two Become One, and Then What?	With the tough restrictions imposed by the Federal Trade Commission, falling stock prices and the clouded economic outlook, America Online and Time Warner face some significant speed bumps as they try to achieve their grand visions of being the media company for the new century. But while these impediments may slow the companies, they do not fundamentally alter the ability of the unified AOL Time Warner to take advantage of its combined power in broadcasting, publishing, film, music and the Internet, analysts and executives said yesterday.
12/15/2000	Some Tangled Issues Kept F.T.C. on Edge During Negotiations	As he sat in his office earlier this fall, Mozelle W. Thompson, the member of the Federal Trade Commission most skeptical about the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner, described to the companies' top executives how his TV screen went blue when Time Warner abruptly pulled ABC from its cable systems. The anecdote prompted Steve Case, the chief executive of AOL, to turn to Gerald Levin, his counterpart at Time Warner, slap his knee playfully and remark sarcastically, ''Way to go, Gerry.''
12/15/2000	Media Rivals See Victory In Restrictions From F.T.C.	Consumer groups and rival media companies declared victory in their campaign to persuade the Federal Trade Commission to impose tough restrictions on the Ameria Online-Time Warner merger. Those who had expressed the loudest fears about the potential power of the new company said the commission's ruling had significantly -- though not entirely -- addressed their concerns that the new company would dominate the Internet and interactive television markets and stifle competition.

11/13/2000	Is the Web a Vehicle to New Riches for Warner Bros.?	After America Online and Time Warner announced their merger in January, AOL representatives approached a number of marketing executives at the Hollywood studios. The company was offering each studio premium positions throughout AOL's online service and Web site to promote new films, according to a studio executive involved in the discussions. The total price was $20 million in cash and guaranteed media exposure for the AOL logo in the studios' own promotions of their films. The studio executive asked AOL: ''What happens when a Warner Brothers movie is opening at the same time as one of my films? Who will get preferential treatment?''
11/13/2000	Partners May Have Underestimated Antitrust Issues	When executives of America Online and Time Warner announced plans for the largest merger in history nearly a year ago, most analysts and legal experts predicted there would be few significant regulatory obstacles standing in the way of the deal. But one widely overlooked sign that the deal faced heavy scrutiny was the tough behind-the-scenes battle waged by the nation's two top antitrust regulators, Joel Klein at the Justice Department and Robert Pitofsky at the Federal Trade Commission, over which agency would review the merger.
11/13/2000	Ready or Not, the Future Is Big and Bundled	The union of disparate media properties that will take place when America Online and Time Warner combine forces is likely to loom large in the advertising landscape -- perhaps too large, some agency executives worry, because of the concentration in fewer hands of the power to set rates for commercial time and advertising space. Others, however, welcome what they describe as the myriad opportunities that the merger will open to help marketers sell goods and services more effectively. They point primarily to the bundling of properties in various combinations to reach specific consumer groups, though the creation of such packages can be problematic if marketers perceive themselves as being forced to buy something they don't want to gain access to something they do.
11/13/2000	Bulked-up AOL May Not Get Bigger on Time Warner Fare	The pending combination of America Online and Time Warner represents by far the most powerful player on the Internet, both in providing online access and in online advertising. But AOL was already dominant before the merger. So while various product combinations and marketing deals can help AOL expand its online audience a bit, competitors say, the effect may be modest at best.
11/13/2000	A Start, but Only a Start, Toward an Inevitable Transition	There is little doubt that one of the main reasons America Online Inc. wants to acquire Time Warner Inc. is potential access to Time Warner's extensive cable television network, the second biggest in the nation. America Online is the leviathan of the dial-up Internet, with almost 25 million subscribers worldwide, but has almost no presence in the business of providing links to cyberspace over high-speed, or broadband, connections, which can be as much as 30 times faster than standard analog modems. The pressure on America Online arises from the fact that, one way or another, the majority of its United States subscribers will probably migrate to broadband over the next five years or so. If America Online does not migrate with them, the company could be left behind.
11/13/2000	Tapping the Internet's Power As an 'Obsession Incubator'	It is difficult to find a consensus on what the pending merger of Time Warner and America Online means for the music industry. Some music industry analysts contend that the combination would give Warner Music, which is now third in market share in the United States, an enviable edge in competing against rivals like Seagram's Universal/ MCA and Sony for a bigger share of the nation's highly competitive music business.
11/13/2000	Dissecting the Deal; If AOL and Time Warner Do Merge, Regulators, Competitors and Analysts Wonder How the Pieces Will Add Up	THE two companies promise to create a 21st-century bridge between the new Internet economy and the venerable entertainment and publishing industries. Government antitrust officials, meanwhile, are trying to prevent the companies from building too powerful an information-age monolith.
11/13/2000	Rivals Question Sincerity of a Promise to Play Fair as the Interactive Arena Grows	Among television industry executives and analysts, there is wide agreement that the new company could have enormous influence over what millions of people watch on television. But they say much remains unclear right now. And they are not sure to what degree the company might be able to wield that influence as a competitive weapon or as leverage in negotiations over which cable channels get carried; how much promotion those channels receive on the Internet, and how prominently they are placed on the AOLTV interactive TV service. It is unclear what sort of restrictions federal regulators would place on the company's influence.
11/13/2000	Magazine Rivals Fretting; In Books, a Wary Watch	The new version of Time Inc. that will emerge from the chrysalis phase of the Time Warner-America Online merger is igniting a wide range of reactions from the chief executives of America's magazine companies and the analysts who watch them. In the book industry, no one seems to care -- at least not yet.
11/10/2000	F.T.C. Agrees To Extension On AOL Deal	With federal officials threatening to block the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner over antitrust concerns, the two companies received three more weeks today to iron out their differences with regulators. After meeting in closed session this afternoon to review the proposed merger, the five commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission emerged to issue a cryptic statement saying that the agency would give the companies only three more weeks to satisfy its concerns.
11/9/2000	F.T.C. to Consider AOL Deal Today	The Federal Trade Commission is scheduled to meet on Thursday to consider the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner. People following the review said today that it was uncertain what action would be taken by the five commissioners, who will meet in a closed session. The commissioners have three options: approving or rejecting a consent decree negotiated between the staff of the agency and lawyers for the companies or sending the matter back to the staff for further negotiations.
1/2/2014	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Time Warner holders look beyond a drop in share price to happy days after the AOL merger.	BACK in January, in the good old days when Internet stocks were hot, America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL stock. The deal, if approved by regulators, would leave AOL shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company, even though Time Warner's revenue and cash flow are far greater. AOL stock has since fallen almost a third, destroying most of the premium the company had offered for control of Time Warner. So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America Online's chairman, Stephen M. Case, had bamboozled his Time Warner counterpart, Gerald R. Levin, into taking AOL shares at the worst possible time.
10/12/2000	AOL-Time Warner Merger Is Cleared by Europeans	The European Commission officially gave a green light today to Time Warner's $165 billion merger with America Online, but the companies face bigger objections from antitrust regulators in Washington. After four months of scrutiny, the European Commission took a fairly relaxed position and focused its demands almost entirely on preventing the merged company from dominating online music distribution.
10/11/2000	Why U.S. Giants Are Crying Uncle; Europe's Top Antitrust Regulator Steps Up Merger Scrutiny	If American companies have any lingering doubts about Mario Monti's toughness, they are likely to be dispelled on Wednesday. Mr. Monti, the European Union's chief antitrust regulator, is expected to approve the proposed $165 billion merger between Time Warner Inc. and America Online Inc. -- but not without extracting a heavy price.
10/8/2000	Turning Miles Into Money	FOR many of the tens of millions of Americans who participate in frequent-flier programs, it is feast or famine. Some road warriors have so many frequent-flier miles sitting in their accounts that they have no hope of using them up, or no desire to cash them in to spend even more time away from home, while other occasional fliers have too few miles to qualify for any travel award. A pair of Internet start-ups, MilePoint and AOL AAdvantage, are taking aim at both groups. MilePoint (www.milepoint.com) is scheduled to begin accepting memberships sometime this month and will allow frequent fliers to convert their miles into a form of online currency that can be used for discounts of 5 to 25 percent with a variety of retailers, including Amazon.com, The Sharper Image and Hammacher Schlemmer.
10/6/2000	Time Warner And EMI Halt Venture Plan	Faced with opposition from European antitrust regulators, Time Warner and the EMI Group of Britain withdrew their application today for a $20 billion joint venture to link their music businesses and said they would work to submit a revised plan. The decision came on the day of a meeting of regulators in Brussels, at which the chief European antitrust official, Mario Monti, was expected to propose clearance for Time Warner's separate and much larger combination with America Online.
10/4/2000	New Prospects Seen in Europe For EMI Deal	European regulators are considering approving the proposed $20 billion combination of the music division of Time Warner Inc. and the EMI Group into a joint venture, a development that would remove the last major barrier in Europe to the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online. Industry officials said today that Mario Monti, the European commissioner in charge of competition issues, would reconvene an advisory group on Thursday that had rejected the deal, at Mr. Monti's urging, just a week ago.
9/29/2000	Europe Reported Ready to Block Time Warner's Deal With EMI	European antitrust regulators plan to block Time Warner's joint venture with the British music conglomerate EMI Group but are much closer to approving Time Warner's $135 billion merger with America Online, people close to the talks said today. Mario Monti, the European antitrust commissioner, issued recommendations on both deals on Wednesday in a closed meeting with antitrust regulators from individual European countries, these people said.
9/29/2000	Foreign Affairs; Under the Volcano	So you get home tonight and you get on AOL and you have a question about your bill or a technical glitch. You go to the AOL help section and get online with an AOL helper, who walks you through your problem, using e-mail back and forth. Do you know whom you're talking to? You're talking to a Filipino techie working in AOL's back office, which, thanks to a fiber-optic cable under the Pacific, is now located here at the former Clark Air Base outside Manila, beneath the Mount Pinatubo volcano. The AOL member services center in the Philippines employs 900 young Filipino techies, who, working on computers in three eight-hour shifts, now handle about 90 percent of the 600,000 online billing and technical questions that pour into AOL each month. ''I got this member online one day,'' said Christine Dizon, one of many Filipino AOL techies I interviewed here, ''and she asked me: 'Where are you?' And I said, 'I'm in the Philippines.' And she said, 'You're kidding me, right?' I told her, 'No, I'm really in the Philippines.' Sometimes people ask if we're machines. We tell them no, we're alive and kicking.''
9/28/2000	SENATORS RAISE AOL CONCERNS	A Senate committee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection convened yesterday to discuss interactive television. But with Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, present, questions turned to issues standing in the way of the proposed AOL-Time Warner merger. Members of the committee tried to tackle thorny topics like whether Time Warner should be required to open its cable network to all Internet service providers as a condition of the merger and whether AOL would share its popular instant messaging services. Mr. Case sought to assuage concerns, noting that many Internet service providers are waiting until after the merger to negotiate for access to Time Warner's cable systems and saying the messaging technology could be compatible with other systems.
9/28/2000	EUROPEANS DELIBERATE ON DEALS	European antitrust regulators met in Brussels yesterday to decide whether concessions submitted by Time Warner and its proposed partners, America Online and the EMI Music Group, were sufficient to allay European concerns that the planned deals would choke competition in the Internet distribution of music. The regulators, from the national antitrust agencies of the 15 European Union member states, were expected to issue a recommendation whether to accept or reject the concessions, or possibly to seek further clarification from the companies. John Tagliabue
9/28/2000	DOCOMO-AOL PARTNERSHIP	Japan's leading cellular phone company, NTT DoCoMo, and America Online announced a widely expected strategic partnership yesterday that they said would propel the two companies into the forefront of global wireless Internet services. DoCoMo will take a 42.3 percent stake in AOL Japan and will feature AOL mail and Instant Messenger on DoCoMo's i-mode service, the largest wireless Internet service in the world, with more than 12 million subscribers. The partnership will catapult AOL Japan, a laggard among Japanese fixed-line Internet access providers, into a leading position in the Japanese market and give AOL's content to wireless users with a DoCoMo phone. Kiyoyuki Tsujimura, managing director of global business development at DoCoMo, said the partners would collaborate on new ways to integrate wireless and fixed-line Internet services, so that, for example, a bidder in an online auction could participate via mobile phone. Miki Tanikawa
9/26/2000	NTT DoCoMo Confirms Talks With AOL	NTT DoCoMo Inc., the largest mobile communications company in Japan, confirmed today that it was in advanced talks about an alliance with America Online. A deal could greatly expand the AOL presence in Japan, where it has made little headway since introducing its services here three years ago. NTT DoCoMo has attracted 12 million subscribers in Japan to its service, known as i-mode, which allows users to gain access to the Internet from their mobile phones. AOL, by contrast, has attracted 400,000 to 500,000 users.
9/19/2000	2 Time Warner Mergers Facing Peril in Europe	Antitrust regulators at the European Commission are threatening to block the $165 billion merger of Time Warner and America Online, as both sides prepare to negotiate a possible settlement over the next week. European officials in Brussels have drawn up proposed rejection language, according to a person close to the discussions, arguing that the merger could choke off competition in the distribution of music and entertainment over the Internet.
9/13/2000	AOL TAKES STAKE IN CYBIKO	America Online has invested in Cybiko, Inc., a Bloomingdale, Ill.-based maker of Palmlike hand-held devices aimed at teenage consumers. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Don Wisniewski, president of Cybiko, said that as a result AOL had become a ''significant shareholder'' in the company. The two companies have also agreed to work together to give users of the Cybiko devices access to AOL features like Instant Messaging. Catherine Greenman
9/11/2000	AOL-Time Warner Rivals Preparing for Interactive TV Fight	After a decade of false starts, interactive television may be heading into tens of millions of living rooms in the United States over the next two years. But even before most people have the chance to click their remotes to check a sports score or order a pizza, an industry battle is brewing over who will lay claim to the tens of billions of dollars in new revenue that interactive advertising is expected to yield. So far, the contest has mainly involved quiet jockeying for position by television networks, cable and satellite television companies, and various technology vendors -- all of which want to make sure that they get at least their fair share of the presumed bounty. But last week the conflict exploded into one of the central disputes in the government's review of America Online's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.
9/7/2000	No Concessions to Clear Its Merger, America Online Says	Despite unusually sharp criticism from European antitrust regulators, executives of Time Warner and America Online do not plan to offer any concessions to clear their proposed merger plans when they meet regulators behind closed doors here on Thursday, company executives said today. Instead, the companies will try to refute European arguments that the merged company would harm competition because of its enormous size.
9/6/2000	Limits May Soon Emerge For AOL Deal	Government regulators are finishing work on a list of conditions they would like to impose on America Online and Time Warner for the $165 billion merger of the companies to be approved, people involved in the talks between the government and the companies say. Most important, they say, the government wants to force the combined company, to be known as AOL Time Warner, to open its cable television systems to other companies that want to offer high-speed Internet services.
8/29/2000	BLUEFLY EXPANDS AOL AGREEMENT	Bluefly.com, an Internet retailer that sells designer clothes at discount prices, said it expanded an agreement with America Online, and the company's shares surged 77 percent. Bluefly.com's merchandise will be listed in several categories on seven of America Online's shopping sites, the company said in a press release. More than 20,000 of Bluefly.com's products will be available through America Online's shopping search function. Bluefly.com has relied on links with America Online and other Internet sites to help funnel customers to its Internet store. Shares of Bluefly.com, which is based in New York, jumped $1.50, to $3.44. The shares are still down about 67 percent this year.
8/24/2000	INKTOMI, AOL AND ADERO FORM ALLIANCE	Three Internet companies have formed a technology and network service alliance aimed at making the Internet an easier place to navigate. The three, Inktomi, America Online and the closely held Adero, formed a venture, called Content Bridge. Inktomi will provide the network infrastructure technology; Adero will ensure that content is updated and will provide a centralized billing system, and AOL will deploy Content Bridge on its network. Content Bridge will also let Web-operating companies like Digital Island and Exodus Communications improve online delivery of audio, video and software files.
8/10/2000	WAL-MART BUYS SHOPSMART STAKE	The Asda Group, a British supermarket chain owned by Wal-Mart Stores, and America Online's British unit, AOL UK, said yesterday that they had acquired a 22.5 percent stake in ShopSmart.com, an online shopping directory in Britain. AOL UK will market Shopsmart.com online, and Asda will promote the Web site in its stores. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Andrew Ross Sorkin
8/9/2000	Choice of Jewish Candidate Is Noted in Slurs on Internet	The selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut for the Democratic ticket has prompted a barrage of anti-Semitic comments in online chat rooms and on Internet message boards, leading at least a few online services to start deleting offensive postings. In the first hours after the news broke on Monday, chat rooms on America Online and Yahoo were peppered with slurs against Jews. At times, as many as half the comments included offensive remarks.
7/31/2000	New Economy; AOL's rivals want to see its instant messaging system open up before a merger makes the company any bigger.	TO hear some rivals of America Online talk about it, the case for opening up its instant messaging service -- or I.M., as it is known in the trenches -- is a struggle between the forces of democracy and those of autocratic rule. ''Mr. Case, on behalf of the I.M. industry and users everywhere, tear down this wall!'' Ross Bagully, chief executive of an America Online rival, Tribal Voice, said in testimony before the Federal Communications Commission last Thursday, after a speech by AOL's chairman, Steve Case. ''Users of I.M., like users of e-mail and the telephone,'' Mr. Bagully said, ''deserve the right to free and open communication.''
7/28/2000	AOL and Time Warner Face Criticism at F.C.C. Hearing	Stephen M. Case and Gerald M. Levin came to Washington today to defend the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner against a rising tide of criticism that the new colossus will be so anticompetitive that it must be reined in by regulators even before its creation. As they have in the past, Mr. Case, chairman and chief executive of AOL, and Mr. Levin, his counterpart at Time Warner, vowed to keep their cable, broadcast and Internet systems open to rivals, and said it would be against their business interests to discriminate against other companies that rely on them.
7/24/2000	Making Money Vs. Doing Good?	Silicon Valley entrepreneurs fall into two categories, John Doerr, the Valley's most prominent venture capitalist, told a group of Internet executives last week. There are the missionaries, he said, and there are the mercenaries. ''Missionaries obsess on the customer,'' explained Mr. Doerr, a partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. By way of an example, he offered Jeff Bezos, the somewhat embattled chief executive of Amazon.com, a Kleiner investment.
7/21/2000	America Online Registers Strong Profit for Quarter	Signaling that the problems of many Internet start-ups are not hurting their larger cousins, America Online yesterday reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $338 million, up 115 percent from a year earlier. America Online, the world's biggest Internet company and one of the few profitable ones, earned 13 cents a share, 2 cents more than analysts had expected. But analysts, generally conservative in their predictions, said the results were solid but contained few surprises.
7/19/2000	CITIGROUP PLANS AOL PARTNERSHIP	Citigroup and America Online are teaming up to offer payment and other financial services on the Internet. The companies announced a series of pacts letting AOL's 26 million subscribers use Citigroup technology to make online money transfers, while granting Citigroup access to advertising space on AOL Web pages. Under a two-and-a-half-year contract, for example, Citigroup will be able to post ads on personal account pages. A five-year agreement gives AOL the use of Citigroup's payment processing services. Financial terms were not disclosed.
6/28/2000	AOL to Distribute Software To Secure Music Copyrights	In a deal that may break a logjam in promoting the secure downloading of music from the Internet, America Online said yesterday that it had agreed to include software from the InterTrust Technologies Corporation on compact discs containing AOL 6.0, the newest version of its own popular software, later this year. InterTrust allows a recording company to wrap music in software that ensures it will only be played according to rules specified by the company. Before downloading a song, customers would agree to terms like how much they would pay, or how long they would be able to play it. But to make that choice, they would need to have special software to interpret what is being offered.
6/19/2000	Combining the Tube and the Chat Room	One of the features most responsible for America Online's success has been the buddy list -- the small box on the computer screen showing a user which friends are logged on and available for an instant online conversation. Now the company is testing the power of buddyship even more. Today it will introduce AOLTV, the centerpiece of the company's AOL Anywhere strategy to move beyond the personal computer.
6/19/2000	One Aspect Of Messages On the Internet To Be Delayed	Despite the explosive popularity of instant-messaging programs on the Internet, it became apparent last week that one facet of the service may not be instant at all: it may be a year or more before users of competing instant-message services can send missives to one another. Despite more than a year of wrangling between America Online, the industry leader by far, and its competitors, the fate of this service, which permits users to send messages over the Internet that quickly pop up on a recipient's screen, remains mired in technical and political snags.
6/19/2000	After Attack by Hackers, AOL Tightens Data Access	America Online said yesterday that it would take steps to fix flaws in its network that allowed hackers to get access to personal information about some members last week. Richard D'Amato, a spokesman for America Online, said the company did not yet have a specific number of how many member accounts were affected and what damage was done, but added that the company believes the number was about 200. The service has about 23 million subscribers.
6/5/2000	Merger Plan Facing Review	America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. faces an extended review by European Union regulators, though the transaction is unlikely to be blocked, analysts and lawyers said. The European Commission is scheduled to decide by Wednesday whether to approve the transaction, which would form the world's largest media and Internet company, or to examine it for four more months. The agency has until June 14 to make a similar decision in a related case, the proposed merger of Time Warner's recorded-music unit with that of the EMI Group.
5/30/2000	Gateway and AOL Bypass Industry Stalwarts on Components	Breaking ranks with the powerful ''Wintel duopoly,'' based on Intel hardware and Microsoft software, Gateway and America Online plan to announce on Tuesday that they will use a processor from an upstart Silicon Valley chip maker and a version of the Linux operating system in a new Internet home appliance scheduled to go on sale later this year. The decision is a big victory for the Transmeta Corporation, a chip design company in Santa Clara, Calif., that has developed a microprocessor intended to be a low-power and inexpensive alternative to Intel's microprocessors.
5/29/2000	StarMedia Faces New Challenges in Latin America	When rumors circulated last month that the American company StarMedia Network might be acquired by Terra Networks, the Internet industry found the story plausible. After all, StarMedia, based in New York, had one of last year's hot Internet stock offerings but had seen its shares fall precipitously. And its Web portal, which since 1996 had been the premier gateway to material on the Internet in Spanish and Portuguese, was facing increased competition in Latin America.
5/19/2000	Computer Whizzes At Philippine Pay; Technologically Literate People Service and Supply U.S. Business	Maybe it was a couple of 20-something Filipinos who created the rogue e-mail program that disabled computer systems on May 4. Maybe it wasn't. But there is no doubt that a couple of other young Filipinos played a big part in rubbing the bug out. The two -- Richard Cheng, 24, and Maricel Soriano, 23 -- were on duty at the Manila office of an antivirus software company, Trend Micro Inc., when the company was first notified of the problem shortly after lunch that day. As the scourge spread across time zones from Australia to Europe, Mr. Cheng was already writing an antidote, and by the end of the day, Ms. Soriano was disseminating instructions to afflicted Trend Micro customers around the world on how to apply it.
5/18/2000	AOL Offers Net Portals To Schools and Teachers	Any good marketer knows that one of the keys to a product's success is to extend the brand name into new areas. America Online has lots of good marketers (witness those 250-hours-free CD's, the stuff of junk-mail legend), so it comes as little surprise that AOL is now extending its brand name into schools. With AOL@School (www.school.aol.com), which began operating this week, America Online is offering schools an easy gateway to the Internet, similar to what Electric SchoolHouse, the Copernicus Education Gateway and others have done. AOL's service consists of six portals, four for students (grouped by grade, from kindergarten through high school), one for teachers and one for administrators. All are available no matter what Internet service provider is used, and will also be available from home.
5/18/2000	Time Warner Editor	To the Editor: Re '' 'Super-Editor' Spot May Be Created at Post-Merger AOL-Time Warner'' (Business Day, May 15): Steve Case, the chairman of America Online, and I never considered a ''super-editor'' position to supersede Time Inc.'s editor in chief. Like Time Inc., CNN has its own tradition of journalistic integrity that it actively safeguards.
5/16/2000	AUTONATION TO BE EXCLUSIVE CAR DEALER ON AOL	The car seller AutoNation Inc. said yesterday that it would become the exclusive auto retailer on the AutosDirect Web pages of America Online. AOL, based in Dulles, Va., said AutoNation had the country's largest inventory of new and used cars available for online sales. AutoNation, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., owns a chain of 400 car dealerships across the United States and operates a retail Web site. The company said it would maintain the separate Web site after the introduction of the AOL service this fall. Financial terms of the deal between AutoNation and AOL were not disclosed.
5/15/2000	Divided against each other; united against the government.	ABOUT a year ago, Joel Klein, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division and perhaps Bill Gates's least favorite lawyer, was moving into his new home in Washington. He called for cable service and was told that the cable guy could come between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday. Could they be more specific, Mr. Klein asked.
5/15/2000	'Super-Editor' Spot May Be Created At Post-Merger AOL-Time Warner	Last Thursday night, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., boogied to the sounds of Barenaked Ladies, the Canadian pop group, at a party at San Francisco's Pacific Bell Stadium. The occasion was an invitation-only party for a 1,000 guests to introduce Time Inc.'s E-Company Now, an offshoot of Fortune magazine that will focus on the Internet economy.
5/10/2000	What is a dot-com brand name worth? A new survey has some not-too-surprising answers.	MUCH has been made of the need for dot-coms to generate awareness of their names among computer users. Internet companies are spending billions of dollars online, in print and on television to establish their brands. Now comes a study that tries to identify the winners and losers in the big branding struggle. The study, which was conducted in October and released in mid-April by Greenfield Online, an Internet market research company based in Wilton, Conn., surveyed about 3,400 computer users. Among 100 Internet names placed before the respondents, Microsoft.com has the highest ''brand power,'' defined as a combination of rankings in three categories: brand familiarity, the brand's ability to affect the Internet landscape and the brand's perceived financial strength.
5/8/2000	Digital Future Is Up for Grabs In Cable Battle	Pick up the remote control in most households and the odds are that one of a half-dozen companies decided which channels are available. For years, squeezing a new network onto the limited available lineup meant cutting deals with Tele-Communications Inc. (now part of AT&T), Time Warner and a handful of other conglomerates. The giants' power was displayed in its raw form last week when Time Warner cut off Disney's ABC network from its systems for a day and a half. While that dispute was largely over the financial terms of a cable deal, Disney said it was also concerned that Time Warner, once merged with America Online, would take a similar gatekeeping role in an ever-expanding array of media.
5/7/2000	Disney Takes Its Case to City Hall	ALTHOUGH the Walt Disney Company received some relief from the Federal Communications Commission in its battle against Time Warner over ABC programming, Disney has taken its fight to another important arena: the cities and towns across America that control local cable franchises. Realizing that every city could become a pressure point, Disney executives have met with dozens of city officials to urge them to make changes in the franchise agreements with Time Warner when it merges with America Online.
5/5/2000	Time Warner's Power Play	Time Warner lost more than a skirmish over money with ABC this week when it backed down from kicking the network's programs off its cable service. Its blunt use of monopoly power was an instant public-relations disaster, and in the long run could enter the annals of business history as a famous strategic blunder. For by overriding the information and entertainment needs of millions of customers, Time Warner virtually compelled federal regulators to take a more searching look at Time Warner's proposed merger with AOL. After all, if Time Warner behaves this way now in response to Disney, the parent of ABC and a media giant itself, how will it behave after it joins forces with AOL? More to the point, will the merged company use its control of cable television's vital electronic pipeline to favor its own programs and deny competing programs fair access to millions of consumers along that pipeline?
5/3/2000	Public Relations Make a Poor Substitute for Soap Operas and Game Shows	Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations impresario, had planned the broad outlines of the Walt Disney Company's public relations strategy well before Time Warner Cable pulled the plug on the Disney-owned ABC network at 12:01 a.m. Monday. So when the channels carrying ABC programming faded to blue, except for the yellow letters that declared ''Disney has Taken ABC Away From You,'' Mr. Rubenstein and his clients were ready with their campaign to portray Time Warner as a rapacious monopolist.
5/2/2000	BLACKOUT OF ABC ON CABLE AFFECTS MILLIONS OF HOMES	Millions of television viewers found themselves without access to ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and many other popular television programs yesterday as a battle between the country's two biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt Disney, became a bitter public confrontation. The dispute involves how much Time Warner should pay Disney for carrying its cable channels. But it also touches on larger issues dealing with the distribution of news and entertainment programming, including the longstanding antipathy between the cable and broadcast industry, the growing competition between cable and satellite companies and Disney's opposition to the proposed merger between America Online and Time Warner.
5/1/2000	E-Commerce Report; Many analysts think the old-style expensive portal deals deserve more scrutiny from e-tailers.	FOR the last two years, Web portals, the jumping-off sites for many Internet surfers, have grabbed a piece of the e-commerce pie by offering retailers prime real estate on their sites. In exchange, the portals receive stratospheric tenancy fees. Sites like Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Excite, Lycos, AltaVista and Go flourished, as retailers fought for top billing within the portals' shopping categories. In the frenzy of dot-com investment last year, those deals cost merchants like Drugstore.com, Pets.com and Value America between $2 million and $5 million for every portal they signed with.
4/26/2000	DRKOOP.COM HIRES ADVISER TO LOOK INTO ALTERNATIVES	Drkoop.com, whose share price has dropped 74 percent in the last 12 months, has hired Bear Stearns & Company to explore strategic alternatives and said yesterday that America Online Inc. would take a stake in the company. The health care information site, co-founded by the former United States Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, said it would have a loss of 80 cents a share to 82 cents in the first quarter, well above the loss of 52 cents expected by analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. The company's auditors warned last month that they had ''substantial doubt'' about its ability to stay in business because of its negative cash flow. Yesterday it said it had about five months of cash remaining.
4/25/2000	AOL Moviefone to Introduce Voice-Recognition Technology	Taking its cue from an incident in a ''Seinfeld'' episode, AOL Moviefone will announce Tuesday that it is introducing voice-recognition capabilities to its telephone service in New York and New Jersey. The move will allow callers to buy movie tickets and get information on show times and theater locations by simply speaking into the phone rather than wending their way through a labyrinth of touch-tone menus.
4/25/2000	Big Companies Back New Intel Chip Rival	Transmeta, which aims to take on Intel in the processor market, announced today that it had received $88 million in financing from America Online and other heavyweights. Gateway, Compaq, Sony and several major Taiwan electronics manufacturers joined with AOL to invest $72 million.
4/19/2000	America Online Reports Its Best Earnings in Latest Quarter	America Online reported record revenue and earnings yesterday for its third fiscal quarter, crediting subscription growth, advertising sales and online commerce fees in handily beating analysts' estimates. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 11 cents a diluted share, beating the consensus estimate of 9 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, and meeting the so-called whisper number.
4/17/2000	2 Companies Take Separate Paths To Speed Delivery of Web Pages	Here's news: Some of the Internet's uncertainties have nothing to do with stock prices. Take the vagaries of surfing the Web, for example. Anyone who has ever watched a complex Web page paint itself onto the computer screen, image by grudgingly slow image, can attest that the World Wide Web should be faster. On that simple proposition there is virtually unanimous agreement.
4/13/2000	Unhappy AOL Campers	To the Editor: Many people like to design their own Web pages (''You Want to Be in Pictures? Will You Settle for a Web Page?'' March 16). But America Online 3.0 is eliminating Personal Publisher 2, which has been used by thousands of subscribers to create home pages.
4/3/2000	Compressed Data; How America Online Recruited a Top Recruiter	America Online has said little about how its corporate culture may change once it acquires Time Warner. But there is at least one clue that its eyes are now as much on traditional entertainment as on the Internet. America Online has created a position called chief talent scout, and it has hired a big-time headhunter, Michele James, to fill it. Ms. James was co-head of the media convergence practice at Korn/ Ferry International, the big recruiting firm, where she filled jobs in both new and old media.
3/26/2000	Travel Advisory; American and AOL To Link Reward Plans	America Online's AOL Rewards program has formed a partnership with American's frequent flier program, AAdvantage, and expects to start AOL AAdvantage by late May. Miles will be earned in the usual fashion through American Airlines and its airline, hotel and car-rental partners. But members will also be able to earn miles through an off-line network of airline, hotel, restaurant, rental car agencies and other merchants, by buying certain products and services through AOL, by enrolling in various services available on AOL, and by participating in surveys.
3/21/2000	AOL in E-Commerce Deal	America Online and PurchasePro.com announced a three-year alliance today to build an e-commerce marketplace. PurchasePro will power the interactive marketplace, which will allow AOL business users to buy and sell their products and services. The two companies will share advertising and transaction revenue from the service, expected by the end of the second quarter. America Online shares rose $2.50 today, to $66.875, but PurchasePro.com fell $22.50, to $129.25.
3/20/2000	Netscape Browser Faces a Changed World	Remember the browser war? Throughout the early years of the World Wide Web, there was a ferocious battle between Netscape Communications, developer of the first commercial Internet browser, and Microsoft as the companies introduced a rapid series of improved products.
3/20/2000	Free Music Software May Have Rattled AOL	Justin Frankel, a 21-year-old programming wizard who sold his digital music company, but perhaps not his soul, to America Online last year, did not endear himself to his new masters last week by publishing free software that enables users to find and trade music files quickly over the Internet. The software designed by Mr. Frankel and his team at AOL's Nullsoft unit is a variation of a popular program called Napster. College students and others have been using Napster in a frenzied exchange of music, pirated and not. The Recording Industry Association of America is suing Napster for copyright infringement.
3/18/2000	Bertelsmann to Sell Its Stake In Joint Ventures to AOL	America Online Inc. will purchase Bertelsmann's 50 percent stake in their joint ventures AOL Europe and AOL Australia for more than $8 billion, the companies said today. Such a move had been expected ever since AOL reached a deal to buy Time Warner Inc. in January for $165 billion. The deal would put the combined companies in direct competition with Bertelsmann, a leading global media conglomerate.
3/16/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Is the Online Auction King Ebay Going Once? Twice? Not Likely	So has eBay put itself up for the ultimate auction? Probably not, financiers close to eBay said yesterday, the morning after CNBC carried a report that the company was in talks that could lead to an acquisition of the auction site by Yahoo, the big Web portal.
3/15/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; 19 Charged With Insider Trading Using the Internet and a Clerk	In the first criminal case involving the swapping of inside stock information over the Internet, the federal authorities accused 19 people yesterday of making $8.4 million on illegal tips from a part-time graphics clerk on Wall Street who passed some of the information through private chat rooms and America Online's instant messaging system. The clerk, John J. Freeman, who had temporary jobs at Goldman, Sachs & Company and Credit Suisse First Boston, pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court in New York to sharing confidential information on corporate mergers in exchange for $70,000 to $110,000 in kickbacks from the trading profits.
3/15/2000	AMERICA ONLINE AND SEARS ENTER MARKETING AGREEMENT	America Online Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company agreed to market each other's products and develop a version of America Online's Internet service specifically for Sears customers. The program would provide direct communication with Sears customer service, special Sears offers and links to Sears Web sites. The 39 million holders of Sears credit cards will be able to pay America Online's monthly fee with their cards. Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Ill., will display America Online products and services at its 858 department stores. The company will also promote the service in its advertising. In exchange, America Online will promote Sears and its online shopping areas and products.
3/13/2000	Glimpse of the AOL-Time Warner Future	Susan Wyland, the managing editor of Real Simple, a new magazine from Time Inc. that will arrive on newsstands in two weeks, sat in her austere office last week and showed off proof pages of the first issue. She pointed to an artful, stylishly minimalist photograph illustrating the article ''The Fastest, Easiest Way to Clean Your Bathroom.'' ''I bet you have never, ever seen such a beautiful picture of a toilet bowl,'' Ms. Wyland said.
3/1/2000	AOL-Time Warner Pledge Questioned by Senate Panel	The proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner drew skeptical questioning today from the Senate Judiciary Committee, as lawmakers challenged a new pledge by the companies to open Time Warner's cable television system to other Internet service providers once the deal is completed. The pledge, announced just hours before the panel's hearing, was not binding, but it provided a framework for how the two companies would ensure that consumers have access over Time Warner Cable to service providers other than AOL.
2/28/2000	AOL Europe to Announce Bank Alliance	AOL Europe, a joint venture between America Online and Bertelsmann, will announce an alliance tomorrow with Deutsche Bank for AOL customers to bank over mobile phones, said the venture's chief executive, Andreas Schmidt. Placing America Online services on Internet-connected cellular telephones is a top priority for AOL Europe, said Mr. Schmidt, who spoke at the Harvard Business School's Cyberposium 2000 conference in Boston.
2/20/2000	The Assault Of the Salonistas	When the internet magazine Salon went public last June, nobody got obscenely rich. But the I.P.O. did underwrite a few perks that give the company the appearance of new-economy prosperity. Its swank new office in downtown San Francisco includes a communal kitchen with an impressive stainless-steel fridge and a balcony where the staff gathers for cocktails every Friday night. On a recent day, at noon, David Talbot, Salon's chairman and editor in chief, emerges from the weekly business meeting, his blue eyes showing signs of bleariness. Driving to work earlier this morning, he heard the news that AOL was merging with Time Warner. The deal sent tremors through the whole Internet establishment, but for Salon, it's the equivalent of a full-blown earthquake. The homespun, seat-of-your-pants era of the Internet -- the era in which Salon rose to prominence and which it, in some sense, grew to symbolize -- is history. Forging strange alliances, old and new media giants seem poised to carve up the Internet for themselves, leaving maybe a few table scraps for independent outfits like Salon.
2/18/2000	Minimal Research Prepared On AOL-Time Warner Deal	Wall Street analysts spend a lot of time talking about how companies in industries from retailing to telecommunications had better prepare for the changes the Internet will bring in the next few years. But they are having a hard time living up to their own talk when it comes to the pending merger of America Online and Time Warner Inc. The $120 billion deal, which is the biggest combination ever of a major Internet company with a traditional company, has gone largely uncovered by analysts at major securities firms like Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs. Almost six weeks after AOL and Time Warner announced their combination, the major firms have failed to produce a comprehensive look at the combined company's prospects.
2/17/2000	Financial Sites Are Said to Seek Merger	TheStreet.com, whose fledgling stock soared and then dipped sharply during the last six months, is in preliminary merger discussions with MarketWatch.com, a leading rival in the hotly contested business of delivering financial news online, a person close to the talks said yesterday. TheStreet said yesterday that it had hired the investment banking firm, Wasserstein Perella, to help the company find a buyer or a partner.
2/15/2000	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Executives hope the marriage of interactive television and consumers will be prosperous.	Survey by Myers Group finds that 94 percent of 500 advertising agency, media-buying and planning executives who respond say it is important to explore interactive television advertising; Myers chairman Jack Myers projects online advertising spending will grow 80 percent this year, to $4.32 billion; he expects America Online to capture 'the major share' of the growth (M)
2/13/2000	Again, It's Microsoft vs. the World	STEVEN BALLMER, the president of the Microsoft Corporation, returned again and again to a single question. ''What is the soul of MSN?'' he asked, referring to Microsoft's consumer Internet business by its three-letter logo. A pressing question indeed for the 70 Microsoft managers summoned last June to Building No. 27 here for a searching review of the business. They had come from ''Red West,'' a cluster of five buildings more than a mile from the main corporate campus and home to MSN Web sites like Expedia, Carpoint and MoneyCentral, and the MSN online service. Even within Microsoft, it was derided -- dubbed ''Red Vest,'' a place to hide from real work while waiting for one's lucrative stock options to vest. Outside Microsoft, it was regarded as a laboratory of failure, called ''Red Ink West,'' running up losses of as much as $1.5 billion since 1995, much of it squandered on a wayward effort to become a production studio for new media.
2/10/2000	AOL 5.0: Takeover Artist	SOME 21 million people now use America Online as their portal to the Internet, because it is easier to use than most alternatives. And for people who are just getting started in the online world, AOL does have many advantages. It streamlines the process of setting up an Internet account and offers a large collection of content and services, including highly popular services like instant messaging, buddy lists and chat rooms. But for anyone who connects to the Internet through another Internet service provider or through a business network, the newest version of AOL 5.0 can cause all sorts of problems.
2/3/2000	Clinton Enlists Top-Grade Help for Plan to Increase Computer Use	President Clinton sought to build support today for his $2.3 billion initiative to bridge what he calls the digital divide by convening computer executives, including Stephen M. Case of America Online, at an inner-city high school struggling to wire all its computers to the World Wide Web. Mr. Clinton said the budget proposal he would unveil next week, which requires Congressional approval, will include tax incentives of $2 billion over 10 years as well as expanded grants to encourage the private sector to donate computers, sponsor technology centers in poor neighborhoods and train those not yet connected to the Web.
1/31/2000	Not-So-Subtle Engine Drives AOL Profit Forecasts	IF America Online completes its acquisition of Time Warner, a one-year clock would immediately start ticking. America Online promised investors that in the first year as a combined company, it would add an extra $1 billion in pretax operating profits beyond the $10 billion total the companies would have earned separately.
1/31/2000	Digital Commerce; As the information, entertainment and communications industries converge, concern over access is growing.	THE huge potential power of the proposed AOL Time Warner has applied electroshock to the cortex of the convergence industries: information, entertainment and communication. One of the biggest jolts is being felt in the growing market for high-speed, or broadband, Internet services. Combining the world's largest Internet service provider with the world's largest news, entertainment and cable television megalith has set off increasingly urgent discussions about the future of broadband and how best to ensure that no single company abuses its control of the Internet's infrastructure.
1/27/2000	Subway Talk	To the Editor: Matthew Purdy's column ''Don't Know Online Talk? cu latr'' (Our Towns, Jan. 26) certainly confirms the adage ''everything old is new again.''
1/24/2000	Media; Time and Fortune play catch up -- ever so carefully -- on the AOL-Time Warner deal.	IT was around cocktail hour on the Sunday night before Time Warner and America Online announced the big deal that Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., heard the news. Mr. Pearlstine said he was first surprised, and then daunted by the frustrating task of covering the news after he had just put all of his magazines to bed. ''Fortune had closed 48 hours earlier and Time had closed 24 hours earlier,'' he said last week. ''We were left playing catch up.''
1/20/2000	America Online Posts Gain In Second-Quarter Income	With subscriptions and advertising sales growing briskly, America Online handily beat Wall Street's expectations in its most recent quarter, reporting a profit of $271 million yesterday, up from $115 million a year earlier. The company earned 10 cents a share, beating the 8 cents analysts had forecast and matching the ''whisper number.''
1/19/2000	When Corporate Synergy Becomes Manifest Destiny	It was a scoop for Jim Lehrer. Within hours of the announcement of America Online's agreement to purchase Time Warner, the two chief mergees showed up for an interview. (In an image reversal, America Online's Steven M. Case was the one with the necktie, Time Warner's Gerald M. Levin the one without, inviting speculation that the $165 billion purchase price had included his tie.) Instead of further torturing the technological ramifications of this marriage of the Internet to an entertainment and information empire and its implications for the stock market, which had been occupying the cable business channels since the announcement, Mr. Lehrer, in his customary common-sense way, wanted to know what the merger meant for the mere television viewer.
1/18/2000	Online Music Gets a Lift In AOL Deal With Warner	For the music industry, the combination of America Online and Time Warner has struck a chord. It promises to hasten the coming of the day when music is distributed digitally through the Internet rather than through record stores. But that chord does not sound the death knell of record stores just yet. Many obstacles must be overcome before consumers routinely download music instead of buying compact discs. And there is a limit to how much one company -- even one as potentially powerful as AOL Time Warner -- can influence the evolution of technology.
1/16/2000	Price of Joining Old and New Was Core Issue in AOL Deal	The journey to last week's announcement that America Online would buy Time Warner in history's largest merger began last fall and included secret meetings in New York and Boston and a key dinner on Jan. 6 at the home of Stephen M. Case, the chairman of America Online. But the turning point for the deal came not at a dinner or a power breakfast, but over the New Year's holiday in the solitude of the small library of the Vermont vacation home of Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner. It was there, where Mr. Levin says he does his best thinking, that the chairman of the world's largest media company finally decided he would accept less than half ownership of the combined company.
1/14/2000	The Bad Business of Media Mergers	When Steve Case of America Online announced his purchase this week of Time Warner, he listed the new company's activities in the following order: First there was entertainment. Then there was e-commerce. Down the list a ways came journalism. The news coverage probing the potential impact of this deal on journalism has focused generally on whether reporters and editors will face new conflicts of interest. Won't an otherwise independent reporter for Fortune, Time, Money or CNN now have interests that will interfere with that independence when he or she reports on AOL?
1/14/2000	AOL Merger: Privacy Concerns	To the Editor: As a civil libertarian, I have misgivings about the America Online-Time Warner merger (front page, Jan. 11) that rest on AOL's bad track record on protection of individual privacy, its proprietary assertion of rights to monitor e-mail and chat, its willingness to censor Internet message boards, and the potential for sharing information.
1/14/2000	AOL Merger Is Unlikely to Reshape Asian Internet Business	It was hardly Paris, but Shanghai played a part in the brief, intense courtship between America Online and Time Warner. America Online's chairman, Stephen M. Case, attended a Fortune magazine conference there in October, during which he mingled with Time Warner's top executives, including Gerald M. Levin and Ted Turner. Later, the executives traveled to Beijing for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. A Time Warner executive who was there recalls a teasing exchange between Mr. Case and Mr. Turner, when the two found themselves stranded in the rain outside the Great Hall of the People.
1/14/2000	AOL Merger: Privacy Concerns	To the Editor: Robert H. Frank (Op-Ed, Jan. 11) is correct to argue that investments in enhancing the quality of product will be an important weapon in the coming media market battle. But Mr. Frank is wrong to see grabbing customers from other services as the be-all and end-all of media competition.
1/13/2000	AOL Tries to Cover All the Bases In Securing Many Domain Names	Before America Online Inc. announced it would acquire Time Warner Inc. for $165 billion, it made sure it had the right Web site. AOL registered at least 21 domain names that might be useful to the new company, which will be named AOL Time Warner. The sites the company registered on Sunday ranged from AOLTW.com to AmericaOnlineTimeWarner.com.
1/13/2000	The Assets Of 2 Concerns Tied to Those In Big Deal	If the fortunes of Time Warner and America Online are tied up in the success of their proposed merger, the assets of at least two other media companies will be directly affected by the deal. The Tribune Company, the publishers of The Chicago Tribune and owners of 18 television stations, has the most at stake. It has a 25 percent stake in Time Warner's WB network, whose increasing popularity and revenue had helped push Tribune's stock price above $60 in November from its 1998 low of slightly below $23, though it has since fallen off that peak, closing yesterday at $51.25.
1/13/2000	Questions Abound as Media Influence Grows for a Handful	In 1983, Ben H. Bagdikian, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaperman, wrote in his book ''The Media Monopoly'' (Beacon Press) that a mere 50 companies controlled most of what Americans read in books, magazines and newspapers and watched on television and at the movies. For the book's sixth edition due in March, that number has shrunk to six.
1/13/2000	Editorial Observer; Does It Matter Who Owns What?	Is the map really being redrawn, or have the countries just changed colors? That's the question that comes to mind after yet another largest-ever media merger, AOL's $165 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Does it make a difference that all the entities once owned separately by AOL and Time Warner will soon be owned by them jointly? Put that way, the answer seems to be no. It isn't hard to see the logic in this deal, nor is it hard to sense the enormous forces that pulled these companies together. With such a high degree of consolidation in the media and Internet sectors, it's possible to argue that a little more merging isn't going to do much harm. But the AOL-Time Warner merger isn't just a little more consolidation. I don't know how to measure the physics of a deal like this, but it feels as though this merger is less the sum of adding two companies together than the product of multiplying them. It is hard to stipulate the unknown, which is one of the attractions, and one of the worries, of this deal. Steve Case, the C.E.O. of AOL, and Gerald Levin, the C.E.O. of Time Warner, have tried to forestall the anxiety this merger causes by asserting that it is a social good, by promising to guarantee open access to cable subscribers, and by reminding us that even corporations this enormous actually have people in them.
1/13/2000	Firms' Multimillion-Dollar Fees For Big Merger Are Just a Start	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. are likely to reap about $50 million each for helping broker the largest merger in history -- and that's just the start. America Online Inc.'s $165 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. eventually may yield another $100 million in fees for the two banks, whose role in the transaction makes them front-runners to advise the new AOL Time Warner Inc. in the future, analysts said. The banks may be asked to help AOL Time Warner sell businesses. and rejigger assets and liabilities.
1/13/2000	Investors Seem to Want to Keep AOL-Time Warner Asunder	America Online and Time Warner announced their engagement on Monday, for richer or for poorer. Yesterday, investors decided the combination was for poorer, sending shares of the two companies plunging for the second consecutive day. The combined market value of America Online and Time Warner is now less than before the deal was announced.
1/12/2000	Bertelsmann's Chairman to Leave Board of AOL	The chairman of Bertelsmann A.G., Thomas Middelhoff, said today that he would step down from the board of America Online as a result of its proposed takeover of Time Warner. His decision is a suggestion of the jolt that the extraordinary deal has inflicted on Bertelsmann, which is the world's fourth-largest media company and which has a joint venture with America Online in Europe and Australia.
1/12/2000	Established Media Companies Are Nervous in Wake of Pact	In the dizzy aftermath of a deal that made Time Warner, an established media company, the prospective junior partner of a new media giant, America Online, executives of other older media companies are proclaiming that the value of their information has been vindicated. Private conversations, however, made it clear that there is nervousness amid the public jubilation. At least one executive speculated on the danger that an older media company that moved too slowly would become marginalized, ending up a wallflower at the global dance, while the likes of Gannett Inc., Times Mirror or Dow Jones & Company might be waltzing with Yahoo, AT&T or Amazon.com.
1/12/2000	A Bridge Builder For Corporate Culture	When Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive, urged the assembled press corps earlier this week to look at the body language among the executives on stage as proof of how harmoniously his company would blend with America Online, the row of men in the spotlight fidgeted in uncomfortable silence. Then Robert W. Pittman, president of America Online, leaned back and put his arms around his Time Warner neighbors. If the gesture did not necessarily provide assurance of a happy cultural mesh, it did draw laughter and managed to defuse an awkward moment.
1/12/2000	A Rush to Provide High-Speed Internet Access	For most Americans, linking to cyberspace from home is akin to trying to eat a vat of thick, rich soup with a straw. With their $165 billion merger deal, America Online and Time Warner intend to start handing out ladles. The agreement between America Online, the No. 1 Internet provider, and Time Warner, the media and cable television titan, is reverberating throughout the communications and media industries. But the most important impact for consumers may be how the deal advances the deployment of high-speed Internet access.
1/12/2000	Two Stocks: One Swings, the Other Doesn't	PICKUP trucks can be great vehicles. So can sports cars. But their virtues are very different, and fans of one may not love the other. That may help explain why Day 2 of the America Online-Time Warner deal sent stock prices of both companies tumbling, with each down $5 or more a share. The value of the stock that America Online is offering for Time Warner, at $165 billion when the deal was announced, leaped to $180 billion in early trading Monday but was down to $145.1 billion by the end of trading Tuesday.
1/12/2000	By Any Measure, a Big Deal	There is no question that the deal proposed on Monday by America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. would be the biggest corporate combination in American history. How much it would be worth is a different matter. A press release issued by the companies called it a $350 billion deal. But few, if any, media reports agreed on the value, with price tags ranging from $156.14 billion to $335 billion, depending on how the math was done.
1/12/2000	Merger May Produce the Rival Microsoft Has Always Dreaded	To the company's adversaries, the very name ''Microsoft'' suggests menacing power. It has been called the Death Star, an 800-pound gorilla and far worse. And in the government's sweeping antitrust case, the Microsoft Corporation was portrayed in convincing detail as a monopolistic bully. America Online Inc., in particular, was bent to Microsoft's will, according to court testimony.
1/12/2000	Reckonings; Media Mania	As a former columnist for Fortune, I am probably one of the few people who regularly visited the unsuccessful Pathfinder portal. And I can heartily endorse the claim that Time Warner needed someone else's expertise to develop its Internet profile. The Fortune site, part of Pathfinder, was deeply flawed in at least two ways: Much of it was in unreadable yellow type (when I inquired about that, I was told it looked better on a Macintosh, suggesting a slight lack of consumer orientation), and it failed to include the kind of content that might have attracted readers -- that is, it didn't post my columns. Well, presumably AOL Time Warner content will no longer be pale yellow. But that does not explain why Time Warner was willing to be bought by a company that, by every measure except market valuation, is a mere fraction of its own size. So let me try to answer the big questions raised by this deal.
1/11/2000	The Online Generation Courts the Old Guard	When Stephen M. Case, the chief executive of America Online, called Gerald M. Levin, chief executive of Time Warner last October to suggest a merger, it was not clear that they would have much to talk about. America Online was a prickly suitor, having already rebuffed overtures from AT&T. And while Mr. Case had spent two years on the prowl for a major-league partner in the mainstream telecommunications and media world, he was unwilling to get together with just any admirer of his high-flying Internet concern.
1/11/2000	The Biggest Media Merger Yet	Everything about the $165 billion takeover of Time Warner by America Online is big. AOL is the largest Internet company. Time Warner is the largest media and entertainment company. Their proposed marriage will be the largest corporate merger in history. The implications of this merger are big too, for the way stocks are valued, for the way information services reach consumers, and perhaps for the way entertainment, politics and journalism evolve in a 21st-century corporate environment. Some parts of the picture are clearer than others. The Internet stock boom looks less ephemeral today. For the consumer the deal poses no grave threat, because the companies operate in separate businesses. With or without the merger, consumers will eventually get a broad range of Internet services over high-speed cable wires. They will now get these services more quickly and probably more cheaply, and with a broader choice.
1/11/2000	A Merger's Message: Dominate or Die	Business lore has it that Jack Welch, the chairman of General Electric, called his division heads together at one point during the 1980's and told them to abandon any product that was not one of the top three in its particular market. Pursuing that strategy has made the company one of the most successful conglomerates in American business history. The same logic helps to explain why an Internet access provider like America Online would want to merge with a traditional media conglomerate like Time Warner. The domain of entertainment and communications, even more than G.E.'s world of manufacturing, has become an environment where success breeds success. The technological imperative is to dominate or perish.
1/11/2000	Takeover May Increase U.S. Control of Internet in Europe	The Internet may well be borderless, but it remains remarkably American. Here in Europe, America Online's prospective takeover of Time Warner is likely to accentuate that phenomenon and increase pressure among rivals for alliances and mergers. America Online and Bertelsmann A.G. of Germany are partners in AOL Europe, which operates local-language networks across the Continent.
1/11/2000	Does Deal Signal Lessening Of Media Independence?	For those inclined to chew over the future of journalism and the freedom of information, it was feast time yesterday. The merger of Time Warner, the biggest of the old-media companies, with America Online, the biggest of the new, renewed the concern that news outlets are losing their independence. And it fanned the newer concerns that the Internet, the garden in which a thousand sources of information would bloom, had itself become prey to the corporate consolidations. The worry is not that there are fewer media outlets -- the opposite is true -- but that few people have ultimate control over them.
1/11/2000	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING	THE $165 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. by America Online Inc. could well be a transformative transaction, say senior managers at leading agencies, remaking the advertising, marketing and media landscapes as few deals have done. ''Mark this date down,'' Page Thompson, worldwide media director at DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, said yesterday as Madison Avenue learned details of the record takeover. ''This is the beginning of a huge change in the paradigm of how media are consumed, planned and bought.''
1/11/2000	For Holders Big and Small, an Explosion of Riches	Ted Turner is knocking on the door of the $10 billion club. Mr. Turner, the cable television pioneer who is vice chairman of Time Warner, has more to gain than anybody from a sale of the company to America Online. He is the biggest individual shareholder of Time Warner, owning about 100 million shares, or about 6.7 percent of the company.
1/11/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; AOL Time Warner may inflate Internet stock values even more. Yet its own could falter.	WHEN Time Inc. acquired Warner Communications 10 years ago, it took seven years for shareholders in the combined company to see any meaningful gain in their stock. Will shareholders in a merged AOL Time Warner see better returns? News of the deal sent Time Warner shares soaring yesterday morning to a high of $102, a 58 percent gain from their close on Friday. By the end of the day, the stock was trading at $90. America Online's shares rose to $80 early in the day but closed at $71.25, down nearly 3 percent.
1/11/2000	AOL Chief Relaxes a Dress Code But Not His Vision of the Internet	Perhaps the only thing stranger than having America Online's chairman and chief executive, Stephen M. Case, announce plans yesterday to assume the helm of the world's largest media conglomerate was the fact that he wore a suit and tie to do it. After all, Mr. Case, 41, heads an Internet company perpetually thought to be doomed and is known for clinging to his casual costume of denim shirts and khakis on even the most formal occasions. But if his attire changes with his company's acquisition of Time Warner, it should come as no surprise. Since the days of 300-baud modems, Mr. Case has survived the Internet's accelerated evolution with a series of transformations. His deal with Time Warner is only the most recent.
1/11/2000	When Everything New Becomes Dizzingly Newer	The combination of America Online and Time Warner would create a colossus that could force competitors from the Walt Disney Company to AT&T to Microsoft to reconsider their strategies. The deal, announced yesterday, leaves Disney, the News Corporation, Seagram, NBC, Viacom-CBS and other, smaller old-media companies with a stark choice. They can try to carve a future alone on the Internet, a place that has so far been inhospitable to old-media companies. Or they can merge with new- media companies like Yahoo, putting their future in the hands of businesses that hardly existed five years ago.
1/11/2000	AMERICA ONLINE AGREES TO BUY TIME WARNER FOR $165 BILLION; MEDIA DEAL IS RICHEST MERGER	America Online, the company that brought the Internet to the masses, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the largest traditional media company, Time Warner, for $165 billion in what would be the biggest merger in history and the best evidence yet that old and new media are converging. By agreeing to give up its independence in return for an ample premium on its stock price, Time Warner is acknowledging that the Internet is central to its music, publishing and TV businesses and that its own efforts to create online operations have been lackluster. Under the direction of its 41-year-old chairman and chief executive, Stephen M. Case, America Online, despite the occasional stumble, has surged far ahead of its online competitors, largely on the strength of its marketing skill and ability to make technology easy to use.
1/11/2000	Medium for Main Street	The merger of America Online and Time Warner represents not only the triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, but a vision of the Web as a mass-marketed, middle-of-the-road medium for Main Street America. Though top executives of both companies presented the deal as a ''merger of equals,'' it was in fact a victory for Stephen M. Case, the 41-year-old billionaire who built America Online from a fledgling dial-up service in the mid-1980's to an Internet powerhouse able to acquire the world's largest media company.
1/11/2000	Leading Time Warner's Digital Makeover	In the pantheon of prominent media executives, Gerald M. Levin has long had a reputation as a shrewd gambler with a scholarly mien: bookish, cerebral, self-effacing and yet tough. True to form, the new chief executive of the hybrid of Time Warner and America Online showed up without a tie yesterday for a New York news conference to announce the planned merger, issuing a formal greeting to what he called ''the suits from Virginia'' -- the more formally dressed executives from America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va.
1/11/2000	Potentially Big Effect Seen on Varied Units Of AOL Time Warner	The AOL-Time Warner merger was such a closely guarded secret that even the journalists who work for Time Warner, from its magazines like Time, Fortune and Money to its television channels like CNN, had no inkling it was about to happen. But it became clear as the news spread yesterday that the deal would have a potentially enormous effect on the company's individual units. The most immediate was seen for CNN, which would benefit from the promotional strength offered by AOL's treasure of 22 million subscribers. A huge effect, if not immediate, is also expected for Time Warner's music division, which will become the first major record company to be so closely affiliated with an Internet company through an ability to deliver music online.
1/11/2000	Luce's Magazine Was First Information 'Portal'	Does this story sound familiar? A young man borrows money from friends and family to start a company that he contends will revolutionize the world and end information overload for the majority of Americans. After some lean years, he becomes one of the richest and most powerful men in the world, and his company dominates its field. No, this is not the story of William H. Gates of Microsoft, or even Stephen M. Case at America Online. The hero of this tale is Henry R. Luce, who with Briton Hadden founded Time Inc. in the early 1920's. Since then, Time has been in the forefront of almost every technological change in what is now called the media business, but back then was known as newspapering.
1/8/2000	New Access to America Online E-Mail	America Online Inc. said this week that it would give its more than 20 million subscribers access to electronic mail using hand-held organizers made by the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Casio Computer Company and the Hewlett-Packard Company. America Online, based in Dulles, Va., said in June that it would place its e-mail service on the Palm hand-held computers of 3Com Corporation.
1/2/2000	Hacker Sentenced	Raymond Satiro, 19, of New Rochelle, who pleaded guilty to hacking into America Online's internal computers, was sentenced Dec. 21 in Westchester County Court in White Plains to a year in prison and five years without a home computer. David Hebert, a spokesman for the county's district attorney's office, said Mr. Satiro, known to his friends as Jay, used his knowledge of America Online and information from other hackers to break into the service's internal computer system and alter data and programs by installing programs of his own. The damage was extensive, requiring expensive repairs, Mr. Hebert said.
12/17/1999	As Sales Boom Online, Some Customers Boo; Beam Us Down to Earth, Scotty: E-tailers Rush to Form Alliances With More Traditional Retailers	Electronic commerce, explosive as it is, clearly cannot keep growing by going solo. Convinced that they cannot grab the next generation of Web users without each other, Internet companies and the biggest earthbound retailers have buried the hatchet and are rushing to do business together. In the latest such partnerships, Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, and Best Buy, the nation's largest electronics merchant, both announced far-reaching alliances with Internet companies yesterday.
12/15/1999	3Com Up on Plan To Spin Off Palm	Shares of the 3Com Corporation rose as much as 16 percent today after its Palm Inc. unit, the maker of electronic organizers, filed for an initial public offering and said that Nokia, Motorola and America Online would buy shares. 3Com rose $5.8125, or about 13 percent, to $50.625 in heavy trading. The shares touched $52.1875, their highest since October 1997. The rest of Palm will be spun off to 3Com shareholders six months after the initial offering, which will be for less than 20 percent of the company.
11/17/1999	Volunteers Log On, Help Out	Janice Maly
11/17/1999	AMERICA ONLINE IN BRAZIL	Moving to tap Brazil's fast-growing Internet market, America Online began its first Portuguese-language service in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. America Online will lend its brand name and technology to the venture, while its partner in Latin America, the Cisneros Group of Venezuela, will inject $100 million of investment. America Online plans Spanish-language services in Argentina and Mexico. Simon Romero
11/5/1999	Advocates for Blind, in Suit, Say AOL Impedes Access to Internet	National Federation of Blind, arguing that virtual spaces must be as accessible to people with disabilities as are physical spaces, files suit against America Online; says online service is almost impossible for blind people to use (M)
10/27/1999	In High Technology, the Grind Evolves	In May 1994, Jeff Treuhaft, 25, joined a little Silicon Valley start-up called Mosaic, later to be renamed the Netscape Communications Corporation. The pace was brutal -- 18 hours a day, seven days a week in the early months -- but the work was exhilarating. ''The really tough part was that my son was 9 weeks old when I started at Netscape,'' he recalled.
10/21/1999	AOL Exceeds Expectations; Agrees to Invest In a PC Maker	Expanding its growing domain into the PC market, America Online punctuated a stronger-than-expected earnings report yesterday by announcing that it would invest $800 million in Gateway Inc., taking a 5 percent stake in the maker of consumer computers. The investment will be made over two years and will be paid for in part with $180 million in America Online stock. In return, Gateway will offer America Online membership to new PC customers.
10/5/1999	Travelocity Makes a Deal To Dominate Web Market	Travelocity, the on-line travel service, said yesterday that it would acquire a smaller rival, Preview Travel, in a deal that will vault it past Microsoft's Expedia to be the largest travel site on the Web. Travelocity is part of the Sabre Group, the reservation system that is controlled by the AMR Corporation, American Airlines' parent. Because Preview Travel is a publicly traded company, the deal would allow Sabre to spin off Travelocity as a separate company without the expense of an initial public stock offering.
10/1/1999	Who's on First at Excite@Home, Anyway?	The board of the Excite@Home Corporation yesterday canceled a meeting set for Monday to vote on splitting the company's Excite Web portal from the At Home cable modem venture, apparently because Cox Communications Inc., one of the venture's big shareholders, threatened to veto the plan, an executive close to Excite@Home said yesterday. It has been clear since the summer that the AT&T Corporation, the biggest shareholder in Excite@Home, does not believe that Excite and At Home belong together and that AT&T has been considering a deal to give America Online Inc. enhanced access to AT&T's widespread cable television systems.
9/30/1999	America Online Enters Hong Kong With Eye on Mainland	Stephen M. Case has planted his flag in Hong Kong, but his gaze is fixed on the Chinese mainland. Mr. Case, the founder and chairman of America Online Inc., was here this week to introduce his company's newest Internet service, AOL Hong Kong. The service -- a partnership with a highflying local Internet provider, the China.com Corporation -- will offer the usual menu of AOL services, plus a dollop of home-grown features like Cantonese pop music, Chinese cooking tips and horse-racing forums.
9/28/1999	America Online Unit to Reduce Subscription Costs in Britain	Hoping to stem its market slide in Britain, America Online said today that it would lower the monthly cost of subscribing to its service here. AOL will charge users one British penny a minute, or 1.65 cents, in addition to the monthly subscription fee of 9.99 [pounds], or $16.45, making it more competitive with Freeserve P.L.C., the British market leader, which requires only the cost of a local phone call to connect to the Internet.
9/24/1999	2 Providers Of Net Access Set to Merge	Earthlink Network Inc. and Mindspring Enterprises Inc., two pioneers in the business of selling Internet access, announced a merger agreement yesterday, with hopes of more effectively challenging America Online. The merger, a $1.7 billion stock swap, creates a company with 2.8 million subscribers. It will be named Earthlink but will operate out of Atlanta, Mindspring's home. Earthlink is now based in Pasadena, Calif.
9/11/1999	Andreessen Steps Down From AOL	Marc Andreessen, who became an icon of the Internet age as a co-founder of the Netscape Communications Corporation before it was acquired by America Online last year, is stepping down after seven months as America Online's chief technology officer, the company said yesterday. In his place, the company hired William J. Raduchel, the chief strategist of Sun Microsystems.
8/25/1999	THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Bertelsmann Sells America Online Shares	Bertelsmann AG sells 7.2 million shares of America Online Inc, valued at $714.2 million, in order to raise money to finance expansion of its own multimedia businesses (S)
8/25/1999	Privacy Questions Raised in Cases Of Syphilis Linked to Chat Room	In what health officials believe is the first time a disease cluster has been traced to cyberspace, the department of public health here has tracked an outbreak of syphilis cases to an America Online chat room. Officials from the San Francisco Department of Public Health said six men who had contracted syphilis in the last three months have traced their last sexual encounters to partners they met through a chat room created by an America Online member, San Francisco Men 4 Men (SFM4M). The case is a new development for public health officials who traditionally define an affected group by the members' physical proximity or relation and poses a question for the electronic age: when does the right to on-line privacy yield to public health issues?
8/25/1999	America Online Offers Free Internet Use in Britain	America Online Inc. introduced its own free Internet service in Britain today, with the goal of overtaking the growing crowd of competitors that already offer customers access to the World Wide Web at no charge. The new service, known as Netscape Online, is managed by AOL Europe, a joint venture of America Online and Bertelsmann A.G., the large German media conglomerate. First announced last month, Netscape Online represents a strategic about-face for America Online, which had historically relied on monthly subscriptions and only three months ago questioned whether Britain's free-subscription businesses could be sustained.
8/19/1999	Another Twist in Skirmish Over Instant Messaging	In its latest tweak at America Online, the Microsoft Corporation announced today that it would release a computer protocol to enable subscribers of competing instant-messaging services to communicate with its own customers. Microsoft officials said the move was intended to pave the way for communication among subscribers of the handful of major companies offering instant messaging, a feature that allows computer users to contact one another instantaneously and chat on line.
8/17/1999	MCI Net Snag Could Drive Small Providers Out of Business	The 10-day partial shutdown of MCI Worldcom's high-speed data network took a cataclysmic toll on dozens and possibly hundreds of small Internet service providers who were forced to close altogether last week. Some say they may go out of business as a result. These mom-and-pop players, along with more than a quarter of all Internet service providers nationally, rely on MCI to route subscribers onto the Internet.
8/16/1999	Small Internet Providers Survive Among the Giants	America Online is the undisputed king of Internet service providers, having added 5.1 million members the last year alone, for a total of more than 17 million subscribers. But its growth rate masks a remarkable trend: the company's share of the Internet-access market is no longer growing as it once was and may, in fact, be declining. The market for Internet service providers, or I.S.P.'s, rather than consolidating around America Online, Microsoft and telephone companies like AT&T as many industry observers had predicted, remains a diverse industry with wide open possibilities for competitors, including mom-and-pop operations.
8/13/1999	Microsoft Says Worker Wrote Smear of Rival	The Microsoft Corporation acknowledged yesterday that one of its programmers apparently masqueraded as an independent computer consultant earlier this week in an effort to discredit America Online's tactics in the companies' quarrel over instant messaging. Microsoft had reason to be red-faced about the incident yesterday -- first, because the company was unable to identify the employee who forged an E-mail message on Tuesday accusing America Online of irresponsible behavior, and second, because whoever did it sent the message to the one computer security expert who was most likely to trace it back to Microsoft.
7/23/1999	Microsoft Tells Analysts The Future Is Good, Sort Of	In summing up its year for financial analysts and investors today, a supremely confident Microsoft Corporation gave few indications that it felt embattled in its legal struggle with the Justice Department over antitrust issues. In fact, it defiantly asserted that these are the best of times for the PC industry. At its annual meeting for analysts, the company has traditionally warned Wall Street of potential doom and gloom on the horizon. But this year, on the heels of a fourth-quarter report showing overall margins of about 38 percent, the usual warnings seemed to lack conviction.
7/22/1999	Lowe Wins Part Of iPlanet Account	The San Francisco office of Lowe & Partners/SMS has been awarded the off-line account of iPlanet, a new venture that offers software for Internet commerce. It is part of an alliance of Sun Microsystems and the Netscape Communications Corporation unit of America Online; Lowe is part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $20 million.
7/22/1999	2 Internet Companies Have Solid Quarter	Despite a slowdown in the growth of on-line use in the spring, two of the largest Internet companies reported results yesterday that largely confirmed analysts' expectations for the quarter ending on June 30. America Online, the dominant provider of Internet services for home users, earned $160 million, slightly ahead of expectations, as its advertising revenue grew briskly.
7/8/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Nasdaq's Tarzan Complex; Big Swings in Opening Prices Prompt Calls for Change	When DrKoop.com announced an $89 million deal on Tuesday to provide its health-information services to the 17 million subscribers of America Online, investors rushed to trade both stocks. Those who bought and sold America Online shares in the opening minutes of trading all got close to the same price, but those who traded DrKoop.com got prices that varied by as much as $2 a share on a $35 stock. The early-morning volatility illustrates not just the power of the Internet but also the sharp differences in how stocks are traded on the Nasdaq stock market, which is home to DrKoop.com, and on the New York Stock Exchange, where America Online shares are listed. Some big traders and institutional investors say the way Nasdaq opens trading each day has bred chaos, and they are calling for change.
6/25/1999	As Testimony Ends, Microsoft's Judge Waits for Motions	The heated accusations of monopoly, the lively E-mail flavored with capitalist aggression and the spirited testimony alleging and denying misconduct came to a close today as the last witness stepped off the stand in the Microsoft antitrust trial, eight months after proceedings began. The trial is by no means over, but it will sharply shift gears as the daily theater in the courtroom gives way to a more sober weighing of facts and law. ''Now the showmanship ends and the legal maneuvering really begins,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a Howard University law professor.
6/25/1999	Gates Memo Deals a Blow To Microsoft	The absent star made a final appearance in the Microsoft antitrust trial today when a Government lawyer introduced as evidence a comment by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, that knocked the legs from under his legal team's most important defensive strategy. Mr. Gates has not appeared as a witness at his company's trial. Nonetheless, he has exerted tremendous influence on the proceedings -- most often in a manner that helped the Government make its case.
6/23/1999	3Com Posts Earnings Above Predictions	The 3Com Corporation reported fourth-quarter earnings today that came in a penny above analysts' expectations based on strong growth in products used to manage data flow over networks. For the quarter ended May 26, 3Com had net income of $87.5 million, or 24 cents a diluted share, up 38 percent from $63.6 million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 3 percent, to $1.42 billion from $1.375 billion.
6/22/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Fund's Quick Slide From First to (Almost) Worst	In April, Janus 20 sat atop the mutual fund world. It was the best performer of any large stock fund, having doubled investors' money since the start of 1998. And it had taken in so much money so fast -- nearly $7 billion in four months -- that Janus said it would close the fund to ''deliver superior performance.'' Now, the fund has once more earned a prominent place on the performance charts -- this time, at the bottom. In fact, through Thursday, it ranked as the 15th-worst-performing general equity fund of 4,008 funds in the second quarter, according to Lipper, the Summit, N.J., mutual fund data company.
6/22/1999	America Online to Put $1.5 Billion Into a Hughes Alliance	America Online will invest $1.5 billion in Hughes Electronics as part of a wide-ranging alliance that will allow the on-line service to offer high-speed Internet access using the Hughes satellite data delivery system, the companies said today. Under the agreement, which is a broadening of a deal announced by the companies a month ago, Hughes will market AOL TV, an interactive television service, to the seven million subscribers of its DirecTV satellite television service. In turn, America Online will market DirecTV and DirecPC, Hughes's high-speed, satellite-based Internet access service, to its 16 million American subscribers.
6/21/1999	Potential Rival Remains Wary of Microsoft's Power	As Stephen M. Case, chief executive of America Online, contemplated making the biggest deal of his career -- the purchase of Netscape Communications -- he stopped for a moment last fall to ponder whether his company could finally afford to dump Microsoft. Two years earlier, America Online executives were thinking they had no choice but to use the Microsoft Corporation's browser instead of Netscape's as the default for their millions of customers. Microsoft had made an offer they could not refuse -- a high-profile spot on the Windows desktop.
6/15/1999	Microsoft Witness Keeps People Off Edges of Their Seats	The Microsoft Corporation put its most important rebuttal witness in the Government's antitrust trial on the stand today, a senior executive from America Online, and set out to prove that the on-line service had deceived the judge about its plans to compete with Microsoft. But the effort proved to be a bust in terms of how it played in court.
6/3/1999	In Spanish and Portuguese, Web Growth Spurt	IN January, Anna Spinello, a clothing designer in Buenos Aires, set up a Web site to help boost sales of her spring line. By clicking on a little flag, a viewer can see the site in English, Spanish or Portuguese. ''Considering we haven't publicized it, we've had an amazing response,'' said her son Francesco Spinello, 42, who manages the small, family-run business (www.annaspinello.com) that sells to boutiques in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. ''We've made a lot of contacts that should pay off with the next collection.''
6/2/1999	America Online Strikes Deal for 2 Internet Music Companies	Pledging to make tuning in easier as it stakes a claim in the growing market for on-line music, America Online said yesterday that it would buy two Internet music companies, Spinner Networks Inc. and Nullsoft Inc., for a total of $400 million in stock. The acquisitions by America Online, the largest Internet service provider, underscore the growing popularity of playing and listening to music over the Internet. Once limited to dedicated music fans who were also technology buffs, it is expected to increase significantly as the faster Internet connections that enhance audio quality become more widely available over the next few years.
5/27/1999	Making I.S.P. Choices	To the Editor: Your article (May 20) gives me hope that I will eventually get a I.S.P. that won't cut off in the middle of an involved E-mail, in daytime, nonprime, nonbusy time. This happened recently on America Online. At 1:30 P.M., yet! Your article has given me the incentive to switch I.S.P.'s. GENE SLOANE Evanston, Ill., May 20, 1999
5/26/1999	Former Volunteers Sue AOL, Seeking Back Pay for Work	Two former volunteers for America Online have filed a lawsuit in Federal Court in Manhattan in an attempt to obtain back wages, saying that they and thousands of other volunteers should have been compensated for their work. The plaintiffs, Kelly Hallisey of Nassau County and Brian Williams of Dallas, allege that AOL violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, a Federal law that mandates a minimum hourly wage for employees, by using volunteers to perform work for the on-line service.
5/22/1999	Depositions Continue in Microsoft Case	Midway through a deposition today, Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, looked quizzically at the Microsoft lawyer who was questioning him and asked, ''Did I wander into the wrong room?'' The Microsoft Corporation deposed Mr. Case this morning as part of its preparations for the rebuttal phase of the antitrust trial against the software giant, which is scheduled to resume June 1 after a three-month recess. Many of the questions centered on America Online's Internet business strategy, leading Mr. Case to wonder aloud what on earth any of it had to do with the anticompetitive charges against Microsoft that are at issue in the case.
5/17/1999	What This Has Been All About.com	It was a few days before Miningco.com was scheduled to go public in March. Scott Kurnit, the company's founder and chief executive, called its lawyer to ask whether there was any law that prevented a company, on the day it goes public, from changing its name. Not exactly, the lawyer said -- but if he was going to do that, Mr. Kurnit should alert Bear, Stearns, the investment bank managing the offering.
5/12/1999	America Online Challenges Microsoft's WebTV	Only weeks after completing the purchase of the Netscape Communications Corporation -- the Microsoft Corporation's archrival in Web browsing software -- America Online Inc. announced yesterday that it would take on Microsoft in delivering the Internet over television sets. The new product, to be known as AOL TV, will compete directly with Microsoft's WebTV, which already has about 800,000 users.
5/6/1999	Microsoft Presses Rival on Details of a Deal	A lawyer for Microsoft tried to make the case today that America Online planned to use ''all of its marketing muscle'' to promote its newly acquired product, the Netscape Navigator Web browser. But an America Online executive disputed that, saying the company thought ''the browser business is dead.'' The back and forth came this morning as Microsoft took the deposition of Barry Schuler, the president for interactive services at America Online, in preparation for the resumption of the antitrust trial late this month.
5/4/1999	List of Final Witnesses Released in Microsoft Trial	The Microsoft Corporation and the Government both released the names today of the final witnesses each intends to call when the antitrust trial resumes later this month. The list indicates that the Government hopes to shore up its case, while Microsoft's goal, at least in part, is to change the subject of discussion to one that might make the Government's case seem irrelevant. The most surprising announcement came from Microsoft. The company is summoning David Colburn -- a senior executive for America Online and an important Government witness earlier in the trial -- to testify as a hostile witness in the final, rebuttal stage of testimony.
4/29/1999	Microsoft Questions Delay in Announcement of a Merger Last Year	A lawyer for the Microsoft Corporation tried today to show that the Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online delayed the announcement of their merger for several weeks last fall, apparently because they feared that earlier disclosure of it might hurt the Government's antitrust case against Microsoft. In an attempt to suggest a plot between the two companies and the Government to keep their intentions from Microsoft's legal team, the lawyer, Michael Lacovara, questioned Peter Currie, a senior vice president for Netscape, for more than two hours. The deposition was the first of several that will be taken to prepare rebuttal arguments for the trial, which is in recess.
4/28/1999	Metro Business; ABC to Leave Web Site	Walt Disney Company's ABC television network said it would not renew a contract that put its on-line sports and entertainment news on the Web site of America Online, the No. 1 Internet service provider. ABC, which has provided sports and entertainment news and information to AOL's sites since 1994, is to quit doing so by the end of the week. ABC removed its national news content from AOL in January, after AOL replaced it with news from rival CBS.
4/27/1999	Foreign Affairs; Judgment Not Included	Articles about the shootings at Columbine High School contained two sets of initials you don't often see together: N.R.A. and AOL. That the N.R.A., the National Rifle Association, should feel guilty about the Columbine massacres goes without saying. The idea that two high school kids were able to amass an arsenal that included an Intratec fingerprint-resistant, high-volume assault weapon; a Hi-Point 9-millimeter carbine; a sawed-off pump-action shotgun, and a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun should make anyone who opposes gun control ashamed.
4/22/1999	Portrait of Outcasts Seeking to Stand Out	Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, students at Columbine High School, worked last Friday making pizzas. On Monday, they went bowling. And on Tuesday, it seems, they committed mass murder. Nobody had taken the two youths seriously.
4/22/1999	America Online to Compete in Assigning Internet Domains	America Online, the world's largest on-line service, was one of five companies chosen today to compete with Network Solutions Inc., which currently enjoys a Government-backed monopoly in the lucrative business of assigning the Internet addresses known as domains. The surprising choice of America Online introduced a seemingly formidable competitor to the business of assigning Internet addresses -- and prompted questions about whether smaller companies would ever compete effectively.
4/18/1999	The Proletariat, on Line	To the Editor: An April 14 Business Day article on a labor complaint against America Online by a group of former volunteers made my jaw drop. These people volunteered to do work in exchange for free on-line service. For them now to complain that they were exploited defies all logic.
4/14/1999	America Online Is Facing Challenge Over Free Labor	For the last 10 years, America Online Inc., the nation's largest on-line service, has relied on volunteers to help maintain the virtual community it offers its members. The volunteers, who are known as ''community leaders,'' perform tasks like answering questions from subscribers, supervising chat rooms and enforcing the service's rules. The reward has been a free account with the service and, America Online says, the opportunity to play a more active role in its community of 16 million members.
4/3/1999	Man Is Charged In the Creation Of E-Mail Virus	After a global search for the author of the fastest-spreading computer virus in history, investigators in New Jersey arrested a 30-year-old software programmer on Thursday night and charged him with writing and sending out the now-famous Melissa virus. The programmer, David L. Smith, 30, was taken into custody after F.B.I. agents and officials from America Online helped investigators from the New Jersey Attorney General's office home in on the Internet access provider that was apparently first used to send the virus, which has now infected more than 100,000 computers worldwide.
3/5/1999	VERIO TO PAY AMERICA ONLINE FOR WEB SERVICES DEAL	The Internet-service provider Verio Inc. will pay America Online Inc. at least $42.5 million to become the on-line service company's exclusive operator of Web sites for businesses. America Online will also get a share of future revenue in the deal, which includes a Verio and America Online Web site that will offer Verio Web services and Internet commerce products, the companies said yesterday. Verio will receive on-line advertising and promotion of the venture. Verio shares rose $4, to $36.50, while America Online's fell 81.25 cents, to $86.25.
2/24/1999	Microsoft Official Concedes That He Erred in Testimony	The Government's lead lawyer accused a Microsoft executive of making up evidence at the antitrust trial today, and, after presenting the witness with his own E-mail contradicting his statements, forced him to correct his testimony. The courtroom incident focused on a matter of timing: when the executive, Daniel Rosen, had known that a software rival was making an Internet browser to run on the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system.
2/18/1999	Microsoft Trial Explores an Odd Alliance	A senior executive of the Microsoft Corporation reported in Federal court today that America Online had, at least for now, renewed its contract to equip its users with Microsoft's Internet browser -- even though it is buying Netscape Communications, Microsoft's main competitor in the browser field. The executive, Brad Chase, quickly added that he believed America Online would abandon Microsoft soon enough, dealing a serious blow to Microsoft's effort to make its browser, Internet Explorer, the industry standard.
2/5/1999	MCI Worldcom to Start Internet Service	MCI Worldcom Inc., the No. 2 United States long-distance company, confirmed yesterday that it would start a new Internet access service using information and content from America Online's Compuserve unit. The new service allows MCI Worldcom to re-enter the consumer Internet business that the MCI Communications Corporation exited last year. MCI sold its Internet operations to gain regulatory approval for its $40 billion acquisition by Worldcom Inc. last September.
2/4/1999	BANK ONE AND AMERICA ONLINE SIGN CREDIT CARD DEAL	America Online Inc., the No. 1 on-line service, signed a five-year agreement to market credit cards over the Internet with the Bank One Corporation's First U.S.A. unit, the largest provider of Mastercard and Visa cards in the United States. Through the agreement, First U.S.A. will pay American Online up to $500 million to be the provider of a co-branded card and be the exclusive marketer of credit card products and services on America Online, the Compuserve on-line service, AOL.com and AOL Instant Messenger in the United States and Canada. The two companies established a co-branded Visa card in 1996, and the new agreement extends that connection.
2/2/1999	America Online to Buy Moviefone for $388 Million in Stock	Mr. Moviefone is hooking up with the ''You've got mail'' man. America Online said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Moviefone Inc. for stock valued at $388 million, linking two companies notable for their sonorous spokesmen.
1/31/1999	Worries About Big Brother at America Online	Like the divided generations of Irish before them, the two opposing camps of contributors to America Online's discussion group on Ireland rarely agree on anything. But when the world's leading on-line service suspended their contentious electronic debate last month, participants on both sides were united in their dismay. ''Don't stop just to appease the AOL Thought Police,'' one proponent of a united Ireland wrote to the Unionist contingent. ''I'd much rather have someone vehemently disagree with me than know that anyone has been silenced!''
1/29/1999	Inflated Stocks Cushion Pitfalls Of Net Mergers	A handful of leading companies will come to dominate cyberspace. That snippet of rhetoric has become all the analytical underpinning there is to justify the unprecedented stock market values of the prominent Internet companies like Yahoo, America Online and Amazon.com. On the face of it, that well could be true. On the other hand, the Internet may make it easier for new competitors to constantly challenge the leaders.
1/28/1999	America Online's Profit Rises Significantly	America Online continued to show vigorous growth and improving profitability in the latest quarter, earning $122 million on sales of $960 million, the company said yesterday. That profit included $33 million in tax breaks carried forward from the company's earlier losses. Excluding those benefits, America Online would have earned $88 million, or 17 cents a diluted share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up 349 percent from $19.6 million, or 4 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. That exceeded the 14 cents a share that analysts have been forecasting. Revenue was up 62 percent from $592 million.
1/20/1999	Excite and At Home Confirm $6.7 Billion Merger	One company was started in the proverbial Silicon Valley garage. The other began as a play by some of the nation's biggest cable television interests. Yesterday, they joined forces in the race to capture Internet users and the dollars they are increasingly spending on line, and investors appeared to endorse the strategy. The deal brought together Excite Inc., which has evolved from a simple search engine into the Internet's sixth most heavily trafficked site, and the At Home Corporation, a high-speed Internet service aimed at cable television subscribers, in what the two companies described as a merger.
1/14/1999	Seeking Speed, America Online Joins Forces With Bell Atlantic	In a move to compete with high-speed cable-modem services, America Online and Bell Atlantic yesterday announced a joint marketing effort to sell high-speed Internet access to America Online's customers. The alliance marks a significant step in America Online's effort to retain its leadership as a ''portal,'' or entry point, to the Internet in a market increasingly moving toward high-speed Internet access. The cable-modem business currently has only about 500,000 customers nationwide but is expected to more than double this year.
1/7/1999	Irish Debate Forums Are Reined In by AOL	America Online has decided that subscribers who favor or oppose Irish nationalism can continue their heated disagreements in AOL's on-line forums, but they're going to have to be more cordial about it. On Dec. 11, AOL, the world's largest on-line provider, pulled the plug on 23 Irish Heritage discussion forums. AOL said it had done so because the political debates had included too many personal attacks and ''vulgarity and profanity,'' which violated AOL's terms of service. Last week, AOL reopened the discussion groups after ''cleaning them up,'' said a spokesman, Jim Whitney. In a note to visitors to the discussion groups, AOL stated, ''We encourage you to make this a more amiable place where any person, regardless of faction, can openly discuss political issues and current events.''
1/7/1999	Microsoft Presses Its View About Rivals' 3-Way Deal	In its antitrust trial today, the Microsoft Corporation made its most concerted effort yet to convince a Federal judge that the recently announced deal that brings together three of its rivals -- America Online Inc., the Netscape Communications Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc. -- seriously weakens the Government's case. In a three-way deal announced in late November, America Online agreed to buy Netscape for $4.2 billion and made a side agreement to buy and jointly develop technology with Sun. Last month, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the outcome of this nonjury trial, expressed the view that the deal ''might be a very significant change in the playing field as far as this industry is concerned.''
1/6/1999	AMERICA ONLINE ENLARGES ITS STAKE IN TEL-SAVE.COM	America Online Inc. has enlarged its share of ownership in Tel-Save.com Inc. to about 15 percent and said it had extended its marketing agreement with Tel-Save, a reseller of telephone services, by two years. America Online said it would make a $55 million investment in Tel-Save.com common stock at $19 a share and would exchange about $19 million in Tel-Save.com warrants for common stock. The investment will add to America Online's current holding of about 8 percent, according to Gabriel Battista, who became Tel-Save's president and chief executive yesterday. Since 1997, Tel-Save, which is based in New Hope, Pa., has sold phone services to the customers of America Online, which is based in Vienna, Va.
1/5/1999	On-Line Giant May Link To CBS News	CBS News will announce a deal with America Online Inc. later this week to become the exclusive broadcast news provider for the on-line service, executives involved in the agreement said yesterday. The deal lacks only some final details, the executives said. When completed, it will mean that CBS will replace ABC News as the provider of news in text, video and audio on America Online.
12/16/1998	Industry Plan Is Aimed at Selling Music Over the Internet	If all goes according to plan, music fans will be able to buy top hits for electronic delivery through the Internet by Christmas 1999. In a press conference yesterday at the Sony Building in midtown Manhattan (and cybercast through the Internet at www.riaa.com), leaders of the Recording Industry Association of America and chief executives of the five major recording companies said they would work with major technology companies to develop the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a standard for delivery of music over the Internet.
12/3/1998	An Alliance With Netscape Will Add to AOL's Web Power	The Microsoft Corporation as the Internet's monolith? Think again. A new analysis of America Online's plan to buy Netscape might spare Microsoft the on-line-monopoly moniker. If the buyout goes through, Web sites owned by AOL will become by far the most dominant gateways to cyberspace, according to the survey, by Cyber Dialogue, an Internet research firm based in New York.
12/2/1998	Competition on the Net	To the Editor: You argue (editorial, Nov. 25) that America Online and Netscape merged because Microsoft somehow forced Netscape into dissolution, yet you leave out the fact that Netscape sold for more than $4 billion because of the phenomenal growth that both companies see ahead. That's a mighty price and a rosy philosophy for an industry in which you doubt there is sufficient competition.
12/2/1998	Gates Case Made In E-Mail to Staff	In an E-mail to his executive staff today, William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, said that the Government's antitrust case was seriously undercut by America Online's planned $4.2 billion purchase of the Netscape Communications Corporation. The Government, he wrote, ''must be VERY dismayed at this merger,'' because it proved that Microsoft's move to give its browser away was not predatory pricing but a recognition of its ''competitive price, which is zero.''
11/30/1998	The power-drunk high-technology world seems to be trying to one-up itself in the cynicism department.	NO matter how cynical you become, it's never enough to keep up.'' That aphorism, a sage comment on the absurdities of 1980's culture, was written by Jane Wagner for the actress Lily Tomlin, in their 1985 Broadway hit, ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe.''
11/29/1998	Competition and the Internet	To the Editor: Is the announcement that Sun Microsystems and America Online have made an agreement to acquire Netscape Communications Corporation (front page, Nov. 25) a sign of an open and healthy software market? Only if you subscribe to the robber baron's theory of free trade: the fewer the competitors, the greater the competition.
11/29/1998	Competition and the Internet	To the Editor: Re ''Competition on the Internet'' (editorial, Nov. 25):
11/26/1998	AOL Offering Cash To Lure Chat Users	America Online made headlines this week for its deals with Netscape and Sun Microsystems for $4.2 billion. Now the on-line giant has made another deal, one that could net its new customers . . . 50 cents? In a program it will roll out in mid-December, AOL said it had authorized an on-line incentive company, Cybergold of Berkeley, Calif., to pay 50 cents to every person who downloads and installs AOL's chat software, called Instant Messenger.
11/26/1998	3-Way Alliance May Prove A Real Threat to Microsoft	Eight years ago Apple Computer and I.B.M. undertook a common software and computer chip development effort to challenge the Microsoft Corporation's dominance of personal computing and remake the computing industry at home and in the workplace. Three years later the alliance was in a shambles, shaken by internal turmoil and ignored by the market. Indeed, during the last decade the failure of large corporate technology alliances seems to be the rule rather than the exception.
11/25/1998	Competition on the Internet	America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields. But it does not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software. The department has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in other software realms. The Internet has risen so quickly as an information medium that only four years ago, in his book ''The Road Ahead,'' Bill Gates scarcely mentions it. In addition, only a couple of years ago America Online, the world's biggest on-line service, was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely derided as ''America On Hold.'' Now Microsoft has moved so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing it of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward to make deals with other Internet players.
11/24/1998	Culture Clash Seen in Merger Of Companies	When Marc Andreessen and his fellow whiz kids from the University of Illinois arrived in Silicon Valley in 1994 to found the Netscape Communications Corporation, the brash new darling of the digerati was the antithesis of America Online, widely perceived as a shelter for technical ''newbies'' unprepared for the brave new world of the Net. That the two are now on the brink of merging is a measure of how much the divide between Internet sophisticates and mere computer-using mortals has narrowed. Next month's scheduled release of the movie ''You've Got Mail,'' a romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks and America Online, serves as final proof, if any was needed, that cyberspace has gone mainstream.
11/24/1998	Microsoft Says Proposed Netscape Deal Supports Its Case	The Microsoft Corporation argued in Federal court today that the proposed acquisition of the Netscape Communications Corporation by America Online seriously undermined the Government's antitrust suit against the software giant. ''From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the Government,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, said this morning on the courthouse steps.
11/24/1998	Investor Response Shows Quirks of Internet Deals	Does the stock market know something the rest of us do not about the terms of America Online's proposed purchase of Netscape Communications? A few years ago, the kind of unusual trading in Netscape's stock that took place yesterday would have been seen as an indication that another buyer was going to emerge to bid up Netscape's price. But with all the irrationally exuberant trading in Internet companies, it was difficult to read such reasoning -- or any rationale at all -- into stock prices.
11/16/1998	America Online Has New Portal	When America Online bought the small Israeli start-up company Mirabilis last June for $287 million, people in the industry scratched their heads and wondered what the buyer was getting. Mirabilis makes a software program called ICQ for chat and instant messaging that has been distributed free to Internet users who give it a cultish dedication that one executive likened to fans' devotion to the Grateful Dead. Analysts wondered how America Online would recoup its investment in Mirabilis, which had yet to make a profit from its grass-roots chatters, without offending them. Many ICQ members wrote notes of protest on the company's Web site (www.icq.com) after the sale, expressing fears of commercialization.
11/16/1998	Where Does Microsoft Want You To Go Today?; The New Strategy: Keep Web Surfers Busy With a Series Of MSN Sites	Haven't we seen this screen before? The latest Internet initiative from the Microsoft Corporation is an all-in-one service that combines news, information, shopping, bulletin boards and electronic mail. Even its name sounds familiar: MSN.
10/30/1998	Not Showing This Week: Gates's Taped Testimony	Two blocks away, on Capitol Hill, it would have been called a filibuster. At the Federal courthouse, however, it was simply a defensive strategy. In pursuing a laborious cross-examination of the second witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial, lawyers for the company foiled plans by the Justice Department to close the week with the much-anticipated -- and in Microsoft's case, much-dreaded -- videotaped questioning of the company's chairman, William H. Gates.
10/30/1998	In Eighth Day, Microsoft Trial Slows Its Pace	In its eighth day, the Microsoft antitrust trial shifted into a slower gear as a senior executive of America Online was led through a painstaking cross-examination in which he was asked to define technical acronyms and parse the fine print of contract terms. By the end of the day, the Microsoft Corporation's defense team had made a few points and scored one clear victory -- it had dragged the cross-examination out so long that the Government did not have time to show videotaped testimony from the company's chairman William H. Gates. Though not scheduled to appear in person, Mr. Gates is the absent star. In the opening session last week, the Government used a few minutes of the lengthy taped deposition, showing an apparently uncomfortable Mr. Gates saying he was not involved in planning moves Microsoft made in the Internet software market that the Justice Department asserts were illegal.
10/29/1998	America Online Adds 40 Retailers	America Online, the world's largest on-line service, said yesterday that it had added 40 new retailing partners, including Toys ''R'' Us Inc., to the shopping section of its on-line services, bringing the total to 11O. America Online, with 13 million members, has said 95 percent of the retailers who have agreements to sell on its service renew those partnerships. It noted that most of the agreements with its retailing partners extend to its Web site, www.aol.com, and to its Compuserve on-line service.
10/29/1998	U.S. Describes Microsoft Fight To Secure Ally	Firsthand testimony from a senior executive at America Online and new documents introduced in court today provided an extraordinarily detailed portrait of the Microsoft Corporation's campaign to thwart a planned partnership between the nation's largest on-line service and the Netscape Communications Corporation, Microsoft's rival in the Internet software market. Microsoft's main weapon in the campaign, the Government contends in its antitrust suit, was offering America Online a prime place on the desktop of its industry-standard Windows operating system. That deal, the Justice Department contends, is an example of how Microsoft illegally used the market power derived from its monopoly in operating-system software to stifle competition in the market for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
10/1/1998	This Space Available on AOL Starting for a Mere $25,000	For the Web surfer who has everything, the new Neiman Marcus Christmas catalogue offers an exclusive spot on the menu of America Online. The price tag: just $25,000. Actually, that is the minimum bid in the auction for the spot, which AOL calls a ''keyword.'' Typically, these keywords are saved for general categories like Sports or News or are sometimes used to advertise on-line events for celebrities like the Spice Girls. The keyword up for auction will be the first assigned to a regular Joe or Jane, albeit one with some big green to toss around.
10/1/1998	Avoiding Log-Offs	To the Editor: Regarding Keith Johnson's letter (Sept. 24) about staying on line while using AOL: Go to www.jimjams .com, where you can download a product called Absolutely on Line (free trial) that will send a signal to your ISP that you are active. RICHARD GORDON New York, Sept. 25, 1998
9/29/1998	S.E.C. Crackdown on Technology Write-Offs	It is upgrade time at America Online. Never mind the noise about its new 4.0 browser software version. The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered the on-line service, and the rest of the technology industry, to improve the way they account for mergers and acquisitions. The issue is how technology companies have seized on a footnote in the accounting rules related to research expenses to write off most of the purchase price of companies as soon as they acquire them. This prevents a continuing drag on profits that would result from writing off the purchase price over several years.
9/24/1998	Downloading on AOL	To the Editor: Michelle Slatalla, the writer in ''A Second Look at AOL, the Refurbished Ellis Island of the Net'' (Sept. 17), was fortunate that her return to AOL was courtesy of her current Internet service provider. She mentions a long download, but at least with her I.S.P., it was uninterrupted. Any AOL download longer than 47 minutes is interrupted by a message that asks, ''Do you wish to stay on?''
9/21/1998	Studies Differ on Internet's Impact on TV	So, are eyes starting to wander? With tens of millions of people using the Internet every day, more and more advertisers and media executives are starting to wonder whether active surfers are watching less television.
9/17/1998	Happy Birthday, Your Team Won, Your Stock Crashed	WEEKDAY mornings for Jessica Nierenberg, a 23-year-old research manager at a market research company in San Francisco, usually begin with a dash to her neighborhood bus stop for a 30-minute ride to her office in the city's financial district downtown. By 8:30 she is at her desk, pouring herself a bowl of breakfast cereal and firing up her computer for a glimpse at what the planet has wrought while she slept. What greets her on her computer's screen is selected and displayed by My Yahoo, a free service by Yahoo, the giant Internet information company based in Santa Clara, Calif. My Yahoo shows Ms. Nierenberg how many E-mail messages she has waiting to be read and a sampling of news headlines -- she can decide to call up any of the articles on domestic, political and international news for a more detailed look. Weather forecasts for her area and for Boston, her hometown, are parked in a corner of the screen.
9/17/1998	A Second Look at AOL, the Refurbished Ellis Island of the Net	EVERY society has its own class system, and so it is with the Internet. So, of course, the people who were first on line -- the early settlers who can reminisce about the good old days of the Arpanet -- get the most points for snob appeal. They are the on-line equivalent of those who claim that their ancestors were on the Mayflower. It is this class system that explains the simmering resentment among early adopters toward America Online. That on-line service has long been a kind of wired Ellis Island, a gateway through which the great unwashed arrive on the Internet shore. I felt no gratitude to America Online for easing my own on-line arrival a few years ago because I, too, wanted desperately to be mistaken for the kind of blueblood who had been on line since the early days, a charter member of the Daughters of the Internet Revolution. It never occurred to me to applaud the service for creating a painless gateway with its easy installation and setup process and its See-Dick-Run interface.
9/16/1998	A former television executive enters a deal to provide content for Web-faring women.	IN a bow to advertisers marketing products to women, America Online said yesterday that it had agreed to sell three of its women-oriented services to a new venture formed by Geraldine B. Laybourne, the former head of cable television operations for the Walt Disney Company and ABC, who will develop them for the on-line service's new Women's Channel. Ms. Laybourne, long considered one of the most successful women in the television industry, left Disney/ ABC in May to form Oxygen Media, a company devoted to creating programs for women and children, both on line and on television. Before joining Disney/ABC, she built up Nickelodeon, the children's cable network.
9/14/1998	Media Talk; Internet Magazine Obtains Prime Spot at America Online	A deal by the Internet magazine Salon to become an ''anchor tenant'' on America Online highlights some noteworthy developments both at the on-line publication and on the World Wide Web. People close to the deal, announced last week, say it will cost Salon (www.salonmagazine.com) less than $500,000 a year. Andrew Ross, Salon's vice president, said Salon would pay America Online ''considerably less'' than some other anchor tenants -- who are guaranteed a prominent position on one or more of America Online's 19 primary channels -- though he declined to specify the size of the payment.
8/5/1998	America Online Grows Despite Increasing Fees	Showing that a 10 percent price increase hardly dented its rapid growth, America Online said its operating earnings totaled $57.3 million for the quarter that ended June 30, a tenfold increase over the same period a year earlier. That represents operating income of 23 cents a share, exceeding the 19 cents that analysts estimated. In a rare move, however, the company said it could not publish its net earnings pending an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over several special charges.
8/3/1998	Senate Panel Would Reduce Tax Moratorium on Internet	A proposed six-year moratorium on taxes in cyberspace would be reduced to only two years under the version of the Internet Tax Freedom Act approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The committee also voted last week to force states and local governments that tax Internet access to end these taxes, but left untouched claims for millions of dollars in taxes that America Online did not collect from customers and may now have to pay at its own expense.
7/22/1998	Secret to AOL Success: Sex, at Least in Part	AOL.COM How Steve Case Beat Bill Gates, Nailed the Netheads and Made Millions in the War for the Web By Kara Swisher Illustrated. 331 pages. Times Business. $25. In the brief, event-packed decade since its founding, America Online has become a company with that rarest and most valuable of assets, a name, like that of Coca-Cola or IBM, so widely known as to be synonymous with its business. It wasn't easy, as we discover in Kara Swisher's detailed, warts-and-all history of one of the great capitalist success stories of all time.
7/20/1998	Congress Is Challenging State Internet Fees	Taxes on Internet users' access to cyberspace may become a contentious political issue this fall in eight states. The trigger for controversy at the state level is Congressional legislation called the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which the House passed unanimously last month. The Senate, after a hearing last week by its Finance Committee, is expected to vote on the measure soon. The legislation would effectively ban taxes on Internet access, but it includes a grandfather clause that would allow eight states with existing taxes to continue to impose them.
7/13/1998	Compressed Data; Chat Software Company Joins America Online	Decisions of the digital age: What do you do when your small technology start-up is bought by America Online for $287 million? The founders of Mirabilis, based in Tel Aviv, know. They flew the entire staff to New York for a weekend-long celebration. So on Friday, 68 Israeli software developers filled the back of Lot 61, a nightclub on West 21st Street in Manhattan, doing in real time what users of their product do on line: chat.
6/30/1998	Teen-Ager Admits Using Virus To Steal Computer Passwords	A teen-age computer hacker pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court yesterday to stealing more than 500 passwords from America Online users last year. Prosecutors said that the teen-ager, referred to in court papers as John Doe, had obtained the passwords by sending E-mail messages to America Online subscribers from February through April.
6/29/1998	The battle for Internet supremacy is shifting to the companies that sell the connections to users.	WHEN America Online rebuffed AT&T's merger flirtations last month, it could hardly have known that the long-distance giant would soon marry what may be the on-line service's most potent long-term enemy: the At Home Corporation. At Home, in which AT&T will get a 42 percent interest as part of its $31.8 billion acquisition bid for Tele-Communications Inc. last week, markets a high-speed Internet service over cable television wires. It is hardly a force today, with only about 100,000 subscribers. America Online says it has 12 million customers, more than half of the homes in the United States that have on-line access.
6/19/1998	Disney Joins Rush to Build Web Gateways	The Walt Disney Company joined the nation's biggest media and technology companies yesterday with its own effort to control where people go in cyberspace. Disney announced a complex deal valued at about $900 million in which it will buy 43 percent of Infoseek, a service that helps guide users on the World Wide Web.
6/17/1998	Editors' Note	An article on Friday reported settlements by the Navy and America Online with a highly decorated sailor who was investigated by the Navy after he posted a computer message, under an anonymous E-mail address, in which he described himself as gay. America Online, which divulged the sailor's real name to the Navy, agreed to pay him damages for violating his privacy. Under the Navy's part of the agreement, the 36-year-old sailor will retire with full benefits and with tens of thousands of dollars to pay his legal fees. The first paragraph of the article described the settlements as a ''victory for gay rights.'' That phrase was supplied in editing. It failed to take the Navy's view into account. And it did not reflect any opinion expressed by the sailor, Master Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh, whose lawyer has commented only on the privacy aspects of the episode. The Navy, which withheld comment at the time, now says the settlement was in no way a victory for gay rights, since the service was achieving at least part of what it wanted: the departure of Mr. McVeigh, because of what appeared to be a declaration of homosexuality.
6/16/1998	Times Guide to Entertainment Opens on the Internet Today	Entering a market crowded with some of the biggest companies in cyberspace, The New York Times Company said yesterday that it would introduce an Internet service about entertainment, restaurants and shopping in New York City and its suburbs. The site, called New York Today, will be available, starting today, at www.nytoday.com. The service will compete with New York Sidewalk from Microsoft, Digital Cities New York from America Online and Citysearch New York from Citysearch, a privately held company. All the companies are seeking a share of the rich market for local advertising, which includes classified advertising, yellow pages listings, outdoor, broadcast and print ads.
5/21/1998	Kodak and AOL Plan To Offer Photos on Web	In a bold move designed to revive its digital photography operation, the Eastman Kodak Company announced this week that it had joined with America Online in a service to be introduced in the fall. Kodak will permit AOL's 12 million subscribers to drop off rolls of films at any of about 30,000 photo-processing shops in the United States. Once the film is developed, the images can be digitized and sent to their owners over the Internet as E-mail.
5/19/1998	KODAK AND AMERICA ONLINE TO OFFER PHOTOS VIA INTERNET	The Eastman Kodak Company is expected to announce today that it is joining with America Online to offer developed photographs via the Internet. Starting this fall, America Online subscribers who drop film off with participating retailers can, for the charge of from $5 to $7, have small versions of their pictures uploaded directly to America Online within 48 hours. The America Online subscriber can put the pictures in on-line photo albums, and can electronically order prints. America Online, Kodak and the retailers will split the profits from the extra fees and from reprint orders. The system uses technology created by Picturevision Inc.; Kodak owns 51 percent of Picturevision, and America Online plans to buy 10 percent of the remaining shares.
4/27/1998	The Hum of Search Engines Is Music to Netscape's Ears	The search is on for search engines. A number of companies -- including Netscape Communications and some big traditional media players -- are looking to build or buy their own Internet search services.
4/23/1998	America Online Libel Suit Dismissed	In a decision that was heartening for Internet access providers, a Federal judge today dismissed a libel suit brought against America Online by a high-ranking aide to President Clinton. But the judge let stand a similar suit against Matt Drudge, the cyberspace gossip commentator. The judge, Paul L. Friedman of Federal District Court here, said that he was reluctant to dismiss the suit brought by Sidney Blumenthal against America Online but that the clear intent of Congress -- to protect Internet service providers from liability for material disseminated by them but created by others -- left him no choice.
4/20/1998	America Online Alliance	America Online will announce an alliance today with thestreet.com, a financial news service on the World Wide Web. Under the arrangement, America Online subscribers will be given access to selected information from the Web site on a delayed basis, and offered a discount on its annual subscription fee. The alliance is the latest in a series of efforts to promote thestreet.com by James J. Cramer, a hedge fund manager who founded it with Martin Peretz, editor in chief of The New Republic, in late 1996.
4/9/1998	Tolls Are Increasing For Web On-Ramps	after several years of sharply declining prices, connecting to the Internet is getting more expensive again. Last week, America Online, the world's largest Internet service provider, raised its prices by 10 percent for its most active customers, those who formerly paid $19.95 for unlimited access to the Net. The new rate is $21.95 a month.
4/2/1998	Anger Over Bank Merger Spills Onto Web	The joke tellers said that UBS stood for ''Unemployed Before Summer'' and that Union Bank of Switzerland might as well be the Titanic. But the sarcasm about the proposed merger of the company and the Swiss Bank Corporation was not just limited to conversations in corporate hallways. A Web site critical of the proposed merger reflected the depths of Union Bank employees' resentment about the prospect of dismissals in one of the biggest banking mergers in history. But this time, unlike other mergers where emotions run high among employees, the authors vented their anger in public.
3/8/1998	The Newest Phone War	CONSUMERS looking for the cheapest long-distance telephone rates need only log onto the Internet, the newest arena of intense competition, where companies are offering special prices from 5 to 10 cents a minute. This week, the AT&T Corporation is expected to start offering its Internet customers long-distance calls at just 9 cents a minute, matching new rates introduced recently by MCI Communications.
2/26/1998	Bloomberg to Supply AOL With On-Line Business Data	Bloomberg L.P. will announce today that it has signed on as America Online's featured provider of business information, giving another vote of confidence to on-line consumer markets that have yet to show a profit. The position at America Online was vacated at year's end by Dow Jones after a contract dispute. In a sign of how on-line business strategies are changing, America Online paid Dow Jones for its business information; Bloomberg is reportedly paying America Online an undisclosed sum to be a featured part of the on-line service, which claims 11 million subscribers and is based in Dulles, Va.
2/10/1998	America Online to Raise Fee For Unlimited Use to $21.95	In a major defection from the standard monthly price of $19.95 for Internet access, America Online, whose 11 million members make up more than half the home Internet market in the United States, announced yesterday that it was increasing its charge for unlimited access to $21.95. America Online introduced its $19.95 flat-rate plan at the end of 1996. It announced its new pricing at the same time that it disclosed a broad management reorganization that elevated Robert W. Pittman, currently the president of America Online's network division, to the newly created position of president and chief operation officer of the entire company.
2/6/1998	A Reorganization Is Expected at America Online	Just a year and half after creating a division to nurture on-line programming, America Online is preparing to dismantle the unit in a management reorganization that would shift both the company's focus and executive power, people close to the company said yesterday. The reorganization, which is expected to be announced next week, would consolidate the power of Robert W. Pittman, who runs the company's other main division, AOL Networks, which operated the company's core on-line services. He would also oversee the development of new on-line content, an area that is now overseen by the president of the AOL Studios division, Ted Leonsis.
2/2/1998	Feeling Abandoned By America Online	In December, Hecklers Online, a publisher of humor and games, sent a holiday greeting card promoting the redesign of its site on America Online. The card's punch line: ''All you have to do is find it.'' This jab at the on-line service that gave Hecklers its start in the summer of 1995 was one of the milder manifestations of a growing frustration among America Online's small content partners. They were favored children in the company's early days, when keeping subscribers on line was the way to make money. But in the year-old era of flat pricing, advertising revenues are far more crucial to earnings than revenue from customers who linger on line.
2/1/1998	Finding a berth or joining a debate on line	On a chilly Sunday night in January, the Cruise Cafe -- the chat room of America Online's Cruise Critic site -- was buzzing, a silent babble of tales from distant lands. Debates raged: Dawn Princess or Majesty of the Seas? St. Croix or Tortola? Sea Bands or ginger capsules? Besides chat, Cruise Critic contains plenty of exhaustive and sometimes unflattering ship reviews by the site's editor, Anne Campbell, who not only has been on more than 60 sea voyages but also has twice sat through the movie ''Titanic.''
1/22/1998	On-Line Service Accuses Navy of Deception in Inquiry About Sailor	America Online today accused the Navy of deception after an internal investigation showed that the computer service company had violated its own rules and disclosed confidential information to the Navy that identified a 36-year-old sailor as homosexual. The sailor, Senior Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh, is facing dismissal from the Navy for homosexuality. He has sued the Pentagon to block the dismissal, charging that the Navy violated Federal privacy laws in obtaining information about him from America Online.
1/17/1998	Journal; The 2 Tim McVeighs	Here's a scenario that could be out of Kafka, or at least Alfred Hitchcock -- except that it's really happening and hasn't been sold to Hollywood. Yet. Its protagonist is Timothy McVeigh -- not that Timothy McVeigh, but a 36-year-old sailor who, through bad luck, not genealogy, found himself with the same name as the biggest mass murderer in American history. And that's the good news. Last fall, while on duty as the senior enlisted man on a nuclear submarine, he exchanged America Online E-mail with a civilian Navy employee with whom he was organizing a Christmas charity toy drive for kids back at his Honolulu base. His good deed did not go unpunished. His correspondent checked out his ''member profile'' -- the autobiographical sketch any AOL member can voluntarily post on line -- and discovered that Mr. McVeigh had listed his marital status as ''gay.'' She promptly notified the Navy that it just might have a declared homosexual in its midst.
1/17/1998	Navy Case Combines Gay Rights and On-Line Privacy	The first that Senior Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh knew of his troubles was when the U.S.S. Chicago, a nuclear-powered submarine on which he was a highly decorated crew chief, pulled into her home port in Honolulu last September. Mr. McVeigh, who is no relation to the man who was convicted last year of bombing the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, was ordered immediately into the offices of the squadron's legal officer.
12/15/1997	Updates: Media and Technology; New Outlet for Hamill	One more editor, into the breach. Pete Hamill, the former editor of The Daily News, will write a regular column for Digital City NY, an entertainment and city on-line guide that will start on America Online and the World Wide Web early next year. Mr. Hamill joins a list of contributors that includes the playwright Wendy Wasserstein and the monologuist Spalding Gray. America Online Studios, the content arm of America Online, said Mr. Hamill will write ''New York Chronicles'' monthly, with weekly updates.
12/1/1997	How to Get to Carnegie Hall? Cyberpractice	How did Christine Bernardo, whose only previous singing engagements were in church in Corona, Queens, find herself onstage at Carnegie Hall yesterday, belting out Handel's ''Messiah''? The answer has more to do with Ms. Bernardo's obsession with computers than her sturdy soprano. Whatever free time she does not spend singing, Ms. Bernardo, 48, spends poring over music-related sites on the Internet. So when America Online announced auditions last spring for the nation's first ''cyberchorus,'' with the promise of a performance at the nation's most prestigious concert hall, she hastily filled out the application on her computer screen and clicked on ''send.''
11/4/1997	Teacher's Aide Charged In Sex Abuse of Youth	A 30-year-old teacher's aide was arraigned in Suffolk County Criminal Court yesterday on a seven-count indictment charging him with sexually abusing a 14-year-old New Jersey boy he met on an America Online chat line. The suspect, Jonathan Panepinto of Brentwood, was charged with six counts of third-degree sodomy and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. The relationship was discovered after Mr. Panepinto and the 14-year-old boy were involved in a car accident on the Long Island Expressway on Oct. 14 in which the police said the boy was driving.
10/14/1997	America Online and Netscape Team Up on Message Service	America Online Inc. and the Netscape Communications Corporation plan to announce today an instant-messaging service in a deal that symbolizes the continuing integration of Internet with traditional on-line technology. Under the arrangement, Netscape, a leading Internet software maker, will adopt America Online's instant message feature for use over the Internet. On America Online, the world's largest on-line service, more than 130 million instant messages are sent every day.
10/9/1997	AMERICA ONLINE IN DEAL WITH TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDER	America Online Inc. agreed yesterday to make Preview Travel Inc. its main travel-service provider. Preview will pay America Online $32 million over five years and will provide services that include ticket sales, car rentals and hotel reservations. Users can also customize information and do research. America Online and Preview will share advertising and transaction revenue, though America Online did not disclose how it would be divided. Preview Travel, based in San Francisco, said yesterday that it planned to sell 2.5 million common shares in an initial public offering, raising as much as $24.7 million. America Online, based in Dulles, Va., is the company's largest shareholder and will retain a 11.9 percent stake after the offering. America Online shares rose $3.375, to $83.
10/6/1997	America Online Turns to TV as a Model	Starting next week, America Online will begin overhauling its service in an effort to attract another two million to three million subscribers during the next year. The ambitious growth plan is intended to strengthen America Online's role as the main gateway to cyberspace for the nation's households, enabling the company to charge more for advertising and on-line banners with links to other Web sites.
10/3/1997	Attacking and Defending The Internet, Yet Again	When the authorities said yesterday that the New Jersey teen-ager accused of sexually assaulting and strangling an 11-year-old neighbor was himself the victim of sexual assault by a man he met in an America Online chat room, people on both sides of the Internet debate had the same reaction: not again. Not again, said those who believe that a spate of highly publicized sexual abuse cases related to the on-line world underscores the need for tougher laws. ''This gives further support for the argument that the Internet should not be exempt from the laws that protect kids in every other medium,'' said Cathy Cleaver, director of legal policy at the Family Research Council.
9/19/1997	Music for America Online	America Online Inc. said today that it had entered into a three-year partnership with N2K Inc., a retailer of recorded music. The deal makes N2K's Music Boulevard the exclusive music retailer within America Online's Musicspace and music areas. America Online, an Internet on-line service, said it would receive a minimum of $18 million over the span of the agreement, with $12 million to be paid by Dec. 1. America Online said it planned to make a small investment in N2K's planned initial public offering of stock.
9/15/1997	The style of on-line services may come to matter more than their substance.	THERE was an uncanny thrill, about 15 years ago, when at a lumbering speed of 300 baud, characters seeped across the computer display announcing that I was connected to Compuserve. Of course, there were arcane commands to master to get anything accomplished and only cryptic and narrow columns of text to help novices; and every move from one region to another was sluggish and fraught with uncertainty. But none of that mattered: There was the novelty of typed conversation, the promise of advice from still innocent software developers and the sense that something unusual was being born.
9/13/1997	Child Pornography Charge	An executive of the Avon Products Corporation was charged yesterday with receiving and distributing child pornography over the Internet, officials said.
9/10/1997	What's Left for AOL?	America Online's acquisition of Compuserve's customer base is a smart strategic move because it allows America Online to expand its reach while eliminating its chief rival. But the deal, which also includes the sale of America Online's transmission network, doesn't address looming hurdles. The most serious of these may be potential competition from bare-bones E-mail and Internet service providers. Buying Compuserve's on-line service from the long-distance phone company Worldcom will raise America Online's subscriber base to 11.6 million from 9 million. Though America Online says it plans to keep the two services separate for now, the company clearly expects advertisers to notice its combined numbers. Its closest rival, the Microsoft Network, has 2.3 million subscribers.
9/9/1997	Latest Cyberdeal Seems to Have Room for Two Winners	Follow the money in yesterday's big Internet deal -- an intricate transaction involving Worldcom, Compuserve and America Online -- and it seems that the real value lies in the dull plumbing of cyberspace, not the glamour of new media. Worldcom Inc., the nation's fourth-largest long-distance phone company, agreed to pay about $1.2 billion in stock for the Compuserve Corporation. It will keep the under-the-hood side of Compuserve's business, managing data networks and providing data services for big corporate clients.
9/9/1997	America Online to Maintain 2 Services	As America Online proceeds to acquire Compuserve, its closest rival, company executives insist that things will not change much for Compuserve's 2.6 million subscribers -- for now. America Online said that it had no plans yet to merge Compuserve's base of subscribers with its own membership of more than nine million.
9/8/1997	Business is up, yet on-line services have image problems.	THE consumer marketers of cyberspace, led by America Online, have done an excellent job of attracting new customers, but they have an image problem, according to a new survey. The survey results, to be released today by Odyssey, a market research firm based in San Francisco, found that many of the nation's computer-equipped households continue to view commercial on-line services as often afflicted with network traffic jams, and slow and hard to use. In the six months from January to July, the percentage of people whose perception of an on-line service was excellent or very good had declined for all the big brand-name services -- America Online, the Microsoft Network, Compuserve, a separate company largely owned by H & R Block and about to be sold to Worldcom., and Prodigy, a unit of International Wireless.
9/8/1997	Worldcom To Acquire Compuserve	Worldcom Inc. will acquire the Compuserve Corporation for nearly $1.2 billion in stock, and then sell the struggling on-line company's subscription service to America Online in a complex three-way deal, according to executives close to two of the three companies involved. The three-company deal, approved last night by all parties, is expected to be announced as early as this morning.

7/25/1997	America Online Backs Off Plan To Give Out Phone Numbers	Responding yesterday to consumer outrage and mounting concerns about privacy in cyberspace, America Online, the largest on-line service provider, abandoned its plans to begin providing lists of its customers' telephone numbers to telemarketers and other direct-sales peddlers. The reversal came less than 24 hours after the plans became widely known through news accounts and on-line postings. America Online drew immediate fire from politicians and privacy-rights groups for the telemarketing venture, in part because the company for years had assured subscribers that it would not release their phone numbers and other personal information to outside parties.
7/14/1997	Chain E-Mail: Heart-Rending Pleas Are Sometimes Counterfeit	It seemed like such a heartfelt appeal: Jessica Mydek, only 7 years old and dying of cancer, sending out an electronic-mail message urging readers to live their lives more fully and, by the way, to pass her letter on to as many other E-mail recipients as possible, so that the American Cancer Society and ''several corporate sponsors'' would each contribute 3 cents toward cancer research for every message forwarded. Just to make sure that the cancer society gets the credit, the appeal said, copies of each forwarded appeal should also go ''to the American Cancer Society at acs@aol.com.''
7/7/1997	An On-Line Game Shift Stirs Protest	A group of subscribers to America Online has begun an on-line protest against the pricing practices and content changes of the service's lineup of games. The protest -- in the form of hundreds of electronic-mail messages to the company's chief executive, Steve Case -- were prompted by America Online's announcement that it would offer a premium-priced tier for its on-line games. In anticipation of the changes, which are to begin July 19, America Online, the nation's largest on-line consumer service, has dropped three popular role-playing games to make room for the new premium games. Company officials said that the games were removed because of ''outdated technology.''
4/29/1997	America Online and TBWA Part Ways	TBWA Chiat/Day in New York said yesterday that it had resigned as the lead agency for the creative portion of the America Online account, after almost two years. The decision came after America Online has fielded out several assignments to other agencies this year. Billings were estimated at more than $30 million.
4/8/1997	On-Line Stocks Fall as Reports of Deal Persist	The shares of America Online Inc. and Compuserve Inc. fell sharply in heavy trading yesterday as both companies declined to confirm reports that America Online, the country's largest on-line service provider, was negotiating to buy Compuserve, its biggest rival. Shares of America Online fell $4.125, to $44.25, on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Compuserve closed at $12, down $1.625, in Nasdaq trading.
4/4/1997	Now That You're on Line, Check for the Bottom Line	After months of frustrating busy signals, Susan Markicz, a photographer in the Bronx, thought she had solved her problems connecting to America Online in February when her teen-age son said that schoolmates had told him about a toll-free number that gave users quick access to the on-line service. Using the ''800'' number, she believed, would give her the best of all possible worlds: America Online service for a flat rate of $19.95 a month -- and freedom from busy signals. ''It was like hitting the lottery,'' she said.
4/2/1997	Merger Reports Lift Data-Service Shares	Shares of America Online Inc., the nation's largest on-line service provider, and of Compuserve, its biggest rival, rose sharply yesterday amid speculation that America Online was planning to acquire the smaller company. America Online shares rose $3.25, to $45.75. Compuserve stock, which opened the week at $9, rose $1.141 yesterday, to $11.
2/27/1997	Scanning the Web: When Home Sites Are Worth a Click	TAKE away the glossy paper and lavish images that have long been key components of home-design magazines, and you may well ask what is left. The high-tech, computer-screen world of on-line services would seem a distinctly inhospitable environment. But about a dozen shelter magazines are currently available on the World Wide Web or America Online.
2/11/1997	Use the Card Catalogue!	To the Editor: Robert Stein (Op-Ed, Feb. 6) says that what with all the information competing for attention on the Internet, regular surfers who find it hard to evaluate material that might be useful may be suffering from what Lewis Mumford called ''deprivation by surfeit.'' That's like saying there are too many books in the library. Use the (metaphorical) card catalogue, Mr. Stein! PETER STURKEN Santa Barbara, Calif., Feb. 6, 1997
2/10/1997	Data Service's Users Not Told Of Other Lines	While thousands of frustrated America Online subscribers tried in vain to dial into the service through its clogged electronic doorways during the last few weeks, the company made little or no effort to let people know that they could use older entryways where the crowds were smaller. Most customers would notice little difference between the older telephone lines connecting to America Online Inc., the country's No. 1 on-line service provider, and the newer ones whose use the service encourages.
2/6/1997	AOL's Bottom Line	Robert Stein Op-Ed article notes that America Online got into trouble after it offered unlimited service for one price to build its customer base and draw more advertisers, only to find that it could not accommodate all people who wanted to go on line; contends that America Online's troubles recall what happened to Look, Life and other major magazines in 1970's; maintains that these publications kept lowering subscription prices to keep circulation high in vain attempt to compete with TV for advertising; says that after spending millions to attract record numbers of readers, some magazines went under; drawing (M)
2/5/1997	Online Refund Should Require Just a Click	To the Editor: Your Jan. 31 Business Day article doesn't go far enough into the reasons why many America Online users are not pleased by the settlement in which the company agreed to pay millions of dollars to compensate subscribers for two months of network congestion. In order to claim America Online's refund, you must call an 800 number, send a fax or write a letter. When America Online offered the new flat monthly subscription rate to its users, all it took was a click on the mouse to switch billing plans.
2/1/1997	Getting Past the Busy Signal	The attorneys general of 36 states may be satisfied with the settlement they reached with America Online, but customers who have met with busy signals for weeks will be less convinced that the problem of network congestion has been solved. The on-line jam-up started in early December when America Online began offering a new pricing plan in which subscribers get unlimited use of the service for a flat $19.95 per month. Previously, the company charged customers a low monthly fee plus additional charges for each hour spent on line, a system that led customers to moderate their use of the service. The new policy created more demand for on-line time than the company had anticipated. The attorneys general contended that America Online had engaged in a deceptive business practice by advertising unlimited access and then failing to provide enough open lines to deliver it.
1/25/1997	New York Warning to America Online	Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco threatened today to sue America Online, the nation's largest on-line service, if the company did not relieve the congestion that has produced busy signals for members when they try to dial into the service. The on-line service has been inundated with complaints from customers around the country since America Online began offering computer users unlimited Internet access for $19.95 a month in December. America Online has acknowledged the problems and pledged to add capacity and provide better access in the near future. But last week, customers filed lawsuits in several states, including New York, accusing the company of selling a service that it could not provide.
1/17/1997	America Online Moves to Placate Its Angry Users	With its network and the patience of its customers strained to the breaking point, America Online announced a series of new initiatives yesterday to try to relieve the congestion that has led to at least four class-action lawsuits and thousands of complaints from frustrated consumers. The on-line service has been flooded with complaints from people around the country who have been unable to dial into the service since it began offering unlimited use for $19.95 a month in December.
12/22/1996	Traffic Backs Up on the Internet	It sounded highly reasonable: with Internet use taking off, America Online would simplify things. Instead of convoluted formulas for charging users depending on how long they stayed on line, it would charge a flat $19.95 monthly fee. Clean and simple. Little did it know, though, what demand lurked among the masses huddled over their glowing screens. When the new price went into effect on Dec.. 1, America Online members took to it like desert travelers to a pub ladling out free beer. Phone lines clogged, many angry users could not get on, busy signals abounded.
12/17/1996	An 'All You Can Eat' Price Is Clogging Internet Access	The most popular number for computer users in 1996 has become $19.95, which is emerging as the standard monthly price for unlimited access to the Internet. But this new ''all you can eat'' price is rapidly causing indigestion among network-access providers, phone companies and many customers. Freed from the constraints of hourly rates, millions of computer users are spending millions of hours every day connected to the Internet and on-line information services. That in turn is causing a surge in busy signals, a slowdown in service, and frustration in cyberspace.
12/5/1996	AXEL SPRINGER TO BUY STAKE IN AMERICA ONLINE UNIT	America Online Inc. said yesterday that the German newspaper publisher Axel Springer Verlag A.G. will acquire a 10 percent stake in AOL Germany for an undisclosed amount. AOL Germany is a unit of AOL Europe, a partnership between America Online and the German media company Bertelsmann A.G. In exchange for the stock, AOL Europe will gain access to some of the 40 newspapers and magazines that Springer publishes. Springer will also provide content and market support for the Internet service. America Online, based in Dulles, Va., said AOL Europe had more than 300,000 subscribers and would expand soon to Austria, Switzerland and Sweden. Shares of America Online rose $2.625, or 7 percent, to $40.125.
12/3/1996	New Flat Rate Creates Surge In Use of America Online	Computer users eager to take advantage of America Online Inc.'s new flat-rate pricing plan overwhelmed the system yesterday, causing widespread busy signals across the nation as subscribers tried in vain to dial into the on-line service's computers. America Online, the country's largest on-line service with 7 million subscribers, instituted the new plan on Sunday -- which includes use of proprietary information services and unlimited Internet access -- and immediately began experiencing a surge in usage, a company spokesman said.
10/21/1996	New modem plans by U.S. Robotics entice Wall Street.	THE Internet has the modem industry whistling. Millions of consumers are buying modems to connect their personal computers to the Internet and the World Wide Web, and to on-line information services like America Online and Compuserve. Millions more are expected to upgrade their older, slower modems to take advantage of new Internet multimedia applications, which include fancy animations, stereo sound, video clips and electronic mail with voice and video messages. As a result, modems have become a $3 billion industry, one that is growing this year an estimated 30 percent to 40 percent.
9/9/1996	Junk E-mail Costs Receivers Real Money	To the Editor: Your Sept. 5 Business Day article on America Online's blocking of unsolicited commercial messages aimed at users misses the major point that differentiates junk E-mail from conventional forms of advertising: conventional advertising is paid for by the advertiser, while junk E-mail is paid for by the recipient.
9/5/1996	America Online Blocks 'Junk' E-Mail Aimed At Users	Responding to a torrent of complaints from subscribers who say electronic junk mail is clogging their computer in-boxes, America Online took the unusual step yesterday of blocking all incoming messages from five Internet sites that it said were responsible for sending millions of unsolicited commercial messages over computer networks each week. David W. Phillips, associate general counsel for America Online, said the five Internet sites -- three of which are associated with a marketing company in Philadelphia called Cyber Promotions Inc. -- were responsible for sending as many as 700,000 unsolicited commercial messages each day to the private electronic mailboxes of more than a million America Online subscribers.
8/11/1996	The Fine Print in Cyberspace	THE Internet may be the forum of the future, but for millions of users it is no Hyde Park soapbox. Speech is regulated, not free, under the terms of contracts that people agree to when they gain access to the Internet through such services as American Online, AT&T Worldnet, Compuserve and the Microsoft Network.
8/11/1996	Red-Faced @America Online	America Online, the nation's largest on-line commercial computer network, went abruptly off-line last week, leaving its 6.2 million subscribers stranded in cyberspace for nearly 19 hours. The outage on Wednesday illustrated how much small businesses have come to depend on America Online for electronic mail and other services, without which many were closed for the day. It also pointed up the vulnerability of traditional on-line services to the ever-growing Internet, which never goes down.
8/8/1996	Data Network Fails, Vexing Small Business	In the most extensive network blackout yet in cyberspace, America Online, the nation's largest operator of an on-line computer network, was out of action yesterday, leaving its six million subscribers, including many small businesses and home-office workers, without electronic mail and other key communications services. The network outage, which occurred during the faulty installation of new system software beginning at 4 A.M., Eastern daylight time yesterday, also caused America Online's dozens of information publishers -- like the investment-advice service Motley Fool and the popular Health Respons Ability forum -- to lose many thousands of dollars in access fees or advertising revenues. And for the individuals and small-business users rendered digitally incommunicado yesterday, the blackout underscored how increasingly important E-mail has become to modern commerce.
8/4/1996	On-Line Doctor Helps Mothers	WHEN Dr. Lori Semel practices pediatrics, she doesn't always wear a stethoscope or consult in her D*O*C*S for Kids White Plains office. By night, Dr. Semel takes off for space. Cyberspace, that is. Since February, Dr. Semel, 36, has responded to more than 3,500 questions from parents around the world. A Mount Vernon resident, she is a pediatrician for America Online, a service she provides for free. Mothers ask her questions through ''Moms Online,'' a Monday night computer chat hour on America Online, a computer service that offers, among other things, Internet accessibility and electronic mail. On Mondays, from 10 to 11 P.M., mothers ask Dr. Semel questions.
7/19/1996	A Site for Computer Users	Starting tonight, additional Olympic coverage is available to computer users from The Times's two services -- The New York Times on the Web, at http://www.nytimes.com, and @times on America Online, including these highlights: *Results, color photos and audio, updated during the day.

Lawyers for America Online and the Morris Township School District will argue the question today in Superior Court. Dwight Pfennig, the Morris Schools Superintendent, says he received a message last month in the midst of contract negotiations with the teachers' union warning that he was in """"big trouble"""" for """"playing both sides of the fence."
7/6/1996	Suits Accord By America Online Set	America Online Inc. will give away millions of hours of on-line time to some subscribers to settle a series of lawsuits, lawyers involved in the litigation said yesterday. The agreement is intended to settle 11 class-action suits against America Online on allegations of improper billing practices.

6/26/1996	Market Place;The Growth, and Pain, of America Online	America Online, one of the big success stories in cyberspace, has certainly suffered some embarrassing setbacks lately. But are these growing pains or signs of a troubled company? Since early in May, the stock price of the on-line service has fallen nearly 40 percent. Insiders have been selling shares at a brisk pace. The Federal Trade Commission and several state attorneys general are investigating accusations that America Online Inc. is overcharging customers.
6/24/1996	When On-Line Service Cannot Be Counted On	Blame sunspots or planetary alignment, computer gremlins or human error. More than a million computer network users suffered interrupted or erratic Internet and on-line service connections last week because of a variety of planned and unplanned service shutdowns. Because of a single bad line in a computer program, Netcom On-Line Communications Inc. had to shut down its entire national system for 12 hours on Wednesday, affecting more than 400,000 Internet users, most of them businesses.
5/9/1996	America Online Profits Up But Stock Falls 10 Percent	America Online Inc. announced yesterday a continued surge in revenues, a rise in membership to nearly six million subscribers, and a new partnership to expand the on-line service into Japan. But even though America Online's third-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street's expectations, investors drove down the company's stock by 10 percent in what analysts said was a combination of profit taking and concerns over a new pricing plan for the service's heaviest users.
3/12/1996	As eWorld Sinks, Which Lifeboat?	APPLE COMPUTER INC.'s on-line information service, eWorld, is eVaporating, and by the end of the month will be eXtinct. Apple says it will shut down eWorld on March 31 and refocus its attention on the Internet's World Wide Web. Even so, Apple does not want to be known as the company that created 147,000 homeless people in cyberspace. It is encouraging eWorld refugees to migrate to America Online; AOL software will be bundled with most new Macintosh computers, and AOL will develop new software and services especially for Mac users.
2/12/1996	Market Place;As America Online's share price has soared, so has the growing number of short-sellers.	LAST Thursday, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation cut back its on-line service sharply, conceding that the future of electronic publishing is on the Internet. And the News Corporation is just the latest of several big companies to have reached that conclusion -- the most notable being Microsoft, which scrapped its plans for an on-line service and put Microsoft Network mainly on the Internet's World Wide Web. Yet there was another development in the business of cyberspace last Thursday. The share price of the king of conventional on-line services, America Online, quietly rose to another record, at $51 a share, up from less than $16 a share a year ago.
2/4/1996	On Internet, Memories Of Herricks	"GRADUATES of Herricks High School don't have to wait 5 or 10 years between reunions, and they don't have to leave their homes as far away as California and Arizona to get there. They've been meeting Sunday nights at 7:30 in a chat room  (keyword: Herricks) on America Online. Each week they reminisce about """"the Hill,"""" a steep, wooded slope on school grounds that was a favorite hangout for cutting class or smoking cigarettes. They revisit streets and subdivisions from the school district, whose peculiar geography drew its student body from a half-dozen or so sometimes overlapping suburban locales: Manhasset Hills and Roslyn and Roslyn Heights and Williston Park and Albertson and Searingtown and New Hyde Park."
1/14/1996	WHO NEEDS AMERICA ONLINE?	"The short answer to the question """"Who Needs America Online?"""" (by Jesse Kornbluth, Dec. 24) is no one. No one needs AOL (or Compuserve or MSN) because no one really needs the services they peddle: the """"chat"""" groups that have taken over where the CB radio fad of the 1970's left off; the superficial """"news""""; the games that no kid with a Nintendo will bother with once the novelty wears off."
1/14/1996	WHO NEEDS AMERICA ONLINE?	"Does Ted Leonsis truly believe that """"when you go to a cocktail party and America Online diskettes are being used as coasters, you know you've become mainstream""""? I get about four mailings a year, with one or two diskettes, from America Online, likewise from Compuserve and Prodigy. Sometimes the diskettes are inserted into magazines. I don't even know which recycling bin to use to discard this item of junk mail. It seems to me that the party givers are being more innovative than just going """"mainstream."""" Leonsis should take a lesson. HERBERT WEISS Middleville, N.J."
12/24/1995	WHO NEEDS AMERICA ONLINE?	"Ah, doughnuts, breakfast of champions!"""" Ted Leonsis exclaimed as he entered a conference room one morning in March and spotted a tray of standard-issue pastries. Leonsis is not a small man, so his quip drew a laugh. It also reassured his associates, who remembered how little pleasure Leonsis had found in his last meeting in this room. A month earlier, two Californians traveled to America Online headquarters in Vienna, Va., to present a proposal for an on-line site dedicated to surfing, the real kind, done in water. Assuming that the members of America Online's staff would be corporate types, the two Californians, Mark"
12/7/1995	On-Line Joint Venture Draws European Inquiry	The European Commission opened an inquiry yesterday into whether the plans of a joint venture by America Online Inc., the German media company Bertelsmann A.G. and Deutsche Telekom to create an on-line service would be anti-competitive. In a statement, the commission said it was concerned about possible anti-competitive situations that could slow the development of other on-line services. (AP)
11/25/1995	On-Line Stars Hear Siren Call Of Free Agency	Just as the old Hollywood studios lost their iron grip on the stars they nurtured, the traditional on-line studios like America Online and Compuserve are starting to lose their singular hold on the stars of cyberspace. These stars of today are the popular special-interest sites on the on-line services, typically started by young entrepreneurs in the last couple of years. The hot sites are crucial assets to the big on-line networks, keeping keyboard-tapping customers on the line, running up metered time and revenues.
11/16/1995	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;On-line services are venturing into unexplored territory as they try to establish their brand names.	"LIKE branding a steer, a branding campaign in advertising seeks to separate the advertised product or service from the herd. But are America Online's new television commercials outstanding or simply egregious? Consider this ad: As the spooky and majestic theme music from the film """"2001: A Space Odyssey"""" grows louder in the background, a monkey's paw is seen pushing a computer mouse. The paw double-clicks on icons and the computer screen sputters and shifts. Does this mean the killer ape from """"2001"""" has traded in his bone for a killer application?"
9/27/1995	Who Uses Internet? 5.8 Million Are Said to Be Linked in U.S.	Measuring the Internet population is a daunting challenge given the amorphous nature of cyberspace, with its lack of borders and its culture of anonymity. The latest attempt comes from O'Reilly & Associates, a publisher of computer books and Internet software, in a report to be published today. And the results look conservative: 5.8 million American adults are connected directly to the Internet. Another 3.9 million American adults use only commercial on-line services, like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy.
9/17/1995	SEPT. 10-16: Preying in Cyberspace; Child Pornographers Raided On Computer Network	"Federal authorities have invaded cyberspace to investigate child pornography and molestation. With more than a dozen arrests and searches of 125 homes and offices around the country last week, the F.B.I. capped a two-year, undercover investigation into the use of America Online, the nation's largest commercial computer network, to trade images of children and lure minors into sex. Agents assigned to the inquiry posed as underage computer users with names like """"One4fun4yu."""" They agreed to meet adults who were then arrested after arranging sexual encounters through chat lines."
9/15/1995	Company Says Electronic Mail Was Opened to Find Pornography	Responding to court orders related to a nationwide crackdown on the electronic transmission of child pornography, the America Online information service gave law enforcement agents access to the private electronic mailboxes of an unknown number of its subscribers, company officials confirmed yesterday. By reading and tracing electronic mail messages as they coursed through the America Online system, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were able to identify several thousand users of the service who viewed digitized images of children in sexual poses.
9/14/1995	Electronic Meeting Places Include Some Dark Alleys	If America Online took physical form as a city, it would be one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, with 3.5 million residents. Like any big city, America Online has scores of public parks and theaters, thousands of bars and cafes, and -- as the Justice Department crackdown on child pornography made clear yesterday -- some dark alleys and back rooms where a few unsavory characters conduct illicit business.
9/14/1995	Use of Computer Network For Child Sex Sets Off Raids	The Justice Department today announced a dozen arrests in a two-year investigation into the use of America Online, the country's largest computer network, to distribute child pornography and to lure minors into sex. The searches of 125 homes and offices around the country represented the largest investigation by Federal agents into the misuse of a nationwide computer network, in which information is exchanged between computers.
8/21/1995	Planet Out: 'Gay Global Village' of Cyberspace	"Planet Out, a new electronic media company that will make its debut on the Microsoft Network later this week, is seeking to become the """"gay global village"""" of cyberspace. If it is successful -- and some of the most influential names in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, the on-line networks and the gay communities are offering their support to make sure it is -- Planet Out may also become a model for the type of highly focused marketing that other businesses, like magazine publishing, have found more and more successful. But in cyberspace, there are no printing costs and deadlines are measured in minutes. Words and images can be delivered faster and in greater quantities."
8/14/1995	Steve Case At a Crossroad	Steve Case knows from painful experience how quickly technology markets can shift, destroying a once-promising business. In 1983, Mr. Case left a good marketing job at Pepsico Inc. to try to cash in on the latest trend in consumer technology, the Atari video game. So he joined a fledgling company that was starting an on-line service for users of the popular Atari computer-game machines.
7/10/1995	They Let Their Fingers Do the Talking	Little more than a year ago, Michael Bolanos, an independent concert producer, decided to get into the computer on-line business in a modest way. On Compuserve, a major on-line service whose subscribers can dial in for access to everything from out-of-town newspapers to stock quotations to conversation, he started an entertainment forum. It would be a little alcove in cyberspace, where, he figured, people could meet to discuss movies and television shows. Mr. Bolanos began his venture with a friend, one personal computer, scant hope of riches and no intention of abandoning his work as a producer.
5/17/1995	Microsoft and NBC in Multimedia Alliance	The Microsoft Corporation and NBC announced an alliance yesterday to produce an array of multimedia products and services. But the details were so fuzzy that some industry analysts said the announcement was the digital-age equivalent of agreeing to be friends. William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and Robert C. Wright, the president of NBC, said in a conference call with reporters that the companies would jointly develop CD-ROM's, interactive television services and products for Microsoft's new on-line service, the Microsoft Network.
5/11/1995	Prodigy Seen Opening Doors in Cyberspace	"Prodigy Services Inc. is expected to announce today a new feature that will allow hundreds of thousands of its users to create their own personal """"home pages"""" on the Internet's World Wide Web. Analysts said the advance would extend Prodigy's Internet advantage over its larger rivals, Compuserve and America Online, which are just beginning to allow their customers to view other people's home pages on the World Wide Web."
4/8/1995	Times Ads Available Over America Online	Beginning today, the three largest Sunday classified advertising sections of The New York Times will be available through the week to subscribers of the America Online computer service. The new service is accessible from the main screen of @times, The Times's on-line service, and includes the help wanted, real estate and automotive advertisements from tomorrow's newspaper. Several newspapers, including The Chicago Tribune and The San Jose Mercury News in California, already offer classified advertising on line.
4/2/1995	A Way to Join the Conversation With a Keyboard, Fax or Pencil	BEGINNING this week, readers of New Jersey can meet via computer in the @times area of America Online to discuss issues large and small facing New Jersey and its people. This is the place to argue about politics, complain about taxes and traffic, and share advice on everything from shopping to schools. Because readers can talk to one another, there will be plenty of lively conversation. Each Sunday, The Times's New Jersey section will print excerpts from responses to one question, and pose a new one.
3/21/1995	New Wrinkles at the On-Line Big 3	PERSONAL computer users who have hesitated to go onto the Internet will soon have the Internet coming to them. Each of the major consumer on-line information services, including America Online, Prodigy and Compuserve, is racing to meld its system with the global Internet. The Big Three services will soon be joined by the Microsoft Network and AT&T's Interchange, two new and powerful rivals with Internet aspirations. At the same time, some of the leading Internet access companies, including Netcom Inc. and Performance Systems International, are creating consumer versions of their business-oriented Internet services.
2/26/1995	February 19-25; A Child's Internet Sins Visited on the Parent	"AMERICA ONLINE said on Tuesday that it had grown to 2 million customers, but it was really only 1,999,999. I know because I was no longer one of them. """"Your account is inactive,"""" said the notice on the screen one Sunday morning this month in crisp, full-color letters. It gave an 800 number to call."
2/22/1995	Security Is Lost in Cyberspace	The arrest last week of the fugitive computer programmer Kevin D. Mitnick ended one man's spree of breaking into computer and telephone networks to steal information and services, Federal investigators say. But Mr. Mitnick was, despite his considerable technical skills, just one of thousands of shadowy figures who have been traversing public and private computer networks with relative impunity. Since Mr. Mitnick was jailed a week ago in North Carolina, there have been nearly 30 Internet break-ins serious enough to have been reported to the Computer Emergency Response Team, a government-financed security organization. The team declines to release any details for fear of further damaging the privacy and security of the corporations, universities and government agencies whose computers were attacked.
2/2/1995	Cyber-critics flock on line for a spirited post-mortem on the lineup of Super Bowl commercials.	"THE commercials that ran during Super Bowl XXIX have been critiqued by everyone from advertising experts to agency executives to David Letterman, who spoofed them with a mock """"Late Show"""" spot in which he stuffed his mouth with Doritos and proclaimed: """"Chips! It's what's for dinner!"""" Now the evaluation of Super Bowl ads has even entered cyberspace."
1/31/1995	Prodigy Sees Quick Growth From Internet Web Service	The Prodigy Services Company, struggling to regain ground it has lost in the consumer on-line information industry, said yesterday that the addition of a new Internet feature had led to phenomenal growth in the last two weeks. The company said that more than 100,000 Prodigy customers, many of them new subscribers, signed up for special software that lets them connect to the Internet's World Wide Web since the company began offering it on Jan. 17, and that the sign-up rate was continuing at 12,000 a day. Prodigy has an estimated 1.2 million users.
1/5/1995	Software Companies Upset By Demands for Royalties	Companies that make graphics software for viewing pictures on computer screens are in an uproar over what they say is a sudden and surprising demand that they begin paying royalties on a technology already used by millions of people. Demanding those royalties is the Compuserve Information Service, one of the leading on-line networks for personal computer users. Compuserve caught many graphics software developers off guard by posting a notice electronically on Dec. 29 that the companies had until Jan. 10 to pay Compuserve a royalty on any programs they sell that enable Compuserve subscribers to view thousands of images available over the network.
11/15/1994	A Cyberspace Atlas: America Online	"AMERICA ONLINE, the second stop on our virtual tour of cyberspace, is the most ambitious and aggressive of the popular online information services. It is impressive and infuriating in nearly equal measures. Point: America Online Inc. of Vienna, Va., has been advertising itself for some time as """"America's most popular Internet service provider,"""" when technically it had about as much to do with providing Internet services as does my Aunt Tootie."
11/9/1994	Microsoft and Visa in Software Deal	Staking another claim in the emerging market for electronic commerce, the Microsoft Corporation said today that it had entered an agreement with Visa International to provide technology for secure electronic bank-card transactions across public and private computer networks. The deal comes less than a month after Microsoft agreed to acquire Intuit Inc., the leading producer of personal finance software, in a stock swap valued at about $1.5 billion.
9/8/1994	The Pop Life	MTV Awards The MTV Video Music Awards, which are to be held at Radio City Music Hall tonight and broadcast live on MTV, have become one of the most eagerly anticipated music awards shows on television. With the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Aerosmith and Snoop Doggy Dogg to perform, and Roseanne the host, the 11th annual ceremony has a lineup that should help it win not only high ratings and sponsors galore but also status as a legitimate awards show. But is the award itself important?
8/31/1994	BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: Reporter's Notebook; On-Line Ads to Tempt the Hungry Computer Nerd	"McDonald's advertisements began appearing on the America Online consumer information network earlier this month. While McDonald's is the epitome of fast food, its ads on line take a long time to digest. On-line advertising has been risky for companies hoping to reach new markets through computer networks. McDonald's recognized that even computer geeks have to eat, however, so it created a """"McDonald's Interactive"""" area on the country's fastest-growing consumer network."
8/9/1994	Wiretap Access Bill Is Ready	Telephone and cable television companies would have to modify their networks to make it easier for law-enforcement agencies to conduct wiretaps and trace messages, under legislation expected to be introduced in the House and Senate on Tuesday. The bill, long sought by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and backed by the Clinton Administration, promises $500 million in Federal money to help communications companies pay for the development and installation of the necessary software.
6/10/1994	Times Begins On-Line News	"The New York Times Company and America Online started a service yesterday to give computer users access to an electronic data base of articles and information from The New York Times.

They are betting that the Vienna, Va., company will be a big winner in the business of computer services sent to homes -- the first huge consumer market, analysts say, in the evolution of computer and communications technology known as the information highway. """"You don't buy America Online for earnings,"""" said Steven Eskenazi, a principal of Alex. Brown & Sons Inc."
2/2/1994	Even in Cyberspace, Overcrowding	For a world that is theoretically infinite and without boundaries, cyberspace appears to be straining at the seams. In the computer-age equivalent of the Gold Rush, thousands of people are signing up each month for access to the worldwide web of computer networks and electronic information services -- known as cyberspace -- where strangers can chat, mail can be exchanged, groceries can be ordered and home banking can be done to name only a few possibilities.
1/29/1994	AMERICA ONLINE STOCK ADVANCES BY 14%	America Online Inc. shares rose $7.50, or 14 percent, yesterday after the company told Wall Street analysts that computer users were subscribing to the online service faster than was anticipated.

Ticketmaster sells more than 52 million tickets a year and has annual sales of more than $1.3 billion. The company, based in Los Angeles, is owned largely by the Pritzker family of Chicago, which owns the Hyatt hotel chain.
10/19/1993	Conversing On Line With Older Americans	"'TELL them that we lived through four wars,"""" an older woman said recently about how she arrived at her obsession (she prefers to say she is """"possessed"""") with that """"soul snatcher,"""" the personal computer. """"We have gone from sitting by the radio for fireside chats to seeing a war start while watching CNN one evening, from hearing about the invasion of Poland a day later on the radio to watching the butchery in the former Yugoslavia nightly, from the agony of plucking and cleaning chickens to the joy of buying them bare-bottom clean; my father once remarked to me how he had lived in the horse-and-buggy era and lived to see them put a man on the moon, and he was in awe of the fact. The point is, we cannot stagnate."
5/22/1993	CO-FOUNDER OF MICROSOFT SELLS HUGE STAKE	Paul Allen, a co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, who said in earlier Securities and Exchange Commission filings that he might seek to buy America Online Inc., has filed to sell 1.3 million Microsoft shares since May 3, according to S.E.C. filings. Based on a Microsoft share price of about $86 during the period of filings, the transaction would be valued at about $112 million, more than enough to purchase up to 50.1 percent of America Online shares. America Online gained $4.50 yesterday , or 15.1 percent, to $34.25, in Nasdaq trading. William Savoy, president of Vulcan Northwest and a colleague of Mr. Allen, said that Mr. Allen regularly sold Microsoft shares at the end of each quarter.
