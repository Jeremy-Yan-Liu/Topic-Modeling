10/23/2011	A Century of Chevy, From Cheap Date to America's Sweetheart	CHEVROLET, which celebrates its 100th birthday next month, has woven itself deeply into the fabric of America. Its Impalas dropped us off at school. Its pickup trucks hauled our produce on the farm. Its Corvette sustained our sports car fantasies through the boredom of high school algebra class. Earlier than almost any other automotive brand, Chevy created a palette of vehicles that ranged from the small and thrifty to the sleek and sporty to the large and smartly trimmed. Once the model line expanded beyond the limited body selections of its first half-century, there was a Chevy for almost everyone. The brand's broad appeal resulted in a place atop the sales charts starting in the 1930s and continuing nearly uncontested for decades. By the mid-1960s Chevrolet sold nearly threemillion cars and light-duty trucks a year.But there's more to the story than commercial success. Although it occupied the first rung of Alfred P. Sloan's General Motors hierarchy, a ladder on which customers would move up to more expensive brands as they gained affluence, Chevy developed a following of fans whose devotion lasted a lifetime. After decades of decline, Chevrolet has lately had a resurgence with its Cruze and Malibu sedans, the reinvented Camaro and the Volt, the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid. The full Chevrolet story has filled volumes. Here are some ofthe highlights of the 100-year journey.

Apparently, the entire automobile landscape has been impacted. Sales are down across the board. Several years ago, they were talking about 16 million cars sold a year. Now they are down 20 percent from what they predicted.

She said the company had also made the decision because G.M. would not have a major vehicle introduction to promote at that time.
9/21/2008	Comments of the Week	The Prius is the best-selling hybrid in the world because it not only has an alternative powertrain, but it has an alternative look. Most other hybrids look like any other car. Even if G.M. couldn't exactly carry over the styling of the show car, they should have made the actual design more exotic, because the people that buy them are not interested in making a subtle statement. They'll want everyone to know how green they are.

Tones Down the Volt	RICK WAGONER, chairman of General Motors, unwrapped the production version of the series hybrid Chevrolet Volt as part of the company's 100th anniversary celebration on Tuesday.

Lutz, onto ''The Colbert Report'' on Comedy Central, where Mr. Lutz found himself uncomfortably discussing his skepticism about global warming and conceding that the Volt is perhaps not the peppiest of cars.

Some people are selling a Hummer. And to get a sense of how bad it is when you're selling a big S.U.V. in the era of high gas prices, I went on Craigslist and surveyed the plaintive listings. The bottom line seems to be that if you have a Hummer H2 or even a more fuel-efficient H3 for sale, you're very negotiable. Let's talk, the ads say, but sometimes even that isn't possible.

7/20/2008	Comments of the Week	Has anyone seen a credible explanation for a near doubling in price? Given the request for a tax benefit, there should be some kind of third-party assessment of the economics here.

7/20/2008	What Is One Volt Worth?	LET'S say that in 2010 you have $40,000 to spend on a new hybrid car. Would you rather buy a Chevrolet Volt or, for about the same money, two Toyota Priuses?

7/19/2008	A Bipartisan Boost for G.M.	General Motors is the ''official car provider'' for the Republican and Democratic conventions.

11/19/2006	Mileage in the Real World: The Devil Is in the Details	"What is the real fuel economy of a given vehicle? Hybrid or not, it depends entirely on how you drive. Do you race away from stoplights or take it nice and easy? Is the air-conditioner running? Are the tires properly inflated? What's the outside temperature? If you try to coax the best mileage from your car, you will get much different results than if your right foot has turned to lead. Here are some notes from a journal I kept while test-driving the Saturn Vue Green Line and the Mercury Mariner Hybrid. BRADLEY BERMAN SATURN VUE GREEN LINE My first two days with the Green Line are spent running local errands around my home in Berkeley, Calif. On most trips, by the time the engine is warmed up I'm already back home -- not an ideal way to test mileage. The auto-stop function works great -- it shuts the engine off when the Vue is stationary -- but the ride feels heavy. The transmission """"grabs"""" too quickly, not letting me coast for as long as I would like. 71 miles, 21 m.p.g. On a family kayaking trip to Tomales Bay, the highway drive provdes an opportunity for good mileage. On our return, Lucas Valley Road (where scenes from ''Star Wars'' were filmed ) is an enjoyable ride -- but the winding roads bring the mileage down. 94 miles, 27 m.p.g. I spend the next day and a half running errands and shuttling the kids -- and making an attempt to get the worst possible mileage. I speed up before braking at red lights and stomp on the accelerator when the light turns green. 34 miles, 18.5 m.p.g. I try to see if I can beat the E.P.A. highway estimate of 32 m.p.g. Trying to avoid any trace of traffic, I go for a late-night spin. I keep a steady pace between 55 and 60 m.p.h., accelerating very slowly. I stay in the far right lane. The auto-stop feature doesn't help me at these speeds, but my light foot and good aerodynamics pay off in impressive mileage for a sport utility. 78 miles, 35.6 m.p.g. On my final trip, I take a double shot of espresso and let the Vue loose on the exact same route. The Green Line has decent but not impressive acceleration. When I go full throttle to gain speed, maintain a pace of 75 to 80 m.p.h., use the air-conditioning and brake quickly to stop, the mileage drops by 30 percent. 78 miles, 23.7 m.p.g. TOTAL: 355 miles; 25 average m.p.g. MERCURY MARINER HYBRID I am mesmerized by the eerily silent all-electric drive, and by the in-dash monitor that shows the flow of energy to, from and among the engine, electric motor, batteries and wheels. Despite less than ideal city conditions -- frequent stops and short trips -- I do my best to keep the Mariner in ''E.V.'' (all electric) mode. 67 miles, 35.4 m.p.g. My family takes a weekend hiking trip on Mount Diablo. I want to give the Mariner its first try on the highway, but we are stuck in traffic for most of the trip. In a full hybrid, that's not all bad. I remind myself that the Mariner gets better mileage in the city than on the highway and manage to stay above 30 m.p.g. for the trip. 62 miles, 30.7 m.p.g. Again, I put on my white hat and use every trick to get the best mileage: I never exceed the speed limit, don't accelerate rapidly or use the air-conditioner and coast whenever possible. I even manage to draft behind an 18-wheeler, letting it block the wind. The effort pays off. 78 miles, 37.5 m.p.g. I combine fast highway driving and multiple, aggressive city trips without allowing time for a proper warm-up. The full E.V. mode doesn't engage until the vehicle has warmed up. It's the worst possible condition. 34 miles, 23.6 m.p.g. On a city trip, I do my best to drive like an idiot. I race up to stoplights, weave in and out of traffic and exceed the speed limit. Still the mileage doesn't drop below 26. 37 miles, 26.1 m.p.g. On my final nighttime loop, I do my Jeff Gordon imitation: 75-85 m.p.h. all the way, with the air-conditioner running. The only vehicles that pass me are even bigger S.U.V.'s. I knock the mileage down from my previous highway run by almost 10 m.p.g. 78 miles, 28.2 m.p.g. TOTAL: 356 miles, 29.7 average m.p.g."

6/3/2006	Sales Are Up, and So Are Energy Prices	CONSUMERS were willing to open their wallets last month, but seem reluctant to do so in the near future. Energy companies, meanwhile, are eager to spend money and are likely to spend a lot more soon. These developments have something in common: energy prices. Gasoline near $3 a gallon and the prospect of high summer air-conditioning bills are spooking many consumers but are exciting energy executives looking to use their cash hoards to buy out rivals. Seeking to calm the financial markets, which were rattled by these changes and persistent signs of inflation, President Bush nominated a new Treasury secretary with ample credibility on Wall Street and Capital Hill. A NEW CAPTAIN -- With the dollar falling and the trade deficit rising, and with tax cuts bumping up against a sizable federal budget deficit, President Bush named Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Wall Street banker, to succeed John W. Snow as Treasury secretary.

Auto Plant	General Motors workers at a Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, in northwest England, staged a wildcat strike after newspaper reports that the company planned to eliminate 1,000 jobs at the factory. About 2,000 assembly-line employees stopped work during two daily shifts, David Crundwell, a Vauxhall spokesman, said. Mr. Crundwell declined to comment on reports of job cuts. The strike ''is an emotional reaction from a loyal and highly productive work force who are understandably fearful for their jobs and the future of the plant,'' Roger Maddison, national officer for the Amicus labor union, said in a statement.

4/30/2006	Challenging Toyota's Hybrid Hegemony	IF the crossword puzzle clue is ''hybrid car,'' the answer is probably ''Prius.'' Since Toyota brought that model to the United States six years ago, the company has basked in a green public-relations glow -- even though Honda was first with a modern gas-electric car (the Insight) and Ford sold the first hybrid S.U.V. (the Escape). But with a mix of creative engineering, clever promotion and fortunate timing, Toyota has set the de facto standard for the entire class of eco-friendly vehicles. It has licensed its software to Ford and is selling hybrid components to Nissan. Toyota has half a dozen hybrid models in showrooms or on the way -- twice as many as any other automaker -- ranging from the miserly Prius to the $100,000-plus Lexus LS 600hL.
4/28/2006	G.M. Entangled in Pay-for-Publicity Dispute	A public relations firm has apologized to General Motors after acknowledging that it may have offered money to former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich in exchange for public comments supporting the automaker's employee buyout program. The offer would violate General Motors's policy against payments to opinion makers. The firm's president, Richard Strauss of Strauss Radio Strategies in Washington, would not say if other commentators were offered payment for public support of the troubled automaker's buyout plan, which is intended to reduce sharply its work force of 113,000 hourly employees.
4/27/2006	Bush to Meet Big 3 for Talks On Fuel Issues And Pensions	President Bush, who touched a nerve this year when he told Detroit carmakers to build ''relevant'' vehicles, will meet with the companies' leaders next month, William Clay Ford Jr., the chief executive of Ford Motor, said Wednesday. People involved in planning the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the high level of the talks, said it would focus on three areas: energy and the environment; costs like pensions and health care premiums that add hundreds of dollars to the price of a Detroit car; and how currency issues affect the Japanese automakers.

Such was the state of the political battle over gas prices on Saturday, when Mr. Bush went to West Sacramento to tour the California Fuel Cell Partnership, a consortium of 31 car makers, energy companies and government agencies, and Democrats fired off press releases from Washington attacking the administration's energy plans.
4/23/2006	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Buick Lucerne; So Shipshape the Portholes Seem to Fit	HOW about those portholes? On the front fenders of the 2006 Lucerne they assume a stylized rectangular shape, as opposed to the original round VentiPorts that first appeared on 1949 Buicks, yet they still have no practical function. Originally meant to evoke the side exhausts of wonder cars like the Duesenberg, they now symbolize nothing so much as Buick's glory days, some 40 to 70 years in the rear-view mirror. In the intervening decades, Buick's portholes have come and gone, and they made a brief appearance on the Park Avenue as that big sedan faded away. They are back on the Lucerne, which replaces both the Park Avenue and the less expensive LeSabre in Buick's lineup, with three portholes on each side of V-6 models and four per front fender denoting a V-8 -- the first such engine in a Buick passenger car since 1995.
4/23/2006	What About G.M.? Oh, Just His Day Job	The extracurricular activities of Robert A. Lutz, the G.M. vice chairman, are well known. To avoid an hourlong commute, he sometimes flies his MD-500 helicopter to work. And he will gladly tell anyone who will listen about the bevy of military playthings he keeps at an airport hangar near his house. Now he has the business cards to prove it. In addition to his rather nondescript white G.M.-issued cards, Mr. Lutz, a former Marine pilot, has printed his own. They picture him wearing an Army-green flight suit, helmet in hand, and standing in front of his Alpha Jet, a French-German fighter jet. The card makes no mention of Mr. Lutz's position as one of the top executives of the world's largest automaker. Instead, they read simply, ''Bob Lutz -- Fighter Pilot.'' JEREMY W. PETER
4/22/2006	All Eyes on the Fed as Gas Prices and Inflation Rise	OIL prices climbed even higher this week, setting a nominal record on the New York Mercantile Exchange and stoking concern about inflation. After jumping on reports earlier in the week that the Federal Reserve might soon stop raising interest rates, the stock market retreated on the assumption that inflation would force the Fed to continue reining in the economy. DICEY PRICES -- Led by soaring gasoline prices, the inflation rate spiked last month, and for the first time some analysts detected evidence that volatile energy prices were beginning to seep into the rest of the economy and push up the cost of living generally.
4/22/2006	Corrections	A chart in Business Day on Wednesday with an article about the auto industry's efforts to rein in health care costs misstated the severance alternatives for some workers at General Motors. (The error also appeared in a chart on March 23.) Hourly workers nearing retirement who leave immediately will receive up to $2,900 a month until they reach their 30th anniversary of service. They must retire at that point and will receive a full pension. They cannot work in the interim, and the money is not in addition to their regular pay.
4/21/2006	G.M. Cut Loss In Quarter, But Increased Its Inventory	General Motors sharply reduced its loss in the first quarter, providing a much-needed breakthrough for a company battered by accounting missteps and doubts about the fate of its chief executive and of the automaker itself. Investors pushed G.M. shares higher Thursday, but analysts expressed concern about G.M.'s inventories, which are at higher-than-normal levels, and about the impact that rising fuel prices could have on the automaker's new sport utility vehicles and pickups, whose success is critical to its turnaround.
4/19/2006	The Calculus Of Taking The Buyout	Consciously or not, the tens of thousands of General Motors workers who face decisions about the company's buyout offers before an early June deadline are getting a crash course in medical cost-benefit analysis. The prospect of losing General Motors health coverage can be terrifying for workers who went straight from high school into factory jobs and have few good prospects for employment beyond the assembly line.
4/19/2006	The Doctor Will See the U.A.W.; Benefits Threatened, Auto Workers Line Up for Elective Procedures	The auto industry's efforts to rein in employee health costs is drawing an expensive reaction, as union workers and their spouses hurry to Michigan doctors for knee replacements and other elective procedures before they lose their comprehensive medical benefits. Hospitals, doctors and insurers have all noticed a surge in demand for elective surgery since last year when Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, led a public relations campaign to prepare auto workers for health care cutbacks, and Delphi, the G.M. parts supplier, filed for bankruptcy protection. Hip, knee and shoulder replacements at the Henry Ford Health System were ''up 20 percent in the second half of last year and remain strong,'' said Robert Riney, chief operating officer of the system, the largest hospital group in the Detroit area.
4/17/2006	A Sponsor and Its Show, Intertwined	LIKE modern-day Medicis hoping to discover the next Da Vinci, marketers are becoming patrons of programming. Increasingly, makers of consumer products are commissioning shows and series to appear on television, computers, cellphones and hand-held devices like iPods -- programs that typically would not be produced without the companies' financial support. Those taking part in the trend toward branded entertainment include Coca-Cola, Ford Motor, General Motors, JetBlue Airways, Meow Mix, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever.
4/16/2006	Looking a Bit Like Olds, Saturn Rolls Out the New	THE three pillars of automotive marketing, a Honda executive once told me, are price, product and customer service. After its start-up in 1990, Saturn won awards for its innovative way of making cars, including easy-to-replace plastic body panels. Dealers sold the cars with a no-haggle price policy. The service was legendary. But it's unlikely that Saturn has ever made a profit. (Its parent, General Motors, does not break out profits or losses by division.)
4/15/2006	Economy Meanders, but Gas Prices Stick to Trend	GOOD and getting better, or weak and getting worse. Both views on the economy had their believers amid mixed signals on energy prices, consumer attitudes, the job market and interest rates this week. STEPPING ON THE GAS -- Just in time for the summer driving season, gasoline prices began to rise across the country, topping $3 a gallon at some stations in New York, Los Angeles and some other major metropolitan areas. The increase was driven by political instability in major oil-producing countries, notably Iran, which is confronting the West over its uranium-enrichment program, and Nigeria, where government opponents have taken to attacking petroleum production plants. Together, these events pushed oil prices above $69 a barrel on world markets.
4/14/2006	G.M. Health Plan To Cut Earnings	General Motors expects to take a pretax charge of at least $1 billion in the first quarter related to its new retiree health care agreement, and the charge could increase to $3 billion as the automaker discusses the proper accounting treatment for it with regulators. In a regulatory filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, G.M. said it would make three contributions of $1 billion each in 2006, 2007 and 2011 to a new plan. A court approved the agreement on March 31.
4/14/2006	If Detroit Calls, U.S. May Not Replay the Bailout Role	Gasoline prices are rising. Sales of Detroit's carmakers suffer as Japanese brands carve out a growing share of the American market. One of the nation's largest automobile manufacturers flirts with bankruptcy. Sound familiar?
4/13/2006	BOLDFACE	A Lesson for the Children Saturn was celebrating the unveiling of three new cars in Times Square on Tuesday night at something called Saturn Rocks Times Square. The event, which was a benefit for DKMS, a bone marrow donor foundation, was at the Hard Rock Cafe. CAMP FREDDY performed, and as everyone knows -- and don't pretend you don't, lovely little Upper East Side ladies! -- Camp Freddy is made up of BILLY MORRISON, DAVE NAVARRO, MATT SORUM, SCOTT WEILAND and DONOVAN LEITCH.
4/13/2006	G.M. Vice Chairman Rebuffs Critics of Turnaround	The vice chairman of General Motors, Robert A. Lutz, yesterday offered the company's bluntest rebuff yet of critics who say a turnaround at the ailing automaker is failing to gain steam. Taking on Wall Street analysts, the media and even President Bush, Mr. Lutz accused G.M.'s critics of having a ''herd mentality'' and overlooking significant steps the company has taken toward financial stability.
4/12/2006	G.M. Plans to Sell Its 7.9% Stake in Isuzu	General Motors said Tuesday that it would sell the last of its large stakes in a Japanese carmaker, 7.9 percent of Isuzu Motors, for $300 million. It is the third time since October that G.M. has sold off a stake in a Japanese auto concern, dissolving equity partnerships built up over more than three decades, to raise cash that it needs for an overhaul at home. G.M. has already earned $2.7 billion from the sale of shares of Suzuki Motor and Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru.
4/11/2006	Chinese Partner of G.M. and VW to Offer Its Own Cars	The Chinese automaker that has joint ventures with General Motors and Volkswagen announced details Monday of plans to sell its own cars in China later this year and to export cars to Europe next year. The plans highlight how Chinese companies, no longer satisfied with using cheap labor to manufacture car designs from the United States, Germany and Japan, are determined to turn into international competitors in their own right. To do that, they are relying on Western technology.
4/11/2006	MEMO PAD	IMPROVING HOTEL LOYALTY -- As faith declines in the airlines' frequent-flier mileage programs, business travelers are giving high marks to frequent-stay programs at hotels, according to a new survey by the management consulting company Accenture. In a survey of business travelers belonging to frequent-stay programs, 31 percent said that hotels now recognized them as loyal customers and tailored reservations to fit their stated preferences. When Accenture last surveyed business travelers on the subject last October, only 18 percent said that hotel loyalty programs were providing personalized services like choices of floors and pillows. Paul Chiu, managing partner in Accenture's travel services sector, said that the change partly reflected improvements that hotels made in technology to process loyalty program reservations. On the other hand, accumulation of points in a hotel loyalty program is the least important factor business travelers cite in choosing a hotel. Proximity to business meetings is the top factor. THE BEST AIRPORTS -- Incheon International Airport in South Korea, about 35 miles west of Seoul, was chosen as the best airport worldwide in a survey jointly conducted by the Airports Council International and the International Air Transport Association. Singapore Changi International Airport and Hong Kong International Airport tied for second place; Kuala Lumpur International Airport came in third. Results were compiled from more than 100,000 questionnaires filled out by passengers who rated airport comforts, convenience and services like shopping and ground transportation. RECEIPTS BY E-MAIL -- The more than 24 million members of Marriott International's Marriott Rewards loyalty program can now opt to have their hotel bill receipts e-mailed to them. The e-mail program is already available for corporate accounts and the company said it planned to extend the service to all guests later this year. STEP ON THE GAS IN VEGAS -- A thrill ride that requires a breathalyzer test? Only in Las Vegas, where General Motors has opened an attraction called The Drive at the Sahara Hotel and Casino. For $10, you get to test various G.M. high-performance vehicles on either a loop (four laps) or an off-road course (two laps). Drivers must be 18 or older and, yes, they are serious about the breathalyzer test. SURGING CHINA TRAVEL -- The growing number of luxury hotels dotting the skyline in Shanghai is evidence that business and leisure travel to China is booming. In 2005, there were a record 120 million foreign visitors to China, according to Asia Times Online. That compares with 230,000 foreign visitors in 1978. EXPANDING STAR -- Swiss International Air Lines became the 17th member of the Star Alliance on Friday and South Africa Airways joined yesterday to become the 18th. Airline alliances like Star allow passengers from one carrier to easily book flights on partner carriers and earn frequent-flier miles on them, while allowing airline members to add their routes to larger worldwide networks. Star Alliance, whose other members include major airlines like Lufthansa, Singapore, United and US Airways, has 15,500 daily flights serving 842 destinations in 152 countries. (JOE SHARKEY)
4/8/2006	Court Approves Delphi Early-Retirement Plan	The Delphi Corporation, the auto parts company, received bankruptcy court approval yesterday to offer early retirement incentives to 13,000 employees as part of a plan to cut labor costs. The General Motors Corporation, the former parent of Delphi, will pay for the program, including $35,000 to any Delphi employee who accepts early retirement. G.M. estimated that it might file an unsecured claim against Delphi for as much as $4 billion to recoup some of the costs.
4/8/2006	G.M., Lucent and CBS Tackle Some Problems	FIXING lingering problems was at the top of the agenda for many big companies this week, from automakers to television networks. BURNING FURNITURE? General Motors hustled to raise much-needed cash by selling assets, notably a majority stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, for $7.4 billion immediately, with $10 billion expected by closing and a total of $14 billion over three years.
4/4/2006	Chevy Tries a Write-Your-Own-Ad Approach, and the Potshots Fly	At first glance, the video looks like a typical 30-second car commercial: a shiny sport utility vehicle careers down a country road lined with sunflower fields, jaunty music playing in the background. Then, white lettering appears on the screen: ''$70 to fill up the tank, which will last less than 400 miles. Chevy Tahoe.''
4/4/2006	G.M. Board Gives Chief Some Time	The board of General Motors expressed support Monday for Rick Wagoner, the company's embattled chief executive, as G.M. announced a long-anticipated deal to sell a majority stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, for $7.4 billion. It marked the board's first public comment on Mr. Wagoner since a spate of recent bad news, but analysts said it did not indicate unconditional backing. Indeed, accounting missteps prompted a board investigation two weeks ago after one error forced G.M. to increase its losses in 2005 by $2 billion, to $10.6 billion.
4/4/2006	U.S. Vehicle Sales Fall 2.9%, Dragged Down by G.M.	A sharp drop at General Motors helped push down auto sales nationwide in March, despite pitches from American carmakers for consumers to take advantage of the latest deals. G.M.'s ''March Madness'' promotion did little to end the skid in sales, while incentives at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler also seemed to do little to lift overall results.
4/3/2006	G.M. to Sell Majority Stake in Finance Unit	General Motors is expected to announce a deal today to sell a majority stake in its financing arm, GMAC, to a group of investors led by Cerberus Capital Management for about $8 billion in cash, according to people involved in the negotiations. The complex deal could be worth as much as $14 billion total over time, these people said. The transaction could give General Motors some breathing room at a time when it is under increasing pressure to stabilize its finances, and as investors grow worried that the company could fall into bankruptcy. Still, some analysts question whether the sale of GMAC will be any more than a short-term fix.
4/2/2006	Hand in Hand, Over the Precipice	FOR years, thoughtful people yearned for labor and management in the United States to work in concert rather than at loggerheads. If only workers and auto companies could row in unison, the thinking went, Detroit might at last be able to compete against the Japanese. As it turns out, workers and managers in the American auto industry have been rowing in unison, albeit directly toward the cataract. Giving new meaning to the term ''labor-management cooperation,'' union leaders and General Motors executives joined forces years ago. However unwittingly, they have been working hand in glove ever since to wreck the place. Bringing G.M. to its knees is a big job, after all, and neither side could have done it alone. Only by working together not to rock the boat has it been possible to steer such a dominant player aground, deprive future generations of jobs and profits and send entire cities into extended decline. It's enough to make you wonder if we might have been better off with more old-fashioned labor strife.
4/2/2006	A Job for Life? G.M. Puts an End To That Fading Idea	For some time now, there have been rumblings about the gradual end of that cuddly, outdated phenomenon in which a worker landed a job in his early 20's and could, if he so desired, keep it for life. (Forgive the sexist pronouns, but this really is a holdover from the days when it was basically men at work and women in the kitchen.) Well, with General Motors' recent offer to pay any of its 113,000 union employees in North America to give up that guarantee, the word ''gradual'' may no longer apply. History could show this as the moment when the system finally stumbles to a halt -- no matter how many workers actually accept G.M.'s offer. G.M. was ''the last bastion of the lifetime employment system,'' said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm.
4/1/2006	Jitters Over Rate Increases and the Auto Business	QUESTION: Is a fast-growing economy good news or bad? Answer: Normally good, of course, but not always -- at least not if robust growth encourages the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates. That, at least, was the collective conclusion of the stock market last week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 96 points in the minutes after the Fed released its latest rate decision. Investors' moods were not helped by the prospect of a potentially damaging labor-management showdown in the auto industry. HIGHER AND HIGHER -- As expected, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent. As feared, it suggested that even more increases were coming.
4/1/2006	CAR PARTS MAKER MOVES TO BREAK ITS UNION DEALS	Delphi, the nation's biggest auto parts maker, on Friday asked a federal judge for permission to throw out some of its labor agreements, a move that could cost 20,000 union workers their jobs and leave thousands of others with less than half their current wages. Delphi, which is operating in bankruptcy, wants the judge's permission to impose sharply lower wages and benefits on six unions, setting up a confrontation that its largest union, the United Automobile Workers, said could lead to a lengthy strike.
4/1/2006	Cuts in Benefits for G.M. Retirees Approved	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest private provider of health care, won a federal judge's approval yesterday to proceed with $1 billion in cuts in the benefits of its retired workers. The cuts will require more than 475,000 retirees and their dependents to pay part of their health insurance premiums for the first time. The annual cost will be as much as $752 a family.
3/29/2006	At G.M.'s Helm Or Going Under?; Critics Zero In on Rick Wagoner	In 1992, with General Motors in the worst financial crisis in its storied history, its board ousted top management and brought in a fresh slate of executives with orders to burst through the automaker's turgid culture. The youngest was its 39-year-old chief financial officer, Rick Wagoner, a virtual unknown outside the company who was as shocked as everyone else when he was summoned back from G.M.'s operations in Brazil for a post that usually went to men a decade or two his senior. He helped fashion a turnaround plan that stemmed the bleeding and put G.M. back on the road to profitability.
3/29/2006	G.M. Lays Off Hundreds of White-Collar Employees	General Motors laid off several hundred white-collar workers on Tuesday, its latest move in a restructuring plan that is cutting deeply into all ranks of the company. Also on Tuesday, a top United Automobile Workers official said he expected the auto parts supplier Delphi to ask a bankruptcy judge to throw out its labor contracts Friday. Such a move would raise the likelihood of a strike at Delphi, which could cripple production at G.M.
3/29/2006	G.M. Will Also Restate Results for Its Finance Unit	Two weeks after it increased its 2005 loss by $2 billion, General Motors said Tuesday that it would restate several years worth of results for its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. The automaker also said it did not know if it would be able to sell a controlling interest in G.M.A.C. because of the complexity of arranging a deal. G.M. put part of the unit up for sale in October in an effort to raise cash for a wide-ranging corporate revamping.
3/28/2006	G.M.'s Jobs Bank Looms as Major Obstacle on Road to Survival	At the General Motors assembly plant on the barren outskirts of Oklahoma City there are 2,300 reminders of why the company needs to persuade tens of thousands of workers to take the buyouts it offered last week. Each day, workers report for duty at the plant and pass their time reading, watching television, playing dominoes or chatting. Since G.M. shut down production there last month, these workers have entered the Jobs Bank, industry's best form of job insurance. It pays idled workers a full salary and benefits even when there is no work for them to do.
3/28/2006	In a Tough Market, G.M. Hopes for a Rebound in S.U.V. Sales	General Motors said Monday that heightened competition and a soft market for sport utility vehicles would complicate the company's recovery this year. ''When we look at what competitors are doing in the marketplace, it is a very aggressive operating environment,'' said Paul Ballew, the chief sales analyst for General Motors, in a presentation to analysts and the media.
3/28/2006	Delphi Is Said to Offer Unions a One-Time Sweetener	With a Friday deadline to reach a deal with its labor unions approaching, the auto parts supplier Delphi has proposed giving its factory workers $50,000 in exchange for a 40 percent reduction in pay, union officials who have been briefed on the plan said Monday. The plan also calls for General Motors, which spun off Delphi in 1999, to subsidize part of the plan's cost, but it could not be determined how much G.M. would contribute.
3/26/2006	How to Look At a Gift Horse	Last week, General Motors, in a cost-cutting move, offered to pay 113,000 hourly workers and 13,000 workers at the Delphi Corporation to quit their jobs. That may sound like dream fulfilled to many people, but are G.M.'s buyouts really a good deal?
3/25/2006	G.M. Offers Pay for Its Workers to Go Away	KNOCKED on their heels, several companies struggled with setbacks this week. General Motors and Microsoft took steps to cope with problems long in coming, while federal prosecutors were staggered by a reversal in a very visible corporate corruption case. SILVER HANDSHAKES -- Unable to sell enough cars to keep its employees busy, General Motors offered to pay them to go away. In an agreement with the United Automobile Workers union, G.M. offered $35,000 to $140,000 to its 113,000 employees in North America if they agreed to leave their jobs. It also extended the offer to more than 20,000 employees of its quasi-independent supplier, Delphi.
3/24/2006	What's Bad for G.M.	General Motors is in deep trouble. Each attempt to pull itself out seems to draw only more attention to how far it has sunk. It would be easy to write off the company, but we can't. We all want to see G.M. get out of this. The automaker has long been an icon of the American middle class. G.M.'s current problems remind us of how the disappearing blue-collar middle class struggles mightily to fend for itself in the face of stagnant wages and job insecurity. When the automaker extends a blanket offer to buy out every one of its 113,000 unionized workers in the United States, as it did earlier this week, its troubles are the embodiment of our fears. G.M. worsens the nagging worry about an America without the kinds of jobs that can provide the salaries needed to support families, good health care and a secure retirement.
3/24/2006	G.M. Sells Big Stake In Loan Unit	General Motors sold a 78 percent stake in its commercial mortgage business, one part of its vast financing division, to an investor group on Thursday, the latest move in the struggling automaker's efforts to raise cash. The deal includes $1.5 billion in cash and the repayment of about $7.3 billion in intercompany loans. The sale came a day after G.M. announced a landmark deal with the United Automobile Workers union that will offer buyouts to all 113,000 of its hourly workers in the United States.
3/23/2006	Once Set for Life, Auto Workers May Have to Gamble	For General Motors workers who once thought they were set for life, the buyouts the company offered Wednesday may well represent the first real gamble of their careers: Do they stay with G.M. and hope for a turnaround or take the money and run? Ron Linn, an electrician at G.M.'s Flint Truck Assembly plant, is taking his chances. Having just remarried and purchased a new house, Mr. Linn, 52, said he planned on working at least another five years before he retired.
3/23/2006	G.M. Will Offer Buyouts To All Its Union Workers	General Motors reached a landmark agreement Wednesday with the United Automobile Workers intended to reduce sharply the ranks of a generation of auto workers long envied by other blue-collar workers for their wages and benefits. G.M., staggering under the weight of $10.6 billion in losses last year, said it would offer buyouts and early-retirement packages ranging from $35,000 to $140,000 to every one of its 113,000 unionized workers in the United States who agreed to leave the company.
3/22/2006	Getting Auto Workers to Leave a Golden Job	The challenge that General Motors, Delphi and the United Automobile Workers have encountered in their talks on early retirement programs reflects the complexity in devising the perfect buyout. The departure package is a crucial element in enticing workers off the payrolls at both General Motors and Delphi, which are now negotiating with the U.A.W. over the future of thousands of workers at both companies.
3/21/2006	Delphi Put Dominoes In Motion	When Delphi sought bankruptcy protection in October, its chief executive, Robert S. Miller Jr., painted the filing as a watershed moment, one that would lead to a long-needed restructuring of the auto industry. That may happen, but for now, Delphi's bankruptcy has become a scalding witch's brew that has engulfed General Motors and the United Automobile Workers. It has also splashed over other auto parts suppliers that followed Delphi into Chapter 11.
3/19/2006	The Sedan That Says 'Stuff It'	TESTED: Chevrolet Malibu Maxx WHAT IS IT? Four-door midsize sedan with a hatch in lieu of a trunk. WHAT MAKES IT RUN? 3.5-liter pushrod V-6 (201 horsepower); four-speed automatic; front-wheel drive. HOW MUCH? Base LT $20,790, LTZ $24,090. Test car $24,240 including $1,270 option group 1SB (front-seat side air bags, side curtain bags, rear audio controls with headphones, six-way power driver's seat, remote starter), $995 DVD entertainment system. A $750 rebate (or discount financing) is currently offered. HOW THIRSTY? E.P.A. rating is 22 m.p.g. city, 30 highway. ALTERNATIVES: Mazda 6i hatchback $23,670; Mazda 6s wagon $25,120; Dodge Magnum SE $23,255. AS it struggles to regain market share, General Motors promises nothing short of a revolution in the number of new or redesigned vehicles it is bringing to market. One of the first cars in this product wave was the Malibu Maxx, a practical hatchback sedan that somehow manages to look both distinctive and a bit drab.
3/18/2006	Trading the Hummer for a Honda	For Janna Jensen, it was the dirty looks and nasty gestures from other drivers that finally persuaded her to give up the family's $55,000 Hummer H2. Her husband, Michael, meanwhile, was tired of the $300 monthly gasoline cost and the quality problems that began soon after they bought it. So the Jensens of Reno, Nev., dumped the sport utility vehicle this year for a more modest Honda Element, still an S.U.V. but one with better gasoline mileage and a lower profile than the H2. And they are not alone.
3/18/2006	That Other Madness This Month: Mergers	MARCH madness is not limited to college basketball. Billions of dollars in mergers were announced this week, building on the momentum created when AT&T offered to acquire BellSouth for $67 billion earlier in the month.
3/18/2006	Now G.M. Has Woes On Audits	There was a time when General Motors was seen as the paragon of financial quality. Its bonds were rated triple A, and it was known for the most conservative accounting. Let other companies use liberal accounting rules to make results look better; G.M. did not need such things. The announcement late Thursday that General Motors would revise profit figures for every year of this decade, and would have to restate the 2005 earnings it had already reported, shows how far the icon has fallen. Less than a year after it lost its investment-grade bond rating, its bonds are viewed as middling even among junk bonds.
3/17/2006	General Motors Accounts May Be Up for Grabs	AFTER decades of standing pat on its agency lineup, the troubled automaker General Motors is finally taking steps to shake things up. General Motors is famous on Madison Avenue for being loyal to the agencies on its roster. Campbell-Ewald, for example, has created campaigns for the Chevrolet brand since 1914. ''The wheel wasn't invented then,'' one agency executive who works for G.M. said facetiously.
3/17/2006	G.M. Loss For 2005 Is Steeper	General Motors on Thursday reported a revised and steeper loss for 2005, increasing the amount to $10.6 billion, or $2 billion more than it reported in January. G.M. said the revision was the result of higher costs of scaling back its North American operations and of helping its former parts subsidiary, Delphi, restructure while in bankruptcy protection.
3/16/2006	Union Is Pessimistic on a Deal To Avert a Shutdown at Delphi	Leaders of the United Automobile Workers union, who met Wednesday in Detroit, said they doubted that a deal could be reached on an assistance plan for the Delphi Corporation before a deadline on March 31. Without an agreement by the union and General Motors, Delphi, an auto parts supplier that is under bankruptcy protection, says it will ask a judge for permission to set aside its labor contracts and impose sharply lower wages. The U.A.W. has threatened to strike if that happens.
3/12/2006	Call Him Ishmael. (He Has the Whale.)	''MY man is all in white, and I like that!'' Will Castro, 40-something celebrity car customizer, exclaimed, focusing on an older man who had driven up in a white Cadillac. ''White suit, white shoes -- white glasses, even.'' The Cadillac man said, ''I want to improve my street credibility.''
3/12/2006	Thanks to Detroit, China Is Poised to Lead	VOLKSWAGEN and other carmakers used to prosper by sending outdated factory equipment to China to produce older models no longer salable in the West. But competition has become so fierce here that Honda is about to introduce its latest version of the Civic only several months after it went on sale in Europe, Japan and the United States. Toyota, meanwhile, is assembling its Prius gasoline-electric sedan only in Japan and China. When Ford Motor opened its first production line here in western China just three years ago, it used a layout copied from a Ford factory in the Philippines to produce 20,000 sedans a year based on a small car design taken from Ford operations in India.
3/9/2006	Union Leaders at Delphi Plan To Meet and Review G.M. Talks	Leaders of union locals at the Delphi Corporation, the auto parts maker, will meet next week in Detroit to be briefed on negotiations with General Motors on a rescue plan, officials with the union, the United Automobile Workers, said on Wednesday night. The meeting will be at the U.A.W.-G.M. Center for Human Resources, according to a notice sent to union leaders.
3/8/2006	G.M. Freezes Pension Plan of Its Salaried Workers	The General Motors Corporation announced extensive changes to the retirement plans of its salaried employees on Tuesday, a decision that will cut its pension costs by $1.6 billion this year and lead to lower benefits for workers. G.M. said it would freeze its defined-benefits pension plan and shift to less-expensive retirement programs for 42,000 workers in the United States.
3/7/2006	G.M. Raising Some Cash With Sale of Most of Suzuki Stake	As General Motors sells most of its 21 percent stake in the Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor, providing a cash infusion after huge losses, analysts are wondering if the move will be enough to appease G.M.'s disgruntled shareholders. The sale has also raised speculation about what G.M. plans to do with its 7.9 percent stake in Isuzu Motors. G.M. will sell about 92 million shares, or a 17.4 percent stake, back to Suzuki for 230 billion yen ($1.98 billion) on Tuesday, the companies said. Analysts said Suzuki might have to spread itself dangerously thin to come up with the cash on short notice to buy its shares back from G.M.
3/6/2006	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Technology; Test Cars Keep Returning To a Town's Icy Embrace	WITH spring's arrival just weeks away -- and the prospect of winter's icy grip finally relenting -- a principal attraction of this remote Ontario outpost is fading quickly. Its draw is not one that communities normally promote: a climate that, for nearly half of the year, is exceptionally cold and exceptionally snowy. These are not the sort of conditions that lure college students on spring break, but the thermometer's annual sustained plunge does bring a regular migration to this town of 9,000, about 16 hours' drive north of Detroit, and to Timmins, about 100 miles to the southeast. The visitors are not sun-seeking vacationers but engineers with test vehicles from General Motors, Toyota and other automakers.
3/5/2006	NEUTRAL, PLEASE	General Motors' outspoken vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, acknowledged that he was a little too outspoken last week. On Monday, Mr. Lutz said G.M.'s newest director, Jerome B. York, had withdrawn his call that G.M. get rid of its Saab and Hummer brands. Mr. Lutz said Mr. York, a close associate of G.M.'s biggest individual shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, had made the comments before joining the G.M. board on Feb. 6. ''He realizes that it was a suggestion he wouldn't have made if he knew all the facts,'' Mr. Lutz said.
3/4/2006	Chrysler's Goal: Keep Success but Lose Incentives	By all rights, Chrysler should be celebrating its status as the most successful Detroit automaker. Instead, like a tightrope walker facing a stiff gale, Chrysler's ability to keep moving forward is being sorely tested. Proof of that sits in a field across from Willow Run Airport west of Detroit, one of nation's busiest for air cargo traffic. Dozens of Jeeps sit in full view of passing planes and motorists, snow collecting on their hoods and roofs.
3/2/2006	Both Ford And G.M. Scale Back	Both General Motors and Ford said Wednesday they would scale back production in the second quarter, a move that reflects their falling sales and shrinking market share in the United States. As has been the case for much of the last year, Asian automakers' sales grew steadily last month. Honda's sales rose the most, with an 8.7 percent increase. Toyota, which has become accustomed to double-digit monthly gains, had a more modest 2.4 percent increase last month.
2/21/2006	For G.M. In Russia, Parts Dispute Is Only a Start	General Motors, which in the United States struggles with ballooning pension and benefits payments, among other things, has more basic troubles in Russia -- the company was without engines for 11 days this month. G.M. said Monday that it had settled a dispute with a Russian business partner over the price of engines and other parts, and that production would resume Tuesday.
2/20/2006	Company Town Relies on G.M. Long After Plants Have Closed	General Motors once had so many plants here that it had to stagger their schedules so that the streets would not be clogged with traffic when the workday ended. At the city's peak, 35 years ago, one of every three people in Anderson worked for G.M. Now there is not a single G.M. plant left, and just two parts plants that G.M. once owned still survive. Anderson, about 50 miles northeast of Indianapolis, had 70,000 people in 1970 and now has fewer than 58,000.
2/19/2006	A Halo Truck Gets Its Wings	TESTED: 2006 Chevrolet SSR WHAT IS IT? Two-door pickup that doubles as a roadster-convertible. HOW MUCH? $39,890 base. $47,795 as tested with $815 manual transmission; $3,200 Preferred Equipment Group 3SS (includes heated seats with memory, running boards, premium audio); $1,995 chrome wheels; $1,000 chrome interior package; $895 simulated oak trim in cargo compartment. WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD? 6-liter V-8 (400 horsepower) with 4-speed automatic or 6-speed manual. E.P.A. MILEAGE: 13 m.p.g. city, 20 highway. (Observed overall mileage: 17.) GENERAL MOTORS' marketing mavens thought they had a sure thing when they rushed the head-turning SSR design study, the toast of the 2000 Detroit auto show, into production in 2003. Part retro truck (think 1949 Chevy pickup), part two-seat hardtop convertible (think Mercedes SLK), it would surely ride the same wave of nostalgia that made the New Beetle and Mini Cooper such hits.
2/19/2006	Alternative Fuel Loses Another Alternative	THE nation may be addicted to oil, as President Bush warned in his State of the Union address last month, but at least some American consumers seem willing to break the habit. Numbers of Toyota Prius owners and other hybrid-vehicle enthusiasts are slowly weaning themselves off the crude. And a small sliver of drivers have gone cold turkey -- swearing off gasoline altogether to fuel up on compressed natural gas, French fry grease and all manner of animal fats.
2/19/2006	Editors' Note	An article on Feb. 5 about changes in the American auto market contrasted its two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford, with the next four -- Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. It said that while those four were expected to have a combined worldwide profit of $22 billion for 2005, G.M. and Ford together had a loss of $6.6 billion worldwide. The article should have noted that G.M. reported a loss of $8.6 billion while Ford reported an overall profit of $2 billion, although Ford lost $1.6 billion from its North American auto operations.
2/18/2006	Delphi Continues Talking to Unions, but Contracts Are Still in Peril	The Delphi Corporation, which is operating in bankruptcy, said Friday that it would keep talking with its unions and General Motors in a bid to reach a deal on lower wage and benefit rates. Delphi, which is the country's biggest auto parts company, set a new deadline of March 31 for a deal. If there is no deal by then, Delphi said, it will ask a judge for permission to reject its labor contracts with its six unions, and also ask to terminate its employee pension plans.
2/18/2006	A Contrarian Says of G.M.: Buy Low	THE decision by General Motors to halve its dividend has left many investors unconvinced of the company's ability to solve the chronic problems that threaten its position as the world's largest carmaker. The rush by analysts to renew sell recommendations show how poorly the company is regarded. Yet a brave few dissenters see a glimmer of hope in its recovery efforts. And with the stock clinging to the low $20's after trading above $50 two years ago, they contend, that hope comes cheaply enough to warrant buying the shares.
2/14/2006	G.M. to Invest $500 Million In Michigan	General Motors is set to announce Tuesday that it has made, or plans to make, investments totaling $500 million to help modernize five of its Michigan factories. The automaker said it had scheduled a news conference for Tuesday afternoon at its manufacturing headquarters in Pontiac, north of Detroit. On Monday night, a company spokesman declined to discuss the nature of the announcement.
2/12/2006	The Smaller Approach	To the Editor: Re ''Carmakers' Big Idea: Think Small'' (Feb. 5): If they can begin to think in terms of smaller cars with smaller-displacement fuel-efficient engines, G.M. and Ford may well survive.
2/11/2006	Wondering Whether General Motors Can Stage Yet Another Comeback	GENERAL MOTORS, once among the strongest of American companies, this week cut its dividend in half amid fears that it may eventually go bankrupt. It remains the world's largest carmaker, but Toyota may soon catch up. For General Motors shareholders over the last 45 years, a quick look at the stock price chart indicates that it has been a long road to nowhere. An investor who bought one share at the end of 1960, and did not reinvest dividends or distributions, now has two shares, worth about the same number of dollars he paid.
2/11/2006	Pressure of Various Sorts on Some Corporate Giants	BIG companies were in big trouble with many of their shareholders this week, whether because they were too slow in cutting some things, like their payroll or their dividends, or too quick to count other things, like their sales. TIME'S A-WASTIN' -- Time Warner took a big step toward slimming down by agreeing to sell its book publishing unit a day before its most vocal shareholder, the corporate raider Carl C. Icahn, made public a plan by the investment bank Lazard to break the company into four pieces, sharply reduce expenses and buy back shares to raise its stock price.
2/9/2006	Benefits Go The Way Of Pensions	For years, the benefit packages of General Motors were considered to be so good that the company was known among workers and retirees as Generous Motors. But now even G.M., struggling to maintain its grip in the global auto industry, is being forced to bow to a changing competitive landscape and join the ranks of hundreds of other companies that are moving to unburden themselves of as much of the cost of supporting their retired work force as they can.
2/8/2006	Toyota's Profit Rises 34% On Strong Global Sales	Toyota posted a record quarterly profit for the end of December, an increase of 34.1 percent over the previous year, placing Japan's largest automaker within striking distance of overtaking General Motors this year for the title of world's largest automaker. Net income for the last three months of 2005 reached 398 billion yen ($3.4 billion) on record quarterly sales and help from the weakening of the yen, which fell to 117 yen to the dollar, from 106 yen to the dollar during the October-to-December quarter. Currency depreciation added $1.1 billion to Toyota's operating profits of $4.1 billion for the period.
2/8/2006	G.M. Trimming Executive Pay And Dividend	General Motors, under pressure to show its blue-collar workers that investors and executives are also prepared to give up something in order to help overcome the company's deepest losses in more than a decade, said Tuesday that it would reduce pay for top officials and cut its stock dividend by half. G.M., still clinging to its status as the world's largest auto company, also announced changes in the pension and health care plans for its retired salaried workers as it struggles to turn around its operations and avoid a potential bankruptcy.
2/7/2006	G.M. Adds Blunt Critic To Board	Opening its doors to a high-profile critic, the General Motors Corporation gave a seat on its board on Monday to Jerome B. York, an adviser to G.M.'s biggest individual investor, the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. G.M. also said that E. Stanley O'Neal, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, had resigned as a G.M. director.
2/5/2006	Two Ways to Skin 500 Horses; A Blistering Time Machine	THE turnpike exit was not the one I had planned to take, but I found myself at the bottom of the off ramp anyway, waving the E-ZPass tag at the toll booth and merging onto Route 18. Overruling the plan to continue farther south, a Corvette and my subconscious conspired to drop me into a different, but still familiar, landscape. With no particular timetable or goal -- other than to put some miles on the most powerful car Chevrolet has ever built, the 2006 Corvette Z06 -- I did not resist. A slight detour took me along a stretch of Highway 9, mythologized by a local singer named Springsteen, and still got me to the Jersey Shore where my exploits with cars began.
2/5/2006	MYSTERY SOLVED	Journalists at the Detroit auto show were a bit puzzled to run into Steven J. Harris, General Motors' popular former chief spokesman. Was Mr. Harris, who retired from G.M. in 2003, on a busman's holiday? Or was G.M., whose image has been battered, looking for advice?
2/5/2006	Carmakers' Big Idea: Think Small	THE writer E. F. Schumacher would be proud. Across the automobile market in America, there is an evolving realization that small is beautiful. No longer do the industry's two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, dominate the industry -- not in profits, sales or buzz. The hottest action is now taking place among the next four companies: Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, and the Japanese automakers Toyota, Honda and Nissan.
2/3/2006	G.M. Shifts Information Technology Contracts	General Motors said Thursday that it would spend up to $15 billion over the next five years to contract out information technology services. Electronic Data Systems, its former subsidiary, will remain the biggest supplier but will receive less work. G.M. awarded contracts to six companies, including E.D.S., I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. G.M. said the contracts were driven by the terms of a 10-year spinoff agreement with E.D.S. that ends in June.
2/2/2006	Selling a U.S. Behemoth For Europe's Narrow Roads	Paul Chedid likes to think of himself as a dealer in luxury goods -- not so uncommon in a country that has brought forth brands like Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. Except for one thing: Mr. Chedid sells Hummers. ''Cartier is not found in a supermarket,'' he said, explaining his strategy of selling the behemoths by positioning them in dealerships for Lamborghini, Ferrari or Porsche. ''If it is, then it's not Cartier.''
1/30/2006	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; At Chevy, SS Meant Something Special	THE retro movement among automakers, it turns out, is more than skin deep. While car companies around the world have done well with new models that recall the shape of classic body styles -- updated Minis, Mustangs and Beetles have all clicked with buyers -- there is also an appetite for icons of high performance from the past. Chrysler's revival of the Hemi nameplate, evoking the powerful imagery of a brute-force V-8 from the heyday of muscle cars, has contributed to the company's improving fortunes.
1/29/2006	Putting the Motor City Back in Gear	THE American car industry bled some more last week. Ford said it would cut 30,000 jobs and close 14 plants, while General Motors reported an $8.6 billion loss for 2005. It was, said James P. Womack, a manufacturing expert, ''the sad story of two armies in retreat, a retreat that is feeling more and more like a rout.''
1/27/2006	G.M. Posts Worst Loss Since 1992	By the middle of this decade, Rick Wagoner promised a few years ago, General Motors would again be king of the American road. The company would have dozens of new products aimed at beating foreign automakers, Mr. Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said in 2002. With those new cars and trucks, G.M. would rebuild market share and its profits would help it stay ahead of the high cost of providing health care.
1/26/2006	Kerkorian Repurchases G.M. Stake	He's back. The Tracinda Corporation, owned by the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, said on Wednesday that it had repurchased 12 million shares in General Motors stock that it had sold late last year to cover tax obligations, giving Mr. Kerkorian the same stake he held before the sale.
1/24/2006	Trying to Find the Road Ahead	With its bonds downgraded to junk and its market share on the ropes, Detroit's auto industry almost looks to be in a free fall. Ford Motor Company's announcement yesterday that after three straight quarters of North American losses, it will close as many as 14 factories and eliminate up to 30,000 jobs by 2012 is another sign of dark days in the Motor City. What's really sad is that Ford is in such bad shape that few people think the restructuring and job cuts are too aggressive, even though they were larger than many auto industry analysts had been expecting. That's not all that surprising when you consider that earlier this month, the Chinese automaker Geely did something no Chinese company had ever done. At Detroit's auto show, it unveiled a Chinese car that Geely plans to upgrade and sell in the United States in 2008. The price for what could be China's first foray into America's overheated love affair with cars: around $10,000.
1/22/2006	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Saab 9-7X; G.M. Serves Up a Swedish Meatball	NOT long ago, a Saab dealership was a thinly stocked place. Potential customers had just four models to pick from: two sedans, including an odd-shaped hatchback, a wagon and a cozy convertible. This was hardly enough to keep an automaker in the big leagues; most dealers made ends meet by selling other makes.
1/22/2006	STOCK ANSWER	At the Automotive News World Congress in Dearborn, Mich., last week, Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Automobile Workers, was deftly answering questions fired at him by the publisher of Automotive News, Keith Crain, when one query gave him pause. ''Would you invest in G.M. stock?'' Mr. Crain asked, to which Mr. Gettelfinger shot back, ''Where have you got your stock?''
1/19/2006	Thomas Murphy, 90, Leader of G.M. In 1970's Prosperity	Thomas A. Murphy, who led General Motors for most of the 1970's, died Wednesday at his home in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 90. His death was announced by General Motors.
1/14/2006	G.M. Chief Says Results Will Improve	The chief executive of General Motors, which lost $3.8 billion in the first three quarters of 2005, said yesterday that results will ''improve'' this year and next, but he did not say when the company would return to profit. G.M. will increase cost cuts beyond the $7 billion annualized reduction expected by the end of this year, the chief executive, Rick Wagoner, told analysts yesterday in Dearborn, Mich. Uncertainty about costs from the Oct. 8 bankruptcy of G.M.'s former auto parts unit, the Delphi Corporation, and other expenses make it difficult to say when losses will end, he said.
1/13/2006	Toyota Shows Big Three How It's Done; For U.S. Makers, Lessons In Efficiency and Cost Control	As General Motors and Ford struggle to remake themselves and rejoin the car wars, one company is proving what a successful American carmaker can look like: Toyota. Unlike G.M. and Ford, bogged down by dozens of models competing for the same buyers, Toyota has a well-chosen lineup of both bread-and-butter cars and trucks that sell in big volumes as well as luxury models for which it can command a higher price.
1/11/2006	Kerkorian Aide Tells G.M. to Be More Like Nissan	Ten years ago, Jerome B. York came to Detroit on Kirk Kerkorian's behalf to deliver marching orders to Chrysler. On Tuesday, General Motors' turnaround efforts became the subject of Mr. York's attention. As G.M.'s past and present chief financial officers looked on, Mr. York said G.M. needed to cut its dividend in half; reduce the pay of directors, top managers, salaried staff members and hourly workers; issue clear and specific financial goals; and operate as if its survival were at stake.
1/8/2006	Is There a Future In Ford's Future?	MARK FIELDS has no time to waste -- and no time to become acquainted with employees at Ford Motor, where he is the new president of its American operations. That is why Mr. Fields, who recently returned to Ford's headquarters here in October after three promotions that had taken him to Argentina, Japan and England in the last eight years, has been firing off ''Dear Team'' e-mail messages to employees, outlining the steps that he thinks the company needs to take, and serving as host for internal Webcasts.
1/8/2006	Promises, Promises: 10 Years at the Show of Shows	IF it's January, this must be Detroit. For a onetime Michiganian like myself, the annual pilgrimage to the auto show -- invariably held when the skies are grayest -- is a homecoming and a cause for eternal hope. Chances are you'll find me today at Cobo Center, drinking in the exuberance of an industry that puts on a smiley face even when the numbers wear a frown. This will be the 11th Detroit show I've attended as an out-of-towner. I've learned that auto-show math is fuzzy (most every company predicts impossible sales increases); that crystal balls need better technology (100 m.p.g. cars are never far away; in 1998, General Motors said it would have a ''production ready'' fuel cell car by 2004); that to avoid being trampled, you shouldn't stand between foreign journalists and press kits containing a model car salable on eBay; that you can gauge a company's health by checking the size of the shrimp at its cocktail reception. (No shrimp? Sell the stock!)
1/7/2006	G.M. Chief Says Early '06 Could Show Signs of an Upturn	General Motors expects billion-dollar losses at its struggling North American operations to begin to moderate this quarter, as its cost-cutting plan takes effect, G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said Friday. Speaking in a rare interview with a small group of journalists at G.M.'s headquarters here, Mr. Wagoner declined to predict when G.M. would return to profitability in North America.
1/2/2006	Cars Are Talking; Safety Is the Topic	ON a blustery afternoon here at General Motors' proving grounds northwest of Detroit, engineers whipped around the track in a Chevrolet Suburban and a pair of Cadillac CTS sedans, seemingly intent on causing a collision. For a moment, that seemed to be exactly what would happen. The big Suburban, blocking the view of a Cadillac at the head of the pack, suddenly swerved out of its lane to reveal the lead car stopped in the middle of the track. But before the second Cadillac slammed into the rear of the stopped car, the driver was alerted to the danger by a series of vibrations through the seat. At the same moment, the brakes automatically clamped down to slow the car.
1/1/2006	Cheers to Deals That Fizzed (Or Fizzled)	AHEM. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Settle down, please, and take your seats. Welcome to the annual DealBook ''closing dinner,'' celebrating the year in deal making -- the biggest one, I'm happy to say, since 2000. The merger boomlet of 2004 turned into an outright boom last year -- and, yes, thank goodness, bonuses are back. We're here to raise our glasses to the year's new masters of the universe and to roast those who didn't master much.
12/28/2005	Big Labor's Big Secret	AS most Americans are aware, our auto industry is in a crisis. Workers' wages are falling, and hundreds of thousands of jobs are being sent offshore. America's largest parts supplier, Delphi, filed for bankruptcy protection, and General Motors, Delphi's main customer, may too, if a threatened United Auto Workers strike occurs next month. Meanwhile, Ford and its main parts supplier, Visteon, seem to be skidding down the same road.
12/27/2005	Michigan's Job No. 1: Recovery; Looking to Toyota For a Helping Hand	In another era, Jennifer M. Granholm's courtship of Toyota would have been considered heresy for the governor of Michigan, where American automakers and their suppliers fueled the economic engine for decades. But with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company cutting thousands of jobs, closing plants and eliminating benefits for the shrinking number of workers still employed, the governor is vowing to ''go anywhere, do anything'' to find investment for her state.
12/21/2005	Toyota Closes In on G.M.; Signs Point Toward Japanese Maker Being The Top Seller Soon	After reigning atop the global auto industry since the depths of the Depression in the 1930's, General Motors may finally cede its spot next year to Toyota. The Japanese company's ascendancy underscores the enormous obstacles faced by G.M. on many fronts. On Tuesday, Toyota announced from its offices in Nagoya, Japan, that it planned to produce 9.06 million cars worldwide in 2006. That would be a 10 percent increase for the company, which has plants on every major continent.
12/18/2005	New World Economy	In recent weeks, looking toward next year's midterm elections, leaders of both parties have engaged in highly charged arguments about withdrawal from Iraq, Medicaid shortfalls and allegations of Republican corruption. Anyone bothering to peruse the rest of the front page, however, might have noticed a few items that seemed tangentially related, but that, together, tell a story that is far more consequential for the next 50 years of American life. First, just before Thanksgiving, General Motors, buckling under the weight of $2 billion in losses, announced that it now planned to lay off 30,000 workers and scale back or close a dozen plants. A few days later, at the traditional commencement of the holiday season, thousands of American consumers began lining up in the dark hours of morning to be among the first to pile into Wal-Mart, hoping to re-emerge with discounted laptops and Xboxes under their arms. Wal-Mart has now inherited G.M.'s mantle as the largest employer in the United States, which is why these snapshots of two corporations, taken in a single week, say more about America's economic trajectory than any truckload of spreadsheets ever could.
12/18/2005	In G.M.'s Sight Lines: Washington and Tokyo	RICK WAGONER, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, has announced plans to cut 30,000 jobs and to close several factories in an effort to stem the company's losses. He says he is leading the company through this crisis by concentrating on a handful of priorities and communicating the right messages to multiple constituencies. Here are excerpts from an interview: Q. What's it like to be in the eye of such a big storm? A. I'd rather not be in the financial position that we're in, but I would use an analogy from when I played sports growing up. Is it more fun to play in a game that you won by 40 points or to play in one that your backs were against the wall and you really had to use all of your capabilities and assets and your teammates' capabilities and get the game moving in the right direction? The latter is clearly more satisfying when you get it done. Q. Can you sleep at night? A. I probably have had less sleep this year than I normally have, but when I do, I sleep just fine. Q. What's the psychology at G.M.? A. Our people understand this is one of those few defining moments in the history of our enterprise. I think our people around the world, and particularly here in the United States, see this is a time of great change. Q. How are you making people do their jobs differently? A. We have historically run the business locally, then nationally, then regionally. Now, it's becoming a global business. So we need to kind of rejigger the way we run the enterprise. We made some big moves this year to run product development globally and run manufacturing globally and purchasing globally, and so I get on the Web chat and talk to people in India, engineers in India and Europe and Brazil, and they're saying, ''Gee, we're changing the way we develop products because we're leveraging global resources.'' Q. Were your problems caused by internal decisions, or external forces? A. Well, it's obviously a combination of both. I think it would be disingenuous for us to point to things like U.S. health care policy or trade policy and the exchange rates, things like that, and say they are the whole cause of the problem. The flip side, though, is that anybody who says they are not part of the problem just doesn't have their feet placed in reality. Like it or not, if we pay $1,500 per car for health care and our cheap global competitors pay $200, that's a disadvantage. And we don't have that situation because we're stupid -- it's been the U.S. government policy for us to pay that bill and we've been doing it. Q. What should the government do? A. I don't understand why the U.S. government isn't more proactive on health care. Regardless of whether one believes in sort of the individual-responsibility model or single-payer system, there's a lot of things that can be done to get the cost of health care and the quality of health care moving in the right direction. I think this is an area where strong leadership from the government could play a key role. Information technology is one possibility. Another is leveraging the buying power of the government, which is the biggest purchaser of health care under Medicare and things of that sort. Q. Could the government action fix G.M.'s problems? A. Those steps don't fix G.M.'s ills today. We have things we need to do, and we are taking tough medicine. Q. Some people say you can't fix G.M. so you want a bailout. A. Right. That's for people who don't like to read more than the first line or the headline of a story. Any thoughtful person who looks at the facts would recognize that it is possible to talk about both. The company needs to improve, and we will take the necessary actions. But if one looks at the fact that we're in a global economy and people can move work in jobs to different environments and the flow of trade is more open, the U.S. government has a responsibility to make sure that we have policies which enable us to compete on that global scale. If we don't have those policies, individual companies, one by one, will make decisions that will move those jobs elsewhere. Q. What do you mean when you say that you would like to have a level playing field from Washington? A. The issue that has been particularly grating to us has been the long-term policy of allowing the Japanese government to manipulate the yen valuation to provide export advantages. Japanese manufacturers are very competitive on a global basis. They do not need currency manipulation to protect them. That policy has been followed for 20 to 30 years, and it continues to be followed. It seems the U.S. government should be cracking the whip on them. Everybody's running around excited about China. It's fair that we should have the right kind of exchange-rate policy out of China. But it all starts with Japan. Start with the global trade balances of the countries. Japan has a massive positive trade balance. This is a fully developed country with the second-largest economy in the world, and they have a massive positive trade balance. That's relatively unusual, and a huge amount of that trade balance is in one area: vehicles. China has a huge surplus with the U.S. but it is basically in balance with the world. Q. Would changing the value of the yen have any impact on Japanese ''transplant'' factories that manufacture in the United States? A. Massive. They have huge imported content. Don't forget that out of total transplant sales, a significant percentage, if not a majority, are exported into the U.S. If you look at their financial results, they acknowledge that a one-yen move against the dollar moves their financial results hundreds of millions of dollars. Q. Are you saying that Washington is focused on the wrong target because Japanese competition is more important? A. There are no Chinese automotive sales in the U.S. at this point. What degree of difference is there between China and Japan? It's a million to zero. Q. What advice do you have for chief executives who find themselves in turnaround or recovery situations? A. First of all, it's critically important to focus on the few key factors that drive the turnaround. So you have to know what those are, and I think most C.E.O.'s know what the key factors are. But when times get tough, stay focused on moving those, even if they're the hard things to move. Second of all, do what's right for the business. That sounds obvious, but sometimes there are pressures to make big announcements about things that really aren't necessarily getting at the core problems. So you really need to stay focused and do what's right for the business, short and long term, and that means making tough calls but make the tough calls in the right areas. The third area is the importance of effective communications. I stress ''effective'' because you can overcommunicate and you can undercommunicate and you can communicate the right messages and the wrong messages, particularly within the company. People are always hungrier for information when times are challenging. The importance of communicating with key constituencies -- in our case our dealers, unions and suppliers -- would be good examples. Certainly I've communicated a lot more with our board of directors this year. So I think effective communications is real important when you're going through tough times.
12/13/2005	S.& P. Cuts G.M. Rating To Lowest in 52 Years	Standard & Poor's Ratings Services cut its rating on General Motors' debt two more notches into junk status on Monday, putting the automaker at the lowest level in the 52 years that S.& P. has been assessing its creditworthiness. And if G.M.'s financial position continues to deteriorate, Scott Sprinzen, an automobile analyst for Standard & Poor's, said, it is ''not far-fetched'' that G.M. may ultimately be forced to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure its debt and its labor contracts.
12/9/2005	Car Plants as Chips in Big-Stakes Game	A high-stakes game of poker is under way in the automobile industry, and Chuck Buchanan is one of the chips. Ford's big luxury-car plant here, where Mr. Buchanan has worked for 32 years, is rumored to be on a list of plants that Ford may close under its second restructuring plan in the last four years.
12/8/2005	Investor And G.M. Hold Talks	General Motors said Wednesday that it was holding discussions with the investment firm run by its biggest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, about board representation for his company. It is not clear how many seats Mr. Kerkorian's company, the Tracinda Corporation, is seeking. But one most likely would go to Jerome B. York, 67, a longtime adviser to Mr. Kerkorian and a former chief financial officer of the Chrysler Corporation.
12/7/2005	Finance Chief Is Out at G.M.; His Successor Led in Europe	General Motors, which is battling to reverse losses in North America and energize its sagging market share, replaced its chief financial officer on Tuesday with a longtime company executive who has experience in cost-cutting. G.M. said Frederick A. Henderson, 47, the chairman of G.M. Europe, would take over for John M. Devine, a former Ford Motor Company executive who joined G.M. in 2001.
12/6/2005	G.M.A.C. Sells Auto Loans To Unit of Canadian Bank	The finance unit of General Motors said yesterday that it had agreed to sell as much as $20 billion in auto loans over five years to the corporate and investment banking unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia. The deal is occurring as G.M. seeks cheaper sources of financing after its debt rating was cut to junk status. The bank will initially buy $3 billion in loans from the General Motors Acceptance Corporation this month. G.M.A.C. will manage the loans sold to Bank of Nova Scotia, which is based in Toronto and is Canada's third-largest bank by assets. The companies said the agreement was part of a $6 billion revolving arrangement.
12/4/2005	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Chevrolet Impala LT; Teaching an Old Antelope to Jump Through New Hoops	WITH the redesign of its Impala family sedan, Chevrolet claims to have revamped its entire line of passenger cars. Still, the Impala could be forgiven for having a hand-me-down complex. Beyond the recycled nameplate, which made the first of its several appearances on 1958 models, the 2006 Impala is a mix of old and new. While other recent Chevys like the Cobalt and Malibu got fresh starts, the Impala inherited mechanical underpinnings from the previous model, though these have mostly been massaged and improved.
12/4/2005	Engines Go Back to the Future	GERMAN automakers gave up pushrod engines long ago, in favor of more complex overhead-cam power plants. The Japanese have essentially quit making the old-design engines. Ford is down to just a couple. But Chrysler, with seven, and especially General Motors, with about a dozen in 21 different forms, remain bastions of the pushrod engine, also known as an overhead-valve design.
12/2/2005	Lofty Promise of Saturn Plant Runs Into G.M.'s Fiscal Reality	This was the factory that was going to revive the American automobile industry, proving that Detroit could build quality cars and win back buyers who had defected to the Japanese. Opened when auto companies were closing plants and cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs, General Motors' Saturn plant here was a rare opportunity for the company and its workers to literally leave the industry's old ways behind and embrace some of the lessons that Japan was teaching, with an American twist.
11/29/2005	G.M. Temporarily Waives Cuts in Prices It Pays Delphi	General Motors said on Monday that it would give the Delphi Corporation some temporary financial assistance while talks continued on a rescue plan. And Delphi said it was giving the United Automobile Workers union more time to negotiate before the company files a motion in bankruptcy court asking for permission to terminate its labor agreements.
11/28/2005	Age of Anxiety	Many eulogies were published following the recent death of Peter Drucker, the great management theorist. I was surprised, however, that few of these eulogies mentioned his book ''The Age of Discontinuity,'' a prophetic work that speaks directly to today's business headlines and economic anxieties. Mr. Drucker wrote ''The Age of Discontinuity'' in the late 1960's, a time when most people assumed that the big corporations of the day, companies like General Motors and U.S. Steel, would dominate the economy for the foreseeable future. He argued that this assumption was all wrong.
11/26/2005	Holiday Cheer? Not So Fast, G.M. Says	WHENEVER consumers seem poised to shake off the gathering gloom over the economy, a new cloud appears. Just as retailers began to hint that the holiday shopping season might be better than anticipated, General Motors expanded the number of jobs it planned to shed and identified specific factories for closing. BIG ENOUGH? -- Buffeted by billion-dollar losses and a shrinking market share, General Motors said it would cut almost a tenth of its worldwide work force and shut all or part of a dozen factories over three years. Seven of the plants are in the United States or Canada.
11/25/2005	Bad For the Country	''What was good for our country,'' a former president of General Motors once declared, ''was good for General Motors, and vice versa.'' G.M., which has been losing billions, has announced that it will eliminate 30,000 jobs. Is what's bad for General Motors bad for America? In this case, yes.
11/24/2005	A German Auto Supplier Delphi Might Envy	When Manfred Wennemer talks about the American auto industry these days, he sounds like a driver thankful to have survived a nasty pileup with a few scratches. His German auto parts maker, Continental, has avoided most of the jolts that have rattled its American counterparts. While Delphi and its biggest customer, General Motors, are struggling to stave off financial problems, Continental's profits are surging and its stock is hitting record highs.
11/23/2005	Delphi Chief Fights Battle Of Detroit	Robert S. Miller started off as the Oracle of Delphi, handing down dire pronouncements about the auto industry from his lofty post as chief executive of the parts supplier. But with the Delphi Corporation in bankruptcy proceedings, Mr. Miller, known as Steve, has come charging down from the mountaintop to confront Delphi's unions in a way that Detroit has rarely seen.
11/22/2005	Mix of Shock and Resignation on G.M. Shop Floors Set to Close	When Dan Fairbanks received word from General Motors early Monday morning that his plant had been tagged for closing next year, there were few people in the factory to tell. About two-thirds of the 300 hourly employees at the Lansing Craft Center, where Mr. Fairbanks is the president of a local chapter of the United Automobile Workers, are temporarily laid off. In fact, they have not worked for most of the year. The Lansing Craft Center is still scheduled to ratchet up production early next month but will close for good sometime next year.
11/22/2005	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Saturday about a family with four generations of General Motors workers referred incorrectly in some editions to a statement by Rick Wagoner, General Motors' chief executive, on the possibility of a bankruptcy filing by the company. Mr. Wagoner said recently that the company had no plans to file for bankruptcy, not that it did intend to do so.
11/22/2005	G.M. SET TO DROP 5,000 MORE JOBS AND SHUT PLANTS	General Motors, the world's largest auto company, announced details on Monday of a three-year blueprint to revive its fortunes, including 5,000 job cuts on top of 25,000 previously announced. Analysts immediately questioned whether the plan was enough, saying it lacked the speed and breadth that had helped rivals make comebacks. Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said the jobs cuts along with plant closings were ''necessary for G.M. to get its costs in line with our major global competitors.''
11/19/2005	For a G.M. Family, the American Dream Vanishes	Four generations of the Roy family relied on General Motors for their prosperity. Over more than seven decades, the company's wages bought the Roys homes, cars and once-unimaginable comforts, while G.M.'s enviable medical and pension benefits have kept them secure in their retirements.
11/19/2005	Nissan's Mr. Fix-It Is the Talk of Detroit	Carlos Ghosn, one of the world's smoothest car pitchmen, skipped a beat. ''That is very flattering,'' he said Thursday night, stalling for time after learning that auto analysts in Detroit told reporters this week that he, the man who turned around the Nissan Motor Company, would be the dream manager to turn around General Motors. ''It is better to be cited this way than the other way around, that this is a guy you need to avoid.''
11/18/2005	Buick Shifts From 'Dream' to 'Precision'	THE struggling Buick division of General Motors is changing campaigns for the second time in little more than a year. Advertising that since fall 2004 had carried the theme ''Dream up,'' featuring the Aerosmith song ''Dream On'' -- up, on, who can keep track? -- is being discarded in favor of a campaign proclaiming that Buick offers cars built of a quality so exacting it is ''Beyond precision.''
11/14/2005	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Thursday about a restatement of 2001 earnings by General Motors misstated the company's net income for that year. It was $601 million. (The $1.2 billion figure represented income from continuing operations after G.M. recalculated 2001 results to reflect the sale of Hughes Electronics in 2003.)
11/12/2005	Adjustments, Shifts, Corrections and a Revision	THIS was a week for major course corrections, in mergers, in markets, in media and in the financial statements of the granddaddy of industrial companies, General Motors. DEAL BREAKER -- The Guidant Corporation, the nation's second-largest maker of implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, sued its erstwhile suitor, Johnson & Johnson, to make it follow through on its offer to buy Guidant for $25.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson got cold feet after learning that some Guidant products tended to short-circuit and might have contributed to patient deaths.
11/10/2005	G.M. Lowers 2001 Profit; Error Cited	General Motors said on Wednesday that it overstated its 2001 results by as much as $400 million, or 35 percent, and said that it might have to restate results for the following years as well. The company said a review of its supplier payments for the years 2000 through 2005 concluded that it erroneously credited some payments to its results for 2001, instead of recording the payments for later years.
11/7/2005	Pride, Prejudice, Insurance	General Motors is reducing retirees' medical benefits. Delphi has declared bankruptcy, and will probably reduce workers' benefits as well as their wages. An internal Wal-Mart memo describes plans to cut health costs by hiring temporary workers, who aren't entitled to health insurance, and screening out employees likely to have high medical bills. These aren't isolated anecdotes. Employment-based health insurance is the only serious source of coverage for Americans too young to receive Medicare and insufficiently destitute to receive Medicaid, but it's an institution in decline. Between 2000 and 2004 the number of Americans under 65 rose by 10 million. Yet the number of nonelderly Americans covered by employment-based insurance fell by 4.9 million.
11/4/2005	At Tokyo Auto Show, a Focus on Fuel, Not Fenders	From Mazda's car that promises to use hydrogen to run a rotary engine to a General Motors sports utility vehicle powered by fuel cells, carmakers are competing at the Tokyo Motor Show to send car buyers a message: They have learned the lessons of the Prius. But while Toyota has clearly hit a car industry nerve with the Prius, its gasoline-electric hybrid, Toyota's influence goes only so far. As one automaker after another made clear at the auto show, which runs through Nov. 6, Toyota is not setting a universal standard for new technologies. It may be setting the pace, but mostly what it has shown is that high gasoline prices have made buyers more open-minded to alternatives.
11/4/2005	THE CHURN	Deal Makers Goldman Sachs and Citigroup advised Telefnica of Spain on its $31.5 billion deal for O2 of Britain. J. P. Morgan Cazenove and Merrill Lynch advised O2. RBC Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch are advising Barrick Gold of Canada on its unsolicited $9.2 billion offer for Placer Dome. Barrick's legal advisers are Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg in Canada and Cravath, Swaine & Moore in the United States. People Nancy Everett, the chief investment officer of General Motors Asset Management, will become president and chief executive on Jan. 1. The current chief executive, Allen Reed, will assume the new position of chairman and will retire early next year.
11/2/2005	Big Drop In October For Detroit	October, which is the start of the new model year, used to be a month for the auto industry to celebrate. This year, it was a month for Detroit to forget. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler held their lowest shares of the American market ever last month. Sales fell in the wake of high gasoline prices, fears about the economy and consumer resistance to buying cars without the big discounts the companies offered this summer.
10/28/2005	Judging Pension Plan by a Percentage Choice	The investigation of General Motors' pension accounting, which the automaker disclosed on Wednesday, appears to be focused on whether G.M. has the data to justify the numbers it has reported to investors -- something securities regulators have long been warning companies they would have to provide if challenged. In broad terms, the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to know whether G.M. has accurately measured the value of the benefits it is to pay its workers after they retire.
10/27/2005	Inquiry Into G.M. Accounts By S.E.C.	The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating General Motors' accounting in ''various matters,'' the automaker disclosed yesterday, including its handling of pensions and some transactions between G.M. and Delphi, the supply giant that was once a division of G.M. Taken together, the investigations, which include the issuing of subpoenas, appear to be looking at whether G.M. has understated debt or inflated income.
10/26/2005	DaimlerChrysler Profit Falls; Sales Improve in 2 Divisions	DaimlerChrysler reported on Tuesday that its third-quarter profit dropped by more than one-fifth even as business steadily improved at both its Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz divisions. The automaker, which is based in Stuttgart, Germany, attributed its weakened performance to increased income tax expenses. In the third quarter last year, its net income grew because of a one-time tax-exempt sale of its stake in Hyundai, the Korean automaker. Without that cash cushion this year, Daimler's earnings fell 21 percent, to $910 million, or 755 million euros.
10/26/2005	ODDS AND ENDS: Picnicking, Defogging and Making Fuel Go Further; Leave the Scraper in the Trunk	WITH the leaves already changing, it won't be long before many people find themselves scraping snow and ice off the windshield on wintry mornings. With that in mind, no doubt, General Motors has introduced two car models for 2006 -- the Cadillac DTS and Buick Lucerne -- that will come equipped with heated windshield fluid that clears and de-ices the glass.
10/25/2005	World Business Briefing | Europe: Russia: G.M. to Use Arms Scientists in Auto Research	General Motors is turning to scientists who once designed nuclear bombs and biological weapons in the Soviet Union to invent new car technology. G.M. is to announce today a science center in Russia that is part of an effort to cut the cost of engineering cars and trucks. G.M., which has been posting quarterly losses, intends to take advantage of American and European programs that pay former Soviet scientists to abandon weapons development for peaceful projects, said Alan Taub, G.M.'s director of research and development. ''We now have researchers working in laboratories which 15 years ago even the C.I.A. couldn't penetrate,'' he said. ''It's a whole new world.''
10/22/2005	Cutbacks, Bankruptcy and Growing Inflation Signs	UNALLOYED good news was in short supply this week. Automakers finally made progress in paring their uncompetitive labor costs, but they still posted huge losses for the last quarter and had little by way of encouragement about their prospects for the future. Sizable layoffs and plant closings are likely early next year, they said, and workers who keep their jobs will have to pay more for their health care. Many big companies said this week that their earnings in the last quarter were better than expected, but many also warned that profits were not likely to grow as fast in the coming months. Inflation, meanwhile, is accelerating, while other economic statistics suggest growth may be slowing.
10/21/2005	One Step for G.M.  	The Cadillac of health care plans is being traded in. The United Automobile Workers on Thursday announced the details of its tentative agreement with General Motors to impose health benefit cuts on union retirees. For the first time, G.M. retirees will have to pay deductibles, monthly premiums and co-payments for services like X-rays.
10/21/2005	Union Offers Details of Health Deal With G.M.	A front-page article on Tuesday about an agreement between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers to curtail health benefits for employees and retirees misstated the scope of planned revisions at another big employer, SBC Communications. (The error also occurred in an article in Business Day the same day about the effect on G.M. retirees.) The changes affect active or retired salaried employees not covered by union contracts -- not those covered by contracts.
10/20/2005	Corrections	At the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota unveiled a futuristic car powered by a gasoline-electric engine that sounded part Jetsons, part Star Trek. With this so-called hybrid engine under the hood, the concept car was called the Prius. Fast forward to Wednesday's opening of the 2005 Motor Show. America's Big Three auto makers -- Ford Motor, General Motors and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler -- were deploying slinky models to drape themselves over concept cars running in some kind of alternative fashion: hydrogen fuel cells or gasoline-electric engines.
10/20/2005	In the Hybrid's Wake, Trying to Catch Up	American corporations have to run leaner and meaner in the global competitive environment. By agreeing to let General Motors trim the well-above-average health benefits it offers, the United Auto Workers negotiators showed that they are willing to be active participants, rather than merely speed bumps, on the road to globalization. We hope that rank-and-file union members approve the deal, trusting that accepting less now may mean more later on. The compromise will save G.M. $1 billion annually in health costs for workers, retirees and their families -- money the company desperately needs, having lost nearly $4 billion in this year alone.
10/19/2005	Back on the Road	When Sam Loggans saw the United Automobile Workers president, Ron Gettelfinger, at an N.A.A.C.P. event last year, he had a message for the union boss. ''I said, 'G.M. is going to come after our benefits,''' recalled Mr. Loggans, who proudly displays a plaque on his living room wall honoring his 30 years as an electrician at General Motors. Mr. Gettelfinger, he said, looked him in the eye and assured him that benefits for retirees ''were not going to be on the table.''
10/18/2005	Health Care Reality Intrudes; G.M. Retirees Confront the Way It Is Now: Co-Pays and Deductibles	General Motors said on Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the United Automobile Workers union to cut $1 billion in annual health care benefits for more than 750,000 blue-collar workers, retirees and their families as part of an effort to climb out of a financial crisis. ''This is a very big step forward that we will build on,'' said Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. He called it ''the single biggest cost reduction that we've probably been able to announce in a single day in the history of G.M.''
10/17/2005	The Big Squeeze	In 1999 Delphi, the parts division of General Motors, was spun off as an independent company. Now Delphi has filed for bankruptcy. Its chief executive, Robert S. Miller, wants the company's workers to accept drastic wage cuts, from an average hourly wage rate of about $27 to as little as $10 an hour. There are a lot of questions about how Delphi and the auto industry in general reached this point. Why were large severance packages given to Delphi executives even as the company demanded wage cuts? Why, when General Motors was profitable, did it pay big dividends but fail to put in enough money to secure its workers' pensions?
10/14/2005	Union Sees Progress in Talks With G.M.	General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union are making progress on the company's request for contract changes to lower its $5.6 billion annual expense for health care, the U.A.W.'s president, Ronald Gettelfinger, said yesterday. ''We are holding very constructive talks,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said.
10/13/2005	Oil Spreads Wealth in Russia, and Russians Are Spending It on Foreign Cars	Three years ago Hyundai Motor's sales in Russia were as modest as its cars. Who among the new class of superrich would buy a low-profile Hyundai? And who among the poor could afford one? With revenues from Russia's oil exports pulsing through the economy, Hyundai's fortunes have changed profoundly.
10/13/2005	Passing the Bucks	There will be no corporate citizenship awards for the Delphi Corporation, the nation's largest auto parts supplier, which recently filed for bankruptcy. The F.B.I. and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating its accounting practices. It will have to restate years' worth of earnings. And the day before filing for bankruptcy -- as the company asked factory workers to accept cuts lowering their pay by as much as two-thirds, down to as low as $10 an hour -- management fattened severance packages for 21 executives. The chief executive, Robert Miller Jr., decided to calm frayed nerves in America's Rust Belt by suggesting to The Financial Times earlier this week that he feared ''intergenerational warfare'' as young people rebelled against paying for their grandparents' retirement. But the only war being waged is a public relations war, with Mr. Miller using scare tactics to get the United Auto Workers to agree to drastic wage cuts, to get General Motors to promise his company steady business and, most likely, to ease the way toward dumping Delphi's pensions.
10/12/2005	G.M. to Cut $1 Billion in Costs By Revamping Some Operations	General Motors plans to cut costs by $1 billion on revamped midsize cars by streamlining engineering and production, and it may build more vehicles outside the United States, Robert A. Lutz, the company's vice chairman, said yesterday. The cost savings that Mr. Lutz discussed would be from a group of nine midsize vehicles, including the Chevrolet Malibu, that G.M. plans to introduce starting in 2007.
10/11/2005	For Big Three, All the Signs Are Warnings; Echoes of Chrysler Bid as Kerkorian Squeezes G.M.	Jerome B. York is looking over Rick Wagoner's shoulder, and that should make Mr. Wagoner nervous. Mr. York, 66, is the point man for Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire financier who in the last few months has become one of the largest shareholders in General Motors; Mr. Wagoner is G.M.'s chairman and chief executive.
10/11/2005	For Big Three, All the Signs Are Warnings; As Delphi Goes, So Goes G.M.?	Watch out Detroit, you could be next. That is the warning for domestic automakers from Robert S. Miller Jr., the straight-talking chief executive of Delphi, who took his company, the nation's biggest maker of auto parts, into bankruptcy protection last weekend.
10/10/2005	With Delphi Filing, Tougher Times for Auto Industry Workers	When Delphi, the nation's largest auto supplier, filed for bankruptcy on Saturday, it was the latest blow to the American auto worker's gilded age. Ninety-one years ago, Henry Ford shocked corporate America by abruptly announcing that he would roughly double his workers' average wages, to $5 a day. For the first time, many Ford line workers could afford the Model T's they were assembling.
10/5/2005	Bankruptcy Seems Near At Delphi	Delphi, the nation's largest supplier of auto parts, is prepared to file for bankruptcy as early as this week, lining up lawyers and consultants in preparation for what would be the domestic auto industry's largest filing in recent times. Whether Robert S. Miller, Delphi's chief executive for three months, actually goes through with it remains to be seen. Mr. Miller has said publicly that he will file for bankruptcy by Oct. 17 at the latest, when bankruptcy laws change, unless General Motors, Delphi's former parent, and the United Automobile Workers union agree to what would be a multibillion-dollar bailout. The parties have been conducting discussions for months.
10/5/2005	Running on Empty	For years critics have been saying that a reliance on gas-guzzling but profitable sport-utility vehicles could not keep American car manufacturers afloat forever. On Monday, sales figures for the month of September came out, suggesting that the day of reckoning may be at hand. Large S.U.V. sales were down 43 percent last month from a year earlier. Automakers, of course, pointed a finger at Hurricane Katrina's effect on gas prices. But the explanation is really larger -- a total failure of long-term planning. Toyota's strategists and engineers had no idea what the 2005 weather would bring when they started working on a ''21st century vehicle'' in 1994. But they certainly realized that a more fuel-efficient car might be one way to succeed in a competitive market. They dedicated the resources and rolled out their first hybrid in 1997. The company spent a reported $800 million developing the Prius, ending up with roughly 650 patents on the technology. It took a little while to catch on, but Toyota nurtured and improved its product until the moment came when the new idea would finally take off. The moment has come. Prius sales were up 90 percent in September.
10/4/2005	Big S.U.V.'s Lag in Sales, Hindered By Gas Cost	The heyday of the giant sport utility vehicle keeps moving farther away as gasoline prices loom larger. In September, industrywide sales of large S.U.V.'s were down 43 percent from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. That is particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which are dependent on truck-based S.U.V.'s.
10/3/2005	G.M. and a U.S. Agency See Pensions in Different Lights	The federal government contends that General Motors' pension fund is $31 billion short of what it owes its work force, according to closely held government data, a figure in stark contrast to G.M.'s assurances that its pension plans are ''fully funded.'' The government's finding of a huge imbalance suggests that the pension fund may have much larger claims on the company than G.M.'s financial filings have indicated. It was calculated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency whose job it is to insure employee pensions if a company fails to meet its obligations.
9/28/2005	G.M. and Canadian Union Reach a Deal	General Motors of Canada and the Canadian Auto Workers reached a three-year contract late Tuesday, narrowly avoiding a strike. The last-minute scramble produced a tentative deal offering only modest wage and benefit increases, in contrast to expectations earlier in the day.
9/21/2005	G.M. to Stress Fuel Efficiency in Promoting Its Next S.U.V. Line	General Motors plans to market its next generation of large sport utility vehicles by promoting their gas mileage. Talking about fuel economy in commercials for vehicles like the Chevrolet Suburban might seem counterintuitive, particularly since large S.U.V.'s get mileage in the teens at a time when Americans have become more sensitive to what it costs to fill up.
9/8/2005	Three Automakers Plan Alliance to Develop a Hybrid Car	BMW, the world's largest luxury carmaker, will join General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to develop fuel-saving gasoline-electric power systems to try to catch up with the hybrid leader, Toyota. BMW intends to have an agreement with G.M. and DaimlerChrysler later this year, the companies said yesterday. G.M. and DaimlerChrysler said in December that they would develop hybrids to offer better fuel economy and create fewer emissions than conventional gasoline engines. They signed a deal on Aug. 22.
9/7/2005	Toyota Hopes to Push Its Hybrids Beyond the Niche	With Hurricane Katrina pushing American gas prices above $3 a gallon at the pump, Toyota Motor may find itself in the right place at the right time, with a new, half-mile assembly line capable of producing gasoline-electric hybrid Prius cars at the rate of one a minute. The line, in a factory in Toyota City, is part of a strategy by Japan's largest company to expand hybrids from a niche in the marketplace (just 5 percent of its American sales now) to mainstream (25 percent of its sales by 2010).
9/5/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; Next Up, Crossover Convertible Coupes	MY country cousins used to keep pets of every description, from beetles to burros, on their farm in North Carolina. Their mother tolerated all of these creatures -- except for an opossum. ''But it's a marsupial,'' the youngsters insisted, implying that the creature held some educational value, always a winning argument with adults.
9/2/2005	Automakers, Briefly Rich in Sales, Looking at a Dry Spell	The brief sales honeymoon for the domestic automakers appears to be over. General Motors reported yesterday that sales had dropped sharply in August, and the industry reported weakness across the board in sales of the large sport utility vehicles that the domestic automakers, in particular, have depended on.
9/1/2005	On Auto Dealer Lots, a Shift Away From Gas-Guzzling Vehicles	Michelle Rable was in the middle of car shopping on Wednesday morning when she stopped to fill up her Pontiac Aztec, a sport utility vehicle, with gas -- at $3.09 a gallon. That was enough to get Ms. Rable, a registrar at a local college, to spend her lunchtime test-driving the hybrid gas-electric Prius at a Toyota dealership. She was all but sold.
8/31/2005	G.M. Reports Progress in Returning to Profitability but Also Sees Problems	General Motors executives told financial analysts yesterday that they were making progress in their efforts to become profitable again, but that rising gas prices and continuing negotiations over labor costs were complicating the company's comeback bid. The executives said that sales of G.M.'s large sport utility vehicles, which have been a crucial profit center, will not return to their past levels. The company is also shifting its view on gas prices. After saying for months that rising prices were not a factor in softening demand for such vehicles, they now say the prices are having an effect.
8/26/2005	Williams And Jackson Omitted From Latino Ballots	When Major League Baseball unveiled its ballot for the Latino Legends team Tuesday, the 60 nominees excluded two of the greatest Hispanic players ever: Ted Williams and Reggie Jackson. Williams and Jackson's names seem out of place in a group with Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda, Pedro Martnez and Rod Carew, but Williams's mother was Mexican and Jackson's father was half Puerto Rican and played in the Negro leagues.
8/26/2005	Discounts Extended At G.M.	The 2006 models of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks by General Motors have barely hit the market, but the company said yesterday that it would start using employee discount offers to ensure that they sell. Some analysts saw the move as the latest sign that America's appetite for gas guzzlers, like G.M.'s Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade, is beginning to wane as fuel prices rise. The move was also something of a reversal for G.M., which has suggested in the past that employee discounts will largely be used to clear out its 2005 models, while 2006 models will be shifted to a new strategy using lower sticker prices.
8/19/2005	Wall St. Agrees G.M. Is Troubled but Not Bound for Bankruptcy Soon	With its offer of employee discounts to the public, General Motors addressed its short-term woes: it had two months of robust sales and cleared out its bloated inventory. But the fire sale did not solve G.M.'s fundamental problems, which raises the question of whether this former bulwark of American industry faces the prospect of bankruptcy.
8/16/2005	Fuel Economy Plan Is Seen Omitting Rule for Big S.U.V.'s	The Bush administration is expected to abandon a proposal to extend fuel economy regulations to include Hummer H2's and other huge sport utility vehicles, auto industry and other officials say. The proposal was among a number of potential strategies outlined by the administration in 2003 to overhaul mileage requirements for light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans. It had been seen by industry officials as likely to be adopted.
8/10/2005	Butts in the Street? The Least of Their Problems	Asking smokers not to flick their cigarette butts into the street or crush them on sidewalks would seem a perfectly reasonable step toward beautifying a city, an extension of the broken-windows theory that keeping up with the little things can keep a place clean and safe. Except that here, not only are the windows broken, but the buildings are abandoned and falling apart, and some parks are so overgrown that people have been known to dump their dead dogs in the tall weeds.
8/9/2005	A Supplier Of Parts Seeks Help From G.M.	The chief executive of Delphi, the big auto parts supplier, said Monday that it might seek bankruptcy protection if it did not considerably reduce its labor costs, a development that could have severe consequences for the industry and its workers. In blunt remarks, Delphi's chief executive, Robert S. Miller, aimed his comments at the United Automobile Workers, the company's largest labor union, and General Motors, its former parent.
8/9/2005	G.M. Thrives in China With Small, Thrifty Vans	In this obscure corner of southern China, General Motors seems to have hit on a hot new formula: $5,000 minivans that get 43 miles to the gallon in city driving. That combination of advantages has captivated Chinese buyers, propelling G.M. into the leading spot in this nascent car market. Compact and utilitarian, these vehicles, called Wuling Sunshine minivans, hardly fit the big-is-better image of G.M., known in the United States for producing some of the largest gas guzzlers on the market, like Hummers.
8/4/2005	G.M. to Sell Majority Stake In One of Its Mortgage Units	General Motors said yesterday that it would sell a majority stake in its commercial mortgage business, part of a continuing effort to shield G.M.'s financial division after downgrades of the company's debt to junk bond ratings. G.M. will sell a 60 percent stake in the business to an investor group that included Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, Five Mile Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. The commercial mortgage business is one piece of G.M.'s vast financing division, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which in recent years has been far more profitable than G.M.'s automotive division. But G.M. has been overhauling G.M.A.C. in light of G.M.'s new junk bond rating, which has limited the division's options for raising cash.
8/3/2005	G.M. Ads Return to a Newspaper	An advertisement for the Pontiac Solstice in the Monday edition of The Los Angeles Times was more than just another car ad. It also represented the return of General Motors to the newspaper after more than three months of refusing to advertise in its pages. G.M.'s absence shortly followed a column by the Pulitzer Prize winning car critic Dan Neil in April, in which he called for the dismissal of G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner. ''When ball clubs have losing records, players and coaches and managers get their walking papers,'' Mr. Neil wrote. ''At G.M., it's time to sweep the dugout.'' In a statement, Brian Akre, a company spokesman, said: ''G.M. and The Los Angeles Times have had productive discussions regarding our complaints about the newspaper's coverage of G.M. While we have respectfully agreed to disagree on some of the issues, we sincerely believe The Times has a better understanding of our concerns and we appreciate its ongoing willingness to listen.''
8/2/2005	2 Carmakers Trim Prices, But Rebates May Shrink	General Motors and Ford may be slowly backing away from a longstanding Detroit practice: inflating the price tags on cars and then offering big rebates to sweeten the deal. In the latest escalation of the price war among the Big Three American automakers, G.M. and Ford said Monday that they would cut the sticker prices on a few dozen of their new cars and trucks, in some cases by thousands of dollars. That could mean smaller and fewer discounts and other incentives that consumers have grown to expect when they buy an American car.
7/27/2005	New Art to a Deal At the Car Lot; One Chevrolet Showroom Courts Hispanics in Effort to Survive	At ''Z'' Frank Chevrolet, it takes a little more spice to sell a Chevy these days. On a recent Saturday, salsa music blared from a radio near the showroom's entrance. Children watched a movie on Telemundo, the Spanish-language television station. Sales representatives wearing Tommy Bahama shirts conversed in Spanish with potential buyers.
7/27/2005	General Motors to Sell Consumer Auto Loans to Bank of America	General Motors said Tuesday that it would sell up to $55 billion worth of consumer car loans to Bank of America over the next five years. The move follows downgrades in May of G.M.'s debt to a rating of below investment grade, or junk, by Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Those downgrades and rising interest rates have made it more expensive for G.M.'s financing division, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, to use bonds to raise money for car loans. But G.M.A.C., as the financing division is known, does have more palatable options available, like selling off large numbers of car loans in a relatively new kind of transaction known as a whole loan sale.
7/26/2005	A Different Beat: Toyota Raises Prices While Detroit Cuts Deeply	At a time when Detroit's Big Three automakers are offering steeply reduced ''employee discounts'' to nearly everyone who walks in the door, Toyota Motor is doing the opposite: earlier this month, it announced slight price increases on many models sold in the United States. Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, says the increases, which will affect American versions of its popular Camry sedan and some cars in its luxury Lexus lineup, are necessary because of the rising costs of steel and other raw materials.
7/25/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; 50 Candles for a Breakthrough Chevy	EVERYTHING in Detroit seemed to change for 1955, as if the entire auto industry awoke at once and shook off the last remaining traces of its cautious postwar mind-set. In a short span, car designs transformed from the complex multiple curves drawn in the 1940's to clean, modern sweeps of sheet metal that reflected a new era of American optimism. With the economy booming, a horsepower war that would last more than a decade began to escalate, and even the cars' electrical systems joined the revolt against the status quo.
7/25/2005	A New Worry for Investors: Retirees' Medical Benefits	As double-digit inflation in health care siphons more and more cash from old-line companies with generous benefits, big investors are growing wary. ''Rapidly rising health care costs depress the returns of our pension fund,'' said George Diehr, a health benefits official at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, with more than $180 billion in assets.
7/25/2005	From Iron to Gold: A Stellar V-8	IF there were lifetime achievement awards for automotive engines, the Chevrolet small-block V-8 would be a sure winner. While such awards are sometimes no more than acknowledgments of longevity -- for an actor at the end of a long career, perhaps -- the best years of the Chevy V-8 seem to still lie ahead. Though it has turned 50, it is at the peak of its form: a version developed for the 2006 Corvette Z06, at 427 cubic inches and 505 horsepower, will be the biggest and most powerful of the 90 million small-blocks Chevrolet has built so far.
7/24/2005	The Green Machine That Could Be Detroit	IMAGINE that you are running a domestic automaker. Rising gasoline prices threaten your lucrative S.U.V. sales, a glut of car-making capacity promises ever more competition, and burdensome union contracts limit your ability to cut costs. Then there are the Chinese. They're beginning to put together the parts they've been making for years, and sooner rather than later, whole cars from China will arrive at scarily low prices. What do you do? The easy answer is to follow the path that Detroit has taken for years. Grind out well-made but ho-hum vehicles and offer them at huge discounts. Let your debt rating fall below investment grade. And when California tries to impose mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases, you sue, even if some other states want the same stricter standards -- and even if some consumers are lining up to pay hefty premiums for energy-saving hybrid vehicles that run on both gasoline and electricity.
7/22/2005	What's Under Tribeca's Hood? Yes, the Battery	BID farewell to Park Avenue -- it's so last decade -- and say hi to TriBeCa, the embodiment of the urban, the sophisticated and the hip. Those last words are borrowed. More on that in a moment. In case you were wondering, we are not referring here to New York neighborhoods. This is car talk.
7/21/2005	Despite a June Surge in Sales, G.M. Posts Another Losing Quarter	General Motors reported its third consecutive losing quarter on Wednesday as surging sales in June did not translate into profits. Many of G.M.'s domestic problems were laid bare in the second quarter, from its reliance on large sport utility vehicles to its enormous health care costs, leading two of the three major credit ratings agencies to downgrade G.M.'s debt below investment grade in May to junk bond status.
7/19/2005	Iacocca, Away From the Grind, Still Has a Lot to Say	Lee A. Iacocca is back and still shooting from the hip. After remaining silent during Detroit's recent doldrums, Mr. Iacocca, the 80-year-old former Chrysler chairman, is talking about cars again and even promoting Chrysler's cars in three new commercials. In an interview on Monday, the man who once pulled Chrysler from the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1980's offered his views on the domestic industry and its weakest giant, General Motors.
7/19/2005	G.M. Hires an Adviser for Try at Comeback	General Motors, the world's largest automaker, has hired the prominent automobile business analyst Stephen Girsky from Morgan Stanley to help guide its efforts to return to profitability. Mr. Girsky, 43, will join G.M. on Aug. 1, the automaker said yesterday. He will advise the chief executive, Rick Wagoner, and the chief financial officer, John M. Devine.
7/17/2005	Brave New Faces for G.M.'s Also-Ran Vans	UNDERACHIEVEMENT is frustrating to everyone concerned, or so I was told during my college career. The underachiever cannot understand why others are dissatisfied with his performance, while authority figures puzzle over the slacker's failure to fulfill his potential. While General Motors has produced all manner of underachieving cars and trucks over the years, its lackluster minivans have stood out -- or perhaps it is more accurate to say these efforts have not stood out. From the slant-nose ''Dustbusters'' of the early 1990's to the conventional boxes that made their debut as 1997 models, G.M.'s vans barely made a ripple or raised an eyebrow in the soccer field parking lots of suburbia.
7/10/2005	And Now, a Word From the Streets	The underground street-art scene usually maintains an antagonistic equilibrium: graffiti artists bomb (i.e., paint) highly visible sites; civic groups buff (i.e., paint over) their handiwork. But new graffiti-style advertisements -- done, it must be said, by real-live graffiti artists -- for decidedly above-ground companies like Time Warner, General Motors and Unilever have lately upset that balance. Now it's angry artists who are protesting and even buffing, and marketing experts who are joining in on heated debates about selling out. For the advertisers, of course, (almost) any publicity is welcome. Reports from three new battlegrounds: HUMMER H3: Shortly after the Tats Cru's murals for this General Motors vehicle began appearing on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the advertising blog adrants.com reported that one had been overwritten with protests like, ''No blood for oil.'' A commenter on the site asked just how authentic street art was ''if it says 'street art' on the ad.'' AXE DEODORANT: In late May, a graffiti-style billboard for Axe men's deodorant by Unilever replaced the usual concert fliers on a boarded-up building in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago. Ed Marszewski, who edits an alternative culture magazine, Lumpen, posted a video clip on Lumpen.com showing his ad hoc band of ''Ad Blasters'' painting over the Axe ad while making the deadpan admonition, ''Any kind of corporate graffiti must be eviscerated.'' Mr. Marszewski wrote of the Axe mural, ''It's not 'graffiti' & it's not art -- the power to inspire vaporizes once the viewer realizes they are simply being targeted as a consumer.'' Steve Lambert, on the Brooklyn-based media site Stay Free! (stayfreemagazine.org), argued that those who live by the street art ethos must be prepared to die by it: ''It seems the Axe ad tried to be a part of the community by being at street level, using graffiti artists, etc., but wasn't respected enough in the community to last.'' The editor of Stay Free!, Carrie McLaren, wrote that when it came to the ad's target demographic, Ad Blasters had done Axe a favor: ''By painting over the billboard, they made it more authentic.'' TIME MAGAZINE: Last month Time commissioned the well-known graffiti artist Cope2 (cope2truelegend.com/) to repeatedly bomb a blank billboard at the corner of Houston and Wooster Streets in SoHo. After several weeks, the magazine's distinctive red border was placed over the accumulated tags. In declaring Time's campaign a success, Marc Schiller, who runs Wooster Collective (woostercollective.com), a leading street-art blog, dismissed the advertising vs. art dichotomy altogether: ''Once something's out there,'' he said, ''what matters is how well it's done.'' GREG ALLEN
7/9/2005	For G.M., a Struggling Delphi Could Prove to Be a Burden	As General Motors tries to cut tens of billions in labor costs, it faces the increasing likelihood that it will bear some financial responsibility for its former auto parts subsidiary Delphi, industry experts say. Although the amount G.M. would have to shoulder to help the financially beleaguered Delphi is unknown, many analysts believe that it will not pose a too heavy burden.
7/9/2005	Selling the Sizzle; Can G.M.'s Design Guru Bring Americans Back?	For much of his career, Robert A. Lutz has been trying to build a curvy two-seat sports car for people who can't afford a Porsche or a Lexus. He finally has: the Pontiac Solstice. ''The goal was always the same,'' Mr. Lutz, General Motors' 73-year-old vice chairman and product development chief, said in an interview this week. ''Use low-cost mechanical components, change as little as possible, use stuff out of your parts bin and try to get there for under $20,000.''
7/7/2005	As the Going Gets Tough, Chrysler Calls on Its Old Pitchman	Chrysler is bringing back Lee A. Iacocca to do what he does best -- pitch cars in commercials. At least that is the plan. On Wednesday, Chrysler executives said a deal was being negotiated with Mr. Iacocca, the company's 80-year-old retired chairman, adding that they hoped to have all the details worked out by Thursday. The first of an initial series of three commercials has already been shot. And yes, it will feature Mr. Iacocca's classic line from his commercials of another era -- ''If you can find a better car, buy it'' -- though it will be read by the other star of the first commercial, the actor Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame.
7/6/2005	Ford, Too, Is Offering Employees' Price to All	It is a good time to buy an American car -- or so Detroit's Big Three automakers want consumers to think. On Tuesday, General Motors announced that it would extend to Aug. 1 its highly successful sales promotion, which offers vehicles for the same price that G.M. employees pay. Several hours later, Ford Motor said it, too, would begin selling most of its vehicles at the reduced employee rate. And Chrysler, the American division of DaimlerChrysler, is expected to announce details of an employee discount program of its own on Wednesday, when its sale begins.
7/4/2005	Big Media Wants a Piece Of Your Pod	ALL of us could probably agree that any time Paris Hilton and General Motors converge on the same thing, a significant cultural moment is under way. Recently, those two remarkably different brands decided it was worth their time and effort to put together a podcast. On a podcast for the movie ''House of Wax,'' Ms. Hilton talks about the onerous responsibilities of doing publicity for the film. G.M., meanwhile, used one of its recent podcasts to introduce the 2006 Buick Lucerne, which combines ''high-level technology and luxury features with a spacious quiet interior.'' Notably, the carmaker used rhetoric that might apply equally to the Lucerne or Ms. Hilton: ''Its body is contoured, athletic-looking with a very strong stance.''
7/2/2005	G.M. Sales Surge on Offer To Sell at Employee Price	General Motors sold more vehicles in June than it had in any month since September 1986, propelled by its promotional campaign offering the public the same discounts as G.M. employees for all 2005 models. Sales rose 41 percent, with the company's one-month-old Employee Discount for Everyone program. It appeared to touch the same kind of chord with shoppers as the company's Keep America Rolling campaign did after the Sept. 11 attacks. That campaign was the first to offer sweeping no-interest financing deals.
6/30/2005	G.M. Tops List as Study Questions Pension Accounting	General Motors has the nation's biggest corporate pension fund. And the accounting for that fund may represent the biggest illusion among American corporations. It is no secret that pension accounting is a hall of mirrors that distorts the appearance of both pension plans and the companies that sponsor them. But a new analysis of the 500 largest American companies finds that pension accounting allows nearly all of them with pension funds to inflate their net worth.
6/30/2005	For G.M. Retirees, a Growing Sense of Unease	The Buick plant in Flint, Mich., where Elvia Reeves used to work has been demolished, but her health care benefits are as strong as ever. For now, that is. She and many of the nearly half million American retirees of General Motors are increasingly worried about the future of their medical benefits as the automaker presses the United Automobile Workers union to agree to deep cuts in health care benefits. At the same time, the legal rights of G.M. -- or that of any other company -- to cut benefits for retirees as well as the rights of the retirees' former union to negotiate for them are a matter of debate.
6/28/2005	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Thursday about the president of the United Auto Workers, Ron Gettelfinger, and his expected showdown with General Motors over health benefits misstated the historic role of Walter Reuther. He was the union's president from 1946 until 1970, not its founder.
6/26/2005	A City of Hard Knocks and Hardwood	THIS city, which has endured its share of doozies, had nonetheless seen better days than May 5, when the credit ratings of General Motors and Ford were reduced to junk status by Standard and Poor's. Conventional wisdom says that when G.M. gets a cold, Detroit gets pneumonia. The rating announcement prompted my father -- who worked for years at shops that did subcontracting work for G.M., making our family prone to the periodic case of the sniffles -- to buy 500 shares of Ford stock. ''I like that it's a family company,'' he said. Hard upon his purchase, the stock rose a quarter a share. ''You just made a killing,'' I told him.
6/23/2005	A U.A.W. Chief Awaits a G.M. Showdown	As a negotiator, Ron Gettelfinger, the United Automobile Workers president, is known more for the carrot than the stick. Just don't mistake him for easygoing. This year, he briefly banned marines stationed near Solidarity House, the union's headquarters, from parking in the union lot if they drove foreign cars or had Bush bumper stickers. And in 2001, shortly after being nominated for the union presidency, he summed up his style in one word: ''abrasive.''
6/22/2005	Shifting Michigan Southward; Foreign Automakers, Settled in South, Set Industry's Pace	By most accounts, the United States auto industry is in deep trouble. But don't tell that to the newest workers here in Alabama, where foreign carmakers are redefining the auto industry in America. Automakers from overseas first began building manufacturing plants in this country in the 1970's, largely as a defensive response to protectionist threats. But even as General Motors and Ford have been announcing thousands of job cuts, the foreign automakers are aggressively building new factories and expanding plants they opened not long ago.
6/20/2005	Hot Rodding Reaches for Its Roots	SPLITTING the difference between enthusiasts who insist on restoring classic cars to their original condition and those who create expensive customs is a splinter group: traditionalists intent on reliving the early days of the hot-rodding hobby. At an early June gathering north of Detroit, scores of followers of the growing ''Billetproof'' movement displayed cars fixed up to ''Happy Days'' standards -- scrappy and home-built, with no modern accessories in sight. No styles or designs that came along after 1964 were permitted, and above all, no parts machined from metal billets, the solid hunks that are the basic material of today's customizers.
6/19/2005	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Chevrolet Cobalt; G.M.'s Small-Car Glass Is Now Half Full	I HAVE yet to read the headline, ''Vultures Circle Renaissance Center,'' but as the bad news has multiplied with each passing week, certainly a member of the press must have been assigned to bird-watching duty at General Motors' global headquarters in Detroit. Not a day has gone by in the past month that has not brought some pundit's proclamations of G.M.'s impending demise. A confluence of events -- from slowing S.U.V. sales to multiple debt-rating downgrades, the meddling of the financier Kirk Kerkorian and the announcement of more plant closings and layoffs -- has darkened skies over Detroit. But if a ray of sunshine exists, it is this: Despite the legions of truly awful products G.M. has built in the past three decades, its newest models are vastly improved and generally likable.
6/19/2005	Making a Case for Keyless Ignitions	CHEVROLET dealers are telling Cobalt owners to lighten their key rings to prevent intermittent stalling and the loss of electrical power in their cars. General Motors issued a service bulletin to dealers suggesting this fix. ''In rare cases when a combination of factors is present, a Chevrolet Cobalt driver can cut power to the engine by inadvertently bumping the ignition key to the accessory or off position while the car is running,'' Alan Adler, a manager for safety communications, said. ''Service advisers are telling customers they can virtually eliminate this possibility by taking several steps, including removing nonessential material from their key rings.''
6/19/2005	If the 'S' Stands for Special, This Cobalt Deserves 2 of Them	WHICH 2005 Chevy is fastest through a slalom course? You get one hint: It isn't the Corvette, not even when that sports car is equipped with an optional high-performance suspension. According to Motor Trend, the Cobalt SS Supercharged blistered a 600-foot handling course at 69 miles an hour. The 'Vette it tested was just a bit off the pace, at 68.9 miles an hour, but for $52,470 you could buy two SS Cobalts, with change left over.
6/18/2005	And Wall St. Was Filled With Settlements and Lamentations	JUDGMENT DAY arrived this week for several big names in business and finance, including J.P. Morgan Chase and Bristol-Myers Squibb. General Motors, meanwhile, warned its labor unions to expect their own retribution unless they help the company control its labor costs. FALLOUT FROM ENRON -- J.P. Morgan Chase agreed to pay $2.2 billion to compensate about 50,000 investors hurt when Enron collapsed in an accounting scandal in 2001. The investors -- including institutions, individuals and Enron employees who had bought the company's stock or bonds from September 1997 to December 2001 -- had sued the bank, accusing it of helping Enron to create off-balance-sheet partnerships that hid its overwhelming debt and ultimately precipitated its collapse.
6/18/2005	G.M. Promotions Are Yielding Higher Sales, Study Concludes	The latest effort by General Motors to regain market share and lift falling sales appears to be working, according to an independent analysis of the automaker's recent sales numbers. G.M. began offering its employee discount to all customers on June 1, and its share of the American automotive market has jumped to 30.3 percent, the analysis by J.D. Power & Associates found. That is the highest level in nine months and a significant upswing for a company whose market share has been hovering near 25 percent for much of the year.
6/17/2005	As Toyota Goes ...	So I have a question: If I am rooting for General Motors to go bankrupt and be bought out by Toyota, does that make me a bad person? It is not that I want any autoworker to lose his or her job, but I certainly would not put on a black tie if the entire management team at G.M. got sacked and was replaced by executives from Toyota. Indeed, I think the only hope for G.M.'s autoworkers, and maybe even our country, is with Toyota. Because let's face it, as Toyota goes, so goes America.
6/16/2005	Tough Line By Union To G.M.	Setting up a potential conflict with General Motors, the president of the United Automobile Workers union said Wednesday that he would not agree to change G.M.'s labor contract before it expires in 2007 or to roll back health benefits for G.M. hourly workers to match the lesser benefits of the company's salaried employees. In an extended interview the union's leader, Ron Gettelfinger, said that while he was willing to make concessions to help General Motors within the terms of their existing contract, the two sides were not yet close to reaching an agreement. G.M., he said, had not presented him with enough information to convince him of the severity of the financial situation.
6/15/2005	G.M. Board Gives Union A Deadline	The board of General Motors has given the United Automobile Workers union until the end of the month to agree to cuts in its members' health care benefits, union officials said Tuesday. Many local union leaders have said they were willing to make concessions, but not to the extent that G.M. was seeking. If the union and the company cannot agree by the end of the month, G.M. is threatening to make the cuts on its own. Such a step could lead to a breakdown in G.M.'s relations with the union and possible strikes.
6/13/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; Harvest Season for the '08 Car Colors	FLORIDA is famous for alligator farms and nutria farms and the farms that produce flavorless winter strawberries. To the auto industry, however, Florida is famous for its panel farms. These are the fields where the durability of new automobile paints is tested, determining if the finishes can withstand years of exposure under the state's harsh combination of sun, salt and humidity.
6/13/2005	See the New Car in the Joneses' Driveway? You May Soon Be Driving One Just Like It	EVEN as General Motors' executives were announcing 25,000 jobs cuts last week, they were doing a little advertising of their coming attractions. At G.M.'s annual meeting in Delaware, Robert Lutz, the company's vice chairman, vowed that a burst of on-the-edge new cars and trucks would come forth in the next three years. ''We are in the arts and entertainment business,'' Mr. Lutz said, ''and we're putting a huge emphasis on world-class design.'' But among all the other hurdles Mr. Lutz and his colleagues face, including health care and pension costs and growing foreign competition, a less obvious one may be the biggest threat to their marketing plans: the unforgiving nature of consumer behavior.
6/12/2005	The Nation; What's Bad for G.M. Is . . .	THE announcement last week that General Motors would cut 25,000 jobs and close several factories is yet another blow to the Goliath of automakers and its workers. But only if you work for G.M. is the company's decline a worry. For consumers, the decline can be seen as a symbol of healthy competition. G.M.'s sales, market share and work force have all been falling for a generation, even as the quality of its vehicles has gone up. Why? Because its competitors' products have improved even more. Today's auto buyers enjoy an unprecedented array of well-built, well-equipped, reasonably priced vehicles offered by many manufacturers.
6/12/2005	High-Yield Market Survives G.M. and Ford, but Now What?	THE high-yield bond market has coped surprisingly well with the downgrading last month of General Motors and Ford Motor bonds to junk status. But a caution flag is waving at anyone who is now tempted to jump into the high-yield market.
6/11/2005	Worries for Workers Who Build Cars or Plan on Collecting Pensions	SEVERAL stalwarts of American industry -- General Motors, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines -- took it on the chin this week as they reckoned with years of poor decision making and some worrying global trends. For good measure, Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial institution, reported that one of its units had become the latest company to have misplaced personal data on its customers -- 3.9 million customers, in this case -- that could be used to commit fraud. BIG, BUT ENOUGH? -- General Motors, battling flagging sales, said it would shed 25,000 factory jobs and close some factories by the end of 2008. After the cuts, G.M. will have about 125,000 employees in North America -- 86,000 of them hourly factory workers. That is down almost 80 percent from its peak in the late 1970's, when G.M. had half of the domestic auto market. It now has 22 percent.
6/11/2005	G.M. Shares End Week on a High Note	Shares of General Motors jumped more than 8 percent on Friday, capping a week for the company that included the announcement of 25,000 job cuts and a signal from its largest union that it was willing to renegotiate some parts of the contract. The shares rose $2.70, to $34.51.
6/10/2005	Union Resisting Any Big G.M. Benefit Cuts	Two days after the chairman and chief of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, said he was pressing the United Automobile Workers union for substantial cuts in their health care benefits, a top union leader said the union was still prepared to agree to only modest cuts before G.M.'s labor contract expires in 2007. The message came Thursday at a special meeting of local union leaders who represent G.M. workers from across the country. Though the local union representatives had been in Detroit in April for a meeting with G.M. executives and plant supervisors, they were summoned by union leaders last week to return to Detroit for an update on G.M.'s financial difficulties and discussions with the company.
6/9/2005	Despite G.M.'s Talk of Bold Plans, Analysts Ask if More Needs to Be Done	On Tuesday, almost immediately after Rick Wagoner, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, said he planned to cut 25,000 jobs at the company, analysts were saying it was not enough. But on Wednesday, investors pushed G.M.'s stock up. Were they both right? The analysts remain cautious because G.M. has purged hundreds of thousands of American jobs over the last three decades but has not yet found the formula for lasting success in a world that includes Toyota and other foreign competitors. The analysts said they saw the job cuts, laid out at G.M.'s annual meeting in Delaware, as a first step. But they are still looking for a fuller strategy from Mr. Wagoner.
6/8/2005	A Relief: Some Gains For Hedges	Whew. Hedge funds, which had been buffeted in early May by talk of huge losses tied to General Motors securities, managed to end the month with modest gains, according to firms that track the funds' performance.
6/8/2005	G.M.'s Ever-Shrinking Labor Force	Jayne Atwell describes herself as a ''G.M. gypsy,'' a name General Motors workers have for people who have been shuffled from plant to plant over the years as the company has closed factories and cut its labor force. ''I've had five plants in the last 10 years and I'm still hanging in there,'' said Ms. Atwell, 42, who now builds dashboards at the G.M. Flint Truck Assembly plant here.
6/8/2005	G.M. WILL REDUCE HOURLY WORKERS IN U.S. BY 25,000	General Motors said Tuesday that it would cut about 25,000 jobs from its blue-collar work force in the United States by the end of 2008, in a broad move to reckon with its declining grip on the American car market. The cuts, which represent about 22 percent of the hourly work force, would bring G.M.'s nationwide employment to 86,000 hourly workers, roughly the number it employed in the city of Flint, Mich., in the 1970's. The action will include an unspecified number of plant closings and is the most sweeping single job cut announced since 1992, though G.M. has already eliminated nearly 30,000 hourly and salaried workers over the last five years. The company hopes to continue to make the cuts largely through buyout and early retirement offers and to avoid layoffs.
6/6/2005	Ready or Not, G.M.'s Chief Is About to Face Some Questions	Inside the Hyatt Regency in Dearborn, Mich., Rick Wagoner, chief executive of General Motors, and other top G.M. officials were meeting on the morning of April 17 with union leaders from around the country. Outside, a throng of reporters staked out the front and back exits. A black Cadillac sedan and a GMC Yukon sport utility were parked at the back exit, waiting, it appeared, for someone important. Just before lunchtime, a security guard stuck his head out the door and flashed a thumbs up. The two vehicles roared off, swooped around the hotel to a third, locked exit, and collected Mr. Wagoner, executing a perfect media head fake.
6/5/2005	The Rough Road Ahead For G.M. and Ford	THE American automotive industry is facing its darkest hours in decades, says Dietmar A. Ostermann, vice president and auto industry specialist at the consulting firm A.T. Kearney and a former BMW engineer. Huge layoffs, he says, are the only solution. Here are excerpts from a conversation: Q. How serious is the situation that General Motors and Ford are facing? A. It's the worst it has been in the 20 years that I've been associated with the automotive industry. Q. What is at the root of the problem? A. Consumer demands are shifting. General Motors and Ford have not been at the forefront of those demand shifts. Quality is a very significant issue, whether perceived or real. Companies such as Toyota have been given a lot of credit on that score. There's a lot of volume shift away from Ford and G.M. toward Toyota, Honda and Nissan. This trend will continue.
6/3/2005	A Club for Every Car, Even the Pinto	THE annual migration of Pontiac Aztek owners to Cedar Point, Ohio, may not be in the same league as, say the movement of the humpback whale from Alaska to its Hawaiian breeding grounds, but they do have something in common: a need for companionship made more intense when the species is endangered. Automotive gatherings normally celebrate the rare classics, like the million-dollar Duesenbergs, Auburns and Hispano Suizas at the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach, Calif. Others attract more contemporary objects d'art--like the American muscle cars at the Woodward Dream Cruise in Detroit. But what could draw the 300 Volkswagen New Beetle owners who for the last five years have descended each spring on Roswell, N.M.?
6/1/2005	G.M. to Offer Big Discounts Just for June	General Motors will announce a major sales promotion for June that will offer customers the same discounts as G.M. employees for most of the company's 2005 model cars and trucks, people with knowledge of the plan said. The strategy is expected to be announced on Wednesday along with sales results for May. It could lead to hundreds or thousands of dollars of additional discounts on some vehicles.
5/30/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; For Pace Cars, a Life Beyond Indy	LEADING the racecars to the green flag for the start of the Indianapolis 500 each Memorial Day weekend -- ahead of even the pole winner -- is a vehicle that stands out from the pack just by looking normal. Aside from some extra-bold lettering on its flanks and the flashing strobe lights front and rear, the car at the front of this noisy swarm resembles many new models in dealership showrooms. A pace car is more than a symbolic parade leader, though, even if celebrities like Jay Leno and Morgan Freeman are often drafted to take the wheel for the race start. (A Chevrolet Corvette driven by Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state and current 'Vette owner, is the most recent to lead the way at Indy.) In use since the first Indy 500 in 1911, its job is to bring the 33 racecars to speed for a rolling start, which is less perilous than a standing start. It also leads during yellow-flag caution periods, exiting the track before racing resumes.
5/25/2005	C.E.O.'s, M.I.A.	After six weeks of being a foreign correspondent traveling around America, the biggest question I have come home with is not ''What's the matter with Kansas?'' but rather, ''What's the matter with big business?'' America faces a huge set of challenges if it is going to retain its competitive edge. As a nation, we have a mounting education deficit, energy deficit, budget deficit, health care deficit and ambition deficit. The administration is in denial on this, and Congress is off on Mars. And yet, when I look around for the group that has both the power and interest in seeing America remain globally focused and competitive -- America's business leaders -- they seem to be missing in action. I am not worried about the rise of the cultural conservatives. I am worried about the disappearance of an internationalist, pro-American business elite.
5/25/2005	Fitch Cuts G.M. to Junk, Citing Poor S.U.V. Sales	Citing declining sales of larger sport utility vehicles, Fitch Ratings on Tuesday became the second of the three major debt ratings agencies to cut its rating on General Motors below investment grade. The downgrade to junk status reflects Wall Street's increasingly dim view of G.M.'s prospects and will prevent many large bond investors from buying bonds from G.M., which has traditionally been one of the nation's largest bond issuers. More lenient rules soon to go into effect at Lehman Brothers, which maintains the most closely watched corporate bond index, require companies to maintain an investment-grade rating from two of the three credit agencies. Standard & Poor's downgraded G.M., as well as the Ford Motor Company, to junk on May 5.
5/22/2005	Cadillac Slips Into Something A Bit Racy	TELEVISION tells us what housewives do when they are desperate, or at least what happens when the spouses of Wisteria Lane feel neglected. Car companies that find themselves in a similar fix -- hungry for attention and unable to arouse interest on the home front -- are obliged to take a different approach. Increasingly, automakers are tarting up standard models with upgrades to their style or performance -- or both. Spurred by the success of special high-performance models from German companies -- cars like the BMW M3 and various AMG-label cars from Mercedes-Benz -- automakers from Detroit, Japan and Britain are setting up their own in-house ''tuner'' operations to turn out limited-edition, premium-price cars with performance enhancements.
5/20/2005	G.M.'s Brands To Cut Back On Variety	Facing its worst financial outlook in more than a decade, General Motors outlined a new product development and sales strategy Thursday, saying that from now on Chevrolet and Cadillac would be the company's only brands to offer a full lineup of vehicles. That means G.M.'s other six brands marketed in the United States will focus on a narrower selection of segments. GMC and Hummer will continue to sell trucks while Pontiac, Saab and Saturn will focus mostly on cars and smaller S.U.V.'s, with Buick offering some of both.

5/15/2005	The Shopper's Guide to Those Blue-Chip Specials	HUGE losses in stocks of onetime corporate titans have left shareholders as blue as their chips. Bellwethers like I.B.M., Lucent Technologies, American International Group, Eastman Kodak, General Motors and Ford Motor -- which may be less admired than they used to be, but are still widely held in portfolios -- have fallen more than 15 percent this year, against a backdrop of modestly weak market averages. But a few of the downtrodden corporate icons have begun to show new signs of life, as investors begin to nibble at them -- or, in a recent, high-profile example, take a giant chunk out of one.
5/13/2005	Always Low Wages. Always	Last week Standard and Poor's, a bond rating agency, downgraded both Ford and General Motors bonds to junk status. That is, it sees a significant risk that the companies won't be able to pay their debts.
5/13/2005	Corrections	The Advertising column in Business Day yesterday, about a decision by General Motors to move its United States media buying from agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, misstated the scope of an earlier decision by Unilever to shift some duties from an Interpublic agency called Initiative. Initiative still handles Unilever assignments in several markets; Unilever did not stop using the agency.
5/12/2005	Interpublic suffers another blow as General Motors consolidates media planning and buying at Publicis.	IN another blow to the Interpublic Group of Companies, General Motors said yesterday that it would consolidate responsibility for its media assignments in the United States at an agency owned by an Interpublic competitor, the Publicis Groupe. The decision means that the Publicis agency will decide how to plan and buy advertising for all G.M. brands and dealer associations -- advertising that cost an estimated $3.6 billion in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence.
5/11/2005	Big Payment From G.M. Helps Fiat Post Its First Profitable Quarter in 3 Years	The Italian carmaker Fiat posted its first quarterly profit in more than three years, helped into the black by one billion euros paid by General Motors to dissolve their partnership. The company said Tuesday that its net profit was 295 million euros ($379 million) in the first quarter, a turnaround from a 390 million euro loss in the year-earlier period. Fiat booked a gain of 715 million euros from the G.M. payout in February.
5/11/2005	Hedge Fund Rumors Rattle Markets	Long-simmering worries about the growing influence of hedge funds erupted yesterday in a wave of nervous selling on world stock markets after talk that hedge funds had suffered large losses tied to the debt of General Motors. Shares of banks with connections to hedge funds fell sharply, even though the rumors could not be substantiated. Hedge funds, lightly regulated investment pools for the wealthy and institutions like pension funds, have been a source of concern for some investors because the recent flood of money into the funds appears to some to have the earmarks of an investment bubble.
5/10/2005	Corrections	A chart in Business Day on Friday with an article about the credit ratings of General Motors and Ford included an erroneous entry for the United States Steel Corporation. The company's current rating is BB, not BBB+.
5/10/2005	In Filing, Kerkorian Shows More of His Hand to G.M.	The billionaire financier and casino magnate, Kirk Kerkorian, has hired a former auto executive who advised him in an abortive takeover of Chrysler in the 1990's to help with an offer to acquire 9 percent of General Motors. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Mr. Kerkorian's investment firm, Tracinda, said that it had hired the executive, Jerome B. York, to assist in buying an additional 28 million G.M. shares. The filing also left open the possibility of Mr. Kerkorian's trying to exert some influence over G.M. if he is successful in his acquisition.
5/9/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; A Wealth of Materials That Say 'Material Wealth'	THE gleaming metallic surfaces inside the Scion t2B, a design study introduced at the New York auto show last March, defied easy identification. Was it steel? Fabric? The eye debated.
5/7/2005	Not the Week To Be or to Own The Bluest Chips	It was a week to give owners of blue chips the blues. The greatest names of American capitalism seemed to vie with one another to see which company could have the most depressing news. General Electric joined the parade yesterday, revealing that its auditors had discovered that, for the last three years, it had failed to apply correctly an accounting rule and would have to restate its financial results.
5/6/2005	A Big Splash, Ripples to Follow; G.M. and Ford Debt Ratings Downgraded Sooner Than Expected	Many investors knew it was coming, but they did not expect that two of the nation's biggest issuers of bonds would be reduced to junk status so soon. As a result, Standard & Poor's announcement at midday yesterday that it was cutting its credit ratings for both General Motors and the Ford Motor Company set off a selling spree in the corporate bond market. The rating cut to below investment grade begins a process of adjustment that could ripple through, and roil, the fixed-income markets for weeks.
5/6/2005	CREDIT RANKINGS OF G.M. AND FORD ARE CUT TO JUNK	General Motors and Ford Motor lost their investment grade ratings Thursday, pushing two of corporate America's biggest borrowers into the ranks of junk bonds and rattling the financial markets with the message that the collective fortunes of the remaining two domestically owned automakers have sunk to their lowest points yet. The downgrading by Standard & Poor's, the credit agency, reflects the inability of G.M. and Ford to make enough cars that people will buy without $5,000 rebates and other sales incentives, as well as worries that the two automakers may not emerge anytime soon from their troubles, starting with eroding earnings and sliding sales.
5/5/2005	Kerkorian Seeking 9% Stake in G.M.	Kirk Kerkorian, the multi-billionaire casino operator and financier, said today that he was making an offer that would give him a stake worth nearly 9 percent in General Motors, the struggling Detroit auto giant whose stock recently hit a 12-year low. Coming from Mr. Kerkorian, an 87-year-old with a history of taking big stakes and exerting varying degrees of control over airlines, casinos, automakers and movie studios, the news surprised Detroit and Wall Street. G.M. shares surged 18 percent, closing at $32.80, up $5.03.
5/5/2005	Investor's Move Raises Pension Questions	Kirk Kerkorian's announcement of a tender offer for 28 million shares of General Motors' stock caught the attention yesterday of retirement finance specialists. General Motors has promised tens of billions of dollars in pensions and retiree medical benefits to its work force -- promises that are hurting its ability to compete. And while Mr. Kerkorian said yesterday that his investment would be passive, his track record left many analysts skeptical.

5/4/2005	Ford and G.M. Suffer as Buyers Shun S.U.V.'s	The latest automobile sales figures show that Americans are increasingly wary of gas-thirsty sport utility vehicles. That was particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which both saw their sales slip last month as consumers continued their steady march into Asian car companies' dealerships. Both Toyota and Nissan posted record sales gains in April, which helped push overall auto sales in North America up 1.8 percent.

FOR Buick owners, there was good news and bad news in the car-theft reports released last fall by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The good news was that three of the five cars with the lowest theft-claim rates were Buicks. You can sleep peacefully, secure that your LeSabre, Park Avenue or Rendezvous is unlikely to be gone in 60 seconds.
4/26/2005	General Motors Issues Recalls For More Than 2 Million Cars	General Motors issued several wide-ranging recalls on Monday involving more than two million vehicles, including some of its most popular and profitable sport utility vehicles, the Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon and Hummer H2. The largest recall covers 1.5 million pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s with defective second-row center seat belts. G.M. told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last week that the belts fasten too high above a passenger's hips and increase the risk of injury in a crash, particularly to smaller passengers. In a letter to the safety administration, G.M. said the defect could expose passengers ''to more risk of abdominal and internal organ injury.''
4/23/2005	CONFLICTING ROLES PROMPT RESIGNATION FROM G.M. BOARD	General Motors said yesterday that Alan G. Lafley had resigned from its board because he was also a director of the General Electric Company, which competes with G.M. in financial services. Mr. Lafley, 57, who is chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company, left after a periodic assessment required under antitrust law, G.M. said. The automaker said Erskine Bowles, 59, who was White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, had been nominated for the board. Mr. Lafley joined G.M.'s board in August 2001 and became a General Electric director in October 2002. Mr. Bowles will be among 12 nominees for election to the board at the June 7 annual meeting.
4/23/2005	Bicoastal Blues For G.M. and Ford	Setting aside its home base in the Upper Midwest, Detroit has a blue state problem -- and it is about to get worse. Washington and Oregon plan to become the 9th and 10th states to adopt California's tough car emissions rules, forming an increasingly potent market for more fuel-efficient vehicles on the West Coast and in the Northeast.
4/22/2005	China Looms As the World's Next Leading Auto Exporter	Industrial heartlands from the Great Lakes region to Germany, look out -- here comes the Chinese auto industry. A senior DaimlerChrysler executive, Ruediger Grube, startled a roomful of journalists and his own aides at the Shanghai Auto Show on Thursday by disclosing that the company intended to export small cars from China to the United States. Daimler is already in talks with one of its Chinese joint-venture partners to build a factory for the exports, he said, and would like to work out the details and make a final decision on the project in the second half of the year.
4/20/2005	Signs of a Rebound, Even as G.M.'s Asian Profits Fall	General Motors' profits in Asia plummeted in the first quarter, but the first hints of a rebound are starting to become visible in China, the automaker's most important Asian market, company executives and analysts said Tuesday. Automakers post profits based on their sales to independent dealers, not the dealers' sales to the public. G.M. cut its shipments to dealers in China by half in January and February, mostly blaming inventories of unsold cars that swelled as the government tried to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace.

None of the seedy roadside hubcap hawkers I drove past seemed to have one. I searched highway medians from time to time, though without much hope of success. So imagine my surprise one day, on the way home from the market, to find an exact match, right along the road! I pounded it into place and drove happily on.
4/18/2005	AS STOCKS SLIDE, INVESTORS FOCUS ON EARNINGS DATA	After last week's market plunge -- when America's three main stock gauges fell more than 3 percent -- Wall Street and unusually nervous individual investors are looking to the flood of earnings reports this week to see how optimistic corporate America is in its outlook for the economy. Almost a third of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and almost half the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average are to report earnings for the first three months of the year. But more importantly, many of them will comment on the financial quarters ahead and could either counter or reinforce the current pessimism about the economy.

Tumble On Issue of Health Care	Shares of General Motors fell to a 12-year low Thursday as the company's annual meeting with labor leaders yielded little hope that workers might take on a significantly greater share of health care costs. G.M. also spent the day dismissing rumors of a bankruptcy filing and playing down a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to an investigation of its largest supplier, Delphi.
4/15/2005	G.M. and Ford Stuck in Reverse As Buyers Look Beyond Detroit	In just the last few weeks, the grand plans that were supposed to carry General Motors and Ford Motor into their second centuries have crumbled. Sales at G.M. have fallen, profits have tumbled to losses. Last week, Ford also warned of a drop in earnings. Thursday, in yet another blow, its union refused to give much ground on G.M.'s health care coverage. If that were not enough, G.M.'s stock hit a 12-year low. [Page C1.]
4/11/2005	G.M.'s snub of The Los Angeles Times is just the latest battle between marketers and media outlets.	IT is the reality show that no one on Madison Avenue wants to watch: ''When Advertisers Attack.'' Marketers have been turning on media outlets for offenses real and perceived, for almost as long as there has been advertising space and commercial time to buy. Although marketers and media companies do business together, they are not in the same business, a distinction that manifests itself in fractious disputes caused by the tension between the media's right to say what they please and marketers' right to advertise where they please.
4/8/2005	G.M. to Halt Ads in The Los Angeles Times	General Motors said yesterday that it would stop advertising in The Los Angeles Times ''until further notice.'' A G.M. spokeswoman characterized the decision as the culmination of a long-running dispute between the automaker and the newspaper over how G.M. is portrayed. ''It involves news reporting, it involves opinion. It's pretty broad-based, and we've made our objections well known to The Times,'' the G.M. spokeswoman, Ryndee Carney, said.
4/7/2005	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a decision by the chief executive of General Motors to take control of North American operations misspelled the surname of a securities analyst at UBS who commented on the plan. He is Robert Hinchliffe, not Hinchcliffe.
4/7/2005	G.M. TO BUILD HUMMER H3'S IN SOUTH AFRICA	General Motors will start building its forthcoming Hummer H3 sport utility vehicle at a plant in South Africa by the end of next year and intends to sell 10,000 of the vehicles annually in Europe and the Middle East, the company said yesterday. The move will be the brand's first production outside of the United States, though G.M. now exports about 10 percent of its Hummers to various foreign markets. The H3 is a smaller and relatively cheaper version of the Hummer that will be built domestically in Shreveport, La. Hummer's sales have slumped in the last couple of years, but Susan Docherty, Hummer's general manager, said the brand was profitable and added that rising gas prices would not dim its prospects. Referring to the wealth of her customers, she said, ''Quite frankly, the price of gas is not driving their decision to purchase the Hummer.'' Danny Hakim (NYT)
4/6/2005	MOODY'S DROPS G.M.'S DEBT RATING TO JUST ABOVE JUNK	Moody's Investors Service downgraded its rating of General Motors' debt to Baa3, its lowest investment grade rating, and put the Ford Motor Company under review for a possible downgrade. Moody's now has Ford's debt rated Baa1, two grades above the new G.M. rating. Moody's also put G.M. on a negative outlook, suggesting a further downgrade to a junk bond rating is possible. The move brought Moody's rating of G.M.'s debt in line with the ratings of the other two major ratings firms, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. The downgrade was prompted by G.M.'s announcement last month that it was scaling back its projections for earnings and cash flow for this year. Danny Hakim (NYT)
4/5/2005	Chief of G.M. Takes Control Of Operations	With General Motors losing its once dominant grip on American car buyers, its chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner, took direct control of the company's North American operations on Monday in an effort to overcome a drought in profit and sales. Mr. Wagoner, 52, reduced the authority of the two most senior North American executives, Robert A. Lutz and Gary Cowger, in a move analysts saw as a sign that his job depends on fixing the company's performance at home. Lucrative sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles propped up G.M.'s performance in the late 1990's until competitors like Toyota and Nissan let loose a wave of their own trucks.
4/3/2005	River Rights and Wrongs	AS the deadline approaches for public comment on the proposed redevelopment at the General Motors site in Sleepy Hollow, it is important to look at the project in the larger context of the past -- and future -- history of the Hudson River waterfront. For nearly two centuries, New Yorkers have been largely cut off from the Hudson -- separated by rail lines and industrial activity along both shores. By the middle of the 20th century, the lack of public access didn't matter since the Hudson had become so polluted with sewage and dangerous chemicals that few had much interest in getting out on -- let alone in -- the river.
4/2/2005	U.S. Automakers Lose Ground to Rivals	Auto sales perked up in March, though domestic carmakers continued to lose ground to foreign competitors. Sales at General Motors fell 1.5 percent and were down 4.9 percent at Ford Motor from the month a year earlier, while Nissan Motor reported a 12.6 percent increase, the first time the company had sold more than 100,000 cars and trucks in the United States in a month.
4/1/2005	Shifting Buyer Trends Set Back Western Carmakers in China	In the first months of the year, the Chinese slowed their purchases of automobiles, and the cars they did buy tended to be small and inexpensive -- trends that are hurting Western manufacturers like General Motors and Volkswagen. The Chinese auto market has been the best source of growth and profits in recent years for American and European manufacturers. But total vehicle shipments from manufacturers to dealers in China slowed by 10 percent in January and February compared with those months last year.
3/30/2005	How can General Motors remake itself? Here are some ideas from those in the marketing business.	THERE used to be a saying that what's good for General Motors is good for America. But that was in the days when one of every two cars sold in the United States bore a G.M. brand name. Now, with its market share falling toward 25 percent, General Motors is struggling to revive its core business -- selling America its cars, trucks and minivans -- and seems in need of a few good ideas. The problem is not the size of the General Motors advertising budget. Last year, the company spent almost $3 billion to advertise to American consumers, according to TNS Media Intelligence, second only to Procter & Gamble.
3/30/2005	G.M. Manager in China Resigns As Competition There Heats Up	Philip F. Murtaugh, the General Motors executive who turned the company's operations in China into one of G.M.'s few successes in recent years, has unexpectedly resigned from the automaker, citing personal reasons, people with knowledge of his decision said on Wednesday. G.M. officials declined to comment on Mr. Murtaugh's plans. But his departure coincides with growing competitiveness and reduced profitability for all automakers in the Chinese market, as well as an effort by G.M. executives in Detroit to unite the company's global operations.
3/30/2005	GENERAL MOTORS SEEKING TO SELL STAKE IN MORTGAGE UNIT	The General Motors Corporation is in talks with a group of investors to sell a stake in its commercial mortgage unit to raise cash for the business, a spokeswoman said yesterday. ''This unit has been self-funded since we considered selling it two years ago,'' the spokeswoman, Toni Simonetti, said. ''We think it can grow even faster with the advantage of additional capital.'' Proceeds of a sale would stay with the commercial mortgage business, which G.M. tried to sell two years ago for as much as $2 billion.
3/27/2005	The Nation; Detroit's New Crisis Could Be Its Worst	BIG SLICE has a prescription for the ills facing Detroit's automakers. ''They need to step their game up and put their ear to the streets,'' said the bear-sized 32-year-old who lives outside Los Angeles and customizes cars and buses for the rapper and trendsetter Snoop Dogg that include a purple and gold 1967 Pontiac Parisienne signed by several Los Angeles Lakers. ''Go put your ear to the street and ask people what they want instead of trying to force something on people,'' he said. ''They're making ugly cars.''
3/27/2005	End of the Auto Show Season: That's All There Is?	NEW YORK often puts an exclamation point at the end of the winter-spring season of international auto shows. This year, however, the New York International Auto Show raises an ambiguous question mark: Is that -- apologies to Peggy Lee -- all there is? The 105-year-old New York show, which opened Friday and runs through next Sunday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, does have this distinction: it displays the collective cream of the crop from all the big shows that preceded it this year, in Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and Geneva. But it is a fairly meager yield. Many people in the industry and the automotive press say that in terms of exciting new products and innovative design, 2005 has been one of most lackluster years in recent memory.
3/24/2005	G.M. Makes $50 Million Deal to Be Sponsor	After an eight-year absence, General Motors rejoined Major League Baseball yesterday as a national sponsor through 2007 with a deal worth at least $50 million. ''It's been a long time since we heard, 'Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet,''' Bob DuPuy, baseball's president and chief operating officer, said yesterday at a news conference in Manhattan to announce the agreement to make Chevrolet baseball's official vehicle.
3/24/2005	G.M. to Seek Cuts in Union Health Benefits	Facing their worst financial outlook in years, executives at General Motors said yesterday that they wanted union workers to accept the same health benefit cuts already taken by white-collar workers. ''We need a competitive plan for all of our employees,'' said Gary Cowger, G.M.'s head of North American operations, in a speech at the New York International Auto Show. ''An across-the-board competitive health care plan for salaried and hourly employees could save us billions of dollars a year.''
3/23/2005	A Day of Volatile Trading in G.M. Bonds	When investors are nervous about a company, ripples of news can lead to tremors in the financial markets. So it is with General Motors. The automaker has been under the microscope since it announced last week that it would report two consecutive quarterly losses -- in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of this year -- sending its stock to its lowest point in more than 10 years.
3/22/2005	Big Three Workers Give an Inch on Health Care	Like other Big Three auto workers, Deborah Stewart has medical coverage that is, if not a free lunch, then close to it. No deductibles. No monthly premiums. But Ms. Stewart, who works at a sprawling General Motors complex in the shadows of the Detroit skyline, says she believes it cannot last. ''They're losing money, saying they've got to make changes, and I think everybody expects that it's going to come,'' said Ms. Stewart, 55, referring to cuts in health care benefits. A 30-year G.M. veteran who oversees robots that attach fenders to cars, she was heading out after her shift Monday at the Detroit/Hamtramck assembly plant, which produces cars like the Buick LeSabre. ''I think it will come,'' she said, ''without a doubt.''
3/22/2005	CHIEF OF GENERAL MOTORS BUYS 50,000 SHARES	The chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, who last week forecast the company's biggest quarterly loss since 1992, bought $1.5 million worth of the company's shares, raising his stake in the company by 25 percent in what he said was a vote of confidence. Mr. Wagoner bought 50,000 shares at an average price of about $29.65, a G.M. spokesman said. G.M. stock rose $1.07, to $29.69 a share.
3/18/2005	Putting a Car of the Future Back on the Road	IN the dim half-light of a Long Island garage, a handful of DeLoreans stand in darkened corners or suspended on hydraulic lifts, their trademark gull-wing doors ajar, their stainless-steel silver shells still ultramodern more than two decades after the DeLorean Motor Company went bust. Visible through a dusty window in the parking lot outside, perhaps 20 more DeLoreans, lined up and identical, sit waiting, like some surreal automotive dream. This is P.J. Grady's, a modest gray automotive garage tucked behind a used-car lot in West Sayville, N.Y. As the sign on its roof -- DeLorean Motor Cars -- indicates, the shop specializes in the repair and restoration of DeLoreans, the famous and doomed early-1980's sports car created by John Z. DeLorean and featured in the ''Back to the Future'' movies.
3/17/2005	Oil and G.M.'s Dim Outlook Push Shares Down Sharply	General Motors' prediction of a loss in the first quarter and a new high for the price of crude oil were just too much for stocks yesterday, as the three main market gauges dropped 0.8 percent or more. European stock markets also fell on the news. The stock market decline was led by economically sensitive stocks, including G.M. The automaker's struggles, along with oil at $56.46 a barrel, could be signaling a fall-off in consumer spending, which would mean slower economic growth and lower corporate earnings. ''It was a growth-scare market,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''G.M. raised the idea that the consumer may be slowing down.'' G.M.'s announcement, in which it forecast a loss this quarter of around $1.50 a share, also helped drag down the investment-grade and high-yield bond markets. Some analysts said the selling could continue in the weeks ahead. The price of G.M.'s 6.75 percent bond maturing in 2014 fell to $90.05, a 3.8 percent drop, as the yield jumped to 8.26 percent, from 7.69 percent Tuesday, according to J.P. Morgan. G.M. bonds were battered not only by the company announcement but also by three credit rating agencies that all responded negatively to the news. Fitch Ratings downgraded G.M. bonds to BBB-, its lowest investment-grade rating. Standard & Poor's changed G.M.'s outlook to negative, which means the rating agency could reduce G.M.'s rating to below investment grade, or junk bond status, in the months ahead. Moody's Investors Service put G.M. on review, which means the company could be knocked down to Moody's lowest investment-grade rating in the weeks ahead. Unlike the stock market, the investment-grade corporate and high-yield bond markets had been very hot recently, with several indicators showing their price valuations to be at or near multiyear highs. But because Treasury interest rates have risen sharply in the last month -- the yield on the 10-year note jumped half a percentage point to 4.55 percent -- sentiment in the corporate bond market has changed recently, said Stephen Antczak, fixed-income strategist at UBS. ''And this was a catalyst for more profit taking,'' he said, referring to the news from G.M. ''I would expect overall sentiment to remain cautious,'' he added, especially because it is just a few weeks until companies begin announcing their earnings for the first quarter. Edward B. Marrinan, head investment-grade strategist at J.P. Morgan, said another factor weighing on corporate bonds recently was bad news at other big companies, including the ouster of the chief executive of American International Group, Maurice R. Greenberg, and the downgrading of Liberty Media to junk bond status by Fitch Ratings. ''The corporate bond market is under some pressure,'' he said. ''But I would not say we have reached a turning point. There is resilience in the bond market because we still have too many people who want to own bonds.'' The government's report that the current-account deficit was a record $666 billion last year, and the dollar's fall in response to that news, also weighed on financial markets. The euro was valued at $1.3414 as the dollar fell 0.7 percent. The dollar dropped 0.3 percent against the yen, to 104.12.. While prices in the Treasury market rose and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell, some analysts said this was because money from the corporate bond market and the stock market was looking for a safe place to take cover for awhile. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32 to 95 31/32 while the yield slipped to 4.51 percent, from 4.54 percent Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 112.03 points, or 1 percent, to 10,633.07. GM's stocks fell $4.71, or 14 percent to $29.01, its lowest since the end of 1994. The G.M. decline accounted for about 35 points of the Dow's decline. The fall in G.M. and other economically sensitive stocks in the Dow, including Alcoa, Citigroup, Caterpillar and DuPont, accounted for about 53 points of the Dow's fall. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.68 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,188.07. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 19.23 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,015.75.
3/17/2005	G.M. SEES A LOSS NEAR $1 BILLION; STOCK FALLS 14%	General Motors' stock fell to its lowest level in more than a decade Wednesday after the company said it expected to post a loss of nearly $1 billion for the last six months. The news set off G.M.'s largest single-day share loss since the market collapse of 1987 and further darkened Wall Street assessments of the company, the world's largest automaker. The losses reflected an increasingly harsh reality: that General Motors, which three years ago was thought to be the healthiest of the Big Three automakers in Detroit, is now considered the weakest, primarily because it is not selling enough cars at home. The losses also raised questions about the strategy of the company's chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner.
3/14/2005	General Motors Starts Media Buying Review	General Motors has placed in review the media buying assignments for all its national advertising as well as regional dealer groups. G.M. spent an estimated $2.8 billion to advertise last year in major American media, according to TNS Media Intelligence. The national media buying is handled by General Motors Mediaworks in Warren, Mich., which was formed by the Interpublic Group of Companies in 1993 to handle that task. Another Interpublic agency, LCI in New York, handles the regional media buying. The review will pit them against the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe, whose sibling, General Motors Planworks in Detroit, was formed in 2000 to handle media planning, which is deciding where advertisements will appear.
3/12/2005	Delphi Disclosures Raise Questions on Chief's Exit	J.T. Battenberg III, chairman and chief executive of Delphi, has been a steady hand in an uncertain industry. At least until last week.
3/11/2005	How Long Can G.M. Tread Water?	Since the Depression, General Motors has reigned as the world's largest automaker and a pillar of American economic might. But now the company is broadly struggling and facing the humbling possibility that it will be displaced by Toyota at the top of the auto industry within a few years. General Motors, which controlled nearly half the American market as recently as the late 1970's, held about one-quarter in February. Last week, the company said that it would produce 300,000 fewer cars and trucks in North America in the first half of this year, a 10 percent drop from a year ago.
3/11/2005	Teaching Some New Samba Steps to G.M. Brazil	Since taking over at General Motors in Brazil just over a year ago, Ray G. Young has given the country's automobile industry a lot to talk about. In October, Mr. Young became the impromptu star of S?o Paulo's auto show when he danced enthusiastically to the Paul Rodgers song ''All Right Now'' as G.M. showcased its latest vehicles. And last month, the Brazilian media published pictures of him trying out some samba steps at a celebration of G.M.'s 80th anniversary in the country.
3/8/2005	PLANT SHUTDOWN WILL REDUCE PROFIT AT GENERAL MOTORS	General Motors said yesterday that its first-quarter profit would be reduced by about $79 million by the shutdown of a Lansing, Mich., plant that makes vehicles that are being discontinued. Production of the Pontiac Grand Am and Chevrolet Classic cars will end, and the factory's 3,000 workers will be laid off in the second quarter, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. G.M. also said it expected monthly costs of about $13 million for pay and benefits of laid-off workers and a future shutdown expense of as much as $16 million. G.M. is trying to cut costs and reduce capacity as it loses market share in the United States.
3/7/2005	Most New Small Cars Get Lowest Rating in Crash Test	New research shows that small cars are not being built well enough to stand up to sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in side impacts. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by car insurers, conducted the research and released its report Sunday night. In it, the institute said 14 of 16 small cars received the lowest of four possible safety ratings in a side-impact collision.
3/7/2005	Birds and Glass Buildings	To the Editor: Re ''A Cube in the Land of the Wheel: Redefining Public Space at the G.M. Building'' (news article, March 2): Although the redesign of the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue seems attractive, it will likely be hazardous to birds, which cannot recognize glass as a solid surface.
3/6/2005	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Chevrolet Corvette; Of Speed, Style, Vision And Missed Opportunities	LET'S get this out of the way right at the start: the 2005 Chevrolet Corvette is the best high-performance bargain on the planet, bar none. There is simply no other way to park a sports car of this caliber in your driveway for less than $45,000. To wit, when the glossy car magazines look for a worthy challenger to run hot laps against the 'Vette, they tend to pick the venerable Porsche 911 -- a car with a base price of $79,895 and actual stickers that usually run much higher.
3/5/2005	G.M. Picks Germany, Not Sweden, as Home of New Saabs	For the last several months, this humdrum German car town has vied against a prettier rival, Trollhattan in Sweden, for the affections of General Motors as it deliberated about where to build its next generation of cars in Europe. On Friday, G.M. made its choice, and announced it would build midsize Opels and Saabs in Germany rather than in Sweden.
3/4/2005	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the introduction of new cars in Europe by the Cadillac division of General Motors and the Dodge unit of DaimlerChrysler misstated the birthplace of Dieter Zetsche, the head of Chrysler. It is Turkey, not Germany. The article also credited the Cadillac BLS erroneously with a first. Several Cadillac models in the 1980's were offered with a diesel engine.
3/3/2005	With Terror in Mind, a Formulaic Way to Parse Sentences	MAYBE sixth-grade English was more helpful than you thought. One of the dullest grammar exercises is being used to help find potential terrorists, and save companies a bundle. Diagramming sentences -- picking out subject, verb, object, adjective and other parts of speech -- has been a staple of middle and high school grammar lessons for decades. Now, with financing from the Central Intelligence Agency, a California firm is using the technique to comb through e-mail messages and chat room talks, which can be a rich lode of corporate and government information, and a tough one to mine.
3/3/2005	Taking Down the 'No Foreign Cars' Signs in Michigan	At many union halls in Michigan, signs on parking lots still warn that foreign-made cars ''will be towed away at owner's expense.'' So why is Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, pushing so hard to close a sweetheart land deal with Toyota Motor?
3/2/2005	Europe, Meet Cadillac and Dodge	A week after President Bush toured Europe to try to patch up the tattered trans-Atlantic relationship, the American car industry is embarking on its own charm offensive. Whether Detroit will make more headway than Washington is anybody's guess. Cadillac, a unit of General Motors, and the Dodge unit of DaimlerChrysler unveiled new cars at the Geneva Motor Show on Tuesday that they hope will lead a fresh push into the European market.
3/2/2005	G.M. and Ford Lose Ground In Sales Again	The gears of the domestic auto industry are grinding again, with shares of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company trading near one-year lows and the companies continuing to lose customers. Sales at G.M. fell 12.6 percent in February from the same month a year earlier, according to monthly sales reports released by automakers on Tuesday; Ford's sales fell 2.8 percent. Both companies scaled back the numbers of cars and trucks they planned to make as unsold models accumulate on dealer lots, though G.M.'s cut were deeper and it is showing few signs of a turnaround.
3/2/2005	A Cube in the Land of the Wheel; Redefining Public Space at the G.M. Building	Having failed sadly in its emulation of Rockefeller Center, the plaza opposite the Plaza will now try being more like the Louvre. By fall, a glass cube 32 by 32 by 32 feet will be set like a jumbo gemstone into the middle of the plaza of the General Motors Building at 767 Fifth Avenue. From the outside, the cube will appear empty. But inside will be a circular glass stairway and a cylindrical elevator leading to a 25,000-square-foot underground space.
2/27/2005	Build Me a River	The Hudson River Valley is not all sludge and smokestacks anymore, but neither is it pristine. Like the river itself, which reverses its flow with the tides, the region is slowly changing direction. Communities that turned their backs on the Hudson generations ago are now reclaiming the long-abused waterfront for a post-industrial age. It is hard work, and progress is piecemeal. There is no overarching strategy. Towns and villages are working with developers on various projects, some better than others. The best will be those enriched by a sense of history, an abundance of ambition and a touch of dreamy audacity.
2/23/2005	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: G.M. To Sell New Model	The General Motors Corporation said it would begin Chinese sales of a model developed by its South Korean affiliate. Shanghai General Motors, a venture between General Motors and China's largest carmaker, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, will start selling the Chevrolet Epica in April, it said in a statement. It did not give a sales goal. General Motors is using models developed by its affiliates under its own brand as it seeks to introduce new models faster in China. The Chevrolet Epica was based on a model developed by G.M.-Daewoo Auto and Technology, in which G.M. has a 42.1 percent stake.
2/22/2005	Building Autos With the Same DNA; Saab's New S.U.V. Has a Lot in Common With Buick, GMC and Isuzu	Is the 9-7X the first sport utility vehicle from Saab, or is it a Chevy TrailBlazer dressed up to look Swedish? The 9-7X, which is to come out this spring, will be roughly the same size and shape as a TrailBlazer, and for that matter, a GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier and Isuzu Ascender. It will roll off the same production line as the TrailBlazer, Envoy, Rainier and Ascender at a General Motors plant in Moraine, Ohio. All five S.U.V.'s share a pickup truck frame, the same engines, a similar sheet-metal design and many of the same parts, but the Saab has a base price of $38,270, about $11,000 higher than the TrailBlazer.
2/21/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Technology; A Curious Fluid and an Electric Jolt Deliver a Magic Carpet Ride	IF you can remember back to grade-school science class, you may recall the amazement of seeing what a horseshoe magnet does to a pile of iron filings, arranging the powder in orderly patterns and holding it neatly in place. That is a fair approximation of what happens inside the shock absorbers of some recent cars from General Motors, including the Buick Lucerne, Chevrolet Corvette and several Cadillacs.
2/20/2005	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Cadillac STS; A Better-Behaved Cadillac, Thanks to a Kick in the Rear	WHO can say when Cadillac began its long descent from Standard of the World to the velvet underground, but a notable waypoint was General Motors' decision a decade ago to phase out almost all of its rear-drive passenger cars. After years of shadowboxing, G.M. no longer had the heart even to pretend it could fight off the best cars from Europe. While front drive has its advantages, including space efficiency and better bad-weather traction, there are good reasons you don't find it in Autobahn rockets from BMW or Mercedes, or in sports cars like G.M.'s own Corvette. Sending a lot of power to the wheels that steer makes for twitchy handling and lower performance limits.
2/20/2005	A Shiny Prize (With a String Attached)	The good news: Marta Caiza of Corona, Queens, won a new car. One minor detail: it's in Ecuador.
2/14/2005	G.M. Will Pay $2 Billion To Sever Ties to Fiat	General Motors said on Sunday that it would pay Fiat $2 billion so that it would not be forced to take over Fiat's ailing auto business, resolving a dispute between the two that had threatened to become a court battle. The companies also dissolved a five-year-old industrial partnership in which they jointly produced engines and transmissions in Europe and Latin America and jointly purchased parts, though they said they would continue to cooperate in some areas.
2/14/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; Like the Jeep, Toyota's FJ Is Much Loved	IN South America it is called El Macho for its rugged looks and go-anywhere capability. Across the Australian outback, it is known as the ''troopie'' for its versatility in hauling people -- soldiers or civilians -- and cargo over extreme terrain. Safari guides in Africa, miners in Canada and farmers in California all have relied on it for decades. The Toyota Land Cruiser was conceived in the years following World War II, when Japanese companies urgently needed products to sell in export markets. Modeled after American military jeeps and British Land Rovers, the Land Cruiser models produced from 1954-84 have reached collectible status, acquiring a devoted following among restorers and off-road enthusiasts.
2/13/2005	No Democracy on These Ballots	PRESIDENT BUSH has been preaching the benefits of democracy to people throughout the Middle East. But back home, corporate executives and securities regulators are making it clear they do not believe that what is good for Iraqis will be good for General Motors -- or any other public company. The notion that the majority of shareholders should rule is still treated as a quaint one, at best, in most American boardrooms. Just ask Emil Rossi, who is so hard-headed that he thinks companies should adopt changes that receive more than half of the votes at annual meetings.
2/12/2005	G.M. ENDS PRESCRIPTION DEAL WITH WALGREEN	The General Motors Corporation has decided its employee health plans will largely stop covering prescriptions filled at Walgreen drugstores. The two companies have been at odds since last year, when G.M. began requiring employees to buy drugs for chronic conditions like high cholesterol through the mail. Such arrangements hurt pharmacies like Walgreen but save money for employers like G.M., which has said the mail-order program could cut its prescription drug costs by $80 million a year. Walgreen has strongly opposed the shift to mail order, and in 2003 said it would not sign new contracts with companies that have mandatory mail-order drug policies for their employees. Fearing that Walgreen would drop it as a customer, G.M. decided to stop doing business with Walgreen as a pre-emptive measure. A Walgreen spokesman, Michael Polzin, said G.M.'s decision came as a surprise Jeremy W. Peters (NYT)
2/3/2005	G.M.-Fiat Dispute Unresolved as Talks End	Fiat and General Motors moved another step closer to a courtroom battle Wednesday after talks failed to produce an agreement on the validity of Fiat's option to sell its unprofitable and debt-burdened auto unit to G.M. The formal negotiation period, which began Dec. 16, ended at midnight Tuesday without resolution, Fiat said. Both companies are now free to go to court to resolve the dispute, with the case heard in New York.
2/2/2005	In a Tough Month for Autos, Ford Takes the Biggest Fall	Month after month, Detroit continues to lose American customers to Asian competitors. Last month, it was the Ford Motor Company that lost the most, with sales falling 4.9 percent in January compared with the same month a year earlier, Ward's AutoInfoBank reported Tuesday. And financial analysts are beginning to worry about the sales pace of some of Ford's new products.
1/31/2005	G.M. Will Make Some Options Standard	General Motors said yesterday that it would make rollover prevention systems and emergency aids like OnStar assistance standard equipment in every North American vehicle. The electronic stability-control system, now in 20 percent of G.M. sport utility vehicles, will be in all S.U.V.'s and vans by the end of 2007 and all passenger vehicles by 2010, a company statement said. The OnStar assistance system, now standard in about a third of G.M. vehicles, will be standard in all North American models in 2007.
1/30/2005	Hauling a Load of Attitude	TESTED: 2005 Hummer H2 SUT. WHAT IS IT? 5-passenger, 4-door sport utility with an open cargo bed. HOW MUCH? $52,845 base; $58,475 as tested with upgraded interior, CD changer, XM Satellite Radio, brush guards and chrome accents. WHAT MOVES IT? 6-liter pushrod V-8 (325 horsepower); four-speed automatic; full-time four-wheel drive. HOW THIRSTY? With a loaded weight exceeding 8,500 pounds, federal mileage ratings are not required. I averaged 12 m.p.g. in mostly highway driving, on regular-grade gasoline. SINCE pickups are highly popular and Hummers still have some aggressive street appeal, it makes sense that General Motors would extend the Hummer line with a sort-of pickup version called the H2 SUT (for sport utility truck).
1/25/2005	Executive for Home Depot	Home Depot announced yesterday that it had hired Roger W. Adams, an advertising executive at the General Motors Corporation, as its senior vice president for marketing, effective Feb. 7. Mr. Adams, 48, joins Home Depot after serving for a year as executive director for corporate advertising, marketing and customer relationship management at G.M. Before that, Mr. Adams was general manager of the Buick, Pontiac and GMC division of the automaker.
1/25/2005	One More Week of Talks In G.M.-Fiat Standoff	General Motors and Fiat will conclude settlement talks over their complex and fractured alliance on Feb. 1, the two companies said Monday. What happens on Feb. 2 remains to be seen. The companies are locked in a standoff over Fiat's struggling automotive business. Under the terms of a broad partnership agreement struck in 2000, Fiat negotiated the right, which went into effect on Monday, to sell its auto business to G.M., with the right lasting through the decade.
1/24/2005	MediaTalk; Web Surfers Crack G.M.'s Mystery Ad	Can an advertising campaign based on a teaser survive after its secret has been let out? The marketing team at General Motors hopes so, after some Web surfers spoiled a national promotion that was intended to gradually reveal a secret message.
1/20/2005	G.M. Reports Sharp Drop in Quarterly Profit	General Motors said Wednesday that soaring health care costs and continuing problems with its European division caused its fourth-quarter profits to fall by more than a third. The company said it did not expect its performance in the current quarter to be much better. The quarter is ''off to a bit of a slow start, although we have not changed our view for the full year,'' said John Devine, the chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts and reporters. He said the quarter would be ''break-even or better.''
1/16/2005	The Stars Aren't Out at Detroit's Big Show	THE North American International Auto Show opened last week with the expected hype and hyperbole, but without the usual frisson of excitement. If the 2005 show seems subdued -- which was the general view among analysts and people with industry ties who had gathered for press previews before the official opening yesterday -- there are plenty of reasons.
1/14/2005	G.M. Forecasts a Decline in Its Earnings for 2005	General Motors said Thursday that its earnings would fall this year because of rising health care costs and slowing profits at its financing division. ''We obviously are pushing hard in '05 but we're not pleased,'' said John Devine, G.M.'s chief financial officer, at an annual meeting with financial analysts. ''We expect to get back on track in '06 and '07,'' he added.
1/12/2005	Trying to Bring Back Head-Turners at Ford	Peter Horbury changed the shape of Volvos from boxes to curves. Now the Ford Motor Company is giving Mr. Horbury, a 54-year-old British designer, a much larger makeover project: get Americans excited about Fords, Lincolns and Mercurys. A year ago, Ford said that 2004 would be the year of the car and that it would boldly redesign its passenger lineup. General Motors also said it was rededicated to design. But after a year in which the Big Three's share of the domestic market fell below 60 percent for the first time despite heavy spending on rebates and financing offers, it is clear that Detroit has a way to go.
1/9/2005	G.M.&#039;s Hydrogen-Powered &#039;Sequel&#039; Audio Slide Show	Chris Borroni-Bird, the lead designer of the Sequel, talks about the innovative hydrogen fuel call concept car from G.M.
1/9/2005	In Detroit, the Dogs Have Their Day	CUE the orchestra to strike up ''Tomorrow.'' The 2005 Detroit auto show may resemble nothing so much as a production of ''Annie,'' as the industry's neglected offspring, ragtag orphans and homely stepchildren get their moments in the spotlight. The emphasis at this year's show, which begins press previews today and opens to the public Saturday at Cobo Center in downtown Detroit, will be on brands and divisions in need of at least a shampoo and a shower, and in some cases an extreme makeover.
1/9/2005	George Jetson, Meet the Sequel	THE Sequel is totally cool. General Motors' latest hydrogen car prototype, called the Sequel, will be unveiled today at a press preview of the North American International Auto Show here. It is a car unlike any other and a glimpse of a possible, very different, automotive future. Most important, it runs on a hydrogen fuel cell, so its only tailpipe emission is water vapor, not the smog-forming pollutants and greenhouse gases that come out of gasoline-powered cars.
1/7/2005	Fitting In the Odd Piece	In case you've forgotten, Saturn's memorable first wave of commercials in 1990 promised a different kind of company. The ads showed autoworkers brimming with sunny optimism at Saturn's newfangled factory in Tennessee, a world away from Detroit. Saturn was a pet project of General Motors' chairman and chief executive of the 1980's, Roger B. Smith. It promised a different kind of car with a plastic, dent-resistant body, built with the latest manufacturing techniques and sold without haggling. It was just the kind of out-of-the-box idea that was going to win back hundreds of thousands of car buyers flocking to Toyota and Honda.
1/7/2005	Enter the Chinese Dragon, Now Bearing Minicars	After a year in which dozens of Chinese corporations went global with their plans, the Chery Automobile Company has joined them with an ambitious gamble to become the first Chinese automaker to sell cars in the United States. The company announced this week that beginning in 2007 it would export 250,000 cars to the United States in partnership with Visionary Vehicles, an auto import and distribution company based in New York. Visionary Vehicles said the Chery cars would be 30 percent cheaper than comparable models sold in the United States and would offer a 10-year warranty.
1/5/2005	3 Japanese Carmakers Gain Against Big 3 in the U.S.	For Japanese automakers, last year brought feast or famine in the United States. Toyota, Honda and Nissan's American sales continued to surge in December, according to figures released Tuesday by the automakers, as the companies made further inroads against the Big Three domestic manufacturers, particularly General Motors and Ford Motor.
12/30/2004	Outsourcing Design	Two years ago, Medtronic, best known for its pacemakers, introduced the CareLink, a home-use wireless gadget that can transmit relevant data from implanted devices. Its engineers designed the original monitor. But when it comes out with the next version, another company will design it. ''We'd rather use our in-house people on really new core products,'' said Reggie Groves, vice president of patient management.
12/29/2004	COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Manhattan; A Record Deal Now Looks Like a Good One, Too	It has been 15 months since the record-breaking sale of the General Motors Building in Manhattan for $1.4 billion became the talk of the real estate industry. Many people wondered at the time if the buyer, Harry Macklowe, had paid too much for the structure, a 50-story off-white marble office building across Fifth Avenue from the Plaza Hotel. No one is wondering anymore.
12/28/2004	New Executive Named For G.M. Account	Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe, said yesterday that it had named Tor Myhren as executive vice president and executive creative director for the General Motors account managed by Chemistri in Troy, Mich., the Burnett unit dedicated to handling G.M. in North America. He assumes some duties that had been handled by Gary Topolewski, who stepped down as chairman and chief creative officer at Chemistri to join the Troy office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.
12/26/2004	'Magic' Fuel-Saving Buses Fall a Bit Short on Wonders	The fleet of hybrid buses that General Motors promised would save Seattle more than 750,000 gallons of fuel a year will actually save less than half that amount, according to the fleet operator, and although G.M. said the hybrid buses would show a fuel economy improvement of up to 60 percent, the savings around the country appear to be in the range of 10 percent to 20 percent, transit managers say. General Motors, which got a late start bringing hybrid technology to market in cars, has argued that buses are a better vehicle to convert to hybrid drive, because they are used more heavily than cars.
12/24/2004	Tough Times At U.S. Makers Of Auto Parts	So many jobs have been cut by the auto parts giant Delphi that workers sound almost existential about their future. ''I think about it,'' said Robert Pepin, 47, a forklift driver walking to his car after his shift on a recent frigid afternoon at the Delphi East plant in Flint, Mich. ''It worries me. But, hey, the sun comes up, the sun goes down.''
12/22/2004	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Dec. 14 about plans by General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to collaborate on hybrid electric vehicles misspelled the surname of the executive vice president for product development at Chrysler, who commented on the development. He is Eric Ridenour, not Ridenhour.
12/21/2004	G.M. Combines Duties At Universal McCann	The European division of General Motors has consolidated the media planning and buying duties for car and truck brands like Chevrolet, Opel, Saab and Vauxhall in 45 markets at Universal McCann, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $700 million; Universal McCann was already handling about $500 million of that. The decision came after a four-month review among Universal McCann and four others on the General Motors European media-agency roster: Carat, part of the Aegis Group; Initiative, also part of Interpublic; OMD, part of the Omnicom Group; and Starcom, part of the Starcom MediaVest division of the Publicis Groupe. Initiative continues to handle media duties for General Motors in Britain.
12/19/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Pontiac G6; In Case You Didn't Get One From Oprah	YOU'D swoon, too, if somebody gave you a new car. But if you were in a dealer's showroom rather than on the set of a television show, and if you had to dig deep into your own pocket to get your name on the title, would the new Pontiac G6 elicit the same giddy enthusiasm? The G6 was, of course, the subject of one of the most lavish -- and best publicized -- auto marketing gimmicks ever: on Sept. 13, Oprah Winfrey presented keys to 276 people in her studio audience. Scenes of ecstactic recipients were played for days on national television (and again, later, with follow-up stories about the hefty tax bills that await those who were gifted).
12/19/2004	Counselors Are Standing By At the Aztek Help Center	HAVING accomplished the goal of provoking nonstop hilarity in the world's styling ateliers, the Pontiac Aztek -- Road Kill magazine's sport futility vehicle of the year -- will soon be even more invisible than it is now. It will, in fact, be dead.
12/18/2004	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: G.M. To Sell A Buick	General Motors will start selling the Buick Royaum model in China next March. The new model will be initially available in more than 20 cities including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, said Shanghai General Motors, a joint venture between General Motors and China's largest carmaker, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. The Royaum will compete with Volkswagen's Audi A6 sedans, which start at about 270,000 yuan ($32,600) and sell for as much as 534,900 yuan each.
12/15/2004	G.M.-Fiat Talks Fail to Resolve Rift Over Partnership Agreement	The high-stakes standoff between General Motors and Fiat over the terms of a 2000 partnership moved a step closer to the courtroom on Tuesday. The chief executives of the two companies met Tuesday night in Europe but were not able to resolve their dispute, according to a person close to the talks.
12/14/2004	G.M. and Daimler to Work Jointly on Hybrid Engine	The prospects for hybrid electric vehicles were bolstered Monday when General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, two automakers long skeptical about hybrids, said they would develop them by working together. The two companies have already been separately developing hybrids and said they had been in discussions since last year. They agreed to jointly develop a compact hybrid system that saves gas on both the highway and in the city, where today's hybrids are more efficient. It will also be designed for full-size trucks and for use with diesel and gasoline engines.
12/12/2004	IN THE REGION/Westchester; Upscale Town Houses at a Rare Site	AFTER a four-year zoning struggle with village officials over the future of 3.4 acres along the Hudson River, the developer Martin Ginsburg has begun construction of a 44-unit luxury town house community here. The condominium complex, Ichabod's Landing, is the first of two new developments about to go up along this village's riverfront.
12/12/2004	Fuel Cells in the Deep Freeze	AMONG the many hurdles to be overcome before we're all driving fuel-cell cars with exhaust that is baby's-breath-pure -- superyacht purchase prices, an almost nonexistent refueling network and some public concern about the wisdom of carrying hydrogen pressurized at 10,000 pounds per square inch -- is a more basic challenge: winter. Fuel cells work by producing electricity from hydrogen, with water as a byproduct. The electricity powers a motor that propels the car.
12/11/2004	Delphi to Eliminate an Additional 8,500 Jobs	Delphi, the world's largest auto parts maker, said Friday that it would cut nearly 5 percent of its work force, or 8,500 jobs, as it copes with the declining fortunes of its largest customer, General Motors, and the rising costs of raw materials, like steel. Delphi, which is based in the Detroit suburb of Troy, has already cut about 9,000 workers this year. The new round of cuts will come in both the United States and Europe. Delphi and other suppliers have been shifting their work forces to China, Mexico and other regions with lower labor costs.
12/10/2004	Fiat Vows to Defend Its Right to Sell Car Unit to G.M.	Sergio Marchionne, the new chief executive of the Fiat Group, said Thursday that his company would vigorously defend its right to sell its auto business to General Motors, a move G.M. has said it will contest in court if need be. Fiat won that right as part of a broad partnership with G.M. in 2000. But with Fiat's auto business saddled with roughly $10 billion in debt, and with G.M. itself struggling, the prospect of a sale is of increasing concern to G.M.'s management and Wall Street.
12/9/2004	G.M. WILL OFFER REBATES IN EFFORT TO REVERSE SALES DECLINE	General Motors, whose sales fell 16 percent in November, will offer rebates as high as $5,500, according to Autodollars.com, a company that collects data on vehicle discounts. Starting tomorrow, the company will promote the sale for buyers of 2004 and 2005 models who use General Motors' finance unit for car loans, Autodollars.com said. General Motors told dealers about the offer on Tuesday. General Motors has been using promotions like 72-month loans and a guaranteed interest rates on future purchases to stem a sales decline. Autodollars.com, an independently owned company in Manchester, Mich., collects incentive details from automakers and dealers and redistributes them to consumers.
12/9/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: G.M. And Union Reach Deal	General Motors will refrain from forced layoffs and plant shutdowns at its money-losing European operations, according to Klaus Franz, G.M. Europe's top worker representative in Rsselsheim, near Frankfurt. He said the European management and employee representatives had agreed on an accord late on Tuesday while negotiating the carmaker's reorganization plans. The carmaker said in October that it planned to cut 12,000 of its 63,000 employees, focusing on the Adam Opel division, to save 500 million euros over the next two years. G.M. officials declined to comment, but details are to be announced today. Petra Kappl (NYT)
12/8/2004	Automakers Sue to Block Emissions Law In California	Toyota, General Motors and seven other automakers filed suit on Tuesday to block California's new greenhouse gas regulation, which was approved by the state in its final form in September. The suit sets up a battle between automakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Although Mr. Schwarzenegger is a fan of the Hummer, an S.U.V. with prodigious greenhouse gas emissions, he has promised nonetheless to defend the regulation, which was signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis.
12/7/2004	G.M.'S HUMMER H2 IS OBJECT OF SAFETY INVESTIGATION	Regulators are investigating 2003 and 2004 Hummer H2 models after four drivers said a suspension failure led them to lose control of their vehicles. In three of the cases, including a test drive in 2002 by Mark Glover, the auto editor of The Sacramento Bee, the failure caused one of the Hummer's wheels to come off. None of the four Hummers was driven off-road ''or exposed to other abusive driving conditions,'' according to a summary of the investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Mr. Glover's wheel detached while he was driving in a parking lot, according to a story he wrote in December 2002. ''My experience was probably a fluke,'' he wrote at the time. He was not available for comment yesterday. A spokesman for General Motors, which sells the Hummer, said the company was cooperating with the investigation. Danny Hakim (NYT)
12/6/2004	For an Auto Plant, Days of Decline	Last week's announcement that the sprawling General Motors plant in this industrial city will close should have been a sad, almost funereal event. It is, after all, the last auto manufacturing plant in the state. It has been a source of thousands of jobs going back generations. But news of the closing was more about symbolism than true tragedy. Though nearly 800 plant workers will lose their jobs, they have suspected the layoffs could happen since 1992, and their union contracts leave them well taken care of. The manufacturing sector of the statewide and regional economy has been hemorrhaging jobs for decades. In the end, Linden's loss is simply the period at the end of a sentence that began a long time ago.
12/6/2004	As a Death Foretold, a Plant's Closing Causes Little Pain	AMERICAN automakers see China as the world's biggest growth opportunity, even though the country's auto sales boom has slowed in 2004. Despite the slowdown, China propelled General Motors' Asian operations to earn more than G.M.'s three other geographic regions combined in the third quarter. While that was partly a sign of the company's struggles in the brutally competitive landscape in North America and Europe, it also explained the industry's bullishness on China.
12/2/2004	Ford and G.M. Sales Slide Despite Generous Rebates	Despite a crop of new car models and a still-generous supply of rebates, sales fell for the Ford Motor Company and General Motors in November. Both companies said they would cut production in the first quarter of 2005 from levels of the same quarter this year, the latest troubling sign for job growth in Michigan and other states where the companies operate. G.M. said Tuesday that it was accelerating a plan to stop production at a plant in Linden, N.J., and would lay off nearly 1,000 workers at the plant early next year.
12/2/2004	G.M. Acted on S.U.V.	To the Editor: Re ''Despite Defect, G.M. Keeps Selling S.U.V.'' (Business Day, Nov. 23): Saturn has been built on the promise of outstanding customer care, which is why we have taken multiple steps to communicate with our owners and potential owners about the recent voluntary customer service campaign involving 2002-04 Saturn Vue sport utility vehicles.
12/1/2004	G.M. Plans Layoffs at Truck Plant in Linden	General Motors announced on Tuesday that it was laying off nearly 1,000 factory workers at its Linden, N.J., truck plant and ending production of one of Chevrolet's best-known models, the Blazer. The layoff, scheduled for early next year, was originally anticipated for summer 2005 but was pushed up because of sagging truck sales.
11/30/2004	Judge Dismisses Big Rights Suit On Apartheid	A federal judge in New York dismissed a human rights suit yesterday against 35 major corporations that did business in South Africa under apartheid, dealing a blow to rights lawyers who have sought to use an 18th-century law to punish international companies that operated under abusive systems. The ruling, by Judge John E. Sprizzo of Federal District Court in Manhattan, came in response to suits originally brought in 2002 by three separate groups of plaintiffs in eight different federal courts across the country. They argued that the corporations, most of which are American, violated international law by actively helping to support the apartheid system.
11/27/2004	This Year, Ontario May Pass Michigan In Making Vehicles	Michigan has been the heart of the auto industry since Henry Ford started mass-producing the Model T a century ago, but the Midwestern state is poised to be surpassed by Ontario. The Canadian province is on course to pass Michigan this year and become the biggest auto-producing state or province in North America, according to Ward's Automotive, which tracks auto production data.
11/26/2004	A 60's Star Is Reborn	ON a hot summer day more than three years ago, my wife and I were driving west on Route 78 in New Jersey when in the rearview mirror of our black 1964 Lincoln Continental I saw a motorcycle speeding up behind me. The motorcycle raced past us in the fast lane, then slowed and pulled up next to the Lincoln. The big man at the controls of the bike smiled and nodded his approval, mouthing ''nice car'' before hitting the throttle. As it turned out, the biker was headed to the same party we were. We approached him as he stood by the table full of hamburgers, hot dogs and grilled corn. ''Cowboy Curtis,'' I said, extending my hand, ''I thought that was you on the motorcycle.''
11/23/2004	Despite Defect, G.M. Keeps Selling S.U.V.	Joram Rauchwerger, a 56-year-old postal worker in Tulsa, Okla., recently broke his 22-year-old vow never to buy another car made by General Motors. To say the least, he regrets the decision. Mr. Rauchwerger bought a new Saturn Vue, a small sport utility vehicle, on Oct. 11, only to discover later, by chance, that the Vue's suspension system collapsed during rollover testing performed by the government over the summer. In August, G.M. said it would voluntarily recall all of the roughly 250,000 Saturn Vues on the road in the United States and Canada. The swift action by G.M. bolstered Saturn's reputation for adept customer care and quieted news reports about the problem.
11/21/2004	The Magnet Magnet	I pulled up at a stoplight behind a Hummer with a ''Support Our Troops'' ribbon affixed to it. While I do not believe that oil was the ulterior motive for invading Iraq, I nevertheless found the Hummer a rather incongruous vehicle on which to display such a message. Marta Bowman Minneapolis
11/17/2004	Jeep May Try to Revive Market for Smaller Trucks	The Chrysler Group said Tuesday that it was considering building its first new Jeep pickup truck in more than a decade as part of a broader effort by automakers to rekindle interest in small to midsize pickups. The company, a division of DaimlerChrysler, unveiled sketches of a prototype Jeep pickup, called the Gladiator, that is modeled after Jeep's signature sport utility vehicle, the Wrangler.
11/15/2004	Study Finds Fault With Many Cars' Head Restraints	A new study of automobile head restraints found that most do not do a good job of protecting passengers from whiplash in low-speed collisions. The study, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and released on Sunday, examined 97 types of head restraints in cars sold in the United States, and concluded that three-fourths of the restraints provided either poor or marginal protection. Only eight restraints earned a rating of good: three in Volvo models, two in Saabs, one in the Jaguar S-Type, one in Volkswagen's New Beetle and one in the Subaru Impreza.
11/14/2004	Does Your Portfolio Need a Dividend Kick?	INVESTORS who shun stocks that dole out seemingly trivial dividends of 1 or 2 percent may want to take a second look. For more than two decades, dividend payers, often pokey but stable enterprises, have generally done a better job than other companies when it comes to enriching their shareholders. This year is no different. Through Thursday, the dividend-paying stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a total return of 13.8 percent, according to S.&P., versus a gain of 3.8 percent for the nonpayers -- often flashier, high-tech companies that aim for huge growth. Indeed, since 1980, a period that embraces the longest bull market in history, dividend payers have outperformed nonpayers by almost three percentage points a year, on average, according to Howard Silverblatt, a market equity analyst at S.&P.
11/12/2004	More G.M. and Ford S.U.V.'s To Get Anti-Rollover Systems	General Motors and the Ford Motor Company said on Thursday that they would significantly expand the use of technologies aimed at reducing the risk of rollovers in their sport utility vehicles. G.M. said it would offer electronic stability control systems, which apply brake pressure to help a driver maintain control, on most of its S.U.V.'s over the next year. The company said that in December it would begin making stability control a standard feature on most of the large 2005 S.U.V.'s that do not already have it, including the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon. Next year, it will add the midsize S.U.V.'s, including the Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy and the Hummer H3.
11/11/2004	Washington Station Offers Gas, Snacks and Hydrogen	At an ordinary filling station about a mile east of the Capitol that has the usual selection of regular, premium and diesel at the pumps and chewing gum and soda next to the cash register, Shell Oil and General Motors are offering hydrogen. For $1.99 a kilogram, drivers can choose liquid hydrogen, chilled to nearly 300 degrees below zero, or gaseous hydrogen, at 500 pounds per square inch of pressure. That amount of hydrogen, when burned, produces about the same amount of energy as a gallon of regular unleaded gas, which was also selling for $1.99 on Wednesday.
11/11/2004	G.M. enlists a TV dispenser of monetary advice to pitch 'Lock 'n' Roll' as the way to finance a car.	SUZE ORMAN wants to tell you about a can't-miss car deal. Ms. Orman is a financial planner, CNBC talk show host, motivational speaker and best-selling author of such books as ''The Courage to Be Rich,'' and now, she has been tapped by General Motors to pitch the company's latest marketing promotion, which G.M. is calling ''Lock 'n' Roll.''
11/10/2004	Buy a G.M. Car at 0% Now, Get the Same Deal in 5 Years	Can fear of the Fed sell cars? General Motors has a new pitch for car shoppers to coincide with an expected rate hike Wednesday from the Federal Reserve. G.M.'s program, called ''Lock 'n' Roll,'' will give shoppers who buy a car and qualify for zero percent or low financing rates the same deal on any new G.M. purchase before the present financing runs out.
11/7/2004	Mild-Hybrid Pickups: The 10% Solution	THE full-size Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid pickup offers few visual clues to its status as a flagship environmental product for General Motors. It is, frankly, a really big extended-cab truck, not the kind of vehicle that wins Greenpeace achievement awards. It looks like a gas guzzler even in bright green paint. This is G.M.'s first hybrid -- the GMC truck division offers a similar version of its Sierra pickup -- and it wants the world to know. The 2004 version went virtually incognito, with hybrid labels only on the sides, but for 2005 there are additional badges on the dashboard and the tailgate. Still, no one will mistake this burly truck for a Toyota Prius.
11/7/2004	Can General Motors Design a Better Future?	ROBERT A. LUTZ settled into a Chevrolet Cobalt in the basement garage of General Motors' secretive, sprawling design center just north of Detroit. ''This is where the game is really played,'' he said, scanning the dashboard for imperfections. To critics, however, the question is how well Mr. Lutz, G.M.'s 72-year-old vice chairman and head of product development, is playing. Take, for example, the Cobalt itself. When it hits showrooms in December, G.M. will sell it as a sporty compact: television ads already suggest it is the Corvette's baby brother. But it could just as easily be described as nondescript and inoffensive, especially when parked next to the company's flashy Cadillac STS sedan.
11/7/2004	BENEFITS	Kitchen Art TOMORROW -- An auction of works by John Baldessari, Louise Bourgeois and others at the Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, will benefit the artists whose work is sold and will pay part of the fees the Kitchen will pay to artists and performers in its 2004-5 productions. Drinks and hors d'oeuvres at 6, with the auction at 8. Tickets, $175, from (212)255-5793, ext. 29. Aiding the Disabled WEDNESDAY -- Mario M. Cuomo will be among those honored at a black-tie dinner at the Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, to aid the YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities Network and its programs for young people including early intervention, education, health care, employment and residential services. Drinks at 6:30 and dinner at 7:30, with dancing to the music of Daddy Pop. Tickets, $500, from (212)273-6192.

11/5/2004	MOODY'S DROPS G.M.'S DEBT RATING ONE LEVEL	Moody's Investor Service said yesterday that it had lowered its debt rating for the General Motors Corporation one level to Baa2, two steps above noninvestment grade, because of competition from Asia and costs to reduce European losses. Moody's also cut the rating of the automaker's credit unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, one level, to Baa1 from A3. Moody's said the move affected $150 billion in debt. Moody's said last month that it was reviewing its ratings of General Motors, citing the effect of unsold vehicles in North America, losses in Europe and rising health care costs on company profit.
11/1/2004	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; Registered as Independents, in Corvairs	IF you are among the 1 or 2 percent of American voters who, polls indicate, plan to cast ballots for Ralph Nader tomorrow, you can thank Edward N. Cole for affording you the opportunity. Neither an idealistic college student nor one of the canvassers who worked to secure Mr. Nader's access to the presidential ballot, Mr. Cole, the president of General Motors from 1967 to 1974, is widely regarded as the father of the Chevrolet Corvair.
10/31/2004	G.M. vs. Toyota: This Time, the Hare May Win	GENERAL MOTORS is the world's largest carmaker, but it is not even close to being the most valuable. At current prices, you could buy all of the company's shares if you had a spare $22 billion; Toyota Motor, by contrast, which makes about 30 percent fewer vehicles, would set you back about $140 billion. In a choice between Toyota and General Motors shares, many investors have bid up Toyota's sticker price out of faith in its ability to operate more efficiently and profitably than its American rival. Analysts say that this results from financial burdens facing G.M., as well as from better production methods and better cars that Toyota has developed over the years.
10/29/2004	G.M. Plans 10,000 Temporary Layoffs	General Motors said Thursday that it would temporarily lay off more than 10,000 workers for one to four weeks early next year at five plants that mostly produce sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The layoffs, at plants in Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin, come on the heels of G.M.'s second quarterly loss in North American automotive operations in a decade, which it reported in its third-quarter earnings results earlier this month.
10/27/2004	To Say Luxury in Chinese, Start by Sitting in the Back	RACE on Sunday, sell on Monday. For a half century, that is how Porsche has been selling cars around the world. In China, though, the cars are sold differently, said Peter Vogel, the Porsche business development manager in China, leading the way along a thoroughfare here thronged with pedestrians, bicycles and rickshaws. ''First, very few Chinese follow racing,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''Formula 1 and Grand Prix are unknown to them.'' Second, he continued, you cannot really drive a Porsche in China the way you might drive it in Germany. ''Their roads aren't like the autobahn,'' he said.
10/27/2004	At the Beijing Auto Show, Signs of a Behemoth to Come	THE Beijing auto show is starting to look a lot like auto shows in Detroit or Frankfurt or Geneva, a sign of how China has become one of the world's great industrial powers. The idiosyncratic, locally built clunkers found in other developing countries, like the Ambassador cars of India, are nearly gone. In their place are sleek models made in China by practically all of the world's multinational automakers -- sedans from Honda, minivans from General Motors and sport utility vehicles from Toyota -- and a range of locally designed cars.
10/27/2004	A Hummer That's Slimmer And Cheaper	The Hummer is rumbling down-market. On Wednesday, General Motors will unveil a new Hummer that will be smaller, cheaper and less gas-hungry than its predecessors.
10/27/2004	For Them, a Car Is a Blank Canvas	WHY would a person spend more money on jazzing up his car than the car is worth, let alone spend many times more? Maybe it would be an exaggeration to say that there are as many reasons for doing so as there are kinds of hubcaps. But customizing addicts come to their passions in different ways. For some, it becomes their business as well as their obsession. Here are some examples of the breed. The Sacrifice Is Worth It CHRISTINA OCHOA -- 29, custom car shop owner in Wichita Falls, Tex. HER RIDE -- 1997 Honda Civic, bought new in December 1996. AMOUNT SPENT ON IMPROVEMENTS -- $30,000. HOW SHE GOT THE BUG -- ''I was the type of girl that liked to take care of my car, keep it cleaned and waxed,'' said Mrs. Ochoa. So when she bought her Civic, her husband, Alex, suggested she put special wheels on it. Next, she wanted tinted windows and a better stereo system. ''And from there I couldn't stop,'' she said. Adding things to the Civic (and her husband's car and bike customizing hobby) led the couple to open a customizing business in Wichita Falls. MY BIRTHDAY PRESENTS ARE CAR STUFF -- She improved her car rather than go on a honeymoon. She's proud of every detail and talks about those fillips the same way a fashionista coos over her newest Jimmy Choos. ''I love when I hear from people, 'I've never noticed that before, how long has that been on?' '' Mrs. Ochoa said. POINTS OF PRIDE -- The Civic has won 40 trophies at shows in Texas and throughout the South. The trophies are on display at AK Performance, the shop she and her husband own. DRIVING HABITS -- Mrs. Ochoa drives the car about twice a week. She usually stops at a parking lot to show it off. ''We don't cruise -- that leaves a lot of room for accidents to happen,'' she said. CAR VALUES -- To Mrs. Ochoa, improving her Civic is a way to prove to herself that her goals are reachable. She is trying to impart these lessons to her daughter, who is 2 and attended her first car show at 3 months. The Civic is a metaphor for Mrs. Ochoa's life, she said; like her marriage, she is not ready to trade in the Honda. She'll stick with both. The Old Pro JERRY ROMAN -- 66, custom car shop owner in Ohio. HIS (NEWEST) RIDE -- 2000 Cadillac Escalade; he also has a 70's Corvette with $200,000 of chrome work, he says. And Mr. Roman has the first car he ever customized, a 1953 Olds, complete with the television and turntable he installed in the ceiling. HOW HE GOT THE BUG -- In the late 50's, Mr. Roman, an auto body repairman, paid his employers to use their garage to customize his 1953 Oldsmobile Holiday Coupe. In 1960, he bought out his employer and started customizing Corvettes. Mr. Roman never finished painting the Olds, and he never drove it to see if the TV worked, either. Today it is on display in his showroom, Roman Chariot, in Cleveland. Mr. Roman owns another shop in Akron. WHY HE STILL LOVES DOING THIS -- After operating a successful business for 40 years, Mr. Roman says he still admires the pluck of the ''young fellow'' who tinkers with his car in his own garage. ''The kids paint everything on the interior; it only holds up for so long but they give it a good look,'' he said. After all, Mr. Roman used to be that young fellow and he knows where that passion can lead. HOW THE BUSINESS HAS CHANGED -- Today, Mr. Roman says, auto manufacturers are elbowing into the aftermarket accessories business, offering car enhancements through dealers. Nevertheless, local car dealers are some of Mr. Roman's best customers, he says. CAR VALUES -- The Escalade is Mr. Roman's marketing tool and ''guinea pig,'' where he tests all his new ideas. He drives it every day. Three weeks ago, another Escalade owner saw Mr. Roman's model and ordered $15,000 worth of similar accessories. For Love of the Road, and the Stares IMAN ALAVI -- 23, owns a computer game accessories company in Tomball, Tex. HIS RIDE -- 2002 BMW M3, bought in 2004 for $35,000. AMOUNT SPENT ON IMPROVEMENTS -- $42,000 (more are planned). HOW HE GOT THE BUG -- He has always loved cars, Mr. Alavi said. And the BMW is the fourth car he has customized. At 16, with the help of two friends, he rebuilt the engine and installed a stereo in his first car, a 1997 Corvette. When he wasn't fixing up that car, he spent a lot of time hanging around Progressive AutoSports, a car shop in Houston, getting ideas for improving his next ride. But today, between traveling for his business, System-Mods.com, and running the daily operations, Mr. Alavi doesn't do the car work himself. Instead he relies on Taza Zohar of Progressive AutoSports in Houston. WHY SPEND ALL THAT MONEY? -- ''Money is great, but you can only look at it for so long,'' said Mr. Alavi, who says fixing up the car is pure enjoyment. Mr. Alavi markets hardware that allows computer gamers to redesign their Xbox dashboards. Those same gamers show up at car shows, where Mr. Alavi plans to show off the car, especially the inside doors, which glow in neon blue with his company's logo when opened. DRIVING HABITS -- Fast. A new turbocharged engine is planned for the car, satisfying Mr. Alavi's desire for driving fast. As a street-racing teenager, he said that he accumulated 10 speeding tickets a year. ''I've been ticket-free for two and a half years,'' he said. ''I learned to slow down.''
10/26/2004	Resentment Toward G.M. Is Growing In Germany	Is General Motors jilting Germany for Poland because of the war in Iraq? A German politician suggested as much last week, saying in a radio interview that G.M.'s Opel division had shifted some auto production from its plants in Germany to a factory in Gliwice, Poland, to reward the Polish government for its support of the Bush administration.
10/21/2004	The Real Consequences of Pension Projections	When General Motors conducted its quarterly earnings teleconference last Thursday, the first question from Wall Street was not about Cadillac cars or Chevrolet trucks or the company's no-interest financing deals. It was about health care accounting. And that was before G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the auto supply giant Delphi disclosed this week that they were among six companies asked by the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide information as part of an inquiry into corporate pension and health care accounting practices.
10/20/2004	More Brazilian Drivers Turn to Ethanol	When Brazil's state-owned oil company announced this month that it was raising gasoline prices to keep up with the rising cost of crude oil, Gutemberg do Brasil Moreira barely blinked. Mr. Moreira is an oral surgeon who spends a good portion of his days battling traffic going to hospitals all over this sprawling metropolis. He drives a car that runs on either gasoline or ethanol, or any combination of the two. But with ethanol -- or alcohol, as most Brazilians call it -- selling at half the price of gasoline at the pump, Mr. Moreira does not waste any time deciding which fuel to use when filling up his three-month-old Volkswagen Fox.
10/20/2004	Ford Has Loss From Making Cars but Posts a Profit	The Ford Motor Company reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, but it lost money in its core business, making cars and trucks, for the second consecutive quarter. Ford, as well as General Motors and the auto supply giant Delphi, also said Tuesday that they had been asked to provide information to the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of an inquiry into accounting practices related to pension and health care expenses.
10/20/2004	S.E.C. Inquires Into Pension Accounting at Ford and G.M.	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that the federal government had asked them to provide information about how they account for their pension funds and retiree medical benefits, suggesting that a new inquiry into an area of accounting that has long troubled both investors and pension-rights advocates will cast a broad net. The two automakers joined the Delphi Corporation, which disclosed on Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had requested similar information. The commission is seeking e-mail messages and other documents that pertain to the actuarial assumptions that the companies have used since the year 2000 to calculate their pension values and other obligations to retirees.
10/19/2004	G.M. Workers in Germany Protest Job Cuts a 3rd Day	Just days after it announced deep job cuts in Europe, the General Motors Corporation is battling a wildcat strike at one of its biggest German auto plants, and a threat of wider disruptions. Workers at the Opel assembly plant in Bochum refused to work on Monday for the third day, blocking the entrance to the factory and brushing aside the pleas of German politicians to compromise.
10/19/2004	Chinese Automaker Plans Assembly Line in Malaysia	The Chery Automobile Company, a fast-growing Chinese automaker, said on Monday that it planned to assemble cars in Malaysia, a big overseas step for the expanding Chinese auto industry. But the move is likely to generate fresh controversy about Chinese protection of intellectual property. Chery has been at the center of disputes with General Motors and Volkswagen over whether it has copied their vehicle designs -- accusations that Chery has repeatedly denied.
10/15/2004	G.M., Missing Forecasts, Is Hurt by Loss On U.S. Autos	Sapped by everything from surging health care costs to a hemorrhaging European operation, General Motors reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday that were well below Wall Street's expectations, including a loss in its North American automotive business for only the second time in the last decade. The report represented gloomy economic news from one of the nation's largest companies and one with a considerable impact on Midwestern states that will be pivotal in next month's election, like Michigan and Ohio. After the earnings announcement, Standard & Poor's cut G.M.'s debt rating to its lowest investment grade. Fitch reduced G.M.'s debt rating on Wednesday.
10/15/2004	G.M., Struggling in Europe, Sets Big Job Cuts	Europe has been a cold place for American carmakers these last few years. On Thursday, the General Motors Corporation made clear just how cold, announcing it would eliminate up to 12,000 jobs, mostly in Germany, as it tries to breathe life into its business. The cuts, which amount to nearly a fifth of its European work force, are intended to save G.M. 500 million euros ($620 million) a year by 2006. The announcement set off a wave of angst in Germany, the home of G.M.'s Opel division. Auto workers are already in tense contract negotiations with Volkswagen.
10/10/2004	G.M. Hopes to Bring Home the Bling	TODAY'S urban street fashions go well beyond velour track suits, limited-edition Nikes and the big-bling theory. On the road, hip-hop style requires oversize wheels and ultra-low-profile tires. While these accessories -- ''dubs'' in street slang -- are hotter than ever, they also have downsides: the installation of wheels and tires that are much wider or bigger in diameter than the original factory equipment can compromise the antilock brakes and affect the traction control and electronic stability systems. That can make a top-heavy vehicle more prone to roll over.
10/10/2004	Cadillac Plays the Platinum Card	TESTED: Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum WHAT IS IT? A pimped-out version of General Motors' longest S.U.V. HOW MUCH? $70,155 as tested ('04 model). WHAT'S DIFFERENT? 20-inch chrome wheels; DVD navigation; two rear video screens with wireless headphones. WILL IT HAUL MY POSSE? WILL IT PULL MY YACHT? The ESV seats seven adults and tows up to 7,700 pounds. ALTERNATIVES: Base Escalade ESV, $59,015; base Chevrolet Suburban 1500 4WD, $41,675; Ford Excursion Limited Diesel, $50,485; Range Rover Westminster, $86,000. A FEW months ago, the rapper Snoop Dogg left this telephone message for Chrysler's chief executive: ''What I gotta do to get that brand new 300 up outta you?'' I can relate this incident today because Chrysler fearlessly chose to publicize it.
10/2/2004	Car Sales Up 5.6% in Month, With G.M. and Toyota in Lead	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent in September from last year, with General Motors and Toyota posting double-digit gains, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The strong September, which came after a disappointing August, was indicative of the roller coaster trend the industry, in particular the domestic automakers, has encountered for several months. Often, a sluggish sales month has been followed by a big surge as automakers come back with higher cash and financing incentives and more inventive marketing programs.
9/26/2004	On the Waterfront	TOMORROW, people who live in Tarrytown, Sleepy Hollow and nearby communities will have the chance to weigh in on the details of a proposed development on Tarrytown's waterfront known as the Ferry Landings project. Developers plan 128 units of housing on 30 acres and 250,000 square feet of new office and commercial space. While this project would revitalize a contaminated portion of the Tarrytown waterfront, proposes a relatively low number of housing units per acre and opens up access to the Hudson with a walking trail, several details warrant closer review and public comment.
9/20/2004	AUTOS ON MONDAY/ Twins Under the Skin, But Far From Identical	IN the late 1970's, some Oldsmobile owners were aghast to discover common Chevrolet engines in place of the Rocket V-8's they expected in their new Delta 88's. Some demanded a refund and many sued General Motors, Olds's parent, for misrepresentation. G.M. lawyers spent years reaching settlements with miffed buyers. Of course, automakers have long dipped into the corporate parts bin for items generally unseen by customers. Even the idea of borrowing a vehicle's entire structure is not new. The original Mustang -- Ford's most successful car in modern times -- arrived in 1964 as a staid Falcon that had been dressed up with a sexy body, a zippy interior and hot engines.
9/16/2004	Anticipating intense competition, carmakers tune up their images.	HAVE you heard about the presentation that agencies are making to automotive clients, encouraging them to spend more? Its title: ''Advertise. Because Oprah Can't Give Cars to Everyone.'' Of course, Madison Avenue will not actually make any such presentation as the 2005 model year gets under way. But the 276 new Pontiac G6 sport sedans that Oprah Winfrey presented to delighted members of her studio audience on Monday -- a product placement that cost General Motors more than $7 million -- are indicative of new initiatives by agencies and automakers as competition intensifies.
9/15/2004	Carmakers In for a Long Haul In Paying Retiree Health Care	Ernest Pusey is older than General Motors. At 109, he once helped build the Stovebolt Six, a heavy cast iron engine that propelled Chevrolets across America, but it has been nearly half a century since he retired from G.M. and moved to Florida. Today, he is one of 240 G.M. retirees or spouses over 100 years old. All of them are older than G.M. itself, which is four years from its centennial.
9/15/2004	G.M. Helps to Drive a Detroit Revival	The largest private landlord in downtown Detroit, the General Motors Corporation, is nearing the end of a major renovation of its riverfront headquarters complex that has significantly transformed one of the city's most iconic structures. In addition, G.M. has announced preliminary plans for a 25-acre mixed-use development on land it owns adjacent to the complex and is playing a major role in the city's effort to redevelop the mainly blighted riverfront into a mixed-use community that combines retail and residential space with public improvements like parks and marinas.
9/2/2004	G.M. and Ford to Cut Production	General Motors and Ford Motor said today that they would cut car and truck production in the fourth quarter by as much as 7 percent because vehicles were piling up unsold in inventory. Each company experienced a sharp drop in sales last month, along with the auto industry as a whole, new figures released today show. According to Ward's AutoInfoBank, the average number of new cars and light-duty trucks sold daily last month fell by 5.6 percent from August 2003.
8/27/2004	Sure, It's Pragmatic. But Stylish? The Minivan Is Getting a Makeover	Julie Blewitt once vowed she would never own a minivan. ''I grew up humiliated being chauffeured about in a wood-paneled station wagon,'' said Ms. Blewitt, 34, of Loveland, Colo. ''I swore I would never drive the modern-day equivalent.'' But a couple of children can dent such resolve. Earlier this summer, she and her husband competed at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan in the Minivan Summer Games, part of a promotion by DaimlerChrysler, in the auto industry's latest attempt to cast off the minivan's dowdy image.
8/22/2004	For Getting High While Hauling	TESTED: 2004 GMC Envoy XUV WHAT IS IT? 5-passenger midsize S.U.V. with retracting roof over cargo area. HOW MUCH? SLE 4x2, $32,140; SLE 4x4, $34,390 ('05 prices); $45,390 as tested, for '04 SLT with V-8, navigation system, premium stereo, XM Satellite Radio, adjustable pedals and other upgrades. SALES INCENTIVES: $4,500 rebate or interest-free financing on 2004 models; $1,000 rebate or special financing on 2005's. WHAT MOVES IT? 4.2-liter in-line 6 (275 horsepower) or 5.3-liter V-8 (290 horsepower); four-speed automatic transmission; rear- or four-wheel drive. HOW THIRSTY? E.P.A. ratings range from 14 m.p.g. city/19 m.p.g. highway (four-wheel-drive V-8) to 15/19 (rear-drive 6) . SAFETY: Antilock brakes; dual-stage air bags, optional side curtain air bags. AMERICA'S best-selling vehicles are pickups, and of course the last decade has brought a boom in sport utility vehicles. So a combination of the two -- burly S.U.V. up front, pickup bed in back -- would be a stroke of product genius and a guaranteed best-seller, right?
8/16/2004	People	John Middlebrook, North American vice president for marketing and advertising at General Motors, Detroit, was promoted to vice president for global sales, service and marketing, a new post, overseeing all of G.M.'s marketing initiatives worldwide.
8/8/2004	Drop-Ins Welcome	LYNNE NURKALA is the keeper of the maximum pothole. Ms. Nurkala, 27, is a wheel test engineer at General Motors' 4,000-acre proving grounds here, some 45 miles (and uncounted hundreds of potholes) northwest of downtown Detroit. Her title is not official, and her charge has a more prosaic name: Pothole No.3.
8/8/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Chevrolet Equinox; It's Not a Truck, but It Is a Chevy	IN its small way, the 2005 Equinox represents a breakthrough for a smaller Chevrolet. Neither a rebadged Suzuki, like the late, unlamented Tracker, nor a Daewoo in a bow tie, like the thrifty Aveo subcompact, the Equinox is one example among a wave of new Chevys that, in the words of its marketing team, constitutes ''an American Revolution.'' Well, maybe it is and maybe it is not. But revolutionary or not, the new sport wagon certainly is built on home-grown General Motors architecture, a half-foot-longer version of the platform used by the Saturn Vue. On the other hand, there is the matter of the V-6 engine, a venerable G.M. design built in China, and the transmission, made in Japan.
8/6/2004	G.M. Recalls S.U.V. and Moves to Protect Its Stock	General Motors, the world's largest automaker, took steps on Thursday to mitigate problems both under the hood and in its financial reports. John M. Devine, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said at an industry management conference here that the company would recall all the Saturn Vue sport utility vehicles it has made since their introduction in 2001. The announcement came a week after regulators said the vehicle's suspension had broken during new federal rollover tests.
8/5/2004	Gehry and M.I.T.: Click and Drive	Even steering wheels could become obsolete in the new concept car, above, proposed by researchers at the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in consultation with the architect Frank Gehry and General Motors. The team was led by Ryan Chin, a doctoral candidate in the media arts and sciences program, and William J. Mitchell, a professor of media arts and sciences. The car has casterlike wheels that would enable ''smart'' parallel parking. On-board transponders would find parking spaces. Thin-film display coatings on the exterior could show messages. And steering could be done by remote control, giving new meaning to the phrase ''I'll drive you to school.'' Mr. Chin said he hopes to build a prototype by 2006. BRADFORD McKEE
8/4/2004	Bargains Help Auto Industry Recover in July	Auto sales rebounded in July after a disappointing June, driven by hot products like the Toyota Sienna minivan and the Chrysler 300C sedan and by big incentives on sport utility vehicles, figures released on Tuesday showed. Ward's AutoInfoBank estimated that July's seasonally adjusted selling rate was 17.24 million units, a sharp increase from the 15.4 million-unit rate in June, the lowest in six years.
7/28/2004	Study Says Blacks Paid More for Honda Loans	A new study has found that black customers are almost twice as likely as whites to be charged a marked-up rate when they finance a purchase through the loan subsidiary of Honda Motor, and that on average, blacks are charged higher markups than whites. The study, covering nearly 400,000 people who borrowed from the American Honda Finance Corporation from June 1999 to March 2003, was conducted by Mark Cohen, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits against several automakers. His research has been at the center of those cases.
7/27/2004	Suspension Failure on Saturn S.U.V.'s in Rollover Tests Prompts Inquiry	The suspensions on two Saturn Vue sport utility vehicles broke during rollover tests performed by the government last month, causing the left rear wheels of the vehicles to collapse. The suspension failures occurred in separate tests of the two- and four-wheel-drive versions of the Vue, which is made by General Motors. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating why the failures occurred, according to a brief summary of the investigation posted late last week on the agency's Web site. The process often takes more than a year and must be completed before the agency orders a recall, if it so chooses.
7/25/2004	Catching Up to the Cost of Global Warming	ONE does not often hear financial analysts talk about climate change, but this month John A. Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, organized a teleconference to address a troubling question for Detroit's automakers: As regulators around the world move to curb global-warming emissions from cars and improve fuel efficiency, what happens if Wall Street adds up the costs? The most likely answer will not make General Motors and Ford Motor very happy. Mr. Casesa's call included a presentation by the World Resources Institute, an environmental policy group in Washington, which recently issued a report on the subject with Sustainable Asset Management, an investment group based in Zurich.
7/23/2004	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Power Shortage Shuts Auto Plant	The Volkswagen venture in Shanghai halted production because of a power shortage, the second automaker in China's biggest commercial city to shut down as rising temperatures push electricity demand to a record. Lack of power has forced Shanghai Volkswagen to stop work for several days at a time since the middle of July, a spokesman, Gu Huan, said. General Motors said Tuesday that its Shanghai venture shut down for 11 days for annual maintenance. Shanghai last week asked 3,000 companies to take rotating one-week breaks after temperatures rose above 95 degrees. The city's power production capacity had ''reached its limit,'' the local government said on its Web site. China, the world's fastest-growing economy, experienced power blackouts in four major cities and 24 of 27 provinces this year as an industrial boom pushes demand beyond generating capacity.
7/22/2004	Detroit Profits Most From Loans, Not Cars	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company may be two of the world's largest automakers, but they continue to make their money as banks. So with interest rates rising, and competitors like the Toyota Motor Corporation far more profitable in the industry's core business of manufacturing cars and trucks, the market has reacted cautiously to the improved earnings reports by Ford on Tuesday and G.M. on Wednesday.
7/14/2004	Our Towns; A Club Where Everyone Arrives in Style	TAISON ALI got the idea for the Brick City G.M. Crew at DeWayne Kennedy's wake a few years back. Kennedy had been a member of the Newark Cadillac Club, and when perhaps 25 Cadillacs showed up, Mr. Ali was so blown away it was almost like having a vision. ''Why not start a group of our own?'' he wondered. He had been a Cadillac man forever, from the '77 Seville that had been his first one, to the '72 Sedan de Ville, the '85 Eldorado convertible, the '85 Fleetwood Brougham and the rest, nine in all.
7/11/2004	IN THE REGION/New Jersey; Ex-G.M. Site Set to Have Mixed Uses In Englewood	AFTER sitting mostly idle for more than a decade, a squat warehouse where workers once packed spark plugs, fenders and other automotive parts for General Motors will be razed next month to make way for a new neighborhood of housing, offices and stores. The project, Englewood Commons, which is expected to cost more than $50 million, will rise on the 14.6-acre former plant site on Nordhoff Place, just north of Route 4 in a mostly industrial corner of Englewood in Bergen County.
7/10/2004	Chrysler Aloof, So Far, From Latest Incentive War	While General Motors and Ford are increasing incentives to combat slipping market share and rising inventories, Chrysler is holding back as it makes inroads on its two main rivals. G.M. announced this week that it was increasing its incentives on 2004 trucks and sport utility vehicles to $5,000, from $4,000, and is offering $4,000 cash back on most of its cars. It also expanded the rebates to include anyone who walks into the showroom. In June, the offer was only open to current owners of G.M. vehicles.
7/8/2004	G.M. AND FORD RAISE REBATES ON SEVERAL MODELS	General Motors increased rebates yesterday to $5,000 on most sport utility vehicles, its most profitable segment, and Ford Motor raised incentives on seven models after sales in the United States for the companies fell in June. General Motors, the world's biggest maker of cars and trucks, also raised rebates on most 2004-model cars and minivans to $4,000. The new General Motors incentives expire Aug. 2. Both automakers are increasing incentives to stem market-share losses to Asian automakers like Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, which are gaining without cutting prices as much. General Motors and Ford also want to bolster sales of sport utility vehicles and light trucks as gasoline prices hover near record highs.
7/4/2004	A Union Label, Inside Out	FOR more than half a century, Bea LaSorda's family history has been entwined with cars and Chrysler. Her father, Harry Rooney, led the local union in this small Canadian city across a slim river from Detroit. When she was a girl, he charged her, only half-jokingly, with keeping a lookout for Chrysler's company men while factory workers signed union cards in the basement. As a teenager, she watched Chrysler -- then and now the city's biggest employer -- try to throw him in jail. Her husband, Frank, another union leader, helped lead Chrysler through what were arguably its most difficult years -- those leading up to its 1980 bailout by the United States government, when Lee A. Iacocca was Chrysler's chief executive.
7/2/2004	Ford and G.M. Sales Both Fell More Than 11% in June	General Motors and Ford Motor said Thursday that their United States sales for June had double-digit declines, as Detroit continued to lose ground to Japanese and Korean rivals. Over all, sales in the United States were weaker than expected, down 5.97 percent from a year ago, when adjusted for an extra sales day this year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The seasonally adjusted selling rate for cars and light trucks tumbled to 15.4 million in June from 17.8 million in May, Ward's said.
7/2/2004	My Life, My Chevrolet Aveo	WHO -- Argy Koutsothanasis, 31, fashion stylist, Forest Hills, Queens WHAT -- 2004 Chevrolet Aveo LS hatchback Four months ago, my husband Nick Massios and I brought home our new baby. It's small, red and Korean. We call it ''the bug'' because it's so tiny, like a ladybug. Nick and I have had a couple of used cars, real clunkers, but the Aveo is our first brand-new car. I don't have kids or pets, so buying my first new vehicle is the closest I've come to being a first-time parent.
6/26/2004	Fo Shizzle, That Big Bad Chrysler Really Does Sizzle	When a global tastemaker like Snoop Dogg calls, the Motor City listens. So it was last month, when the rapper, actor and linguistic innovator, who added the suffix ''izzle'' to the American lexicon, left the following message at Chrysler's West Coast business office about the company's new 300C sedan:
6/20/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chevrolet Aveo; Cheap Date: The Last New Car Under $10,000	WITH a starting price of $9,995, the Chevrolet Aveo has the lowest sticker of any new car sold in the United States. That is only about a third the average retail selling price of a new vehicle, which reached a high of $27,550 in 2003, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Or to look at it another way, there are televisions that cost more than this econobox. So what do you get for the 10 large that could otherwise put a 50-inch Sony plasma set in your living room?
6/20/2004	What Lurks Inside Your Index Fund	THE extraordinarily long and wonderfully lucrative decline in interest rates is over. Are you ready for the coming seismic shift? Tumbling rates have kindled booms in stocks, bonds and real estate in recent years. They have also propelled shares of financial services companies, whose profits exploded as their capital costs sank. While rising rates will probably stop all of these booms, financial services stocks are particularly imperiled. And whether they know it or not, owners of equity index funds that mirror the Standard & Poor's 500 will be pained by the decline in these shares.
6/20/2004	Corrections	An article in the Automobiles section on June 6 about the history of Oldsmobile misidentified the associate of Ransom E. Olds who drove an Oldsmobile from Detroit to New York in 1901. He was Roy Chapin, a founder of the Hudson Motor Car Company, a predecessor of American Motors. (It was Chapin's son, Roy D. Chapin Jr., who served as chairman of A.M.C. from 1967 to 1977).
6/20/2004	Used Autos: Depreciation Included	IN 1988, a journalist asked Roger B. Smith, the chairman of General Motors, what his company offered to compete with Chrysler's inexpensive K-cars. Mr. Smith, who would soon become best known as the elusive subject of Michael Moore's documentary ''Roger and Me,'' responded that G.M. indeed offered comparable value, directing potential customers to ''a two-year-old Buick.'' This was years before the advent of the ''certified preowned'' euphemism, when the ''used'' in used car was often short for ''used up.'' So Mr. Smith took it on the chin for sounding elitist, and G.M. seemed out of touch with a value-conscious public that was buying K-cars like lottery tickets.
6/19/2004	G.M. Europe Is Revamping Operations	General Motors named Carl-Peter Forster, chief of its Adam Opel unit, as president of the company's money-losing European division to simplify its operations and to integrate the Opel, Vauxhall and Saab brands. The realignment is aimed at unifying the sales and marketing operations of the three brands and integrating design, Frederick Henderson, 45, who was promoted to chairman of G.M. Europe from president, said Friday.
6/9/2004	Corrections	A picture caption in World Business on Tuesday with an article about plans by General Motors to speed expansion in China misidentified a Cadillac on display before an auto show in Beijing. It was the Sixteen, a concept car, not the XLR.
6/8/2004	G.M. to Speed Up Expansion in China	Brushing aside slowing growth in car sales and broader concerns about the Chinese economy, General Motors executives announced on Monday that their company and its local venture partners would spend more than $3 billion by 2007 to expand operations in China. The heavy investment, to build new factories, expand existing ones and greatly increase G.M.'s engineering and design activities, is the latest and largest in a series of big investments by the world's leading automakers, all of which are racing to profit from the world's fastest-growing economy.
6/8/2004	Some Popular S.U.V.'s Fare Badly in Rollover Tests	The rear-wheel-drive version of the Ford Explorer, the nation's best-selling sport utility vehicle, tipped up on two wheels during a rollover test performed by the government, according to results released Monday. The news comes less than a week after a woman paralyzed in an Explorer rollover accident won a $369 million judgment against the Ford Motor Company.
6/6/2004	In Memory of Merry Oldsmobiles	You may have heard of jalopies, You heard the noise they make. Let me introduce you to my Rocket 88. Yes, it's great, just won't wait, Everybody likes my Rocket 88. WITH that 1951 lyric and a 45 r.p.m. record, Ike Turner and the Kings of Rhythm immortalized not only Oldsmobile's amazing new V-8, they also arguably created rock 'n' roll. ''Rocket 88'' was the first hit for Sam Phillips, and the producer used money from its sales to start Sun Records, which would go on to ''discover'' Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, B.B. King, Johnny Cash and others.
6/6/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Oldsmobile Alero; Not With a Bang but a Whimper	OLDSMOBILE, the oldest American automaker to reach the modern era, died on April 29, 2004, after a long illness complicated by faulty prescriptions and parental neglect. It was 107. The eldest child of the General Motors Corporation -- indeed, it was born 11 years before its adoptive parent -- Olds built its reputation with comfortable, stylish, technologically advanced cars for the aspiring middle class.
6/3/2004	Sales of Big S.U.V.'s Rebounded in May	Sales of the largest sport utility vehicles rebounded last month from a weak April as shoppers appeared to shrug off concerns about gas prices climbing above $2 a gallon. But liberal incentives offered last month on the largest sport utilities raise some questions about the quality of the sales results. Automakers offered average rebates of $3,477 for large sport utility vehicles in May, a substantial increase from $2,557 a year earlier, according to Power Information Network, an affiliate of J.D. Power & Associates. Industrywide, rebate spending rose to $2,719 last month from $2,535 a vehicle a year ago.
5/27/2004	People	Tony Kuhn was named executive vice president and managing director on the GMC Truck account at Lowe & Partners Worldwide, New York, succeeding Susan Cantor, now president of the Lowe New York office. Mr. Kuhn had been an automotive consultant at David E. Davis Jr. & Associates, Detroit, and previously worked at agencies like Bozell and Foote Cone & Belding. Lowe is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. GMC is part of General Motors.
5/21/2004	G.M. TO MOVE SAAB UNIT TO DETROIT AND CUT SOME JOBS	General Motors said yesterday that it would move the United States sales unit of its Saab division to Detroit from near Atlanta and that it might cut more than half the unit's 80 jobs to reduce costs. The move will be completed by Sept. 7, the unit, Saab Cars USA, said. About half of the unit's staff members will be offered a chance to relocate to the new offices at General Motors' headquarters, a Saab spokesman said. General Motors is cutting expenses and introducing new vehicles to try to halt losses at Saab, which has posted only two annual profits since G.M. bought half of it in 1990. G.M. acquired the rest in 2000.
5/20/2004	The Big Three Fear That Toyota Is Becoming the Big One	Toyota may not quite be the world's largest automaker, based on vehicle sales, but it is firmly buckled in the industry's driver's seat. That reality was reinforced last week when Toyota reported $10.2 billion in earnings for its latest fiscal year, which ended in March, the most ever made in a single year by a Japanese company.
5/19/2004	New Creative Director For Chevrolet Account	One of the biggest, most important jobs in advertising -- creating campaigns for the Chevrolet division of General Motors at Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich. -- is changing hands. Bill Ludwig, the top creative executive on the account since 1981, is turning over the assignment to a longtime New York creative executive, Brent Bouchez. Mr. Bouchez, 46, said yesterday that he would close Bouchez Kent & Company in New York, the agency he helped open nearly four years ago, to join Campbell-Ewald as executive creative director on the Chevrolet account, a new post. He will report to Mr. Ludwig, 49, who remains vice chairman and chief creative officer.
5/17/2004	No Longer the Next Big Thing, Hummer Offers First Rebates	Like other Hummer dealers, Jim Lynch is spending millions of dollars to erect a giant glass and steel Quonset hut in Chesterfield, Mo., to replace his dealership near St. Louis. General Motors is insisting that its Hummer dealers plant these fortresses in chic suburbs across America, each announced by a 35-foot-tall ''H'' out front. But most dealers are undertaking the ambitious construction project just as Hummer, the loudest and proudest of the giant American sport utility vehicles, has shown signs of losing its swagger.
5/7/2004	G.M. JOINS RIVALS IN INCREASING REBATES ON SPORT UTILITIES	General Motors added $1,000 to rebates on midsize sport utility vehicles like the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, a day after Ford and DaimlerChrysler raised their incentives for sport utilities. The increase doubles, to $2,000, the rebates consumers can use with existing no-interest loan offers of up to five years, a G.M. spokeswoman said. The offers end June 1. Ford and Chrysler increased rebates after Toyota and Nissan won market share in April.
5/5/2004	Auto Sales Lower Than Expected in April	Sales of several popular large sport utility vehicles, including the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition and Cadillac Escalade, tailed off in April, but automakers generally insist that high gas prices are not changing the purchase decisions of customers. Sales of sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks continue to dominate the market, but there were signs of a shift from the largest S.U.V.'s to smaller ones in the auto industry's April sales reports, which were released on Monday and Tuesday.
5/4/2004	A top creative executive at an agency in Detroit is moving on, and changing car brands.	ONE of the most peripatetic creative executives in automotive advertising, Gary Topolewski, is on the move again, poached unexpectedly by the agency that produces campaigns for the Chrysler Group from an agency that works for General Motors. Mr. Topolewski is leaving Chemistri in Troy, Mich., where he had been chairman and chief creative officer, working on G.M. brands like Cadillac and Pontiac, for the Troy office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Mr. Topolewski, 47, will join the Troy office, known as BBDO Detroit, as one of two chief creative officers, working with Bill Morden, who had been the sole chief creative officer since 2001.
5/2/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon; Between the Featherweights and the Sumos	''THE bigger, the better'' is the attitude of many truck-loving Americans. Certainly there are ranchers and construction workers who could not do their jobs without the load capacity, space and general ruggedness of a big pickup. Far fewer people actually need such capabilities for their everyday chores or weekend projects. Rather, they like the image of saddling up one of the biggest horses on the highway. ''Wouldn't I look tough,'' you can practically hear them musing, ''riding high in that big Dodge Ram Hemi?''
4/30/2004	Oldsmobile Joins Ranks of Packard and Nash	General Motors called it the Road to Redemption campaign: After years of problems with quality, the company started proclaiming in an unusual series of newspaper and magazine ads beginning last year that it had rededicated itself to fixing its past problems. ''Humbling lessons'' had been learned over the last decade, the ads said. New leaves had been turned over. And after a ''long journey back,'' G.M. was ''building the best cars and trucks in our history.''
4/28/2004	G.M. Has Way to Go on Road to Recall Redemption	Two years ago, shopping for a sporty Chevrolet Cavalier, Jessica Coutsonikas took the route of many a first-time car-buyer short on cash but long on desire: she decided to lease. But when she went to DePaula Chevrolet here on Thursday to lease a new car, she discovered that in New York, leasing the Cavalier was no longer an option.
4/24/2004	CARMAKERS LIMIT NEW YORK LEASES	The Shanghai Automotive Company, the publicly traded unit of China's biggest carmaker, said first-quarter profit more than doubled as it sold more Buick and Sail cars made with its partner, the General Motors Corporation. Net income increased to 710.7 million yuan ($86 million) from 307.5 million yuan. Sales rose 21 percent, to 2 billion yuan, from 1.7 billion yuan. Shanghai Auto is benefiting from China's booming car sales, which expanded 44 percent in the first quarter.
4/21/2004	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Profit In Auto Sales	General Motors reported a decline in first-quarter profit on Tuesday, but the results were better than expected, driven by a record performance in its financing business, surging Asian auto sales and a shrinking tax bill in the United States. In light of those factors, the company raised its profit estimate for the full year, to $7 a share from a previous range of $6 to $6.50 a share.
4/19/2004	Struck in Side, Many Cars Fare Poorly In Safety Test	The results are in from the first consumer test of how passenger cars fare when struck in the side by sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. And they are not good. Ten of 13 midsize car models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group financed by car insurers, received the lowest of four possible ratings, indicating a likelihood of serious or fatal injury. The tests also showed that women were at disproportionate risk in truck-car side-impact collisions.
4/19/2004	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; Detroit Drops In for a Fashion Checkup	SPRING'S first forsythia blooms in Central Park were a near-perfect match for the brilliant yellow paint of a passing Hummer H2. From inside the jumbo S.U.V., Ed Welburn, vice president for North American design at General Motors, scanned the change of scenery as a bustling Fifth Avenue streetscape came into view. When the Hummer emerged from the shadows of the park's roadways and drove into bright daylight, Mr. Welburn pointed to the cluster of limousines and S.U.V.'s. ''I love this city,'' he said. ''There is no other city in the world where big cars seem more in scale.''
4/12/2004	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; Vlite Puts a Spring in Buick's Step	WHEN General Motors executives went to China in the mid-1990's with a proposal to build automobiles, they negotiated long and hard with local officials about the types of vehicles to be manufactured. On one point the Chinese were unwilling to compromise: any models built by G.M. -- even if they were to be little more than rebadged Chevys or Opels -- had to carry the nameplate of the company's Buick division. The emperor, you see, had owned Buicks in the 1930's. Chairman Mao would have been appalled, but the directive may have contributed to the company's success. Buicks sell briskly in China, while sales are shrinking in the United States.
4/11/2004	Fanfare for the Common Car...	LIKE the children in Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, the auto industry's precocious offspring are all above average. The next generation of cars and trucks, on display this week at the New York auto show, are all special, gifted and talented, their manufacturers contend. Automakers are reluctant to admit to making what designers call car-cars, the basic family sedans bought by millions of typical Americans. Instead, they prefer to draw attention to fanciful design studies that project fun and freedom, all the better if they exude elegance like the Buick Vlite or design innovation like the Lexus LF-C.
4/10/2004	24-Hour Test Drives Seem to Pass Carmakers' Test as a Sales Tool	With big cash incentives appearing to lose some of their power to attract uyers, General Motors and several other automakers are extending 24-hour test drives and other hands-on marketing programs, particularly for featured new models that they would rather not sell at a steep discount. On April 1, for example, G.M. started the fourth round of its 24-hour test drives, which let potential customers take a car home overnight so they can better see how much cargo it carries, how their children fit in the back seat, or how the neighbors react. In the year since the program began, about 650,000 people have taken part, and roughly one-third bought the cars they tested.
4/6/2004	END OF OLDSMOBILE ALERO WILL COST 1,500 G.M. JOBS	General Motors plans to cut about 1,500 more jobs at a Lansing, Mich., factory on June 7 by eliminating a shift when it ends production of the Oldsmobile Alero. The factory, which has three shifts and 4,600 hourly workers, produces the Alero, Pontiac Grand Am and Chevy Classic midsize cars. Laid-off workers will be eligible for other jobs within the company, including as many as 2,600 openings at a new vehicle plant scheduled to open in 2006 in Delta Township, a Lansing suburb, a company spokesman, Dan Flores, said. General Motors, based in Detroit, has not said what it will build at the new factory.
4/5/2004	Carmakers Have a New Idea. It's Called a Car.	Detroit, which has long feasted on trucks, says it has rediscovered the car. Will the public buy it?
4/2/2004	For Americans, Gas Guzzlers Are Again Kings Of the Road	Gasoline prices may be at an all-time high, but that is not deterring Americans from buying gas guzzlers. Maintaining a trend that dates back more than a decade, American buyers continued to shift from passenger cars to the largest and least fuel-efficient new vehicles that auto manufacturers offer, even as gasoline prices soar, according to the industry's March sales reports.
3/28/2004	Carmakers Pull Plug On Electric Vehicles	FIVE to 10 years ago, when the future seemed to belong to electric cars -- and California clean-air rules forced reluctant automakers to offer them -- a small but enthusiastic group of optimists and environmentalists signed on as pioneers. While a few bought electrics outright, most signed leases that obliged them to return the vehicles after a few years. Regulators and auto manufacturers have since pinned their hopes on newer technologies, like hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles and, further in the future, hydrogen cars. Electric autos have become orphans, abandoned in favor of more promising offspring.
3/19/2004	G.M. FINANCE UNIT TO OPEN BANK IN UTAH	The General Motors Corporation's finance unit plans to open a federally insured bank in Utah to take advantage of the state's favorable regulations and cut its borrowing costs. The new bank will let the finance unit, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, raise funds by selling certificates of deposit. G.M.A.C. will use the funds to buy as much as $8 billion in vehicle loan and lease contracts from General Motors dealers in the bank's first three years, said Jerome Van Orman, the chief financial officer for GMAC North America.
3/14/2004	Saturn Revs Up A Sleepy Image	IN seeking a name for its new higher-performance models, Saturn looked no further than the gauges on its dashboards. The redline of a tachometer indicates how fast an engine can safely run; among enthusiasts the term indicates peak performance. So with Red Line versions of the Vue utility wagon and Ion compact car, two vehicles never known for blistering performance, Saturn hopes to develop a more powerful image to counter its reputation for building sensible and reliable -- but hardly exciting -- transportation appliances.
3/14/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Saturn Vue Red Line; Finally, Some Zoom With a Vue	TWO years ago, Saturn's first utility wagon made its debut to polite but hardly deafening applause. I drove several versions of that new vehicle, the Vue, with various engines, transmissions and drivetrain combinations, and while I found the size and price appealing, the overall package seemed rather uninspired. Aside from cheap-looking plastic in the cabin, the Vue had a soft suspension with excessive body lean on corners, numb electric steering, a noisy V-6 engine and a continuously variable transmission that felt crude and sounded whiny. The little wagon just didn't measure up to more polished competitors like the Ford Escape and Honda CR-V.
3/14/2004	G.M. Is Extending the Warranty On Variable Saturn Transmission	BECAUSE of concerns about the durability of Saturn's continuously variable transmissions, General Motors is extending the warranty. The extension applies to 2002-04 models, as well as to future models that will use the same transmission. The warranty will be stretched to 5 years or 75,000 miles from the original term of 3 years or 36,000 miles, a G.M. spokeswoman, Debbie Frakes, said late last week. Only two G.M. vehicles sold in the United States, the Saturn Vue and Ion, currently use the transmission.
3/12/2004	G.M. Says Costs For Retiree Care Top $60 Billion	General Motors said on Thursday that its future health care obligation for retirees rose last year to $63.4 billion, from $57 billion in 2002. If not for the effects of the new Medicare legislation signed in December by President Bush, the obligation would have been $67.5 billion. The figures were disclosed in the company's annual report, which was released on Thursday. Many domestic manufacturers say that soaring health care costs have become their chief competitive burden.
3/10/2004	A niche no more: gay celebrities are in demand as endorsers for mainstream campaigns.	MADISON AVENUE is offering a queer aye for the straight buy, increasingly using openly gay and lesbian celebrities in campaigns aimed not at the homosexual market but at the wider general audience. The advertisers involved include American Express, Audi, Cartier, Chili's, Diageo, Marshall Field's, General Motors, Target, Volkswagen and Wrigley. They are hiring personalities like the singers K.D. Lang and Melissa Etheridge, the designers Isaac Mizrahi and Todd Oldham, the actor John Cameron Mitchell and the former football player Esera Tuaolo, along with all five members of the cast of ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' and an executive producer of the series, David Collins.
3/5/2004	My Life, My Cadillac Escalade EXT	WHO -- Courtney Leigh Hyan, 16, high school sophomore, Yorba Linda, Calif. WHAT -- 2004 Cadillac Escalade EXT I WAS expecting to get a watch for my 16th birthday, but I got a Cadillac pickup instead. All my friends drive trucks. My dad says, ''I don't know what it is with girls today; they want pickups.'' I think it's the feminism factor. Usually guys are the ones who have pickups, but now girls are like, ''Hey, we can have them, too.'' We get one, and the guys think it's cool. So you have this masculine symbol, but at the same time, you get attention from guys. It's a win-win.
2/29/2004	G Is for Guzzler, T Is for Tax, O Is for Oops	THE new Pontiac GTO has many claims to fame. It went from concept car to showroom model in only 18 months, demonstrating General Motors' new prowess in product development. It is fast, racing from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in just 5.3 seconds. It is nimble, taking curves at speeds that the original GTO of the 1960's couldn't have begun to handle.
2/22/2004	Buick Sticks Its Nose Into the Truck Market	TESTED: 2004 Buick Rainier CXL Plus HOW MUCH? Base CXL 2WD 6, $36,045. Top-line CXL Plus AWD 6, $39,045. $43,100 as tested, with V-8 and all-wheel drive.
2/20/2004	G.M. LAYS OFF 350 WORKERS AT PLANT IN NEW JERSEY	General Motors said it laid off 350 of the 1,350 hourly workers at a Linden, N.J., plant as it shifts production of midsize pickups to a newly renovated Louisiana factory. The Linden plant, which has been shut for three weeks, ended production of Chevrolet S10 and GMC Sonoma trucks in January. The models are being replaced by two models built in Shreveport, La., a company spokesman, Dan Flores, said. The Linden plant will continue to make sport utility vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer at least through mid-2005, Mr. Flores said.
2/15/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chevrolet SSR; What Will It Haul? Your Ego	IF all that mattered in choosing a wristwatch was its ability to track minutes and hours with reasonable accuracy, a Timex would be the equal of a Rolex. But factors beyond basic utility -- style, pride of ownership or whatever you want to call it -- influence buyers, too, motivating them to spend thousands of dollars on fine mechanical timepieces that are also investments in precious metal and in self-esteem. If you hold dear the belief that spending money on anything beyond pure function is a wasteful indulgence -- if, in short, you're a Timex sort of consumer -- you will probably never get the point of the Chevrolet SSR. Reading further will provide no compelling logic to justify buying a vehicle that looks a great deal like a pickup truck but is certainly not as utilitarian.
2/11/2004	G.M. SETTLES SUIT ON LENDING DISCRIMINATION	The General Motors Corporation has agreed to pay as much as $11.2 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that claimed its finance unit charged higher interest rates for blacks than for whites. The finance unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, will pay as much as $9.6 million in fees and expenses and spend $1.6 million to educate consumers about credit financing, the automaker said. The settlement does not include payments to consumers, G.M. said. The finance unit will also cap how much G.M. dealers can mark up interest rates on vehicle loans and start a marketing effort aimed at generating 1.25 million loan offers over five years to black and Hispanic customers.
2/7/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Carmaker Strikes Continue	DaimlerChrysler and the Adam Opel unit of General Motors were among companies hit by a seventh day of labor stoppages aimed at pressing demands for more pay, the IG Metall union said. About 50,000 workers at 156 production sites walked off their shifts temporarily or left work early to support union demands for 4 percent more pay, IG Metall said. The union said it planned more walkouts next week at companies including the Audi unit of Volkswagen on Monday and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, the world's largest maker of printing equipment, on Tuesday.
2/6/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Compuware To Buy Remaining Covisint Assets	The Compuware Corporation has agreed to buy the Covisint Internet venture that was created by automakers including Ford and General Motors. The value of the deal was not disclosed. The acquisition will add 1 or 2 cents a share to profit in the year ending in March 2005, the Detroit-based Compuware said yesterday. Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler created Covisint, based in Southfield, Mich., in February 2000 to cut their purchasing costs by communicating with suppliers electronically. Compuware shares rose 15 cents, to $7.93.
2/5/2004	Ratings Seem to Show Less Chance of a Rollover	For the first time, some truck-based sport utility vehicles received as many as four out of five stars in rollover ratings, according to 2004 model ratings released yesterday by federal regulators. But the higher ratings may not necessarily mean the vehicles have become safer, because the government has changed the way it tests them. In the new tests, using real vehicles on a test track as well as mathematical calculations, the four-wheel-drive versions of several similar sport utility vehicles made by General Motors -- the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada and the new Buick Rainier -- earned four stars, even though they are virtually identical to G.M. vehicles that rated only three stars last year.
2/4/2004	Incentives and New S.U.V. Help Chrysler Bolster Sales	By offering incentives worth more than $1,000 and a range of new sport utility models, the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler and several Japanese automakers racked up sales gains in January even as General Motors and the Ford Motor Company posted declines. Chrysler said its sales increased 9 percent last month compared with the corresponding month in 2003 after adjusting for one extra selling day this January. Including Mercedes, sales for DaimlerChrysler over all rose 7.7 percent, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich.
2/3/2004	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Friday about General Motors' purchase of the 51 percent of the Delta Motor Corporation in South Africa that it does not already own misspelled the name of a car assembled there. It is the Opel, not Opal.
2/1/2004	Waterfront Puzzle: Putting the Pieces Together	EVEN with its buildings gone, the site where General Motors once produced minivans still dominates the landscape here, its concrete foundation stretching to the Hudson River, and a quaint lighthouse that reflects a bygone era. This is the town's future, an empty canvas offering nearly 100 acres of prime riverfront real estate in the shadow of the Tappan Zee Bridge.
1/31/2004	G.M. Nears Settlement In Lawsuit Over Lending	General Motors is close to becoming the second automaker to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that the industry's lending practices let car dealers discriminate against blacks and other minorities when they set loan rates. Lawyers representing tens of thousands of African-American car buyers have reached a tentative settlement with the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the financial services division of G.M., both sides said Friday.
1/30/2004	G.M. Returns 10 Years After End Of Apartheid	Ten years after the end of apartheid, one of the largest companies to divest itself of its South African holdings is coming back. The General Motors Corporation, which sold its operations here to local management in 1987, will buy back the remaining 51 percent of the Delta Motor Corporation under a deal approved earlier this week by South African regulators. Delta, which has been 49 percent owned by G.M. since 1997, will become General Motors South Africa and join G.M.'s money-losing Latin America, Africa and Middle East division.
1/29/2004	The Super Spots Lighten Up, At $2.3 Million For 30 Seconds	Twenty years after the Super Bowl first became as big a day for advertising as it is for professional football, Madison Avenue is gearing up for what looks to be a cheerier, somewhat sillier and certainly more expensive version of the annual midwinter festival of commercialism. The Ad Bowl within Super Bowl XXXVIII, to be broadcast on Sunday by CBS, will be infused with oversize servings of ingredients like humor, schmaltz, special effects and anthropomorphic animals.
1/28/2004	A new Jeep commercial hits back at Hummer as the two military offshoots continue their struggle.	THE big boys in Motor City's sandbox, Hummer and Jeep, are rumbling again. Jeep, a division of DaimlerChrysler, is running a commercial that shows a group of children tooting around in toy Jeeps while an overweight boy struggles to get his go-cart Hummer out of the mud.
1/28/2004	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about Toyota's surpassing of Ford Motor to become the world's second-largest automaker, behind General Motors, misstated G.M.'s global vehicle sales. For 2003 they were 8.6 million, not billion. That compared with 8.63 million in 2002, not billion.
1/27/2004	Toyota Overtakes Ford as World's No. 2 Automaker	Toyota knocked the Ford Motor Company from its longtime position as the world's second-largest automaker last year, according to Toyota's final sales results, which were released on Monday. Now all that stands between Toyota and first place is General Motors, setting up a challenge to America's dominance over the global auto industry that has been years in the making. Executives at Toyota have repeatedly protested that selling more vehicles than Ford or G.M. is not their goal, in and of itself.
1/25/2004	Coloring America Hopeful	CHRISTOPHER WEBB was standing in the middle of a ring of model cars, about to pose for a photograph, when he noticed a troubling presence: a green one. ''I definitely don't want to be near green,'' he declared, his British accent flaring. Coming from a man poised to become one of North America's leading arbiters of color, this was a notable pronouncement. Not only is green out, apparently, but it has always been a somewhat star-crossed hue.
1/25/2004	Hummer Tries On New Shoes	IN need of just the right shoe for its new star, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Nike designed the Air Zoom Generation for the teenage sensation to wear and promote. It's not called Air James yet, but just as Air Jordans borrowed elements from Ferrari and Aston Martin, the shoe took inspiration from the Hummer that James's mother bought him -- with lace holes that resemble Hummer wheels and tread that bears the chevron pattern of the Hummer tire. Nike has now returned the favor. Its designers helped General Motors to shape the H3T concept, shown recently at the Los Angeles auto show as one answer to the question: can you build a smaller Hummer that people will want? Can the Hummer look work on a smaller scale? The process began with the truck's ''shoes'' -- its tires. ''Usually the tires of a concept like this are an afterthought,'' said Clay Dean, Hummer design director. ''Here, they were the key element.''
1/23/2004	Ford Reports 2003 Profit But Posts Loss In 4th Quarter	Led by its financial unit, the Ford Motor Company reported a slim profit for 2003 on Thursday, after losing more than $6 billion over the previous two years. But in the fourth quarter, Ford said, its loss grew from the quarter a year earlier, largely because of a $1.6 billion charge taken primarily to cover health care and other benefits for 20,000 Ford production workers who remain at its former subsidiary, the parts maker Visteon.
1/22/2004	GENERAL MOTORS TO BUY OUT SOUTH AFRICAN AUTOMAKER	To gain greater access to a growing market, General Motors has agreed to buy the 51 percent of Delta Motor Corporation, a South African automaker, that it does not already own. Delta sold about 40,000 vehicles last year. The purchase, which would restore G.M.'s control of a former unit, depends on government approval, G.M. said. The transaction price was not disclosed. South African auto sales rose 5.3 percent last year to a seven-year high of 368,454. Delta sells cars and trucks from G.M.'s Opel European unit and from its Japanese affiliate, Isuzu Motors. The company is based in Port Elizabeth.
1/21/2004	G.M. Posts A Decline In Profit For Quarter	General Motors reported a slight decline in its fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday as strength in its financial operations was offset by a price war in North America that failed to increase market share. G.M. continued to show difficulty making money in its core business, making cars and trucks. Global automotive operations, struggling everywhere but in the Asia-Pacific region, swung to a $167 million loss in the quarter from a $574 million profit in the period a year earlier, including one-time items.
1/12/2004	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; After a 50-Year Journey, Nomad Comes Home	WHAT makes humans human, argued the travel writer Bruce Chatwin in books like ''The Songlines'' and ''In Patagonia,'' is not the use of tools or the building of cities, but nomadism. The trait that distinguishes us from other beings, he theorized, was that we keep moving. For designers and auto enthusiasts, the importance of concept cars lies in precisely this human restlessness. That is why Chevrolet's Nomad may prove to be the most significant concept car at this year's winter auto shows. The Nomad design team was led by Simon Cox, the director of General Motors' advanced design studio in Britain. Dale Brewer did the exterior and Jose Gonzalez the interior. In its 2004 dream-car version, the Nomad presents an international vision of an American classic.
1/11/2004	His Trade Secret? Or a Company's Property?	FOR nine years, John Juriga lived with a lie. The General Motors Corporation, his employer, had been battling an important trade-secret case, and Mr. Juriga, an engineer, had been hailed as a hero for finding a crucial memo that was a linchpin of the company's defense. But, just weeks before the case was to go to trial last spring in Superior Court in Waterbury, Mr. Juriga broke down and admitted he had faked the evidence. Mr. Juriga's forgery is just one of many extraordinary twists in a bizarre business dispute that has been simmering in Connecticut since 1989. At issue: Did General Motors steal a breakthrough design in automotive cooling technology for its Corvette from Jack Evans, an inventor from Sharon, and then attempt, as Mr. Evans claimed, to drive him out of business so he wouldn't have the will or the means to fight back? G.M. denied the charge, but Mr. Evans insisted he has been robbed of a valuable trade secret.
1/10/2004	Big Three Hope Rising Economy Will Lift All Vehicles	The Big Three are putting a bullish face on 2004, predicting that a wave of new products, aided by an improving economy, will increase earnings and might even cool off their price war. The first week of the year is always a big one in Detroit, opening with the press preview of the North American International Auto Show, where the industry shows off its new cars and trucks with plenty of pomp, rock and smoke machines.
1/6/2004	Detroit to Focus on Tastes as Its Market Share Decreases	The strengthening economy and generous sales incentives led to robust car sales last year, automakers said Monday, but the American companies' share of the market continued to shrink as import brands like Toyota, Honda and BMW posted the biggest gains. Despite those declines, the American companies did not pledge to increase market share in 2004, as they have often done. Instead, they said they would look for ways to make the cars and trucks that they do sell more profitable, largely by making them more appealing to consumers.
1/5/2004	G.M. Executive Preaches: Sweat the Smallest Details	Robert A. Lutz is trying to persuade the world's largest automaker, General Motors, to obsess about the smallest details, from the way a stereo knob feels when you turn it to eliminating the cheap-looking shine from plastics used in interiors. ''People say, 'I don't know what it is, but when I rent an American car at the airport and look at all these minor imperfections, the message it sends is that you guys don't care,' and that message is very powerful,'' said Mr. Lutz, General Motors' vice chairman for product development. ''It's a turnoff.''
1/4/2004	Hollywood Debuts for G.M. Cars	IN an effort to prove it is serious about the important California market, General Motors was the only automaker to introduce high-volume products at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show last week. During the show's press preview, held between Christmas and New Year's Day, G.M. unveiled the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, which will replace the Cavalier compact car and compete with the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, among others.
1/4/2004	In Detroit, Home Teams Swing for the Fences	THE Detroit Tigers ended their season a game shy of the modern record for most losses by a major league baseball team. The Lions, with just 5 wins and 11 losses, are sitting out the N.F.L. playoffs. There is hope, at least, for the Red Wings in hockey and the Pistons of the N.B.A. Hopeful, too, are the roughed-up home teams of the auto industry as they kick off 2004 on their home turf in the rollicking, bruising, cheerleading spectacle known as the North American International Auto Show.
1/4/2004	Corvette Chronicles: Chapter 6	ANTICIPATION always runs high when Chevrolet enters the maternity ward to deliver a new Corvette. Based on the four previous times one generation has given way to the next, enthusiasts have come to expect epic leaps in design, engineering and performance. But the keepers of the flame had different priorities for the sixth-generation car, which will be unveiled today in Detroit: instead of inventing a whole new Corvette, Dave Hill, the chief engineer, concentrated on fixing small glitches in the old one.
1/1/2004	FreeMarkets Agrees to Buy Auction Unit of Covisint	FreeMarkets, which makes Internet-auction software, is buying the auto parts auction business of Covisint, a venture of General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler. FreeMarkets, which is based in Pittsburgh and expects to conclude the purchase in January, will fulfill parts contracts with the three automakers using its software for three years, the companies said in a statement yesterday. Terms were not disclosed.
12/20/2003	F.C.C. Approves Deal Giving Murdoch Control Of DirecTV	The Federal Communications Commission yesterday conditionally approved the News Corporation's acquisition of control of Hughes Electronics and its DirecTV subsidiary from General Motors. The approval, by a vote of 3 to 2, removes the final obstacle to a $6.6 billion media megamerger that will combine the DirecTV satellite television service with News Corporation's Fox studios, pay television networks like Fox News and Speed, its Fox broadcast channel and 35 local stations. News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, will become the only media conglomerate with such broad offerings and national reach. Time Warner also combines studios, cable and broadcast networks and cable systems, but it does not own local stations and its cable systems reach only certain parts of the country. The deal is expected to close within days.
12/19/2003	Chevrolet greets the new year with an ambitious campaign to introduce 10 vehicles in 20 months.	WITH 10 new vehicles coming to the market over the next 20 months, Chevrolet knew its advertising would have to depart significantly from what had been done in the recent past. There would need to be less attention paid to lifestyle and feeling good and more to its new cars and trucks. So on New Year's Eve, Chevrolet will introduce a multimillion-dollar campaign, with the tagline ''An American Revolution,'' that intends to make the vehicles the stars. The campaign is significant because it covers both cars and trucks under one umbrella. Before this, Chevrolet ran a truck campaign, ''Like a Rock,'' and a car campaign, ''We'll Be There.''
12/18/2003	'Because It's There': Commandeering a G.P.S. Navigator	RAY AND ELNA KAWAL hit the open road this fall on an 8,000-mile trip in their 2002 Chevy Tahoe with General Motors' OnStar navigation system serving as their North Star. From their home in Sequim, Wash., across to Denver and Chicago, down to Mexico and then homeward through Arizona and California, the Kawals followed directions to tourist destinations, hotels and their friends' homes using OnStar's Global Positioning System navigation -- just the kind of business G.M. covets for its subscription service. But in this case, the automaker didn't make a penny from the six-week excursion.
12/14/2003	A Malibu With a Little More	CATEGORIES of cars and trucks keep blurring. Pity the poor customer who has to figure out whether she wants a station wagon, a sport utility, a minivan or a sedan. General Motors' latest contribution to the confusion is the Malibu Maxx. G.M.'s Chevrolet division calls this new version of the Malibu an ''extended sedan,'' but that only clouds the picture further.
12/14/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chevrolet Malibu; G.M. Refines Its Recipe For a White-Bread Car	IF you are old enough, you may have heard this before: General Motors wants to be the leader in midsize family cars. Indeed, if your memory reaches back to the 1960's and 70's, you may recall how G.M. dominated the medium-size market. Back then, the Chevrolet Malibu, and the larger Impala, were the rocks on which G.M. built a seemingly impenetrable fortress.
12/13/2003	Pension Gap Is Closing, G.M. Reports	General Motors said yesterday that it stood a good chance of ending 2003 with its pension plans for American employees fully funded, after beginning the year with the biggest deficit of any company. While the rising stock market helped G.M.'s pension funds, the company accomplished this feat mostly by taking extraordinary measures to raise cash for the funds. It is contributing much of the $17.5 billion raised in an unusual bond offering earlier in the year. In addition, G.M. is infusing $4.1 billion from the sale of its Hughes Electronics unit to the News Corporation, a deal it expects to complete soon.
12/12/2003	My Life, My Grand Am GT	WHO -- Joe Haughton, 23, assistant manager, Valvoline Instant Oil Change, Ossining, N.Y. WHAT -- 1994 Pontiac Grand Am GT I've had one car for every year I've been driving, and I got my license at 18. The cars come and go. I junk them, sell them, crash them. If you ask me, there is a car for every phase of a person's life. These days I feel lucky to be alive, and, hopefully, the Grand Am will help keep me that way.
12/7/2003	Big Pontiac Gets a V-8 Again	WHILE General Motors is counting on the GTO to put some excitement back into Pontiac, the company reserved a trick or two for its full-size Bonneville sedan. The Bonneville's lower-end trim lines, the SE and the SLE, have been carried over pretty much intact from the 2003 model year. But the top-of-the-line, garishly trimmed SSEi will be replaced in February with the clean-looking GXP. This model is powered by the widely admired Northstar V-8 engine from Cadillac. Despite its claims of being G.M.'s Excitement Division, no Pontiac (except for the defunct Firebird and the new GTO) has had a V-8 engine for 18 years.
12/7/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Pontiac GTO; The Goat Scurries Back Looking a Bit Sheepish	TO millions of testosterone-infused young men who came of age in the middle to late 1960's, the Pontiac GTO was as big a turn-on as Ann-Margret. The GTO, affectionately known as the Goat, made a generation's hearts race faster. The development of the original GTO was not exactly rocket science -- although in a sense, it was rocket science. Pontiac simply took its medium-size LeMans, stuffed in a bored-out engine and other high-performance parts and bolted on rumbling dual exhausts.
12/5/2003	G.M. IN BID FOR SOUTH KOREAN AUTOMAKER	General Motors, the biggest foreign automaker in South Korea, was preparing to join the auction for the Ssangyong Motor Company with a bid for a controlling stake worth about $550 million. General Motors submitted a letter to creditors who are selling 55.4 percent of Ssangyong, saying it plans to make an offer, said Kim Sung Soo, a spokesman for the G.M.-Daewoo Auto and Technology Company, which is based in Seoul. Ssangyong's shares rose 5.4 percent; a merger with G.M.-Daewoo is seen as helping both companies close the gap with the market leaders.
12/4/2003	G.M. Climbs 5.2% on News on Pension Funds	Shares of the General Motors Corporation, the world's largest automaker, rose 5.2 percent yesterday, the most in almost six months, after a Goldman Sachs analyst said pension-fund improvements might increase profit in 2004. The deficit in G.M.'s United States pension plans may narrow to $4.5 billion at the end of the year from about $19.2 billion a year earlier because of rising stock markets, the analyst, Gary Lapidus, said in a report. Reduced pension costs may add as much as 50 cents a share to 2004 net income, he said. G.M.'s stock gained $2.26, to $45.54 a share. A G.M. spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, declined to discuss the Goldman Sachs report or the share gain.
12/3/2003	Revived Economy Helped Lift Automakers' November Sales	Sales at General Motors, BMW and Honda's luxury division, Acura, all surged last month, largely because of the rebounding economy, automakers said Tuesday. DaimlerChrysler said its sales rose slightly in November from the month a year ago, while the Ford Motor Company's sales showed a decline. G.M. said its sales grew 22 percent in November, with truck sales up 30 percent and the Cadillac division up 43 percent. Honda reported record sales for Acura, a gain of 24.7 percent over last year. BMW said it had its best November sales ever; sales increased 6.4 percent over all, led by an 18 percent increase for the Mini.
12/3/2003	G.M. SAYS IT WILL NOT SELL MORTGAGE UNIT	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had decided not to sell its commercial mortgage business because the company could not get the price it sought and had found ways to pay for the unit's growth. The unit, the General Motors Commercial Holding Corporation, had been up for sale since March. General Motors wanted to raise money to pay for its auto and home finance businesses and ensure that the commercial-mortgage unit had access to cheaper capital. General Motors Commercial Holding had assets of about $14.6 billion as of the end of September. The unit increased net income 60 percent, to $243 million, in this year's first three quarters from the year-earlier period, a spokeswoman, Toni Simonetti, said.
11/23/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Cadillac SRX; A Station Wagon Rolls Into the Cadillac Revival Tent	IN eighth grade, I went on dates to school dances with my first real boyfriend. His mother was our chauffeur, in her pale yellow Cadillac Sedan deVille. I sat perched on the front seat between him and his mother, uncomfortable in more ways than one. Now the tables are turned. I recently found myself at the wheel of a new Cadillac, driving three 6th-grade boys to a middle-school dance. But my Caddy wasn't anything like Mrs. G's oversized, overstuffed land yacht. The SRX is a thoroughly modern, almost futuristic-looking family hauler with crisp, sporty handling.
11/14/2003	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about a downgrade in the debt rating of the Ford Motor Company by Standard & Poor's referred incorrectly to the ratings of General Motors and DaimlerChrysler. While S.& P. has a negative outlook on the companies, it does not have them on a more serious credit watch. The article also referred incorrectly to the profit margins achieved by the top Japanese automakers. The 8 percent figure was for operating margins, not net ones. Because of an editing error, the article referred imprecisely to the rally in Ford's stock. Investors were relieved that the downgrade was not accompanied by a negative outlook, not that the rating stayed above junk status.
11/14/2003	Corrections	A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about agreements by the Big Three automakers to export cars and parts to China reversed the identities of two General Motors executives. The company's chairman, Rick Wagoner, was at the right; Gary Cowger, a vice president, was at the left.
11/13/2003	China Lowers the Wall for U.S. Cars and Parts	In a move to quell criticism of its huge trade surplus with the United States, China agreed to let the Big Three automakers send it about 15,000 cars and trucks over the next couple of years as well as more than $1 billion in parts from General Motors, the companies said Wednesday. China also said that it would allow G.M. to import cars directly, without using a local partner, and G.M. said it was moving into the auto lending business in China.
11/12/2003	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: G.M. Opens A Lab	General Motors said that it had set up a $21 million auto research laboratory in Bangalore, India's technology capital. The laboratory, G.M.'s first outside the United States, will focus on vehicle design, manufacturing technology and electronic integration. The laboratory employs 17 scientists and the number will increase to 100 soon. ''The lab provides an increased diversity of talent and resources to our global research and development network,'' said Alan Taub, executive director of the science laboratories for G.M. research and development. Saritha Rai (NYT)
11/12/2003	More Big 3 Cars to China	General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler said yesterday that they had reached agreements with China to import more cars and trucks built in the United States.
11/4/2003	Sales Fell in October for G.M. and Ford	Reporting one of the domestic automobile industry's toughest months yet this year, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said on Monday that sales fell in October from the month last year. G.M. said its sales dropped 7 percent in October, while Ford said sales fell 2 percent. Among the Big Three, only the Chrysler Corporation, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, reported a gain over last year, rising 11 percent to let it remain in third place ahead of the Toyota Motor Company of Japan, which said sales rose 11.7 percent in October.
10/27/2003	Corrections	An article on the Automobiles page of SportsMonday last week about vintage Pontiac GTO's misstated the size of a high-performance V-8 engine that became available on 1969 models. The engine, a 370-horsepower Ram Air IV, displaced 400 cubic inches, not 455.
10/27/2003	G.M. and Fiat Delay Deal	The General Motors Corporation and Fiat S.p.A. said yesterday that they had delayed by a year an accord that could have forced General Motors to buy Fiat's unprofitable automotive unit in January because of a dispute over the accord's validity. They will postpone the agreement until Jan. 24, 2005, and put off any legal action related to their differences until Dec. 15, 2004, they said in a joint statement.
10/26/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Express Southern Comfort Ultimate Conversion; Road Show for a Multimedia Family	KEEPING children occupied on a road trip has been a challenge as long as there have been cars. A co-worker packs a five-gallon container with games and activities. I bring along books and handheld video games. Still, on my family's 2002 summer vacation through Montana and Utah, all I heard from the back of my rented minivan was, ''When are we going to get there?'' I bet the pioneers heard the same whines in their covered wagons 150 years ago.
10/25/2003	New Luxury-Car Specifications: Styling. Performance. Aroma.	For Cadillac, the new-car smell, that ethereal scent of factory freshness, is no longer just a product of chance. General Motors recently revealed that its Cadillac division had engineered a scent for its vehicles and had been processing it into the leather seats. The scent -- sort of sweet, sort of subliminal -- was created in a lab, was picked by focus groups and is now the aroma of every new Cadillac put on the road.
10/22/2003	The Motor City And California: Is It Splitsville?	CALIFORNIA and the Motor City used to be the perfect couple. With its freeways and easygoing, put-the-top-down mentality, the Golden State was the car state of the nation -- and the car was most definitely made in America. Can you imagine the Beach Boys singing about imports? (''And she'll have fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the Honda Civic away.'') Or try to envision Hollywood icons of days gone by -- McQueen and the Rat Pack -- in anything but the likes of Fords, Lincolns or Chevys? Of course not. But the freeways got clogged, American cars lost their ring-a-ding-ding and the romance soured. California remains the car state, but about the only new domestic sedans you see on the roads now are from the rental car lots of Avis, Hertz and Budget.
10/22/2003	Unlikely Converts to the Tuner Look, Far From San Diego	WHEN Patrick Dean first began posting photos of his black Saturn SC2 on the Internet four years ago, he knew that it would be no easy task to attract the notice of the import tuner crowd. At the time, typical tuners were young men who lived in Southern California and spent practically every waking minute (not to mention every last cent) customizing their Hondas and Mitsubishis with asphaltgrazing rocker panels, carbon-fiber hoods and bottles of nitrous oxide to fuel the huge boost of speed needed in street drag racing.
10/22/2003	Tale of the Tape: Different Sizes, Similar Passions	HUMMERS and Minis. These specialty cars, which are relatively new to the marketplace, are driven by two very different kinds of customers, right? After all, the Hummer H2, which is like SpongeBob SquarePants on steroids, is not playing the same game as the Powerpuff Girl of the Mini Cooper. Not exactly. As it turns out, drivers of the gas-guzzling, flashy, 6,400-pound behemoth H2 and the fuel-efficient, equally flashy but teeny-tiny 2,314-pound Mini have more in common than they would probably like to admit.
10/22/2003	Leased and Abandoned: Revolt of the EV-1 Lovers	TWO summers ago, Peter Horton drove home in the car of his dreams. Mr. Horton, a star of ''Thirtysomething,'' had signed a three-year lease with General Motors for a Saturn EV-1 electric car, joining 800 other California and Arizona drivers behind the wheel of the most energy-efficient, lowest-emission vehicle ever produced by an American manufacturer. Mr. Horton will not have it much longer.
10/21/2003	Seattle's Transit District Buys 235 Hybrid Buses	King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, plans to buy 235 diesel hybrid buses for its transit system, one of the largest orders for city buses with hybrid technology. The King County Metropolitan Transit Authority plans to spend about $47 million more for the hybrids than it would have for conventional diesel buses. County managers say they think they will save $27 million over 12 years by using less fuel and oil and reducing maintenance costs, though savings from new technologies can be hard to predict.
10/21/2003	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Stronger Yen Urged	Japan should stop deliberately weakening its currency and permit it to rise, John M. Devine, the vice chairman and chief financial officer of General Motors, said. By buying dollars to weaken the yen, Japan is making it easier for its auto parts makers and car assemblers to export goods to the United States, he said. Ken Belson (NYT)
10/20/2003	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; GTO Is Still Flexing Its Muscle	THERE may never be a resolution to the argument over what traits define a muscle car or when Detroit's golden age of high performance began, but there is no question which car best embodies the spirit of the era: the Pontiac GTO. Conceived before emissions regulations and federal safety standards profoundly changed the nature of the car business, the GTO nevertheless arrived under murky circumstances, essentially flying below the corporate radar at General Motors. Alongside G.M.'s 1963 ban on factory participation in racing, company policy included an edict against large-displacement engines as standard equipment in intermediate-size cars. But a wily trio -- John Z. DeLorean, the chief engineer of Pontiac; Elliot Estes, the company's general manager; and Jim Wangers, an account executive for Pontiac's advertising agency -- saved the day.
10/20/2003	The Heroes Amid the Goats In GTO History	IT is hard, though not impossible, to pick a clunker from the short run of the Pontiac GTO. Choosing the ideal example to acquire is a matter of setting priorities: early editions have the classic look; the next generation delivers more horsepower; and the final editions, though hobbled by emissions controls, at least have novelty and affordability in their favor. Many current GTO owners are long-time enthusiasts who could not afford Goats when they were new, though the deep pockets of aging boomers have caused prices to soar. The important thing, aficionados say, is to avoid modified or poorly maintained cars.
10/17/2003	G.M. to Sell Wider Range Of Vehicles In China	General Motors is expanding the range of models and brands it sells in China, with plans to offer a hierarchy of divisions from Chevrolet to Cadillac as it does in the United States, G.M. executives said here this week. G.M.'s auto finance subsidiary, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, also plans to enter the Chinese market soon to offer car loans.
10/16/2003	G.M. Profit Beats Estimates, With Aid of Finance Unit	General Motors, which sells more cars and trucks than any other company in the world, continues to make more money as a bank than as an automaker. On Wednesday, G.M. released its third-quarter earnings report, which reflected its current position as the strongest among the weak Big Three traditional domestic automakers.
10/14/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Electronic Data To Sell Part Of Software Unit	The Electronic Data Systems Corporation said yesterday that it might sell part of a unit that makes software that General Motors and Ford Motor use to design, build and deliver cars. A public share sale or minority investor may be sought for the PLM Solutions unit, Electronic Data said in a statement. PLM, whose name stands for product life-cycle management, employs 5,000 people. Electronic Data is selling some operations to raise cash and focus on its main business of managing computer systems for other businesses. PLM's second-quarter sales fell 10 percent, to $205 million, while companywide revenue rose 2.4 percent to $5.52 billion with help from the dollar's falling value. Electronic Data, based in Plano, Tex., said in June that it would eliminate 2,700 jobs and sell some businesses to trim $5.83 billion in long-term debt. Shares of Electronic Data rose 28 cents, to $21.84.
10/4/2003	Hummers To Harleys	If I had any brains I'd make a big investment in Mack Trucks, because Mack now has an opportunity to extend its brand into all sorts of hugely profitable product lines. I foresee a chain of Mack Trucks tapas restaurants, Mack Trucks brand tub tea and Mack Trucks exfoliating sponges for men. There may even be growth possibilities for the trucks themselves, for what else are people going to buy when they start feeling cramped in their Hummers? I had this insight when I realized that we now have this huge population of Manly Upscale Proles. These are people who, in an effort to prove they are not really as boring as they seem, are getting tattooed up. They're listening to Eminem. And they are trying to show that while they may look like soft information-age office-park jockeys, they are actually dangerous working-class rebels at heart.
10/2/2003	Buyers Cash In on Offers to Keep Car Sales Strong	September auto sales slowed from August but continued to show strength, surprising analysts. Customers took advantage of the latest price war. Last month, General Motors was giving away Dell computers to Saturn buyers, in addition to the usual offer of zero-percent financing and big rebates that were heaviest on remaining 2003 models.
9/27/2003	General Motors Names New Chief of Design	Ed Welburn, who helped oversee the design of the Hummer H2 and Chevrolet SSR, was named by General Motors as its chief design executive today, only the sixth one in the automaker's 95-year history. Mr. Welburn, who joined G.M. in 1972, will succeed Wayne Cherry as vice president for design, North America. He will take over on Oct. 1, the company said, and Mr. Cherry will retire on Jan. 1 after assisting in the transition.
9/26/2003	Automakers Sue Over Asbestos Maneuver	The three largest United States automakers have sued to block Honeywell International Inc. from transferring its Bendix brake unit to the bankrupt Federal-Mogul Corporation, contending the transaction would unfairly saddle the car companies with increased asbestos liabilities. Honeywell seeks to use the transaction to extricate itself from more than 50,000 asbestos lawsuits against Bendix. Federal-Mogul filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2001 to resolve about 360,000 asbestos suits and future claims by establishing a trust to pay victims. Claims against Bendix would be channeled into the trust, possibly freeing Honeywell from liability.
9/23/2003	Auto Deal or Bust	Last week, the United Automobile Workers offered more concessions to the Big Three than it has in the last two decades of contract talks. Then again, concessions have not really been a feature of the last two decades of contract talks in the American auto industry. While auto workers see a contract that extends a lifeline to the struggling Big Three, Wall Street sees baby steps that amount to a glass half-full in some minds and fully empty in others.
9/23/2003	Privacy Law In California Shields Drivers	California today adopted the nation's first law meant to protect the privacy of drivers whose cars are equipped with ''black boxes,'' or data recorders that can be used to gather vital information on how a vehicle is being driven in the last seconds before a crash. Gov. Gray Davis signed the law, which takes effect on July 1, requiring carmakers to disclose the existence of such devices and forbidding access to the data without either a court order or the owner's permission, unless it is for a safety study in which the information cannot be traced back to the car.
9/21/2003	Business People; Couture Update: 3 Deals, 3 Looks For U.A.W.'s Chief	Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers, made an industrial fashion statement last week: he donned buttoned-down shirts with the union's logo to announce deals with Detroit's Big Three. At Chrysler, Mr. Gettelfinger wore blue, collar and all. At Ford, however, he showed up in a flattering camel-colored shirt that complemented the brown double-breasted suit coat and tie worn by the company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr. To reach a deal with General Motors, Mr. Gettelfinger chose blue-and-white stripes, which nicely set off his bright white mustache.
9/19/2003	G.M. Accord Finishes Talks For U.A.W.	The United Automobile Workers union concluded its contract negotiations with the Big Three and two major suppliers today after granting its most significant concessions in two decades. The deals, which will result in thousands of job cuts as roughly a dozen plants are closed or sold, reflect the broad competitive struggles of domestic manufacturers, and the union's effort to balance the desires of its members with the shrinking market share and profits of the automakers.
9/19/2003	G.M. Plant Will Remain Open Until 2007, Union Says	Workers at the General Motors plant in Linden, N.J., which faced a permanent shutdown by 2005, got yet another reprieve that would keep it open into 2007 as a result of a tentative settlement reached yesterday between the company and the United Auto Workers, a union official said. Guy Messina, president of Local 595 of the United Auto Workers, the union that represents workers at the 65-year-old plant, said he had been informed of that portion of the tentative settlement by officials of the international union.
9/18/2003	After Deals With 2 of Big Three, Auto Union Still Talking to G.M.	The United Automobile Workers continued contract negotiations today with General Motors and Delphi, the parts giant spun off from G.M. in 1999. On Monday, the union announced tentative four-year agreements with the other two Big Three domestic automakers, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler.
9/18/2003	Saturn to End Sponsorship Deal	While Lance Armstrong of the United States Postal Service team has dominated international cycling by winning the last five Tours de France, the Saturn team has quietly dominated the sport at home. Today, after its most successful racing year ever, the Saturn Corporation will announce that it is ending its 12-year sponsorship of its men's and women's teams. Tom Schuler, the 1987 United States professional champion and for the last 10 years the director of the Saturn teams, said the auto manufacturer plans new approaches to marketing.
9/17/2003	Tough Times Force U.A.W. To Employ New Strategy	The nearly simultaneous deals the United Automobile Workers union announced Monday with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group represent a sharp break with tradition and underscore how tough times are for the Big Three and their suppliers. Terms of the four-year labor contracts keep the union workers' generous health care benefits largely intact, but the union gave ground on other important issues, including scaling back wage increases and selectively lifting a ban on plant closings, according to people with knowledge of the deals.
9/16/2003	Labor Pacts Reached at Ford and Chrysler	The Ford Motor Company and the auto parts giant Visteon said late this evening that they had reached tentative agreement on four-year labor contracts with the United Automobile Workers union. The Ford deal was the second announced today between the union and a Big Three automaker, an unusually swift resolution to the talks that reflects union leaders' realization of the competitive difficulties faced by the Big Three, whose domestic market share fell to a record monthly low in August.
9/12/2003	Big 3 and Union Said to Be Near One Deal for All	The Big Three and the United Automobile Workers are on the brink of an unprecedented early and simultaneous resolution to their contract talks, people close to the negotiations said. The parties are looking to wrap up negotiations before midnight Sunday, when the four-year labor contracts expire. Reaching an accord at all three companies would be a historic sign of unity between the union and management, but time is running short and hiccups have a way of derailing negotiations.
9/12/2003	Big Hopes for Filling China's Garages	Canvas the top automotive executives at the Frankfurt International Motor Show about what gives them hope for their industry's future, and the answer is the same: China. With their home countries in the doldrums, and the outlook for 2004 scarcely better, the eyes of the world's automakers are fixed firmly on the market in China, where sales of cars and trucks are rocketing.
9/11/2003	Spots for the Hummer and the hybrid Prius, opposites on the road.	SOME car ads play nice, some play naughty. In recent weeks, the Hummer division of General Motors has been running an inventive television ad, by Modernista of Boston, that shows a boy building a wooden Hummer and using it to win a soapbox derby. He overcomes his more pedestrian rivals by ignoring the winding race course and lumbering straight downhill, all to the tune of The Who's ''Happy Jack.''
9/8/2003	Chrysler and G.M. Resume Union Talks	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, which has told its union that it may need additional job cuts to stem losses, and General Motors resumed labor negotiations yesterday on a new contract. Ford Motor took the day off. Negotiations between the companies and the United Auto Workers recessed Saturday night after around-the-clock talks since Sept. 3.
9/4/2003	With a Torrid Month, Toyota Moves Ahead of Chrysler in Sales	The day that the American automobile industry has been dreading for years arrived today. Toyota outsold Chrysler in August, the first time one of Detroit's Big Three has fallen to fourth place. Toyota's accomplishment capped the hottest month of the year thus far for the industry, though overall sales dropped about 1 percent from August 2002, the best month last year, according to figures from Ward's Automotive Reports. Foreign car makers smashed sales records last month, but General Motors' sales were virtually unchanged from August 2002; Chrysler fell 6 percent and sales at Ford Motor plunged 13 percent from last year.
8/31/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Cadillac XLR; At Last, Blue Skies for Cadillac	THE first Cadillac XLR will not be delivered to its first customer until next month, but it is not too early to declare the two-seat luxury roadster a success, at least in some respects. The 2004 XLR has contributed to a growing buzz for General Motors' premium car division after a long lethargic period in which Cadillac seemed ready for the retirement home. In an audacious challenge that would have seemed unthinkable not long ago, the $76,200 XLR takes dead aim at one of the best cars from Mercedes-Benz, the SL500, after decades in which Cadillac essentially abandoned the high-end luxury market.
8/31/2003	American Idol? Auditions Start	SO, thousands of people line up for an opportunity to warble pop songs in front of abusive judges and heartless television viewers, for a slim chance of gaining fame, fortune and a recording contract. Any car that aspires to become an American idol should have it so easy. In fact, since Detroit virtually ceased to compete in some of the sexy sectors of the vehicle market, like luxury cars and sporty roadsters, American-born automotive icons -- think of the original Ford Thunderbird, the postwar Chrysler woodies or the Pontiac GTO -- have rarely been anointed.
8/27/2003	Car Sales Slow Despite Spending on Incentives	In another sign of how competitive the car market has become, auto companies spent a record amount on incentives in July, yet their vehicles sat unsold on dealers' lots for a record length of time. Moreover, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Corporation lost market share in July, though the average incentives for Detroit's auto companies grew to the highest level ever, according to Edmunds.com, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that offers consumers buying advice and tracks industry trends.
8/26/2003	People	Patrick N. Palmer was named to the new post of executive vice president and chief strategic and planning officer at Chemistri, Troy, Mich., a division of the Publicis Groupe that works on General Motors accounts like Cadillac and Pontiac. Mr. Palmer had been chief strategic officer at on accounts like Red Lobster and Sara Lee at Euro RSCG Tatham Partners, Chicago, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas, as well as managing director for Euro RSCG Tatham's brand consulting division.
8/24/2003	On the Way: A Bumper Crop	AMERICANS bought 38,000 gas-electric hybrid vehicles last year, and sales are likely to reach 54,000 in 2003, according to a recent study by J.D. Power & Associates, the big market-research firm. That is only the beginning, if J.D. Power's predictions pan out: the firm expects 500,000 annual hybrid sales by 2008 and 872,000 by 2013. Since only three hybrid cars are currently available, reaching those lofty figures will require new varieties of hybrids -- and they are certainly on the way.
8/23/2003	GENERAL MOTORS EXPECTS HUGHES SALE TO BE APPROVED	The General Motors Corporation, which is raising cash for its pension plans, said it expected shareholders to approve the $3.8 billion sale of its stake in Hughes Electronics to the News Corporation by early October. The Securities and Exchange Commission declared the proxy statement for the transaction effective Thursday, clearing the way for the vote, the company said. The News Corporation agreed in April to buy a controlling 34 percent stake in Hughes and its DirecTV satellite television service for $6.6 billion. General Motors owns 19.8 percent of Hughes's tracking stock.
8/14/2003	Cleaner Air, Courtesy of California	At a time when neither Congress nor the administration seems interested in significantly improving automobile efficiency, California has kept up the good fight and has now won an important victory. The Times's Danny Hakim reported this week that General Motors and DaimlerChrysler had agreed to drop their lawsuits against a California rule requiring automakers to produce millions of cleaner, more efficient ''hybrid'' vehicles -- cars powered by a combination of gasoline and electricity -- over the next 15 years. Since other states, like New York, often follow California's lead in these matters, such vehicles may in time be available everywhere. This, in turn, could lead to progress not only on cleaner air but also on global warming and the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil. At issue was California's 1990 zero-emission rule, which decreed that 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state from 2003 to 2008 be pollution-free. That essentially meant electric cars, but since these have turned out to be a commercial dead end, California wisely extended the deadline and invited the industry to meet part of its quota with hybrids. The industry, which hates quotas, went to court, arguing that the rule was merely a backdoor way of setting new fuel economy standards, a federal prerogative. California retorted that it was interested only in reducing air pollution and that improved mileage would be a serendipitous byproduct.
8/12/2003	AUTOMAKERS DROP SUITS ON AIR RULES	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are dropping lawsuits against California over a landmark clean-air regulation that requires the production of millions of low-emission cars and trucks over the next decade and a half. The move creates a temporary but momentous environmental truce between the auto industry, which has blocked the zero-emission vehicle mandate that was set in motion in 1990, and California, which wields enormous influence over the global industry.
8/8/2003	Chevrolet Aims to Take Lead From Ford With Nine New Models	The Chevrolet division of General Motors plans to introduce nine new models over 20 months, starting in January, setting up a battle to overtake the Ford brand as the nation's top seller. ''This product barrage should help get Chevy back to selling three million cars and trucks a year,'' said Gary L. Cowger, president of G.M.'s North American operations.
8/3/2003	Is Saturn Ready for Its Close-Up?	TO Joan Rivers Jewelry, Quacker Factory apparel and the Nesco Deluxe Deep Fryer, add another brand name to the prime-time lineup on QVC: Saturn. On Tuesday night, the QVC home-shopping network, which draws 80 million viewers a week, is broadcasting a segment called ''Car Shopping, Saturn Style.'' QVC watchers won't actually buy Ions or Vues during the show, which starts at 10 p.m. Eastern time (after a promotion featuring ''Thomas Kinkade, painter of light''). For that, they still have to go to a local dealer.
8/3/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Pontiac Grand Prix; The Emperor Has No Cladding	PONTIAC'S advertising declares that the Grand Prix has been ''reborn'' for the 2004 model year. But from the driver's seat, it seems a little early to be handing out cigars. True, the new Grand Prix is sculpturally distinct from the previous model. The sheet metal has been drawn back, as if in a ducktail hairstyle, to give the four-door sedan the handsome and sporty look of a two-door coupe. (The Grand Prix coupe has been discontinued.) The exterior and interior surfaces have been simplified and tightened. The thigh-high plastic body cladding, tacky hood scoops and bodacious spoilers are gone, banished by General Motors' product czar, Robert A. Lutz, who joined G.M. not quite two years ago and made the revival of Pontiac a top priority.
8/2/2003	Vehicle Sales Dipped in July For Big Three	American consumers gave the auto industry its best month of the year in July. Unfortunately for Detroit, they did so by buying vehicles with foreign nameplates. General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler all said today that their sales of cars and trucks fell last month, even though the companies are collectively offering the biggest incentives ever.
8/1/2003	Dream Car? Don't Count On Driving Anywhere	TAKING the wheel of a car priced at, say, a year's income is sobering enough, even if trying out new cars is part of your job. Driving one that is valued in the millions is another proposition entirely. But it can prove irresistible. How many drivers, after all, ever have a chance to go out for a spin in one of the auto industry's multimillion-dollar babies, its prized concept cars? These are the imaginative models seen at auto shows or in glossy magazine pictures, billed as what might be the next big thing in car design but not actually on anybody's production schedule. Often, concept cars push the edges of design, incorporating looks and features that are new and exciting. Sometimes they are quirky curiosities, intriguing in their own way.
7/31/2003	Fleet Trading Unit Agrees to Pay Fine	The FleetBoston Financial Corporation will pay the New York Stock Exchange a fine of $150,000, and its chief trader in General Motors stock will pay $25,000 to settle accusations that the bank's market-making unit violated trading rules. The bank's Fleet Specialist unit failed to display orders within the exchange's 28-second deadline, a Fleet spokesman, Charles Salmans, said yesterday. Separately, Michael Bonnano, the G.M. market-maker, failed to buy shares as required when they fell almost 6 percent in three minutes on June 27, 2002. Later that day, he sold his shares instead of matching customer orders.
7/29/2003	People	* Rob Palmer was named to the new post of executive creative director on the account of Cadillac at Chemistri, Troy, Mich., a division of the Publicis Groupe dedicated to working for the Cadillac, Pontiac and the service and parts units of General Motors. Mr. Palmer had been creative director at Wieden & Kennedy, Portland, Ore. * Andy Hopson was named to the new post of president and chief executive for the Northeast region, as well as market leader for New York, at Burson-Marsteller, New York. Mr. Hopson since 1998 had been president and chief operating officer at Publicis Dialog U.S., New York, part of the Publicis Groupe. Burson-Marsteller is part of WPP. * Bill Schoonmaker was named to the new post of vice president and management director at 361degrees Sports and Event Marketing, New York. He had been senior vice president for the North American Sponsorship Marketing practice at the Chicago office of Prism, part of the WPP Group. 361degrees Sports is a unit of Foote, Cone & Belding, part of the FCB Group division of the Interpublic Group. * Robert D. Liodice was named president and chief executive at the Association of National Advertisers, New York, a post he has filled on an interim basis since January, when John J. Sarsen Jr. retired.
7/29/2003	A campaign by the Sierra Club chides General Motors about the Hummer's gas mileage.	ROBERT LUTZ, the cigar-wielding vice chairman and product czar for General Motors, has said that G.M. needs to stir passion by making ''love them or hate them'' vehicles. The Hummer, the current ''it'' sport utility vehicle in the creeping culture war over the S.U.V., certainly fits the bill.
7/18/2003	G.M.'s Net Income Declined 30% in Second Quarter	General Motors reported a 30 percent decline in second-quarter net income today, in large part because of falling vehicle sales in North America coupled with a price war that continues to escalate. G.M.'s results were also hurt by $168 million in costs from a tornado in May that shut down the company's Oklahoma City assembly plant for nearly two months. The plant makes midsize sport utility vehicles like the Chevrolet Trailblazer.
7/15/2003	Their Health Costs Soaring, Automakers Are to Begin Labor Talks	The Big Three automakers, which open contract talks with the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday, are making a bigger issue out of reducing medical costs than they have in years. But the union has staked out health insurance as untouchable. ''We're not going to share costs,'' said Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W. president, at a recent news briefing.
7/15/2003	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Murdoch Seeks Software Stake	Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation will offer to buy up to 20 percent of Hughes Software Systems, an Indian communications software subsidiary of the Hughes Electronics Corporation, the Bombay Stock Exchange announced. The offer is related to plans by the News Corporation to buy a controlling stake in Hughes Electronics from General Motors. Hughes Electronics owns DirecTV, the broadcast satellite service. Securities regulations in India require that stockholders be given the opportunity to sell their shares when there is a change in control of a company. Saritha Rai (NYT)
7/10/2003	Report Faults Big Companies On Climate	Many of the world's largest companies are doing a poor job of preparing for the business impact of global warming, a report issued yesterday by investor, environmental and public interest groups said. Most of the 20 corporate giants discussed, including leaders in the oil, auto and utility industries, are also failing to disclose to investors enough about the financial risks they face from climate change, according to the report, which was prepared by the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.
7/9/2003	American Cars Show Gains In a Survey of Dependability	Mercedes-Benz has fallen behind its sister brand Chrysler in a closely watched report on vehicle dependability, while General Motors has surged. And Japanese vehicles continue, over all, to hold up the best. The report, issued today by J. D. Power & Associates, focuses on problems that arise over three years of ownership. Its rankings are important because most consumers say a vehicle's reputation for long-term durability is their top consideration in buying.
7/3/2003	McCann Picks Director Of G.M. Account	Garry Neel, 48, managing director at the Troy, Mich., office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, was named yesterday to an added post, worldwide account director for the General Motors Corporation. Mr. Neel, who has managed the office since 2000, will also work with McCann-Erickson executives who handle General Motors accounts in 45 countries. The Troy office works for the Buick division of G.M. and creates corporate ads.
7/3/2003	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Increase In Auto Output	The General Motors Corporation said it planned to expand production at a venture in Shanghai to meet increasing demand for vehicles in China. Shanghai GM, the company's venture with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, China's biggest carmaker, has capacity to make 100,000 vehicles a year and is ''currently running at full capacity in two shifts,'' General Motors said. The expansion is subject to government approval.
7/2/2003	4% Rise in Auto Sales in June Fuels Optimism at the Big Three	Nationwide auto sales rose in June, but the domestic industry continued to lose ground to foreign competitors like Toyota despite spending heavily on consumer purchase incentives. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company were upbeat in conference calls today, though, saying that they saw positive signs for industry sales in the second half of the year.
7/2/2003	Employers Seek To Shift Costs Of Drugs to U.S.	The bills to provide drug benefits through Medicare that were passed by the House and the Senate last week offer some of the country's largest employers a long-sought prize: shifting at least some of their burden of soaring drug costs to the federal government. With billions of dollars at stake, those companies are lobbying hard to make sure that those gains survive in the final version of the law.
7/1/2003	Market Place; G.M. Profit Gets Lift From Pension Deal	You might think that a company selling $13.1 billion of bonds to raise cash for its needy pension fund would be losing money. But it turns out that a company can actually book millions of dollars of profit on such a deal, thanks to the peculiar rules that govern pension accounting. The recent bond issue by General Motors shows how the alchemy works. The automaker completed the big sale last week and said it would contribute most of the proceeds to its retirement plans later this year. After booking the bond sale and pension activity, in accordance with accounting rules, G.M. will end up with a gain -- a small one for 2003, because the pension contribution will be close to the end of the year.
6/29/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Chevrolet Corvette; At 50, You Should Look So Good	THE Chevrolet Corvette, a balm applied to countless egos bruised by midlife crisis, is celebrating its own 50th birthday this weekend in Nashville with caravans, parades, vintage-car displays and a rock concert. To reach the half-century mark, America's iconic sports car has persevered through trying times, starting with a so-what initial reception from buyers and, in later years, the upheaval created by antipollution regulations, all the while fending off rivals' repeated attempts to dethrone it. No matter that the Corvette never had to endure the creepy menu on some tropical island, or nerves boiled to the breaking point in an Amazon jungle. Chevy's two-seater is a bona fide survivor, having outlasted earnest contenders that were, at times, faster performing, better handling and lower priced. And although it represents the wane of the fifth-generation model, the 2003 Corvette is both tautly athletic on the street and thriving on the sales charts, posting its best-ever month in April (with a little help from manufacturer incentives, admittedly).
6/29/2003	Psst! Want to See the Next 'Vette?	AS the current Corvette nears the end of its production cycle, speculation about its successor is approaching the roar of an engine at the red line. Industry sleuths are digging for clues, enthusiasts are swapping rumors and magazines are promising full disclosure. The fifth-generation car (known to enthusiasts as C5) is due for a makeover, having been introduced for 1997. Dave Hill, vehicle line executive for Corvette, said in a telephone interview that the next car, C6, would make its debut in January at the Detroit auto show and go on sale next summer as a 2005 model.
6/27/2003	G.M. Raises $17.5 Billion In Huge Corporate Bond Sale	General Motors sold $17.5 billion worth of bonds yesterday as investors lined up to buy securities that were yielding as much as four full percentage points over comparable Treasuries. Although the automaker, whose offering ranked among the largest corporate bond sales ever, had to pay about half a percentage point of added interest to attract investors, some analysts said the deal went quite well. Because of the demand, G.M. had already increased the size of the offering by about $4.5 billion.
6/25/2003	Departure From Saatchi And Quick Turnaround	The other shoe dropped yesterday in the abrupt departure of Kurt Ritter from the Torrance, Calif., office of Saatchi & Saatchi. He said he would open an independent marketing consultancy that will work for the office's biggest client, the Toyota Motor Sales USA division of Toyota Motor. It was disclosed on Monday that Mr. Ritter would leave after only a month as chief executive of the office, where he supervised the Toyota Motor Sales USA account. His departure was prompted by Saatchi & Saatchi's parent, the Publicis Groupe, which hired him from General Motors, where he had most recently been general manager of the Buick and Pontiac divisions.
6/24/2003	A quick retreat from a plan to put a longtime G.M. manager in charge of Toyota's pitch.	THE PUBLICIS GROUPE is bowing to a rare display of public displeasure from a large client, the General Motors Corporation, by taking the unusual step of undoing the recent hiring of a top executive. The executive, Kurt Ritter, joined a big Publicis agency last month, after working more than 30 years for G.M., to oversee the account of a competing automaker, Toyota Motor, at a Publicis agency. Now Mr. Ritter is abruptly leaving the agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, where he had been chief executive of the office that handles the American Toyota account, to placate G.M.
6/24/2003	Companies See Law School Ruling as a Way to Help Keep the Diversity Pipeline Open	The Supreme Court's rulings yesterday about diversity in higher education sent a strong signal to the nation's employers that they can continue to use race as a factor in hiring, corporate executives and employment law experts said. In ruling on the admissions policies of the University of Michigan Law School, the court's majority opinion, written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, cited the views put forward by General Motors and other companies in friend-of-the-court briefs that said achieving diversity was essential at universities and in workplaces to compete in an increasingly global marketplace.
6/21/2003	G.M. to Raise $10 Billion For Pension Gap	General Motors said today that it would borrow $10 billion by selling bonds and other securities, and would use substantially all of the money to reduce its pension deficit of more than $19 billion. The bond sale, which would be one of the largest ever and which would be open to buyers worldwide, would allow it to accelerate its effort to finance its United States pension plans, according to a G.M. statement.
6/20/2003	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Auto Mall Set For Harlem	With the Rev. Jesse Jackson looking on, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and General Motors executives announced yesterday that the company would invest in a multidealer auto mall in East Harlem that the Potamkin Auto Group is building. The dealership, planned for a city-owned lot on 127th Street between Second and Third Avenues, will be the first north of 60th Street in more than 40 years, city officials said. General Motors is planning a Chevrolet and a Saturn franchise, with at least 250 jobs. Cadillac and Hummer are also expected to be in the mall. Randal C. Archibold (NYT)
6/19/2003	U.S. Automakers Improve Efficiency, But Some Troubling Figures Remain	With every piece of good news about the Big Three comes another reminder of how wide the competitive gap with Japan remains. Today, a report on manufacturing efficiency in North American auto plants last year showed encouraging results for American automakers. General Motors continued to make impressive strides toward closing the productivity gap with Japanese automakers. And the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler, the least productive of the six largest automakers in North America, had the industry's best year-over-year improvement in 2002.
6/18/2003	G.M. SETS FURTHER CUT IN OUTPUT OF SATURN ION	General Motors will stop producing the Saturn Ion small car for two extra weeks because of slower-than-expected sales of the auto's sedan model. The company, which is based in Detroit, will halt an assembly line at its Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., for four weeks, starting June 23, including two previously scheduled weeks for the company's nationwide annual summer shutdown. Ion production will resume July 21, said Sherrie Childers-Arb, a spokeswoman.
6/8/2003	Fighting a Price War By Cutting Prices? Never	Paul Ballew, the chief market analyst at General Motors, is rewriting the dictionary when it comes to the sales vocabulary of the auto industry. According to Mr. Ballew, the industry shouldn't be talking about incentives. He prefers the word ''pricing.''
6/8/2003	A Cry in the Wilderness, or Just a Good Cry?	Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, famously admonished the auto industry in January to ''stop whining'' about the interest-free loans and other incentives that automakers were offering to spur sales. The remark wasn't directed specifically at Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive at Chrysler, but Mr. Zetsche wants Mr. Wagoner to know he got the message.
6/1/2003	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a brief report in the Private Sector column last Sunday about Stars and Cars, a charity event in Detroit, misstated the career path of Robert A. Lutz, the co-chairman. He left Chrysler in 1998, then joined Exide Technologies; he was hired by General Motors in 2001 as a vice chairman. He did not join G.M. directly from Chrysler.
5/29/2003	Dear Customer, G.M. Says, We've Improved	General Motors is ready to try the redemption card. After lagging in quality rankings for years and long making cars that all looked alike, the company is preparing a provocative corporate image campaign that says it has turned over a new leaf and wants another chance.
5/25/2003	Private Sector; Chances Are, Led Zeppelin Still Sells More Cadillacs	Robert A. Lutz, a vice chairman of General Motors, is known as one of the hippest men in the car business, one reason G.M. hired him away from Chrysler three years ago. Since his arrival, G.M. has been trying to liven up its image, for example by using music by Led Zeppelin in its Cadillac commercials. Given Mr. Lutz's appeal, it's not surprising that he is co-chairman of the second annual Stars and Cars benefit on June 6 at the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts in Detroit, where G.M. will get a chance to show off its latest models.
5/23/2003	8 Cylinders, As Needed	When it's time to merge into a fast-moving lane of traffic, there's nothing so reassuring as the power reserve of a brawny V-8 engine. The downside is paying to fuel those eight cylinders when you have caught up to the traffic and need only the power of four to maintain the pace. General Motors will soon begin building vehicles using a technology called displacement on demand, which may offer the best of both worlds. The engine is programmed to shut down half of the cylinders when it senses a light load. It not only cuts off fuel and ignition spark to the unneeded cylinders, but deactivates the valves -- the engine's breathing apparatus -- for them. When the driver presses on the accelerator or sensors detect an uphill grade, all eight cylinders are quickly put back into use.
5/22/2003	Poaching by Publicis Gets G.M. Riled Up	In a rare display of public displeasure, the General Motors Corporation has expressed dismay at the recent hiring by the Publicis Groupe of a senior G.M. executive to oversee the account of a competing carmaker, Toyota Motor, at a Publicis agency. Ryndee Carney, a spokeswoman for G.M. in Detroit, confirmed a report this week in Advertising Age that the company was upset about the hiring, describing executives as ''extremely disappointed.'' She said other parts of the article had ''blown out of proportion'' the company's reaction but she declined to comment further.
5/22/2003	G.M. RAISES REBATES ON SOME MODELS IN THE MIDWEST	The General Motors Corporation raised rebates on some models in parts of the Midwest. Discounts on the company's top-selling Chevrolet Silverado pickup will increase to $4,000 from $3,000; on the Chevrolet TrailBlazer sport utility vehicle to $4,750 from $3,000; and on the Chevrolet Avalanche pickup to $5,000 from $4,000, according to the Chevrolet Web site. A G.M. spokeswoman, Deborah Silverman, declined to comment on the changes, which took effect last night in Michigan and in parts of neighboring states. The discounts end June 2.
5/20/2003	HONDA UNIT WILL STOP LEASING VEHICLES IN 3 STATES	The Honda Motor Company's finance unit said yesterday that it would stop leasing vehicles to residents of New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island in July because of laws that leave leasing companies accountable in traffic accidents. Honda's action follows similar moves by the finance units of General Motors and Ford in response to the so-called vicarious liability laws. Such laws allow a leasing company to be held responsible for accidents caused by customers operating leased vehicles. Honda's unit, the American Honda Finance Corporation, based in Torrance, Calif., is offering customers alternatives to leasing a vehicle, including a $1,500 damage waiver on excess wear and use. The New York Legislature is considering changes to the state's leasing law.
5/18/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Buick Park Avenue Ultra; Portholes Return to Easy St.	FOR much of its first century, Buick was known for elegant, smooth and stylish automobiles that identified their owners as comfortably middle class. Your family physician was likely to make house calls in a Century or a Special, giving rise to the image of Buicks as ''doctors' cars.'' The grandest of these were the Limited and Roadmaster, and later the Electra 225. Those names are gone, but Buick's current flagship, the Park Avenue Ultra, is in the same mode. The biggest Buick now has front drive and a V-6 engine, in contrast to the rear-drive, V-8 cars of the past, but it is still smooth, substantial and as comfortable as an overstuffed recliner. Marcus Welby would feel at home.
5/18/2003	Buick Turns 100, Smoothly	IT has been a remarkable century since David Dunbar Buick incorporated the Buick Motor Company on May 19, 1903, in Detroit, where Buick plans to celebrate its 100th anniversary tomorrow with a ceremony and show of vintage automobiles. Consider these milestones: Shortly after its founding, Buick became the cornerstone of the fledgling General Motors Corporation assembled by William C. Durant. By 1908, Buick was a major manufacturer, producing almost 9,000 cars a year, and by 1923 it had built a million cars.
5/16/2003	G.M. OFFERS SIX-YEAR LOANS ON MOST OF ITS '03 MODELS	General Motors is offering six-year financing at 1.9 percent on most 2003 models, after saying earlier this year that it would limit its use of the longer loans. The new loan program, starting yesterday and ending June 2, covers most Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saturn and Saab cars and trucks, excluding the Chevrolet Corvette, a spokeswoman, Elaine Redd, said yesterday. G.M. said as recently as February that it would offer those loans only on entry-level vehicles like the Chevrolet Cavalier.
5/16/2003	Buick Turns 100, Smoothly Slide Show	
5/7/2003	Whether a Hummer or a Hybrid, The Big Complaint Is Fuel Use	Drivers of Hummers and hybrids have something in common after all. Both are dissatisfied with how much gas their vehicles consume, according to a closely watched survey of initial quality by J. D. Power and Associates released today. Fuel consumption was listed by drivers of both General Motors' Hummer H2 and the fuel-efficient Toyota Prius hybrid as their top complaint -- though Hummer complaints dwarfed those for Prius.
5/3/2003	G.M. Chief Says Sales Need Help	The chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, in his first speech since adding the title of chairman, said today that the price war his company was leading was losing effectiveness and the industry would need a strong economic stimulus package from Washington. ''Consumers are getting a little less sensitive to these incentives and that's why we'd really like to see this economy pick up,'' he said in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club.
5/2/2003	Auto Sales Dropped 6.1% During April	Auto sales for April improved on a sluggish first quarter, receiving a modest bump from a renewed incentive push by the Big Three, but were still below the strong levels of a year ago. ''When one considers the heavy incentives for the month, the sales levels are quite disappointing,'' said Domenic D. Martilotti, an analyst for Bear, Stearns. ''Each iteration of this zero-percent-for-60-months push, there are clearly diminishing returns. So the question is, where do we go from here?''
5/2/2003	Love Me, Love My Car	EVERY car buyer faces difficult questions. Should I buy the extended warranty? Do I need a DVD player? How about alpaca floor mats? But people who purchase a Pontiac Aztek face another head-scratcher: how to respond to passersby who pull up next to them and inform them -- usually in obscene terms -- that their cars are the ugliest things ever to touch asphalt? There is no correct response to the inevitable assault. Joe Garcia, an Allentown, Pa., network administrator who has been driving his Aztek since October 2000, strikes back. ''I used to get upset about it,'' he said in a March telephone interview. ''Now I just say 'Hey, look in the mirror.' ''
4/25/2003	California Regulators Modify Auto Emissions Mandate	California regulators, responding to legal pressure from automakers and the Bush administration, amended a plan today to force the industry to produce clean cars but kept it ambitious enough to please environmental groups. By an 8-to-3 vote, the California Air Resources Board altered the influential Zero Emission Vehicle mandate so it will require fewer vehicles to be sold in California with no tailpipe emissions and more with modest emissions, like hybrids that supplement gasoline with electric power.
4/19/2003	Lockheed Wins Huge Sale to Poland With Complex Deal	Wrapping up the largest arms purchase by a former Soviet-bloc country since the cold war ended, Poland signed contracts today to pay $3.5 billion for 48 F-16 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin. The deal is also notable for including what appears to be the largest so-called offset arrangement yet seen in the international arms trade. In return for ordering the fighters, Poland prevailed on Lockheed to organize a $6.3 billion package of investments in the country by itself and other American companies.
4/17/2003	A Study of Corporate Pension Funds Shows Many Assumed Outsize Gains	The first comprehensive examination of the pension funds of the nation's biggest corporations shows that nearly half made assumptions about their investment returns for 2002 that would be deemed too aggressive by federal regulators, starting this year. Of the 100 companies examined, 45 used an annual rate of return of more than 9 percent, the proposed standard for this year. Eight of the companies assumed that their pension funds would have returns of 10 percent or more. In fact, though, almost all the pension funds examined lost money last year.
4/16/2003	G.M.'s Quarterly Earnings Beat Forecasts	First-quarter earnings at General Motors beat Wall Street's expectations yesterday, but they were viewed skeptically because gains in the company's financing operation, particularly its mortgage business, offset weakness in its automotive operations. G.M. said in a conference call that concerns about the economy persisted even as the war in Iraq appeared to be winding down, leading the company to scale back projections for auto sales and earnings. Executives said the company would have difficulty meeting its 2003 earnings target of $5 a share and warned that second-quarter earnings would come in at $1 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had expected $1.46 a share.
4/15/2003	Trying to Close Technology Divide As Satellite Operators Battle Cable	The recent acquisition of DirecTV by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation adds another piece to his global satellite empire and puts him at the center of a fierce technological battle -- one in which he and other satellite operators have lost the clear advantage they once had over cable competitors. The fray is a technological tit-for-tat in which the satellite companies and cable companies -- vying for the eyes and dollars of viewers -- are investing heavily in technology to offer new interactive entertainment. Each system appears to have its advantages, according to industry analysts, but what is generally accepted is that the satellite operators, including DirecTV, have lost the large technological lead they held in the mid-1990's.
4/14/2003	Liberty Could Benefit From the DirecTV Deal	In early March, Liberty Media's chief operating officer, Gary S. Howard, told investors at a conference that Liberty was considering a bid for DirecTV. The news surprised media industry executives. Liberty, which is controlled by John C. Malone, also owned 18 percent of the News Corporation. Rupert Murdoch, the chief of News Corporation, was angered by the news, according to a veteran media executive who knows both men (although a News Corporation spokesman disagreed with that interpretation). Mr. Murdoch has long wanted to acquire DirecTV and a rival bid from his largest shareholder was hardly helpful. Associates persuaded Mr. Malone to back off. ''John can get a little careless about relationships,'' this person said. ''He just didn't think.'' Mr. Malone could not be reached for comment.
4/14/2003	Murdoch's First Step: Make the Sports Fan Pay	To understand why Rupert Murdoch is buying control of the satellite broadcaster DirecTV, ask fans of the Orlando Magic or the Minnesota Timberwolves. Mr. Murdoch's Fox cable networks have the local television rights to both basketball teams. When Time Warner Cable refused to pay the fees that Fox demanded to carry the channels this year, the company kept the games off cable for 10 weeks of the season. ''I'm a very big Magic fan,'' Shah Jamali, a local lawyer, said in an interview with The Orlando Sentinel. ''I was pretty much ready to switch to a satellite TV service to get my games back.''
4/13/2003	Private Sector; A Car Guy Runs Into Some Critics	Robert A. Lutz, 71, vice chairman of General Motors, has been called ''the ultimate car guy.'' His passion is design, and last Wednesday he was able to share it with a sympathetic crowd, an audience of art and design students at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. He told the crowd that he encouraged boat rockers, and they took him at his word. During a question-and-answer session, students pressed him -- at times aggressively -- on the environmental consequences of the 16-cylinder Cadillac Sixteen, the intimidating size of the Hummer H2 and the power of corporations to influence consumer taste.
4/13/2003	The War Goes Well. So Where's the Dividend?	THE images of military triumph from Baghdad last week, as Saddam Hussein's statue and his regime toppled, brought a measured sigh of relief from the business world. Economists' worst fears about the impact of the Iraqi war had not materialized. American casualties were limited. There were no big oil-field fires, and no terrorist reprisals yet on American soil. So far, so good, it seems. Yet business executives and economists said in interviews last week that while the progress of troops in Iraq was unquestionably good news for the economy, as one source of uncertainty recedes, it remains to be seen whether the battlefield success will prove to have been a turning point. Still unclear is whether consumer confidence and business investment will not only revive from their war-jitter depths but also begin a more sustained recovery.
4/11/2003	Plan to Alter A Yardstick For Pensions	Corporations would find billions of dollars of pension shortfalls eliminated overnight under a proposal being prepared to address a longstanding issue in pension accounting. The proposed legislation, being drafted by a Democrat and a Republican who sponsored changes in retirement laws in 2001, would create a permanent replacement for the 30-year bond in certain pension calculations. An interim measure, allowing companies to use a more favorable rate, is set to expire at the end of the year.
4/11/2003	Shares of Fox Fall 17% on Hughes Deal	Although the News Corporation's acquisition of a controlling stake in DirecTV has been expected for months, investors complained yesterday that the execution of the deal appeared to benefit News Corporation at the expense of both its 80 percent owned subsidiary, Fox Entertainment, and many shareholders of the DirecTV parent, Hughes Electronics. Shares of all three companies tumbled, with the steepest fall for Fox, which declined $4.65 a share, or 17 percent, to $22.60.
4/11/2003	In Brazil, Weak Market Gives Merger Better Chance	The News Corporation's takeover of DirecTV would give Rupert Murdoch control of the two main satellite television operators in Latin America and a virtual monopoly in Brazil, the region's largest market. But analysts say the meager pickings from pay television across the region may help clear many of the potential regulatory objections.
4/11/2003	For EchoStar, the Real Challenge From DirecTV Begins	While Rupert Murdoch and General Motors executives worked out the News Corporation's deal for control of DirecTV, Charles W. Ergen, the chairman of EchoStar, the nation's No. 2 satellite-television company, spent most of this week south of the border. Mr. Ergen was at an undisclosed Mexican location for a previously scheduled conference with senior EchoStar executives and sales agents, said two people close to the company. While the meetings were meant to be all business, Mr. Ergen may have been well advised to take a few minutes to relax in the sun.
4/10/2003	Murdoch Gets Upper Hand On Cable With Hughes Deal	Rupert Murdoch's begging days are over. Six years ago, when Mr. Murdoch was starting the Fox News Channel, he was reduced to pleading with Time Warner Cable to carry it in New York, reportedly offering more than $100 million to the company and eventually enlisting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki in a political battle to get Fox on the air.
4/10/2003	News Corp. Adds to Empire With Control of DirecTV	Completing the final piece in Rupert Murdoch's global satellite empire, the News Corporation agreed yesterday to buy control of Hughes Electronics and its DirecTV satellite operation from General Motors in a deal valued at $6.6 billion. The deal will give Mr. Murdoch even more power in determining what programs are beamed to television sets across the United States and how much consumers pay for them.
4/10/2003	The Tracking Stock Idea Goes Into Retirement at G.M.	General Motors, the originator of tracking stock, is retiring its last such issue in a deal that treats G.M. quite differently from the investors who bought the stock. The parent gets a lot of cash and a higher price for its shares in Hughes Electronics. The public shareholders get paper. G.M. will get $3.3 billion in cash, and a stake in the News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's holding company, from the disposal of Hughes Electronics, whose principal asset is the DirecTV satellite television business.
4/9/2003	G.M. Board Set to Sell Control Of Hughes Unit to News Corp.	The board of General Motors is planning to meet today to approve a deal worth about $7 billion that would give control of its Hughes Electronics unit and the DirecTV satellite operation to the News Corporation, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday. The executives said the deal, if approved, could be announced as early as today.
4/9/2003	G.M. AND BMW TO ANNOUNCE JOINT VENTURE ON FUEL CELLS	General Motors and BMW plan to announce today a joint venture to develop liquid hydrogen as a fuel for cars, a person close to the plan said yesterday. Hydrogen is used to power fuel cells, a clean power system that President Bush has envisioned as replacing gasoline-powered cars in future generations. G.M. and BMW have developed fuel cell prototypes, and BMW has developed other prototypes with internal combustion engines that run on hydrogen instead of gasoline. The two companies said they planned to start selling affordable vehicles powered by fuel cells by 2010. Danny Hakim (NYT)
4/7/2003	Cablevision Is Said to Drop Out of Bidding for DirecTV	Cablevision Systems has abandoned its plan to bid for Hughes Electronics and its DirecTV satellite television operation, people close to the company said yesterday, leaving Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation as the sole suitor for Hughes. Cablevision's decision, which was made late Friday, came a few days after SBC Communications also decided to drop out of the bidding for control of Hughes, which is a unit of General Motors.
4/6/2003	Hummer H2: An Army Of One	LIKE an Art Deco skyscraper or a top 40 dance hit, a car is a time capsule for the age that produced it. Is there a better symbol of the na?ve optimism of the Eisenhower years than the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado, its exuberant, erotic tailfins puncturing the homogenity of the 50's, pointing toward a new era of space exploration, sexual liberation and technological revolution? When future generations look back, they may well see the Hummer H2 as the four-wheel icon of our time. With troops at war and gasoline prices gyrating, with civilians stockpiling gas masks and duct tape to ward off unseen perils, with capitalists and environmentalists squaring off over the attractions and evils of S.U.V.'s, these hulking quasi-military utility vehicles are hardly irrelevant to the national discourse.
4/5/2003	In Their Hummers, Right Beside Uncle Sam	While the Humvees are lined up in the desert, their cousins, the Hummers, continue to be Detroit's hottest seller. Is it because of, or in spite of, the war? Sales of several other large sport utility vehicles, like the Chevrolet Suburban, are showing signs of weakness while overall sales remain strong for other S.U.V.'s.
4/2/2003	Detroit on a Mission: No Slip in Auto Sales	Auto sales continued their sluggish pace last month, according to figures released today, prompting the Big Three automakers to broaden their no-interest loan offers. Sales actually fell less than many analysts had expected in March, just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and cars were still selling at a fairly healthy rate. But automakers are clearly worried enough to offer a new round of deals that General Motors called unprecedented, setting up a test for the industry in April.
4/1/2003	GENERAL MOTORS EXTENDS NO-INTEREST LOANS TO 5 YEARS	General Motors said yesterday that it would extend no-interest loans to five years on most of its models in April because of a slower-than-expected March, going beyond what it did to aid sales after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. G.M. said it would offer the loans on all 2003 Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn cars and trucks, excluding only two Hummer sport utility models. After 9/11, it offered no-interest loans for five years on certain 2001 car models and for three years on all other 2001 and 2002 car and truck models. G.M. scaled back no-interest loans on March 1.
3/28/2003	Corrections	A map in Science Times on Tuesday with an article about the effect of PCB contamination on fish in the Hudson River misidentified the company whose plant was a source of the pollution. It was G.E., not G.M.
3/23/2003	An Alternative to Squaring Off	THE recent announcement by Sleepy Hollow officials that a 150-room hotel, 1,562 units of housing and small shops will be built on the former General Motors site is an important step that could revitalize this 97-acre parcel. The project will also generate a tremendous amount of traffic, with an impact on Tarrytown residents. This proposal could lead to a struggle between neighboring communities. Plans are in the works to develop Ridge Hill in Yonkers, which is on the border with Greenburgh. This 84-acre property, at exit 6A in Yonkers offf the New York State Thruway, may be developed for retail, offices, residential and hospitality uses. There is talk of plans to provide better access from Ridge Hill to the Austin Avenue development (current home of Stew Leonard's). Much of the Austin Avenue traffic currently uses Greenburgh streets. Another major project could have significant and negative traffic implications for Greenburgh residents.
3/23/2003	Vision Is There; Now for the Focus	SEVEN years after General Motors shut down its auto assembly plant in North Tarrytown, the company and its chosen developer have shared a new vision for the 97-acre site on the banks of the Hudson in a village now known as Sleepy Hollow. The vision is unusual in that it already reflects significant public input, developed over three years by Phil Zegarelli, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow, and other local officials; Scenic Hudson, Historic Hudson Valley and citizens. Even before G.M. and the developer, the Roseland Property Company, have submitted their permit applications, more than 40 public meetings have been held. Participants have called for the project to be linked with the existing village network and the main commercial street, and for the project to restore public access to the Hudson River. The Mayor, G.M. and Roseland all deserve praise for listening to the public and reflecting community goals and values.
3/16/2003	Business; Auto Sales Are Down. Punish the Parts Makers.	IN early March, two of the world's biggest automakers Ford Motor and General Motors -- announced that they would cut production in the second quarter as they prepared for a downturn in car sales. G.M. said its cutback could be up to 10.5 percent; Ford released details of its cuts on Thursday, when it forecast reductions of 17 percent. Predictably, the automakers' stocks fell. But auto suppliers suffered with them.
3/15/2003	G.M. INCREASED RESERVES FOR BAD DEBT LAST YEAR	The finance unit of General Motors increased the money it set aside for bad debt by 42 percent last year after rebates on new models cut the value of used cars and caused higher loan losses, the company said. The finance unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, had $3.06 billion set aside for losses from bad loans at the end of 2002 compared with $2.17 billion the previous year, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company wrote off $1.17 billion in loans last year, up from $938 million in 2001, the filing said.
3/14/2003	Atmosphere of Gloom Thickens Around G.M. and Ford	A century ago, American car companies were nearly as plentiful as 1990's Internet start-ups. Now there are just two independents left, General Motors and Ford Motor, and some prominent analysts rate their prospects as not much better than a dot-com's. Without ''a material change'' in the industry's business model, G.M. and Ford face a crisis that ''will involve restructuring, consolidation, or possibly even mergers with other partners,'' said John Casesa, auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, in an interview.
3/13/2003	Reorganized Agency To Do Work for G.M.	The Publicis Groupe in Paris has disclosed details of the reorganization centered on its important General Motors Corporation account. Publicis is opening an agency in Troy, Mich., named Chemistri that will be dedicated to working for the Cadillac, Pontiac and the service and parts units of General Motors. Those duties had been handled by the Troy office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, the agency that Publicis is dissolving after acquiring the D'Arcy parent, the Bcom3 Group.
3/6/2003	California Offers Change In Car Rules	California is seeking to compromise with automakers by dropping a requirement that they sell electric cars, the state's latest attempt to persuade carmakers to end their opposition to the program. The California Air Resources Board outlined proposed changes to the zero-emission vehicle program today that would let companies sell more gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell autos instead of battery-powered cars starting with 2005 models, a spokesman, Dimitri Stanich, said.
3/6/2003	Businesses Begin to Consider The Cost for the Uninsured	With rising health costs squeezing profits, and growing numbers of people without insurance pushing costs even higher, employers are beginning to call for ways to deal with the problem of the uninsured. Employers have long viewed the uninsured as the responsibility of the government. But some executives and benefits specialists have come to realize that the 41 million Americans without insurance are costing them money as hospitals and doctors raise rates to cover the cost of such care.
3/6/2003	2 Companies Pay Penalties For Improving China Rockets	Two leading American aerospace companies have agreed to pay a record $32 million in penalties to settle civil charges that they unlawfully transferred rocket and satellite data to China in the 1990's. The agreement, which was completed on Tuesday and released today, comes two months after the State Department accused the companies, Hughes Electronics Corporation, a unit of General Motors, and Boeing Satellite Systems of 123 violations of export laws in connection with the Chinese data transfers. In a joint statement the companies said they ''express regret for not having obtained licenses that should have been obtained'' in the 1990's by a Hughes unit, the Hughes Space and Communications Company, which was acquired in 2000 by Boeing.
3/5/2003	Hydrogen Vans And Pumps Head For Washington	Drivers of some General Motors minivans will soon be pulling into a Shell station here to fill up on hydrogen, the two companies announced today. They said it would be the first hydrogen pump at an American service station and that hydrogen cars could be in showrooms by the end of the decade. But skeptics wonder if these supposed cars of the future will be powered mainly by an old-fashioned indigenous source of energy: politics. Critics say these experimental cars will be cruising Washington mainly to impress Congress so that the auto industry gets more subsidies and feels less pressure to improve the fuel efficiency of current cars.
3/2/2003	Leaving Tracks All Over The Dockets	WHEN is a Hummer not like a Jeep? When it is like a Studebaker, of course. All three have one thing in common: they've all been in litigation over their appearance. The first suit was a trademark infringement case brought by DaimlerChrysler against General Motors, which sells Hummers. A judge in Chicago ruled in January that the seven-bar grille of the Hummer H2 did not infringe on the design of Jeep's seven-bar grille.
3/1/2003	Community to Rise on Former G.M. Site	A 97-acre parcel of prime riverfront land vacant since an automotive factory closed seven years ago would be transformed into a waterfront promenade with a 150-room hotel, 1,562 housing units, a handful of small shops and tree-lined public walkways leading to the heart of Sleepy Hollow under development plans outlined this week. The project's developers, the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, N.J., presented their plans to village officials and residents at Sleepy Hollow High School tonight. The residential component of the plan includes 200 housing units for the elderly and 21 moderately priced town houses, and the developers expect the project to have 185,000 square feet of retail space and 95,000 square feet of office space. They would not give an estimate of the project's cost.
2/26/2003	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: G.M. To Invest In Technology Center	The No. 1 global carmaker General Motors will invest $60 million in a technology center in Bangalore, India's technology hub. G.M. said it would hire 260 engineers who will collaborate with the company's American and European research center through high-speed communication links. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2/20/2003	GENERAL MOTORS RESPONDS TO FUEL EFFICIENCY PROPOSAL	Improving the fuel efficiency of light trucks under a federal proposal would cost General Motors more than $1 billion and make its vehicles less safe, the automaker said in a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Under the administration's proposal, all light trucks, including sport utility vehicles and minivans, would have to increase their fuel economy level by 1.5 miles a gallon by 2007, a deadline G.M. says it will not be able to meet. A G.M. spokesman, Mike Morrissey, said the agency had overestimated what was feasible. To comply with the proposed rules, G.M. said it would have to reduce the vehicle's weight, which would increase the risk of rollover accidents. Ford Motor also filed a response to the proposal saying that the uniform standards were unfair and inefficient.
2/16/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Saturn Ion; Outer Limits Style From G.M.'s Sci-Fi Channel	LIKE Ponce de Leon hoping to splash in the Fountain of Youth, automakers seeking young customers are venturing into strange territory. Honda has crammed its hopes into a box called the Element. Toyota is turning to small cars with big speakers, called Scions. General Motors has taken the sci-fi route with its Saturn Ion, a plastic-sided capsule that could have been a prop in ''Plan 9 From Outer Space.'' Will Generation Y be wowed by ''personalized'' roof trim and Cyclops gauges atop the dashboard? Chris Wisniewski, 22, of Brooklyn, who keeps his finger on the fashion pulse in his product development job at the Gap, examined the Ion and pronounced it ''not particularly memorable.''
2/14/2003	Advertisers decide it's time for 'reality' -- at least on television.	BLUE-CHIP advertisers are beginning to shed their disdain for the reality television genre, as the soaring popularity of these shows -- particularly among young consumers -- has persuaded many to embrace Robin Williams's motto: ''reality . . . what a concept.'' Mainstream marketers like DaimlerChrysler, General Motors, Mars, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Pfizer and Visa have started buying significant commercial time on reality TV shows. Their largess will in turn only keep encouraging the networks to inundate viewers with yet more bachelors and bachelorettes, survivors, would-be American idols, B-list celebrities and ersatz millionaires.
2/13/2003	G.M. PLANS TO SELL 150,000 CARS FROM KOREAN VENTURE	General Motors said yesterday that it planned North American sales next year of as many as 150,000 cars from its venture in South Korea. The cars, built by the GM Daewoo Auto and Technology Company, will be sold primarily under the Chevrolet name, said John Smith, the G.M. group vice president for sales and marketing. General Motors introduced one GM Daewoo model, the 2004 Chevrolet Aveo small car, at the Chicago Auto Show yesterday. The Aveo has a starting price of about $10,000.
2/10/2003	A Bid by SBC For DirecTV Would Confirm Cable's Reach	The cable industry calls it the triple play. To Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the chairman of SBC Communications, the cable industry's ability to offer telephone, high-speed Internet and television services might as well be called the triple threat. With SBC's core local phone business in decline and the triple threat increasingly becoming a real threat, Mr. Whitacre has good reason to consider making a bid to take over the DirecTV satellite television operation of General Motors.
2/7/2003	Steel Supplier Is Threatening To Terminate G.M. Shipments	The largest steel supplier to General Motors is threatening to cut off shipments because of a dispute over contract terms that has turned into a legal battle. For G.M., the world's largest automaker, the halt of steel shipments from AK Steel, based in Middletown, Ohio, could lead to layoffs at 15 factories and tens of millions of dollars in losses a day.
2/4/2003	January Auto Sales Fall 2% As Analysts See Tough Year	Auto sales dropped 2 percent in January from a year earlier, carmakers reported today, signaling what many analysts say will be a tough year for the industry. Consumers are expected to benefit, though, from a wave of new products, particularly from foreign automakers like Nissan Motor, and cheaper prices because of the competition. Ford sales were up 4 percent, while G.M. sales fell 2 percent and Chrysler sales fell 12 percent. Sales were also down sharply from December as Detroit and particularly General Motors stepped back from lavish end-of-the-year incentives.
2/4/2003	Leased-Car Crash Liability Under Review in 3 States	Car companies, auto dealers and banks are putting pressure on New York State legislators to amend a 1929 law that if unchanged could make it difficult for New Yorkers to lease cars. The law allows plaintiffs in car accidents to sue leasing companies for damages, under a legal principle called vicarious liability, because the companies technically own the cars.
1/28/2003	Hybrid Autos Quick to Pass Curiosity Stage	Hybrids, vehicles that save gasoline by combining electric motors with internal combustion engines, are emerging as the first alternative-powered cars to show signs of catching on with automakers and some consumers since the automobile's early days. Toyota and Honda are already selling tens of thousands of hybrids, and General Motors and Ford, worried about ceding another fast-moving market to the Japanese, have announced plans to join them. The hybrid's rise has been encouraged by pressure from environmentalists and regulators, particularly California rules curbing greenhouse gases and smog-forming pollutants.
1/25/2003	Head of Inquiry On Olympic Ethics Has Link to Ward	Kenneth W. Duberstein, the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee's ethics panel, which exonerated the organization's chief executive, Lloyd Ward, of conflict of interest charges, has been paid $516,000 since 1999 as a lobbyist for General Motors, on whose board Ward serves. Two independent ethics experts said yesterday that Duberstein's work lobbying the United States Senate for General Motors presented a clear conflict of interest in his role as chairman of the Olympic committee's ethics panel. They said Duberstein's independence in the ethics panel's determinations on Ward could readily be seen by people as compromised by his business interest with General Motors and its board. Duberstein declined to comment yesterday.
1/24/2003	A Super Sunday for Football and for Madison Avenue	As Madison Avenue gears up for Super Bowl Sunday -- the biggest day of the year for both advertising and football -- marketers and agencies are adopting a strategy torn from a gridiron playbook: get big or go home. Many of the executives taking the expensive risk of advertising during the ABC broadcast of Super Bowl XXXVII on Sunday are deciding, in effect, if they've got it, they may as well flaunt it.
1/19/2003	One-Vehicle Gridlock: Hummer Arrives In the City	There are certain disadvantages to being an urban Hummer dealer. Take ''Hummer Happenings.'' These, as Hummer of Manhattan's sales manager, John Bruno Jr., explains, are off-road rallies organized by dealers for customers. He hopes to play host to his first event this spring.
1/19/2003	Ballet Slippers for a Big S.U.V. Bruiser	TESTED -- 2003 Yukon XL 2500 SLT WHAT IS IT? -- Large sport utility HOW MUCH? -- $41,262 base, $55,447 as tested, including SLT luxury trim ($5,501) Quadrasteer four-wheel steering ($4,495), rear-seat entertainment system ($1,295), self-leveling Autoride suspension ($1,295), second-row captain chairs ($490), heavy-duty 12,000-pound towing equipment ($290).
1/19/2003	G.M. Primps for Its Return to the Midsize Ball	EAGER to rekindle some of the passenger-car magic it lost long ago, General Motors is conjuring up new automobiles to assault the midsize market it once dominated. The Chevrolet Malibu, a sideshow in recent years, is moving to G.M.'s center ring. Executives fervently hope that an all-new 2004 model will resonate with buyers the way its namesake did in the 1960's and 70's.
1/17/2003	Corrections	A front-page article on Monday about large shortfalls in corporate pension plans misstated the amount that General Motors contributed to its United States plans in 2002. It was $4.8 billion; $2.6 billion was the amount in the fourth quarter.
1/17/2003	G.M.'s Profits Almost Tripled Last Year	General Motors reported today that it nearly tripled its profits last year and beat Wall Street's expectations in the fourth quarter, bringing employee bonuses back to the company, the world's largest automaker. G.M. was helped by its automotive operations in North America, with cost-cutting and strong sales offsetting the effects of a prolonged price war. ''Our strategy to leverage G.M.'s size and fundamentally improve its operating efficiency continues to pay off,'' John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman, said.
1/16/2003	G.M. Critical Of Regulator Questioning S.U.V. Safety	General Motors sharply criticized the Bush administration's top automobile regulator today for questioning the safety of some sport utility vehicles, signaling a surprising rift between the auto industry and the administration. Dr. Jeffrey Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, known as N.H.T.S.A., reiterated in a speech on Tuesday that the propensity of S.U.V.'s to roll over and the dangers they pose to passenger cars are among his top priorities. Dr. Runge, a former emergency room physician, spoke in sometimes pointed language about his concerns.
1/15/2003	Technology Briefing | Hardware: G.M. To Offer Satellite Radio On Most Models	General Motors, trying to increase market share by attracting consumers with new technology, said yesterday that it would offer satellite radio on 75 percent of its United States models starting with the 2004 model year. XM Satellite Radio Holdings, which has asked bondholders to let it delay interest payments, will provide the service in 44 of the automaker's 57 models, up from 25 models this year. The basic service costs $9.99 a month, excluding the price of the radio. G.M. first offered the XM service in Cadillac sedans, starting with the 2002 model year.
1/13/2003	MANY COMPANIES FIGHT SHORTFALLS IN PENSION FUNDS	After a three-year bear market, many major American companies are spending large amounts to shore up pension plans that have deteriorated, sometimes drastically. Many companies are also considering ways to reduce their pension obligations to workers, possibly undermining benefits for millions.
1/12/2003	Big Dreams Cause Big Eyes: From Concept to Production	CONCEPT cars are the dream machines of auto shows, unattainable flashes of show-biz glamour among vehicles that come with easy-payment plans, extended warranties and Scotchgard fabric protection. Concept cars are not for sale, and they may say more about the state of mind of the industry than about the state of the art of engineering. At this year's Detroit show, which opened yesterday after a week of previews and media events, gee-whiz future technologies are less in evidence than powerful but wistful visions of big American cars, like prewar limousines and the full-size sedan that until recently was almost written off as extinct.
1/10/2003	G.M. Warns of $2 Billion in Added Expenses From Pensions	General Motors said today that expenses related to its pension plan would triple from $1 billion to nearly $3 billion this year. As a result, the company said, its operating earnings would fall about 25 percent from last year, to $5 a share. ''We know we have to feed this and feed it cash over time, and that's exactly what we'll do,'' said John Devine, G.M.'s chief financial officer, in a conference call. ''We do have a substantial pension drag on both earnings and cash flow. This will improve over time. We will eventually get through this.''
1/9/2003	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Bush's Plan Taxes Certain Dividends, Fine Print Reveals	Not all corporate profits are created equal under President Bush's tax plan. Neither are all dividends. Details of the president's plan show that dividends will continue to be taxed when paid by companies that do not pay federal income taxes themselves. Companies with losses or those that use various techniques that eliminate taxable income will find they have no tax-free dividends to hand out.
1/9/2003	G.M. Expecting Lower Investment Gain	The General Motors Corporation, whose $76 billion pension obligation is the highest in the United States, said today that it would lower the return it expects from assets invested on behalf of retirees after three years of stock market declines. General Motors will reduce the 10 percent rate of return previously assumed for its United States pension fund, a spokeswoman, Toni Simonetti, said.
1/8/2003	Saturn campaign tries using alternate worlds to change its image.	REMEMBER the movie and song ''Town Without Pity''? An ambitious campaign to promote the struggling Saturn division of General Motors as a more youthful brand could well be called ''Town Without Parents.'' The fanciful towns shown in the campaign, which starts with television commercials that are scheduled to begin a three-month run tomorrow, represent stages in life from childhood and high school to college and marriage.
1/7/2003	At Auto Show, All-Frills Cars Are Out in Force	Times are lean and the economy shaky, but the auto industry is growing increasingly intent on coming up with offerings for the ultrarich. The latest among a bumper crop of new models aimed at the chauffeured class is a 1,000-horsepower prototype from the Cadillac division of General Motors, the Sixteen. It was shown Sunday night at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. As presented, the car looks like a cross between the Batmobile and a Rolls-Royce, and G.M. said it would be the first 16-cylinder engine produced since the 1940's.
1/4/2003	G.M. Lifts Market Share On Sales Burst In December	General Motors, intent on increasing its market share for the second consecutive year, turned to a fire sale last month that lifted sales 36 percent and helped it accomplish its goal, according to figures released today. The back-to-back annual gain in market share was the first since 1976, but it was made possible by zero percent financing deals and reliance on less profitable sales to corporate and rental fleets. Now Wall Street and Detroit are wondering whether several years of outsize vehicle sales, propped up by increasingly large incentives from the Big Three, will make a feast or famine of 2003. Added to that is the uncertain economy and the potential for war in Iraq.
12/27/2002	Push-Button Starting	When it's bitter cold outside, wouldn't it be nice to be able to start your car and warm it up from inside your house? Chevrolet, betting that buyers will appreciate this idea, is making a remote-start feature standard on its 2003 Malibu. It will be the industry's first factory-installed remote-start system. (A consumer can now buy a remote starter from an auto parts store for about $70 and have it installed, but it won't be covered under the car's warranty or tied into its antitheft system.)
12/24/2002	Moody's Cuts Its Ratings On Fiat Debt To Junk Level	Moody's Investors Service cut its ratings today on roughly $15 billion of Fiat debt to ''junk'' status, despite Fiat's recent sales of assets worth more than $1.6 billion. The credit downgrade comes at a time when Fiat has begun a broad overhaul to stanch losses at its struggling auto unit and to reduce its mountain of debt. Moody's said that its move was in response to Fiat's operating performance, particularly at the battered automobile division, its high debt levels, and the likelihood that Fiat, even after shedding its car business, would still not merit an investor grade rating.
12/24/2002	G.M. to Offer Hybrid Power In 5 Models By 2007	General Motors, which has been the most reticent major carmaker when it came to the prospects for hybrid vehicles, intends to offer some form of hybrid electric power on five of its major models over the next four production years, according to people briefed on the plan. G.M.'s plan, which will be announced next month at the North American International Auto Show here, is a surprising endorsement of the fledgling hybrid technology, which improves gasoline mileage by supplementing the internal combustion engine with electric power. G.M., the largest automaker, will offer several versions of the hybrid technology. The most advanced will be on the Saturn Vue sport utility vehicle, while less advanced versions will be available on the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks, a coming Chevrolet pickup called the Equinox and the Chevrolet Malibu.
12/20/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Auto Venture	General Motors and its main Chinese joint venture partner signed a $108 million agreement to take control of an auto production factory in Yantai, in northeastern China. The plant will become G.M.'s fourth production plant in China. G.M. has had rapid sales growth at its main China plant in Shanghai, where it makes an executive sedan and a minivan, and has added capacity to produce family cars and other vehicles at separate facilities around the country.

12/19/2002	Shifting Gears, With the Help of Software	THE ease of driving a car equipped with an automatic transmission makes automatics the overwhelming favorite of American motorists. But while the Hydra-Matic 4T40-E transmissions moving down the final assembly line at a General Motors factory in Windsor, Ontario, may be simple to use, they are far from simple to design and build. Flipped upward like cast-aluminum cornucopias, the partly assembled transmission bodies are fed a harvest of gears, chains, springs, electronics and wires. Exactly how the pieces come together to shift gears is something of a mystery even to the people who make the transmissions, which are soon to be installed in Chevrolet Cavaliers, Oldsmobile Aleros and other cars. When asked about the specifics of the torque converter, the link between the transmission and the engine, the plant's engineering manager, Don Wright, laughed. ''As for how it works, you'll have to ask someone else,'' he said. ''I'm the guy who knows how to make them.'' But what sets the 4T40-E apart from older models is not the intricacy of its mechanical and hydraulic systems. Rather it is a box tethered to the transmission by a wire. Inside, a sophisticated microprocessor uses special software to replace the electromechanical systems that once controlled automatic transmissions.
12/16/2002	Economy & Business; Big 3 Automakers Are Likely to Swerve Into the Slow Lane	HEADING into this year, a question hung over the Motor City: Could the boom-time sales pace of recent years, fueled by the mighty growth of sport utilities, possibly continue? The answer for much of 2002 was a resounding yes. So now analysts are asking the same question about 2003. And this time even auto executives are bracing for a slump.
12/15/2002	Car Black Box, The	Everyone knows about electronic flight-data recorders, also known as black boxes. But few people are aware that automakers are installing similar devices in millions of new cars -- devices that keep a detailed record of what happens while you're on the road. At its convention this past May, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America felt compelled to whip together a tutorial called The Black Box: It's Not Just in Airplanes Anymore. What did those lawyers learn? General Motors now equips many of its cars with what are called Event Data Recorders, small boxes that fit under the passenger seat and record data like speed, seat-belt use and whether the brakes were depressed in the final five seconds before a crash. (Other car companies are using similar technologies.) The information that's retrieved has been a bonanza for police departments, insurance agencies and -- yes -- trial lawyers, but these devices are also raising thorny privacy issues. Can Big Brother use these boxes to keep tabs on our whereabouts? And who really owns the information in the black box that's in your car, anyway?
12/15/2002	Where 6-Foot-4 Is Short	SPORTS was my obsession when I was growing up in Richmond, Va. Nothing was organized as it is today; kids just got together and played. When I was in the ninth grade, a couple of varsity football players got hurt, so I was called up from junior varsity. I weighed 150 pounds, so it was not pretty. I played end, and I sure don't remember scoring any touchdowns. My basketball coach told me to concentrate on basketball.
12/11/2002	Market Place; G.M. drops efforts to sell Hughes to EchoStar, maybe opening the way for a bid by News Corp.	GENERAL MOTORS ended its efforts to sell its Hughes Electronics division to the EchoStar Communications Corporation yesterday, two months after federal and state regulators moved to block the deal. Yesterday's move, which was widely expected, opens the door for Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to revive its long-frustrated efforts to enter the satellite television business in the United States.
12/6/2002	G.M. EXPANDS TERMS OF INTEREST-FREE LOANS TO FIVE YEARS	General Motors, the world's largest automaker, is lengthening the terms of interest-free loans on most 2003 sport-utility vehicles and will provide cash incentives on some models. The company is offering five-year no-interest financing on sport utilities like the midsize GMC Envoy and the full-size Chevrolet Suburban after three-year loans failed to raise demand. Sales for General Motors declined 18 percent in November and 32 percent in October even as the company offered zero interest financing with no down payment and no monthly payments for 90 days.
12/4/2002	Big Three's Auto Sales Fell Sharply in November	Sales at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company fell sharply in November from robust levels a year ago, and stocks of both companies were battered today. Many investors are concerned about the prospect of slumping industry sales next year, which even the automakers are expecting, coupled with increasing competition as foreign carmakers open more plants in the United States and continue to encroach on the lucrative pickup and sport utility market.
11/28/2002	EchoStar Plan To Get Hughes Is Revised	EchoStar Communications revised its plan today to buy Hughes Electronics for $26 billion in an effort to persuade regulators to reverse a decision blocking the proposed merger. EchoStar refused to make public its filing to the Federal Communications Commission. The agency had set today as the deadline for any changes to the planned purchase of Hughes, the owner of DirecTV, from General Motors.
11/26/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Isuzu Loss Triples	Losses at Isuzu Motors more than tripled in the six months to September from the previous year because of weak sales and one-time restructuring charges. Isuzu Motors, which is 48.5 percent owned by General Motors, lost 84 billion yen ($683 million) in the April-to-September period as sales fell 24 percent. The company expects to lose 181 billion yen in the full year, which ends in March 2003. Ken Belson (NYT)
11/24/2002	The Nation: The Price of Success; Now, Add God to the List of Enemies of the S.U.V.	IT'S not often you see a rabbi being chauffeured by a nun in a car emblazoned with the slogan ''What Would Jesus Drive?'' But such was the scene last week, when a coalition of Christian and Jewish religious leaders came here to press automakers for more fuel-efficient vehicles, and were ferried between General Motors and the Ford Motor Company by a convoy of nuns driving the Toyota Prius, a small car that combines gas and electric power. The slogan, which attracted much attention, was the work of Evangelical Environmental Network, a small grassroots group.
11/19/2002	A Group Links Fuel Economy To Religion	A broad coalition of religious groups is preparing a grass-roots campaign linking fuel efficiency to morality, with some ads going so far as to ask: ''What Would Jesus Drive?'' Leaders of the effort are coming to Detroit on Wednesday to meet with William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. They will also meet with executives at General Motors.
11/18/2002	The Corporations Behind the Curtain: Six Supporters of the Arts	Support of the arts has become an integral part of the philanthropy programs of corporations nationwide; for some company foundations, arts support constitutes more than 30 percent of their total giving. Here is a look at six notable companies that are regarded as important forces in the giving field, though there are dozens more that offer comparable programs. The figures supplied are for the companies' philanthropic foundations, unless otherwise noted. BEN SISARIO
11/17/2002	Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel	THREE decades ago, Dr. Craig Marks consigned his greatest feat of engineering to the scrap heap. Dr. Marks, who oversaw General Motors' futuristic engineering projects in the 1960's, had created a prototype that took more than two years and a staff of 250 to construct. It was called the Electrovan, the automotive industry's first attempt at making an automobile powered by a hydrogen fuel cell -- a technology now embraced as the power train of the future.
11/15/2002	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: XM Satellite Seeks Deferral Of Debt Payment	XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the first United States satellite radio broadcaster, said yesterday that it was in talks with General Motors to defer as much as $200 million in debt payments. XM shares fell as much as 34 percent. XM is trying to delay payments to General Motors that are owed under an agreement for G.M. to market XM's digital radio service. To renegotiate the debt, XM must raise at least $200 million in additional financing, the company said in a statement. XM and its investment bankers are in talks with investors about the new financing. XM is trying to defer the payments after its cash and cash equivalents dwindled to $31.7 million in the third quarter from $182.5 million a year earlier. XM said it would cut costs to try to make its current cash last through the first quarter of 2003. General Motors owns 22 percent of XM and offers XM's service in more than half of its model-year 2003 vehicles. The two companies are negotiating a deferral of payments in exchange for General Motors' receiving debt and convertible securities in XM, a General Motors spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, said. XM shares fell 73 cents, or 24 percent, to $2.32.
11/8/2002	An S.U.V.? Oh, That's So Over!	THE hills around the Vernon Valley in northern New Jersey have curving stretches of graded, tree-lined back roads, and almost no traffic. It was here that Mitch Joseph led a group of other car owners on a Sunday afternoon drive. Mr. Joseph, 38, an electrician from Elizabeth, N.J., likes to explore, looking for hidden roads with what he calls rhythm, and a couple of times a month he shares his discoveries. As the group headed out in a small parade, Mr. Joseph's shimmering gray car led two others built just like it, vehicles anyone who lived through the 1970's would instantly recognize as station wagons. But that's not what their owners call them.
11/8/2002	Outfitting The Tank	Despite its lofty $48,000 price, General Motors' new Hummer H2 sport utility vehicle is selling as fast as its dealers can get it, and buyers are adding an average of $1,500 worth of accessories each, according to G.M. Some of these extras are practical. Others seem to connect with Americans' inner G.I. Joe: the H2, after all, is an offshoot of the military Humvee transport and its eccentric civilian version, the Hummer H1. So to keep up with the Schwarzkopfs, how does the H2 owner choose accessories?
11/7/2002	A Korean City Welcomes G.M.'s Return	For Han Ik Soo, who oversees production of 400 compact cars a day in an antiquated plant in this industrial port city west of Seoul, the recent takeover of the factory by General Motors represents a welcome reunion. ''General Motors was running the plant when I first went to work here 26 years ago,'' Mr. Han said, showing visitors around the sprawling compound in the city's Bupyung district. ''They built most of the plant. We are glad to see them back.''
11/5/2002	Webster's Public Service Image Not Duplicated in Private Sector	As a public servant, William H. Webster has an impeccable rsum. Mr. Webster, who last week became the head of a new government board that will oversee the accounting industry, is the only person to have served as the director of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. He has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a special medal from the American Bar Association for outstanding leadership.
11/4/2002	Chubb Chooses G.M. Official As Its New Chief Executive	The Chubb Corporation, a leading commercial insurer, yesterday named a longtime General Motors executive with little insurance experience, John D. Finnegan, as its new chief executive. Mr. Finnegan, 53, will succeed Dean R. O'Hare, who has been running Chubb for 14 years, in December. Mr. O'Hare, one of the most outspoken insurance executives, has been at Chubb for 39 years.
11/1/2002	Big Three Carmakers Expect Sharp Drop in Monthly Sales	Carmakers are expecting a sharp falloff when they report October sales on Friday, and some analysts fear that a second consecutive month of slumping results could indicate an end to boom times for auto sales. Many analysts have been cutting back their expectations for October throughout the month, and J. D. Power & Associates is forecasting sales at the lowest monthly rate in four years.
10/29/2002	An Uneasy Wait in Oklahoma	Workers at the General Motors plant here wore red-white-and-blue ribbons today for their colleague Sandy Alan Booker, who was feared dead in the siege that ended the occupation of a Moscow theater by Chechen rebels. Mr. Booker, 49, an electrician at the plant, went to Russia to correct some irregularities in paperwork that had delayed his Russian fiance's arrival in the United States, said two of his co-workers, Jerry Kincannon and Mike Byrd.

10/26/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Isuzu To Post Loss	The car and truck maker Isuzu Motors expects to lose money for the fourth consecutive year in fiscal year 2002 as it offsets the costs of closing some of its operations in the United States. The automaker, which is 49 percent owned by General Motors, said it would lose 170 billion yen ($1.4 billion) in the full year to March 2003. Isuzu's five main banks also agreed take equity in exchange for writing off 100 billion yen ($800 million) of the automaker's debts. Ken Belson (NYT)
10/25/2002	Corrections	The Advertising column in Business Day yesterday, about the sponsorship of a concert and prayer tour by the Chevrolet division of General Motors, misstated the name of a performer taking part. He is Michael W. Smith, not W. Michael Smith.
10/25/2002	Carmaker's Complaint	To the Editor: Re ''Incentives Still Leave G.M. Short of Market Goal'' (Business Day, Oct. 22): The Japanese and Korean automobile companies make reliable, fuel-efficient cars. I suppose that from General Motors' perspective, that constitutes unfair competition. DAVID BLAIR Princeton, N.J., Oct. 22, 2002
10/24/2002	U.S. Carmakers Losing Ground To Imports Despite Deals	The billions of dollars that General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have spent during the last year on the most generous sales incentives in automotive history have not bought them what they wanted: a bigger share of the market. The latest offers -- for everything from Chevrolet Cavaliers to Cadillac Escalades and Ford Focuses to Jaguar S-Types -- include zero percent loans, with no money down and no monthly payments until 2003, or else thousands of dollars in cash rebates. The deals are available not only on leftover 2002 models, but also on the newest cars and trucks.
10/24/2002	G.M. Gets Criticism for Backing Tour of Christian Music Performers	Leaders of two religious organizations are questioning Chevrolet's sponsorship of a concert and prayer tour aimed at evangelical Christians, complaining that big consumer marketers should not identify themselves so closely with one faith. But Chevrolet said yesterday that it would stand by its decision.
10/23/2002	With Pedal to the Metal And Stogie in His Pocket, Bob Lutz Is Back at G.M.	A FEW rules to keep in mind when interviewing Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of General Motors. Do not conduct the interview in an Australian muscle car. If you do, do not let him drive. If he is driving, bring a tape recorder, because handwritten notes will resemble seismograph readings, like 7 on the Richter scale. Most important: eat light, keep your eyes focused on the horizon and make sure your will is in order.
10/23/2002	Finding a Reincarnated American Classic on a Trip to Australia	MOST visitors to Australia go home with a stuffed koala, a bottle of wine and maybe a deep winter tan from Bondi Beach. When the General Motors Corporation's vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, made a three-and-a-half-day visit in February, he returned with a new 300-horsepower-plus sports coupe that will be the base for a reincarnated classic, the GTO, which Mr. Lutz hopes will reinvigorate the Pontiac brand.
10/22/2002	Incentives Still Leave G.M. Short of Market Goal	Despite a relentless campaign of incentives like interest-free loans with no money down, General Motors officials expressed doubts today about achieving their goal of capturing 29 percent of the United States market for new cars this year. They blamed Korean and Japanese auto companies, saying they have gained an unfair advantage through devalued currencies and marketing actions. In recent months, G.M. executives have been wearing pins with the numeral ''29'' as a reminder of the market share target, which G.M. last achieved in 1999. The company has repeatedly emphasized the popularity of its lineup of sport utility vehicles, and insisted that it has gained market momentum.
10/20/2002	Look Again: Aztek Visits Beauty Shop	GRETA VAN SUSTERAN got one. Jocelyne Wildenstein had several. And last year, the Pontiac Aztek received a face lift at the tender age of 1. The post-op Aztek looks cleaner, though it is unlikely to show up in any S.U.V. swimsuit competitions. The front and rear ends were stripped of extraneous details, three horizontal ''speed lines'' were removed from behind the front wheel wells and dark plastic lower-body cladding was replaced by panels that match the paint color, more or less. G.M. ordered the quick restyling -- the automotive equivalent of a 10-minute makeover on ''The Jenny Jones Show'' -- after the sci-fi-styled 2001 Aztek made its debut before an incredulous public. But the changes may have come too late to save the Aztek from its stigma.
10/18/2002	Bulgari Touch In Cadillacs	A car for the status-conscious deserves a high-status dashboard, and Cadillac has commissioned Bulgari, the Italian maker of jewelry and watches, to design the gauges and clocks in some of its new models. A Bulgari-designed clock is in the 2003 Escalade and Escalade EXT sport utility vehicles and in the Escalade ESV, an S.U.V. due out in December. The Bulgari name is on the face of the clock and on the brushed metal circle around it.
10/17/2002	G.M. Completes Financing For Auto Venture in Korea	General Motors lined up the final piece of financial support today for its plan to transform most of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor into a viable new competitor in the rapidly growing East Asian vehicle market. The new company, to be called GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology, will formally open its doors on Thursday, bolstered by $2 billion in new loans announced today from the state-owned Korea Development Bank and three commercial banks.
10/17/2002	For Ford and G.M., the Problems Ahead Have Different Sources	While the stocks of General Motors and Ford Motor are falling almost in tandem, the risks seen in the two American automakers are divergent. For Ford, there is worry about its auto business; for G.M., there is worry about much besides its auto business. Today, Ford reported a $326 million loss for the third quarter and the long-term ratings of both Ford and its financial subsidiary, Ford Credit, were put on a credit watch with negative implications by Standard & Poor's. The bond market has taken a dim view of Ford's prospects and the action by the S.& P., a crucial rating agency, only served to drive the company's borrowing costs up further. Wall Street is concerned about the progress that Ford executives are making in cutting costs from bloated manufacturing operations while also bolstering a product lineup that has been losing market share.
10/16/2002	G.M. Offers Investors a Bag of Mixed Messages	For a company that is selling sport utility vehicles and pickups at a blistering pace and making progress in cutting costs that were out of control a few years ago, General Motors offered investors an oddly mixed outlook today. First, the good news. Despite reporting a much wider third-quarter net loss, the profit of the company's North American operations grew 15 percent. And its operating earnings, excluding a huge write-down related to its investment in the Italian conglomerate Fiat's auto business, handily beat analysts' expectations.
10/14/2002	Auto Venture in Korea	The General Motors consortium that is taking over the three key Korean plants of bankrupt Daewoo Motors acquired a strategic partner in China today in the form of the state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation.
10/13/2002	Private Sector; A Bit of Snapping and Snarling For Two of Detroit's Top Dogs	Detroit loves a good brawl between automakers, and it looks as if one is brewing between Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, and Robert Lutz, the General Motors vice chairman. The tetchiness began a couple of weeks ago, when Mr. Lutz was quoted by a German newspaper as questioning why Chrysler was promoting a seven-year, 70,000-mile warranty on its vehicles. ''With quality as it is at Chrysler today, I wonder why they did that,'' Mr. Lutz was quoted as saying.
10/13/2002	Corrections	An article last Sunday about plans for the site of a former General Motors plant in Sleepy Hollow misstated the make of the vehicles last manufactured there. It was Chevrolet. (Chrysler is a competing company.)
10/13/2002	Fuel Gauge Is Near 'E' For the Big Three	SINCE 9/11, major auto companies have relied heavily on zero percent financing to bolster sales. Worried that such methods have hurt profit margins, however, investors have bid down prices of auto company stocks and bonds. Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, has been bearish on the group since the summer. Last week, he discussed his reasons. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
10/12/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Weighs Options With G.M.	The ailing Italian automobile giant Fiat played down reports that it was planning to sell the remainder of its auto division to its partner General Motors, while factory workers across the country went on strike against Fiat's proposal to cut 20 percent of its 36,000 work force in Italy. A Fiat spokesman, Raffaelo Porro, said that comments made yesterday by Fiat's chairman, Paolo Fresco, above, indicating the high likelihood of the sale reflected only one extreme option. ''Many options are being studied,'' Mr. Porro said. Jason Horowitz (NYT)
10/11/2002	A Merger Unlikely, What's Next for EchoStar?	So what is Charles W. Ergen's Plan B? If Mr. Ergen, the chairman of EchoStar Communications, is unable to persuade the Federal Communications Commission to reverse its rejection of his company's proposed acquisition of Hughes Electronics, he readily acknowledges that he has no backup plan. ''I haven't given that thought,'' Mr. Ergen said on Wednesday at an industry conference in Midtown Manhattan. For a moment he allowed himself to think about it, acknowledging that if the deal failed, his company would ''go over a cliff.'' Then he resumed his pep talk: ''I'm playing to win. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about losing.''
10/11/2002	F.C.C. Blocks EchoStar Deal With DirecTV	The Federal Communications Commission blocked the merger of the nation's two largest satellite television broadcasters today, the first time in 36 years that the agency has challenged a large corporate deal for being anticompetitive and against the public interest. Executives at the satellite companies, EchoStar Communications and the DirecTV unit of General Motors' Hughes Electronics, said they remained committed to a deal and would soon propose substantial revisions to satisfy the regulators. But in a sign of the regulatory skepticism about even a revised deal, the F.C.C. issued its 4-to-0 ruling after refusing the last-ditch entreaties of the companies to delay the vote until the new proposal was formally made.
10/10/2002	White House Joins Fight Against Electric Cars	The Bush administration went to court today to support the automobile industry's effort to eliminate requirements in California that auto manufacturers sell electric cars. President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., was the chief lobbyist for General Motors, one of the plaintiffs in the case. Mr. Card was also head of an auto industry trade association when California proposed to require electric vehicles, and has publicly opposed such a requirement.
10/10/2002	Buick uses a mid-20th-century designer to lure younger buyers, but also brings out the skeptics.	TO try to revive its image among younger car buyers, Buick is taking the unusual step of resurrecting an old hero. Buick, a division of General Motors, is rolling out an advertising campaign built around Harley Earl, the Hollywood-trained style wizard who oversaw the creation of G.M.'s grandest designs. The problem is, Mr. Earl died in 1969. Skeptics are wondering out loud if Buick -- whose average car buyer is now about 65 -- can effectively reach its target audience of younger people with a spokesman who died before many of them were born and who is best known for design innovations introduced half a century ago.
10/10/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Partner For GM Daewoo	Another Asian partner has agreed to join General Motors in the consortium that it has formed to assume a controlling stake in GM Daewoo Auto and Technology. China's state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, a joint venture partner with General Motors, has agreed to pay $59.7 million for 10 percent of the newly formed company, which is taking over three major plants in Korea from the bankrupt Daewoo Motors. Don Kirk (NYT)
10/9/2002	G.M. SAYS COST-CUTTING IS INCREASING PROFIT MARGINS	The General Motors Corporation is increasing profit margins this year through cost-cutting and sales of more expensive models, its chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said yesterday. The company is benefiting from rebates and no-interest loans that draw affluent customers to new models like the Hummer H2 and Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicles, with prices that start at $48,000, he said.
10/6/2002	A Hurdle Cleared on Riverfront Site	THE village of Sleepy Hollow and the General Motors Corporation officially ended the latest volley in their continuing David-and-Goliath legal struggle over control and development of the former automobile plant site, a 97-acre riverfront property that was closed in 1996 and has since been razed. The battle has been particularly heated because of the reverberations, both temporary and long term, for local school districts, Metro-North Railroad and the public riverfront. The new accord requires General Motors to pay the village $2 million in lieu of taxes over the next three years, in addition to the current annual payment of $150,000. After a three-year permissions and approvals period the developer chosen by General Motors, Roseland Property Company based in Short Hills, N.J., will begin to pay tax on the newly reassessed property. If the developer does not meet the required deadlines, the village will have the option to buy the site.
10/6/2002	A Stocking Stuffer For a Big Stocking	Neiman Marcus is preparing to take orders for a limited-edition version of the 2004 Cadillac XLR sports car, selected as the featured car in Neiman's holiday catalog this year. But buying one won't be as simple as shopping for cashmere socks. When customers start dialing in at 10 a.m., Eastern time, on Oct. 15 for one of the 99 cars -- all violet-hued convertibles -- they'll be given a place in line. But Neiman Marcus will not be taking their $85,000. The buyers instead will directed to nearby Cadillac dealers and will have about a week to march down with deposits of $7,500.
10/4/2002	Enough Gas? Eyes Right	Hop behind the wheel of Saturn's new Ion, and you immediately notice something out of place. The dashboard is blank where the speedometer and the fuel gauge should be. The Ion is the most recent car to feature an instrument panel with the speedometer and gauges moved to the center of the dashboard. Some cars were designed this way in the 1950's, but it's a rare feature now. Toyota's Echo and the Panoz Esperante, a limited-volume sports car, have similar arrangements.
10/3/2002	CHRYSLER EXPANDS INCENTIVES ON 2003 MODELS	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler is expanding the availability of some no-interest loans and lowering interest rates on other 2003 models as it adjusts its strategy of offering fewer sales incentives than General Motors and Ford Motor, its rivals in the United States. Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker, will offer five-year no-interest loans on minivans and 2.9 percent 60-month loans on all 2003 cars that had carried 4.9 percent financing, said a spokesman, Marc Henretta. Cash rebates rose as high as $2,500 from $1,500, he said.
10/2/2002	Slow September Sales Lead to New Auto Incentives	The robust pace of auto sales slowed in September, causing a fresh round of big incentives from Ford and General Motors and debate from Wall Street about the industry's outlook. Over all, industry sales rose 3.2 percent compared with September 2001, but fell sharply from the strong pace this year. Last month, sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.3 million vehicles, compared with 18.7 million in August and 18.1 million in July, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
9/30/2002	New Economy; EchoStar would seem to be a winner even if it doesn't gain control of DirecTV.	EVEN if EchoStar, the nation's No. 2 satellite-television company, fails in its attempt to acquire the market leader, DirecTV, Charles W. Ergen, EchoStar's chairman, will probably end up looking smart. Over the next few weeks, federal officials are scheduled to finish reviewing EchoStar's deal to acquire General Motors' Hughes Electronics division, which includes DirecTV. The deal is not dead, but its chances look slim.
9/29/2002	Smokestack Visionary	Last January, Larry Burns, General Motors' vice president for research and development and planning, unveiled the company's plans for the car of the future. It wasn't exactly a car but the underpinnings of one, sort of a 16-foot-long, two-dimensional wine carafe on wheels -- what Burns called the ''skateboard.'' The car would come in two parts, Burns explained. The car's power and control system would be encased in the skateboard, which could be kept for decades while customers shuffled car bodies as tastes changed. And the bodies, too, would be radically different from what we know, with the windshield extending all the way down to the floor because the car's essential systems are kept underfoot. The first working prototype, dubbed Hy-wire, made its debut at the Paris Motor Show last week. Hy-wire represents a merging of technologies: the hydrogen fuel cell, a power system that creates electrical current from chemical reactions and drive-by-wire, which replaces mechanical linkages between parts with electronic ones. Taken together, the technologies would move the automobile from the machine age to the digital age and result in a car that emits only water vapor.
9/29/2002	Encore! Rear-Drive Cars Take the Stage Again	THIRTY years ago, the wave of the future was front-wheel drive. Now that wave is heading the other way, as Detroit converts entire car lines back to rear-wheel drive, and other automakers make plans to sprinkle their lineups with new rear-drive models as well. The return to rear drive is a revolution for Chrysler and G.M., which responded to the oil shocks of the 1970's and 80's by shifting to front drive for most of their cars. Because one front-drive advantage is space efficiency -- most drivetrain components are under the hood, and there is no high driveline tunnel to rob interior room -- they were able to maximize space as they developed smaller, less thirsty cars.
9/29/2002	Classics Made New	For Wayne Cherry, the chief of design at General Motors, the station wagon created by the legendary Harley Earl was a seminal moment in car design. ''This was one of the dream cars of the 1950's Motoramas,'' Cherry says. ''It embodied optimism and excitement, and when you look at it today, it still strikes those emotional chords. ''We wanted to capture the excitement of the '55,'' says Cherry of the Nomad he conceived with Sung Paik, his fellow designer. ''In addition to the overall profile of the vehicle, you can see various cues that we picked up on.'' Among them are the wraparound rear window, the ribs on the rear door and the ''gesture'' of the roof. ''They made the original lower and sportier,'' Cherry explains, ''but by doing so they realized that an average man could now see the roof,'' so they had to create one that was aesthetically pleasing, an element Cherry nods to in his fantasy design.
9/27/2002	The Last Thing Russia Needs: The S.U.V.	To the Editor: Re ''G.M. Takes a Leap of Faith Into the Russian Car Market'' (Business Day, Sept. 21):
9/25/2002	National Briefing | Consumers: A Recall By General Motors	The General Motors Corporation is recalling about 597,000 of its 2000-2002 Chevrolet Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon and Denali sport utility vehicles because passengers are pinching their fingers in the seats. The models, built from September 1999 through February, have a mechanical head restraint designed to fold when second-row seats are moved from upright to stowed position, said a spokesman, Jim Schell. Fourteen people, including 10 children, inadvertently pinched fingers in a slot in the upholstery while the headrest was folded down, the company said.
9/24/2002	World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Strike Deadline At Ford	The Canadian Auto Workers union said that Ford Motor Company's local unit would be its next target for negotiations on a new labor contract with the Big Three North American automakers. The union, which agreed on a three-year contract with General Motors of Canada last week, said its 12,900 members at Ford would go on strike if no deal was reached by Oct. 1. The talks with Ford will center on the company's plan to close an F-150 pickup truck plant in Oakville, Ontario, next year with the loss of about 1,500 jobs. Bernard Simon (NYT)
9/22/2002	Private Sector; Saber-Rattler in Labor's Corner	BUZZ HARGROVE ridicules corporate adversaries in labor talks and keeps them guessing. He puts workers on strike standby right up until a contract's expiration. But his reputation for wringing maximum tension out of a negotiation suffered a slight setback last week. Mr. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, shook hands with General Motors executives shortly after 7 p.m. on Tuesday, having reached a three-year contract agreement about five hours before picket lines were to go up. In 1999, the last time Mr. Hargrove was in bargaining talks with a Big Three automaker -- he was negotiating with the Ford Motor Company -- a contract was reached three hours before a strike deadline.
9/22/2002	Sleepy Hollow and G.M. Agree on Development Deadline	The village of Sleepy Hollow has reached a new agreement with General Motors for the development of the company's 97-acre property along the Hudson River. The former automobile plant has been closed since June 1996, and was torn down in 1999. The recent settlement came after the village began legal proceedings against General Motors to buy the property, because construction had not begun in the agreed-upon five-year period.
9/21/2002	G.M. Takes a Leap of Faith Into the Russian Car Market	General Motors will cut the ribbon on Monday on a risky $340 million bet: that it can prosper in the Russian car market by building a new sport utility vehicle designed by its local partner, AvtoVAZ, Russia's largest and most controversial car company. The venture, which is meant to turn out 75,000 of the boxy Jeep-like vehicles a year by 2004, is the biggest foreign investment so far in Russia's struggling auto industry, and the second from Detroit. Ford Motor opened an assembly plant in St. Petersburg in July, opting to go it alone without a Russian partner.
9/20/2002	Gliding By On 4 Wheels	After repeatedly circling the block, you finally see a parking spot. But it's tight. You will have to back in and out several times to squeeze in. If only you could turn the wheels toward the sidewalk and order the car to glide into the space by itself. That's almost what four-wheel steering allows you to do. With both sets of wheels turning, rather than just the front ones, the car turns tightly, and it's easier to park. Sharp turns on the road are easier, too.
9/20/2002	G.M. TO RESUME NO-INTEREST LOANS ON 2002 MODELS	General Motors said yesterday that it would offer 60-month no-interest loans on remaining 2002 models, matching rivals' offers. The loans will cover all 2002 models and will run from Sept. 30, a spokeswoman said, adding that no-interest loans will continue on most 2003 models. The automaker had ended the loans on 2002 models this month after it said it had sold most of the vehicles. It said it had about 300,000 of its 2002 models in inventory at the end of August, less than the backlog of 450,000 a year earlier. Ford and Chrysler are offering no-interest loans on most 2002 and 2003 models.
9/18/2002	G.M. and Canadian Workers Reach Pact, Averting Strike	General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers union agreed tonight on a new three-year contract covering 19,000 workers in Canada, just five hours before a strike deadline set by the union. The agreement includes wage increases of 3 percent in each of the first two years and a 2 percent rise in the third, plus a signing bonus of 1,000 Canadian dollars ($632). It also offers 28 additional hours of paid vacation each year and other improved fringe benefits. In addition, G.M. has agreed to invest 800 million Canadian dollars ($506 million) in its Canadian plants, including a line to produce a new full-size truck model.
9/10/2002	Delphi Wins G.M. Orders	The Delphi Corporation has received contracts to make steering columns for cars and light trucks, including full-size pickup and sport utility vehicles from General Motors in the 2003 model year. The contracts are valued at $1.68 billion over five years. The orders will add more than $335 million in annual sales through 2007, a spokeswoman said.
9/10/2002	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Saturday about the financial outlook for the Big Three automakers paraphrased incorrectly from a comment by Scott Sprinzen, managing director for corporate and government bond ratings at Standard & Poor's. He said the Ford Motor Company and General Motors should be able to obtain financing for the foreseeable future from the market for asset-backed securities, not from the bond market.
9/6/2002	Canadian Union Picks G.M. for First Talks	The union representing 46,000 Canadian auto workers today chose General Motors as its target -- the company that it will negotiate a new labor contract with first, to set a pattern for contracts with the others. But the union indicated that its most serious issues were with Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, not G.M. Announcing the choice to cheering union officials at a Toronto hotel, Buzz Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, said job security remained the union's top concern even though car and truck sales are strong. ''Restructuring, job losses, layoffs and closures are still threats that we're having to face in our bargaining,'' Mr. Hargrove said. The union will also seek ''substantial'' wage increases, he said.
9/5/2002	No-Interest Financing and Rebates Sent Car Sales Up 13.5% in August	The nation's largest automakers reported today that they broke industry sales records in August, fueled by bountiful incentives and a willingness by otherwise wary consumers to spend money on new vehicles. More pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles were sold last month than in any single month in the industry's history. Light trucks, including minivans, made up 51.5 percent of industry sales in August.
9/1/2002	Daewoo Owners Ask, 'What Next?'	JOHN CLARK thought he was getting a great deal in May when he bought a fully equipped Daewoo Leganza, with CD player, leather seats and just 17,000 miles on the odometer, for his wife, Lori. Mr. Clark of Orlando, Fla., paid a Mazda dealer $9,700 for the 2001 Leganza, which had once carried a sticker price of around $18,000. Since Daewoo promised warranty protection for three years or 36,000 miles, Mr. Clark said he wasn't worried about the possibility that General Motors might buy much of Daewoo, the failing South Korean automaker. ''The salesman said G.M. was going to honor the warranty,'' said Mr. Clark, 47, who sells outdoor advertising. ''I just said, 'That's great.' ''
8/28/2002	Many Marketers Will Forgo Ads During Sept. 11	Two weeks before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a consensus seems to be emerging about advertising on that day: less will be more. Most marketers, agencies and media companies are deciding that they would rather go adless or limit their advertising than risk being perceived as exploiting the day for mercenary purposes.
8/27/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Suppliers Push Daewoo	Nearly 200 companies that supply components for Daewoo Motor said they would suspend deliveries beginning on Thursday unless the company began to pay them more than $300 million in accumulated debts. The parts suppliers, which have organized as the Association of Daewoo Motor Suppliers, warned that parts makers would go bankrupt unless the creditors who own the company guarantee that the parts companies would be paid. The impasse threatened a further delay in carrying out the agreement under which General Motors is to take over Daewoo Motor with an initial payment of $400 million. Don Kirk (NYT)
8/26/2002	Daewoo Faces Boycott Threat From Suppliers	Daewoo Motor is confronting a new threat to production this week just as it appears on the verge of a takeover by General Motors that could again turn it into a major competitor in Korea and much of Asia. This time the bankrupt company must contend with the threat of a boycott by suppliers demanding payment for parts shipped over the last two years.
8/25/2002	The Most Wanted F-Cars Today	SOME Camaros and Firebirds have become prized collectibles, particularly the limited-production, high-performance models of the muscle-car era of the 1960's and early 1970's. Skyrocketing prices have even fostered a cloning industry. Some experts say, tongues in cheek, that of the 602 Camaro Z28's that Chevrolet built in 1967, more than 2,000 are still in existence.
8/25/2002	A Last Ride on G.M.'s Wild Ponies	MAYBE fans of the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird would feel better if General Motors were ending production to free up their factory for a hot-selling car, or even a sport utility. Not so. Instead, the automaker will shut down its plant in Ste. Thrse, Quebec, after the last of the two-door, rear-drive cars rolls off the assembly line on Wednesday. There will be no 2003 models of the Camaro or Firebird, which have been the cornerstone of G.M.'s performance heritage for 35 years.
8/25/2002	Business; In Detroit, Steady Hands Are Steadying Nerves	PERPETUALLY known as a one-industry town, Detroit has always been a place where chief executives have been fawned over, gossiped about and followed as if they were movie stars or sports heroes. But lately, the spotlight has shifted one box lower on the organization chart. The city's two most prominent chief financial officers -- John M. Devine, 55, at General Motors, and Allan D. Gilmour, 68, at Ford Motor -- have become the men to watch. Both have been in their current jobs for relatively short periods, and both are well known to Wall Street analysts and credit ratings agencies because of their lengthy automotive careers. That familiarity is proving an asset, as executives at some other big American companies have been led away in handcuffs and as a jittery stock market has reacted violently to bad news.
8/25/2002	The F-Cars, From A to Z28	HERE are highlights in the development of General Motors' F-body pony cars: APRIL 17, 1964 -- Lee A. Iacocca, general manager of the Ford Division, introduces a small sporty car built largely with parts from the Falcon compact. ''Mustang fever'' grips the nation as a new automotive category, dubbed the pony car, is born. More than 400,000 Mustangs are sold within 12 months.
8/25/2002	Well Suited for Both Smokeys and Bandits	FIREBIRDS have their fans, and Camaros have their cheerleaders. Among the few things on which both sides agree is this: the Pontiacs got the movie roles and the Chevys got the bad guys. Pontiac's version of the General Motors F-car played leading roles in the ''Smokey and the Bandit'' movies and in television series like ''The Rockford Files'' and ''Knight Rider.''
8/25/2002	Private Sector; On the Generation-Gap Bridge, in a Caddy	Jack Smith, the chairman of General Motors, and the former Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant might not seem to have much in common. But last Thursday, they were on hand at G.M.'s Renaissance Center headquarters in Detroit to celebrate the 100th birthday of Cadillac, which has been featuring Led Zeppelin's classic song ''Rock and Roll'' in its television ads. It was easy to tell them apart. Mr. Smith, 64, was the one in the dark business suit. Mr. Plant, 54, was clad in a luminescent purple shirt open to his navel.
8/20/2002	Miscellany	* General Motors, Detroit, agreed to extend its five-year marketing partnership with the Women's National Basketball Association, New York. Terms of the new agreement and its length were not disclosed. The deal calls for G.M. to advertise during coverage of games on television as well as on WNBA.com.
8/16/2002	What Awaits A Dream Car When Dreams Change?	IN the small subset of automobiles that can properly be called American sports cars, the undisputed king is the Corvette. The original two-seater Thunderbird, which had a good run but wasn't made after 1957, was not really a sports car; today's successor isn't either. The Dodge Viper, a challenger since 1991, has not reached Corvette-level appeal or sales. The AC Cobra, now a beloved collectors' car, flashed in and flamed out in the 60's. The Corvette endures -- 32,000 made every year, 32,000 sold every year. Those who love the Corvette love it fanatically. To Martin A. Drutz, a Miami accountant who has owned a dozen Corvettes and has an office full of Corvette memorabilia, it is the sine qua non: ''To me, there is no other car.''
8/15/2002	G.M. Moves to Increase Control of Some Isuzu Units	General Motors said today that it planned to restructure its stake in Isuzu Motors by taking control of parts of the troubled Japanese automaker's diesel division and cutting its equity stake in the whole company to 12 percent from 49 percent now. The steps, which G.M. said would be complete by the end of the year, would help shore up the finances of the debt-laden Isuzu, one of the weakest of Japan's car and truck manufacturers. G.M. will give Isuzu 60 billion yen ($511 million) in cash to recapitalize its stake, and in exchange will get greater control of the most valuable part of Isuzu's operations, its diesel engine business.
8/14/2002	G.M. Version of Fuel-Cell Car	General Motors released today the first pictures of a prototype car called the Hy-wire, a fusion of technologies that re-imagines how cars look, operate and drive. Hy-wire is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, a technology that was used in the lunar lander and one that every automaker is trying to adapt for cars.
8/10/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo To Sell Bus Plant	Daewoo Motor plans to sell a bus plant that was not included in the acquisition by General Motors of Daewoo's Korean car-making units. A Korean company that makes sports hats has signed a preliminary agreement to buy Daewoo's bus factory in Pusan and a stake in its bus-making plant in China for $116 million. The Daewoo plant in Pusan, with a capacity of 8,000 buses a year, manufactured 7,564 buses in 2001. The hat company, Young An Hat, is not entirely new to the bus business. A subsidiary, Young An Development, owns a bus assembly plant in Costa Rica. Don Kirk (NYT)
8/9/2002	G.M. to Shed 5 Midsize Models	The General Motors Corporation plans to cut 5 of its 15 midsize car models in the United States by 2006 as it tries to trim manufacturing and development costs and spend marketing dollars on fewer brands. The company intends to stay ahead of growing competition from automakers based overseas by offering fewer and more distinct models from Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick and Saturn, said Gene Stefanyshyn, the G.M. executive in charge of midsize vehicles. The automaker leads the category with more than 32 percent of sales.
8/9/2002	Pension Woes Bring Business Wealth Effect	GENERAL MOTORS has a problem. It has promised its workers big pensions and generous health care benefits when they retire. Paying for those promises will not be easy. Not that it is especially easy to figure that out from G.M.'s financial statements. Accounting rules do not force companies to immediately face up to bad news from their pension plans. So the balance sheet impact is delayed. Eventually, however, reality will win out, and General Motors will have to come up with the money.
8/7/2002	G.M. Plans to List Its Stock Options as Expenses	General Motors said today that it would start counting its stock options as an expense at the beginning of next year, becoming the first automaker to announce such a plan and joining a small number of companies, like General Electric and Coca-Cola, to do so. But G.M., the world's largest automaker, also said it believed that a better method of determining a stock option's value needed to be developed.
8/6/2002	G.M.'S SALARIED WORKERS TO GET MERIT RAISES OF 3.5%	The General Motors Corporation will award merit raises of about 3.5 percent on average to salaried workers this month after delaying the pay increases by two months to cut costs. The average raise is the same as last year and is for 53,000 employees in the United States and Canada, a spokesman, Tom Wickham, said. General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group delayed merit raises and cut or eliminated 401(k) matching programs this year to save money as price wars eroded revenue.
8/6/2002	G.M. Seeks Agency For Ethnic Account	General Motors will begin a review for its advertising aimed at Asian-American consumers, which had been handled by Innovasia in Los Angeles. Billings were estimated at $3 million.
8/4/2002	Private Sector; Having Too Much Fun to Leave	Is Robert A. Lutz planning to stick around longer at General Motors than his original three-year plan? At least one high-level hint has been dropped that he plans to do so. Mr. Lutz, 70, legendary for his automotive instincts, joined G.M. a year ago as vice chairman and all-around car czar. Since then, Mr. Lutz, a former Chrysler executive, has whirled through G.M.'s styling studios and engineering labs, putting new vehicles into development, tweaking those he thinks can be saved, killing those he thinks are beyond hope.
8/2/2002	Car Sales in Surprise Jump, And G.M. Leads the Pack	Car and truck sales in the United States rose a surprising 8.6 percent in July, largely because of aggressive incentives from automakers. The General Motors Corporation reinstated zero-percent financing early last month, a reprise of the incentives it offered after the Sept. 11 attacks. As a result, its combined car and truck sales led the industry, rising by 23.9 percent in July compared with figures for the month a year earlier.
7/28/2002	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Saturn Vue; A Small Plastic-Sided Slice of the Old General Motors	ONE could look at the 2002 Saturn Vue and see another small car-based sport utility wagon. Or one could see a 15-foot-long microcosm of what has gone wrong, as well as what's going right, at General Motors. On the negative side, the Vue demonstrates how slowly G.M., the world's largest automaker, has moved to give customers the kinds of vehicles they want. As the company's first small S.U.V. -- if you don't count the truckish Chevrolet Tracker, which is a Suzuki in a Chevy bow tie -- it has arrived more than six years after Toyota popularized the cute-ute segment with its RAV4.
7/28/2002	An Electric Feel Behind the Wheel	POWER steering helps to civilize driving -- as those old enough to recall the days of manual steering, when parallel parking doubled as an upper-body workout, can attest. Quiet, reliable and invisible, the hydraulic power-steering systems in nearly universal use today seem an unlikely spot for the application of radically different technology. But lightweight electric motors and computerized controls are likely to change the basic design of power steering. Compact all-electric systems promise to improve fuel efficiency and steering feel.
7/26/2002	A Chair Hoist With Mobility	Gary Talbot, 46, is fit enough to toss his folded wheelchair handily into the back of any car he happens to be driving, including his favorite Camaro. But in the 22 years since an auto accident left him without the use of his legs, he has watched other people struggle to load and secure motorized wheelchairs and electric scooters -- which can weigh up to 300 pounds -- into specially equipped vehicles, usually vans. As a manager of mobility engineering for General Motors, Mr. Talbot works on devices that adapt automobiles for use by people with disabilities. He saw a chance to make a change, and the result is an electronic hoist that lifts a wheelchair or scooter into the back of a vehicle and doesn't require permanent installation, as other devices do. Inside the vehicle, the wheelchair or scooter locks into a metal stanchion bolted to the back seat or seat belt anchors.
7/24/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Deal Endorsed	The European Union endorsed the takeover of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor by General Motors, saying it would have no anti-competitive effect in Europe. In Seoul, the government-owned Korea Development Bank, Daewoo's lead creditor, denied a report that four creditor banks refused to extend $2 billion in credit as part of the deal to form G.M.-Daewoo Auto Technology, the name of the company that G.M. is putting together from Daewoo's major entities. The deal calls for G.M. and allied companies, notably Suzuki Motor of Japan, to invest $400 million for a controlling stake in the company. The creditor banks will hold the remainder in hopes some day of recovering more than $19 billion in liabilities from Daewoo Motor. Don Kirk (NYT)
7/17/2002	G.M. Profit Doubles, but Worries on Pensions Hurt Stock	Profit at General Motors more than doubled in the second quarter, the company said today, but its pension liabilities and its investment in Fiat continued to pull down its stock price. Foremost among Wall Street's concerns is how much money G.M. will have to inject into its huge pension fund to offset the falling value of its stock investments and maintain payments to its more than 400,000 American retirees.
7/17/2002	Tax Breaks Are in Bill Closing Bermuda Loophole	A proposal to close a loophole that lets companies avoid taxes by acquiring a mailbox in Bermuda would force Boeing, Kodak, Disney and other large exporters to pay higher taxes, while giving new breaks to General Motors, Ford and other companies with factories overseas, supporters and critics of the plan said yesterday. The bill, which was introduced by House Republicans last week, would temporarily shut down a loophole that Stanley Works and other companies want to use to reduce or eliminate corporate income taxes by moving their nominal corporate headquarters to Bermuda, even while continuing to run their companies from offices in the United States.
7/17/2002	Canadian Auto Workers Open Talks With the Big 3	The union representing 46,000 Canadian auto workers began talks today with the big three North American automakers on a new labor contract that might set precedents for similar talks next year in the United States. There were signs that the local unit of General Motors would be the union's primary, and most accommodating, target. G.M., Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler all have closely integrated their American and Canadian operations, with assembly lines in each country producing vehicles for the entire North American market. But for the first time in many years, bargaining on labor contracts is not taking place simultaneously in the two countries.
7/16/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: A Mission For Fiat	Fiat is on a ''holy mission'' to fix its unprofitable car unit and is unlikely to sell it all to General Motors, said Robert Lutz, left, G.M.'s vice chairman. Fiat, Italy's largest manufacturer, sold 20 percent of its auto business, made up of the Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia brands, to G.M. in 2000 for $2.4 billion in stock. Fiat can force G.M. to buy the rest from 2004 to 2009. ''They want to remain autonomous and frankly, I hope they do, although I must confess I would love to see Alfa in the family,'' Mr. Lutz said in an interview.
7/15/2002	New Economy; Fuel-cell work is helping build research prowess for Detroit.	IN 1956, when General Motors opened its sprawling research center here, President Dwight D. Eisenhower praised it as a symbol of democratic capitalism's natural impulse to explore the frontiers of technology. G.M. executives declared their commitment to making the Warren research center ''one of the nation's great resources.'' Yet the research centers of Detroit -- Ford Motor opened one in 1953 -- never really rose to rival the labs of the information technology industry. A handful of computer and telecommunications companies, led by I.B.M.'s Watson Labs and AT&T's Bell Labs, were the places where the best and brightest minds gravitated to do pioneering work on everything from solid-state physics to software algorithms.
7/12/2002	Tall Orders? No Problem	Forty years ago, Studebaker came up with a novel feature for its Wagonaire station wagon: the rear part of the roof could be manually retracted into the front part, providing sky's-the-limit space to carry tall items -- armoires, trees, baby giraffes -- upright. Studebaker called the 1963 Wagonaire ''the world's only wagon convertible,'' but it wasn't enough to save the company, which folded three years later. Now, the retractable cargo roof is due to return on a General Motors sport utility vehicle, the 2004 Envoy XUV. This time, the roof is electrically operated: with the touch of a button, the rear section, above the cargo bay, slides forward.
7/10/2002	For Flint, Mich., Takeover Adds to the List of Woes	Even in a city used to hard knocks, this has been a bruising year. In March, Mayor Woodrow Stanley was recalled by voters frustrated with the city's deteriorating finances, and racial tensions simmered as the Rev. Al Sharpton came to rally support for the mayor, who is black.
7/7/2002	Detroit's High-Speed Pursuit of the Police Car Market	BAD boys, bad boys, what you gonna do when a Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor rolls up behind you? Officers suggest that you pull over, if requested, even if you think your getaway car can outrun the Interceptor, with its 235-horsepower V-8. ''The Ford is quick enough to reach pursuit speed without sacrificing distance between you and the car you are going after,'' said Police Officer Greg Reynolds of Chicago. ''And it can maintain speed. It can cruise at 120 all day if you have to.''
7/3/2002	G.M. Bucks Detroit Trend And Reports Higher Sales	A day after introducing an aggressive incentive plan, General Motors reported stronger June auto sales today even as sales by its Detroit-based rivals and the rest of the industry sagged. G.M. said its vehicle sales rose 4.3 percent in June compared with figures in the month a year earlier. Its market share climbed both for June and for the first half of 2001, thanks in part to its willingness to continue stimulating the market with incentives. In contrast, sales at DaimlerChrysler dropped 3.6 percent in June, while Ford Motor's sales dropped 10.7 percent.
7/2/2002	G.M. Plans To Resume No-Interest Financing	General Motors will announce a return to interest-free financing deals Tuesday. G.M., the world's largest automaker, offered interest-free financing across much of its lineup for several months after the Sept. 11 attacks. Early in the year it switched to rebates and lesser financing deals. But sales fell 12 percent in May from a year earlier, the first significant drop after months of growing sales.
6/30/2002	An Expanding Family of Army Brats	THE military Humvee was designed, engineered and built by AM General, which started selling the civilian version, called the Hummer, in 1992. After the company formed a joint venture with General Motors in December 1999, that original Hummer got a new name, H1. While never cheap, prices of the H1 have been creeping higher. The four-door wagon now starts at $113,824. Only about 1,000 are sold each year.
6/28/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Investor	Suzuki Motor of Japan has agreed to pay $89 million for a 14.9 percent stake in GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology, the company that General Motors is forming as a successor to the bankrupt Daewoo Motors. The portion held by Suzuki, which is 20 percent owned by G.M., will make it the second-largest investor after G.M., which will own 42.1 percent of the company. G.M. is still looking for another partner to invest 10 percent, enough to cover the entire $400 million that G.M. has said the group will pay for a 67 percent stake in the company. Don Kirk (NYT)
6/26/2002	Quality Goals In Incentives For Hospitals	Prodded by big employers and hospitals, one of the nation's largest nonprofit health plans will announce a financial payoff today for hospitals that meet widely accepted standards for high-quality care. Blue Shield of California is introducing the incentive program after sharp criticism by some of the state's best-known hospitals, which objected to a new system under which Blue Shield and a few other health plans publicized and favored certain hospitals solely on the basis of lower costs.
6/26/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: More Interest In Daewoo	Suzuki Motor of Japan said it would join General Motors as a partner in GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology, the company that has emerged from the complex deal under which General Motors is taking over the bankrupt Daewoo Motor. Suzuki Motor, in which G.M. has a 20 percent stake, said it would invest a significant but still undisclosed portion of the $400 million that G.M. has guaranteed as payment for two-thirds of the new company. G.M. has said it will own 42.1 percent of the company while its partners will own 24.9 percent. Fiat of Italy, in which G.M. also owns a minority stake, has also been mentioned as a possible partner. Don Kirk (NYT)
6/23/2002	Chevy's TrailBrazer Stretches a Point	WHEN General Motors brought out new midsize sport utility vehicles last year, the three models -- the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Oldsmobile Bravada -- only came with two rows of seats that would accommodate a maximum of five passengers. At the time, Honda's new seven-passenger Acura MDX was so popular it was selling over list price and still in short supply. Honda was planning a production increase and a second version, the eight-passenger Honda Pilot (which ultimately went on sale this month). Ford was introducing a new Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer, both available with a third-row seat.
6/23/2002	G.M. REPRIEVE IN LINDEN	General Motors last week announced it would give its light truck assembly plant in Linden a one-year reprieve on a scheduled 2004 closing. With the extension to 2005, about 1,800 workers will be able to stay on the job, many just long enough to qualify for immediate access to retirement benefits under the union contract. State economic development officials are trying to put together a package of grants and incentives they hope will help induce the automomaker to bring a new product line into the 65-year-old plant. Ford had earlier announced plans to close its light truck assembly plant in Edison by 2004. Ronald Smothers
6/14/2002	G.M. Beat Ford in Efficiency, A Study of Auto Plants Finds	Last year, for the first time since a closely watched study began tracking productivity, General Motors was more efficient than the Ford Motor Company in building cars. But both companies, along with DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, continue to trail Asian competitors in productivity and profitability. The gap remains wide, even though the three major Asian automakers -- Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan -- slipped a bit last year.
6/5/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Chairman Returns	Fiat's honorary chairman, Gianni Agnelli, left, returned to Italy yesterday after having medical treatment in the United States for a prostate condition. His return raised speculation that Fiat would sell 80 percent of its car unit to General Motors. Mr. Agnelli, whose grandfather founded the company in 1899, is seen as the leading opponent of such a sale; the Agnelli family controls 34 percent of Fiat, which has debt of 6.6 billion euros ($6.21 billion). At a news conference, the chief executive, Giancarlo Boschetti, denied rumors that the company had been contacted by General Motors and predicted that Fiat would break even in 2003. Kerry Shaw (NYT)
6/5/2002	General Motors Chairman Announces He'll Retire Next Year	John F. Smith Jr. said today that he would step down next year as chairman of General Motors when he reaches the company's retirement age of 65. During his decade-long tenure at the top of the world's largest automaker, Mr. Smith was credited with greatly improving efficiency and transforming G.M. from a disparate group of competing brands to a unified company. Of late, the company has even halted a long decline in market share.
6/4/2002	Vehicle Sales Fell in May Even as Big Rebates Continued	Weak sales in May at General Motors helped drag car sales to their lowest monthly pace in nearly four years. Auto sales industrywide fell 6 percent in May from the month a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich.
5/31/2002	G.M. Rises and Nissan Falls in J.D. Power Quality Survey	General Motors rose to third place in this year's quality ranking surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, the best performance for a domestic manufacturer since the study's methodology was changed in 1998. The Ford Motor Company also rose in the closely watched initial quality survey, which examines how cars perform in their first 90 days, as did DaimlerChrysler, the parent of the Chrysler Group. Ford moved from seventh place to fifth in the survey. DaimlerChrysler moved from fifth to fourth.
5/30/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: France: G.M. Drops Michelin	General Motors, which is pressing suppliers to cut costs, said it had dropped Michelin as a provider of premium tires in Europe because the French company's products are too expensive. Michelin said it decided not to renew the agreement. General Motors still has contracts with Michelin in the United States, which last until 2006 and 2007. Michelin makes about one-fifth of the world's tires. Continental A.G. said it would take over part of the contract to supply tires to General Motors' European division.
5/30/2002	Western Companies Warm to Russia	The seals of approval are coming thick and fast for President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia these days. Today, the European Union said it would recognize Russia as a market economy, an upgrading of its status under the union's trade regulations and a designation that Moscow had sought for years. In a statement, Romano Prodi, president of the union's executive body, the European Commission, called it ''fit and proper'' that the 15-nation union ''reward the considerable efforts'' Russia has made to remake its economy.
5/27/2002	In New Era, Corporate Security Looks Beyond Guns and Badges	HELP WANTED: Chief Security Officer. Ominously, vaguely, federal officials are again warning Americans to be on alert for some sort of terrorist attack. Will corporate America be ready?
5/25/2002	CONSUMER CONCERNS ON AUTO RELIABILITY CITED	An internal General Motors Corporation report shows that a quarter of United States consumers avoid its vehicles because of reliability concerns, even though complaints by new-car owners fell 10 percent in the last year. The automaker is taking steps to improve quality as it prepares to replace 43 percent of its models next year. Its market share has slipped to less than 30 percent from 50 percent four decades ago.
5/17/2002	MARSICO CAPITAL BUYS 7 MILLION SHARES OF G.M. STOCK	Marsico Capital Management, run by Thomas F. Marsico, the former Janus Capital manager, bought more than seven million shares of General Motors stock in the first quarter. The purchase by the Marsico group, a unit of Bank of America, was worth about $450 million, according to Bigdough.com, which tracks securities filings. The purchase makes G.M., which was previously not held by Mr. Marsico's group, one of its top 10 holdings. Recently, G.M.'s sales and market share have shown signs of improvement after years of stagnation, and analysts have said the company has reduced its cost structure. Another fund group, Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest, more than doubled its stake in G.M. in the first quarter, to 10.5 million shares, according to filings. Danny Hakim (NYT)
5/15/2002	Daewoo Leaves Foreign Plants Adrift	There is a conspicuously empty space on the wall of the president's office at Daewoo-FSO Motor here, where a portrait of the Daewoo Group's founder and former chairman, Kim Woo Choong, once held pride of place. Chairman Kim, as he was known, led a frenzied half-decade of expansion that began in the early 1990's. During that time, Daewoo took over or built more than a dozen car and truck plants in a dozen post-Communist or developing nations. Daewoo added the Polish carmaker FSO in 1995 and replaced its clunky Polonez cars with sleek new Korean models.
5/10/2002	The Eldorado Sips Its Last Tanker of Gas	THE final Cadillac Eldorado rolled off the assembly line last month in Lansing, Mich., an alpine white car destined for the company's museum. The current model is a personal luxury coupe, but for 50 years the Eldorado name has been attached to a variety of Cadillacs. While the Eldorado name is gone for now, it is too valuable to be abandoned forever. As with other recently retired names, like the Lincoln Continental and the Chevrolet Camaro, Eldorado is likely to show up on a future Cadillac. For now, however, Cadillac is using abbreviated names, like CTS and XLR.
5/7/2002	Cadillac On Marquee At Winter Garden	In the latest indication of a growing corporate presence on Broadway, the Shubert Organization announced yesterday that it had struck a deal with General Motors to rename its historic Winter Garden Theater the Cadillac Winter Garden. The announcement, made by the Shubert president, Philip J. Smith, culminates two years of on-and-off negotiation between the theater company and the automaker. It marks the first time that one of the three major Broadway theater chains -- the Shuberts, Jujamcyn and the Nederlanders -- has sold the rights to a Broadway theater's name.
5/7/2002	Cadillac Recasts Itself as a Full-Line Manufacturer	Cadillac, which until recently had embodied the essence of conservatism, embraces risk these days. Its latest endeavor will be introduced on Tuesday, the Cadillac SRX. Of all things, it is a people hauler -- sort of a minivan, sort of a station wagon -- with room for seven that the company plans to start selling by the middle of next year.
5/6/2002	Hyundai Joins 2 Automakers In Planning For Engine	Hyundai Motor, the South Korean carmaker, forged an alliance today with DaimlerChrysler of Germany and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan to work on engines that all three companies can use in their cars. The chief executives of the three companies initialed an agreement today to form a company, the Global Engine Alliance, just five days after General Motors signed a contract to take over most of Daewoo Motor in 60 to 90 days.
5/3/2002	FORD FOLLOWS G.M. IN BACKING OFF NO-INTEREST LOANS	Ford Motor joined General Motors yesterday in backing away from no-interest loans on new cars and trucks. Ford raised some cash discounts by $500 to $3,000, matching a level set by General Motors two days ago. Industrywide auto sales rose in April for the first time this year. The increased demand may help build profit at General Motors and cut losses at Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, analysts said. Ford's latest incentive program, which runs through July 1, continues the zero percent financing on some vehicles in some regions.
5/2/2002	Auto Sales Increased 2.9% in April; Only Ford Lagged	Every major automaker except Ford Motor reported sales increases last month, evidence of an economic recovery that helped propel the stock market today. Over all, automobile sales in the United States rose 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
5/2/2002	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in World Business yesterday about large takeover deals in South Korea misstated the ranking of Daewoo Motor, whose main assets are being acquired by General Motors. It is the third largest automaker in the country, behind Hyundai and Kia, not the fourth.
4/30/2002	G.M. Is Set To Complete A Takeover Of Daewoo	General Motors concluded two years of negotiations for Daewoo Motor today, saying that it would sign an agreement on Tuesday to take over Daewoo for an initial payment of $400 million. A deal would give General Motors a major production foothold in Asia, home of some of the fastest-growing auto markets. More important, the success of the negotiations for Daewoo was expected to bolster the South Korean government's efforts to encourage foreign investment as it tries to revitalize the economy.
4/30/2002	Auto Parts Makers Grinding to a Halt	For decades, Tom Libera stood securely on the first rung of the industrial ladder. Now he may be about to fall off. His small one-story shop, J & T Tool and Die, is surrounded by empty fields, at the base of Saginaw Bay just out of town. Inside, Mr. Libera, 43, shows off some of his wares -- basic elements of manufacturing that meld into the mechanisms of American life.
4/26/2002	A New Swagger at G.M.	It's always nice to record a success story, no matter how fleeting success might turn out to be. It is especially nice if the story occurs in Detroit, a cyclical city that seems to have more downs than ups. The success story belongs to General Motors, which after years of decline is now on an upswing -- a tribute to uncharacteristically daring designs, a tighter cost structure and, so far as anyone knows, no accounting tricks. Leaving aside for the moment the deleterious environmental impact of G.M.'s S.U.V.'s and some of its newer creations -- the improbable Cadillac pickup truck, for example -- the company's products might finally begin to appeal to what the marketing people call a younger demographic. G.M. has been down so long that many people have forgotten that in the 1950's, the company controlled over 60 percent of the American market. Today its market share is 28 percent. Over the years G.M. has suffered from a defensive management strategy, terrible labor relations and stodgy, one-size-fits-all styling. There were times in the early 90's when you couldn't tell a Chevrolet from a Pontiac from an Oldsmobile from a Buick. Even Cadillac lost its old grandeur, surrendering up-market dominance to Lincoln. The net result was that first Chrysler, then Ford began to challenge G.M. in the showrooms and among investors. All three, of course, suffered from foreign competition.
4/18/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Deal Expected	The government-owned Korea Development Bank said that the chairman of General Motors, John F. Smith Jr., would sign a long-awaited agreement on Tuesday for G.M. to take over the bankrupt Daewoo Motor. The deal is complex, however, and the bank said negotiators still had to resolve unfinished issues and to complete contracts before then. The deal was made possible in part by a vote by Daewoo's labor union members, who approved it on the promise that G.M. would keep all 13,000 workers on the payroll. GM-Daewoo Korea, the name of the company to be formed under the agreement, will own two modern Daewoo Motor plants and will lease an antiquated plant in the Pupyong section of Inchon for six years before deciding whether to buy it. Don Kirk (NYT)
4/17/2002	G.M. Exceeds Estimates and Sees a Rise in Production	The revival of General Motors continued today as it reported only a slight decrease in earnings, well above analysts' expectations, despite financial difficulties at its European unit. G.M., the world's largest automaker, said it would step up its projections for North American output, and it also increased its forecast for industry sales this year -- both pieces of good news for the economy. The company raised its 2002 earnings estimate to $5 a share from $3.50.
4/14/2002	Investing; Yellow Flag May Be Out for Parts Makers	STRONG car sales have propelled the shares of auto parts manufacturers, the mostly small to midsize companies that sell to giants like Ford and General Motors. As the broader stock market drifted sideways during the first quarter, the stocks of some of these companies rose 20 percent to 50 percent. As a group, auto parts makers are up 28 percent this year, as measured by the Dow Jones Auto Parts Index, which has risen 61 percent from its 52-week low on Sept. 21.
4/14/2002	Red Robot With Blue Collar Gets a Blue Ribbon	The little red robot that could has made it all the way to Orlando, Fla., from its humble birthplace on Flatbush Avenue. The question now is: can the underdog robot from Brooklyn conquer the world? The students from Science Skills Center High School, in Downtown Brooklyn, didn't have the same resources as many of the schools they competed against in the regional finals of a national robotics competition March 23. The regionals, organized by the educational support group First (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), were held at Columbia University.
4/11/2002	Agreement For Takeover Of Daewoo	After months of talks, General Motors and the creditors of Daewoo Motor, the bankrupt Korean carmaker, have reached a detailed understanding on a takeover of most of Daewoo. The terms are much more favorable for G.M. than those outlined in a general memorandum of understanding when the talks began last September, the governor of the government-run Korea Development Bank, the lead creditor in the talks with G.M., said today.
4/10/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Workers To Keep Jobs	All 13,000 workers at Daewoo Motor, the bankrupt manufacturer, will keep their jobs after General Motors takes it over, according to an agreement between Daewoo and the workers' union. The agreement, which also calls for Daewoo to rehire 300 workers who were laid off last year, removes a major stumbling block to concluding an agreement between General Motors and Daewoo's creditors, led by the government-owned Korea Development Bank. General Motors and the Korea Development Bank have completed virtually all details of the agreement, which calls for General Motors to pay $400 million for a controlling stake in a new company that will emerge from the deal.

4/7/2002	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Cadillac CTS; Turning 100, Sparkling Like a Gem	THREE years ago, Cadillac was running on fumes. Its products were stale and its technology was dated. Import-luxury competitors (BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz, among them) were eating its brunch. As executives started to plan the centennial of the General Motors division, it wasn't clear who would be around in 2002 to blow out the candles. What Cadillac did have was the Evoq, a design study for a roadster with lines cut like the facets of a diamond, intended to chart a new course for Cadillac styling. The Evoq's fractal geometric style was called, grandly, Art and Science, and it was futuristic, stiff and not very friendly. The look was polarizing. Early reviews were unflattering, and there was plenty of room for self-doubt.
4/7/2002	Turning 100 And Putting On the Gloves	AFTER a decade on the ropes, Cadillac has come out swinging. It has a new and fundamentally different midsize car, the CTS, being built in a new $560 million plant in Lansing, Mich. Its heavy-metal commercials fill the airwaves, and its Escalade S.U.V. is the hip-hop prop of the moment. Coming next year are the XLR, a luxury roadster based on the Evoq show car, and the SRX, a sporty touring wagon that will compete with the Audi Allroad. In 2004, a new large sedan will replace the Seville. Called the STS, it will be a rear-drive car with an all-wheel-drive option and fractal styling inspired by the Imaj concept car.
4/4/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Posts Loss	The bankrupt Daewoo Motor, in the final throes of negotiations for a takeover by General Motors, reported a net loss of $2.73 billion last year, despite an operating profit of approximately $8 billion. Company officials credited restructuring efforts with cutting last year's net loss by 70 percent from 2000. The company sold only 466,254 vehicles last year, down 40 percent from 2000, but said sales in the first quarter of this year had risen by 2.4 percent from the first quarter of 2001. According to a spokesman, Daewoo's chairman, Lee Jong Dae, said the takeover negotiations might end this month, with G.M. agreeing not to lay off workers. Don Kirk (NYT)
4/3/2002	Auto Sales Strong in March as Recovery Continues	Solid auto sales in March pointed to a continuing economic recovery, though domestic automakers have not been able to break the cycle of losing market share to foreign competitors. General Motors, the healthiest of the Big Three automakers, was able to hold its share of the market steady in the first quarter, a victory compared with the struggles of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler. Analysts are growing bullish on G.M. because its sales have also become more profitable. Retail sales have risen while rental car companies and corporate fleets have cut back sharply on less lucrative bulk purchases during the downturn.
4/1/2002	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Thursday about plans by General Motors to revive the Pontiac G.T.O. misstated the name of a song about the car and an artist who recorded it. The song was ''G.T.O.,'' not ''Little G.T.O.'' It was recorded by Ronny & the Daytonas, not Ronnie.
3/28/2002	Time Warp at G.M.: G.T.O. Is Returning	General Motors said yesterday that it planned to revive the Pontiac G.T.O., an American muscle car icon, by modifying a sports coupe it sells in Australia. The old G.T.O., which was sold from the 1964 to 1974 model years and nicknamed the Goat, was the first of a string of muscle cars in that era that appealed to young men looking for affordable cars with plenty of horsepower. The muscle car has been in decline in recent decades as drivers have drifted to larger vehicles like S.U.V.'s and pickups.
3/24/2002	The Cars That Car Designers Like to Look at	IF you want to rub elbows with automobile designers, there's no place like a car show to see the men and women who shaped the look and feel of the car in your driveway. But what do the designers themselves look at when they stroll the exhibition hall? The New York International Auto Show opens to the public on Friday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Earlier in the week, industry movers and shakers (and more than a few designers) will be on hand to unveil their latest dream cars (and real cars) to the press.
3/24/2002	Business; The New Accountability: Tracking the Social Costs	THE Enron-Andersen debacle has cast an unforgiving light on corporate bookkeeping, but the growing demand for accountability could extend far beyond financial statements. Pressure from investors, customers, consumer activists and even some governments is pushing more companies, particularly multinational ones, to report their nonfinancial performance, detailing the impact of their businesses on the environment and human rights. This so-called social reporting has been under way since the late 1980's, when corporations, reacting to the growing environmental movement, began publishing brochures about reducing pollution. But many of those early efforts produced little more than glossy propaganda.
3/22/2002	How Old Fashioned: Cars Built on Frames	RETRO, a hot design trend for several years, may be more than skin deep. To make niche models at reasonable prices, General Motors is reviving a car-building method -- bolting bodies onto solid frames -- that had almost disappeared. What's more, the change could revive the frequent restylings that gave pizazz to cars of the 1950's and 60's. Later this year, G.M. will begin selling the Chevrolet SSR, a sporty convertible pickup. A low-volume model, its manufacturing cost is reduced because the SSR's distinctive body will be attached to a version of the frame that supports G.M.'s midsize Envoy and TrailBlazer sport utilities.
3/20/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Auto Talks Continue	General Motors still hopes to end the talks for taking over Daewoo Motor by next month, according to a G.M. regional spokesman, Rob Leggatt. G.M. officials have met leaders of Daewoo's union, which has demanded guarantees that workers will not lose their jobs if G.M. takes over. Mr. Leggatt said issues remain, including that of a collective bargaining agreement with the union. Lee Young Kook, president of Daewoo Motor, said G.M. and Daewoo negotiators, led by the company's lead creditor, the government-owned Korea Development Bank, face only minor differences.

3/15/2002	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; The Big 3 Sit and Honk Outside Korea's Garage	JAE H. JUNG doesn't look like a global warrior as he edges his black Lincoln LS sedan through the crush of midday traffic. But as the recently appointed president of the Ford Motor Company's Korean sales operation, Mr. Jung is storming the ramparts of a market in which 1.4 million cars were sold last year -- and in which Ford sold just 400. As he seeks to expand that nearly infinitesimal market share, he faces not only fierce cultural resistance to foreign cars, but complex import duties and ever-shifting safety and emission standards. ''It's a tough challenge,'' said Mr. Jung, 42. ''But I like it.''
3/11/2002	Stock Options Are Faulted By Buffett	Warren E. Buffett, using the forum that the Berkshire Hathaway annual report provides, has renewed his attack against the widespread use of stock options and at the ways corporations assure that executives will profit from options even if the company's share price declines. Mr. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, argued that stock options often do not give executives the same stake as shareholders have, since the shareholders will suffer if the price declines.
3/10/2002	Private Sector; Tearing Down Corporate Walls	It's unusual for a mayor to order jackhammers into the headquarters of the most important corporate citizen. But that is what the new mayor of Detroit, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, did to General Motors last week. And he had G.M.'s blessing. Mr. Kilpatrick, 31, gave the ceremonial command to start destruction of two three-story-high concrete berms outside G.M.'s Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit. The structures were built in the 1970's as protection in the event of more riots like those in the city in 1967. The berms are a vestige of a divided Detroit, walling off a symbol of business from a largely African-American population.
3/7/2002	Engine Defects in a Few New Cadillacs	Cadillac acknowledged today that it had encountered engine failures on a small number of its new CTS sedans, whose success is critical to the renaissance of the venerable brand. The problem was found on fewer than 10 cars, and has been fixed, said Jim Taylor, the vehicle line executive at General Motors who was in charge of CTS. Cadillac halted shipments of cars from its factory in Lansing, Mich., during the final week of January to make sure that defective vehicles did not reach customers.
3/3/2002	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS; A Moving Tribute To a Racing Legend	A BLINDING cloudburst envelops Interstate 95, but nobody hits the brakes. It is the beginning of Speed Week, the annual hajj of racing fans to Nascar's signature event, the Daytona 500, and the road is crowded with pilgrims' pickups and recreational vehicles. Many wear decals declaring their allegiances: No. 24, the car number of Jeff Gordon, four-time Winston Cup Champion; No. 29 for Kevin Harvick, the 2001 Rookie of the Year; and No. 6 for Mark Martin, the grizzled veteran who bears the burden of the Viagra-Pfizer sponsorship more gracefully than anyone could have hoped.
3/3/2002	Investing; Is It G.M.'s Turn to Be the Favorite?	AS it time to buy General Motors? For years, G.M. was deep in the woodshed of most professional investors. With its market share cut in half since 1960 and with cars described as bland at best, the company was not appealing.
3/2/2002	Chevrolet Sales Surpass Ford's For First Time In 10 Years	Chevrolet outsold the Ford brand in February for the first month in more than a decade, industry figures showed today, further highlighting the resurgence of the General Motors Corporation and the struggles of the Ford Motor Company. George Pipas, Ford's manager of industry sales analysis, said of G.M. during a conference call about February sales that ''I would say congratulations if they've managed to pull that off.''
3/1/2002	JUDGE RULES IN G.M.'S FAVOR IN TRADEMARK DISPUTE	The grille of the Hummer H2, made by General Motors, does not violate the trademark design of DaimlerChrysler's Jeep vehicles, a federal judge has ruled. DaimlerChrysler sued G.M. last year, saying the grille of the Hummer H2 sport utility vehicle was too much like the Jeep grille. But Judge Robert Miller Jr. of Federal District Court in South Bend, Ind., said in a ruling posted on the court's Web site, ''Nothing in the record indicates any intent on General Motors' part to palm off the H2 as a Jeep, or to exploit consumers' association with Jeep.'' G.M. has said that changing the grille design would cost $100 million. The H2 is set to go on sale in July.
2/26/2002	Some spots fell short, but other commercials during Olympics were worthy of the gold.	AS the sun slowly sets on the tantrums, Roots berets and disqualifications of the 19th Olympic Winter Games, we bid a fond farewell to the trillions of commercials that appeared on NBC, CNBC and MSNBC and collectively exclaim, ''Well, it could have been worse.'' Because the Olympic commercials began only five days after a Super Bowl that was replete with tacky, tasteless and hyperpatriotic spots, there had been little hope that Madison Avenue could avoid a second straight stumble. But many commercials shown during the 17 days of the Winter Games were surprisingly better than expected, certainly surpassing the botched batches that made viewers cringe during the last few Olympics.
2/26/2002	THE MARKETS: Market Place; What's Good For the Country Is Good for G.M.	General Motors, citing a stronger-than-expected outlook for domestic auto sales, raised its estimate for first-quarter earnings today, increased production and set an aggressive profit goal for the middle of the decade. ''Over all, we're feeling reasonably good about where this market is and where we are,'' said John Devine, the chief financial officer at G.M., the world's largest automaker. ''Certainly on the product side, we're beginning to get some momentum for the first time in some time.''
2/19/2002	G.M. Keeps Options Open On Director	The General Motors Corporation today responded to news reports that a prominent Swedish industrialist might be forced off the board because of a controversy in his home country, saying it was not certain that the matter would even be discussed at its directors' meeting next month. The board member, Percy Barnevik, has come under increasing scrutiny in Europe because of the size of the retirement package he received after stepping down last November as chairman of ABB, Europe's biggest electrical engineering company.
2/17/2002	Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Toyota	IN the cafeteria, there are sticky rice and hush puppies, soy sauce and ketchup, chopsticks and forks. This is Toyota, bluegrass style.
2/16/2002	Linden G.M. Workers Take Wait-and-See Approach as They Face Layoffs	The last time there were layoffs at the General Motors Corporation plant here, Guy Messina, shop chairman of the union local, had to go onto the plant floor to answer questions about them. He was roundly booed by the members. On Thursday, when Mr. Messina joined other union and company officials to announce that 1,100 of the plant's 2,300 workers would be laid off by April 15, people were polite, and some even applauded.
2/15/2002	G.M. Plans To Lay Off 3,000 People	General Motors said today that it planned to lay off nearly 3,000 workers at two plants, including 1,100 at a truck plant in Linden, N.J. The cuts are the second tremor New Jersey has felt from Detroit's belt tightening, which comes after a year of big sales but shrinking profits.
2/8/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Bid Is Revised	The General Motors Corporation has submitted a revised bid for Daewoo Motor, Jung Keun Yong, governor of the Bank of Korea, told members of the National Assembly in Seoul. The proposal, in negotiation with Daewoo's lead creditor, the government-owned Korea Development Bank, reportedly asks for guarantees in case of discovery of hidden debts accumulated by the bankrupt manufacturer overseas. Don Kirk (NYT)
2/8/2002	Jeep to Hummer: Wipe That Grin Off Your Face	Tt is not Tyson vs. Lewis, but Jeep and Hummer bared their teeth this week in United States District Court in South Bend, Ind. DaimlerChrysler, which owns Jeep, asked Judge Robert L. Miller to temporarily bar General Motors and AM General, which build and distribute Hummers under a partnership agreement, from selling their ''baby Hummer'' unless they change its Jeeplike grille. The Hummer H2 is to reach dealers in July. DaimlerChrysler wants sales delayed until the court hears a trademark-infringement suit -- or H2 gets a nose job. The company says the grille, with seven openings, is too similar to Jeep's 60-year-old design.
2/4/2002	Shift of Emphasis In Saturn Campaign	A shift of emphasis in Saturn advertising, while retaining core elements of the car brand's current campaigns, is coming after the surprising change in agencies disclosed last week. Saturn, a division of General Motors, is dismissing Publicis & Hal Riney in San Francisco, a unit of the Publicis Groupe, after a transition period of several months. Riney was hired by Saturn in 1988 and created all the car line's advertising since its introduction in 1990, including the familiar theme, ''A different kind of company, a different kind of car.''
2/3/2002	A Turning Point for Big Trucks	AS full-size pickups have grown into plus sizes, they have become ever harder to squeeze into tight quarters. Now, with the Quadrasteer four-wheel-steering system, engineers at General Motors and Delphi Automotive Systems have come up with a way to cut a big truck down to size. Quadrasteer can make the GMC Sierra Denali, the only vehicle on which it is currently available, seem as maneuverable as a family sedan. It's as though one of J. R. R. Tolkien's plodding trolls had acquired the wiry agility of Gollum.
2/3/2002	BEHIND THE WHEEL/GMC Sierra Denali; Tucking $44,105 Under the Bed	CARMAKERS are breeding their workhorse pickups into show horses, and this new breed of steeds is a quantum leap over the utilitarian hay haulers of grandpa's time. Today's truck buyers clearly like to be coddled and amused, and many are willing to pay dearly for buttery leather upholstery, premium stereo sound and the latest technological bells and whistles. Although prices of full-size pickups begin around $16,000, the selling price of the typical full-size pickup is $30,000, General Motors says.
2/1/2002	Saturn Account Expected to Shift	Publicis & Hal Riney in San Francisco, the only agency to have handled the Saturn car line since General Motors introduced it in 1990, is losing the assignment, with billings estimated at more than $300 million, to Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, advertising executives briefed on the G.M. decision say. The decision, which the executives discussed yesterday only on the condition of anonymity, came as Riney, part of the Publicis Groupe, and Goodby, Silverstein, part of the Omnicom Group, vied in a review for an assignment to handle the Ion line of cars Saturn is to introduce in the fall.
1/29/2002	Bargain Acquisitions Evaporate in Korea	The Korean fire sale appears to be ending. Foreign companies that as recently as last fall were nearly begged to come to Seoul in a mood to buy huge, deeply indebted Korean companies are now finding that improving economic prospects and a rising stock market have given the Koreans across the negotiating table new confidence and a new resistance to selling at bargain prices.
1/27/2002	Private Sector; The Heavy Metal Car	For decades, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page have fiercely guarded the image of Led Zeppelin, but their resolve appears to have weakened. The 70's purveyors of big hair and bigger riffs have sold their song ''Rock and Roll'' to Cadillac. Cadillac? For G.M.'s luxury brand, this seems something of an incongruous choice. But Cadillac has been trying for years to be associated with anything but Lawrence Welk fans. Its new CTS sedan, a futuristic vision of crisp angles, is also making a paid appearance in the next ''Matrix'' installment, a film driven by techno-rockers like Rob Zombie. And Cadillac's Escalade S.U.V., known as Slade on the street, has become an icon for rappers.
1/20/2002	In the Region/New Jersey; Golf Course Complex Is Rising on Former G.M. Site	THE contrast is striking. On one side of Raritan Road here in central New Jersey, white fumes spew from a factory's smokestack and drift like snow clouds through the sky. On the other side, green acres extend for miles. Mingled with the greenery are a 9-hole golf course, an 18-hole miniature course and a lighted 40-station driving range. Posts also mark the spot where a clubhouse and restaurant will rise in the next five months and complete the Hyatt Hills Golf Course and Complex on almost 88 former industrial and polluted acres that spill into neighboring Cranford.
1/17/2002	Earnings Fall in a Tough Market, but G.M. Ekes Out a Profit	General Motors sold more automobiles and had higher revenue in the fourth quarter than it did a year earlier, but its earnings fell 58 percent. The divergent results were a symptom of G.M.'s interest-free financing deals after Sept. 11. G.M. will be the only one of the Big Three automakers to record a profit in 2001 on either an operating or net basis -- that distinction is an achievement in a year marred by terrorist attacks and a recession. The company reported a 2001 net profit of $601 million, or $1.77 a share, compared with $6.68 a share in 2000. It earned $1.5 billion, or $3.23 a share, on an operating basis.
1/13/2002	Private Sector; Running on His Own Schedule	Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors, has made one thing clear since jumping from Chrysler: he will operate his way. Most executive schedules at G.M. are set months in advance. But last Wednesday, Mr. Lutz showed up unannounced at the opening of G.M.'s new assembly plant in Lansing, Mich. Planners scampered to rearrange the V.I.P. seating. Last Tuesday, Mr. Lutz trotted around the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, giving blunt assessments of the cars displayed by G.M.'s competition. His biggest power play came last weekend, when he suddenly chose to include the Pontiac Solstice roadster in G.M.'s lineup of concept cars at the show. G.M. had not planned to display it until later this year. His instincts proved right: the Solstice was a hit. Micheline Maynard
1/12/2002	FORD PLANS TO CUT 35,000 EMPLOYEES AND SHUT 5 PLANTS	The Ford Motor Company announced its most sweeping cutbacks in two decades today, terminating 35,000 workers, closing five plants and dropping four models. No longer will the company make Lincoln Continentals or Ford Escorts, as it cuts North American capacity by nearly a million cars and trucks a year.
1/10/2002	Dream Car: A Dressed-Up Skateboard	THE car of the future, according to General Motors, will have its engine encased in the floor and need no gasoline. It will also have a body and interior that can be replaced as moods change, electronically connected components instead of mechanical parts, and a power source that can serve your home from the driveway. A mockup of the car is on display here this week at the North American International Auto Show. This concept vehicle, called the Autonomy, has few moving parts other than the wheels and is part of G.M.'s continuing research into cars powered by fuel cells, a source that holds the promise of emitting only water and heat by relying on hydrogen instead of gas.
1/6/2002	All That Easy Credit Haunts Detroit Now	WHEN the North American International Auto Show, the Cannes Film Festival of the auto industry, opens here today, the Ford Motor Company will put on a display of its new vehicles. The company hopes to make its mark with a redesigned version of its Expedition S.U.V. and a station wagon from its Volvo unit that looks like it wants to be an S.U.V. But the big news will come at the end of the week, after the show ends. That is when Ford is expected to announce a plan to return to profitability by reversing the company's declining quality, cutting costs and perhaps closing plants to ease overcapacity.
1/5/2002	Toyota Says It Will Build Mexico Plant	The Toyota Motor Company announced plans yesterday to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico, a move analysts described as crucial to Toyota's attempt to displace Chrysler as the third-best-selling auto company in the United States market. Toyota was evasive about its plans for the plant, which would be built on a 700-acre site outside Tijuana in Baja California. The carmaker said the plant, which is expected to open in 2004, would make truck beds for pickup trucks built at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., its plant in Fremont, Calif., that is a joint venture with General Motors.
1/4/2002	Incentives Prop Up Sales but May Haunt Carmakers Later	Auto sales, propelled by low-cost financing, finished the year slightly below a record set in 2000, according to data released today. But expectations for 2002 are pessimistic because of the economy as well as the dent that the incentives have probably made in demand. Carmakers ended 2001 with sales of about 17.1 million vehicles, down slightly from the record 17.3 million in sales a year earlier. Few analysts expected such a strong performance last summer, when industry sales were lagging, and the Sept. 11 attacks all but halted showroom traffic.
12/30/2001	Closing the Trunk Lid On a Topsy-Turvy 2001	THINK back to 1998. Chrysler was the hottest company around, with fresh products, a can-do attitude and an $8 billion hoard of cash. Two years later, Ford was on top of the auto world. It had plunged into the dot-com economy, built a stable of European luxury brands and seemed poised to dislodge General Motors as the largest carmaker.
12/21/2001	Cadillac, Too, Shifting Focus To Trucks	Cadillac has built a pickup truck the Cadillac of pickups, nearly three tons worth, available in sable black, white diamond or silver sand, with the familiar Cadillac coat of arms stretched across its hulking grill. By rolling out an 18-foot-long Cadillac Escalade EXT pickup last month, with a sticker price of $50,000, General Motors is acknowledging, to some degree, that the Cadillac sedan's place in popular culture and its long hold on the aspirations of the affluent has been lost. It is also sanctifying America's love affair with trucks.
12/21/2001	Autos On Friday/Design; G.M. Turns the Corner And Rediscovers Style	LAST January, when Robert A. Lutz described future-car designs at the Detroit auto show as ''angry kitchen appliances,'' his put-down no doubt included vehicles from General Motors, which was widely derided for its bizarre Pontiac Aztek. Next month, Mr. Lutz, former president of Chrysler, will hold court at the show as vice chairman of G.M.'s North American operations, and the company's concept cars will have come from his kitchen. When he arrived at G.M. last summer, Mr. Lutz declared in an internal memorandum that its designs were being ''corporate criteria-ed to death.'' In contrast, relying more on instinct than on market studies, he had made innovative design a hallmark of Chrysler, with fresh cars like the Dodge Viper and Chrysler PT Cruiser.
12/20/2001	JUSTICE DEPARTMENT QUESTIONS ECHOSTAR DEAL	As part of its inquiry into a plan by EchoStar Communications to buy Hughes Electronics and its DirecTV operation from General Motors, the Justice Department has issued a second request for information about the deal, executives close to the companies said yesterday. The second request, which was widely expected, signals a new, more aggressive phase of the inquiry into the proposed transaction's effects on competition. Opponents of the deal contend that it would create a monopoly on satellite television in the United States, while the companies say the merger is necessary to create a true competitor to the cable industry. Andrew Ross Sorkin (NYT)
12/16/2001	Sleepy Hollow Makes Down Payment on G.M. Site	Sleepy Hollow has decided to buy 97 acres on the Hudson River from its owner, the General Motors Corporation, after waiting more than five years for the redevelopment of the former auto plant site. The village mayor, Philip E. Zegarelli, notified the company earlier this month, and sent a check for $120,000 as a down payment on a purchase price of $12 million, the value put on the land for tax purposes.
12/13/2001	Berlin Cameron Agency Won't Seek G.M. Work	Berlin Cameron & Partners in New York has decided not to participate in a review now getting under way for the Saturn division of General Motors to select an agency to create campaigns for the new Ion coupe and sedan. Billings were estimated at $30 million to $100 million. The decision came as Berlin Cameron is being acquired by the WPP Group in London. The other worldwide agency networks of WPP -- Ogilvy & Mather, J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam -- handle advertising for the Ford Motor Company, which creates a conflict.
12/12/2001	Westchester Village Decides to Buy G.M. Site on Hudson	In a sign of growing impatience here, village officials have decided to buy the site of a former automotive assembly plant along the Hudson River from its owner, the General Motors Corporation, after waiting more than five years for the property to be redeveloped. The village mayor, Philip E. Zegarelli, said today that he was exercising a legal option that had been negotiated with General Motors during the plant's closing in 1996. The option allowed the village to buy the property if not enough progress had been made on the redevelopment. In a letter dated Dec. 3, he formally notified the company and included a check for $120,000 as a down payment on a purchase price of $12 million.
12/12/2001	Investors Wary of Fiat Plan to Issue Bonds	Investors reacted negatively and with some puzzlement yesterday to one component of the restructuring plan announced Monday by Fiat S.p.A., the struggling Italian automaker -- a $2.2 billion convertible bond issue backed by the 32 million shares of General Motors Corporation stock that Fiat holds. The company also announced plant closings, job cuts and the resignation of Roberto Testore as the chief executive of its carmaking division, which had flat sales last year. He will be replaced by Giancarlo Boschetti, head of the company's much faster-growing truck group.
12/12/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Suppliers Cut Off Daewoo	Daewoo Motor closed its three major plants after suppliers suspended shipments while waiting for the financially troubled company to pay its bills. Suppliers say Daewoo Motor owes them $1.2 billion and have suggested that General Motors, which has agreed to take over the company, make the payments. A Daewoo spokesman said the company would run out of cars in a week unless parts arrived. Union members of Daewoo Motor Sales, the subsidiary responsible for selling Daewoo cars in Korea, staged a brief walkout and threatened a strike to protest layoffs and restructuring. Don Kirk (NYT)
12/11/2001	More Hurdles for EchoStar-DirecTV Plan	EchoStar Communications knew it was going to have a tough task getting government approval for its planned $32 billion takeover of DirecTV, a deal that would combine the nation's two largest satellite television systems. Just how hard is now clear. EchoStar's chief executive, Charles Ergen, received a chilly reception last Tuesday in a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee, as legislators scrutinized the merger's competitive impact on rural America. It was only the beginning of a regulatory review process that is expected to take more than nine months.
12/9/2001	How About Reinventing The Cup Holders?	To the Editor: Re '' 'Type B' Chief Guides G.M. on a Course to Revival'' (Nov. 25), which described how Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of the company since June 2000, was quietly changing its culture:
12/5/2001	Honda Opens a U.S. Factory and a Front Against the Big 3	Top executives of Honda Motor criticized the Big Three today for what they view as a double standard on fuel economy. The executives said that domestic manufacturers were not willing to face the environmental implications of becoming increasingly reliant on sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles. ''Business and some social obligation have to be equally applied to the whole company,'' said Koichi Amemiya, chief executive of Honda's American operations, who was in Alabama to open a minivan assembly plant.
12/4/2001	Despite Ills, Automakers Report Solid Sales for November	Auto sales remained strong for much of November but began to slow after Thanksgiving, when the Big Three automakers started to restrict their interest-free financing offers. Still, the nation's auto industry remains on pace for what should be at least the third- or possibly the second-biggest sales year ever. General Motors said yesterday that it would increase first-quarter production by 7 percent to replenish a stock of vehicles diminished by record October sales and a strong November. G.M., the world's largest automaker, also said it would step up production by about 15,000 vehicles this quarter, and it said the increase would have a favorable effect on earnings projections.
11/28/2001	Vehicle Sales Stayed Robust In November	Auto sales have remained surprisingly strong this month easing the recession, economists say, and possibly shortening it, with automakers beginning to announce plans to increase production more than initially expected early next year to rebuild inventories. November's robust sales, after October's record pace, have been driven by a wave of interest-free financing offers from the Big Three, which have been good news for car buyers with good credit and have attracted many others to dealerships. And the incentives, by increasing consumer spending, have brought hopeful tidings to a bleak economy.
11/28/2001	G.M. NAMES EXECUTIVE TO OVERSEE TAKEOVER OF DAEWOO	D. Nick Reilly, General Motors' vice president for European sales, marketing and aftersales, will oversee the transition of Daewoo Motors to G.M. control, beginning on Jan. 1. Once G.M. has completed due diligence and the takeover of Daewoo is final, Mr. Reilly will become president of the new company, G.M. said. Jonathan Browning, the former managing director of Ford Motor's Jaguar Car unit, will succeed Mr. Reilly at G.M. Europe. Don Kirk (NYT)
11/25/2001	'Type B' Chief Guides G.M. On a Course To Revival	EIGHT years ago, addressing an auto industry conference in Traverse City, Mich., Rick Wagoner strode from the lectern to the front of the stage. Mr. Wagoner, now the chief executive of General Motors, had just been named its head of purchasing, replacing Jos Ignacio Lpez de Arriorta, a storied executive who had forced steep price cuts and quality inspections on G.M.'s suppliers and, in the process, become a reviled figure in Motor City. The walk itself was a revolution -- G.M. executives do not leave the lectern. They remain behind it. They read from the script. They stay on point. Instead, Mr. Wagoner proceeded to admit to hundreds of suppliers that the company had not done a good job of explaining its new approach. He did not say he would scrap Mr. Lpez's tough reforms, but he did say G.M., the world's largest automaker, would repair the partnership.
11/23/2001	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; Trucks of the Taliban: Durable, Not Discreet	THEY hanged television sets, and draped trees with videotape pulled in fury from cassettes. Computers were ''executed'' on the spot, with rifle butts to the monitors. The Taliban and technology were enemies from the start, as Afghanistan's former rulers sought to drag the country back across centuries to their own medieval, village-culture form of Islam. But four-wheel-drive trucks? That was something else. From their appearance as a ragtag village militia to their heyday as the puritanical masters of 90 percent of Afghanistan, and through to their helter-skelter flight last week from all but two cities, the Taliban had their own signature vehicles and these seemed at odds with the rulers' theological commitment to a no-tech world.
11/23/2001	Fuel Targets for Sport Utilities Pose Difficulties for Automakers	Top executives of the Big Three automakers pledged anew in recent interviews to improve the fuel economy of their fleets of sport utility vehicles. But some of them are casting doubt on whether the goal set by Ford Motor last year -- a 25 percent improvement by 2005 -- can be met. Ford Motor pledged in the summer of 2000 to improve the fuel economy of its sport utilities by about 5 miles a gallon, from about 20 miles a gallon. That is well beyond federal standards, which have not been toughened significantly in more than a decade and require an automaker's fleet of sport utilities and other light trucks to average 20.7 miles a gallon. After Ford's move, General Motors and Chrysler responded not by specifying numerical goals of their own but rather by promising to match or beat Ford's gains.
11/18/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2001 Chevrolet TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy; G.M. Makes Up Ground With New Midsize Sport Utilities	FROM the moment the first Ford Explorer went on sale, the Chevrolet Blazer and its near-twin, the GMC Jimmy, were left eating its dust. Ford has dominated the market for midrange sport utility vehicles, and General Motors could never catch it. But things are changing. Both Ford and G.M. brought out re-engineered S.U.V.'s this year, and they are more competitive. The Explorer, while improved in many ways over the models that received so much attention for tire failures and rollover deaths, has not exactly caused a stir in the automotive world. Sales are still far ahead of the competition, but reviewers have not showered it with praise. The market that Ford had once largely to itself has become crowded.
11/16/2001	Steering the Driver To Preferred Pit Stops	IN-CAR information services like the OnStar system from General Motors are starting to duplicate some of the Web's most useful offerings: driving directions, stock quotes, customized news and weather reports. Now, some of the companies behind these services are adding advertising and ''mobile commerce'' to the mix. The companies say their subscribers will not be subject to the dashboard equivalent of junk e-mail and annoying pop-up ads. Consumer concerns about privacy, along with the focus on driver distractions prompted by the spread of cellphones, mandate a conservative approach. But the possibilities may be too interesting to ignore.
11/14/2001	Executive Who Promoted Interest-Free Car Loans Is Leaving G.M.	Ronald L. Zarrella, the architect of the General Motors strategy to offer interest-free financing after Sept. 11, resigned from G.M. today to take the top job at his former employer, Bausch & Lomb. Mr. Zarrella was the president of North American operations at G.M., the world's largest automaker.
11/13/2001	Miscellany	Arnold Worldwide, Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas Advertising, laid off another 20 employees, or 3 percent of its staff, in a move related to the economy. General Motors signed an agreement with the William Morris Agency, Beverly Hills, Calif., under which the agency will seek entertainment marketing deals for G. M. in realms including movies, television, music, sponsorships and sports. Terms were not disclosed.
11/13/2001	G.M. Starts to Back Off on Its Price War	General Motors has begun a slow retreat from the auto industry's price war that was spurred by the Sept. 11 attacks. G.M., the nation's largest automaker, said today that it would extend its Keep America Rolling incentive package and continue to offer interest-free financing through Jan. 2. But the new phase of the plan will be less generous than the current one and will not include Cadillacs, Corvettes and some Saturn vehicles.
11/11/2001	'Vette Lament: Postage Is Due	FORD has had three. Now Chevy enthusiasts want a United States postage stamp, too. They are gathering petition signatures for a stamp to mark the Corvette's 50th anniversary in June 2003. There used to be a Postal Service ban on stamps that hinted at commercial promotion, but that faded at the end of the 20th century with the release of 10 sheets of stamps, one for each decade. In highlighting cultural peaks (or valleys, depending on one's view), it was hard to avoid stamps showing Superman and the Slinky.
11/8/2001	Changing of Guard at U.A.W.	Ron Gettelfinger, the union executive who negotiated a spinoff of Ford's auto supply business on exceedingly generous terms for its workers, is expected to be nominated as the next president of the United Automobile Workers on Thursday, several people close to the deliberations said today. But because the selection is made by a secret ballot of 19 top officials, surprises are possible. Mr. Gettelfinger, 57, who is the U.A.W. vice president in charge of relations with Ford Motor, is running against Richard Shoemaker, 62, the vice president who oversees U.A.W. relations with General Motors. Stephen P. Yokich, 66, the U.A.W.'s current president, has passed the union's retirement age of 65 and will depart when his term ends next year.
11/6/2001	EchoStar to Receive Loan	EchoStar Communications said today that Credit Suisse First Boston would provide a $2.75 billion short-term loan to help finance the planned purchase of its satellite-television rival, Hughes Electronics. EchoStar, the owner of the Dish Network satellite service, said Credit Suisse's financing would replace a temporary loan from Hughes's parent, General Motors. EchoStar also lined up a $2.75 billion loan from Deutsche Bank, it said in a statement.
11/5/2001	Market Place; Skepticism about EchoStar's proposed purchase of G.M.'s Hughes abounds among investors.	INVESTORS are deeply skeptical about EchoStar's deal for DirecTV. A week after EchoStar Communications agreed to pay General Motors $26 billion for General Motors' Hughes Electronics unit, which owns the DirecTV satellite television service, the share prices of EchoStar and G.M.'s Hughes are both down sharply. And last week, when the research firm Thomson Financial polled big shareholders at the request of Hughes, one money manager who panned the deal said the Thomson pollster told him he ''was hearing that from everyone.''
11/2/2001	Vehicle Sales for October Were Highest Ever in U.S.	Sales of cars and trucks in the United States soared to the highest monthly level ever in October, automakers reported today, but they were spurred by deep discounts that foreshadow trouble in the months ahead. Despite an economy in recession, rising unemployment and shaken consumer confidence, vehicles sold at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 21.26 million last month, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service in Southfield, Mich. That tops the previous high of 21.24 million, reached in September 1986. Sales for the entire year are expected to finish above 17 million vehicles.
10/30/2001	Ford Chief Is Reported to Resign; Will Be Replaced by Family Heir	The chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, Jacques A. Nasser, has resigned, according to a person close to the company. William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of Ford and the great-grandson of Henry Ford, will take over as chief executive. The move will be announced today.
10/30/2001	Look, Up in the Sky! Big Bets on a Big Deal	As much as Charles W. Ergen, the chairman of EchoStar Communications, had to struggle to persuade the General Motors board to accept his $25.8 billion bid for G.M.'s Hughes Electronics unit, he now faces the even tougher task of selling the deal in Washington. Many industry analysts say the takeover may win relatively easy approval from the Federal Communications Commission and its pro-business chairman. But they say it will probably face a far more strenuous review by the antitrust division of the Justice Department because it would combine the nation's No. 1 satellite television company -- Hughes's DirecTV unit -- with EchoStar, the No. 2 player.
10/30/2001	With Hughes Sale, G.M. Buries a Discarded Strategy	General Motors can no longer be confused with General Electric. G.M.'s planned sale of its Hughes Electronics unit marks the company's final retreat from a strategy of buying technology and engineering prowess in the hopes of bolstering its core car business.
10/30/2001	Trying to Stack the Deck So Even a Loss Is a Win	Before he began selling giant satellite dish systems door-to-door with his wife in 1980, Charles W. Ergen, the chairman of EchoStar Communications, used to play the blackjack tables. To improve his chances, he learned to count the cards the dealer played out, becoming so good that he was even kicked out of a Las Vegas casino. Once again Mr. Ergen has found a way to tilt the odds in his favor. Yesterday, he won his biggest bet of all, beating out Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for EchoStar's sole American rival, DirecTV, with a $25.8 billion offer. At the last minute, he even put $2.75 billion of his own cash on the table.
10/29/2001	G.M. Agrees to Sell Its Satellite TV Unit In $26 Billion Deal	In a deal certain to draw scrutiny from regulators, General Motors agreed last night to sell Hughes Electronics, the owner of DirecTV, to EchoStar Communications for about $26 billion in cash and stock. The sale would combine the nation's two largest satellite television companies, creating a behemoth with 16.7 million subscribers, more than even the biggest United States cable television company.
10/28/2001	Murdoch Ends DirecTV Bid After G.M. Delays Decision	Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation withdrew from talks to acquire the General Motors Corporation's Hughes Electronics division and its DirecTV business, the nation's No. 1 provider of satellite television service, after G.M. postponed a decision on selling the unit last night. With those developments, it appears that Hughes will probably end up in the hands of the EchoStar Communications Corporation, which is the No. 2 satellite television provider under the Dish Network brand.
10/26/2001	G.M. Is Said To Be Near Picking Winner For DirecTV	After 18 months of negotiations, General Motors hopes to decide tomorrow whether to sell its communications satellite business to the News Corporation or the EchoStar Communications Corporation, people close to the talks said yesterday. Yesterday, EchoStar appeared to have the edge in the negotiations, those people said. But the News Corporation is trying to gain an advantage by rallying support in Washington, arguing that an EchoStar deal would raise serious antitrust concerns.
10/19/2001	An Artiste Invades Stodgy G.M.; Detroit Wonders if the 'Ultimate Car Guy' Can Fit In	Robert A. Lutz, stogie lodged in crooked-toothed grin, is explaining how his approach to the car business differs from that of his new employer, General Motors. ''It's more right brain,'' said Mr. Lutz, a veteran of all three big American automakers who was recently named G.M.'s vice chairman for product development. ''It's more creative.''
10/18/2001	G.M. Extending Incentives As Ford Posts Another Loss	General Motors today extended interest-free financing deals on its vehicles through mid-November, escalating a price war with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group that began last month. There were signs today that the rising incentive costs were taking their toll. Ford reported a third-quarter net loss of $692 million, posting a second consecutive quarter of losses for the first time in nearly a decade. The loss was in line with analysts' estimates.
10/18/2001	EchoStar Looks to Add Cash to Bid	Hoping to bolster its effort to acquire the DirecTV satellite television business from General Motors, EchoStar Communications is negotiating $5.5 billion in additional financing for the deal, executives close to the company said yesterday. By adding a significant amount of cash to its previous all-stock offer, EchoStar might be better able to compete with its rival for DirecTV, the News Corporation.
10/17/2001	G.M. TO BUY STAKE IN COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS FUEL CELLS	General Motors will get a stake of as much as 28 percent in the Hydrogenics Corporation as part of an alliance with the company, a maker of fuel cells, to develop low-pollution technology to power cars and trucks. Hydrogenics, which is based in Toronto, develops fuel cells and equipment to test them and has been in business since 1995.
10/16/2001	Debt Downgrade For Ford, G.M.	Standard & Poor's lowered the credit ratings of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company as competition from overseas rivals reduced profit. The Toyota Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and some other Asian automakers have followed the United States companies and have begun offering no-interest loans to encourage sales.
10/11/2001	A Buyer's Market for Autos Is a Tough Development for Chrysler	Dieter Zetsche is holding an arm's length pair of cardboard scissors. The Romeo High School band has played ''The Star Spangled Banner.'' A big American flag is unfurled into a cloudy sky. Veterans salute and a pastor prays. Now it's time for Mr. Zetsche, the chief executive of the Chrysler Group, to cut the big red ribbon stretching over the entrance of Orchard Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, a new dealership nestled next to a Fashion Bug and a Farmer Jack, several miles north of Detroit. For Mr. Zetsche, 48, an affable, slim German with small, rounded glasses perched over a walrus mustache, cutting the ribbon is the easy part.
10/10/2001	Would-Be Raider of Blue-Chip Companies Is the Talk of Wall Street	Ade O. Ogunjobi, a college dropout who describes himself as an entrepreneur, wants to be the next great corporate raider. He may be just a joker. His Los Angeles-based company, Toks Inc., said yesterday that it planned to make tender offers for General Electric; AOL Time Warner; General Motors; the Hughes Electronics unit of G.M.; AT&T; AT&T Wireless; and Marriott International. The offers, which Toks valued at $2 trillion, were quickly declared a hoax by most of the companies. ''We're as mystified as anyone,'' said Toni Simonetti, a spokeswoman for General Motors. ''It seems pretty far out on the edge.''
10/10/2001	35 Years of Muscle Come Screeching to a Halt	THE Web site for Pontiac's Firebird says, ''The muscle car LIVES!'' But it is not quite the truth. The Firebird and its Chevy twin, the Camaro, have suffered from falling sales over the last decade, and General Motors announced last month that the 2002 models would be the last, ending a run of 35 years. In addition, G.M. will shutter the plant that has built these icons of American automotive performance. Technically, of course, the cars are foreign imports, because the plant is in Quebec. But that is of little moment to the legion of Camaro and Firebird fans who consider the coupes and convertibles to be as American as apple pie (to quote one of Chevy's old ad campaigns).
10/10/2001	Worried Carmakers Appeal to Patriotism and Pocketbooks	AS the 2002 model year begins, the timing could hardly be more challenging for automobile manufacturers. Thanks to slow summer sales, an even slower economy and post-Sept. 11 jitters, dealer lots are jammed with last year's cars. While such circumstances usually cry out for aggressive marketing, advertisers are wary of offending the public with pitches that might appear insensitive during a time of mourning and reflection. How does an automaker move cars off the lot in such an atmosphere? For some, the answer is to change nothing and hope for the best. For others, the solution is to mix financial incentives with a healthy dose of patriotism. That is what America's big three carmakers are doing, in addition to continuing all the regular new-model advertising they had planned before Sept. 11.
10/5/2001	Big Loss at Nissan Seems to Undercut U.A.W. Objectives	The United Auto Workers thought that the Nissan workers in Smyrna, Tenn., would be the ones to finally unionize a foreign automaker's plant and provide a crucial first step in turning the U.A.W.'s fortunes around. Instead, the union was dealt a bitter defeat on Wednesday in a battle it had expected to win, or at least closely contest. The margin of defeat has surprised the auto industry and labor unions alike. Nissan employees rejected U.A.W. representation by a 2-to-1 vote, no better than in the union's failed attempt to organize the same plant in 1989.
10/3/2001	Auto Sales Off in September, But Less Than Expected	United States auto sales slumped last month, but were better than analysts expected. A drought in auto sales after the attacks has already led to additional belt-tightening for an industry that was trimming as the economy worsened. Now, analysts say demand will plunge more sharply, leading to more production cuts, plant closings and layoffs.
9/28/2001	Is There Life After G.M. at Daewoo?	A TENTATIVE deal for General Motors to take over major assets of Daewoo Motor of South Korea could bring Daewoo's struggling American operations under G.M.'s wing. Or G.M. could decide that Daewoo, which it pursued partly to gain a foothold in the closed Korean car market, does not belong in the United States at all. It could also take a hands-off approach to Daewoo's marketing and dealer operations -- G.M.'s strategy with Suzuki, a small Japanese automaker of which it owns 20 percent, and Subaru.
9/26/2001	As Muscle S.U.V.'s Overpower Muscle Cars, G.M. to Discontinue Camaro and Firebird	General Motors said yesterday that it would stop making, at least for now, two of its renowned ''muscle cars,'' the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird. In the cars' heyday in 1978, G.M. sold 260,000 Camaros and about 175,000 Firebirds. The Camaro was driven by two Charlie's Angels -- on television and in the movie remake -- and by Darrin on ''Bewitched.'' The Firebird Trans Am was made famous by Burt Reynolds in ''Smokey and the Bandit.'' But by last year, Camaro sales had fallen to 42,000 and Firebird to 31,000.
9/23/2001	Already, a Look That Seems Quasi-Military	VISUAL echoes of war and global tension have often shown up in automobiles. But given the industry's long development process, there has usually been a lag of several years between military events and civilian vehicles. This time, though, it is as if Americans had anticipated the mood of crisis. For years, they have bought sport utilities, with their quasi-military ruggedness, to feel secure. Strategic Vision, a research firm in San Diego, says security is the quality that car buyers value most -- more than ''freedom,'' more than ''esteem.''
9/22/2001	G.M. to Pay $400 Million To Take Control of Daewoo	General Motors formally announced today an agreement with the creditors of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor Company that will give G.M. a brand and a substantial manufacturing foothold in Asia at a bargain price. General Motors will pay $400 million in cash for a controlling interest in a new company to rise from Daewoo Motor's wreckage, including two modern plants in South Korea and two plants overseas. The creditors keep a minority interest. The new company is expected to reach $5 billion in annual revenue.
9/21/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Deal Expected	Executives of General Motors and the government's Korea Development Bank, lead creditor for the bankrupt Daewoo Motors, were to sign a memorandum of understanding today setting the terms for G.M. to gain control of the company. G.M. and its partner, Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, are to take control of two-thirds of Daewoo Motors while assuming none of nearly $17 billion in liabilities. G.M. is to get Daewoo's two best plants in Korea and an option to take over its aging plant in Inchon after buying cars made there for six years. Don Kirk (NYT)
9/20/2001	Detroit, With Its Sales Falling, Is Urged to Help Spur Economy	Two top Bush administration officials made an unscheduled visit to Detroit today to urge the auto industry to do what it can to help stimulate an economy on the brink of recession. Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, and Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of labor, met with top executives of the Big Three automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group -- which had already lost market share this year to foreign manufacturers before the terrorist attacks last week on New York and Washington.
9/18/2001	G.M. Agrees to Buy Part of Daewoo Motor	General Motors has reached an agreement to buy most of the Daewoo Motor Company from Daewoo's creditors for about $1 billion, but leave the most troublesome parts on the creditors' hands, at least for now, people in the industry said. A G.M. spokesman confirmed the outlines of the agreement and said, ''We're making progress, we're optimistic.'' He stopped short of calling the deal final; so far, the deal is in the form of a nonbinding memorandum of understanding.
9/8/2001	END OF OLDSMOBILE PRODUCTION IS SET FOR 2004 MODELS	The General Motors Corporation will end Oldsmobile production with 2004 models, phasing out the unprofitable century-old brand starting with the Intrigue sedan next year. Production will end for the Intrigue and the Aurora sedan with a V-6 engine in 2002, the Aurora with a V-8 in 2003 and the Alero small car, Silhouette minivan and Bravada sport-utility vehicle in 2004, G.M. said in a statement. General Motors said in December that it would phase out Oldsmobile in a few years because the division had failed to turn a profit.
9/5/2001	Detroit's Big Three May Shuffle as Chrysler Struggles	General Motors. Ford. Toyota? The overseas assault on Detroit's Big Three continued yesterday as the Chrysler Group reported that its August sales fell 24 percent from the year-earlier period. That surprised analysts and led some to wonder if the continuing sales gains by Toyota Motor would lead it to become the nation's third-largest automaker, vaulting past Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
9/2/2001	Private Sector; Now You Have It, Now You Don't	Michael A. Grimaldi, a vice president at General Motors, experienced every golfer's dream last weekend: he scored a hole in one. It happened in a charity golf tournament in Lake Orion, Mich. -- on the 18th hole, no less. Even better was the prize for anyone who aced a hole at the event: $1 million. But Mr. Grimaldi, 49, in charge of G.M.'s field sales, service and parts operations, couldn't keep it -- G.M. rules bar executives from collecting cash prizes while representing the company at charity events. The tournament, held at the Indianwood Golf and Country Club, was a fund-raiser for the J. P. McCarthy Foundation, which supports research into myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood disease. G.M. had paid $150,000 to be a tournament sponsor.
9/2/2001	Alfa's Return Is Put on Hold	THE Alfisti are going to have to wait a while longer. Alfisti are lovers of Alfa Romeo cars. They dote on their aging Spiders and GTV's and praise the virtues of the Italian marque on dozens of Web sites, including the ''Alfa Babes'' club for women (http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/alfababes).
8/31/2001	Auto Parts du Jour; Suppliers Are Forced To Learn Flexibility	Long before she receives the latest orders from General Motors and other big customers, Bonnie Sliker has a pretty good idea what they are going to say. Ms. Sliker, general supervisor of the orders and scheduling group at the big Delphi Automotive Systems parts plant in Rochester, makes her own projections by reading trade journals, talking to her contacts throughout the industry and even by watching television news.
8/31/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Talks	General Motors is still negotiating intensely with the creditors of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor but knows nothing about a deadline for reaching an agreement by today, a spokesman for G.M said. ''We haven't got any deadlines from anybody,'' said Rob Leggat, the Asian regional communications official at G.M. South Korea's finance minister, Jin Nyum, said earlier that the talks should wind up by the end of this month or the government would consider other options for Daewoo, where the liabilities exceed $17 billion. Disagreement has reportedly centered on Daewoo's aging plant in the Pupyong district of Inchon, which G.M. has said it does not want in the deal. Don Kirk (NYT)
8/30/2001	Playing With Consumers	EVEN on a modest computer, the revving of the virtual racing car's engine stirs anticipation. The car, low-slung and rendered for speed, glistens under a digitally created sky that is forever high noon. It's the online computer game Dodge Speedway. With the click of a mouse, a player is behind the wheel and joining other racers jostling their way around a skid-scarred track to a throbbing soundtrack of techno music.
8/26/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Volkswagen EuroVan, Chevrolet Avalanche and Pontiac Aztek; Have Tent, Will Travel	ONE of the most magnificent sunrises I've seen was over the Shenandoah Valley, through my car's windshield. I was returning to Syracuse University from spring break in Florida. Having driven virtually nonstop from Daytona Beach, I couldn't go another mile by the time I reached Virginia. I pulled off and caught a few hours' sleep behind the wheel of my 1970 Opel Kadett, then awoke to see the sun peek gloriously over the mountaintops. Sleeping in my car was not my first choice. I was broke. A student on scholarship with college loans mounting, I couldn't afford a hotel room. This was the only way I could spend spring break on the beach.
8/23/2001	The Reality Behind the Slogan; Saturn Unit, Once a Maverick, Is Looking a Lot More Like G.M	General Motors created Saturn 16 years ago as a different kind of car company, a friendly, unconventional brand aimed at Americans for whom Detroit represented a failed past. Today, the slogan remains. But behind the scenes, Saturn is getting to be a lot more like the rest of G.M. And, paradoxically, that is proving a boon for Saturn.
8/22/2001	GENERAL MOTORS AFFIRMS PROFIT OUTLOOK	The General Motors Corporation has affirmed its third-quarter profit outlook and production for the year, four days after the Ford Motor Company lowered its earnings forecast. Third-quarter profit at G.M. will be about 83 cents a share and production is expected to remain at about 1.23 million units, the company said. G.M. is forecast to earn 81 cents a share. Ford said on Friday that it would cut as many as 5,000 salaried jobs and earn about 70 cents a share this year, below the average forecast.
8/20/2001	G.M. Is Said To Continue TV Deal Talks	The chairman of the EchoStar Communications Corporation, Charles W. Ergen, met with executives from General Motors today to discuss his company's bid for the Hughes Electronics unit of G.M., and the two sides agreed to continue talks, executives close to the discussions said. John Devine, G.M.'s chief financial officer, met with Mr. Ergen, the first time a top-level executive at the carmaker has negotiated face to face with an executive of EchoStar, the satellite TV company, these people said. In earlier scuttled talks, G.M. left much of the negotiating to Hughes executives. But as talks foundered between Hughes and a rival bidder, the News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, G.M. took a more active role.
8/19/2001	Commercial Property/Westchester; Sleepy Hollow Awaiting Plans for Ex-G.M. Plant	TODAY, almost five years since General Motors stopped making autos in Sleepy Hollow, the largest buildable parcel in Westchester still looks like just another abandoned manufacturing site along the Hudson River. And although the automaker recently chose the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, N.J., to design and build a mixed-use development on the 97 acres, specific plans for reusing the property are still months away. It could be three more years before the first shovel goes into the ground and six years before the first occupants move in, the developer has said.
8/18/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Debt Talks	The finance minister, Jin Nyum, increased the pressure for a rapid conclusion to negotiations between General Motors and creditors for the bankrupt Daewoo Motor. Mr. Jin said the government could not wait indefinitely, suggesting it would come up with its own solution if the banks fail to reach a deal. On Thursday, Lee Keun Young, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Service, said the government might have to develop a contingency plan for the company. An executive for one of the creditors said there were still many differences and nothing had been settled, according to the semi-official Yonhap News Agency. Don Kirk (NYT)
8/18/2001	FORD TO CURTAIL AUTO PRODUCTION AND CUT 5,000 JOBS	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was eliminating 5,000 salaried jobs in North America and planned to reduce production this fall, the latest signs that the auto industry may no longer be able to prop up the stumbling American economy. The Standard & Poor's credit agency responded to Ford's moves by warning that even more drastic measures were needed. S.& P. said it was preparing to downgrade the credit ratings of both Ford and General Motors -- a reflection of Wall Street's worries about the domestic carmakers' high costs and the growing market share of import brands.
8/17/2001	A Welcome Mat for Gay Customers	AFTER decades of treating gay consumers as the invisible minority they often were, automakers are courting them directly, often with messages that wave the rainbow banner of gay acceptance. This year, Jaguar, Volkswagen and Volvo began advertising in national gay publications, joining three companies -- Saab, Saturn and Subaru -- that had signed on earlier. And the commitment often runs deeper than a few strategic ads. Carmakers are sponsoring gay events, awards and causes.
8/16/2001	Opel Plan Includes 350,000 Fewer Cars	The loss-plagued German subsidiary of General Motors, Adam Opel A.G., unveiled a broad turnaround plan today that called for reducing production by about 15 percent, or as many as 350,000 cars a year. The plan is the first comprehensive strategy laid out by Opel's first German chief executive, Carl-Peter Forster. Mr. Forster, an engineer and former production chief at Bayerische Motoren Werke, was recruited this spring after Opel reported a loss of more than $400 million for 2000.
8/12/2001	Private Sector; A Bull in G.M.'s Shop	From factory floor to polished marble: E. Stanley O'Neal, the newest member of the General Motors board of directors, cannot be called a stuffed shirt who has never gotten his hands dirty. Mr. O'Neal, 49, joined the G.M. board last Tuesday, just two weeks after he was named president and chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch. But his relationship with G.M. spans three decades. In 1969, he attended the cooperative education program at the General Motors Institute, working part-time at the same G.M. plant in Doraville, Ga., where his father had worked. Mr. O'Neal said his most vivid memory was the body shop: ''They had these huge pneumatic bolters, sparks flying everywhere.'' He later worked as an assembly-line supervisor, won a scholarship from G.M. to attend business school at Harvard, received his M.B.A. in 1978 and returned to G.M. as a financial executive. Eight years later he joined Merrill Lynch. Until last week, he had resisted G.M.'s entreaties to join its board. ''From a personal point of view, it is coming back full circle,'' he said. Alex Berenson
8/9/2001	G.M. Official Says Dollar Is Too Strong	John M. Devine, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said today that the strength of the dollar continued to hurt United States manufacturers and that G.M. had asked the Bush administration to rethink its currency policy. ''The strong dollar of the last couple of years is certainly giving a lot of strength to the Germans and to the Japanese,'' Mr. Devine said at an auto industry conference here.
8/8/2001	G.M. Announces Plans for Fuel Cells	General Motors said today that it planned to develop and market fuel cells to heat and power homes and businesses by the middle of the decade to further a technology it expects to supplant the internal combustion engine. But G.M., like other automakers, does not plan to introduce fuel cell vehicles to the public until at least the end of the decade. ''Our commitment is to drive towards significant volume, hundreds of thousands, by the end of the decade,'' Larry Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development, said at a major automotive conference. ''It can change the world,'' he added. ''Automobiles can be reinvented around this technology.''
8/8/2001	EchoStar Makes Headway In Its Effort to Buy Hughes	EchoStar Communications won a partial victory yesterday in its effort to buy Hughes Electronics, the satellite television company that operates DirecTV, when the board of Hughes's parent, General Motors, did not reject the idea outright. At a regularly scheduled meeting, the G.M. board said it would review EchoStar's unsolicited $30 billion offer in detail while still pressing ahead with the final terms of its proposed deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
8/7/2001	EchoStar Bid For Hughes Could Hinge On Antitrust	Forget about the money. True, EchoStar is offering about $30 billion for Hughes Electronics and its DirecTV business. But the price -- a significant premium over a pending offer from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -- is almost beside the point.
8/6/2001	SATELLITE TV RIVAL IN BID FOR HUGHES	EchoStar, the nation's second-largest satellite television company, made a $30.4 billion unsolicited bid yesterday for its larger rival, Hughes Electronics, the owner of DirecTV. The offer is an effort to pre-empt the sale of Hughes to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which has been negotiating to buy the company for months. If EchoStar's bid succeeds, the deal would probably face tough scrutiny from regulators because EchoStar would then control more than 90 percent of satellite television services for the home in the United States. Indeed, Hughes and its parent, General Motors, privately spurned a buyout offer weeks earlier from EchoStar over worries that antitrust officials would block the deal, according to executives involved in the talks.
8/3/2001	G.M.-Daewoo Talks Said to Be Stalled	Negotiations between General Motors and the creditors of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor of South Korea are at a standstill and are in danger of failure, according to people close to the talks. The G.M. team, led by Alan Perriton, the company's top executive in South Korea and Japan, is awaiting a response to its offer, said a G.M. spokesman, as Daewoo officials leak details of the talks to the Korean media.
8/3/2001	G.M. Hires Developer of Some Chrysler Hits	General Motors, often criticized for making cars that lack flair, said today that it had hired Robert A. Lutz, the former president of Chrysler, as vice chairman for product development. The company hopes Mr. Lutz, known for championing distinctive vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Viper and the PT Cruiser, will add some personality to G.M.'s cars and trucks. Mr. Lutz, 69, is a Swiss-born, blunt-spoken former Marine pilot who flies a Soviet-era jet for fun and has an extensive personal garage of collectible cars.
8/2/2001	Domestic Auto Sales Fell 6% in July	Auto sales in the United States fell 6 percent in July as the slowing economy and the continued struggles of domestic automakers dampened sales. The falloff from figures in the month a year earlier comes after a surprisingly strong first half of the year that surpassed expectations.
7/29/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Chevrolet Avalanche; Ride 'em, Urban Cowboy	OUR nose knows when you draw close to this small Great Plains city. Unless you have had the foresight to roll up the windows and set the air-conditioner to ''recirc,'' blocking the outside air, your olfactory senses are treated to the historically accurate aroma of a Wild West cowtown. Dodge City was one of the most famous of these towns, as anyone old enough to associate Matt Dillon with the 60's TV marshal, and not the 80's screen heartthrob, will recall. By 1884, some eight million cattle were herded here by cowpokes whose itchy trigger fingers helped to fill the Boot Hill Cemetery downtown. You can pay your respects by turning off Wyatt Earp Boulevard and making a left onto Gunsmoke Street.
7/25/2001	Getting the Corporate Point Across to Employees	In January, General Motors announced an unorthodox plan: its employees in charge of communicating with employees would no longer report to a G.M. executive but to a New York City consultant who specialized in management-employee relations. G.M.'s so-called integrators -- about 100 employee-communications specialists spread throughout the company -- now report to Gary F. Grates, president of GCI Boxenbaum Grates, part of the GCI Group public relations unit of the Grey Global Group. Mr. Grates, in turn, reports to Steven J. Harris, since 1999 the G.M. vice president for communications.
7/22/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Buick Rendezvous; A Glorified Van or a Grand Slam?	TREND surfing is not what comes to mind when a Buick motors by. The most staid of General Motors' divisions, Buick sells cars, not trucks. It built its reputation on a soft ride, spacious comfort and smooth power -- its buyers traditionally wanted Roadmasters, not Loadmasters -- and it remains one of the very few car purveyors that do not sell any minivans, pickups or sport utility vehicles. But now Buick finds itself in the thick of a hot trend: vehicles that are neither wholly car nor truck. This is the awkwardly labeled crossover segment, a new niche in motordom. Buick's entry is the 2002 Rendezvous, and it joins a few earlier entries in combining carlike handling with trucklike features and the availability of all-wheel drive. Many more competitors will follow.
7/19/2001	Smithsonian Museum Close To Naming a Hall for G.M.	The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History has offered General Motors the right to name a new 20,000-square-foot hall of transportation in exchange for a $10 million gift, museum officials said today. Spencer Crew, the museum's director, emphasized that the Smithsonian had not reached a final agreement with G.M. But he described the pending arrangement as an appropriate and necessary way of updating the museum, which has many exhibition halls that have not been renovated since it opened in 1964.
7/18/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Disney To Supply Content For Cars	The Disney Internet Group said yesterday that it would provide content from ESPN.com, Disney.com and ABCnews.com to automobile stereos through the OnStar system of General Motors. Users of OnStar, which has 1.3 million subscribers, can get information using voice-activation and voice-synthesis technology. The companies said the Web-based information from Disney would be personalized but that only audio would be available. Disney will provide ESPN.com's Sports Center update, the audio track of ''World News Tonight'' and Bill Diehl's Entertainment News and other programming to subscribers. OnStar has been seeking localized services for its Virtual Advisor -- an automated, cellular-based service that has been offered as an option on most G.M. vehicles since the beginning of the year. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
7/18/2001	G.M. Registers 73% Decline In Net Income For Quarter	The General Motors Corporation posted a sharp decline in profits yesterday because of rising competition from Asian carmakers, cooling demand for cars in the United States and disappointing sales in Europe. Including problems with its Isuzu Motors affiliate in Japan, General Motors said net income for the second quarter slid 73 percent from the period a year earlier.
7/15/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Cadillac Escalade; A Mammoth Appetite And Creature Comforts	WHEN the six blind men of Indostan approached the elephant of the Hindu fable, their perceptions were colored by where they stood. Certainly, if you grasped the tail of the beast, you might think you held a rope; the ear could indeed be mistaken for a fan; and the trunk was very like a snake. But each man missed the big picture. In its totality, the elephant, with its versatility and cargo capacity, its voracious appetite and its high center of gravity -- not to mention its natural-hide upholstery -- quite resembled a sport utility vehicle. What, then, is one to make of the 2002 Cadillac Escalade, which may be like the elephant in its bulk and its thirst, but is far more comfortable, quite a lot faster and much more pleasing to the nose? That depends mostly on where you stand -- not in physical relation to it, but on a spectrum of social, political and economic issues.
7/15/2001	Coming Soon, A Truck de Ville	Talks for the sale of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor to General Motors are in the final stage, according to Korea's finance minister, Jin Nyum. Mr. Nyum said that General Motors and its creditors, led by the government-owned Korea Development Bank, were ''trimming each other's offers.'' A spokesman for the bank denied, however, that General Motors had offered $610 million for the best Daewoo facilities while attempting not to have to buy the entire company, including an aging plant in Inchon. The two sides have been negotiating intermittently since early last month. Don Kirk (NYT)
7/13/2001	G.M.-DAEWOO TALKS IN FINAL STAGE, KOREAN OFFICIAL SAYS	IN business, as in politics, the health of a boss cannot be kept secret. But when and how much to disclose is a gray area. Vice President Dick Cheney's surgery last weekend to implant a sophisticated pacemaker and defibrillator device in his chest has raised questions about how such an event would be handled in corporate America Harry J. Pearce, 58, the new chairman of Hughes Electronics, a General Motors subsidiary, has been in a position similar to Mr. Cheney's. Three years ago, when Mr. Pearce was a vice chairman at G.M., he learned that he suffered from leukemia. He says he is now considered cured. He spoke last week about the issue of a boss's health. JONATHAN D. GLATER Q. What would a Fortune 100 company say publicly if a top executive suffered from a heart condition like that of the vice president, and what should be disclosed?
7/8/2001	FIVE QUESTIONS for HARRY J. PEARCE; An Honesty Policy on Executive Illness	* The Advertising Club of Greater Boston was renamed the Boston Idea Group. * John McEnroe, the tennis commentator and player, is being featured in television commercials for the Lincoln line of automobiles sold by the Ford Motor Company, which are scheduled to begin running today. Mr. McEnroe is part of efforts to attract younger buyers to Lincoln. The spots are by the Lincoln agency, the Irvine, Calif., office of Young & Rubicam Advertising, owned by the WPP Group. * The Saturn Corporation, Troy, Mich., part of the General Motors Corporation, will begin introducing a compact sport utility vehicle, VUE, with a promotional campaign in August that will start before the traditional advertising campaign. The promotions include vehicle displays traveling around the country and a Saturn blimp at sporting events. VUE is due out in the fourth quarter.
7/5/2001	Miscellany	Auto sales last month rose 0.3 percent from June last year, the first monthly increase over 2000's record pace. The increase surpassed the expectations of analysts, who continued to be surprised by the strength of auto sales despite the sluggish economy. Foreign automakers, however, are still reaping most of the rewards. Ford Motor and General Motors both reported lower overall sales compared with June of last year, while the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler reported a 1 percent sales increase over June 2000 after months of declines.
7/4/2001	Auto Sales Increased in June, Despite Decreases at Ford and G.M.	A joint venture agreement between General Motors and Russia's biggest car producer, AvtoVAZ, became official at a signing ceremony to celebrate the starting point of the $332 million project. The project was first announced in the winter after years of talks, and is the biggest in the Russian car industry to date. Financed in part by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the venture will begin producing Russian all-terrain vehicles next fall, and is expected to reach an annual production of 75,000 cars by 2003. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)
6/28/2001	G.M. AND RUSSIAN CAR PRODUCER SET TO START VENTURE	The General Motors Corporation will find it ''very difficult'' to make a profit in Europe this year because demand is falling and the company's costs are too high, said Michael Burns, president of General Motors Europe. Returning to profit next year ''is the approach we're taking,'' Mr. Burns said today at the Automotive News World Congress in Prague.
6/22/2001	G.M. Announces a Developer For a Complex at Its Former Plant	Five years after shutting its automotive assembly plant on the Hudson River here, the General Motors Corporation today announced its selection of a development partner for a project that would include housing, shops, office space and a hotel conference center. The developer, Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, N.J., has extensive experience in waterfront development, most notably Port Imperial, a $1.7 billion community spanning two miles in Weehawken and West New York, N.J.
6/22/2001	A DREAM FOR BROTHERS	Joe McDonald and his brother Brian are hoping that history will put them in the company of Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Arthur Ashe and Tiger Woods. ''Maybe one day we could be a part of something great, like they were,'' said Joe McDonald, 33, one of the top bobsled drivers in the United States. ''Maybe we can be the next athletes of color to take our sport to a different level.''
6/20/2001	46 New L.I.R.R. Locomotives Must Go Back for Repairs	All 46 of the new locomotives that pull the Long Island Rail Road's double-decker commuter trains must be sent back to the manufacturer so cracks that have developed in the steel frames supporting their engines can be repaired, railroad officials said today. The railroad said that the cracks -- discovered by its inspectors and disclosed more than a year ago -- posed no immediate safety hazard to riders. And the repairs, it said, would not disrupt service because locomotives would be sent back only two at a time, starting in September.
6/20/2001	Spain Court Refuses to Extradite Man G.M. Says Took Its Secrets	The Spanish High Court yesterday refused to extradite Jos Ignacio Lpez de Arriorta, the Spanish executive accused of misappropriating trade secrets when he left a senior post at General Motors in 1992 to join Volkswagen. The court ruled that the charges against Mr. Lpez were not serious enough to justify handing a Spanish citizen over to the United States. Mr. Lpez, 60, nicknamed Super Lpez for his prowess in cutting costs and streamlining production at G.M., was indicted by a Detroit grand jury in 1999 on charges including fraud and transportation of stolen documents.
6/18/2001	G.M. Will Oppose Efforts To Tighten Fuel Efficiency	General Motors is taking a stand against efforts to raise federal fuel-economy standards. G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said on Friday that the company would oppose not only any move to increase fuel-economy standards for automobiles, but also any effort to tighten the definition under which vehicles are considered light trucks, which qualify for more lenient gas-mileage standards than cars.
6/14/2001	Another G.M. Investment In Fuel Cell Development	General Motors signed a 25-year partnership today to work on hydrogen production, storage and refueling as part of its plan to mass-produce cars that run on fuel cells, which make electric current without combustion. The agreement today, with General Hydrogen, a company whose founder was a fuel cell pioneer, follows G.M.'s announcement on Tuesday that it is investing in Quantum Technologies, a unit of Impco Technologies that makes hydrogen storage systems. More such announcements are coming, company officials said.
6/13/2001	EchoStar and G.M. In Talks on DirecTV	The EchoStar Communications Corporation and the General Motors Corporation said they were in preliminary discussions about a possible merger of EchoStar and Hughes Electronics' DirecTV unit, according to a court filing by the companies. The companies filed a motion for a 60-day stay to a lawsuit EchoStar filed last year in Federal District Court in Denver saying DirecTV had a monopoly. G.M. owns 32 percent of Hughes' tracking stock.
6/12/2001	Hughes Warns of a Slower Rate of New Subscribers for DirecTV	The Hughes Electronics Corporation, the unit of General Motors that owns the satellite broadcasting service DirecTV, warned yesterday that it was adding new subscribers at a considerably slower rate than it had previously forecast. Hughes's chief executive, Jack A. Shaw, attributed the poor performance in part to the amount of attention that the company's top officials have recently paid to sorting out the details of a possible takeover bid by the News Corporation, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch.
6/11/2001	Korean Air Canceling Flights as Strikes Widen	Korean Air said yesterday that it had canceled 80 percent of its flights scheduled tomorrow because most of its pilots plan to join a nationwide strike called by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. South Korea's other major airline, Asiana, was also expected to cancel many flights tomorrow because of a strike by ground crews.
6/10/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Oldsmobile Bravada; Born Under a Bad Sign	LIKE a character in a Greek tragedy whose thread of life was prenatally spun, measured and cut by the three Fates, the new Oldsmobile Bravada was condemned to death even before it was born. The paint was drying on prototypes when General Motors announced in December that it would shut down its Oldsmobile Division. So the redesigned 2002 Bravada is the last all-new Olds, and here's the post-millennium twist: the final product of Olds, which has made cars almost exclusively for most of its 103 years, is a truck.
6/10/2001	A Straight Approach to a New Engine	A BLUE V-8 engine, autographed by dozens of workers, greets you at the doorway of the Flint Engine South plant. It was the last of 45 million small-block V-8's built at this site, in a factory that was razed to make way for Flint South, a clean, quiet, modern plant where General Motors is making the Vortec 4200 that powers the 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada, GMC Envoy and Chevrolet TrailBlazer. The mechanical monument serves as a reminder that this is hallowed ground for legions of enthusiasts who revere the small-block engine, which made its debut in 1955 Chevrolets and whose basic architecture is still being used, after four decades of refinement, in today's Corvettes, Camaros and trucks. It proves that although sheet metal is ephemeral, a great engine can live on and on.
6/8/2001	VW Holders Approve Buyback	Defying protests from dissident investors, including several big institutions, Volkswagen A.G. received overwhelming approval from shareholders for its plan to buy back its stock and shore up its defenses against hostile takeovers. Volkswagen wants to buy back an additional 10 percent of its ordinary shares, on top of the 10 percent that it bought back last fall. The company has said it will use those shares in acquisitions or float them outside Germany.
6/5/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Profit	For the second consecutive month, Daewoo Motor reported that it had made an operating profit of several million dollars. The bankrupt company refused to disclose the profit, but a spokesman said it was slightly higher than the $5.2 million reported for April. The report coincided with the start of talks about a possible acquisition of Daewoo at an undisclosed site outside Korea by General Motors and Daewoo's creditors, led by the government's Korea Development Bank. Don Kirk (NYT)
6/2/2001	Auto Sales Off A Mere 1.2% Last Month	The enduring strength of the auto market has surprised economists every month this year and did so again today, as auto sales fell only 1.2 percent from May of last year, while General Motors unexpectedly posted a small increase in sales. G.M.'s gain appeared to come mainly at the expense of Ford Motor, which suffered a sharp drop in sales, particularly for its Explorer and other sport utilities. George Pipas, Ford's manager of sales analysis, said that tire problems at Ford had not produced any clear effect on sales, and attributed the weakness partly to the generous rebates and other incentives being offered by Ford's rivals.
6/1/2001	World Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Strike Threat	The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said it was organizing a nationwide one-day strike on June 12 to press demands like shorter work hours and a halt to the proposed sale of Daewoo Motor to General Motors. Leaders said they hope workers at 200 companies will walk out. Talks between G.M. and Daewoo's creditors are set to start Monday at a secret location. Don Kirk (NYT)
5/31/2001	Daewoo Workers Vow to Fight	In the center of activity for the South Korean labor movement, the Daewoo Motor plant in Inchon, the news that General Motors had submitted a formal takeover proposal for Daewoo today became a challenge and a rallying cry. ''The main slogan for our whole movement is, 'Stop the sale of Daewoo Motor,' '' said a union activist, as leaders of the union gathered in their headquarters, on the grounds of the plant.
5/30/2001	G.M. to Offer Formal Plan For Takeover Of Daewoo	After six months of sizing up the Daewoo Motor Company's remaining assets, the General Motors Corporation will present a formal proposal today for taking over the company. Terms of the proposal have not been publicly disclosed. But analysts said G.M. was expected to offer $1.5 billion to $2 billion for a controlling stake in the bankrupt company, less than one-third of the $5 billion to $6 billion G.M. is believed to have offered in late 1999.
5/29/2001	G.M. Displays More Efficient Large Engine	With gasoline prices near their highest levels of the last 20 years, General Motors is bringing back an idea it last tried in 1981: an engine that shuts down some of its cylinders when they are not needed, to save fuel. The 8-cylinder engine, which powered a Sierra pickup truck smoothly over the hilly country roads here, 70 miles from Washington, is one of two innovations that G.M. plans to introduce soon, and one of a larger number of ideas that are drawing new interest as the fuel they save becomes more valuable. The engine, which has what G.M. calls ''displacement on demand,'' was on display this week for reporters at the Summit Point Raceway here, along with a hybrid that is completely different from those already on the road, and several ''concept cars.'' G.M. says the pickup engine increases fuel efficiency 8 to 10 percent.
5/27/2001	A Last Lap at Indy Before Olds Hits the Finish Line	AT noon today, a 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada will make history. Assuming that everything goes as planned, it will become the first sport utility vehicle to pace the Indianapolis 500. And the last Oldsmobile. Elaine Irwin-Mellencamp will be at the wheel, the first woman to drive an Indy 500 pace car. Ms. Irwin-Mellencamp is a fashion model and the wife of John Mellencamp, the musician and an Indiana native.
5/26/2001	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Auto Cutbacks	Adam Opel A.G., the German subsidiary of General Motors, announced that it would close its German factories for an additional two weeks beyond the normal two-week vacation break in August. GM Europe, which includes Vauxhall and Saab but is dominated by Opel, lost $257 million last year and another $86 million in the first quarter of this year. Opel has been losing market share to rivals like Volkswagen, but it is also confronted with a steep decline in the German automobile market itself. Edmund L. Andrews (NYT)
5/26/2001	Chief of Hughes Electronics Resigns Amid Merger Debate	Michael T. Smith, the chairman of Hughes Electronics which has been in the midst of one of the most melodramatic corporate auctions in recent memory -- resigned from the company today and is being replaced by an executive from General Motors. Mr. Smith had objected to a takeover of Hughes by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, but talks between the two companies were renewed this month.
5/22/2001	Court Fight in G.M. Spy Case	Jos Igncio Lpez de Arriorta, the once highflying automotive executive accused of stealing secrets from General Motors when he left G.M. to take a senior position at Volkswagen in 1992, told a Spanish court today that he would not return voluntarily to the United States to face charges of industrial espionage because he is not guilty -- and unfit to stand trial besides. ''It's all a lie,'' Mr. Lpez, 60, told the three-judge panel conducting the extradition hearing.
5/18/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Sale Talks	General Motors officials arrived in Seoul yesterday for what may be the final round of talks with the creditors of Daewoo Motors over a takeover of the bankrupt carmaker. Hopes for the deal rose when Daewoo's main parts supplier, Korea Delphi Automotive Systems, ended a month of intermittent strikes and slowdowns yesterday by giving unions a no-layoffs pledge. Daewoo said yesterday that an internal survey found 60 percent of its workers favored a G.M. takeover. Don Kirk (NYT)
5/16/2001	G.M. Offers Deep Discounts on Some of Its Big Moneymakers	Trying to reduce bloated inventories of unsold automobiles, General Motors announced deep discounts today on a wide range of models, especially pickup trucks and full-size sport utility vehicles. The new discounts came just six days after G.M. announced a fairly modest program of incentives and just a day after Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly statistical publication, forecast that May would be the weakest month in more than two years in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of auto sales.
5/7/2001	Dream Prize Draws Closer For Murdoch	As Rupert Murdoch's dream of owning a satellite television system in the United States came a big step closer to reality last week, rival media companies began bracing for Mr. Murdoch to become an even fiercer competitor in the American TV industry. After months of tentative discussions, the board of General Motors agreed on Tuesday to begin negotiating in earnest to sell control of G.M.'s Hughes Electronics division to Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation.
5/6/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Super Duty F-250 and Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD; Reaching Critical Mass in the Civilian Arms Race	AMERICA is the land of the very, very big. Big hair, big malls, big cities, big Las Vegas hotels that look like big cities, big movies starring big ships that sink in a big way. Big is practically a good unto itself, not to be confused with the relativistic notion of ''scale,'' to which some old-fashioned professors of design still cling. If the roads seem smaller, it is only because you are sharing them with a new breed of giants. Heavy-duty pickups -- loosely defined as trucks with gross vehicle weight, or G.V.W., of more than 8,500 pounds, including the vehicle and the maximum cargo load -- account for about a third of the two million full-size pickups bought annually in the United States.
5/3/2001	Ford's 70-Year Itch Could Be Relieved; As G.M. Stumbles, Its Perch at the Top Is Within Reach	The last time Ford Motor was the world's biggest automaker was 1930, when Henry Ford, the founder, was still in charge, the Model A had finally replaced the Model T and Margaret Mitchell was still writing ''Gone With the Wind.'' General Motors -- led by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who organized a half-dozen separate car lines under one corporate umbrella and introduced the concept of the annual model change -- surpassed Ford the following year. It remained the nation's largest company, and at times, the world's largest, through most of the rest of the 20th century.
5/2/2001	G.M. Moves Closer to a Deal With News Corp. on Hughes	The board of General Motors moved closer yesterday to selling its satellite television affiliate, Hughes Electronics, to the News Corporation. For the first time since the drawn-out negotiations began last year, G.M. acknowledged, after a board meeting in Detroit, that it was seriously considering the News Corporation's offer for its satellite business, which operates DirecTV.
5/2/2001	Auto Sales Were Down Last Month	Auto sales fell in April, providing the first important indicator of the economy's condition early in the second quarter and a sign that weakening consumer confidence is beginning to affect spending on high-price products. The auto industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.6 million vehicles, down 10 percent from a year earlier. Sales in April were a little higher than what the auto industry considers to be the long-term demand for new automobiles but below the annual rate of 17.2 million cars and light trucks in the first quarter.
4/19/2001	G.M. Earnings Drop, but Forecasts Remain Positive	General Motors announced this morning that it had earned 87 percent less in the first quarter than it did a year earlier, as its shipments to North American dealerships dropped sharply and the prices of new vehicles eroded. But G.M.'s profits were still nearly twice what Wall Street expected, and its stock jumped even before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. G.M. shares closed at $56.80, up $3.17.
4/18/2001	KOREA: AUTO WOES	The Hyundai Motor Company is denying a report in Automotive News that its partnership with DaimlerChrysler is in jeopardy. A Hyundai spokesman said that talks were continuing on a joint production deal and that DaimlerChrysler had no plans to sell its 10 percent stake in Hyundai. At the Daewoo Motor Company, which creditors are trying to rescue from bankruptcy and sell to General Motors, strikers won the sympathy of South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, who said he was ''ashamed'' of the harsh police conduct in a crackdown on protests plant in Inchon last week in which 45 workers were injured. Don Kirk
4/11/2001	2 Envoys of No Nonsense Show Off a New Vehicle	THEIR big sedans still make the social scene, those Cadillac DeVilles and Lincoln Town Cars idling outside elegant parties. Their very different sport utilities, the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator, are beloved by rappers and young screen idols. But America's leading luxury carmakers are eager to develop new, more consistent design themes as they try to expand their global appeal. The different directions they are taking will be evident at the New York International Auto Show, which opens on April 14 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The MK 9 concept car offers a taste of Lincoln's new look. Its creation was directed by Gerry McGovern, the 44-year-old British designer of the Land Rover Freelander and MG F sports car, who took over Lincoln's design studio in 1999. As a ''halo car'' -- aimed at catching the eye of consumers, who may then buy a plainer model -- the MK 9 hovers like a vision of the future over the conservative Town Car, the imposing Navigator and the subtle, European-influenced LS sedans.
4/6/2001	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Design; What Should Luxury Look Like?	General Motors said yesterday that it was recalling about 6,000 of its 2002 midsize sport utilities because of a faulty suspension part. The company has idled an Ohio plant that makes the vehicles until April 16 to resolve the problem, affecting about 2,500 of the 3,900 workers there. The company has produced about 30,000 of the redesigned Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy and Oldsmobile Bravada sport utilities and is recalling those that had been sold, said a spokesman, Dan Flores. The recall was prompted by a part in the suspension that was not made to specifications, Mr. Flores said. The part came from an outside supplier, which G.M. would not identify. No accidents or injuries have been reported as a result of the problem, Mr. Flores said.
4/6/2001	GENERAL MOTORS RECALLS 6,000 MIDSIZE SPORT UTILITIES	As the standoff over a midair collision between United States and Chinese military planes enters its sixth day, American businesspeople here are repeating like a mantra, ''It's business as usual.'' But while Motorola, Procter & Gamble and other companies insist that the dispute need not damage commercial ties with China, a few are starting to acknowledge that it is far from business as usual.
4/6/2001	Standoff Worries U.S. Companies in China	Automakers continued to sell a surprising number of cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in March, despite a slowing economy and falling stock markets. But these sales did not come cheap, as manufacturers extended rebates and other discounts to models that seldom carried them last year. The auto industry sold family vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 17.1 million vehicles, according to sales figures released by all the major automakers today. That was well above the rate of 16 million vehicles that the industry regards as strong, although the number of vehicles sold was still 4 percent lower than the extraordinary number a year earlier.
4/4/2001	Rebates Help Vehicle Sales Remain Strong	Every other Thursday after work, rather than go home to her family in Plano, Tex., Dannellia Gladden-Green drives to the Omni hotel in Richardson, seven miles away, and cracks the books for her M.B.A. course the next day. Much of the discussion in the classroom, she knows, will focus on the activities of a single company, Texas Instruments, which happens to be her employer. That is because Texas Instruments worked with the University of Texas to create a special M.B.A. curriculum for its up-and-coming managers.
4/4/2001	M.B.A. Programs That Look a Lot Like Work	The woman who has led Saturn for the last two years is trading in her car for a boat. Cynthia M. Trudell stepped down today as chairman and president of the Saturn division of General Motors to become the president of the much smaller Sea Ray boat-building group of the Brunswick Corporation.
3/30/2001	Head of G.M.'s Saturn Quits to Build Boats	The Dana Corporation, a leading maker of light-truck axles, said yesterday that it would build a factory in Longview, Tex., to make frames and other structural parts for an undisclosed General Motors vehicle. About 450 workers will be hired for the 211,000-square-foot plant, which is expected to be completed in March 2002, said a company spokesman, Jeff Cole. The cost was not disclosed. The factory will supply a General Motors plant in nearby Shreveport, La., that makes pickup trucks. The company, based in Toledo, Ohio, has about 300 plants and other facilities and employs more than 75,000 people. Dana had sales last year of $12.3 billion.
3/30/2001	DANA IS BUILDING A TEXAS PLANT TO SUPPLY G.M. PARTS	Jeffrey Jones, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, called on the committee of creditors running the bankrupt Daewoo Motor to simply hand General Motors the keys. ''The value is declining every day,'' he said. ''We would be better off having someone take over that company, even if it means giving it away,'' because resolving its fate would bolster confidence. A spokesman for Pohang Iron and Steel denied reports that his company was considering a takeover of Daewoo if G.M. failed to bid for it. Don Kirk
3/20/2001	Daewoo Plans to Cut 6,500 Jobs	Daewoo Motor, the bankrupt carmaker struggling to stabilize its finances, said today that it would eliminate 6,500 jobs, or one-seventh of the work force, at a string of overseas subsidiaries that it spent $5 billion to acquire in the 1990's. Plants in India and Poland may become independent through debt-for-equity swaps, the company said. The moves came amid mounting doubts that General Motors, the main hope for the company's long-term salvation, would buy the company.
3/19/2001	General Motors May Be Running Into Problems in Sale of Hughes Electronics	The uncertainty in the stock market and the growing friction between the head of Hughes Electronics, Michael Smith, and General Motors management is making it tougher for General Motors to sell Hughes, say executives close to the discussions. G.M. needs cash and has been eager to unload Hughes, whose shares trade as a G.M. tracking stock and which owns the satellite television company DirecTV. But in last week alone, Hughes's share price has fallen 16 percent, to close on Friday at $19. On Thursday alone, it fell 7 percent, as rumors swirled that the News Corporation, which has become frustrated in its attempt to pull off a merger with DirecTV, was close to a deal with a rival satellite company, Echostar.
3/9/2001	DEADLINE FOR DAEWOO BID	South Korea's commerce and industry minister said that General Motors had until the end of April to decide if it wanted to buy the Daewoo Motor Company. If G.M. fails to make an offer by then, the minister, Shin Kook Hwan, said, the company's creditors would seek another solution in a merger with another Korean or foreign manufacturer. The company, bankrupt with debts of more than $10 billion, sought to make itself attractive to potential buyers last month by dismissing 1,750 workers from a plant, setting off protests that appeared to have faded yesterday. Don Kirk (NYT)
3/3/2001	G.M. and Ford Losing Out in the European Market	For months now, attention in the automobile industry has been riveted on the implosion of DaimlerChrysler, which announced a three-year plan on Monday to reverse the huge losses at Chrysler in the United States. But as car executives gathered here this week for Geneva's international car show, there was little room for gloating at either General Motors or Ford Motor. Here in Europe, both G.M. and Ford are losing money and market share, and both are struggling to remake their dowdy images.
3/3/2001	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article and a picture caption in World Business on Wednesday about a venture to build sport utility vehicles in Russia misstated the title of a General Motors executive, Rick Wagoner Jr. He is president and chief executive, not chairman.
3/2/2001	Vehicle Sales Held Strong Last Month	American consumers continued to flock to car dealerships in February despite the economic slowdown, producing another unexpectedly strong month for auto sales. Sales fell 6 percent last month from February 2000, but the year-earlier month had been one of the best in the industry's history because of lavish incentives. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.5 million vehicles, in an industry that considers anything above 16 million vehicles to be an excellent month.
2/28/2001	Now That We're Still Here, Where Do We Go? 7 Answers	HUNDREDS of millions of people surf the Web, hundreds of billions of dollars of stock market value have come and gone, and yet the burning questions posed by the Internet have cycled back to the same ones asked five years ago, when people first started to size up the Internet. Can anyone make money with this? Will it be a viable medium for advertising? For shopping? Where is this all going, anyway?
2/28/2001	G.M. in Partnership to Make Cars in Russia	After four years of talks, General Motors has struck an agreement to manufacture automobiles in Russia. Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, announced the venture today at the auto show in Geneva.
2/24/2001	General Motors Sues California Over Quota for Electric Car Sales	The General Motors Corporation filed suit today seeking to invalidate a new California rule that would require automobile manufacturers to sell thousands of electric cars in the state each year starting in 2003. The company contends that the rule violates the state laws requiring regulations to be reasonable and prudent. General Motors, and the automobile industry in general, say that battery-powered cars are impractical and that the rule will bring about a minuscule reduction in air pollution at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.
2/23/2001	Bridgestone Results Hurt by Firestone Recall	The Bridgestone Corporation said today that its fiscal year profit tumbled 80 percent as a result of its sweeping recall of Firestone tires in the United States. Bridgestone is still struggling to recover from the damage caused by the Aug. 9 recall of Firestone tires, which have been linked to 174 traffic deaths.
2/22/2001	GENERAL MOTORS PLANS TEMPORARY CLOSINGS OF PLANTS	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it planned intermittent closings of 14 plants through mid-June. The temporary closings will affect almost half of the automaker's 29 plants in North America. G.M. said it also planned to slow assembly at four plants. G.M. and other automakers have been idling factories and laying off workers to reduce inventories as demand drops after record sales in 2000. The 14 factories are being idled for one to five weeks.
2/21/2001	Daewoo Motor's Fate Tied to Labor Strife	A day after the riot police dislodged hundreds of striking workers at a Daewoo Motor plant in Inchon, questions remained today about whether General Motors would now come to the rescue. Shin Kook Hwan, minister of commerce, industry and energy, said, ''We will jump-start the talks with G.M.'' as soon as possible ''since the obstacles have been removed.''
2/20/2001	Detroit's Answer to 'Hybrid' Cars; Cheaper Than Japan Models, But Far Less Fuel Efficient	Japanese automakers have led the way in selling ''hybrid'' cars, which have improved fuel economy and reduced tailpipe emissions by running on either gasoline or electricity. But the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, on the American market for a year, are costly to produce and sold in limited numbers at a loss. So Detroit is trying a middle ground. American automakers will offer some ''full hybrids,'' capable of running on battery power alone at low speeds, but are putting their main focus on electrically assisted gasoline engines. Such engines, which cost little more than conventional engines but use a less ambitious technology than some environmentalists want, will become an option or standard equipment on dozens of models in coming years.
2/19/2001	Workers Seize Big Daewoo Car Plant in South Korean Port	Hundreds of workers at the Daewoo Motor Company seized the company's huge manufacturing plant here today, pledging to hold it until the financially troubled company gives up plans to lay off more than a third of its work force and reinstates those already dismissed. ''We will keep on striking until the government abolishes the layoff plan,'' Kim Il Sop, the president of the union representing the workers, said in an interview at union headquarters inside the factory. ''We have gathered the workers in small groups throughout the plant to fight the police.''
2/18/2001	The Road to a Roadster	Inside the General Motors advanced design studios in Warren, Mich. -- past the security guards, past the sign reading ''no cameras or image-capturing devices,'' through two sets of locked doors -- designers sketch cars on computers and race them in three-dimensional form, silent as phantoms, around the room. But the studios still have an earthy, elementary-school smell: wet clay, that primitive image-capturing device. It is a reminder that for all the lasers and digital power, something artistic and intuitive, even atavistic, happens there. One brisk gray day last spring, five clay models of cars sat on worktables in one of the studios. Each model was done to one-third scale. Some had skins of silver plastic to simulate steel, while others, still being sculptured, looked like artfully nibbled blocks of milk chocolate. Only on second glance did I notice that each model was of only half a car, in profile: they were pressed against mirrors to give the illusion of a full vehicle.
2/18/2001	From Flower Children to Hulks	The Volkswagen New Beetle was designed and marketed to evoke memories of flower children. The hulking Hummer sport utility vehicle is basically a Persian Gulf war Humvee. What do they have in common? Well, General Motors, which bought the Hummer brand a year ago, has hired Elisabeth Vanzura, 36, the former director of advertising and marketing at Volkswagen of America and the woman responsible for the quirky award-winning ads that helped to revive Volkswagen's quirky counterculture image. (Remember the two drifters humming the German tune ''Da Da Da'' in the Volkswagen Golf ad? It started a nationwide craze.) Ms. Vanzura's task is to help G.M. turn Hummer, the automaker's first new division since Saturn, into a mass-market brand like BMW, increasing sales from 1,000 a year to more than 100,000. Ms. Vanzura says selling New Beetles is not that different than selling Hummers, because ''they're both very hip, very cool, edgy brands that are not for everyone.'' But a New Beetle slogan may have oddly foreshadowed Ms. Vanzura's move: ''Less flower, more power.'' Keith Bradsher
2/17/2001	Big Job Cut at Daewoo Motor Prompts Protests by Workers	The Daewoo Motor Company sent dismissal notices to 1,750 employees today, beginning a long-threatened downsizing. Several hundred workers responded by protesting outside a major Daewoo plant in Pupyong, 20 miles west of Seoul, as their families cheered them.
2/11/2001	A Plan For 97 Riverfront Acres	AFTER General Motors shut down its minivan assembly plant here in 1996 and leveled 97 acres on the Hudson River, developers and dreamers began floating plans: a gambling casino, a golf course, a virtual reality theme park, a film sound stage, a Donald Trump high-rise. The company has not yet said what it plans to build on the site, one of the largest undeveloped parcels on the Hudson. But that has not stopped the mayor and other village officials from putting forward their own ideas. For the past year, they have been discussing a conceptual plan for the property with Scenic Hudson, an environmental group based in Poughkeepsie.
2/7/2001	Hughes Nears Deal to Create Giant Satellite TV Network	The Hughes Electronics Corporation, the satellite television unit of General Motors that owns DirecTV, has moved closer to reaching a deal with the News Corporation that would create a global satellite network worth as much as $70 billion, according to executives close to the negotiations. Hughes has been talking with News Corporation for months over how to structure a deal that would combine the satellite television operations of the two companies and create additional value for G.M. shareholders. G.M.'s board met yesterday and was briefed on the current state of the negotiations and the outline of how the transaction would take place, the executives said.
2/4/2001	For an Olds Family, the End of the Road	To the Editor: As the owner of a 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass, I really enjoyed ''In Rearview Mirror, a Wistful Gaze at the Olds'' (front page, Jan. 28). My family is still buffing ours to keep it presentable. We are lovers of old cars and appreciate both the humor and aggravation people feel when another oldie is discontinued.
2/4/2001	For an Olds Family, the End of the Road	To the Editor: Re ''In Rearview Mirror, a Wistful Gaze at the Olds'' (front page, Jan. 28):
2/2/2001	2 Bets, but Just 1 Payoff	ONE vehicle has a ground-breaking design rooted in the past. The other blazed a trail into what its designers saw as the future. Both are vanlike cars (or carlike vans) with a bit of S.U.V. attitude, and both are built in Mexico. Both were gambles, expected to appeal to the young drivers that automakers covet. And now, after months on the market, both are having problems -- of a very different sort. The Chrysler PT Cruiser, with styling reminiscent of Ford hot rods from the 1930's, has been a huge hit. But with strong demand and limited production capacity, PT's are in short supply, and many buyers complain that dealers are still demanding hundreds or thousands of dollars over the sticker price. DaimlerChrysler, eager to take advantage of its single hot product but trying to cope with a wrenching reorganization, must decide whether to spend precious cash to expand the PT Cruiser factory.
1/28/2001	In Rearview Mirror, a Wistful Gaze at the Olds	A man might leer at a Lincoln or covet a Cadillac, people used to say, but he married an Oldsmobile. Powered by a solid V-8 engine and dressed up in just enough chrome to look prosperous, the Oldsmobile was a softly rumbling chunk of American steel, a roomy car with less flash than a Cadillac but more prestige than a Chevrolet or a Ford. It was a deacon's car, a shift boss's car, and for as long as even the oldest Americans can remember, it rolled with respectability to the Little League ballpark or the Masonic lodge.
1/24/2001	Shopping Perks Up, Defying Worries of a Slowing Economy	After the slowest holiday shopping season in a decade, Americans seem to have cautiously reopened their wallets in the early weeks of 2001, spending more than either executives or analysts had predicted. General Motors said last week that its January sales were unexpectedly strong, and DaimlerChrysler has canceled plans to shut two plants temporarily this month, citing consumer demand. After falling rapidly in December, mortgage applications for home purchases have bounced back and are again near their record high, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. Spending in restaurants and for compact discs and videos has grown more this month than it did in December, based on Visa USA's tracking of credit card sales.
1/19/2001	G.M. SAYS IT WILL CLOSE THREE MORE FACTORIES FOR A WEEK	General Motors said yesterday that it would idle three of its 29 North American factories and furlough 2,450 workers next week to reduce production because of slack demand. Plants in Oklahoma City; Orion Township, Mich.; and Oshawa, Ontario, will be affected. Three other plants were idle this week. The temporary closings are part of G.M.'s plan to reduce first-quarter production by 21 percent from levels of a year earlier, to 1.2 million vehicles. The company said it expected its profits in the first quarter to be marginal.
1/18/2001	G.M. Earnings Dropped 92% In 4th Quarter	General Motors announced today that its profit plunged 92 percent in the fourth quarter because of large one-time charges, a slight erosion of profits in North America and heavy losses overseas, especially in Europe. G.M. had earned $30 million in Europe in the fourth quarter of 1999, but that turned into a $463 million loss during the fourth quarter of last year, even excluding one-time charges. G.M. fared particularly badly in Germany, where its market share dropped even as the overall market shrank and where G.M.'s remaining sales shifted toward smaller, less profitable cars.
1/17/2001	PICKUP TRUCKS FOR CHINA	The Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation said it would develop a pickup truck for sale in rural China with technical help from the General Motors Corporation. A plant in Jiangsu Province in eastern China will be retooled to build an inexpensive four-seat pickup based on the Opel Combo, sold by G.M. in Europe. Shanghai Automotive already produces sedans in joint ventures with G.M. and Volkswagen in Shanghai. Chinese automakers sold 197,059 light trucks domestically in the first half of 2000, up 7 percent from the corresponding period in 1999, according to government figures. Craig S. Smith(NYT)
1/13/2001	'What Sales Slump?' Foreign Makers Ask	For the Nissan Motor Company, it seems like a poor time to be thinking about expanding in the United States. Its troubles at home in Japan are forcing it to close five factories there. Meanwhile, auto sales are slowing sharply here. Yet Nissan has just begun work on a new factory in Mississippi to make full-size pickup trucks for the American market.
1/13/2001	DAEWOO DECISION EXPECTED SOON	South Korea's finance minister, Jin Nyum, said the General Motors Corporation would probably decide whether to buy the bankrupt Daewoo Motor Company by the end of February, with the decision hinging on Daewoo's settling labor disputes and coping with the insolvency of some parts suppliers. Talks to sell Daewoo to G.M. and Fiat S.p.A. have run for five months with little progress, while Daewoo's problems with lenders, unions and suppliers have all worsened. The Ford Motor Company dropped a $7 billion bid for Daewoo in September.
1/10/2001	U.S. Issues Vehicle Ratings On Tendency to Roll Over	The Transportation Department today issued its first ratings of the resistance of vehicles to rolling over, a type of accident that kills more than 10,000 people every year and more than 60 percent of the people who die in sport utility vehicles. The ranking, based on a simple formula relating the vehicle's tread width to the height of its center of gravity, showed that cars are generally less likely to roll over and that sport utility vehicles are most likely to do so, with the Honda Motor Company's Accord sedan at the top and two General Motors sport utility vehicles at the bottom. But it also showed considerable variation within vehicle classes. Among 2001 model sport utility vehicles, one Chevrolet Blazer model rated one star, meaning a rollover risk of more than 40 percent in a single-vehicle crash. The best vehicles in that class scored three stars, meaning a 20 percent to 30 percent risk.
1/9/2001	GENERAL MOTORS AGAIN CUTS PRODUCTION PLANS	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would build 100,000 fewer cars and trucks in the first quarter in North America than it had planned last month, to try to reduce dealer inventories as sales slow. General Motors said it would produce 1.2 million vehicles, down 21 percent from last year's first-quarter output of 1.521 million. G.M. plans to produce 562,000 cars and 638,000 trucks, said a spokesman, Tom Wickham. General Motors and other large automakers in the United States have been reducing production because of weaker demand. Last week, the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler said it would build 26 percent fewer vehicles in the first quarter than in the year-earlier period. The Ford Motor Company plans to build 17 percent fewer cars and trucks in the quarter. General Motors shares fell $1.44, to $52.56.
1/9/2001	Changing Cars in Midstream	Look no more for Chevrolets in the tents at Bryant Park. Seventh on Sixth, the coordinator of New York's semiannual fashion shows, announced last week that Mercedes-Benz would become the sponsor, replacing General Motors after seven years. G.M. spent $1 million to $1.5 million a season to lend its name to the shows, fashion insiders say. Beginning with the fall men's and women's collections, which will run Feb. 8 to 16, what was General Motors Fashion Week will be known as Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. Mercedes-Benz, which would not disclose the size of its investment, has reason to believe that sponsorship will pay dividends. For years, the car maker has been the lead sponsor of Australia's Fashion Week, and sales of C-Class cars and convertibles have increased there among women, said Jeff Fisher, general manager of corporate communications for Mercedes-Benz in the United States.
1/6/2001	AUTOMAKER DESIGNATES CORPORATE MARKETING CHIEF	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest automaker, yesterday named Christopher J. Fraleigh, vice president at PepsiCo Inc., its new head of corporate marketing and advertising . Mr. Fraleigh had been vice president for marketing of colas for the soft-drink and snacks company, a G.M. spokeswoman, Peg Holmes, said. He will start his new job on Monday. Mr. Fraleigh, 37, succeeds Philip Guarascio, who retired in May, and will oversee marketing, planning and media buying for G.M., Ms. Holmes said. He reports to John Middlebrook, vice president and general manager for vehicle-brand marketing and corporate advertising.
1/4/2001	Vehicle Sales Fell Sharply In December	Auto sales slowed precipitously last month, with domestic automakers reporting plunges of up to 18 percent from year-ago levels. Foreign automakers, though, escaped almost unscathed and gained market share. Ward's Automotive, an industry data service, calculated that overall sales fell 7.6 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million cars and light trucks.
1/3/2001	FORD WILL INCLUDE TIRES IN WARRANTY COVERAGE	The Ford Motor Company, whose sales were hurt by a recall of 6.5 million Bridgestone/Firestone tires in August, said yesterday that it would include tires in its warranty coverage on 2001 model cars and light trucks in North America. The move ends a century-old arrangement under which tire makers took responsibility for tire warranties. General Motors began covering tires under its warranties in 1996.
1/3/2001	BRIDGESTONE RECALLS SMALL BATCH OF SPORT UTILITY TIRES	The Bridgestone Corporation, whose Bridgestone/Firestone unit has been plagued by failures and recalls of millions of tires for sport utility vehicles, said yesterday that it had voluntarily begun a recall of yet another small batch of similar tires. The company is calling back about 8,000 P265/70R16 Wilderness LE tires made at its Cuernavaca, Mexico, plant during the week of April 23, because about 150 of them might have the wrong kind of rubber in and around one of their steel belts, making it possible that the tire would come apart at that point. The tires were installed on GMC Yukon XL 1500 and Chevrolet Suburban 1500 vehicles built in Mexico.
12/31/2000	Should Auld Conveyances Be Forgot?	WELCOME to the new century. Say hello to the next millennium. You may have thought the planet crossed those thresholds last year, what with all the round-the-world ''millennium'' celebrations: the crowning of the Great Pyramid of Cheops with a golden cap, the illuminating of the Eiffel Tower in a shower of fireworks, the drinking of glog and petting of reindeer in Swedish Lapland. (In Lapland, they work with what they have.)
12/29/2000	Another 2000 Record: The Most Recalls Yet	CAR buyers want more: more safety technology, more horsepower, more cup holders. What they don't want are more recall notices. But consumers are getting plenty anyway -- a record 21 million vehicles were the subject of safety-related recalls this year. But that may actually be a positive development, since each recall indicates an attempt to fix some sort of safety defect.
12/22/2000	Sharp Production Cutbacks Are Announced by Ford	Joining its crosstown rivals in responding to a rapid deterioration in the auto market, the Ford Motor Company announced sharp production cutbacks today -- including the closing of 13 of its 18 North American factories during the third week of January -- and lowered its forecast of fourth-quarter earnings for the second time in three weeks. The General Motors Corporation said separately today that 6 of its 25 North American assembly plants would be closed in the first week of January. Together with recent cutbacks in output at DaimlerChrysler, the moves by Ford and G.M. were the clearest signs yet that the auto industry, still the mainstay of the economy in the Great Lakes states, has slowed precipitously after nearly seven years of very strong sales.
12/19/2000	G.M. TO PARE BACK VEHICLE LINES TO REDUCE ITS COSTS	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it planned to eliminate one-fifth of its car and light-truck models by 2004 to further reduce costs, after announcing last week that it would phase out the Oldsmobile brand and about 15,000 jobs. One of the three G.M. minivans will be among those eliminated, a spokeswoman said. The plan will reduce G.M.'s line to 63 to 67 vehicles; a decade ago the company offered 115.
12/17/2000	Four-Wheeled Wallflowers, Waiting for a Dance	GENERAL MOTORS' decision to pull the plug on Oldsmobile, announced last week, is sad for many reasons. Olds, dating from 1897, is the oldest surviving American auto producer. Its grand engineering tradition brought innovations like the Hydra-Matic transmission, the overhead-valve Rocket V-8 and the front-wheel-drive Toronado. As recently as 1987, it was No. 3 in sales, trailing only Chevrolet and Ford -- but this year, sales of Olds cars fell behind even those of Saturn, the upstart youngster in the G.M. family. And there is another paradox in the Olds obituary: Its product lineup has never been better.
12/13/2000	BUICKS GO ON SALE IN CHINA	General Motors' joint venture with the Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation began selling the Buick Sail, a version of the Opel Corsa made in Brazil, in China for $12,000 to $15,000, for delivery early next year. On Friday, the first Blazer sport utility vehicles will roll off an assembly line in Shenyang. But sales of the company's Shanghai-built sedans and minivans have been slow, and will total only 30,000 this year, less than a third of the plant's capacity. Craig S. Smith (NYT)
12/13/2000	A Storied Nameplate Relegated to the Museum	If anyone might be expected to mourn the impending demise of the General Motors Oldsmobile division, it would be Peter Berusch, who not only owns 13 Olds cars, mostly convertibles, but also restores pre-1973 models at his shop in Lawrenceville, Ga. Still, the announcement left him unmoved. ''I'm not getting teary-eyed,'' said Mr. Berusch, who heads the Dixie Olds Club, a chapter of the Oldsmobile Club of America. ''The idea that they were going to cut the nameplate has been grinding through the rumor mill for a year and a half. Oldsmobile hasn't really had an identity for the last 15 to 20 years. These days, G.M. just produces the same car with different names.''
12/13/2000	A Rocket backfires on Madison Avenue with the Oldsmobile news.	MADISON AVENUE was startled yesterday to hear a decision by the General Motors Corporation to begin phasing out its Oldsmobile brand in one to three years. The demise of Oldsmobile, which will take place after all current models end their scheduled production runs, was unexpected for two reasons. It not only means the end of a popular and venerable brand, dating to 1897, but also dashes an important review that the Oldsmobile division started in October.
12/13/2000	G.M. Phaseout of Olds Is at Center of a Range of Cutbacks	General Motors said today that it would gradually shut down its Oldsmobile division over the next several years, ending production of cars that symbolized sophistication and affluence through most of the 20th century, but came to be seen as simply dowdy. Stuck with its largest supply of unsold cars since the 1991 recession in an auto market that has slowed significantly, G.M. also announced that it would eliminate 10 percent of its 66,000 salaried jobs and 11,000 contract positions in the United States and Europe. The company said it would close a 2,000-employee assembly plant in Britain.
12/12/2000	Ford Issues Recall Over Speed Controls	The Ford Motor Company announced today the recall of 110,633 Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles because a poorly programmed computer chip in the engines fails to limit the vehicles' top speed. The automaker also said that the vehicles' top speed is higher than previously disclosed even when the chip is working. The announcement is of interest because of controversy this autumn over whether Ford had allowed an adequate safety margin in choosing tires for the Explorer and Mountaineer. Ford said earlier this autumn that a computer chip limited the maximum speed of the Explorer to 99 miles per hour. The Explorer's Firestone tires, which are now being recalled, are certified to last for only 10 minutes at a speed of 106 miles an hour.
12/8/2000	2 Automakers Act on Weakening Sales	General Motors announced a big slowdown in factory production today while Chrysler asked its suppliers to cut their prices by 5 percent on Jan. 1, further signs that Detroit is struggling with an abrupt weakening of auto sales and ballooning inventories of unsold cars. G.M. said that it would produce 14.5 percent fewer vehicles in the next three months than it did in the first quarter of this year. Ford announced last Friday that its output would be down 10 percent in the next three months. And while Chrysler has not yet disclosed its first-quarter production plans, it is also expected to make many fewer cars in January, February and March by eliminating overtime and by not operating some factories at all for a week or two at a time.
12/8/2000	DAEWOO OVERSEAS OPTIONS	Daewoo Motor is considering selling some overseas assets to its South Korean rival, Hyundai Motor, if General Motors chooses not to acquire them, according to Lee Jong Dae, chairman of Daewoo. Creditors of Daewoo, whose application for bankruptcy protection was approved last week, have been talking with G.M. and Fiat about an acquisition of the entire company, but Mr. Lee said the creditors and the company would consider other approaches if G.M. and Fiat walked away from takeover talks, as Ford Motor did in September.

12/6/2000	Army Suspends Vehicle Award After a Protest	The Army today suspended a contract it signed with great fanfare last month to build a new family of light armored vehicles after a company that lost the bid filed a formal protest of the contract award. The Army's move, which was required under the government's procurement laws, dealt another setback to what Army leaders call their ''transformation'' to a lighter, more agile force, raising the prospect of new delays in fielding the first of six new combat brigades.
12/5/2000	G.M. SAYS IT WILL NOT COMPLETE HUGHES DEAL THIS YEAR	General Motors said it would not complete a transaction involving its Hughes Electronics subsidiary before the end of this year. GM said that it was making progress on a possible sale or spinoff and that there were several interested parties with different ideas of what to do with the unit, which owns the DirecTV satellite-television service, among other businesses. G.M. owns 100 percent of Hughes's assets and 32 percent of its tracking stock, which trades separately from ordinary G.M. shares. G.M. shares, which have fallen 29 percent this year, rose $1.25, to $51.56. The Hughes tracking stock, which rose 79 cents, to $22.99, has declined 28 percent this year.
12/2/2000	Automakers Are Facing a Sales Slowdown	Through most of the 1990's, automakers avoided building new assembly plants, convinced that the good times would not last. They have finally committed themselves in the last two years to a string of new factories, only to find their timing is as poor as ever: sales have begun to slow, particularly for Detroit's manufacturers. The combined sales of Detroit-based automakers fell 3.5 percent last month, compared with November of last year. While sales are still at a level that would have been considered very strong until the last two years, they have now lagged last year's pace in six of the last seven months -- and much more production capacity is becoming available.
12/1/2000	More S.U.V.'s (in the Unlikely Event of a Shortage)	As the 2001 model year began, Americans looking for an S.U.V. could choose among 60 distinct models (available in dozens of further permutations). The crowd is still growing, with sport utilities or pseudo-S.U.V.'s on the way from Buick, Porsche, Volkswagen and others. This week, General Motors' Saturn division announced that its first utility vehicle, to go on sale next fall, will be called the VUE. It will have dent-resistent plastic body panels on a cagelike ''space frame.'' The VUE (pronounced view) will be the first S.U.V. with an efficient continuously variable transmission.
11/28/2000	LABOR PACT AT DAEWOO	Workers at the Daewoo Motor Company voted to accept layoffs in a restructuring plan, clearing the way for a South Korean court to put the company into receivership rather than liquidate it. Union opposition to layoffs was cited as a main reason creditors forced the company into bankruptcy Nov. 8. The creditors hope to sell a restructured Daewoo to General Motors and Fiat. Samuel Len
11/28/2000	G.M. TO LENGTHEN HOLIDAY SHUTDOWN AT EUROPEAN PLANTS	General Motors said it would lengthen the Christmas holiday shutdown at factories at Russelsheim, Germany, and Luton, England, by one to three weeks in an effort to reduce bulging inventories of unsold cars, especially midsize Vectras and larger Omegas. G.M.'s sales in Western Europe slid 7 percent in the year through October, compared with the first 10 months of 1999, and the company has said it expects to post a ''significant'' fourth-quarter loss in Europe.
11/21/2000	Auto Sales Have Slowed This Month	Auto sales, often a leading indicator of the economy's health, have slowed since the beginning of the month, prompting carmakers to increase their already deep discounts and to consider additional temporary closings of factories, industry officials said today. General Motors and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have already closed some factories for a week at a time and appear likely to announce further temporary closings soon, they said. Ford Motor has avoided closing factories so far, except because of parts shortages, but its officials have been warning that the entire industry is slowing. And even foreign automakers are seeing some weakness in sales and have been offering many discounts.
11/18/2000	Army's Armored Vehicles Are Already Behind Schedule	The Army today unveiled a new family of light armored vehicles that a senior officer called a step toward ''a new 21st century Army,'' and then announced that that step was nearly a year and a half behind schedule. The new ''interim armored vehicles,'' to be built at a cost of nearly $4 billion, are intended to equip six new brigades the Army is creating in hopes of fielding more agile combat units than today's heaviest forces. The first of those brigades was supposed to be ready to go next year, but today's announcement made it clear that deadline could be pushed well into 2003.
11/17/2000	Woods Has Hammer, But Needs Soft Touch	Mercedes-Benz will never irritate Tiger Woods again. Among the complaints against the PGA Tour aired last week by Woods and his agent, Mark Steinberg, was the need for the Tour to protect Woods from advertisements by tournament sponsors that conflict with the companies he endorses.
11/14/2000	Auto Workers Stage Walkout For Higher Wages in Brazil	Auto workers in the state of Sao Paulo walked off assembly lines today in an effort to persuade car manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors, to increase wages. The work stoppage, which also affects Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and Scania A.B., comes as carmakers are trying to increase output to meet rising demand in Brazil. Sao Paulo accounts for more than 60 percent of the country's car production.
11/14/2000	People	* Betsy Lazar, director for media operations at General Motors, Detroit, was promoted to the new post of general director for media operations. She will oversee the company's media planning operations, which are handled by G. M. Planworks, a unit of the Bcom3 Group. * Linda Recupero, managing director for the United States brand marketing practice at Burson-Marsteller, New York, part of the Young & Rubicam unit of the WPP Group, was promoted to chairwoman. Ms. Recupero assumes duties that had been handled by Chet Burchett, now president and chief executive for United States operations at Burson-Marsteller.
11/12/2000	In This Gilded Age, Gilded Model T's	AUTOMAKERS have long portrayed themselves as building cars for everyday American families. Henry Ford took pride in the spartan features of the Model T, available only in black. Alfred Sloan offered a ''ladder'' of models, from simple Chevrolets to elegant Cadillacs, with the slogan, ''a car for every purse and purpose.'' Times change. Increasingly, auto companies are setting their sights on another target. The open secret in Detroit these days is that middle-income Americans are buying a slowly but steadily shrinking share of new automobiles. The people buying the bulk of the new cars and sport utility vehicles are the nation's affluent.
11/9/2000	GENERAL MOTORS TO IDLE 2,200 WORKERS AT VAN PLANT	The General Motors Corporation, which is cutting back vehicle production for the fourth quarter because of swelling inventories of unsold cars and trucks, said it would idle about 2,200 workers at its Wentzville, Miss., commercial van plant for two weeks beginning Monday. The plant makes the Chevrolet Express and Savana full-size vans. G.M. idled two Michigan car assembly plants for a week last month, affecting about 9,500 workers, as it sought to ease oversupplies of unsold Oldsmobile Auroras and other vehicles.
11/9/2000	Daewoo Motor in Bankruptcy After Creditors Balk	Creditors moved today to cut off the money that was keeping the Daewoo Motor Company afloat, forcing it into bankruptcy. The move came after Daewoo's union refused to accept layoffs and pay cuts that were aimed at making the company an attractive acquisition for General Motors.
11/2/2000	U.S. Auto Sales Sag, Another Slowdown Sign	Not even aggressive discounting by automakers could lift sales of new cars and light trucks last month, and bloated inventories of unsold models have led to the closing for a week of 8 of the nation's 55 auto assembly plants. Auto sales are the first important economic indicator to come out at the beginning of each month, and today's results were another sign that growth in the American economy has been slowing somewhat recently. Although sales have leveled off at a high level by historical standards, they are increasingly being sustained by ever more generous rebates and low-rate loans, rather than by strong consumer demand.

10/25/2000	Moving Beyond The Basics: Internet as Tool For Innovation	INSURANCE means more than insurance companies, and different sectors are experimenting with the Internet in different ways. Here are some snapshots of recent activities by the government and private industry, by for-profit and nonprofit health maintenance organizations and by Blue Cross and Blue Shield. HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION -- One big step toward widespread electronic processing of insurance claims came in August, when the agency, which runs Medicare and Medicaid, proposed a standard format to streamline the processing of health care claims throughout the industry.
10/24/2000	The Race Begins to Build a Small Car for China	General Motors said today that it would begin producing a small car in China in December, the first of several such offerings planned by some of the world's largest automakers, each hoping to dominate this country's potentially huge market. Based on the Opel Corsa that G.M. makes in Brazil, the car will be sold under the Buick brand and will be called the Sail in English, a transliteration of its Chinese name, Sai Ou, which means roughly ''compete with Europe.'' General Motors' China operations expect to face competition from European as well as American and Japanese manufacturers after China joins the World Trade Organization and car import duties fall.
10/23/2000	EROTICA INC. -- A special report.; Technology Sent Wall Street Into Market for Pornography	The video-store chain that Larry W. Peterman owned in this valley of wide streets and ubiquitous churches carried the kind of rentals found anywhere in the country -- from Disney classics to films about the sexual adventures of nurses. Mr. Peterman built a thriving business until he was charged last year with selling obscene material and faced the prospect of bankruptcy and jail. Just before the trial, Mr. Peterman's lawyer, Randy Spencer, came up with an idea while looking out the window of the courtroom at the Provo Marriott. He sent an investigator to the hotel to record all the sex films that a guest could obtain through the hotel's pay-per-view channels. He then obtained records on how much erotic fare people here were buying from their cable and satellite television providers.
10/23/2000	Oldsmobile Invites 3 To Vie for Account	The Oldsmobile division of General Motors is inviting three agencies to compete for creative responsibility on a new divisional campaign that will also be used for all individual vehicle advertising. The decision could change Oldsmobile's relationship with its lead agency, Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, which has worked for Oldsmobile since 1967. Billings have not been determined. Gus Buenz, a spokesman for Oldsmobile in Detroit, confirmed a report in the daily fax edition of Advertising Age, adding that the agencies invited are: Burnett, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3 Group; E. Morris Communications in Chicago, the agency that handles advertising aimed at African-American consumers for Oldsmobile; and the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Another McCann office, McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy, Mich., handles creative duties for the Buick division of G. M., and was recently named to handle corporate advertising and marketing for G. M.

The cases, filed under seal two years ago but recently unsealed on motions by The New York Times and the ABC News program ''20/20,'' accuse the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation of participating in lending arrangements with car dealers that have resulted in blacks paying higher finance charges than whites on dealer-arranged loans for buying cars.
10/22/2000	As Biggest Business, Wal-Mart Propels Changes Elsewhere	Sometime before the end of the year, a milestone in American capitalism will pass. Wal-Mart Stores' annual sales are on track to exceed those of General Motors, the largest American company for much of the last half-century. Soaring oil prices will help Exxon Mobil edge Wal-Mart out of the top slot this year, but oil companies' fortunes routinely rise and fall with the state of affairs in the Middle East. In contrast, Wal-Mart's relentless and rapid rise is transforming whole industries, from consumer manufacturing to retailing and food processing and sales. Indeed, its reach is now so broad that Wal-Mart is lending extra momentum to important elements of the new economy, including the globalization of manufacturing and the use of technology to achieve productivity gains.
10/13/2000	General Motors' Earnings Decline 5.5% in Quarter	Facing falling sales in Europe and stiff competition in the United States, General Motors said yesterday that its third-quarter profit dropped 5.5 percent, but its per-share earnings topped analysts' expectations by a penny. The company, however, warned that fourth-quarter earnings might fall short of analysts' forecasts.
10/13/2000	G.M. Expands Agency Roster	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had expanded its agency roster by naming Modernista in Boston to handle the account of the Hummer brand of wide-body vehicles. Billings were estimated at $20 million to $35 million. Marc Hernandez, brand manager in Detroit for Hummer, for which G.M. recently acquired the marketing rights, said the decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to Modernista and three agencies he declined to name.
10/11/2000	G.M. RECALLING BRAZILIAN CAR	In an operation that would involve vehicles sold in Brazil and abroad, General Motors said it planned to recall all Corsa model cars made in Brazil. The company declined to give further details, saying that an official announcement would be made on Monday. The recall is expected to begin next week. The company declined to comment on a report in the Brazilian daily O Valor Economico that the recall covered close to a million cars and would replace a seat belt that could come loose. Jennifer L.

10/10/2000	G.M. TO ASSESS DAEWOO ASSETS	The General Motors Corporation and Fiat said they would evaluate the assets and businesses of the Daewoo Motor Company before making any decision about buying all or part of the ailing South Korean automaker. ''G.M. and Fiat will conduct a preliminary due diligence,'' which is ''expected to proceed rapidly and upon further agreement will be followed by formal negotiations,'' General Motors said in a statement. G.M., the world's largest automaker, and Fiat, the sixth largest, became the most likely candidates to purchase Daewoo Motor after the Ford Motor Company withdrew a $7 billion bid last month.

10/9/2000	G.M. Said to Declare Intent To Buy Korean Carmaker	General Motors has submitted a written intention to buy the Daewoo Motor Company, the Financial Supervisory Commission said today, raising hopes that Korea's second-largest carmaker will be sold. ''G.M. submitted the letter of intent to Oh Ho Gen,'' the former chairman of Daewoo's restructuring committee, ''that it wants to take over Daewoo Motor,'' said Choi Kun Ho, head of the commission's press department. He could not confirm whether G.M. wanted Daewoo Motor and its units as a single package.
10/9/2000	General Motors drops Ayer in favor of McCann-Erickson as agency for corporate advertising.	AN era in automotive advertising is coming to a close as the General Motors Corporation ends its relationship with N. W. Ayer & Partners after 28 years. Since 1972, Ayer had been creating corporate campaigns that sought to stimulate the sales of G.M. cars and trucks by burnishing the reputation of the General Motors brand rather than by promoting specific products or divisions. But on Friday, General Motors said it would shift the responsibilities for corporate advertising and marketing from the Ayer office in the Detroit suburb of Troy, Mich., which had G.M. as its only client, to another agency that has worked for General Motors for many decades, McCann-Erickson Detroit, also based in Troy.
10/4/2000	G.M.'s Sales Are Off, but Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Are Up	General Motors' United States auto sales fell last month as overseas rivals had gains and DaimlerChrysler offered deep discounts to move an aging minivan line. Ford Motor's sales rose on increases for the Explorer sport utility vehicle and other light trucks.
10/3/2000	A New Bridgestone/Firestone Tire Inquiry	Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc., a unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, said tonight that it had made 27.5 million Firestone Steeltex tires, the brand that federal regulators began investigating last Friday after receiving 169 complaints of tire failure. The tires were made from 1991 to 2000 in Aiken, S.C.; Decatur, Ill.; Joliette, Quebec; Lavergne, Tenn.; and Wilson, N.C. General Motors said today that it had put the tires on some of its 1994 to 2001 Chevrolet and GMC full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and some of its 1996 to 2001 Chevrolet and GMC full-size and one-ton passenger and cargo vans. Ford Motor had said on Friday that at least since last year, it had been putting the tires on all of its Excursion full-size sport utility vehicles and 40 percent of its Super Duty pickup trucks and Econoline vans.
9/30/2000	A 2nd Front In the Inquiry Into Firestone	Federal regulators said today that they had opened a second investigation into Firestone tires, this time involving Steeltex tires used on the largest sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said that it had received 169 complaints of problems with the tires, involving 8 crashes, 12 injuries and 2 deaths. The complaints covered many tires on Suburban sport utility vehicles and large vans made by General Motors as well as Excursion sport utility vehicles and F250 and F350 pickup trucks made by Ford.
9/25/2000	Liberty Media and News Corp. Said to Be Negotiating a Deal	John C. Malone and Rupert Murdoch are considering a deal that would increase their investments in each other's companies, according to people close to the discussions. The complex transaction would streamline the holdings of Liberty Media, the company controlled by Mr. Malone, and would give Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation a larger interest in Gemstar-TV Guide International, in which News Corporation already has a 20 percent stake. And the deal could put News Corporation in a better position to bid for the Hughes Electronics division of General Motors. G.M. has said it is considering an outright sale of the company, a merger or partnerships and joint ventures with other companies.

General Motors shares, which rose in August when G.M. disclosed Mr. Icahn's plans, are likely to fall today when investors learn that he has backed away, said John Casesa, auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.

But G.M. has not recalled the vehicles because it does not have replacement parts.
9/12/2000	U.S. Approves Formation of Supply Web Site for Automakers	Federal antitrust regulators approved today the establishment of an online venture that would allow five major automakers -- including the top three in America -- to buy supplies through a single Internet portal.

9/6/2000	GENERAL MOTORS WILL LAY OFF 200 WORKERS IN MICHIGAN	General Motors said yesterday that it would lay off about 200 workers and dismiss another 20 at a Michigan plant in late October as the company halves production of slow-selling Cadillac Eldorado coupes. G.M. plans to eliminate one of two shifts at the Lansing, Mich., plant, idling more than a third of the 550 production workers, who build about 40 of the luxury cars daily. Those being dismissed are salaried and contract workers, who will be offered other jobs at the company, a spokeswoman said. G.M. sold 7,576 Eldorados this year through August, down 20 percent from 9,488 in the 1999 period. G.M. shares fell 19 cents, to $72.94.
9/6/2000	The Publicity For 'Jazz'	About a year ago Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker, sat down with his public relations advisers as well as executives from General Motors, his corporate sponsor, and PBS to figure out how best to promote his documentary ''Jazz,'' which is to begin running on PBS in January.

9/4/2000	Icahn's Move Forces G.M. To Consider Hughes Deal	When General Motors announced last month that Carl C. Icahn was buying its stock, Wall Street analysts quickly surmised that he saw potential in the Hughes Electronics Corporation, the satellite-television unit. General Motors, which acquired Hughes Aircraft in 1985, has sought ways in recent years to unlock the value of the fast-growing unit, whose coveted satellite TV operation known as DirecTV is expected to have 10 million subscribers by year-end. Early on, G.M. issued a Hughes tracking stock, which reflects the performance of the unit.
9/1/2000	High Fashion for Fall: Black Tie and Tailgates	BLACK is back. Not the color, necessarily, but the name. Yesterday, at the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, Lincoln introduced its 2002 Blackwood luxury truck. And Buick has put the final touches on a show car, the Blackhawk, that will make the rounds of custom-car and hot-rod shows. The full-size, four-door Lincoln pickup, which closely resembles a design study that was a sensation at auto shows last year, is essentially a Navigator S.U.V. with a pickup bed instead of a wagon-type cargo area. Side-hinged Dutch doors give access to the bed; electric motors open and close the hard tonneau cover. The bed is lined with stainless steel, punctuated by L.E.D. strips that provide illumination.
8/19/2000	Icahn Building a Stake in General Motors	One of the most famous corporate raiders of the 1980's and 1990's, Carl C. Icahn, has begun accumulating a stake in General Motors, the world's largest company, in a move that will increase pressure on the automaker to spin off its most valuable asset, Hughes Electronics. In a letter to G.M. Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he intended to buy at least $15 million of the automaker's stock and up to 15 percent of its outstanding shares, G.M. said this morning. Federal antitrust laws require people who want to be active investors in publicly traded companies to provide notification if they begin acquiring stakes in that range.

Two years after his leukemia was diagnosed, and treated with a bone marrow transplant, Mr. Pearce, who is in remission, is taking on a second personal battle: to help raise funds to fight leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma -- all blood-related cancers. Mr. Pearce is asking his corporate peers in the United States and around the world to match G.M.'s $1.5 million grant, which will finance the new Specialized Center of Research program of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The program plans to distribute a total of $67.5 million to nine teams of scientists over three years to map the genes responsible for these cancers and to develop new treatments.

G.M. already has an elaborate site, called gmbuypower.com, that refers potential customers to its dealers. But a vast majority of online car shoppers have chosen sites offering all makes of cars, like Autobytel.com and CarPoint from Microsoft. Moreover, an increasing number of car buyers are using Internet services that post no-haggle prices, rather than require the customer to negotiate with a dealer.

8/6/2000	At the G.O.P. Convention, Carmakers Toot Horns ...	It was the battle of the cars at the Republican National Convention, between G.M. and DaimlerChrysler. On Sunday night, G.M., which gave $1 million to the convention's host committee, held a party for 2,000 people. It featured Hank Williams Jr. and a replica of the Batmobile. DaimlerChrysler, which had given the host committee $250,000, held a reception honoring Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma that featured the Temptations and a gold Phaeton, a futuristic concept car.
8/6/2000	G.M.

8/5/2000	DANA, MAKER OF TRUCK AXLES, IS AWARDED BIG CONTRACT	The Dana Corporation, the world's largest maker of light-truck axles, won a contract from the General Motors Corporation for as much as $150 million a year, an analyst, David Garrity, said. Dana would not identify the size of the contract, for car and cargo-van axles starting with 2003 models, or the automaker involved. The order will be filled by plants in Missouri and Virginia.
8/4/2000	G.M. Set to Expand Engine Block Line	General Motors said today that it would spend about $160 million to build a new line of aluminum engine blocks at an Ohio plant as the company, the world's largest automaker, turns to lighter, more efficient engines.
8/4/2000	Companies Ended Soft Donations But Still Play the Influence Game	When General Motors became the first corporation to voluntarily stop writing large checks to political parties in 1997, the automaker's executives sent a powerful message that they were disgusted by the political culture of cash and influence. ''It's the principle,'' G.M.'s vice chairman, Harry J. Pearce, said after announcing the decision in May 1997.
8/4/2000	TOYOTA DISAGREES WITH ORDER CONFIRMATION BY G.M.	The Toyota Motor Corporation said General Motors was premature in announcing that Toyota would use G.M.'s OnStar communications system in its vehicles. Toyota is in discussions with G.M. to use OnStar on ''a few new models'' but no agreement has been signed, Toyota said in a statement. OnStar, a G.M. subsidiary, uses global-positioning technology and wireless communications to allow owners to track a stolen vehicle, call for roadside help or gain access to navigation information. On Monday, Ford Motor introduced a competing service with Qualcomm Inc. Nissan has said it will use Ford's service in its Infiniti luxury vehicles.
8/3/2000	G.M. to Build Plant in Suburb Of Buffalo, Saving 600 Jobs	General Motors will build a $500 million high-tech engine manufacturing plant at its complex in the Buffalo suburb of Tonawanda, saving 600 well-paying jobs through the largest private-sector investment in western New York State in many years, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday. Had the company chosen to build the plant in another state or in Canada or Mexico, something state officials said G.M. had been considering, it would have been a major blow to the Buffalo area because the 600 blue-collar jobs would have been phased out from the Tonawanda complex's 3,800 existing jobs.
8/3/2000	Ford in Talks to Build a Small Car in China	The Ford Motor Company is deep in negotiations with the Changan Automobile Group to build an affordable passenger car in China, the latest in a series of signs that the country is loosening its grip on the auto industry ahead of its expected entry into the World Trade Organization later this year. Ford has tried for years to get into the Chinese market after having lost to General Motors in a fierce competition in the mid-90's for the last major car deal sanctioned under the government's auto-industry master plan. After G.M. won the right to build Buicks in Shanghai, officials started talking instead about shutting manufacturers down. China has more than 100 car manufacturers, including those that assemble cars using kits imported from abroad.
8/3/2000	General Motors Raises Stakes in Fuel Economy War with Ford	General Motors challenged Ford today to a battle over which company can deliver bigger improvements in fuel economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles, the least efficient vehicles of all. Ford committed itself last week to improve the average mileage of its sport utility vehicles by almost five miles a gallon over the next five years. General Motors announced today that no matter how much Ford improved the energy efficiency of its sport utilities by 2005, G.M.'s sport utilities would average even more miles to the gallon by then.
8/2/2000	Digital Music, Chapter 2	By coincidence, as a federal judge ruled last week that the Internet music file-sharing company Napster was operating in violation of copyright law, EMI Music Distribution was just putting its own commercial downloading program into action. In other words, as one system of music downloading was fighting for its life (Napster appealed the judge's decision), another system was being born. But the two are far from similar. Napster is an Internet music market created by the consumer, where songs are traded for free and without rules; EMI's system is an example of an Internet music market envisaged by the major labels, where online music is bought for the same price as in CD form but with a new set of rules restricting its use. So which way do you want it?
8/2/2000	Car Sales Rise, Except at G.M. And Chrysler	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said today that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories. Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force in the American economy during July.
8/1/2000	New Assignments For 3 Executives	Top executives are being named to assignments at three agencies. Dennis Donlin is becoming president of a new unit of the Starcom MediaVest Group being formed to handle the consolidated United States media planning assignment for the General Motors Corporation. The new unit, tentatively named G.M. Planworks, will be based in the Detroit area and decide where to run advertising with an annual budget estimated at $2.9 billion; G.M. selected Starcom MediaVest, part of the B Com3 Group, to handle the assignment last week.
7/26/2000	G.M. Unites Media Planning At New Shop	The largest assignment in the history of Madison Avenue was made yesterday when General Motors consolidated responsibilities for media planning -- deciding where to run ads with an annual budget of $2.9 billion -- at a new shop to be formed by a unit of the giant agency company known as the B Com3 Group. The consolidation of media planning under the unit, the Starcom MediaVest Group, came after a monthlong review of three contenders and will affect all G.M. brands sold in the United States except Saab and Saturn.
7/21/2000	G.M. OPENS BRAZIL PLANT	Betting on improved demand for cars in Brazil, the General Motors Corporation inaugurated a $600 million subcompact car plant in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. The plant can produce 120,000 cars a year of a new one-liter engine model called the Celta. The property will also hold factories for 16 of G.M.'s suppliers. G.M. plans to invest $1.5 billion in Brazil by 2003. Jennifer L. Rich (NYT)
7/19/2000	G.M. Revamps Incentive Plan Even After Profits Rise	General Motors today revamped its sales discounts for the third quarter, while announcing that its profits had inched up in the second quarter instead of falling slightly, as had been expected. G.M. raised its rebates by $500 on a wide range of cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. But the company also increased the lowest available interest rates on its discounted auto loans, to 3.9 percent from 0.9 percent. Recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve have made it prohibitively expensive for automakers to continue subsidizing deeply discounted loans.
7/8/2000	LOPEZ TO FIGHT EXTRADITION	In an appearance before a Spanish judge, the former General Motors executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said he would fight extradition to the United States. A grand jury in Detroit indicted Mr. Lopez in May on six criminal counts related to accusations that he stole company secrets from G.M. when he went to work for a rival, Volkswagen. The judge will now investigate the case and then make a recommendation on extradition to a three-judge panel. The Spanish cabinet will make the final decision. Benjamin Jones (NYT)
7/6/2000	LOPEZ CLOSER TO EXTRADITION	Spanish prosecutors have given preliminary approval for the former General Motors executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to be extradited to the United States, where he is wanted on charges of stealing company secrets. Mr. Lopez is to appear in court tomorrow to state whether he will fight the extradition. He was indicted in May by a federal grand jury in Detroit. Benjamin Jones (NYT)
7/4/2000	Big U.S. Automakers' Sales Dropped 1.4% Last Month	Americans bought fewer autos from General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler than expected in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they own. Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8 percent.
7/2/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2001 Chevrolet Corvette Z06; What's All the Excitement About?	SO here we are in Dullsville, having a thrill a minute. Not because of the nightlife, or even the wildlife, but because we roared into this western Ohio hamlet in Chevrolet's fastest, most secret, most exciting production Corvette yet. Called the Z06, it has 385 horsepower -- 35 more than a standard 2001 'Vette -- and it is aimed head-on at weekend racers whose priorities are speed, speed and speed -- in that order. The car, with a price of $47,500, reaches dealerships this month and is likely to show up immediately in autocross competitions or at Corvette Club track events.
6/29/2000	FORD SAID TO LEAD IN DAEWOO BID	South Korean news reports said Ford Motor had won exclusive negotiating rights to buy the heavily indebted Daewoo Motor from a committee of creditors, beating out rival bids from an alliance between DaimlerChrysler and Hyundai Motor and an alliance between General Motors and Fiat. The Korea Economic Daily said the Ford and Daimler-Hyundai bids were each about $6 billion and the G.M.-Fiat bid was lower. G.M. said its alliance was still bidding. None of the other companies or the creditors would comment on the reports. Samuel Len
6/28/2000	Businesses and Schools	To the Editor: ''Schools Turning From Teaching Trades'' (front page, June 21) did not mention the trend of school-to-work partnerships between businesses and schools. One study predicts that by the year 2005, only 21 percent of the jobs generated in this country will require a college degree. School-to-work partnerships play a vital role in matching skills with job requirements.
6/27/2000	G.M. Reviewing Media Planning	General Motors is beginning a review for the American media planning account of its Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile and Pontiac divisions. The assignment involves deciding where to run advertising. The company spends $2.6 billion annually on advertising, making this the largest account review ever on Madison Avenue. Peg Holmes, a spokeswoman for General Motors in Detroit, confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek.
6/27/2000	BIDDING FOR DAEWOO	Two leading automakers have formed separate alliances in the international bidding for South Korea's ailing Daewoo Motor. DaimlerChrysler announced a $428 million deal to buy 10 percent of Daewoo's larger domestic competitor, Hyundai Motor, and they submitted a joint bid for Daewoo. General Motors and Fiat announced they also would join forces. Creditors of Daewoo, which carries $18 billion in debt, intend to select a winning bidder by the end of September. The foreign bidders also include Ford Motor. Samuel Len (NYT)
6/17/2000	The Big City; When Tables Turn, Knives Come Out	MICHAEL MOORE made a name for himself pointing cameras at cruel corporate executives and other enemies of the people. He stalked the chairman of General Motors, sent people in Puritan costumes to Ken Starr's home and set up a Web site with a camera trained on a window of Lucianne Goldberg's apartment. But Mr. Moore does not appreciate being bothered himself, as Alan Edelstein discovered. After he was fired by Mr. Moore, Mr. Edelstein tried borrowing the technique Mr. Moore had applied to G.M.'s Roger Smith in the film ''Roger & Me'': showing up uninvited with a camera and trying to get an answer from a boss who has decided to downsize.
6/16/2000	Efficiency on Wheels; U.S. Auto Industry Is Catching Up With the Japanese	The Ford Taurus factory in Atlanta has no air-conditioning to ward off the sweltering heat of the Georgia summer. Its scuffed concrete floors and sooty ceiling beams hold the grit of 53 years of car-building. On the assembly line, orange robots weld car roofs and sides and, farther down, hundreds of men and women install the cars' interiors. To all appearances, it is an utterly ordinary car factory. Yet the Atlanta plant is, in fact, special. According to a highly regarded annual study released yesterday, it was the most efficient in North America last year, representing the first time that an American-owned auto plant has surpassed Japanese-owned factories on this continent in labor productivity.
6/14/2000	G.M. PLACES $5.6 BILLION OF STOCK IN EMPLOYEE PLANS	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had contributed 60.5 million shares of G.M. Class H common stock, valued at about $5.6 billion, to employee benefit plans. The company transmitted 53.6 million shares to its United States hourly rate employees pension plan and 6.9 million shares to its welfare benefit trust, a voluntary employees' health-care and life insurance benefit trust. The contributions are part of the company's plan to restructure its economic interest in its Hughes Electronics unit, G.M.'s wholly owned subsidiary that makes satellite TV systems. The move will reduce G.M.'s annual pension and retirement benefit expenses and improve operating earnings.
6/13/2000	Conde Nast, the League of Women Voters and Oldsmobile join forces to urge women to vote.	THIS year's presidential election has prompted plenty of advertisements that either promote or attack the candidates. Now an unexpected triumvirate -- Conde Nast, the League of Women Voters and Oldsmobile -- is producing a public awareness campaign that advertises the election itself and particularly encourages women to vote. ''In the last presidential election, 36 percent of the overall population voted -- the lowest it has been in a while,'' said Dr. Carolyn Jefferson-Jenkins, the president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters in Washington.
6/11/2000	Creative Renewal at Delphi	WHEN Debbie Bittner learned that her employer, General Motors, planned to spin off its automotive parts division as Delphi Automotive Systems last year, she faced leaving the only company she had ever known. Her first job out of high school had been at a G.M. steering-column plant in Saginaw, Mich., and for more than 21 years she held nine jobs in six different parts of the company, from finance to operations to customer care. G.M. was family. Her father, Fred Keyes, recently retired after 38 years as a skilled tradesman. Her grandfather had been a foundry worker. Yet as proud as she is of her G.M. roots, she finds herself defending her allegiance to Delphi, to which she was assigned on Jan. 1, 1999. ''My father said, 'Maybe you should see if you can stay with G.M.,' '' she said, recalling a recent conversation with him and her brother, Mark Keyes, who also works at Delphi. ''We said, 'No, we think this is a good thing.' ''
6/10/2000	FORMER G.M. EXECUTIVE SOUGHT	The United States Justice Department formally petitioned Spain to extradite Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to stand trial in the United States on charges of industrial espionage. Mr. Lopez left the Opel subsidiary of General Motors in Germany to go to Volkswagen in 1992, and General Motors accused him of stealing vast quantities of documents -- many later shredded -- when he left. Volkswagen pushed out Mr. Lopez in late 1996 and in 1997 settled lawsuits with General Motors. Edmund L. Andrews (NYT)
1/2/2014	G.M.'s New Chief Sticks to Company Plans	G. Richard Wagoner Jr., who became the youngest chief executive of General Motors last Thursday, said at the company's annual meeting here today that he planned to maintain the current business strategies and he expected that new truck models and an emphasis on Internet marketing would lift the G.M. market share. Mr. Wagoner, 47, said that having helped develop the current strategy over the last year and a half as G.M.'s president, he did not see an immediate need to change it. ''It gives us a great chance to build off what we're doing,'' he said at a news conference after the meeting.
6/5/2000	U.S. Vehicle Sales in May	Vehicle sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. DaimlerChrysler and General Motors accounted for the entire decline, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun.
6/4/2000	Balancing Hybrids vs. Electrics on the Environmental Scale	HYBRID gas-electric cars can be clean and very fuel-efficient, and may, if automakers persuade regulators, be used to fill the quota for battery-electric cars that California, New York and Massachusetts plan to require. But engineers are learning that hybrids cannot accomplish everything that environmentalists want. That point was demonstrated at the end of the 12th running of an alternative-vehicle race, the American Tour de Sol, here on May 18, when race organizers set out to rank the competing cars on a variety of scales. One criterion was energy efficiency, which was measured on a miles-per-gallon basis for the hybrid vehicles that used gasoline or diesel fuel; for battery-electric vehicles, organizers came up with an equivalent measure based on how much fuel an electric utility would need at its power plant to make the electricity the vehicle consumed. Another criterion was the cars' potential contribution to global warming.
6/2/2000	With Loophole, Carmakers Post Mileage Gain	A soon-to-be- released government report shows a slight increase in the fuel economy of family vehicles in the 2000 model year. But the rise is mostly thanks to a loophole that gives carmakers extra mileage credit for vehicles that can run on ethanol, even though virtually no one uses that fuel. Ethanol is sold by only 108 of the nation's 178,000 service stations. Nonetheless, General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are producing roughly 750,000 dual-fuel minivans, small pickup trucks and cars this year at an extra cost of up to $300 each. These vehicles are counted by the government as getting roughly triple the gas mileage that they actually achieve, allowing manufacturers to sell more full-sized sport utilities and pickups while still meeting federal standards for average fuel economy.
6/2/2000	Auto Sales Declined 2% Last Month	Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun. Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American economy might be slowing.
6/1/2000	CANADIAN AUTO SUBSIDIES	A World Trade Organization appeals panel has upheld a ruling against Canada's laws on importing automotive products. It affirmed a decision last fall that a 1965 Canada-United States auto pact violated free trade rules by giving subsidies to American manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors. Toyota Canada issued a statement urging the Canadian government to lower duties for all manufacturers or force American automakers to repay the ''illegal subsidies they have received over the past few years.'' Elizabeth Olson
5/28/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon; Big Enough for a Trek to Texas	FIVE years ago, when General Motors ran its huge Suburban through a buzzsaw, cutting a 20-inch slice from its length, it created the Chevrolet Tahoe and the GMC Yukon: shorter, more manageable sport utilities with major V-8 power that could seat up to six people and practically tow a mountain. What the new utilities lacked was a third row of seats, like the one in the Suburban, and the bright lights at Ford and Dodge didn't let G.M. forget it. In a year, Ford brought out the Expedition, with three rows, and a year later Dodge crammed a third bench into its slightly smaller Durango.
5/26/2000	Honda Plans OnStar For Acura Sedans	The Honda Motor Company, Japan's second-biggest automaker, is planningd to equip United States versions of its Acura sedans with the General Motors Corporation's OnStar satellite navigation and information devices starting in 2002. Financial terms were not disclosed. The Tokyo-based company will offer OnStar mobile communications services in Honda and Acura vehicles starting with the 2002 Acura RL luxury sedan sold in the United States. Honda will eventually offer OnStar in other models.
5/23/2000	G.M. in Deal On Fuel Cells	General Motors said today that it had formed an alliance with Giner Inc. to refine fuel-cell technology to power cars and trucks. The financial terms were not disclosed. The companies said they would work to speed development of commercially viable fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to make electricity. One significant hurdle is lowering the cost for mass production of fuel-cell vehicles.
5/23/2000	Toyota Plans to Join Buying Exchange	The Toyota Motor Corporation has told the General Motors Corporation that it will join the Internet exchange being formed by G.M. and other vehicle manufacturers to cut purchasing costs. Meetings are being held this week between representatives of the exchange, called Covisint, and Toyota, said David Barnas, a spokesman for G.M. Toyota would be the sixth automaker to participate.
5/23/2000	Former G.M. Executive Indicted On Charges of Taking Secrets	A former senior executive at General Motors has been indicted on charges of defrauding the company by taking boxes of its confidential documents with him when he jumped to a top job at Volkswagen in 1993, reviving one of the most celebrated cases in recent years involving accusations of industrial espionage. The six-count indictment by a federal grand jury here accuses Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, G.M.'s former vice president for worldwide purchasing, of wire fraud and the interstate transportation of stolen property. The Justice Department asserted that Mr. Lopez copied extensive G.M. computer files on auto parts costs and future car models and took them to VW when he took the top purchasing job at the German automaker.
5/22/2000	Corrections	A report by Reuters in the Company News column of Business Day on Wednesday about an agreement for General Motors car dealerships to use Reynolds & Reynolds computer technology misstated the terms of the transfer of a 10 percent stake in Reynolds & Reynolds to G.M. The stake is being given, not bought.
5/17/2000	G.M. Plays a Wild Card in France	IT is easy to lose one's way when driving through the neighborhoods of this city, especially in those hours before dawn when the street signs above the corner tabacs, boulangeries and patisseries fade into darkness. The new Cadillac Seville that had cruised so majestically down the Champs-Elysees the night before now crept tentatively through the narrow, deserted streets while the driver rehearsed his supplicative refrain: ''Excusez-moi de vous deranger, Monsieur; ou est la rue. . . . ?'' Up ahead, a figure emerged from a small hotel lugging cartons to the street and the car slid over to the curb. But before the driver could utter a word, the grinning hotelier approached to ask, in perfect English: ''Hi. Are you lost?'' In a manner of speaking, yes. But, how could he tell the driver was American?
5/14/2000	A Rising Star, Lured to G.M.'s Sky	''I'M a designer,'' Anne Asensio begins, ''before being a car guy, as they say.'' So it is not too surprising that General Motors, wanting to breathe new life into its cautious designs, has hired this Frenchwoman, age 37, from Renault, the French automaker whose revival has relied on attention-catching styles.
5/14/2000	Why G.M. Is Getting A Cold Shoulder	THE car business is booming these days -- in Europe, Mexico and Brazil as well as in the United States -- and the shares of General Motors have climbed nearly 17 percent so far this year. Of course, G.M. has major technology exposure in the form of its Hughes Electronics business. (While G.M. owns all of Hughes's assets, G.M.'s class H shares are designed to track the unit's earnings independently.) Even with G.M.'s run-up, however, its stock trades at less than nine times projected earnings, scarcely one-third the average multiple accorded the Dow industrials.
5/12/2000	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Safety; A Debate Over Daytime Headlamps	WHEN safety ideas come along, the government is usually the first to embrace them. Automakers are dragged along later, sometimes kicking and screaming. But with daytime running lamps, the pattern is reversed. General Motors equips all of its vehicles with the lamps and hopes its competitors will do the same. Greg Martin, a spokesman, said the daytime lamps were good for the public and not a competitive technology. ''We have a whole history of adopting certain safety technologies,'' he said, including crash dummies and breakaway light poles. ''We simply open up the toy chest and let others beg, borrow or steal.''
5/11/2000	NO LAYOFFS, G.M. PROMISES DAEWOO	Vowing there would be no layoffs at the Daewoo Motor Company, Jack Smith, the chairman of General Motors, tried to win support for its bid to acquire the ailing South Korean carmaker. The rival bidder Ford Motor has made similar promises. Samuel Len
5/9/2000	General Motors Hires Away A Top Renault Designer	General Motors, which has struggled for years to make its cars less boring, announced today that it had hired a star designer who helped transform Renault from an also-ran in the European auto industry into one of the industry's most feared competitors. The designer, Anne Asensio, 37, is widely thought to be the most important influence in three of Renault's biggest hits of the 1990's: the small, quirky Scenic minivan and the Clio and Twingo small cars. The Scenic in particular has given Renault some standing as an innovative automaker, becoming the best-selling vehicle in Britain despite the longstanding suspicion with which many Britons view French products. Scenic is the first non-British vehicle to achieve the top ranking there.
5/9/2000	The Long, Long Wait for Cars; Automakers Try to Speed Process of Ordering Vehicles	Order a personal computer online or over the phone, choosing every specification, and it will be assembled and shipped to your door in five or six days. But try to order a car from the factory that way, and watch out. Buyers who place such orders face stupefyingly complex forms asking them about sometimes obscure features like axle ratios for towing. The few brave enough to fill out the paperwork -- most automakers have yet to computerize the process -- then face a wait long enough to try anyone's patience: three weeks to three months or more.
5/3/2000	Auto Sales Keep to Torrid Pace Even as Loan Costs Rise	Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American economy by now, especially the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet the stampede into the showrooms continues across the country, with every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing today that sales last month exceeded even last year's brisk pace. The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge, indigo blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. Interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he wrote a check for the entire cost of the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the proceeds from stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by the high price of gasoline.
5/2/2000	AS POLITICAL GIFTS SET A RECORD PACE, SOME STOP GIVING	Soft-money donations to the political parties are on a pace to set a record this year, but more and more large corporations have quietly stopped giving them. In some cases, senior executives say they want to distance themselves from what they describe as the capital's unseemly culture of cash and influence, while others acknowledge that their companies are simply not getting much in return for the money.
4/27/2000	Oldsmobile Head Joins Web Firm	The General Motors Corporation said this week that Karen Francis, who is departing as general manager of its Oldsmobile division, would join Internet Capital Group, an investor in electronic-commerce companies. Ms. Francis, 37, was named Internet Capital's chief marketing officer and managing director. She will leave Oldsmobile on Monday, said a spokesman, Gus Buenz. G.M. has not yet chosen a successor.
4/25/2000	Departure of Executive Is Expected at Oldsmobile	The Oldsmobile division of General Motors plans to announce later this week that its general manager, Karen Francis, has resigned, auto industry officials said today. Ms. Francis, 38, is the best-known member of a group of young G.M. managers hired from consumer products companies to revitalize the automaker's brands.
4/14/2000	General Motors Says Profit Fell Slightly in First Quarter	General Motors announced today that its profits fell slightly in the first quarter as an unexpected turnaround in its international operations was not enough to offset unusually heavy discounting in the United States and rising costs at its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. G.M.'s earnings from continuing operations edged down 2 percent, to $1.78 billion, compared with $1.82 billion in the quarter a year earlier. But because the automaker has been steadily buying back stock, its earnings per share actually climbed, to $2.80 from $2.68 in the quarter a year earlier.
4/4/2000	G.M. Executive Joins Lockheed Martin	General Motors said today that Louis Hughes, executive vice president for new business strategies, had left the company on Saturday to join Lockheed Martin as its president and chief operating officer. Mr. Hughes, 51, is replacing Peter B. Teets, who resigned from Lockheed Martin, a military contractor, last fall.
3/31/2000	Greater Fuel Efficiency Sought	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would increase production of full-size pickup trucks and sport utilities by 21 percent next year, to 1.7 million. The expanded output will be divided among a far greater number of vehicles using the same underbodies, including some models combining sport utility cabins with pickup beds. G.M. plans to increase the rate of assembly by using sophisticated welding machines and other technology, rather than by converting entire factories from car production. Such conversions are very expensive. Keith Bradsher
3/31/2000	G.M. TO INCREASE OUTPUT OF TRUCKS AND SPORT UTILITIES	In another big move toward the global consolidation of the automobile industry, DaimlerChrysler of Germany is to announce a deal tomorrow to acquire 33.4 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors for about $1.3 billion, people close to the companies said yesterday. The deal would make DaimlerChrysler the world's third-largest automaker, behind General Motors and Ford. All three will now have large shares of the three main markets: Western Europe, Japan and the United States. The other giants of the auto industry, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and the Renault-Nissan alliance, still are weak in at least one of these markets.
3/26/2000	DaimlerChrysler Nears Deal To Buy 33.4% of Mitsubishi	The world's largest automaker, the General Motors Corporation, said it would buy the shares held by the Nissan Motor Company and its affiliates in Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars. The purchase of 25.4 million shares, or roughly 4 percent of Fuji's shares outstanding, is part of G.M.'s agreement to buy a 20 percent stake in Fuji. Stephanie Strom
3/25/2000	G.M. BUYS STAKE IN FUJI	The consolidation of the global auto industry has reached a full-throttle roar as automakers around the world respond to the changing economics of the business. The list of companies partly or entirely acquired by other manufacturers in the last two years was impressive even before the frenzy of the last two weeks: Chrysler, Volvo Cars, Nissan, Saab, Fuji Heavy Industries, Suzuki, Daihatsu, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Since the beginning of last week, General Motors has agreed to buy a fifth of Fiat; Ford Motor has agreed to buy Land Rover from BMW; and DaimlerChrysler has moved close to taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Daewoo and Samsung are both up for sale in Korea, with deals likely later this year.
3/23/2000	Gentlemen, Merge Your Manufacturers; Consolidation Hits on Virtually All Cylinders	A former General Motors executive announced today that he had formed an Internet company that would aim to make it easier for the largest American companies to buy parts and supplies from minority-owned companies. ''We want to ensure that minority businesses are not left behind in the migration to online marketplaces,'' said Roy S. Roberts, the chairman, chief executive and half-owner of M-Xchange.com, a business-to-business Internet company, and a former group vice president of G.M.
3/22/2000	Former G.M. Executive Forms Web Site for Minority Suppliers	Acknowledging for the first time that sport utility vehicles pose special dangers to other motorists in crashes, automakers say that they are modifying the designs of these vehicles to make them less hazardous. General Motors says it will make the 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada, GMC Envoy and Chevrolet Blazer with steel rails up to 2 inches lower inside their underbodies than in current versions, to reduce the risk of their overriding cars' bumpers and doorsills. Ford Motor plans to do the same for its Explorer, Expedition and Lincoln Navigator over the next two model years.
3/21/2000	Marketing Executive At G.M. to Retire	Philip Guarascio, General Motors' vice president in charge of advertising and corporate marketing, will retire effective May 1 after 14 years with the company, the world's largest advertiser. Mr. Guarascio, 58, recently underwent successful triple bypass heart surgery. ''There's no doubt that my recent experience provided me with a chance to take stock, evaluate life's priorities, and move me to take advantage of some unique opportunities that are very personally attractive at this time in my career,'' he said in a statement.
3/19/2000	After G.M. Deal, Wherefore Art Thou, Alfa Romeo?	THE partnership announced last week between General Motors and Fiat opens a window for the return of Alfa Romeo to the United States. Until it withdrew in 1995, the Italian sports car maker was best known for two-seat convertibles like the Duetto that Dustin Hoffman drove in ''The Graduate.'' In Europe, Alfa Romeo, which is part of Fiat, still sells a sporty two-seat Spider convertible, as well as other models. Its 156, a successful small sport sedan, was voted Europe's 1998 Car of the Year by auto journalists. This month, at the Geneva auto show, the company introduced its 156 Sportwagon, which goes on sale in Italy this month.
3/19/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2001 Oldsmobile Aurora; Olds Wishes on a Smaller Star	IF you had walked into an Olds dealership five years ago, you would have seen the same familiar nameplates: Ninety Eight, Eighty Eight, Cutlass Supreme, Ciera. These were mostly your father's Oldsmobiles. You would also have seen a decidedly different car, the Aurora. Introduced as a 1995 model, this was an all-new, radically styled sedan intended to signal a profound change in direction for Olds, a General Motors division that had lost its way. Known in the 40's and 50's for innovative engineering, Olds captured the public's imagination in the 60's and 70's with its powerful 4-4-2 and innovative front-drive Toronado. By the mid-1980's, the division was selling more than a million cars a year; its Cutlass Supreme was one of America's favorites.
3/14/2000	Some See Takeover of Fiat In Details of Deal With G.M.	General Motors and Fiat announced a strategic cooperation deal today that some analysts called a prelude to a G.M. takeover of the troubled automotive operations of Fiat, the Italian industrial giant. Fiat officials stressed that they expected their business to remain independent. The agreement provides for both partners to collaborate broadly in Europe and Latin America in the buying and manufacturing of heavy components like motors and gear shifts. It will give G.M. a 20 percent stake in Fiat's auto division, worth $2.3 billion, in exchange for a 5.15 percent share in G.M. for Fiat.
3/13/2000	Fiat Weighs Sale to G.M. Of a Stake In Auto Line	Fiat is close to selling a minority stake in its car operations to General Motors after apparently failing to sell the entire division to DaimlerChrysler, auto industry officials and executives close to the talks said today. Fiat's board is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the proposed transaction with G.M. and is fairly likely to approve a deal, industry and other executives said today after insisting on anonymity.
3/7/2000	G.M. LOOKS TO INCREASE NUMBER OF SHARES IN HUGHES	The General Motors Corporation, the world's No. 1 automaker, said yesterday that it would ask shareholders in June to increase sixfold the number of G.M. Class H shares, which track the Hughes Electronics unit, and then it would split the stock to attract more buyers. G.M. shareholders will be asked to approve the increase to 3.6 billion Class H shares. G.M. directors said they expected to split the stock shortly after the meeting, at a rate to be announced at that time. Hughes runs the DirecTV satellite-television service. G.M. said last month that it would cut its Hughes financial stake by almost half to $18 billion, bowing to shareholder demands to make the unit's stock more widely held and increase the value.
3/4/2000	Stumped, G.M. Recalls Half Its Electric Cars	General Motors has said that half the electric cars it has built have a safety defect and that it does not know if it can fix them. On Thursday the company asked 450 drivers who lease the cars, EV-1's, to return them immediately, and possibly permanently.
3/3/2000	ON STAGE AND OFF	How About McGarden? The Winter Garden Theater won't be changing its name after all. Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the theater, said yesterday that his company had ended discussions with General Motors about changing the name of the Winter Garden, home to ''Cats,'' to the Cadillac Winter Garden, or some variation thereof, in exchange for corporate sponsorship.
3/2/2000	Auto Sales in February Near Monthly Record	The United States auto industry is poised to have its second-best month for sales ever after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported higher vehicle sales for February today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining companies report sales on Thursday. That would put February sales in second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million vehicles.
3/1/2000	A Theater Goes the Way of Arenas, With an Airline Name	Broadway's historic theaters have been named for actors and actresses, playwrights and critics, producers and patrons of the arts. Not until today have any of them been named for airline companies. But in an $8.5 million dollar deal that may well foreshadow the corporate renaming of a host of Broadway houses, the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company is rechristening the venerable Selwyn Theater on 42nd Street the American Airlines Theater.
2/27/2000	Artillery From G.M.'s War Room	IF you think that a Chevy Suburban or Ford Expedition amounts to a tank with cup holders, just wait: General Motors is putting its considerable marketing muscle behind the war-ready Hummer. Within a few years, there is likely to be a whole family of the boxy all-terrain vehicles originally designed for military use. ''We think we can grow the brand,'' G. Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s president, said in an interview this month at the Chicago auto show. ''Younger buyers have an absolute fascination with this look, this image -- 'militaristic' is the word that comes to mind.''
2/27/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Suburban; Still XXXL, but Softer	BY the early 90's, as Chevrolet Suburbans multiplied on American roads, they came to be viewed as symbols of automotive excess. The Suburban had big V-8 power, 18 feet of pressed metal, seats for up to nine and enough room to move a lot of Hillary Clinton's White House mementos up to Chappaqua. Then excess became fashionable and the Suburban, once a favorite of ranchers, road crews and Texans -- who have their own views about personal space -- became something of an extra-large family wagon. There it was on city streets, in cramped parking lots, waiting outside grade schools.
2/26/2000	CARMAKERS TO BUY PARTS ON INTERNET	General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler announced today that they would set up the world's biggest online marketplace for the auto industry's private use, a giant auction site like eBay through which they plan to buy the nearly $250 billion worth of parts and other goods they need each year. The site would dwarf all previous commercial activity on the Web. The automakers said they hoped to cut costs and save time by streamlining their purchasing operations and putting them online. The new system would also help them build more cars to customer specifications by allowing them to order parts for assembly plants far more quickly.
2/26/2000	G.M. WILL TEMPORARILY CLOSE 4 NORTH AMERICAN PLANTS	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest automaker, will temporarily close 4 of its 13 North American car-assembly plants next week to try to reduce inventories of several slow-selling models. The company will close its Saturn plants, in Wilmington, Del., and Spring Hill, Tenn., a spokesman, Tom Wickham, said. It will also halt its Fairfax, Kan., plant which makes the Oldsmobile Intrigue and the Pontiac Grand Prix, and the Ste. Therese, Quebec, plant, which builds the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro. The plants will stop production for one week.
2/20/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Pontiac Bonneville; A Juvenile Show-Off In a Full-Grown Body	FOR better or worse, ''brand management'' is the rage at car companies. The concept -- aiming products at distinct, well-defined target markets -- has thrown Detroit's traditional business model on its ear. Instead of trying to put some sort of Pontiac in every garage, General Motors decides what kind of customers Pontiac should have, asks them what they want and then tries to deliver. And nobody in Detroit has been practicing brand management better than the managers of Pontiac.
2/13/2000	NEW TRUCKS OUT OF LINDEN	General Motors Corporation is building a 24,000-square-foot addition to the body shop of its Linden assembly plant to make way for production of a new four-door pickup. Construction at the site began in December, and the addition is expected to be in operation by early summer. The new model, which was announced last week at the Chicago auto show, will be available in September. The truck, a ''crew cab,'' can accomodate up to five passengers and features four front-hinged doors. David Caldwell, a spokesman for the General Motors truck group, said there were no plans to phase out any of the current models produced at the Linden plant, which employs 2,300, and said there might be a need for new workers there but could not say how many. KRISTEN MARTIN
2/10/2000	A Test Drive on the Green Road Ends in a Brownout	''WHERE are you planning to drive this weekend?'' asked the man at the Budget Rent A Car counter in Los Angeles. He wasn't being nosy. I was about to rent an electric car, which can cover about 120 miles before its nickel metal hydride battery needs to be recharged. And so I would have to plan my itinerary around charging stations -- giant electric outlets scattered in shopping center parking lots and municipal garages. Death Valley wasn't a sensible destination. Luckily, I wasn't planning to go much farther than Malibu, for a friend's 40th birthday party. Although there are no charging stations in Malibu, there are plenty in Santa Monica, a mere 10 miles from my destination. What could possibly go wrong?
2/9/2000	No Humor Impairment Here	I lost my hearing six years ago in November. I went to bed one night -- I had watched ''Seinfeld,'' so I know it was a Thursday night -- and I woke up about 11, nauseated and dizzy, and I couldn't hear, and went to the hospital. Evidently there was a virus that had attacked the cells in my inner ear. I went about a year with no hearing at all. A stenographer who traveled with me would record all conversations and I'd be able to read what was going on. Now I have this technology called a cochlear implant. It is a small wire that is threaded into your inner ear with 22 electrodes. It is attached to an antenna and magnet imbedded in my skull.
2/9/2000	G.M. PENSION FUND REDUCES STAKE IN E.D.S. BY $1.5 BILLION	The General Motors Corporation's largest pension plan will reduce its stake in the Electronic Data Systems Corporation by about $1.5 billion. The G.M. pension fund for hourly employees, E.D.S.'s largest shareholder, will sell 20 million common shares, cutting its stake to 12 percent. E.D.S., the No. 2 United States computer-services company, was bought by G.M. in 1984 and spun off in 1996. The pension plan for G.M., the world's largest automaker, has sold E.D.S. shares periodically. The most recent sale lets the fund benefit from a turnaround that E.D.S.'s chairman and chief executive, Richard Brown, has engineered since taking over 13 months ago.
2/6/2000	Surgical Stitches, in Style	Philip Guarascio, General Motors' vice president in charge of advertising and corporate marketing, is home recovering from triple-bypass surgery last Wednesday. Mr. Guarascio, 58, may not be a household name, but in the advertising world, he looms larger than a Chevrolet Suburban. He decides where General Motors spends its advertising dollars -- 2.1 billion of them in the first three quarters of last year alone, more than any other company.
2/6/2000	Pensions That Get Bigger Than Their Sponsors	In a time of hard-to-explain stock valuations, many investors wonder what makes a company a true value play. One possible answer is this: when the company's pension plan is worth more than its stock market capitalization.
2/3/2000	General Motors Chief to Hand Over Reins to Company's President	John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of General Motors announced today that he would hand his chief executive title and day-to-day responsibility for running the company, the world's largest automaker, to G. Richard Wagoner Jr., 46, the president and chief operating officer, starting in June. Mr. Smith, 61, will serve as the executive chairman. Harry J. Pearce, 57, who is recovering from leukemia, will stay on as G.M.'s vice chairman and may later be tapped to replace Mr. Smith as chairman, people close to the board's deliberations said.
2/2/2000	G.M. Is Said To Choose A New Chief	The General Motors Corporation is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will promote G. Richard Wagoner Jr., its president and chief operating officer, to chief executive as John F. Smith Jr. relinquishes that job but stays on as chairman. The decision came at G.M.'s regularly scheduled board meeting today and is expected to be announced in an employee broadcast Wednesday morning, a person close to the decision said tonight. Harry J. Pearce, the company's vice chairman, will remain in that position, raising the possibility that he might still be named one day to succeed Mr. Smith as G.M. chairman.
2/2/2000	Newest and Trendiest Autos Bring Americans to Dealers	Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles available, automakers said today, as every manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced big gains in sales. The three increases of a quarter percentage point each in short-term interest rates last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on the torrid pace in the auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that the industry this year would nearly match the record-setting pace of 1999.
1/30/2000	Superman, Eat Your Heart Out: X-Ray Vision for the Car	HERE aren't many Sharks or Jets (or Bloods or Crips) in this Catskill Mountain village, but there are street gangs of sorts, wild marauders like the Deer, the Raccoons, the Wild Turkeys. Drive a wooded road at dusk and they dart out, ready to rumble. The larger of them can do serious damage to a car, but they inevitably end up faring the worst in any confrontation with two tons of speeding machinery. Roadside dangers don't end there. There are joggers and cyclists, children chasing balls, motorists changing tires on narrow shoulders. Even the best headlamps have a limited range, and the glare of approaching traffic can momentarily blind any driver.
1/30/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Cadillac DeVille; America's Sumo Shapes Up	IT'S as if Rip Van Winkle awoke to hit the talk-show circuit, run for president and rap on MTV. Cadillac, somnolent for so long, suddenly seems to be everywhere, doing the wildest, craziest things. It revs up a racecar for Le Mans and gives its Catera to Steinmetz Tuning for a high-performance makeover. It shows off a luxury hot-rod called the EldoRODo. Its new ''design & technology'' advertisements are everywhere, even looming over Times Square. At every opportunity, it rolls out its Evoq roadster, a knife-edged design study that foreshadows the look of Cadillacs to come. It trumpets its return to the limousine business it had virtually abandoned. It redesigns its wreath and crest for a high-tech look, shooing away the ducks that had roosted there since 1908, when they displaced the swans of the original '06 emblem.
1/26/2000	Dell, It Turns Out, Has a Better Idea Than Ford	TIME was when Ford Motor's giant River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Mich., was the pinnacle of industrial achievement. Barges of iron ore docked at one end, new Fords rolled out the other. But that was half a century ago, an eternity at Internet speed. Today's model is no longer Ford's assembly line but the quick assembly techniques made famous by Dell Computer. Dell's pioneering methods for making and selling personal computers have become required reading at business schools. Manufacturers in every industry have studied Dell's immense success.
1/23/2000	FIVE QUESTIONS for ROY S. ROBERTS; G.M. Official Gives Sales A Once-Over	FOR decades, General Motors' piece of the United States auto pie has dwindled, to a level that in recent years has raised serious concerns on Wall Street. Despite increased unit sales and a record $6 billion profit in 1999, G.M. ended the year with a market share of 29.45 percent, barely above the 29.40 percent of 1998, when a two-month strike by the United Automobile Workers shut G.M.'s factories, and well below G.M.'s 31.29 percent share in 1997. Roy S. Roberts, 60, the G.M. group vice president for North American vehicle sales, service and marketing, announced last Tuesday that he would retire this spring. A week earlier, during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, he took time to explain some of the factors crimping G.M. sales. Here are excerpts from the conversation. ROBYN MEREDITH
1/21/2000	General Motors Earnings Decline but Still Beat Expectations	Profits fell as sales rose at General Motors in the fourth quarter, when the company ran short of high-margin models and offered discounts to keep sales booming for its less-profitable cars and trucks. Nonetheless, the results were better than Wall Street analysts had expected, driving G.M.'s stock price up 75 cents, to $81.25. And even with a 35 percent drop in fourth-quarter profits, G.M. finished the year with record profits of $6 billion, up from $2.96 billion in 1998.
1/20/2000	Failing Korean Automakers Become Worldwide Quarry	Two South Korean automakers spent the 1990's building costly factories, running them inefficiently and wrecking their balance sheets with enormous debts -- and have now emerged as sought-after acquisition targets in the latest round of consolidation in the global auto industry. At industry conferences here over the last two weeks, American and European executives have repeatedly cited the Daewoo Motor Company and Samsung Motor Inc., both of which are insolvent, as desirable purchases at the right price.
1/19/2000	A Top Official Has Plans to Leave G.M.	Roy S. Roberts, General Motors' group vice president for North American vehicle sales, service and marketing, announced today that he would soon retire, as the company struggles to reverse a decline in its share of the United States vehicle market. Mr. Roberts, who has held his current job for 15 months, set April 1 for his retirement, when he will be 61 years old. G.M. said that his replacement, William J. Lovejoy, currently vice president for auto repair parts and accessories, would be promoted on Feb. 1 to share Mr. Roberts' job during a two-month transition.
1/18/2000	In Policy Shift, G.M. Will Rely On Alliances	In the first acknowledgment by the world's largest corporation that it cannot go it alone, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation said tonight that the company would rely more on partnerships and would better be described as ''the General Motors group.'' ''Our approach is to develop long-term relationships with other companies that offer a unique advantage to the General Motors group of brands and businesses,'' said John F. Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive of G.M., who was speaking at the Automotive News World Congress here. ''This alliance strategy is our major thrust, and it is clearly a different approach to growth than most people have associated with General Motors -- or with the rest of the industry, for that matter.''
1/13/2000	$3.75 Billion Boeing-Hughes Satellite Deal Expected	In a big expansion into the space business, the Boeing Company is expected to announce soon that it is buying the satellite manufacturing business of the Hughes Electronics Corporation for about $3.75 billion in cash, executives close to the matter said today. The transaction would make Boeing the world's largest producer of commercial communications satellites while transforming Hughes almost entirely into an entertainment and communications company, led by its DirecTV satellite television operation.
1/13/2000	G.M. Presses Bid for Daewoo, Vowing to Preserve Its Identity	The General Motors Corporation sought to gain an edge today in the foreign competition to acquire the Daewoo Motor Company, saying it wanted to preserve the ailing South Korean automaker's national identity. The statement by G.M. came against a backdrop of rising concern among Daewoo Motor employees about their fate. Their union has protested what it calls the rushed effort by Daewoo creditors to sell the company to an overseas buyer, and it has scheduled a Jan. 21 meeting to decide whether to strike.
1/12/2000	BRAZILIAN CARS FOR INDIA	The Brazilian subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation reached a deal to sell almost $100 million of automobiles and car parts to India. The transaction illustrates how automakers in Brazil, faced with slumping sales domestically, are offsetting the weakness with exports to other developing countries. As part of the eight-year deal, G.M. will ship several thousand unassembled compact cars and sedans to India each year. Simon Romero
1/11/2000	G.M. Agrees to Purchase Remaining Half of Saab	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would buy the half of Saab Automobile A.B. that it did not already own. The move could bring new customers into the G.M. fold and reduce European production costs. By purchasing the portion owned by the investment company Investor A.B., G.M. would be exercising a buy option it has held since the summer of 1996. G.M. and Investor have shared ownership of the Swedish automaker since 1990, and the latest deal is expected to close by the end of January, when the option was scheduled to expire.
1/2/2000	Another Cover Curse at Time Inc.?	If one bit of history is any guide, you might be wise to avoid Amazon.com stock in 2000. Call it the curse of being named person of the year by Time magazine, which for 1999 picked Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder of Amazon, the money-losing Internet retailer that the market thinks is worth $27 billion.
1/1/2000	Detroit Plays Catch-Up In Race for Hybrid Car; With Fewer Subsidies, Japan Is Ahead	With hundreds of millions of dollars of private and federal research work behind it, the General Motors Precept, an experimental model to be introduced here on Jan. 9, is probably the most expensive single car ever built. Yet it is still a lot of car for the money. In place of side-view mirrors, which cause a lot of wind resistance, it has tiny cameras, mounted on the front doors, that send images to the dashboard. Rather than the smooth, rounded contours commonly associated with aerodynamic design, carefully angled body panels are designed to give the six-passenger Precept far less wind resistance than a Corvette sports car. And instead of a gasoline engine, the car has two electric motors, batteries under the seats and a rear diesel engine to charge the batteries and provide additional power and range.
12/24/1999	G.M. Official Gives Upbeat Review of Year	As the hottest auto market on record winds to a close, a General Motors executive gave an upbeat assessment of 1999 yesterday, a year in which his company has earned record profits even as its market share has declined. G. Richard Wagoner, president of G.M., cited as successes the company's strong profits, peaceful labor relations, new Internet business initiatives, increased unit sales and revised models like the Cadillac DeVille, Pontiac Bonneville, Chevrolet Impala and its Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks. ''On balance, we feel like 1999 was a pretty doggone good year here at General Motors,'' he said.
12/23/1999	G.M. and Ford Expected to Compete for Daewoo Motor	The Daewoo Motor Company became the object of a potential bidding brawl between the world's two largest automakers today after the South Korean government decided to solicit offers instead of negotiate with a single buyer. The government, which is overseeing Daewoo Motor's sale as part of a broader dismantling of the Daewoo Group, the insolvent conglomerate, decided to auction the automaker after the Ford Motor Company expressed interest in buying it. Earlier, the government had indicated it might bargain exclusively with the General Motors Corporation, which said last week that it wanted to buy Daewoo Motor.
12/16/1999	Military Technology to Help You Guide Your Personal Tank	ONE of Superman's most compelling talents was X-ray vision. The Man of Steel could see right through objects to the substance underneath. Now any of his fans who buy Cadillac's new DeVille can experience something similar. Customers can purchase a new DeVille equipped with Night Vision, the first system that allows drivers to see five times as far as they can usually see with headlights -- and even lets them see objects hidden by darkness or obscured by trees. It works by projecting small images of heat-generating objects in a display across the lower part of the windshield, in front of the driver.
12/16/1999	National News Briefs; General Motors Pledges $2.5 Million to MADD	In the midst of the winter holidays, the prime season for drunken drivers, a group that seeks to prevent drunken driving has received a pledge of $2.5 million from General Motors. The pledge to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or MADD, is somewhat unusual because in the past auto makers had been hesitant to remind the public that drunken drivers can be killers. Last year, 15,935 people died and one million were injured in alcohol-related traffic accidents, MADD said.
12/15/1999	G.M. Plans a Rebound From a Bad Month	General Motors is having a bad month. It started Dec. 2 when industry numbers showed that G.M.'s market share had fallen in November to 27.1 percent, a record low for a second consecutive month -- excluding times of strikes or war -- and well below its internal target of 30 percent to 32 percent. It continued when Wall Street analysts turned on the company, saying that the only reason to own G.M. stock is the hope that the company will break itself apart and spin off its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. Then came rumors that America's biggest company would be the subject of a hostile takeover bid. And finally the ultimate insult: some analysts lowered their earnings estimates and suggested investors sell G.M. stock to buy that of its crosstown rival, Ford.
12/15/1999	G.M. Wants Daewoo Motor But Not Its Billions in Debt	The General Motors Corporation today made official its desire to buy the Daewoo Motor Company, but said it was unwilling to assume any of the Korean automaker's $16 billion in debt. A G.M. executive vice president, Louis R. Hughes, who is now in Seoul, delivered a letter of intent containing the company's investment plans to a South Korean committee that represents the domestic creditors of the troubled Daewoo group.
12/14/1999	G.M. Opel Unit Says It's Likely to Pay Nazi-Era Slaves  	The German subsidiary of General Motors said today that it would probably contribute to a fund to compensate forced laborers in the Nazi era, a move that could make G.M. the first American company to accept responsibility for those abuses. The subsidiary, Opel, made its statement as lawyers for the former workers appeared close to a final multibillion-dollar accord with the German government and industry. An accord would safeguard the companies from legal claims.
12/13/1999	G.M. Plans No Slowdown Despite Lagging Sales	Despite slowing sales and bulging inventories of unsold automobiles, the General Motors Corporation announced on Friday that it planned to continue running its North American factories at close to full speed through the first quarter of next year. G.M. said that it planned to build 1,501,000 cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans during January, February and March next year, compared with 1,506,000 during the first three months of this year. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s market analysis director, insisted that the company could sell all the vehicles it planned to make without resorting to the deep discounts that auto makers have traditionally used to clear out dealerships clogged with unwanted models.
12/12/1999	Strike or Strikeout?	If car company publicists ever get together for team bowling, there will be fierce competition to pick Gerry Spahn. Otherwise, they would want Mr. Spahn, Nissan's spokesman on the East Coast, to keep his distance. When Popular Science recently honored recipients of its Best of What's New awards, from the December issue, at a luncheon at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, General Motors set up a display of innovations including what the magazine had called ''dentproof'' urethane truck fenders. To demonstrate, G.M. rigged up a pendulum consisting of a bowling ball, on a steel cable, that could be slammed into the futuristic fender of a prototype Chevy truck.
12/11/1999	G.M. CONFIRMS FUJI DEAL	The world's biggest automaker, the General Motors Corporation, confirmed it would buy a 21.1 percent stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru cars, for about $1.4 billion. Fuji will issue new shares priced at 853 yen apiece, to G.M. under the deal. Stephanie Strom (NYT)
12/10/1999	G.M. Said to Be Ready to Buy Stake in Parent of Subaru	Seeking to help its business at home while building its tiny market share in Asia, the General Motors Corporation is expected to announce that it will pay $1.4 billion for 20 percent of Fuji Heavy Industries, the Japanese maker of Subaru vehicles, people close to the talks said today. The deal, which could be announced as early as Friday, would allow G.M. to share Subaru's expertise in all-wheel-drive systems for small cars, its engineering work on car-based sport utility vehicles and its technology for continuously variable transmissions. In addition, G.M. might tap into Fuji's distribution system in Japan, where G.M. has struggled to sell cars for years.
12/9/1999	General Motors Is Using Buicks to Make Inroads in China	When the chairman of General Motors, John F. Smith Jr., drove the first Buick off an assembly line here a year ago -- after fumbling to find the emergency brake -- it looked like an omen of another American company's hapless foray into China. On Tuesday, a team of Chinese workers fussed over a white Buick minivan -- tightening the bolts, pounding out the kinks and otherwise putting the finishing touches on a vehicle that represents G.M.'s next big bet on the world's most populous nation. This time, it rolled off the line without a hitch.
12/4/1999	G.M. Is Said to Be in Talks To Buy Engines From Honda	The General Motors Corporation appears intent on expanding its relationships with Japanese automakers, and is talking with the Honda Motor Company about a three-way deal in which G.M. would use engines designed by Honda in cars G.M. builds in North America. The negotiations, the second potential deal with a Japanese automaker disclosed this week, also involve Isuzu Motors.
12/3/1999	Japanese Car Maker's Stock Rises on Talk of G.M.'s Buying a Stake	Shares of Fuji Heavy Industries surged 13 percent today after Japan's leading business daily said the company, the maker of Subaru cars, is in the final stages of talks to sell a 20 percent stake to General Motors by year's end. Fuji had twice acknowledged that it was in discussions with G.M., but the detail reported in the paper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, suggested that a deal was imminent. Stock markets here suspended trading in Fuji shares for more than an hour.
12/3/1999	Cars Overtake Light Trucks In November Sales Figures	A surprising jump in car sales allowed Ford Motor to post an unexpectedly strong November, as the industry's sales of cars increased faster than those of high-profit sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans for the first time in nearly three years. Excluding Volvo Cars, which Ford bought last March, Ford's sales rose 4.9 percent last month from a year earlier. That allowed Ford to almost keep pace with the industry, which grew 7.1 percent, as Asian and European automakers prospered while General Motors's sales were flat and DaimlerChrysler's sales edged down.
12/2/1999	G.M. and DaimlerChrysler Report Weak Monthly Sales	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler announced November sales figures today that were weaker than expected as American automakers continued to lose market share to Japanese rivals, who posted big gains. G.M. said its sales in the United States inched up just one-tenth of a percent last month compared with figures in the period a year earlier, several percentage points worse than expected, while DaimlerChrysler said its sales fell 1.3 percent last month, marginally worse than expected. But Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and particularly Nissan Motor all reported large increases, while sales for Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled.
12/1/1999	COMPANY BRIEFS	HP BULMER HOLDINGS P.L.C., Herefordshire, England, the largest cider maker in Britain, agreed to buy Boston-based American Hard Cider Co. for $30.5 million in cash to capture more of the growing United States market.
11/13/1999	G.M. to Take Quarterly Charge	General Motors, the world's largest automaker, will take a $444 million fourth-quarter charge to reflect the increased retiree pension costs of the contract it reached with the United Automobile Workers in September. G.M. agreed to raise wages of about 150,000 hourly workers by 3 percent in each of the next four years and pay each a $1,350 signing bonus. It also agreed to raise future pension benefits of current U.A.W. members and to pay three lump sums to U.A.W. retirees. Those lump sums required the $444 million charge.
11/12/1999	Cadillac is redesigning its image before its retooled cars appear.	CADILLAC has worked through an identity crisis and come up with a sharpened brand image and radical designs for the cars in its future. But years before any of the futuristic cars have rolled out of factories, the flagship division of General Motors plans an ad campaign promoting its new image. Cadillac will start advertising the sizzle without the steak on Monday. Marketing experts are divided about whether its approach will work.
11/7/1999	Can G.M. Return to the Passing Lane?	A JOKE making the rounds of car dealers offers this solution to America's drug problem: ''Turn the marketing over to G.M. and demand will go away.'' The chief executive of one auto maker said he no longer bothered to pay attention to G.M. And John P. Wolkonowicz, an industry consultant at Buhlin Group, summed it up this way: ''They've fallen and they can't get up.''
11/7/1999	Making Alterations For the New Dow 30	An overhaul of the Dow Jones industrial average was completed last week, but it caused barely a murmur in the mutual fund universe. After all, very few funds explicitly track that venerable benchmark, which on Monday dropped four issues -- Union Carbide, Goodyear, Chevron and Sears, Roebuck -- while adding four standard-bearers of the new economy -- Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot and SBC Communications. But the makeover meant a lot to Richard Moroney, co-manager of the $110 million Strong Dow 30 Value fund. It indexes half of its portfolio to the Dow, then uses various Dow valuation theories to weight the other half, which also holds only Dow stocks.
11/4/1999	G.M. to Offer a New Reason To Keep the Cell Phone On	For drivers not already talking on their cellular phones, the General Motors Corporation plans to introduce a new service sometime next year, one that will let them surf the Internet from a car. The service will be offered as an addition to the Onstar cellular phone and navigation system, which is already used by 94,000 owners of luxury G.M. cars and sport utility vehicles. To reduce the safety risks that might come from distracted drivers, no computer screens will be used for the new service.
11/3/1999	Foreign Nameplate Autos Are Sales Favorites in U.S.	Buyers snapped up cars and trucks with foreign nameplates last month, forsaking some of their past favorites -- American-made sport utility vehicles. Nearly every foreign brand reporting sales results today showed increases, and many notched double-digit gains. Toyota sales rose 12.6 percent in October compared to the same period a year ago. Honda sales rose 3.2 percent and Nissan jumped 27.6 percent.
11/2/1999	G.M. Director Who Led '92 Management Shake-Up Sets Retirement	John G. Smale, the director who led a rare management coup at General Motors seven years ago this month, plans to retire in May, a G.M. spokesman said today. The man Mr. Smale and the G.M. board installed as chief executive back then, John F. Smith Jr., is likely to retire at the same time after seven grueling years at the helm, according to board members and others close to the company.
10/30/1999	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Cracks in Canada's Glass Ceiling; Women Get Some Top Posts, but Few Boardroom Keys	In the early 1990's, Barbara G. Stymiest, a partner at the accounting firm Ernst & Young here, was irritated to discover that her Toronto golf club reserved Saturday morning tee times for men, on the assumption that wives could play all week long. But that golf rule has long ago been changed, and Ms. Stymiest has just become president of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
10/26/1999	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: A Lopez in Every Garage; Former G.M. and VW Executive Wants His Own Factory	Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has long dreamed of building a car factory here in his Basque hometown. But that dream caused him, by his own reckoning, to commit the biggest mistake of his life. The mistake, he said, was defecting in 1993 from the executive suite at General Motors, which declined to build the advanced, cost-efficient plant he envisioned, and joining Volkswagen, which he said promised to build it but never did.
10/22/1999	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Design; G.M. Offers a Sneak Preview of Its Cars of Tomorrow	DETERMINED not to be a wallflower at next year's big parties, General Motors is trying on a rack of new outfits in an effort to bedazzle those who haven't been asking for a dance. In a move unprecedented in the auto industry, G.M. gave the press a peek last week at nine so-called concept vehicles that it will display at the industry's equivalent of debutante balls, the auto shows in Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago and Geneva in the first half of next year. And next week, G.M. will give journalists a preview of its glitzy display for the North American International Auto Show on Jan. 15-23 in Detroit.
10/20/1999	Separating the Chirp From the Ping, Unless It's a Grunch	SO your car is making a noise that's driving you crazy, but, of course, it puts on the silent treatment when the service technician tries to check it on a drive around the block. ''It sounds like a chirp,'' you insist. ''Or maybe a squeak or a squeal. And sometimes there's a chuckle, a kind of chattering sort of sound.'' By now the technician is rolling his eyes. ''I don't know from chuckle,'' he says. ''Maybe there's a comedian in your trunk.''
10/20/1999	G.M. and Canadian Union Reach Tentative Agreement	Dodging a threatened strike, the General Motors Corporation reached a tentative contract agreement tonight with the Canadian Auto Workers union that will provide generous raises to the company's 21,000 Canadian factory workers even as it allows the company to continue to downsize. ''It is an excellent agreement,'' said Basil E. Hargrove, the union's president. ''It recognizes the contribution our workers have made to General Motors' profits.''
10/20/1999	Vehicles So Much Alike They're Actually the Same	THERE'S a hard way and an easy way of creating a new car model. Here's the easy way: take something you've already built, or that somebody else has already built, and give it a new name. This is called rebadging, or badge engineering, and it's why you can find, for instance, virtually identical sport utility vehicles for sale as the Chevrolet Blazer, the GMC Jimmy and the Oldsmobile Bravada. It's also why you can find Isuzu Troopers on Honda lots, where they're called Passports.
10/15/1999	CANADIAN AUTO PACT THREATENED	The World Trade Organization has ruled in an interim decision that a Canadian law permitting the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler to import vehicles into Canada without paying duty violates fair trade practices. Japan and the European Union had challenged the 1956 law because Canada imposes a 6.5 percent import duty on other car makers. The final ruling is due on Nov. 25, but it can be appealed. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
10/15/1999	G.M. Reports Turnaround On Earnings in 3d Quarter	Demand for pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans helped the General Motors Corporation earn $877 million in the third quarter, a significant turnaround from a $309 million loss in the period a year eariler. The loss was caused by an expensive strike in the summer of 1998. Excluding the impact of the strike, G.M.'s net income rose 34 percent in the third quarter compared with the period a year earlier, on revenue of $42.8 billion. All figures have been adjusted to reflect G.M.'s spinoff in May of its giant auto-parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems Inc.
10/14/1999	G.M. AND DAEWOO DISCUSS LINK	The world's biggest auto maker, the General Motors Corporation, is continuing exclusive talks with the Daewoo Motor Company of South Korea about a possible strategic tie-up. The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding in August to begin talks on a possible partnership, which some analysts say could result in G.M.'s takeover of Daewoo Motor. This week, a delegation of G.M. executives, headed by Louis R. Hughes, vice president for new business strategies, arrived in Seoul to hold talks with Daewoo officials. Samuel Len
10/14/1999	G.M. Meets With Dealers	The General Motors Corporation said today in a joint statement with the National Automobile Dealers Association that it would move cautiously on its plans to develop a new unit that would acquire United States dealerships and said it wanted to include independent dealers as partners in franchises it acquires. The statement was released by G.M. after a meeting between its chairman, John F. Smith Jr., and the chairman of the dealer association, James Willingham, and several other top association officials.
10/13/1999	Fight Is Promised Over G.M. Plan to Buy Dealerships	The president of the National Automobile Dealers Association, one of the nation's wealthiest and most powerful business lobbying groups, bitterly criticized the General Motors Corporation today for its plan to buy 5 percent to 10 percent of its dealerships and operate them itself. He hinted that dealers might try to use their political influence to stop the company. The criticism set the stage not only for a fight over how automobiles are sold in the United States but also over the development of electronic commerce and the Internet. G.M. and other auto makers have been trying to market vehicles over the Internet, but dealers have been blocking many of those initiatives, using state franchise laws that require that all vehicles be sold through dealerships.
10/10/1999	Rara Avis at G.M.: A Director From Japan	When Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's chief executive, was named to the board of General Motors last week, he joined only a handful of other Asian executives who are directors of United States companies. Among the few are Goro Watanabe, vice chairman of Mitsui Chemicals, who serves on DuPont's board, and Minoru Makihara, chairman of Mitsubishi, who is on I.B.M.'s. Despite all the corporate talk of globalization, big business often leaves its multinationalism at the board-room door.
10/7/1999	Union Pacific Gives Big Lift To G.M. Unit	The Union Pacific Corporation said today that it had ordered 1,000 locomotives worth more than $2 billion from a Canadian division of the General Motors Corporation. It was Union Pacific's biggest step yet to improve a railroad network that was so slow and snarled two years ago that some customers rebelled and began sending freight by truck. The General Motors Electro-Motive Division in London, Ontario, about 150 miles southwest of Toronto, will deliver the new locomotives over the next four years. It is the largest single order for locomotives ever placed by the Omaha-based railroad, and the largest piece of business ever won by the Canadian manufacturer.
10/2/1999	Auto Makers Finish Record Year on Strong Note	Customers drawn by hefty rebates bought more than 16 million new cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in the 1999 model year, breaking the sales record set in 1986. ''These are good times,'' said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president for sales, service and marketing for the General Motors Corporation, which had its best model-year results in a decade. ''The combination of affordable vehicles, high employment and buying momentum continues to propel us to record levels.''
9/30/1999	G.M. Announces Fuel-Cell Breakthrough	The General Motors Corporation announced today that it had developed a fuel cell that can be chilled to 4 degrees below zero and still start, a key step for using fuel cells in cars. Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to form electric current and water, with high efficiency and no pollution. But if the water freezes and expands, it could break seals or membranes or other crucial parts, engineers said. ''We've overcome that, and that's a big deal,'' said Andrew H. Card Jr., head of government relations for the company.
9/29/1999	G.M. Agrees To 4-Year Pact With Union	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union reached agreement on a new, four-year labor contract late tonight that would give the company's 143,200 factory workers annual raises of 3 percent plus adjustments for inflation. The union and the company jointly announced the agreement, but declined to comment further.
9/27/1999	General Motors and Union Negotiators Said to Be Close to 4-Year Agreement	General Motors and the United Automobile Workers hope to reach a new, four-year labor contract within the next several days as the relationship between the world's largest company and its main union appears to have improved considerably since last year's 54-day strike in Flint, Mich., auto industry and union officials said today. A G.M. official close to the talks said, ''They're making progress; they met until very late last night.''
9/26/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL /2000 Saturn L-Series; Bigger Space Stations in Saturn's Orbit	THE Saturn Corporation started as a grand experiment by General Motors to make and sell cars in innovative ways. But while Japanese manufacturers roll out all-new models every four years or so, Saturn has made do for a decade with the same basic car. Not only that, Saturn has been confined to a small-car market that is fiercely competitive and rapidly shrinking. Finally, the wait for a new product is over. The L-Series line, which went on sale this summer, doubles Saturn's offerings and puts it into the midsize segment, the largest part of the auto market.
9/25/1999	G.M. to Lift Texas Output	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would build its next-generation, full-size sports utility vehicles at its truck assembly plant in Arlington, Tex. G.M. said it would increase its investment in the plant by $70 million , to about $500 million, raising its capacity by 50 percent. The plant will begin making Chevrolet Tahoes and GMC Yukons in the second half of next year.
9/24/1999	G.M. AND UNION ARE SAID TO BE NEAR A CONTRACT	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union hope to conclude a new labor contract as soon as Sunday or Monday, several people close to the talks said yesterday. The contract is likely to resemble closely the union's agreement last week with DaimlerChrysler A.G., they said, adding that Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, had been personally leading the talks this week at a G.M. office building in Michigan. A peaceful agreement would be an accomplishment for G.M., which has endured crippling strikes, including an eight-week walkout a year ago in Flint, Mich., that cost the company $2 billion in after-tax profits.
9/23/1999	General Motors is significantly increasing its efforts to aim pitches at black consumers.	GENERAL MOTORS, the nation's largest advertiser, is significantly increasing efforts to aim sales pitches at black consumers. G. M., which spent $2.1 billion on American advertising last year, has signed an agreement with BET Holdings Inc. in Washington, owner of media properties that include the Black Entertainment Television cable network, Emerge and Heart & Soul magazines and BET Weekend, a Sunday newspaper supplement.
9/21/1999	Possible Rift For Detroit In Labor Pact	DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s tentative contract with the United Automobile Workers contains company concessions that may create problems when the union demands similar concessions next from General Motors and Ford. DaimlerChrysler agreed in the contract to hire more employees if the work force at any factory complex falls by more than 5 percent during the four-year contract for any reason except a downturn in automobile sales.
9/18/1999	Ford Facing Unrest in U.S. And Canada	After enjoying the best labor relations in the auto industry for a generation, the Ford Motor Company is likely to face a strike next week in Canada and heavy pressure in the United States from the United Automobile Workers union. Auto labor leaders on both sides of the border have been emboldened by the rich contract that the U.A.W. tentatively reached on Thursday with DaimlerChrysler A.G. The four-year contract revived a practice from the union's glory days of the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's by calling for annual wage increases of 3 percent in addition to cost-of-living adjustments that almost match the rate of inflation.
9/17/1999	DaimlerChrysler And Auto Union In Tentative Deal; One U.A.W. Local Official Calls Deal 'a Great Package'	Paving the way for contracts covering the nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers, the United Automobile Workers union and DaimlerChrysler A.G. this morning reached tentative agreement on a four-year pact calling for a $1,350 signing bonus and pay increases of 3 percent a year on top of adjustments for inflation. If workers ratify the deal later this month, as expected, they will also get heftier pension benefits and additional job security, even as the company is allowed to continue downsizing through attrition, according to local union officials. Under the current contract, auto workers have earned between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, depending on the amount of overtime they work and the level of corporate profits.
9/17/1999	Cadillac Has a Date for the Prom	FOR several years, the rear-drive Lincoln Town Car has had the limousine business pretty much to itself. That is changing: Last week, the nation's largest privately owned limousine operator, Dav El Chauffeured Transportation Network, said it was ending a 35-year run with Lincoln to switch to the front-drive Cadillac DeVille. Scott A. Solombrino, chief executive of Dav El, said he was initially ordering 250 DeVille stretch limousines, like the 2000 prototype above, and 250 luxury sedans. He said that during the next three years Dav El, of Chelsea, Mass., would replace nearly 9,000 of its 11,000 vehicles worldwide with Cadillacs or other General Motors products. John Smith, Cadillac's marketing general manager, said the DeVille was redesigned with the limousine industry in mind from the start.
9/16/1999	Auto Industry's Contract Talks Continue	Negotiators for the United Automobile Workers and DaimlerChrysler A.G. continued their round-the-clock labor talks today after indefinitely extending their current contract, which was to expire at midnight on Tuesday. Three-year contracts with General Motors and Ford Motor were also scheduled to expire at midnight on Tuesday, and talks continued with those companies, too. The union was expected to reach an agreement with DaimlerChrysler first. In a sign that talks were progressing, the union stopped five wildcat strikes that broke out on Tuesday.
9/15/1999	Auto Makers Granted Extensions As Labor Negotiations Continue	As labor talks covering the nation's 400,000 auto workers continued past the midnight expiration of current labor contracts, the United Automobile Workers union granted contract extensions that allowed auto factories to keep humming without interrupting this year's record auto sales. Late Tuesday, the union extended the Ford Motor Company contract for an indefinite time. Then it extended its contract with the General Motors Corporation. Finally, minutes before midnight, the union granted an extension to the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, the company closest to reaching an agreement with the union. That wasn't soon enough to stop wildcat strikes at DaimlerChrysler, which came as the union continued to put pressure on the company in the hours before the midnight deadline. In St. Louis, 2,800 workers building highly profitable Dodge Ram pickups walked off the job around 8:45 P.M., along with 4,400 workers building the company's bread-and-butter minivans, according to David Barnas, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman. An hour later in Kokomo, Ind., about 8,400 workers building transmissions and auto parts, walked off the job. Components built in those factories are used by some of the company's biggest money makers, its four-wheel drive sport utility vehicles. It is unclear whether the morning shift will report to work at those factories. A deal is expected first at DaimlerChrysler and is likely to call for raises of at least 3 percent annually for the next three or four years, for increased pension benefits and for strengthened job security measures for workers, according to labor and industry executives. Union and company officials have refused to disclose details of the talks. The union typically reaches a deal with one of the companies then insists the other two accept similar terms.
9/15/1999	It's a Hybrid In Sport Utility Clothes; A Car-Based Light Truck, It Obeys the Fuel Rules, and It Helps Make Money	Scheduled to go on sale next spring, the Chrysler PT Cruiser is not quite a sport utility vehicle and not really a minivan. It does not look like a conventional car, either, although it uses much the same underbody and even a few of the same parts as the Dodge Neon, which is definitely a car.
9/14/1999	Agreement In Auto Talks Seems Closer	With the auto industry fat and happy, and both labor and management eager to keep it that way, the United Automobile Workers union moved closer to agreeing to new labor contracts with both DaimlerChrysler and the General Motors Corporation. The auto industry's three-year labor contracts covering nearly 400,000 factory workers expire at midnight on Tuesday, and with that deadline fast approaching, talks between the union and the two companies continued through the weekend and today. If no deal is reached on Tuesday, the union is likely to extend the talks rather than call a strike, labor experts said.
9/14/1999	Metro Business; CIT Buys Locomotives	CIT Group Inc. of Livingston, N.J., said yesterday that it would buy 90 locomotives from General Motors Corporation as it expands its leasing fleet to include new trains. The Electro-Motive division of G.M., one of the biggest locomotive manufacturers, will begin shipping the new locomotives in the fourth quarter. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
9/12/1999	FIVE QUESTIONS for HARLEY S. SHAIKEN; Paradoxes Of G.M.'s Promise	A FEW short years ago, many working Americans worried about the seemingly constant downsizings by major corporations, and there was much hand-wringing about whether anyone could expect to join a company fresh from school and work there long enough to retire with a gold watch. In board rooms, the worry was the opposite: that decades of steady gains by unions on job security and work-rule issues in the prosperous 1950's and 60's had made the labor force in many American factories too expensive and inflexible to compete in the global economy, especially during recessions. The long economic expansion of the 1990's has created so many new jobs that downsizing has lost its capacity to terrify most workers, and young people joining the work force often tell survey takers that they don't expect to stay at one company for a decade, never mind a career.
9/11/1999	Auto Workers Try to Wring DaimlerChrysler Concessions	Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, is demanding that DaimlerChrysler A.G. make it easier for the union to organize workers at its plants as a condition of leading industry contract talks, U.A.W. officials said. Mr. Yokich spent the last two days pressing DaimlerChrysler to go beyond a simple promise to remain neutral in U.A.W. campaigns, the officials said. The union is seeking access to employee lists and to factory floors, pledges that plants will not be shut down if the union wins and simpler election procedures.
9/9/1999	Auto Workers Choose Ford For Canada Contract Talks	The Ford Motor Company will be the pattern-setting company in labor negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, the union announced today. ''We will get a good settlement,'' Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said. ''It is time working people in our nation got a pay raise.''
9/6/1999	G.M. Offers Some Workers In Auto Union Jobs for Life	The General Motors Corporation has offered the United Automobile Workers union lifetime employment guarantees for many current workers as it negotiates a new contract, a G.M. spokesman confirmed today. G.M., along with DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Ford Motor Company, faces the expiration of its three-year contract with unionized workers on Sept. 14. In the expiring contract, workers effectively have lifetime employment because the terms bar auto makers allowing employment to fall by more than 5 percent nationally or in any of a dozen regions.
9/2/1999	Auto Sales Rose Sharply In August	In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced today that their sales soared in August, with the biggest growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the highest profits. DaimlerChrysler A.G. said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States with a 2.8 percent increase.
8/30/1999	Corrections	The Advertising column in Business Day on Friday, about efforts to update Cadillac's image, misstated the ownership of Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising spending. It is a unit of VNU, not of R. C. Auletta & Company.
8/29/1999	And If You'd Rather Have a Used Impala . . .	MENTION ''Impala,'' and people of a certain age get wistful. Add ''Super Sport'' and you're likely to hear tales of youth misspent at the wheel, under the hood, in the back seat. The memories are free, but parking a genuine old Impala in the garage will cost you, although many collector car experts say full-size Chevys of the 1960's are relatively well-priced. They are also abundant -- eight million were sold in that decade -- and thus ubiquitous at old-car shows and in the classified ads of collector publications.
8/29/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2000 Chevrolet Impala; Apple Pie Without the Spice	OF all the symbols of the 60's -- peace sign, marijuana leaf, electric guitar -- the one that came closest to home for many Americans was a stylized antelope leaping over a chrome hoop. It was affixed to some 8 million Chevrolet Impalas in that decade, out of a phenomenal 1958-85 production run of 13 million. Countless baby boomers came of age in that full-size Chevy, which melded power, pizazz and patriotism -- think of Dinah Shore and commercials for ''baseball, hot dogs and Chevrolet'' -- with old-fashioned value. The line included the right car for just about anybody -- muscular Super Sports for high school hot-rodders, sedate sedans for Gramps and Grandma, family wagons that were the minivans of the day.
8/27/1999	What is that, Batman, on your new Cadillac? Why, art and science.	BACK in the 1950's and 60's, Cadillac built cars with all-American swagger. People aspired to get behind the wheel of a Cadillac with yards of chrome and soaring tailfins. But Cadillac has a problem: those same people are almost the only ones still willing to be seen driving a Caddy. For several years, Cadillac has been struggling to update its image and its lineup. Today, it is scheduled to introduce a badge for its future cars and trucks. The badge, a stylized, sleeker version of its traditional wreath-and-crest design, is a symbol of Cadillac's effort to remake itself while clinging to its prestigious heritage.
8/26/1999	G.M.-DAEWOO TALKS ADVANCE	The world's biggest auto maker, the General Motors Corporation, took its first step toward an alliance with the car-making affiliate of the debt-ridden Daewoo Group of South Korea. A 20-member G.M. fact-finding mission has begun assessing Daewoo Motor, G.M.'s Seoul office said. The visit is the first direct contact between Daewoo and G.M. since the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this month that could lead to G.M. management control of Daewoo's auto business. Samuel Len
8/25/1999	Ford's Labor Relations Are on Edge as G.M.'s Relax	After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Company is facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor relations at the General Motors Corporation are finally starting to improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials and auto executives say. The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said. The U.A.W. conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation, which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler A.G.
8/18/1999	Hoping for Repeat Success, Auto Makers Build a Hybrid	Pickup trucks are popular and auto makers cannot build sport utility vehicles fast enough, so three auto makers have separately come to the same conclusion: it is time to start building sport utility pickups. At an annual convention here to show dealers the offerings for the new model year, the Ford Motor Company introduced the Explorer Sport Trac, to go on sale in January. Like similar vehicles planned for next year by the General Motors Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company, the Sport Trac has the passenger compartment of a four-door sport utility vehicle but also has a short, open truck bed in back.
8/15/1999	Shifting Gear To Computers	Silicon Valley visited the rust belt this week, when Scott G. McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems, showed up at a press conference that General Motors called to tout its new Internet unit, e-GM. Sun is handling all of G.M.'s Web sites and otherwise helping the auto giant get connected. Mr. McNealy, who grew up in the land of navy suits, as the Detroit area is often known -- his father was vice chairman of AMC Motors -- showed up wearing faded jeans. Several G.M. executives, straining for casual, had taken off their ties and changed into sport coats for the occasion. Mr. McNealy insisted that they were committed to the wired world, appearances aside. ''You wouldn't know it by looking at them,'' he said. ''I see no body piercing, no tattoos.''
8/12/1999	Economic Scene; The ins and outs of putting a price tag on product safety.	WE'RE just like numbers,'' one juror said last month after voting to order the General Motors Corporation to pay $4.9 billion to six people severely burned when the fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded after a drunken driver ran into them. The award is an understandably human reaction to evidence introduced during the trial that purported to show that General Motors had a policy of forgoing safety features that cost shockingly little, perhaps no more than $2.40 a car. Yet the award is outrageously high -- it is perhaps the largest award ever in a personal-injury lawsuit, imposing $4.8 billion of punitive damages. It will probably be set aside or at least greatly reduced, when, as expected, G.M. appeals.
8/11/1999	G.M. Toiling at Full Speed But Says It's Gaining Little	Executives of the General Motors Corporation acknowledged today that the company would be unable to increase its share of the booming auto market soon. They also announced that the company would bundle its Internet-related assets together in a single unit called e-GM. The giant auto maker has watched its market share slide for decades, but as recently as last month executives had vowed to regain the 30 percent level. Instead, its share of the market sank to 28.4 percent in July. Today, executives said that G.M.'s factories were building as many cars and trucks as possible and that G.M. could not produce enough vehicles to increase its market share as long as customers continued to buy them at a pace of 17 million a year.
8/10/1999	U.A.W. Official's Death Puts Labor-Contract Focus on Ford	The unexpected death of a labor leader over the weekend makes it likely that the Ford Motor Company will be the lead company in labor negotiations covering the auto industry's 405,000 blue-collar workers. Jack Laskowski, a vice president of the United Automobile Workers union, died on Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, the union said today. Mr. Laskowski, 59, led the labor team negotiating with DaimlerChrysler A. G.
8/8/1999	Look, Ma, No Fins!	Cadillac has taken the wraps off its 2000 DeVille, which goes on sale next month. Breaking a 50-year tradition, the rear bears only the faintest suggestion of the tailfins that made their debut on 1948 Cadillacs, a year before the Coupe de Ville was born. The new design is a bridge between the DeVille's recent corpulence and a sharp-edged, high-tech look yet to come. The first Cadillac Coupe de Ville, of 1949.
8/7/1999	G.M. and Daewoo Sign Deal That May Lead to Alliance	The General Motors Corporation today signed an agreement that could lead to an alliance with the Daewoo Motor Company, the core of South Korea's struggling Daewoo Group. G.M., the world's largest auto maker, could end up buying assets from Daewoo or taking a stake in the company, possibly even a controlling stake, said Alan G. Perriton, president of General Motors Korea and head of new business ventures and strategic alliances in the Asia-Pacific region.
8/7/1999	AVIATION VENTURE WITH DAIMLERCHRYSLER IS SOUGHT	Aviation units from the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler A.G. said yesterday that they were seeking approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for a joint venture in the charter aviation business. The new company, based in Pontiac, Mich., would offer charter service to destinations worldwide, the companies said in a statement. The venture would link General Motors Air Transportation Services with DaimlerChrysler Aviation. About 20 planes will be available for charter use. The venture ''allows us to reduce operational costs while not impacting existing air travel services for our employees, which remains a priority for G.M.,'' said Kenneth Emerick, G.M. travel director.
8/4/1999	Strong July and Rebates Position Auto Makers for Record Year	Auto makers dangled rebates in front of their customers last month, and like fish to bait, buyers snapped up new cars and trucks. That led to a brisk annual sales pace of 17 million vehicles and kept the industry on track for a record-setting sales year. The General Motors Corporation, which was virtually shut down by a strike in June and July last year, saw its sales jump 62.6 percent in July compared with figures in the bleak period a year earlier. Car sales jumped 68.2 percent, while sales of minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose 57.2 percent. Part of the sales increase was a result of generous rebates and discounted financing deals that G.M. began offering on July 15 on nearly every 1999 model. The deals are good through September.
8/4/1999	Even a Sky Can Have Limits; Financing and Other Problems Crimp Space Industry's Growth	The promise of the space business was shown recently when Hughes Electronics announced a $1.5 billion investment from America Online to deliver Internet service via satellite. The pitfalls of the space business were seen the same day when Hughes disclosed, much more quietly, problems in manufacturing satellites that would require it to write off $125 million and take a big quarterly loss.
8/1/1999	A Bonding Fest for Saturn Owners	IF America's streets and highways seemed devoid of Saturns on Friday and Saturday, it was because tens of thousands of the cars were converging on sleepy Spring Hill, Tenn., with headlights shining and horns honking. The owners attended a two-day festival orchestrated by Saturn, the General Motors unit, which called the event a ''homecoming'' because the cars are built at a sprawling factory there.
7/30/1999	Auto Union In New Push In Canada	The Canadian Auto Workers union is applying extra muscle at contract-bargaining time to pressure the Big Three auto makers into helping the union organize employees at Magna International Inc., one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers. Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove, the Canadian auto union president, put Magna on the agenda last week in the opening contract talks with DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc., General Motors of Canada Ltd. and the Ford Motor Company of Canada. The auto makers and the union are seeking a new contract before the current one expires on Sept. 21.
7/22/1999	G.M. Admits Brake Flaws After Inquiry	After a five-year Federal investigation, General Motors acknowledged today that the anti-lock brakes on 3.6 million sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and full-size vans would be slow to stop the vehicles under certain circumstances. Owners of those vehicles will be asked to take them to dealerships for brake repairs during the coming months.
7/21/1999	G.M. Profit Beats Wall Street Expectations	Pocketing higher profits even as its market share continues to erode, the General Motors Corporation said today that it earned $1.73 billion in the second quarter, a vast improvement over the $306 million it earned from continuing operations during the same period last year, when there was a costly strike. ''Everything went right during the quarter,'' said David B. Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham Securities. ''It represents the best G.M. can do given the way the company is laid out these days.''
7/21/1999	Smokers Are Both Used and Abused	To the Editor: Re ''Looking for Attention With a Billion-Dollar Message'' (Week in Review, July 18):
7/19/1999	Corrections	An article on July 10 about a $4.9 billion award in a personal injury lawsuit against General Motors used an incorrect given name in some editions for a University of Southern California law professor who commented on the amount. He is Greg Keating, not Gary. The article also gave an erroneous example of General Motors' A-body cars, the type of vehicle that was involved in the crash that was the subject of the lawsuit. The Pontiac Grand Prix is an A-body car; the Grand Am is not.
7/19/1999	Marketers Set Test Of TV-Internet Link	Four large marketers said they would take part in a large study measuring the effect of a new technology on television viewing and Internet use. The participants in the study, commissioned by Worldgate Communications in Trevose, Pa., and conducted by Nielsen Media Research, are General Motors, the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies, Sprint and Warner-Lambert. The study, covering 1,000 households in Ohio, will test the effects of channel hyperlinking technology, which enables TV viewers to use the Internet through links tied to the programs they see.
7/15/1999	Lincoln wants to pull in a younger market for its new car, but hopes to avoid Cadillac's mistakes.	WHEN American car lovers thought of luxury cars years ago long before Lexus came along to steal boomers' hearts from BMW, which had won them over from Mercedes-Benz -- they envisioned Cadillacs and Lincolns. Now, Lincoln is embarking on a new campaign trying to make it so again, though with a twist: it has designed a car that looks and drives like a European or Japanese sport sedan, and it plans to advertise it with scenes that could easily have been shot in Europe. The ads for the model, though, proclaim, ''American Luxury.''
7/12/1999	Paper Trail Haunts G.M. After It Loses Injury Suit	The $4.9 billion verdict in a personal-injury lawsuit against General Motors on Friday might be only the start of the company's problems. Lawyers and safety consultants pursuing similar cases say corporate documents used as evidence in the case, many for the first time, could be troublesome for General Motors in the future. The jury here awarded the record-setting damages to six people who were badly burned when the gas tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded after the car was rammed from behind by another vehicle. The plaintiffs have pledged to donate half of any punitive damages they collect after taxes to the state of California to pay for the care and treatment of burn victims, their lawyer, Brian J. Panish, said today.
7/10/1999	$4.9 Billion Jury Verdict In G.M. Fuel Tank Case	In what is believed to be the largest award ever in a personal-injury lawsuit, the General Motors Corporation was ordered today to pay $4.9 billion to six people severely burned when the fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded after a rear-end collision. The verdict was reached by 12 jurors in state court here after a 10-week trial in which the accident victims had produced some evidence purporting to show that General Motors had known the car's design was unsafe but had not changed it because of the cost.
7/8/1999	G.M. Internet Sales Hit Snag in Texas	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker, has been denied a license to sell used cars directly to Houston customers through the Internet because Texas does not let manufacturers own or control dealerships. G.M.'s Driversite program was denied a license to transfer titles for used vehicles in a June 29 letter from the Texas motor vehicles division to Ross Hendrix, G.M.'s director of used-car retail operations. The denial was reported in Automotive News, a weekly trade publication.
7/7/1999	Auto Industry Focuses Talks On Health Care	The soaring cost of prescription drugs for aging auto workers and retirees is the top health care issue in national labor talks pitting the United Automobile Workers union against General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler A.G., auto executives said. While many industries face rising costs for pharmaceutical benefits, the auto makers said they had particularly acute problems. Benefits consultants, who compare costs in various industries, agree.
7/3/1999	G.M. and Ford Report Gains In June Car and Truck Sales	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company reported today that their car and truck sales edged higher last month as the entire auto industry recorded its best June in history and its second-best month ever. Industry sales of cars and light trucks totaled 1.6 million vehicles last month, a 2 percent increase over the blistering sales pace of a year ago. That put the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate at 17 million vehicles -- 9 million cars and 8 million trucks, according to Ward's Communications, a Detroit publisher.
6/28/1999	A Different Breed of Saturn	The car company that grew up by pretending it did not know its parent company, the General Motors Corporation, is starting a family of its own. Saturn, the small-car brand that G.M. created a decade ago to win back baby boomers from imports, will begin selling a midsize car in July. About two years later, it plans to add a small sport utility vehicle.
6/25/1999	AUTOS ON FRIDAY /Safety; G.M. Develops Sensor To Make Trunks Safer	AFTER 11 children died last summer in separate incidents in which they became trapped in car trunks, General Motors and other companies set out to design a release inside the trunk. They did, and G.M., which developed a big yellow handle that is illuminated when the trunk is closed, made a $50 kit including the handle available at its dealerships. But G.M. said immediately that the handle was not perfect: In tests, some children did not figure out that pulling it would let them escape. So the company developed an infrared sensor that detects a person or a pet by recognizing motion or body heat. It automatically pops the trunk, using the existing mechanism that opens the lid from a switch near the driver or from a key fob.
6/24/1999	PUBLIC LIVES	The Tea Party Becomes Trendy The tea party is making a comeback, spontaneously it seems.
6/18/1999	Ford Raises Productivity At Its Plants	The big difference in labor productivity between American and Japanese auto makers in the 1980's, then a matter of considerable dismay in the United States, has been sharply reduced by Ford, but General Motors and DaimlerChrysler still lag, according to a comprehensive study released today. Two decades ago, Japanese car makers enjoyed a labor cost advantage of roughly $1,000 a vehicle, adjusted for inflation, according to Harbour & Associates, a manufacturing-consultant in Troy, Mich., which published its annual productivity report today. The labor cost difference has persisted for G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, which have only improved as quickly as the Japanese makers.
6/16/1999	A 10-Year Bet On Ken Burns	Contortions of envy may well ripple through the documentary filmmakers' world tomorrow. That is when General Motors plans to announce an unusual 10-year commitment to underwrite the future film projects of Ken Burns. General Motors has been the sole corporate underwriter for Mr. Burns's earlier films, like ''The Civil War,'' ''Baseball'' and one coming out in the fall, ''Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.''
6/13/1999	How Blue Is Your Collar	IN her mid-30's and in mid-career, Solange de Santis, a business reporter with an Ivy League education and a crisp white-collar upbringing, became an auto worker. As Ms. de Santis writes in her engaging account of that year-and-a-half stint, ''Life on the Line: One Woman's Tale of Work, Sweat and Survival'' (Doubleday, $24.95), it wasn't a hard decision. She was bored with her beat to the point of mischief: She had begun to work hidden baseball references into her articles about the bond market. Besides, she wanted, for once, to write a business story from the inside out and from the bottom up.
6/12/1999	ARRIVA IN DEAL TO SELL ITS AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS	Arriva P.L.C. said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its automotive fleet-management business to the General Motors Corporation's finance unit for $:235 million ($376 million). The finance unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, will also assume $:278 million ($445 million) in debt. The fleet management unit, Arriva Automotive Solutions, is one of Britain's biggest fleet companies, managing 70,000 cars for the retailer Marks & Spencer P.L.C., the mortgage lender Halifax P.L.C. and others. The move comes as GMAC expands beyond its main business of financing car loans. On Tuesday, it agreed to buy the Bank of New York's commercial finance business for $1.8 billion, and last month it agreed to acquire the mortgage lender the Contifinancial Corporation. G.M. already has a small fleet of lease vehicles in Britain through the finance arm of its Vauxhall car-making unit.
6/11/1999	G.M. Is Jumping Into the Roadster Market	General Motors' Opel unit says it will build the mid-engine, two-seat Speedster concept it displayed at the Geneva auto show. The car will have an aluminum chassis, composite body and a new four-cylinder engine said to be capable of racing to 60 m.p.h. in less than 6 seconds. The car will be available in Europe by the end of 2000; G.M. says American sales are not planned (though it would fit neatly in Pontiac's sporty lineup).
6/9/1999	Bank of New York Is Selling Lending Operation to G.M.	The General Motors Corporation agreed today to buy the Bank of New York's commercial lending unit for $1.8 billion as the auto maker diversified its holdings and the bank continued to specialize its operations. G.M.'s lending unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, said that it would add the BNY Financial Corporation and its affiliates as a new unit by the end of the month. ''We're buying this for growth,'' said William F. Muir, GMAC's chief financial officer.
6/9/1999	Auto Negotiations Are Likely to Aim for a Longer Pact	With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal since the 1950's, auto executives and union officials say. Chastened by last summer's 54-day strike against G.M. in Flint, Mich., and enjoying the soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay produced by record auto sales, management and workers appear eager to avoid another showdown this year. Serious differences could still produce a strike, but industry and union leaders alike are now using the tamest rhetoric in many years.
6/9/1999	G.M. AND CLEAR CHANNEL BUY STAKE IN XM SATELLITE RADIO	XM Satellite Radio Inc., a company hoping to broadcast radio programs directly to vehicles by satellite, said yesterday that it had sold a $250 million stake to a consortium that includes the General Motors Corporation and the radio giant Clear Channel Communications. Shares of XM Satellite's parent, the American Mobile Satellite Corporation of Reston, Va., surged 20.52 percent, or $3.4375, to $20.1875. XM Satellite seeks to provide radio listeners nationwide with music, news and entertainment through its satellite-to-receiver broadcasting service. The news is a setback for the company's rival, CD Radio Inc., which, like XM Satellite, is trying to build radio networks to transmit broadcasts from satellites to special receiving equipment in consumers' vehicles.
6/3/1999	Vehicle Sales Increased by 5.3% in May	Auto executives were exuberant today as May's car and truck sales propelled the industry toward its best year ever. Despite weak results from the General Motors Corporation, the industry's sales rose 5.3 percent in May compared with results in the period a year earlier, when sales were also stellar. Last month's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 17.3 million was surpassed only by a rate of 17.8 million set in December 1986. Anything more than an annual rate of 15 million rate is considered strong.
6/3/1999	A Boom Built on Big Wheels; Sales of Light Trucks Drive the Auto Industry's Expansion	Craig J. Thomas stands near the end of DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s assembly line in Fenton, Mo., and waits for a spindly orange robot to lower a pickup bed to meet the rest of a Dodge Ram truck. Then, 37 times an hour, 300 times a day, he bolts the bed to the truck and waits for the next pickup to reach him. In mid-May, he got a break from the rhythm of the robots to celebrate with other workers: the company said it would spend $435 million to expand the Ram factory.
6/2/1999	Cashing in some brand equity, Chevrolet resolutely steers the Impala down Memory Lane.	IT may not be for your father's Impala, but the advertising promoting the latest model of that Chevrolet might take him back a few years. That's because Chevy has revived its popular 1950's song ''See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet'' in a new campaign for the 2000 model Impala.
5/30/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Silverado; The Cover Is Familiar But the Book Is All New	HOW important are General Motors' full-size pickups? Check out Wall Street's numbers or Main Street's traffic. These are the company's most popular products, with some 700,000 sold annually. They are lucrative, returning several thousand dollars in profit for each one sold. They also serve as the basis for a fleet of big sport utilities that account for another 400,000 even more profitable sales. Furthermore, with demand exceeding supply, G.M. hopes to ramp up production this year to build an additional 300,000 trucks and sport utilities. If it succeeds, it could end up with $30 billion in annual sales from this platform -- enough to rank in the top 35 of the Fortune 500, exceeding the value of all the microchips from Intel, all the drugs from Merck, all the sodas and snacks from Pepsico. G.M. can use a runaway hit, particularly as it has lost its ranking as the world's largest industrial company. Ford claimed that title on Friday when G.M. spun off its huge Delphi parts operation.
5/30/1999	G.M. Removes Itself From Industrial Pedestal	Though often misquoted and taken out of context, a remark by Charles E. Wilson that ''for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa,'' has long stood for the view that the business of America is very big business, so get out of the way. Whatever G.M.'s president was driving at in 1953, if he made the comment today it would have to be ''What's good for Ford Motor is good for America.''
5/30/1999	Reading the Speedometer of G.M.'s Spinoff	ROUGHLY a million General Motors shareholders will get an unexpected present when they open their brokerage account statements for this month: about 70 shares of Delphi Automotive Systems for every 100 shares of G.M. they hold, the second part of G.M.'s divestiture of Delphi, its parts division. The question, of course, is whether to hold onto an untested auto parts company or to bail out by selling the shares and investing the money elsewhere. Think of it as a choice between racing to your destination in a cherry-red Corvette or taking a bus: You don't want Delphi if speed is what you're after, but Delphi is cheap and it should get you there -- it just might take longer, and the ride could get bumpy.
5/30/1999	Secret Witness To Car Crashes In Black Boxes	Northwest 54th Street in Miami was crowded at 4:30 P.M. on Feb. 7, 1997, and many people saw the three-car collision that killed Detective Robert Vargas. But none of them could help the police determine why he died. The 29-year-old detective, responding in his unmarked car to a robbery call, had what looked to investigators like a relatively minor collision with a Chevy Blazer entering the intersection from his right. His year-old Chevy Lumina skidded across the double yellow line into oncoming traffic and was struck head-on by a Mercury Marquis.
5/29/1999	SUGAR-COATED PRESSURE	Brazil's Government and its powerful sugar lobby have persuaded Ford and General Motors to make ethanol-powered automobiles for the domestic market. The agreement will benefit a sugar industry hurt by low prices and the dominance of gasoline-fueled cars. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, was once the leader in promoting ethanol, a cleaner-burning fuel that can be made from sugar or corn. The agreement came in conjunction with a wider accord cutting taxes on cars in exchange for pledges by auto makers to limit layoffs. It was unclear how many ethanol cars would be produced. Simon Romero (NYT)
5/28/1999	BRAZIL AUTO DEAL	The Brazilian Government and car makers reached an agreement cutting taxes on automobiles as an effort to save jobs in an industry battered by high interest rates. The accord maintains a previous pact that lowered taxes on small- and medium-sized cars in exchange for pledges from car makers, including General Motors and Fiat, to delay layoffs. Taxes will remain reduced for 90 days; car makers will suspend job cuts for 120 days. The agreement coincided with news that unemployment in Sao Paulo, the heart of the country's auto industry, had risen to a record 20.3 percent in April, from 19.9 percent in March. Simon Romero (NYT)
5/27/1999	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the spinoff of Delphi Automotive Systems by General Motors, which owns 82.3 percent of it, misstated the distribution of shares. G.M. shareholders will receive 80.1 percent of Delphi; 2.2 percent will go to a nonpension retirement plan. The remaining 17.7 percent of Delphi is already publicly held.
5/25/1999	G.M. Is Set to Spin Off Parts Division	The General Motors Corporation is pushing Delphi, its auto parts maker, out of the nest and into its shareholders' portfolios on Friday. For G.M. the spinoff ends a 90-year tradition of vertical integration -- a strategy of making most of the parts as well as the final product. It began the transformation in February, when it sold 100 million Delphi shares, or 17.7 percent of the company, to the public.
5/21/1999	With Cars, a Name Is More Than Just a Name	To the Editor: ''It's a Car Name -- It Doesn't Have to Make Sense'' (Cars section, May 19) neglected to mention one of the most inappropriately named cars I can think of: the Chevrolet Caprice (which General Motors recently stopped producing).
5/19/1999	When Things Get Out of Hand, These Cars Take Over	IT'S the second emergency turn that smashes cars. Most drivers faced with debris or a stopped car in their lane can negotiate the first swerve, say automotive engineers. But that second turn, trying to bring their cars back under control -- that's when they oversteer and fishtail into an uncontrollable skid. Or an understeer skid begins, and the car plows forward, ignoring steering commands.
5/19/1999	The Trip From Purr and Rumble to Rattle and Roar	THE man who invented Gatorade, Dr. Robert Cade, had a thing for old Studebakers. By the early 1970's, of course, there were no new Studebakers. The company was as extinct as a dodo. But Dr. Cade had seven or eight of them roosting around his house, near the University of Florida medical school, like a flock of molting birds: Golden Hawks and Silver Hawks and Sky Hawks from the mid-50's, their beaked noses rusting gently against one another's tired fenders. When driven, they creaked. They rattled. They groaned. Wheezing down the street with him one day, I noticed that he kept one nervous eye on the rear-view mirror, afraid that he was about to be arrested for an expired license plate, brake lights that didn't light, turn signals that didn't blink.
5/12/1999	Despite a bribery scandal, General Motors is committing big money to an Olympics campaign.	OTHER companies may be shying away from Olympic sponsorships after the bribery scandal involving the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, but the General Motors Corporation is stepping up its advertising and marketing plans. G.M., which had already committed to a 10-year sponsorship worth roughly $900 million, is now concentrating on getting the biggest bang for its big money. Yesterday it announced new marketing efforts on several fronts: it will give cars and trucks to aspiring Olympic athletes, then advertise the gifts; it has committed to Olympic sponsorships with all NBC owned-and-operated stations through 2008, and it plans to link specific vehicles with certain sports for promotional purposes. Some promotions will begin as early as next month, and all are intended to take advantage of the sponsorship deals not just during the two weeks of the Games but for the months running up to the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, next year and the years before the Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2002.
5/7/1999	Belated Bragging Rights for Lincoln	AS the battle for first place in luxury vehicle sales heated up last year, the Ford Motor Company insisted that winning was not its goal for Lincoln. Rather, its priorities were building the brand, entering new segments of the market and attracting younger buyers. It sounded like an excuse from a company that feared it would lose the race once again. Indeed when the numbers were in, General Motors' Cadillac Division seemed to win by a nose, thanks to an unlikely come-from-behind selling blitz in December.
5/6/1999	Oops, Cadillac Says, Lincoln Won After All	Here in the Motor City, auto makers take their annual battles for sales titles very seriously. Perhaps the most fiercely fought feud has been between Cadillac and Lincoln, as Cadillac struggled to keep its 57-year winning streak as the nation's best-selling luxury car. Last year, Cadillac acknowledged pulling out all the stops to hold on to the title. After reporting almost unbelievable sales results in December, Cadillac eked out a come-from-behind victory by just 222 cars.
5/6/1999	G.M. TO OFFER $500 MILLION OF CLASS H SHARES TO PUBLIC	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it planned a public offering of $500 million of its class H common shares, which track its Hughes Electronic Corporation unit. G.M., the nation's No. 1 auto maker, said proceeds would go to Hughes and that it would provide Hughes with an additional $500 million in equity. Hughes said it would use the $1 billion to improve its balance sheet and repay debt related to its recent acquisitions of Primestar Inc. and the U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Company. Hughes Electronics, based in El Segundo, Calif., is a leader in communications satellites and direct broadcast television. G.M.'s class H shares rose 56.25 cents, to $56.0625, and G.M. fell $2.0625, to $86.9375.
5/5/1999	April Auto Sales Impressive Despite Lower G.M. Results	Car and truck buyers were out in force in April, and as a result the auto industry turned in strong sales results just as it heads into the crucial summer selling season. Sales rose 3.9 percent over all in April, and the industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans at a brisk seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.3 million. The impressive results came despite lower-than-expected sales at the General Motors Corporation. G.M. said its sales fell 4 percent in April, with car sales falling 4.5 percent and truck sales falling 3.5 percent compared with results in the month a year earlier. Wall Street analysts cautioned that the G.M. results were not as weak as they seemed because G.M. had blockbuster results last April when it was offering particularly hefty rebates. Still, analysts expected G.M.'s sales to decline no more than 3 percent.
5/4/1999	G.M. to Build Brazil Factory As Model for Future Plants	The General Motors Corporation has reached an agreement on terms for completion of a futuristic factory in a southern Brazilian state, which last week lost a similar project planned by the Ford Motor Company because of disagreements on how it would be financed. In an accord reached on Saturday, G.M. agreed to earlier repayments on a loan of about $150 million extended by the state of Rio Grande do Sul so the car maker could move forward with the plant, an innovative assembly operation known as Blue Macaw expected to produce 120,000 subcompact automobiles a year.
5/2/1999	It's the Extras That Count	VIRTUALLY every manufacturer has minivan ergonomics down pat. After all, functionality, comfort and convenience are the reasons people drive these mobile dens. So other factors now count: Four doors have become essential for convenience (and for children's safety on one-way streets). Power-operated sliding doors win extra credit. I also appreciate extra horsepower and nimble, car-like handling. Clever ideas, like well-placed storage nets and power outlets, are a big plus.
5/2/1999	Rating Vans: Who Has the Best Family Room for the Road?	CHRYSLER created the modern minivan, and for 15 years it has successfully fended off the arrows of a pack of challengers. But the rivals keep coming with ever more potent weapons, including new vans this year from Ford and Honda (on the heels of improved competition from General Motors and Toyota). But just as van makers figured out what customers want in a family vehicle -- from extra doors to cup holders to secondary music sources with headphone jacks -- the market has cooled. Although sales have picked up nicely this year, they remain below their 1994 peak, and rebates and discounts are common. Sport utility vehicles are one reason, and rebellion against the vans' soccer-mom image is another.
5/2/1999	From Skeptic To Admirer	I HAD not cared much for minivans, preferring the handling of even a station wagon over these boxes on wheels. Then I took a family trip in a Plymouth Grand Voyager, hauled home a Christmas tree on the roof of a Toyota Sienna and took some Cub Scouts camping in a Ford Windstar.
5/2/1999	River Village Plans For Life After G.M.	General Motors is almost done taking apart the massive plant here where it made 11 million cars. As workers cart off chunks of steel and long ribbons of aluminum in the shadow of the Hudson highlands, this village is beginning to feel less like a factory town and more like a river town. ''There are vistas opening up that no one has seen for the last 100 years,'' said the Mayor, Philip E. Zegarelli. ''It's like a curtain rising.''
4/30/1999	Corrections	A review of the 2000 Buick LeSabre in the Automobiles section on Sunday referred incorrectly to the engine of another Buick model, the Park Avenue. It is a V6, not a V8.
4/29/1999	G.M. in Funeral Car Deal	The General Motors Corporation signed a three-year agreement today to supply the Service Corporation International with 1,500 cars and commercial vehicles annually. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Service Corporation is a global funeral-services company that has a fleet of more than 13,000 vehicles.
4/25/1999	Back at the Office	When Harry J. Pearce, the 56-year-old vice chairman of General Motors, went in for his annual physical a year ago, he had every reason to believe that his fitness program had kept him healthy. But his white blood cell count was low. Just in case, he had a bone marrow test. On May 26, during a meeting of G.M.'s top executives, he was told by phone that he had to hear the results in person.
4/25/1999	A Queen of the Ballroom Learns a Red-Hot Tango	MY 40-something neighbor cut to the chase: ''What are you doing with that old-folks car in your driveway?'' I stammered and muttered something about how this new Buick, the 2000-model LeSabre, had a totally different feel. But I could tell he wasn't buying it. His mind was made up, like those of many baby boomers. He was thinking that Buicks have mushy rides, imprecise handling and styling that shouts, ''Hey, Mom, Grandpa is here!''
4/24/1999	EARLY RETIREMENT TO SALARIED WORKERS IS OFFERED	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker, is offering early retirement incentives to United States salaried workers as it cuts jobs to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The auto maker set no target, and the number who retire may be more or less than the 1,000 reported yesterday by The Detroit News, a spokesman, Pat Morrissey, said. Eligible employees can make their decision through Nov. 1. G.M. and its Delphi Automotive Systems unit have reduced their United States white-collar work force by 1.1 percent, to 66,439, and the hourly employment by 16 percent, to 207,302, since 1995.
4/21/1999	2 U.S. Auto Makers Delay New Factories in Brazil	Citing the pressure from other priorities on his state's finances, an opposition Governor in southern Brazil has disrupted plans by General Motors and the Ford Motor Company to build two car factories regarded as prototypes for automobile manufacturing of the future. G.M. has delayed by at least six months its plans to produce compact cars at a plant code-named the ''Blue Macaw'' project in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state. The delay could affect the auto maker's plans for similar plants in the United States and elsewhere. Ford has put on hold plans to build a plant for its ''Project Amazon,'' also intended to produce inexpensive small cars.
4/16/1999	Ford and G.M. Post Increases in Earnings	Cashing in on very strong sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United States, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company today posted increases in operating earnings during the first quarter that were even larger than financial analysts had expected. Americans bought a record 16.9 million cars and trucks in the first quarter, and that meant both companies' factories in the United States were struggling to keep pace, while the need for rebates and other discounts dwindled. The auto makers' car loan divisions and European subsidiaries made more modest profits, while they lost money in Latin America and East Asia.
4/13/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; At G.M., Speculation on Chairman's Successor	Harry J. Pearce, the vice chairman of the General Motors Corporation, has largely recovered from leukemia and is again a leading candidate to succeed John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, who turned 61 last Tuesday, auto industry executives said. Mr. Smith had been delegating considerable responsibility this year to Mr. Pearce, 56, and to G. Richard Wagoner Jr., 46, who became G.M.'s president and chief operating officer last October. Mr. Wagoner is likely to play a prominent but slightly more junior role in combination with Mr. Pearce after Mr. Smith retires, said industry officials, all of whom insisted on anonymity.
4/11/1999	Washington Talk; Soft Money and Some Not-So-Hard Promises	Bookshelves in the capital are sagging with countless handsomely bound, carefully researched, long-forgotten reports proposing laws and policies that, were they ever to be adopted, would affect millions of Americans. One characteristic of these studies -- about Social Security, taxes, health policy, education and dozens of other areas -- is that the people who conduct them and make the recommendations often do not themselves follow the prescriptions in their own daily lives that they would impose on the body politic.
4/9/1999	Cadillac signs a long-term accord for signs in Times Square.	THE automotive brand promoted as the standard of the world is taking a long-term parking space in the neighborhood promoted as the crossroads of the world. Cadillac, the luxury division of the General Motors Corporation, has signed its first extended lease for advertising signs in the cacophonous canyons of Times Square. For the next three years, Cadillac ads will be visible on 2 Times Square, the northern anchor of the district at the corners of 47th Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue.
4/8/1999	G.M. Sales Fell in March, Missing Auto Makers' Boom	The General Motors Corporation missed out on sizzling vehicles sales in March, reporting today that its car and truck sales fell more than 2 percent from those in the month a year earlier. Every auto maker except G.M., Mazda and Suzuki reported higher sales in March, and some set March and first-quarter records.
4/7/1999	First-Quarter Auto Sales Said to Be Fastest Start Ever	When the General Motors Corporation reports its sales of cars and trucks in March on Wednesday, the first quarter of 1999 will most likely go into the books as the best start ever to a sales year for the United States auto industry. Virtually every auto maker closed March and the first quarter with sales higher than last year's healthy levels. Last week, DaimlerChrysler, Volvo, Honda and Infiniti reported record March sales. Kia had its best month ever, Volkswagen had its best March since 1981, and Subaru had its best March since 1988. Audi, BMW with Land Rover, Isuzu and Nissan also reported higher sales.
4/4/1999	Private Sector; Better Luck With Yukon	G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the president and chief operating officer of General Motors, invited scores of guests to a reception at Grand Central Terminal on Monday night followed by a party to celebrate the N.C.A.A. men's basketball championship game. A former Duke University basketball player, Mr. Wagoner unveiled two big sport utility vehicles, the Chevrolet Suburban and the GMC Yukon, then sat down in front of a wide-screen television to cheer for his alma mater. Duke, however, was upset by the University of Connecticut.
4/3/1999	Hughes Electronics Collects U.S. Payment	The Hughes Electronics unit of the General Motors Corporation has collected $154 million in damages from the United States Government, ending a 26-year legal battle over patented technology used to help orient communications satellites. The payment resolves assertions by Hughes, the world's largest satellite maker, that from 1963 to 1982 the Government used the company's proprietary technology without permission.
3/28/1999	And Our Next Sports Car Will Be Called the Blue Devil	Originally, G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of General Motors, was going to be the host of a reception tomorrow night at Cipriani 42d Street, in advance of the New York Auto Show. But G.M. had a change of heart after a restaurant workers' union ran a newspaper ad urging a boycott of the Rainbow Room, another establishment run by the Cipriani family, and saying, ''a lot of people think the Ciprianis have hearts of stone.'' The car maker promptly switched the site to Vanderbilt Hall of Grand Central Terminal, but the change it highlighted in large letters in its letter to the media was something else altogether.
3/20/1999	G.M. and VW to Increase Output in Brazil	The General Motors Corporation and Volkswagen A.G. plan to increase production in Brazilian factories, providing signs of life in the country's struggling auto industry. Volkswagen plans to increase daily production of the compact Gol, Brazil's No. 1 model, to about 800 units from the current 650 by next month. General Motors is increasing the daily shift at its Sao Caetano factory by two hours a day.
3/14/1999	Another Hoedown at Saturn Ranch	NO plans for a summer vacation? If you own a Saturn automobile -- or are just a Saturn groupie -- the General Motors Corporation's import-fighting subsidiary wants to show you a good time. The second Saturn Homecoming is set for July 30-31 in tiny Spring Hill, Tenn., to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary. Five years ago, the first Homecoming -- a cross between a country fair, a vast car-club meet and a religious revival -- attracted an unexpectedly large crowd of 44,000. Saturn is expecting 60,000 people this year, with another 150,000 celebrating the occasion at the dealerships where they bought their cars.
3/14/1999	The Nation: Hold Onto Your Cap; Taking the Caddy for a Spin	MENTION Cadillac and the images that spring to mind are pretty sedate: Midwestern grandfathers tooling down suburban roads, perhaps, or chauffeurs in caps holding rear doors open for wealthy widows carrying sculpted poodles out of Fifth Avenue co-ops. These are precisely the images Cadillac is trying to change. The result has been a series of off-beat -- and sometimes off-key -- efforts to build a new, sprier reputation for Cadillac. The latest: Cadillac is building a race car to compete next year at Le Mans, the venerable French race in which entrants try to drive as many times around a course as possible in 24 hours.
3/9/1999	Health Concern Hired by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker, hired a consultant today to help plan medical treatments for 60,000 salaried workers and their dependents, an effort it says will make health care more consistent and control its $4.5 billion annual tab. Beginning April 1, the care-management company Health International Inc. will help to set treatment plans for white-collar workers covered by a traditional fee-for-service or preferred provider plan at G.M. or its parts unit, the Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation.
3/5/1999	Metro Business; Trump Eyes Ex-G.M. Site	Donald Trump said yesterday that he was seriously considering a plan to turn a former General Motors Corporation assembly plant site in Tarrytown, N.Y., into a $1 billion residential, retail and hotel complex. The 96-acre site has been vacant since the plant was shut down in 1996.
3/4/1999	G.M. Joins Rivals in Posting Robust Sales for February	The General Motors Corporation, which today reported higher February sales, finally appears to be rebounding from last summer's strike and joining its rivals in the robust auto market. After a disappointing January for which G.M. was one of the only auto makers to report sales that were lower than in the previous year, G.M. joined its competitors in posting a healthy gain in February. The company reported total car and light-truck sales of 385,318 for the month, an increase of 17 percent from a year earlier. G.M.'s sales in February 1998 were extremely poor, however, lowering the auto maker's share of the car and light-truck market below 30 percent. The sales slump spurred the auto maker to begin a huge incentive campaign aimed at loyal G.M. owners. The successful promotion kept G.M. sales rolling until workers at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., went on strike, closing nearly all of G.M.'s assembly plants for most of the summer. Since then, the auto maker has struggled to catch up to its pre-strike sales momentum and inventory levels.
2/26/1999	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Safety; Keeping Children Out of Danger	IN three separate accidents last summer, 11 small children climbed into car trunks, pulled them shut and died from the heat when they could not get out. Beginning in March, after a complicated design effort, General Motors will offer an illuminated release handle. The handles, which dealers will install as options inside trunks, stay lighted for half an hour after the trunk is closed.
2/26/1999	Saturn Plant's Union Leaders Are Voted Out	All of the union local leaders who made Saturn one of the nation's most prominent experiments in labor relations have been voted out of office by union members, who chose new leaders who have advocated a more traditional and less close relationship with management. The General Motors Corporation set up Saturn in Tennessee in 1986 in an effort to create a car company with labor relations that would be less rancorous and more cooperative. For the last 13 years, the local Saturn union had been led by Michael E. Bennett, who frequently defied the national leadership of the United Automobile Workers union by linking pay to productivity and encouraging workers to participate in a wide range of decisions with management.
2/24/1999	G.M. TO BUY ITS STEEL IN MULTIYEAR CONTRACTS	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest user of steel, will buy $11.7 billion worth of the metal from about 40 suppliers under multiyear contracts, a departure from the auto industry custom of one-year contracts that allows G.M. to take advantage of low commodity prices. The new contracts, each covering three or four years of deliveries from companies including Bethlehem Steel and AK Steel Holding, are for a total of 18 million metric tons of steel. G.M. said yesterday that it was talking with ''a number'' of unnamed suppliers about contracts covering as long as 10 years. Benchmark United States steel prices have dropped about 20 percent in the last year, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd.
2/19/1999	New Troops for the General  	AR doors hinged at the rear, like the small third door of Saturn coupes and the rear access doors of many long-cab pickups, have traditionally been known as ''suicide doors'' among car buffs. While this design is virtually as old as the closed-cabin car, the origin of the descriptive name is unclear. It no doubt had something to do with the dangers posed by doors that could fly open if a passenger accidentally pulled on the lever-like inside door handles of old-time cars. And if the front-opening door went ajar while the car was moving, the wind could catch the door and fling it back, possibly throwing the passenger out of the cabin.
2/7/1999	'Suicide Doors' Find New Life In Safer Form	NECESSITY is the mother of invention, and for the Saturn Corporation of General Motors, a rather simple invention is generating a much-needed lift in sales of its aging car line. Saturn's coupe, sedan and wagon, developed in the 1980's and introduced in 1990 -- with few significant changes since -- compete in an ice-cold part of the market. Small-car sales have dropped nearly 10 percent over two years -- Saturn's sales plunged 17 percent -- as buyers shifted to sport utilities, midsize sedans and more luxurious cars. A midsize Saturn, the L-Series, comes this summer, and another freshening of the small cars is due. Still, existing models will not be replaced until the 2003 model year.
2/7/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Saturn SC2; Finding a Jackpot Behind Door No. 3	As many of its competitors reported double-digit sales increases, the General Motors Corporation said today that January sales rose a scant 4 percent compared with exceptionally weak sales in the month a year earlier. ''We are disappointed in the January results,'' said Michael DiGiovanni, G.M.'s chief forecaster. ''But we're optimistic going forward.''
2/4/1999	G.M. Disappointed by January Sales	The General Motors Corporation's Delphi Automotive Systems unit, the world's No. 1 maker of auto parts, has cut executive bonuses. G.M. could face difficulty selling the unit to investors after a loss last year. G.M. reduced the 1998 bonus of J. T. Battenberg 3d, Delphi's chief executive, by 56 percent, to $450,000, ''to reflect the year-to-year decline in reported earnings,'' Delphi wrote in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 20. The submission was part of the planned sale early next month of 17.7 percent of the parts company's stock. GM shares fell $1 yesterday, to $89.75.
1/24/1999	Don't Trust Car Dealers? Here's a New Deal	DONALD THORNTON, a successful Ford dealer here for many years, still recalls his anger on the day three decades ago when his daughter Kathy, then 7, came home from a birthday party in tears. ''This little kid next to her -- the little worm, I could choke him -- leaned over and said, 'My daddy says all car salesmen are crooks,' '' Mr. Thornton recounted recently, sitting at the scarred wooden desk across which he has been selling cars since 1973.
1/23/1999	DirecTV to Buy A Major Rival For $1.8 Billion	In a major consolidation of the satellite-TV broadcasting industry, Hughes Electronics Inc.'s DirecTV Inc. subsidiary has agreed to buy troubled Primestar Inc., its major competitor, for $1.8 billion. The purchase of Primestar by Hughes, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, would leave only one other significant competitor in satellite-TV broadcasting, the Echostar Communications Corporation.
1/22/1999	New Safety Options On Cadillac DeVille	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would offer a package of high-technology driver-assistance features on the 2000-model-year Cadillac DeVille, which goes on sale in the spring. Speaking in New York to the International Motor Press Association, Edward J. Zellner, G.M.'s vehicle chief engineer for luxury cars, said one feature was an ultrasonic device that alerts the driver to obstacles behind the car while parking.
1/21/1999	G.M.'s Profit Rose 7.7% in Fourth Quarter	The General Motors Corporation today announced an unexpectedly large increase in profits during the fourth quarter of last year, as the very strong American auto market and the company's continued recovery from last summer's strike more than offset losses in Latin America and East Asia. G.M.'s profits rose 7.7 percent, to $1.77 billion, during the fourth quarter, but fell 53.2 percent, to $2.96 billion, for all of last year because of a 54-day strike in June and July at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. The strike forced the auto maker to close almost all of its assembly plants in North America.
1/17/1999	Cadillac Keeps Its Sales Title	OUNTERING the expectations of analysts and even of its own executives, the Cadillac division of General Motors held onto first place in the luxury class last year -- but just barely. Going into December, it seemed that Lincoln, the luxury marque of the Ford Motor Company, would surpass Cadillac in overall sales, a feat Lincoln last accomplished in 1939. With Lincoln leading by 7,000 vehicles as of Dec. 1, Cadillac conceded that it could lose its title.
1/15/1999	Lemon Awards Cite Spots for Criticism	Advertisers including Telecom USA, the Miller Brewing Company, the Saturn unit of the General Motors Corporation and the Quaker Oats Company were among 10 singled out for criticism yesterday when the Center for Science in the Public Interest presented its 14th annual Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Awards. The ''awards'' mock marketers for advertisements that are considered misleading by a group of national consumer, environmental and health advocacy organizations. They are named for Harlan Page Hubbard, a 19th-century adman.
1/13/1999	9 Auto Makers Form Coalition	Nine auto makers announced today that they had formed a new trade association. The members of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers are the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation of the United States; BMW A.G., Volkswagen A.G. and DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany; A.B. Volvo of Sweden, and the Mazda Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan.
1/12/1999	BIGGEST ONE-DAY GAIN IN 11 YEARS FOR G.M. STOCK	Shares in the General Motors Corporation rose 7.5 percent yesterday, the biggest one-day gain in more than 11 years, as higher-than-expected production in the fourth quarter fueled optimism that the company might earn record profits this year. The shares rose $6, to $86.0625. The company saw a 12 percent gain last week after it said it would increase production of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. G.M., the world's largest auto maker, is benefiting from unexpectedly strong American sales and from progress in cost-cutting, analysts said.
1/8/1999	Corrections	A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about 1998 auto sales reversed the market-share figures for Chrysler and Toyota cars, and included incorrect light-truck market-share figures for Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Nissan. A corrected chart appears today on page C2.
1/8/1999	G.M. and Union Are Near Deal on New Plants	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union are close to an agreement on the construction of three new assembly plants in the United States that would need only a third as many workers as the operations they replace, company and union officials said this week. Mark Hogan, G.M.'s vice president for small cars, said that the company, the world's largest auto maker, hoped to reach labor agreements in 60 to 90 days that would allow the replacement of G.M.'s small-car factories in Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing, Mich. The new factories would likely be built within a few miles of the existing sites and open in 2002.
1/7/1999	Auto Industry Finds Surprises At the End of a Rainbow Year	Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from which the General Motors Corporation has not fully recovered. With the last auto makers reporting their results today, the industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase from 1997.
1/4/1999	John D. McDonald, 92, Author of a Classic on Business Strategy	John D. McDonald, who with Alfred P. Sloan Jr. wrote ''My Years With General Motors,'' a classic volume on business strategy that has been used as a college text for 35 years, died Dec. 23 of respiratory failure, his daughter Joan McDonald Miller said yesterday. He was 92. Mr. McDonald was visiting his other daughter, Christie, at her vacation home in Berkshire, Vt., when he died, Mrs. Miller said.
1/3/1999	G.M. Knocking at Auto Show Door	THE General Motors Corporation practically invented the auto-design extravaganza, piquing the public's interest in the 1950's with its glitzy Motorama shows that included futuristic concept cars. But in recent years, as its budgets were cut and its marketers gained prominence over its designers, G.M. has pretty much sat in the shadows at the leading auto shows, upstaged by its crosstown rivals. This year, G.M. is planning to make a splash once again. Starting with the 1999 North American International Auto Show here, where press previews begin today, and continuing through the other leading shows this year, G.M. wants the world to know that a lot is going on behind the closely guarded doors of its design center.
12/24/1998	G.M.'S DELPHI AUTOMOTIVE TO OFFER 17.7% STAKE TO PUBLIC	The Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation, the auto parts unit of the General Motors Corporation, said yesterday that it planned to sell 17.7 percent of its common stock in an initial public offering. The parts manufacturer, based in Troy, Mich., will seek to sell 100 million common shares, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, plan to market the shares at $14 to $18 each, the filing said. Delphi estimated in the filing that it would raise about $1.53 billion after expenses, assuming a share price of $16.
12/24/1998	G.M. Plans Review of Wartime Record	To the Editor: You challenged General Motors for its alleged collaboration with Nazis during World War II (editorial, Dec. 6), and Frank Rich suggested G.M.'s strategy on World War II was ''stonewalling'' (column, Dec. 2). This issue arose in 1974 during Senate hearings. At that time G.M. reviewed its records and refuted charges that the company actively supported the Nazis. What the record reflected was as follows:
12/21/1998	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the General Motors Corporation's appointment of Cynthia M. Trudell as chairwoman and president of its Saturn division misstated the dates of her service at G.M.'s transmission factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. She was a manufacturing engineering manager and later an operations manager there from 1987 to 1990, not 1981 to 1990. From 1981 to 1987, she was a manager at G.M.'s transmission factory in Windsor, Ontario.
12/20/1998	From Factory to the Top of Saturn	EVER since General Motors was formed through a series of mergers early in this century, executives have often risen to the top without ever managing a factory, relying instead on personal friendships commonly made while serving in the company's powerful treasury office in New York. Now the world's largest auto maker is about to put a true car guy in charge of its Saturn division -- only the car guy is a woman, Cynthia Mary Trudell. On Jan. 1, she will become the first woman to run a car division for an American or foreign auto maker.
12/18/1998	G.M. Tries to Increase Appeal of Electric Car	THE General Motors Corporation sent a top technology executive here recently to promote the latest version of its EV1 electric car, which has new batteries that are supposed to double the driving range to 140 miles between charges. ''We're still going after the innovator who wants the latest,'' said Frank W. Pereira, the G.M. brand manager for advanced technology vehicles. ''This will reach a greater circle of people. It will have utility for more of them.''
12/18/1998	G.M. Opens Buick Plant In Shanghai	At the crowning moment in today's balloons-and-marching-band ceremony to roll out the first Buick made in China, John F. Smith Jr., chairman of the General Motors Corporation, got behind the wheel of a shiny white 1999 sedan, strapped on his seat belt, and was unable to make the car move. Mr. Smith reached down to release the emergency brake, but could not find it. Instead, he popped the hood open. Only after engineers rushed frantically to Mr. Smith's side was he reminded that the Buick's brake release was a foot pedal. Finally on his way, he drove the Buick up a red carpet onto a broad stage, to cheers from a crowd of more than 2,000 staff members and guests.
12/15/1998	Woman Chosen to Head G.M.'s Saturn Division	Facing a shrinking small-car market and struggling to repair its once-legendary labor relations, General Motors' Saturn division appointed an expert on sport utility vehicles and factory management today to become chairwoman and president on Jan. 1. The new head of Saturn, Cynthia M. Trudell, will become the first woman to head a car division at any domestic or foreign auto maker. G.M. had been criticized both inside and outside the auto industry when a management shake-up on Oct. 6 left white men holding all the jobs in the top three layers of management.
12/13/1998	BEHIND THE WHEEL / Cadillac Escalade; 6 Degrees of Sport Utility Separation	PLACARDS in New York City subway cars used to advertise a paternity testing service. If you called DAD-SEARCH in a certain area code, the people there would help you determine who fathered your children. A valuable service, certainly, but could they trace the DNA of your car? Around Detroit, incestuous relationships and unholy alliances produce some curious offspring. Consider the progeny of Cadillac, a grand patriarch of the industry: In the 80's, the dignified family crest appeared on a small car, the Cimarron, that obviously shared its genes with a lowbrow Chevy Cavalier. More recently, Cadillac became the proud parent of a bouncing baby named Catera, which was short, muscular and continental, not oversized, swaggering and American. An amorous European -- face it, a common Opel -- was the absentee father.
12/13/1998	After 59 Years, Lincoln Is Set to Outsell Cadillac	AFTER nearly six decades as the undisputed leader of the American luxury market, Cadillac is poised to lose its crown to Lincoln this year. As of Nov. 30, Lincoln, the luxury division of the Ford Motor Company, had sold 170,265 cars and trucks in 1998. That was nearly 7,000 ahead of Cadillac, which had sales of 163,482 -- mostly cars -- in the same period. The gap grew in November, prompting Cadillac to virtually concede the race.
12/11/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Design; A Suit Makes Them Older and Wiser	FORGET the Fountain of Youth. The Ford Motor Company says it has found value in the opposite -- a suit of clothes that makes its wearer feel old, with stiff joints, dim vision and weak muscles. Ford makes its young designers wear the old costume, on the theory that it gives them empathy for aging customers, and consequently will lead them to design cars that can be used more easily by everyone. The General Motors Corporation is more direct: it has a focus group it calls the Paragon Team, about 30 people with arthritis, vision problems, artificial knees or hips, or other infirmities. It videotapes the team members as they get in and out of vehicles, and as they drive.
12/9/1998	G.M. Raises Rebates On Its 1999 Models	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker, has raised discounts on some 1999 model cars, minivans and trucks in a move that analysts say will help sales while trimming profit in coming months. Through Jan. 4, G.M. is offering discounts of $750 on its Malibu midsize sedan, up from $500, and $1,000 on its Monte Carlo, up from $750. The company also raised rebates on Cavaliers, Venture minivans and S10 Blazers and pickups. Analysts said they doubted that the rebates, which were announced to dealers last Friday, would be enough to help G.M. achieve its goal of capturing 30 percent of United States sales in December. But both G.M. and analysts say rebates could rise even higher in coming months.
12/6/1998	Corporations and Conscience	Americans are understandably ambivalent about the foreign entanglements of American business. Overseas operations can produce profits and support some jobs at home, but they can also help sustain abusive dictatorships and labor practices. In recent years companies like Nike and Unocal have embarrassed themselves with questionable overseas partnerships, but the problem extends far back in American industrial history. The issue was highlighted last week in a Washington Post story on General Motors and Ford operations in Nazi Germany. The Post reported that after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, the chairman of G.M., Alfred P. Sloan, told a shareholder that the internal politics of Nazi Germany ''should not be considered the business of the management of General Motors.'' The company plant in Germany was highly profitable. ''We have no right to shut down the plant,'' Mr. Sloan wrote.
12/2/1998	Journal; What's Good for General Motors . . .	The Swiss banks' stonewall has collapsed. The German industrial giants that exploited slave labor during the war, from Volkswagen to Krupp, are in the crosshairs of class-action suits from Holocaust survivors. In Washington this week 44 nations are represented in a marathon conference co-hosted by the State Department and the Holocaust Memorial Museum to speed the further restitution of Nazi loot, from gold to art. For all this activity, there's been one smaller but not insignificant piece of the story that has received far less scrutiny than the malevolence of the Germans, the Swiss, the French, et al. -- namely, any collaboration between American corporations and the Nazis. On Monday, just as delegates were arriving in Washington for their Holocaust conference, that silence was broken by Michael Dobbs, the Washington Post reporter who last rattled the capital with his revelation of Madeleine Albright's previously unknown Jewish heritage.
11/29/1998	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Oldsmobile Silhouette Premiere; The Minivan With In-Flight Movies	PUTTING televisions and videocassette players in vans is nothing new. Builders of custom vans have been doing it for years. But buying a custom van has often meant accepting all that goes with it: crushed velour curtains, for instance. Moreover, the size and shape of traditional cathode-ray TV's usually require a ''pop-top'' -- a reinforced fiberglass roof into which the monitor is mounted -- that can raise a vehicle's height to more than 7 feet, barring it from many parking decks. Thus owners of TV-equipped custom vans may find themselves exiled from that most sacred of American soil: the mall.
11/27/1998	Agent 007, Your Armored Car Is In	IT looks like any other brand-new BMW 540i. But try firing a .44 Magnum at the ''540i Protection'' -- it handles bullets as blithely as Superman does. Still, no car can do everything that the Man of Steel can; the 540i Protection still has to be driven around tall buildings. We are talking armored cars here, automobiles that have been fortified to withstand attacks by shady characters with guns or crowbars in their hands and larceny, or worse, on their minds.
11/20/1998	Berlin Cameron Wins Cadillac Assignment	The Cadillac division of the General Motors Corporation has named Berlin Cameron & Partners in New York to handle the broadcast television introduction for its 1999 Escalade luxury sport utility vehicle. Billings have not been determined. The assignment is the first to be announced by G.M. for Berlin Cameron, which began working for the company in the spring on corporate marketing and advertising assignments. It is unusual for G.M. to assign work to an agency like Berlin Cameron, a smaller shop that is not a longtime roster agency.
11/19/1998	Wheels for Sipowicz?	FOR all of their diversity, the streetscapes of New York City can be boiled down to a few representative elements: a yellow cab, a hot dog stand and a steaming manhole cover. Throw in a light-blue and white police car, and the location is fixed beyond all doubt. Only in New York, kids, only in New York. Unfortunately, that last component of the city's visual signature will soon go the way of all things. One by one, the N.Y.P.D.'s familiar patrol cars, Chevrolet Caprices painted white and a custom shade that the department calls ''grabber blue,'' are being replaced by lily-white Ford Crown Victorias. By 2000, when the transition is complete, New York will be a bit more like everywhere else.
11/10/1998	G.M. Plans Renovations	The General Motors Corporation plans to make at least $1 billion of renovations to its research and development center in Warren. The renovations to the Warren Technical Center, which was built in the 1950's as a suburban Detroit research campus for G.M., are expected to take as long as five years.
11/8/1998	Stockholders Reject Plan to Move British Auto Supplier to U.S.	After a trans-Atlantic tug-of-war over whether LucasVarity P.L.C., the British-based auto components and aerospace company, should move its headquarters to Buffalo, small shareholders delivered a remarkable rebuff to both management and big American investors, voting by a hair's breadth for the company to remain in Britain. With most of Britain's automotive industry -- from stately Rolls-Royce to minuscule Minis -- owned by American, Japanese or German concerns, the battle had assumed jingoistic overtones, particularly among those who fear that Britain has forfeited its manufacturing base to become a nation of service-providers.
11/6/1998	California to Toughen Its Emissions Standards	Despite strong objections from Detroit's Big Three auto makers, environmental regulators in California voted tonight to require cars, minivans and nearly all sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks to meet identical and much more stringent emissions rules. Tonight's vote makes California the first state to impose car emissions standards on so-called light trucks, a category that includes sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks. Regulated as work vehicles, light trucks have been allowed until now to emit up to three times as much pollution per mile as cars.
11/5/1998	October Sales Of Vehicles Still Surprising	The strength of car and truck sales in October continued to surprise Wall Street analysts and auto industry executives as more figures were released today. October turned out to be one of the strongest months in history and puts the industry on track for its best year in a decade. ''I was looking for strong numbers, and these are stronger than I expected,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York. Mr. Healy noted that the stronger sales came about even as incentives began tapering off from the high levels of last spring and summer.
11/1/1998	Saturn's Long Wait For Some New Wheels	AT the Boston auto show on Friday, the Saturn Corporation pulled the wraps off a new model. While such an introduction is routine for most auto manufacturers, it is a rare occurrence for Saturn. Thirteen years after the General Motors Corporation established Saturn as a grand $5 billion experiment, and eight years after customers began to take delivery of the small cars built in Spring Hill, Tenn., Saturn has been a success in several ways. It consistently ranks near the top in customer satisfaction and buyer loyalty surveys. It has successfully established itself as a youthful, customer-oriented brand capable of taking on the imports, and it has brought in the kind of buyers -- including relatively young, well-educated women -- that other G.M. divisions have had trouble seducing. And some of Saturn's experimental processes have worked so well that they have spread to other parts of G.M. -- one of the original reasons the subsidiary was set up.
10/27/1998	G.M. Reassigns Opel Chief To Key U.S. Post on Labor	The General Motors Corporation replaced the top management today at its most important European subsidiary, Adam Opel A.G., but not before provoking a bitter rebellion by German management and labor leaders. Just four months after G.M. installed Gary L. Cowger as Opel's chairman, officials at the auto maker confirmed today that they were transferring him back to Detroit to lead labor relations. He will be replaced on Nov. 1 by Robert W. Hendry, who runs Saab A. B., the Swedish car maker, in which G.M. owns a controlling stake.
10/26/1998	Opel Leader Resigns From G.M. Europe	A top European executive of the General Motors Corporation resigned over the weekend, the company said, because of ''differing perceptions of the company's business strategy.'' ''After almost 18 years of successful cooperation, we regret to see Hans Wilhelm Gaeb leave,'' John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of G.M., said in Detroit. Mr. Gaeb, 62, was the vice president of G.M. Europe and the chairman of the supervisory board of the G.M. subsidiary Adam Opel A.G.
10/25/1998	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Pontiac Grand Am; Beneath All the Flash, A Firmer Foundation	OVER the years, General Motors has turned out a lot of memorable big cars, but this colossal company has had trouble thinking small. Remember the Corvair, the Vega, the Chevette? The Nova derivatives like the Buick Apollo, or the X-body compacts of the late 1970's? Surely you haven't forgotten the Pontiac Phoenix? In '92, the last time G.M. made waves in the compact end of the midsize market, it turned out three of the decade's most forgettable cars: the banal Olds Achieva (Autoweek called it the ''under-Achieva''); a Buick Skylark that looked like a Wurlitzer jukebox on wheels, and another incarnation of the Pontiac Grand Am. Ubiquitous in rental fleets, these were cars you hoped the Avis agent would assign to someone else.
10/25/1998	GT: The Sport Is Skin Deep	LIKE the weekend jogger who plods in designer Spandex and $150 shoes, the Grand Am GT strikes an athletic pose. The front and rear fascias are even more aggressive than the SE's; there is a wide-open air dam so the Ram Air system can breathe freely; thick ribs run up and down the body-side cladding; low-profile tires clench 16-inch wheels, and the exhaust rumbles a bit through four outlets. But like the occasional runner who stumbles into a time trial, the GT proves itself a poseur with more flash than dash. Yes, its 3.4-liter V6 is willing, with the Ram Air induction funneling cool, pressurized air into the engine, raising horsepower to 175 and peak torque to 205 foot-pounds (from the SE's 170/195). Yes, the four-wheel disk brakes are very good. And yes, the suspension is stiffer than the SE's, and the ride is rougher as a result. But the GT, as either a coupe or sedan, would rather sprint in a straight line than run in zigzags.
10/21/1998	Dave and Audrey Get Down to the Nuts and Bolts	In the summer of 1996, I left my Seattle houseboat and began a 13,000-mile odyssey around the United States, ending up in Detroit the following January for the International Auto Show. My intent was to drive deep into America's national obsession with the automobile and, as a committed environmentalist who loves and writes about cars, to try to resolve some of my own conflicted feelings. I visited places where cars are venerated, despised, built, rebuilt, armored, raced, crashed, crushed -- even buried. Among them was Spring Hill, Tenn., in the hills south of Nashville, where Saturn had become a model of modern industrial relations. I spent a day just before Christmas touring the huge complex. Then, at 5 in the evening, I began making cars.
10/20/1998	Auto Makers Experiment With New Fuels	Struggling to comply with Federal fuel-economy and emissions regulations even as Americans buy ever-bigger family vehicles, auto makers have quietly begun experiments with oil companies to develop new and potentially cleaner fuels. Ford and General Motors have already entered long-term partnerships with oil companies, while Chrysler plans to announce on Wednesday a program with immediate goals: testing vehicles over the next two years that would burn a promising type of synthetic fuel made from natural gas instead of crude oil.
10/9/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY / Buying and Leasing; G.M. Runs the Shows To Spread Its Message	PEOPLE used to go to auto shows to see new car models from all companies and then to a particular dealer to test-drive the one they liked. Now General Motors, eager to regain market share, is trying a new way to sell cars; it is putting on its own one-company auto shows, where visitors can take test drives, to raise the chance that when the customer goes to a dealer, it will belong to G.M. When the world's largest industrial corporation gets its act together and takes it on the road, it is a giant road show -- 150 cars and trucks, including 50 different G.M. brands; a 60,000 square-foot air-conditioned tent; six half-mile test tracks, and 150 people to run the show, with a catering crew that serves a choice of four free entrees.
10/8/1998	G.M. is beginning a $135 million campaign to ballyhoo the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado.	THE General Motors Corporation plans to begin one of the largest advertising campaigns ever in the auto industry this evening, a $135 million effort to promote a complete redesign of the company's best-selling vehicle, the full-sized Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. G.M. plans a barrage of network television commercials combined with ads in 63 magazines and 339 papers and extensive direct-mail solicitations to pickup owners, Chevrolet officials said today. Orchestrated by Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, the technologically innovative campaign emphasizes the greater size and power of the redesigned truck.
10/7/1998	Mourning a Departed Mainstay	The old General Motors assembly plant here is being torn down. And, as if paying their last respects, dozens of former auto workers have been stopping by regularly to watch as construction crews dismantle the factory where some of them spent their entire working lives. While backhoes toppled concrete walls and tractors pushed steel beams into scrap piles, the men and women who came today, many of them retirees who meet regularly at the demolition site to trade memories of life on the assembly line, spoke about a time when a job at G.M. meant security, a decent wage and good standing in the community.
10/7/1998	Nostalgia as a Plant Dies	The naming of G. Richard Wagoner Jr. today as the president and chief operating officer of the General Motors Corporation shows how the world's largest corporation is changing -- and how it is not. In an industry that still views gray hair as a prerequisite for serious responsibility, Mr. Wagoner is a brown-haired 45-year-old. Mr. Wagoner made his reputation not in G.M.'s established markets in North America and Western Europe but in its highly successful Brazilian subsidiary. He even plays basketball, not golf, and watches the basketball games of his alma mater, Duke University, at every opportunity.
10/7/1998	Man in the News: G. Richard Wagoner Jr.; New G.M. President Knows the Profitable Car and the Ugly	The General Motors Corporation is rebounding faster than expected from the strike that shut down virtually all of its North American factories during the summer, according to sales figures reported today. G.M. said September vehicle sales totaled 393,364 cars and light trucks, a 3.1 percent decline compared with the strong sales in the month a year earlier but less of a drop than analysts had expected. G.M.'s truck sales totaled 164,196 vehicles, down 1.5 percent. Car sales were off 4.2 percent, at 229,168 units. G.M. closed the 1998 model year, which ended on Sept. 30, selling 4.6 million light vehicles, down 2.6 percent.
10/6/1998	Sales for G.M. Last Month Were Better Than Expected	The General Motors Corporation plans to combine its domestic and international automotive operations in a shakeup to be announced on Tuesday morning, Wall Street analysts and other people close to the plan said this evening. The combined automotive operations will be led by G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the 45-year-old president of North American operations, who is expected to become G.M.'s chief operating officer and possibly the auto maker's president, they said. Adding G.M.'s empire of foreign subsidiaries to his responsibilities makes it more likely that Mr. Wagoner will someday succeed John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s 60-year-old chairman, chief executive and president.
10/6/1998	G.M. Reportedly to Combine U.S. and Foreign Operations	Scott R. Mackie doesn't envy his old boss. Before he took over recently as head of General Motors Poland, Mr. Mackie worked at G.M.'s big German unit, Opel, under David J. Herman. In June, G.M. dispatched Mr. Herman to Moscow, where he is now puzzling out a strategy in the wake of Russia's troubled collision with capitalism.
10/6/1998	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Tilting but Standing As a Big Domino Falls; Ex-Communist Poland Holds Up Well Next to Russia's Staggering Economy	THE burgeoning Internet has often been compared with the automobile industry in the early days of mass production. Now the big auto makers want to take more of their business on line. The General Motors Corporation intends to become the first auto maker to offer nationwide Internet shopping for the cars and trucks sitting on participating dealers' lots.
9/27/1998	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1999 Oldsmobile Alero; A Key Piece in a Survival Blueprint	OLDSMOBILE is the nation's longest-running auto maker and General Motors' oldest division, but for a decade it has been struggling to remake itself and remain relevant to consumers who don't put much stock in history. For four consecutive years -- 1983 through 1986 -- it tallied sales of more than a million cars a year. But sales slid in the late 80's and 90's, totaling a mere 304,759 cars and trucks in 1997. The drop has prompted many industry observers to speculate about -- and even advocate -- the elimination of the division. Instead, Olds is trying to reinvent itself as the G.M. division that competes with imports.
9/27/1998	Nameplates Reduced to Memories	GENERAL MOTORS is continuing to thin its herd, recently announcing plans to discontinue the Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and the Buick Riviera. The last Riviera will be built on Nov. 25 at G.M.'s Orion Township plant outside Detroit; production of the Olds will end in December at the same factory, which will continue to build the Buick LeSabre and the Oldsmobile Aurora. G.M. is redesigning the Aurora as a full-size sedan to take the Eighty Eight's place.
9/26/1998	Economic Detour in Brazil; Global Crisis Pushes Car Makers Into the Slow Lane	The Volkswagen factory here was built for better days. Thanks to aggressive streamlining over the last four years, the plant's 2,304 shift workers, 137 robots and miles of machinery send another boxy Gol subcompact or Parati station wagon into the world every 90 seconds. But finding homes for all of those cars is something else again.
9/17/1998	AUTO MAKER TO TRIPLE ITS STAKE IN SUZUKI MOTOR	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would pay $315 million to triple its stake in the Suzuki Motor Corporation, the Japanese maker of compact cars and motorcycles. G.M. will raise its stake in Suzuki Motor to 10 percent from its current 3.3 percent. The move, part of an agreement to cooperate globally on the design and manufacture of vehicles, comes as the world's major auto makers are merging or forming alliances to improve competitiveness. G.M. is strong in North America, Latin America and Europe, but it does not have a big presence in Asia. It hopes to use Suzuki as a springboard to increase its presence there.
9/17/1998	G.M. to Kill 2 Car Models	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would stop building the Buick Riviera and the Oldsmobile 88 cars this fall as part of an effort to consolidate its product lines and cut costs. While the consolidation unfolds, G.M.'s Orion Township assembly plant will operate on one shift for about six months, during which about half its 3,700 workers will be temporarily idled. The consolidation reflects G.M.'s decision to build its large front-wheel-drive cars off just one ''platform'' of powertrain and chassis components, instead of two. G.M., which this summer was hit by two crippling union strikes over productivity and job security issues, is the highest-cost auto maker in the nation and is taking steps to improve.
9/15/1998	G.M. Chairman Urges Rate Cut	The chairman of the General Motors Corporation publicly urged the Federal Reserve today to reduce interest rates, part of what is likely to be a series of such statements by top Midwestern manufacturing executives. John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman, said that spreading economic troubles overseas could cause a recession in the United States if the Fed did not lower rates soon. Lower short-term rates, which the Fed controls, would stimulate the domestic economy and make it easier for other countries to lower their rates.
9/4/1998	In Wake of Strikes, G.M. Posts August Sales Drop	Still struggling with the aftermath of two strikes, the General Motors Corporation reported yesterday that car and light-truck sales fell 36.4 percent in August. At the same time, the Ford Motor Company reported a stronger-than-expected 8.1 percent increase in sales. G.M.'s lower sales pushed the industry down even though nearly all auto companies selling vehicles in the United States reported higher sales. Vehicle sales for the month totaled 1,229,989 cars and light trucks, a decrease of 6.6 percent compared with sales in the month a year earlier.
9/2/1998	Chrysler Sales Break a Record for August	Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks rose 3.5 percent in August, setting a record for the month, though they were off from the blistering pace of the spring. The Chrysler Corporation sold 186,469 cars and trucks in August, up from 180,131 vehicles in August 1997. The previous August record was set in 1996, when the auto maker sold 186,306 vehicles. This spring, Chrysler had been selling more than 200,000 vehicles a month.
8/28/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Shining Infrared Light On Objects in Shadows	IT wasn't a dark and stormy night, but it was a dark and winding road. There were no street lights along the mountain highway outside Carmel; there were only a few houses, widely spaced. Suddenly, a person in a black coat darted in front of the Cadillac DeVille prototype I was driving. I could see him with my naked eye only when I was within several feet of him. By then, he was already across the road.
8/28/1998	A Cadillac Design Heads Toward the Edge	CADILLAC, with its rich tradition but lackluster recent past, has been casting about for a new flagship to embody the brand's attributes. Its designers have come up with a design concept for a two-seat roadster, the Evoq, that will be shown to the public at top-tier auto shows next year. The Evoq (pronounced ''evoke'') will be Cadillac's first concept car in a decade, and ''is envisioned as a flagship model that defines the soul of Cadillac,'' the General Motors division said in releasing a sketch. Intended to evoke the power, emotion and innovation of Cadillac's past, the Evoq suggests that G.M. may enter the roadster market, where cars like the BMW Z3 and the Mercedes SLK230 trade on retro themes.
8/26/1998	Union Faults G.M. on Plans for Parts Unit	Leaders of the United Automobile Workers union strongly criticized the General Motors Corporation today, a sign that this summer's strikes in Flint, Mich. did not produce a reconciliation and that next year's national contract talks between G.M. and the U.A.W. will be contentious. Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, condemned G.M.'s announcement on Aug. 3 of plans to spin off its auto parts subsidiary. Asked at a news conference here today what the U.A.W. planned to do about G.M.'s plans, Mr. Yokich said that another strike was always possible, although he added that the union might not do anything until Sept. 14, 1999. That is when the U.A.W.'s current national agreements with G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are all scheduled to expire.
8/22/1998	G.M. DECIDES IT WILL NOT JOIN BIDDING FOR KIA MOTORS	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had decided not to bid for South Korea's insolvent Kia Motors Corporation. But the Ford Motor Company and three Korean companies remained in the race. Ford, already Kia's biggest shareholder, and Hyundai Motor, Daewoo Motor and Samsung Motor submitted bids before the deadline yesterday. G.M. concluded that Kia and its affiliate Asia Motors ''would not be compatible with our strategic needs,'' Alan Perriton, president of G.M. Korea, said in a statement. Kia Motors is being auctioned after collapsing under $10 billion in debts last year.
8/16/1998	GMC Tries On Some Designer Labels: ENVOY; Once It Was Just A Jimmy; Now It's 'Home, James'	GENERAL MOTORS' marketing wizards have honed their Ginsu knives to a razor's edge as they've sliced and diced the sport utility market. Consider G.M.'s lineup of compact utilities, all of them variations on one basic platform: * The Chevrolet Blazer comes in five trim levels, with two doors or four, with or without four-wheel drive. The Blazer starts at $22,178 and runs to $32,000 -- a new Trailblazer model for 1999 will be $35,000 -- and competes mostly with the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee. It is aimed at buyers in their mid-30's to late 40's with an average household income of $60,000 a year.
8/16/1998	GMC Tries On Some Designer Labels: DENALI; Here's a Preview Of Cadillac's Coming Attraction	IN Detroit's long-running struggle for one-upmanship, the Big Three take their victories wherever they can get them. When General Motors bought the Renaissance Center complex downtown, the new landlord got a certain pleasure in sending a group of tenants packing -- those whose office doors were emblazoned with the oval blue emblem of Ford. Fifteen miles west, at Ford's Glass House in Dearborn, executives have had a year to gloat over their own coup: The Lincoln Navigator had tapped into an unexpectedly large vein of demand for oversized, overstuffed, overwrought sport utility vehicles. Each Navigator returns some $15,000 in profit, and Ford had the market pretty much to itself.
8/15/1998	Strikes Cost G.M. $1.65 Billion	The General Motors Corporation estimated the third-quarter production losses as a result of work stoppages from labor strikes in Flint, Mich., cost it $1.65 billion after taxes, the company said today in a Federal securities filing. The total includes a loss of $1.3 billion for G.M.'s North American operations and another $350 million for G.M.'s Delphi Automotive Systems unit, the auto maker said in its quarterly report for the second quarter, which was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
8/14/1998	Retail Sales Fell in July, U.S. Reports	Retail sales fell four-tenths of 1 percent in July, reflecting the General Motors strikes, the Commerce Department said today. Excluding automobiles, sales rose for the sixth time in seven months. Although July's decline was the first in nine months, it was smaller than the eight-tenths of 1 percent that analysts had expected. Sales increased one-tenth of 1 percent in June.
8/12/1998	What's Good for G.M. Is Good for Its Workers	To the Editor: In ''General Motors Plans to Build New, Efficient Assembly Plants'' (front page, Aug. 6), you note that the United Automobile Workers is concerned that the plants will need fewer workers. Both G.M. and the U.A.W. are missing the obvious. If labor-saving devices were used for their legitimate purpose -- to reduce work time without a cut in pay -- the number of jobs would be maintained.
8/12/1998	Strikes and Asian Crisis Are Factors in U.S. Productivity Drop	The productivity of United States workers fell in the second quarter, the Government said today, the first such drop in three years, as Asia's economic crisis and strikes at General Motors plants took a toll. Productivity -- a measure of the time and effort of providing goods and services -- fell in the second quarter at an annual rate of two-tenths of 1 percent after surging at a 3.5 percent pace in the first three months of the year.
8/9/1998	A New Route for General Motors	After three decades of decline, General Motors remains the world's largest company, and its sheer size and the enormous scope of its problems have prompted a succession of executives to seek sweeping solutions costing billions of dollars -- usually with little success. The latest effort came this week, just after G.M. suffered a crippling, nearly eight-week strike, as the company's leaders dribbled out a succession of announcements. On Monday, the company said that it would turn its auto parts subsidiary into a separate company next year. On Tuesday, G.M. announced that it would combine the marketing staffs of its Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac-GMC divisions, with only Saturn remaining independent. And on Wednesday, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said that the auto maker would build a new generation of assembly plants in the United States that would use fewer workers than current factories do, to bolt together large chunks of vehicles built by outside suppliers.
8/8/1998	G.M. Marketing Chief Glum In Assessing Strike Damage	The nearly eight-week-long strike this summer at two General Motors parts factories will continue to hurt the auto maker's sales until October, and some customers have been permanently lost, G.M.'s top marketing executive said here today. In the gloomiest assessment yet of the strike's damage, Ronald L. Zarrella, the group vice president for North American sales, service and marketing, said that G.M. dealerships would not be fully restocked until mid-September. The introduction of some 1999 models will also be delayed, he said, because G.M. has so many parts left over for 1998 models that it is cheaper for the company to keep building those models instead of discarding the parts.
8/7/1998	Stock Options at Hughes	The Hughes Electronics Corporation said today that it was giving about 14,000 employees stock options to promote teamwork after its reorganization into a communications company by its parent, the General Motors Corporation. Hughes, the provider of the 185-channel DirecTV television broadcast system, will give employees the chance to buy 100 Hughes shares at $43.56, or the average of today's high and low share price. Employees cannot exercise the options for two years.
8/6/1998	General Motors Plans to Build New, Efficient Assembly Plants	Seeking to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the world's largest company, the chairman of General Motors said today that the auto maker planned to build a new generation of highly efficient assembly plants in North America. To the dismay of the United Automobile Workers union, the plants could use as little as half as many workers as current assembly plants do. Outside suppliers, many of them with nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by G.M. employees.
8/5/1998	G.M. Will Pare as Many as 1,000 White-Collar Jobs	The General Motors Corporation announced a sweeping reorganization of its internal distribution structure today that is expected to save $200 million to $300 million a year and eliminate as many as 1,000 white-collar jobs. The move follows a meeting Monday of G.M.'s board, its first since the auto maker settled a nearly eight-week strike by the United Automobile Workers at two Flint, Mich., parts plants, which over time virtually shut down North American assembly operations. The strike, which cost the company about $3 billion in potential profit, has increased pressure to cut expenses.
8/4/1998	G.M. Plans To Spin Off Parts Division	The General Motors Corporation announced yesterday that it planned to spin off its gigantic auto parts subsidiary to its shareholders next year, a move that could reignite the labor troubles that led to nearly eight-week-long strikes that ended only last Wednesday. If completed, the move would represent a historic shift away from vertical integration, a corporate strategy in which a company produces most of the parts as well as the final product. Through the 1970's, G.M. promoted its vertical integration as a source of financial strength and savings.
8/2/1998	The Nation: Strike Force; The Relentless March Of Labor's True Foe	THE 54-day General Motors strike erupted over local issues, like the auto maker's push to speed up work at a plant in Flint, Mich., but the strike shared a theme with walkouts as far away as Denmark and South Korea. Underlying these strikes and others is labor's push to resist what many economists say is an irresistible force: globalization, which opens markets to fierce competition. Globalization has pushed G.M. and other companies to reduce costs, and has created downward pressures on wages in wealthy countries. It has pushed companies to downsize, transfer jobs overseas and press their workers to produce more.
7/31/1998	Strike Accord Makes Drastic Moves by G.M.'s Board Unlikely	The board of General Motors faces an unusually difficult meeting on Monday because the company's management raised Wall Street's expectations this summer for a drastic cost-cutting move only to conclude a strike settlement this week that calls for closer cooperation with the United Automobile Workers. Board members will have a wide range of options at their regularly scheduled meeting. Most auto analysts were predicting today that the company would choose limited moves that might not offend the U.A.W. but also might not do much to improve the company's competitiveness.
7/30/1998	The Auto Deal That Resolves Little	The most telling fact about union-management relations at General Motors is that the agreement announced Tuesday to end the strike promises that top officials of the union and the company will talk to each other regularly. Such a promise would be unnecessary at Ford or Chrysler, which have managed to maintain better relations with their workers while making their plants more efficient. Management and workers at G.M. have traditionally viewed each other as the enemy, something that seems not to have changed. Told that G.M.'s stock price had fallen yesterday, a union official responded, ''That's good,'' explaining that he was pleased that G.M. executives would lose a little money.
7/30/1998	For U.A.W., Huge Price and Tiny Victory at G.M.	The General Motors strikes will certainly not give the nation's labor movement the shot in the arm it received last year from the teamsters' strike against the United Parcel Service. Unions trumpeted the U.P.S. strike as an unequivocal victory that gave part-time workers a big raise, but labor can describe the G.M. strikes as, at best, an ultimately successful but extremely costly goal line stand.
7/30/1998	Tallying Losses Instead of Gains In G.M. Dispute	Strikes against two General Motors auto parts factories ended here today after nearly eight weeks as workers ratified a settlement and trooped back into the plants, but the showdown has harmed G.M. and the United Automobile Workers while appearing to produce limited gains for either side. The strikes cost G.M. about $3 billion in after-tax losses, the nation's costliest labor dispute ever before adjusting for inflation, yet produced a deal that mainly calls for a few small changes in work rules at the factories here and other parts factories in Ohio and Indiana.
7/30/1998	Corrections	Because of a production error, the continuation of a front-page article yesterday from Flint, Mich., about a tentative settlement between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers omitted several sentences. The passage should have read: ''G.M. promises not to sell or close before January 2000 either a speedometer and spark plug factory on strike here or two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, where workers had threatened a strike this summer. G.M. also agrees to invest $180 million in new equipment at the other factory on strike here, which makes auto body parts. ''In exchange, the auto maker gets changes in work rules, notably a 15 percent increase in the number of parts that some welders are required to make before stopping work.''
7/29/1998	The Sense Of Relief, Yet Fear of a New Dispute	Along the road leading into the sprawling General Motors metal-fabricating plant here, where the first of two strikes that eventually paralyzed the company began on June 5, picketing workers embraced the news of a tentative agreement with shouts, tears and two-step dance moves. It was a moment that had been hoped for so long that striking workers outside the plant, and a nearby parts plant, sought to savor it by extending their normal two-hour picket line rotations.
7/29/1998	GENERAL MOTORS AND U.A.W. AGREE ON END TO STRIKE	General Motors and the United Automobile Workers agreed today to end the nearly eight-week strike at two auto parts factories here, a dispute that has shut down G.M. assembly plants across North America, pushed hundreds of thousands of workers into temporary unemployment and slowed the nation's economic growth. The settlement, which is subject to ratification votes on Wednesday morning by workers at both factories, settles a wide range of local issues at the two factories and at several other G.M. factories where workers had threatened to strike.
7/29/1998	THE G.M. SETTLEMENT: THE DIVISION -- At G.M., Can't They Get Along?; Lasting Improvement in Labor Relations Is Still Elusive	Like estranged spouses who reluctantly realize they have little choice but to live together again, the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union have ended their quarrel here but remain trapped in a tattered relationship. The most intriguing element of the settlement announced today is a provision calling for the leaders of the two sides to meet periodically to discuss their differences. In a sign of how poorly G.M. and the U.A.W. get along, this was hailed as an important accomplishment.
7/29/1998	Parts Suppliers Eager to Get Back in Action	Automotive parts suppliers welcomed the news today that the General Motors Corporation had reached a tentative settlement with the United Automobile Workers union. Suppliers ''will be ready to shove parts into G.M. before G.M. is even ready to swallow them,'' said David Healy, an automotive analyst.
7/28/1998	Negotiators in G.M. Strike Press On as Arbitration Nears	Negotiators, seeking to resolve strikes at two General Motors parts factories here, continued to put in long hours today, as union officials, in particular, had an incentive to settle before an arbitration ruling on the strikes' legality that could come as soon as Wednesday. Talks continued at both struck factories, at a suburban Flint hotel and at three other factories where the United Automobile Workers union has also threatened strikes. People involved in the bargaining said that an overall agreement was close, but cautioned that it was impossible to predict when the last details would be resolved.
7/27/1998	Walkout at G.M. Plants May Be Nearing an End	Negotiators from General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union held marathon talks until shortly after midnight this morning to settle strikes at two G.M. parts factories here, struggling over a few final details of the company's future investments in the factories. Bargainers took a break only to watch the arrival Sunday afternoon of 18 flat-bed trucks at one of the factories. As more than 100 striking workers cheered and waved green strike placards, the trucks brought back parts-making equipment that G.M. had removed from an auto body parts factory here over Memorial Day weekend, triggering the strikes.
7/26/1998	BEHIND THE WHEEL/General Motors EV1, Toyota RAV4-EV, Honda EV Plus; Charge! Doing an Electric Commute	A TURTLE icon suddenly lit up on the dashboard of my Toyota RAV4 Electric Vehicle. The car's batteries were exhausted and I had entered ''limp home mode,'' which would allow me to putter along at a reduced speed for a few miles to make it back to a charger. But instead of slowing down, the car stalled completely on a dark street a mile from my home. Panicked, I jumped out, pushed the car to the side of the road and began scrounging for coins to call a tow truck.
7/26/1998	The Nation: Living Large; Forget Microsoft. G.M. Is Still the Biggest Kid on the Block.	TO appreciate the size of General Motors, consider this: If the Microsoft Corporation were a G.M. auto parts division, William H. Gates would be just another G.M. vice president that nobody has ever heard of. A quarter-century of shrinking market share and periodic financial crises at G.M. have fed a popular image of the auto maker as a shadow of its former self. Yet G.M. remains the world's largest company in sales and share of global economic output, and is immense by any standard. Growth in the entire American economy has been slowed substantially by eight-week-old strikes here that have paralyzed the auto maker's North American operations.
7/26/1998	G.M. Narrows Gulf in Talks With U.A.W. Over Walkout	In a breakthrough that could signal a possible settlement in the 50-day strike against two General Motors parts factories here, the world's biggest auto maker agreed today to return parts-making equipment to one factory on Sunday, and the United Automobile Workers union agreed that 160 members would cross picket lines to reinstall it. Both sides said some difficult issues remained, yet U.A.W. and G.M. officials said significant progress had been made toward a settlement.
7/25/1998	Confrontation Likely in G.M. Plan to Reopen Plant	General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union moved today toward a confrontation in Kentucky even as lawyers for both sides continued to argue before an arbitrator over the legality of strikes at two G.M. parts factories here. G.M. announced earlier this week that it would use replacement parts from factories elsewhere to reopen its Chevrolet Corvette factory in Bowling Green, Ky., and a sport utility vehicle factory in Silao, Mexico. Both assembly plants have been closed for more than a month, along with virtually all other G.M. assembly plants in North America, for lack of parts from the struck factories here.
7/24/1998	Give Workers a Say	To the Editor: The unraveling of cooperation between the United Automobile Workers and General Motors at the Saturn assembly plant (Editorial Observer, July 23) is an illustration of the inherent weakness of programs for labor-management cooperation. Agreements for worker and union participation in management decision making need a solid foundation of trust, now lacking at G.M. They also are fundamentally derived from management largess. Management expands and contracts shared decision making as it sees fit.
7/24/1998	G.M. and Union Still in Hearings	There was no end in sight today for the arbitration talks between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers. The closed-door hearings, which are focusing on the legality of labor strikes by G.M. workers in Flint, Mich., adjourned just before 5 P.M. and are scheduled to reconvene on Friday in Flint before the arbitrator, Thomas T. Roberts.
7/23/1998	Editorial Observer; Did You Notice? There's an Automobile Strike	There was a time when a strike that shut down General Motors, and hurt the economy, would have been at the top of the news every day. Public pressure for a settlement would have been intense. In those days, G.M. so dominated American auto production that Detroit feared antitrust action to break up the car maker. Then, the issues that divided the United Automobile Workers and the company were much easier to understand. The workers wanted more money, and management was reluctant to pay it.
7/22/1998	Labor's Peace With G.M. Unraveling at Saturn	The biggest question in the auto industry this summer is how the enormous factory here is still churning out Saturn cars a month after strikes at parts factories in Flint, Mich., forced every other General Motors assembly plant in the United States to close. The answer is that the 7,300 workers and their union have struck an uncomfortable bargain. In the name of preserving the nation's best-known experiment in cooperation between labor and management, they have set aside union solidarity by assembling cars using parts from Japan and at least one nonunion American company.
7/21/1998	The media wait anxiously as G.M., in wake of strikes, cuts back substantially on spending.	THE media are nervously assessing how much they may suffer as a result of the labor problems now hampering operations at the General Motors Corporation. ''What can we do except cry a little bit?'' Brian McMahon, senior vice president and group publisher at Car and Driver and Road & Track magazines in Los Angeles, asked rhetorically. ''We just hope it ends quickly.''
7/21/1998	Administration Staying Out Of G.M. Strikes, for Now	Last year, the Clinton Administration blocked a strike against American Airlines and leaped in to resolve a walkout against the United Parcel Service. But 46 days into strikes at the General Motors Corporation that have idled 26 factories and more than 186,000 workers, the Administration has made no such move. President Clinton has not even mentioned the dispute publicly for more than a month, and he spoke about it then only in answer to a question. ''I would like to encourage the parties to work it out,'' he said then.
7/20/1998	Saturn Workers Vote to Authorize Strike	Workers at the General Motors Corporation's Saturn factory, which was once a model of cooperation between labor and management, voted overwhelmingly today to authorize their leaders to call a strike to protest G.M.'s moves this spring to buy more auto parts from outside suppliers. The strike authorization, which carried with 95 percent of the vote, was the latest sign of the worker dissatisfaction that has swept the world's largest auto maker since workers went on strike at two parts factories here seven weeks ago. The Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., is the only G.M. assembly plant in the United States still producing vehicles; other factories have been forced to close for lack of parts.
7/20/1998	Like Father, Like Son, In Judgment of U.A.W.	Few cities are as lastingly seared by a single event as Flint has been by the sit-down strikes in early 1937, a violent showdown between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers that led to the union's first contract to represent the workers of a major auto maker. People still remember whether their parents and grandparents sided with labor or management when thousands of auto workers seized G.M. factories here, sitting on the floors after wielding 20-inch wooden clubs to drive off the police. At the company's request, a state judge, Paul V. Gadola Sr., ordered the strikers evicted, and the National Guard was deployed. The occupation of the factories ended quietly nine days later when the Governor, Frank Murphy, mediated a settlement.
7/19/1998	Powerboats, Picket Lines: Strikers Are Getting By	THE auto workers who have been walking picket lines outside two General Motors parts factories here for the last six weeks receive just $150 a week in strike benefits from their union, a paltry sum that conjures up images of workers living on bologna sandwiches and worrying that their houses and cars might soon be repossessed. But for most of the workers, the reality could not be more different -- a fact that helps to explain both why they are striking and why the United Automobile Workers union is in no hurry to settle with the world's biggest auto maker.
7/18/1998	G.M. and Union Agree to Start Arbitration on Wednesday	General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union said today that they would begin meeting with an arbitrator on Wednesday to resolve the legality of the union's crippling strikes here against the company, as bargaining between the two sides remained deadlocked. G.M. and U.A.W. officials will meet in Detroit with Thomas Roberts, a 74-year-old arbitrator from California best known for having resolved many baseball salary disputes over the years. U.A.W. officials had supported arbitration but had resisted any quick hearing until a Federal judge, responding to a lawsuit by G.M., asked the two sides here two days ago to move more quickly.
7/16/1998	Judge Asks G.M. and Union to Set Arbitration Date	A Federal judge asked General Motors and the United Automobile Workers today to schedule a date for the arbitration of strikes at two auto parts factories here as top negotiators from the auto maker and union talked face to face for the first time in three days. Judge Paul V. Gadola Jr. did not grant G.M.'s request for an order that arbitration begin immediately. But he urged both sides to agree by Tuesday on a date to meet with an arbiter, Thomas Roberts. G.M. and the U.A.W. said they would comply.
7/15/1998	G.M. Says Strikes Led to Earnings Drop	The General Motors Corporation announced today that its profits plunged 81 percent in the second quarter, mainly because of strikes here. The auto maker also filed a lawsuit demanding that the United Automobile Workers union allow immediate arbitration of the dispute. In apparent retaliation, the U.A.W. tonight scheduled a strike vote this Sunday at G.M.'s giant Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn.
7/14/1998	The Face-Off at G.M.	It began 39 days ago as a simple strike at a single General Motors factory over how modern-day workers should build fenders and hoods. But like two neighborhood toughs daring each other with escalating taunts, G.M. and the United Automobile Workers union have fallen into a dispute so big, complicated and destructive that a solution now seems more elusive than ever. The strike has forced G.M. to lay off 165,000 workers across North America and close 26 of 29 assembly plants. Any hope of resolving it soon was dealt a big setback this weekend when both sides threw up their hands in frustration.
7/13/1998	High-Level Talks Collapse In General Motors Strike	Frustrated by deadlocked talks to end a crippling strike at two auto parts factories here, the chief negotiator for General Motors announced late this afternoon that he would return to his office in Detroit, while the top union negotiator warned that it would be difficult to settle the strike before mid-August. The company's top negotiator, Gerald Knechtel, vice president for North American personnel, said that G.M., the world's largest auto maker, would pursue a three-week-old legal grievance against the United Automobile Workers union. The company has accused the union of using the parts factories to stage an illegal national strike although G.M.'s national agreement with the U.A.W. has more than a year to run. The union denies the accusation, and the issue will go to arbitration.
7/12/1998	VOICES: VIEWPOINT; An Old Strategy Is Backfiring At G.M.	Viewpoint article by John Schnapp, recently retired auto industry consultant, holds General Motors' greatest weakness is its strategy of making parts in-house at higher cost; drawing (M)
7/12/1998	Divergent Interests	A 37-day strike against two General Motors auto parts factories here has proved difficult to settle as the company and the United Automobile Workers union continue to raise the stakes, making it harder to compromise. The strikes are about very local issues: work rules, equipment investments and job security at the two factories here and at several other General Motors factories where workers have also been talking about striking.
7/11/1998	G.M. Negotiations Are Stalled Over Pledge for No More Strikes	Negotiations to settle a 36-day strike at two General Motors auto parts factories here slowed to a crawl today as G.M. stiffened its demand for a guarantee that workers at several factories elsewhere would not go on strike later this year. Gerald A. Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president for North American personnel, said the company could not conclude a deal here without being sure of labor peace at a truck parts factory in Indianapolis, a car and engine assembly plant here and two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio. ''We want the risk removed,'' he said.
7/10/1998	In G.M. Strike, Sides Disagree On Early Pact	Top negotiators for the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union disagreed today on the likelihood of a settlement by Monday in the most expensive strike to hit G.M. in a generation. In conversations with reporters here, Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for G.M. issues at the U.A.W., and Gerald Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president for labor relations, said they were pressing for a settlement before the auto maker's two-week summer shutdown ended on Monday but conceded talks were moving slowly.
7/9/1998	Little Progress Seen in Strike Talks Between G.M. and U.A.W.	Negotiators made steady progress today to resolve a monthlong strike at General Motors auto parts factories here, but more signs emerged that a deal here would resolve local disputes but might not produce big improvements in G.M.'s competitiveness. G.M. and United Automobile Workers union bargainers met at two struck factories and a local hotel today. Local union officials said that some of their grievances had been resolved, although they cautioned that tough issues remained in the dispute over work rules and worker safety. Both sides have been trying to reach a deal by Thursday or Friday, which would allow time for the 9,200 striking workers to vote on ratification over the weekend.
7/8/1998	Making Threats and Losing Cash in G.M. Strike	A monthlong strike by the United Automobile Workers against the General Motors Corporation is starting to drain the cash reserves of both sides and is prompting G.M. in particular to begin reviewing ways to save money. G.M. and the U.A.W. both have enormous financial strength, and neither needs to call a truce soon for lack of money. But the erosion of G.M.'s market share as the company's dealers run out of cars and light trucks poses a more serious risk to the company and its employees. Some lost customers may defect to rival auto makers and never come back, G.M. executives warn, and some U.A.W. officials privately acknowledge.
7/8/1998	Paris Aghast at Mere Hint of U.S. Stake in the Tower	Sell the Eiffel Tower to the Americans? Mayor Jean Tiberi of Paris was as outraged at the idea today as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City might be at a suggestion that the Brooklyn Bridge was for sale. ''There is no risk to the ownership of this monument,'' Mr. Tiberi assured fellow Gaullists in a stormy City Council meeting this morning, after conservative renegades trying to unseat him spread the alarm that a subsidiary of GMAC, the financial arm of the General Motors Corporation, was on the verge of acquiring operating rights to the tower.
7/7/1998	Disputed Hourly Pay Rule at Heart of G.M. Strike	Until the strike began a month ago, Steven M. White's work day at a General Motors parts factory here followed a familiar routine. Arriving at 6:30 every morning, he stood at an assembly line welding steel rails in semidarkness, wearing heavy protective clothing in a factory with no air-conditioning and temperatures exceeding 100 degrees on summer days. Mr. White's job has been to grab a 30-pound, 6-foot-long steel rail from a conveyor belt with his right hand, pull it across to his left hand, lower it into a brace and weld a bumper bracket on the side. He has to do the work partly by feel, he said, because a low ceiling was erected several years ago over his place on the line to ward off a leak in the 45-year-old factory's roof, and no light has been installed under the ceiling.
7/5/1998	As Apple Pie as Tail Fins and Burning Rubber; Corvette: Now That's American	NO modern car on the American road is more red-white-and-blue blooded than the Chevrolet Corvette. Introduced as a 1953 model, it was America's first true mass-produced sports car. It was America's answer, as well, to the pint-size roadsters that were being imported from Europe or shipped home by G.I.'s stationed there after World War II who had discovered their lithe, open-air charms.
7/5/1998	As Apple Pie as Tail Fins and Burning Rubber; Cadillac DeVille: Lost Generations	AFTER decades in which Cadillac represented the epitome of American luxury cars, it plans to sell its first truck this fall, a sport utility vehicle akin to the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon. Cadillac dealers are overjoyed. At last they will have something for a hot part of the market. Actually, the other sizzling part of the market is the luxury segment, though you might not be able to tell by hanging out in a Cadillac showroom. Sales of luxury cars rose last year more than sales of sport utilities, mini-vans and pickup trucks.
7/4/1998	Bit of Progress In Talks to End Strikes at G.M.	Negotiators from the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation have begun a push to resolve strikes in Flint that have crippled the giant auto maker's operations across North America, but the two sides have yet to settle G.M.'s demands for improved productivity here. Norwood Jewell, the often-combative chairman of the bargaining committee for the local U.A.W. unit that began the strikes on June 5, said in an interview here today that the tone of the talks had definitely improved and that negotiations would continue over the holiday weekend. After weeks of criticizing G.M. publicly, and even canceling talks temporarily over a perceived slight to striking workers by a G.M. negotiator, Mr. Jewell refrained from attacking the company today.
7/3/1998	G.M. Dealers See Dwindling Supply of Hot Models	Ask David White Jr., a Chevrolet dealer here, how long he can last during the current strikes against without running out of vehicles, and his initial response is full of confidence: two months, because he has about 220 new cars and trucks in stock and typically sells 110 a month. But ask about supplies of specific models, and the confidence fades to dismay. There are lots of slow-selling Lumina and Prism sedans, plenty of Astro full-size vans and enough tiny Metro economy cars for at least six months of sales. By contrast, he expects to sell the last of his high-profit Tahoe and Suburban sport utility vehicles and S-10 pickups this weekend, with no prospect of further deliveries until early August even if the strikes end quickly.
7/2/1998	G.M.'s June Sales Soared; Strikes to Hurt July's	The General Motors Corporation said today that June car and truck sales were the highest for any month in nine years but that July sales would plummet because of two strikes that have shut down most of the auto maker's North American assembly plants. Ronald L. Zarrella, vice president in charge of G.M.'s North American Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing Group, said at a news conference today that sales would drop 30 percent to 40 percent this month compared with sales from the month a year earlier because of the strikes by the United Automobile Workers. That would push G.M.'s market share to a record low of 25 percent and put G.M. behind the Ford Motor Company as the largest volume vehicle manufacturer in the United States. Already, analysts say the strikes at two plants in Flint, Mich., have cost G.M. $1.18 billion.
6/27/1998	Money and Other Hardening Positions in Strikes at G.M.	Losses to the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union from strikes at two parts factories here have soared far beyond the actual money involved at the factories, making it harder with each passing day for either side to paint an eventual settlement as a victory. Wall Street analysts now estimate G.M.'s after-tax costs from the strikes at $1 billion, and rising by $75 million a day, while the U.A.W.'s members have lost more than $150 million in pay. Based on previous strikes, G.M. and its workers can expect to recoup up to half their losses through extra production and overtime pay in the months after the strikes. But the rest of the losses are likely to be permanent, as customers buy Ford Expeditions and Toyota Camrys instead of Chevrolet Suburbans and Luminas.
6/25/1998	G.M. Calls Strikes Illegal and Threatens Jobless Benefits	General Motors said today that two strikes in Michigan that have crippled its car and truck production were illegal, taking an unusually hard stance against its national union over local walkouts. The company said in a statement that it would seek to take the United Automobile Workers to expedited arbitration and wanted a response from the union within 48 hours. The company also plans to block payments of unemployment benefits to idled workers. G.M. tried a similar tactic in a 1996 strike in Dayton, Ohio, but almost all states granted unemployment benefits.
6/24/1998	A 20-Year G.M. Parts Migration To Mexico	In one of General Motors' sprawling auto parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour producing instrument panels and steering wheels for G.M. cars and trucks. Until just a few years ago, United States workers earning close to $22 an hour at G.M.'s Delphi East factory in Flint, Mich., made the instrument panels. And those at a plant to the north in Saginaw produced the steering wheels.
6/23/1998	Looking to Long Term May Hurt G.M. Workers	To the Editor: Charles H. Fine's argument (Op-Ed, June 20) that the United Automobile Workers, rather than shutting down General Motors, ''would be better off considering how it might thrive in the long term, given the realities of the automotive industry'' is all too familiar to union and nonunion workers who have lost jobs to the global economy.
6/23/1998	Subtext of the G.M. Strike Focuses on Global Strategy	Crippling strikes at General Motors parts factories have left the United Automobile Workers union and G.M. fighting over whether the auto maker is pursuing an ''America Last'' strategy, but the reality lies somewhere between their positions. The U.A.W. is accusing the General Motors Corporation of spending billions of dollars on factories in developing countries while failing to invest in aging American factories. G.M. has responded by publicizing what it called plans to invest $21 billion in the United States by 2001.
6/23/1998	G.M. to Expand Investment In Building Trucks in China	The General Motors Corporation announced today that it would invest $100 million in a joint venture with a Chinese company to make pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in northeastern China. Coming on top of G.M.'s $1.5 billion project to assemble a Buick-style passenger car in Shanghai, the new plan reflects optimism about the car market in China.
6/22/1998	Distrust and Fear in the G.M. Strike	The United Automobile Workers' strike against General Motors in Flint, Mich., is an indication of just how deep distrust can still run in an industry where workers and management all too often have seen each other as enemies whose every action is viewed with hostility. This strike began in that atmosphere. Each side believes the other failed to live up to promises made more than a year ago. The company says workers are refusing to implement agreements to improve productivity, while the workers accuse management of not making promised investments to improve the plant and fear management secretly wants to move their jobs to Mexico or to non-union suppliers. Neither side thinks it can rely on the word of the other, and there is no sign that the strike, which began June 5, will end soon. Workers and the company are suffering as the strike forces G.M. to close most of its North American assembly lines.
6/20/1998	G.M. Chief Urges Strike's End as 23d Plant Is Shut	The chairman of the General Motors Corporation called today for a speedy resolution of the two-week strike that has shut down virtually all of the car maker's North American assembly plants and has idled more than 100,000 workers. ''We are committed to reaching a settlement as quickly as possible,'' John F. Smith, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said here during commencement ceremonies at Kettering University, the former General Motors Institute. The school is the alma mater of one-fourth of G.M.'s 72 corporate officers. ''Right now, nothing is more important,'' Mr. Smith added.
6/19/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Under the Hood: Computer Nerds?	AUTO MAKERS and their dealers are facing a severe shortage of automobile service technicians -- they used to be called ''mechanics'' before computer chips took over most of a car's functions. While the auto companies are recruiting newcomers, they are also looking for ways to help current workers do their jobs more efficiently and precisely. To that end, technicians at three Cadillac dealerships are testing a new computer technology developed by the General Motors Service Technology Group that lets them call up reams of service information with a spoken request. Called Smart Mentor, the system includes a small computer that can be worn by the technician and is equipped with software that guides him through the diagnostic and repair process.
6/19/1998	Big 3 Copy One Another Except in Labor Relations	This city's auto executives have a strong herd instinct, imitating one another's most popular car designs and living in the same neighborhoods, but they could not be more different in their approaches to labor relations as this month's strike against General Motors has shown. Stuck in its 16th strike in the last five years, G.M. has publicly lashed out this week at the United Automobile Workers. By contrast, Ford has not had a strike in 12 years and its executives play golf with U.A.W. leaders. Chrysler's approach lies somewhere in between, with prolonged periods of calm interrupted by occasional strikes that are usually settled behind closed doors with little public acrimony.
6/19/1998	Short Supplies Imperil The Year-End Closeout	THE best time to buy a new car is August or September, right? Perhaps not this year: The end-of-the-model-year clearance may have already begun. Sellers usually offer their best deals in late summer and early fall, as dealers try to clear their lots and showrooms to make room for the next year's models. This year, however, supplies are already low, thanks to a hearty economy, near-record vehicle sales, generous sales incentives and a spreading auto worker strike against the General Motors Corporation. With fewer cars to sell, manufacturers are likely to cut back on their inducements to buyers.
6/18/1998	U.S. Rethinking a Satellite Deal Over Links to Chinese Military	Faced with growing criticism of its satellite exports to China, the Clinton Administration is rethinking whether to allow one of the biggest sales to date, a $650 million deal President Clinton quietly approved two years ago. Government officials said the Pentagon and State Department were raising new questions about whether a Chinese-controlled company with close ties to China's military should be allowed to buy the satellites, which contain some of the United States' most sophisticated communications equipment.
6/18/1998	Auto Workers' Strike: Showdown on Job Protection	The 12-day-old strike against General Motors began as a little-watched local dispute at a single metal-shaping plant here, but the walkout has quickly snowballed into a strike of national importance. Now 20 more plants are closed as parts shortages created by the strike have shut down most operations at the world's largest auto maker, a company accounting for 1.5 percent of the nation's economic output.
6/18/1998	Popular Issue Drives G.M. Strike	The strikes now crippling General Motors, while partly about short-term job security and workplace safety disputes, reflect a larger struggle over how far G.M. will go in adopting at home the manufacturing techniques it is introducing abroad. G.M.'s operations in Brazil have copied Japanese manufacturing practices and have become the company's most profitable, efficient and flexible. When G.M. introduced new midsize sedans in the United States and Brazil two years ago, a Kansas factory took seven months to make the switch while the Brazilian factory reached full production in three months.
6/17/1998	G.M.'s Plant in Brazil Raises Fears Closer to Home	General Motors' North American operations moved closer to being shut down completely today, as strikes at two Michigan parts factories forced the company to idle 13,000 more workers and partly close a host of other parts and assembly plants. The combined work stoppages, one at a sheet-metal stamping plant that began 11 days ago and the other at a spark plug and speedometer plant that began on Thursday, have now sent 63,100 workers home and closed more than 40 assembly and parts factories in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Nearly all G.M. cars and trucks require parts built at one of the two plants in Flint, Mich., where 9,000 workers are walking picket lines.
6/16/1998	G.M. Closes More Plants; Talks Falter	It is easy to overlook the two major highways crisscrossing this city as just a pair of well-worn roads. But these roads are emblems of a rich slice of American history. One is named the Chevrolet-Buick, in honor of the General Motors Corporation, which began its automobile empire here, putting food on the tables and cars in the driveways of generation after generation. The other highway is called the U.A.W., a tribute to the labor giant, the United Auto Workers, that rose here in a legendary 1936 sit-down strike on the factory floor of a now shuttered General Motors assembly plant. Together, the roads are ordinary yet glaring symbols of just how tightly this city is gripped by its two most famous offspring.
6/15/1998	Flint Journal; City G.M. Built Looks Ahead Warily	Strikes at two General Motors parts factories forced the auto maker to close some of its most profitable assembly plants today, increasing the number of temporarily laid-off workers to 50,900. But tensions started to ease in the dispute as negotiators began making slow progress. Talks had been paralyzed until late Thursday by the fury of union leaders over G.M.'s tactics before the strikes. The company removed parts-making equipment over Memorial Day weekend from one of the two factories where workers have since gone on strike.
6/13/1998	End of the Line For a Parts Factory	Nearly 6,000 workers went on strike this evening at a General Motors factory in Flint, Mich., joining fellow strikers at a nearby G.M. plant in an increasingly bitter fight that could close virtually all of the company's North American assembly plants within days. G.M., the world's largest auto maker, had already closed seven of those assembly plants and temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts from the initial strike last Friday at a metal-stamping plant in Flint. Most of G.M.'s 22 other assembly plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico are expected to quickly run out of the spark plugs, speedometers and other parts made by the giant factory where workers walked out this evening.
6/13/1998	As G.M. Idles Plants, Talks Make Progress	Strike by 3,400 UAW workers at General Motors Corp metal stamping factory in Flint, Mich, has closed seven assembly plants from Kansas to Canada and part of three other plants, idling more than 18,000 workers by GM's count; 5,000 workers at second parts-making factory in Flint are expected to decide whether to strike over what they call unmet job security demands; auto analysts say strike in Flint, Mich, will ripple across North America within days, quickly shutting most of 22 assembly plants not yet affected by metal-stamping plant strike, causing hundreds of temporary layoffs at independent parts supply companies and depleting dealer inventories of cars and trucks; economists say combined work stoppage could trim nation's production of goods and services by $6 billion, on yearly basis, if settlement is not reached before end of month; chart; photo (M)
6/12/1998	6,000 G.M. WORKERS AT MICHIGAN PLANT JOIN AUTO STRIKE	In one of the first attempts by major companies to counter the high air fares charged by the major airlines, the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation are near an agreement to pay a monthly fee for five years to Pro Air, a start-up airline based in Detroit, in exchange for unlimited passage on the carrier for their employees. The innovative deal will help Pro Air, which is not yet a year old and flies to just half a dozen destinations, compete against Northwest Airlines, by far the dominant carrier in Detroit. And it will save Chrysler and G.M. as much as $3 million and $6 million a year, respectively, they said.
6/11/1998	G.M. to Develop Pickup Truck With Isuzu	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker, said yesterday that it would develop a pickup truck with Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan for sale in the United States, Europe and Brazil. Isuzu, which is 37.5 percent owned by General Motors, will supply the chassis -- which includes the engine, axle and frame -- for the one-ton pickup truck, Isuzu's president, Kazuhira Seki, said. The agreement could grow to include sport utility vehicles, said Toru Kajiyama, an Isuzu managing director.
6/9/1998	Supreme Court Roundup; Right of States to Extradite Fugitives Is Upheld	States have an unalterable duty to return other states' fugitives, the Supreme Court ruled today in a unanimous opinion that gave the New Mexico Supreme Court no choice but to extradite an escaped parolee whom the state court had deemed to be a ''refugee from injustice'' in the Ohio prison system. Even accepting as ''credible'' the fugitive's testimony that he faced serious threats of injury at the hands of prison officials if returned to custody in Ohio, the Court said, ''this is simply not the kind of issue that may be tried in the asylum state.''
6/9/1998	Strike Idles Other G.M. Plants And Workers Are Sent Home	With two of its factories running out of essential components, the General Motors Corporation sent 4,500 workers home today as a four-day strike at a metal stamping plant in Flint, Mich., threatened to halt vehicle production for the world's largest auto maker. While negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors began their fourth straight day of bargaining, assembly factories in Orion Township, Mich., and Kansas City, Kan., were closed because of a shortage of engine cradles, the company and union officials said. Salaried employees remained at the plants.
6/4/1998	Vehicle Sales Are Highest Since 1986	The nation's auto industry reported that May was the best month for car and truck sales since September 1986, with sales totaling 1,511,661 cars and trucks, a 12.1 percent increase from the corresponding period last year. Moreover, fueled by hefty price discounts, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars and trucks last month, the highest level since October 1987.
5/23/1998	He Wants You In Driver's Seat; Marketing G.M. Brands As if They Were Detergent	It was an open invitation either to career swashbuckling or to career suicide: the General Motors Corporation, the world's biggest company and America's biggest advertiser, was looking for a new marketing guru four years ago. Ronald L. Zarrella, president of the Bausch & Lomb Corporation, a maker of contact lenses and sunglasses, took the bait. Some people thought he was crazy. General Motors was one of the nation's most hidebound companies, one that seldom hired outsiders even for low-level executive posts. It had a tradition of notoriously muddled marketing. Yet here was a new marketing chief who knew nothing about cars, trying to impose a new sales strategy called brand management imported from Procter & Gamble and other consumer products companies. In essence, he was asking the macho engineers and finance types who held sway at the auto maker to start marketing cars the way other companies peddled cookies.
5/22/1998	Auto Makers Seek to Make Light Trucks Safer in Crashes	Auto makers have quietly begun trying to design sport utility vehicles that will be less dangerous to other motorists. Ford has secretly begun redesigning the suspensions for the Ford Explorer and Expedition, the Mercury Mountaineer, the Lincoln Navigator and future sport utility models so the vehicles will ride as much as several inches lower and be less likely to override cars' bumpers and other safety features during crashes, a Ford manager said. General Motors has designed a prototype for a new Chevrolet Suburban that also rides lower and is test-driving it.
5/16/1998	Radio Ad Marketer Apologizes for Memo Offending Minorities	A New York company that sells national advertising for radio stations apologized yesterday for an internal strategy document whose disclosure caused a furor among operators of radio stations catering to black and Hispanic audiences. In the memo, prepared by a division of Katz Radio Group, sales representatives were instructed to discourage corporations from placing commercials on these stations by telling them that ''advertisers should want prospects, not suspects.''
5/8/1998	Mergers Help Fuel a Two-Tier Global Auto Hierarchy	The global auto industry is increasingly divided into two tiers, as a half-dozen giant companies prosper while many of their smaller rivals struggle to manage heavy debts or afford the ever-rising cost of designing new cars. With the pending completion of today's acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G., each of the world's three major auto-producing regions will have two successful, global auto makers. Toyota and Honda are thriving in Japan. General Motors and Ford are enjoying record profits in the United States. Volkswagen and the new DaimlerChrysler, which will have German and American executives but will be dominated by European shareholders, will be the strongest auto makers based in Europe.
5/7/1998	Risking Labor Trouble and Clash Of Cultures, 2 Makers Opt for Size	A quarter of a century ago, most auto makers were convinced that the only way to thrive was to imitate a then-wealthy General Motors and become as big as possible, producing cars of every size and shape and selling them in every market around the globe. After many years in disrepute, the same theory is back in fashion now and is fully reflected in the planned merger of Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation.
5/6/1998	April's Auto Sales Prove Unexpectedly Strong	The auto industry turned in unexpectedly strong April sales results today, the first month this year in which customers bought more cars and trucks than they did during the same period of last year. The sales spurt came as heavy mortgage refinancings in the first quarter of the year gave buyers extra money to spend on monthly car payments while hefty rebates drew them to showrooms.
5/2/1998	Chrysler Reports 8.2% Sales Jump, As Car Makers Push Big Rebates	In auto dealer showrooms nationwide, rebate skirmishes have given way to an all-out price war, with the Big Three American auto makers promising buyers ever-bigger discounts and even honoring competitors' $1,000-off coupons. The effort to pump up sluggish sales, which had barely gotten under way last month, seems to be working: analysts estimate that auto sales rose 2 to 4 percent in April, and are likely to jump further this month.
5/1/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Downshift, Download: Commuting as Work	CARS used to provide a refuge from the corporate office, a place to unwind on the way home. No one knew just where you were, and no one could reach you. Then came cellular telephones, and you could be tracked down as though you were at your desk. The laptop computer and in-car fax machine made it possible for Type A overachievers to work in traffic jams. Soon, if a few new concept vehicles are any indication, you will be receiving and answering E-mail messages, even surfing the Internet, while commuting.
5/1/1998	Coming Soon to a Mini-Van Near You	WHATEVER happened to license plate bingo? Now, children are entertained in cars by video games and compact disks. And as auto makers seek new ways to set their vehicles apart from competitors', they are offering more features to entertain children -- insuring a peaceful ride for parents. A new version of the Oldsmobile Silhouette mini-van will be available by mid-month with a videocassette player for the rear passengers. The player comes on the fanciest Silhouette, the Premier, priced at $31,175. (The base Silhouette is $24,535.)
4/26/1998	European Auto Divisions Calling for Improved Fuel Economy	The European operations of Ford and General Motors are supporting a plan by European auto makers to raise the average fuel economy of cars sold in Europe by nearly 20 percent, to 39 miles per gallon, even as the North American operations of both auto makers resist pressures to improve the far worse fuel economy of family vehicles here. The split within the world's two largest auto makers reflects two factors: gasoline taxes and global warming. Fuel economy is more important to car buyers overseas because gasoline in most industrialized nations can cost four times as much as in the United States because of higher taxes. Pressure from environmental regulators to reduce the consumption of gasoline and slow emissions of gases that contribute to global warming is also greater across the Atlantic than in the United States.
4/25/1998	Chrysler Joins Discounts	The Chrysler Corporation matched its rivals Ford and General Motors today by offering discounts of $500 to $1,000 on new-vehicle purchases to millions of owners of its cars and trucks. Ford said on Wednesday that it would offer similar coupons to millions of owners of its models, while General Motors announced its program on April 10. The so-called loyalty coupon discounts are designed to keep owners from defecting to a rival auto maker.
4/21/1998	G.M. Chief Gets Larger Bonus	John F. Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, received a bonus of nearly $2.5 million in 1997, up 53 percent from a 1996 bonus of $1.6 million, the auto maker said yesterday. In a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, G.M. said that Mr. Smith's annual salary in 1997 was about $1.8 million, unchanged from a year earlier, bringing his total 1997 salary and bonus compensation to roughly $4.2 million, up 24 percent from the $3.4 million he received in 1996.
4/18/1998	G.M. Earnings Hint at Trouble Later This Year	The General Motors Corporation worried Wall Street today by reporting first-quarter earnings that suggested underlying weaknesses in the company's prospects later this year. While General Motors' bottom line benefited from cost-cutting worth $1.2 billion in the first quarter, and from selling a greater percentage of high-profit sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks, earnings suffered from a sharp increase in rebates and other incentives offered to improve the company's sluggish sales. Those marketing costs rose 51.7 percent, to an average of $1,305 a vehicle sold in the first quarter, up from $860 in the first quarter of last year.
4/16/1998	The Road Ford's Taken; Auto Maker Places Biggest Bet Yet on the Behemoths	After years of cranking out low-profit heavy-truck tractors through a maze of conveyor belts and robot welders covering more than 100 acres here, North America's largest auto factory has a new product. And it is beginning to earn a fortune for the Ford Motor Company. When Ford sold its heavy-truck business to Daimler-Benz A.G. last year, the company began building Super Duty pickups here instead. The profitable new pickups, which are taller than Michael Jordan, with front seats that are nearly four feet off the ground, have been an instant hit since they went on sale in February. To keep them selling, and the profits rolling, Ford has brought in a thousand workers from unprofitable car factories in Ohio and has just begun operating the factory here around the clock.
4/15/1998	G.M. to Expand a Metal-Casting Plant	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would invest $170 million to expand its Michigan metal-casting plant and install new technology to make aluminum engine blocks and cylinder heads. The expansion means the factory in Saginaw will keep 440 workers whose jobs would have been eliminated by improved technology, said Joe Lawrence, a spokesman. It could also create the need to add workers later. The project will begin this quarter and last three and a half years.
4/8/1998	Side Air Bags To Be Offered On More Cars	Side air bags will soon be much more common in cars on the American road. The Ford Motor Company, expressing concern about the death rate of people in cars hit from the side, plans to announce on Wednesday that it will offer side air bags on all of its cars and Ford Windstar mini-vans over the next several years, company officials said today.
4/4/1998	Rise by G.M. Trims Decline In Auto Sales	Auto sales fell 1.7 percent last month, but the decline would have been steeper without a rebate-fueled sales drive by the General Motors Corporation that helped obscure weak results at many other auto makers. G.M. said today that its sales rose 3.7 percent in March, compared with the 1997 period, helping pull up the results for the industry as a whole. The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales fell 2.6 percent.
4/1/1998	2 Auto Makers Weigh Unit Sale	The Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation said today that they might sell their joint-venture parts unit, New Venture Gear Inc., to cut costs while giving the business a chance to expand with other customers. New Venture Gear, a transmission-parts maker based in Troy, Mich., could fetch as much as $700 million, analysts said. The company, which employs 5,000 at plants in New York and Indiana, has $1.3 billion in annual sales, a Chrysler spokesman said.
3/29/1998	Go West: New Sport Brutes Square Off on the Utah Buttes	MONUMENT VALLEY, that collection of impossibly beautiful buttes, mesas, canyons and valleys in southeast Utah and northeast Arizona, is an excellent place to test the mettle of sport utility vehicles. There are great roads, good roads, bad roads, rocky roads, dirt roads and no roads, with natural wonders waiting no matter which route you take. Three couples, including four automotive writers, gathered in Southern California in late January with a mission: We would take the pulse of five newborn sport utility vehicles on a 2,200-mile trip through the desert Southwest, seeing how they compared in the kind of environment for which they are designed (but all too rarely see).
3/24/1998	Patterns	Fashion Lets G.M. Drive General Motors Fashion Week will not mean a parade of G.M.'s latest cars. The company, which has been a prominent supporter of Seventh on Sixth, the organizers of the American shows, is to become the shows' primary sponsor. The move will engender a name change for the shows, and it has resulted in a long-awaited television deal for designers. An hourlong television special, behind the scenes of the shows, is to be presented by G.M., said Fern Mallis, the executive director of Seventh on Sixth. It will be filmed during show week and broadcast at its conclusion, on April 4 at 7 P.M. on WNBC-TV in New York. ''Inside Fashion Week'' will be produced twice a year and will include the men's shows.
3/21/1998	G.M. Pulls Out the Stops in Fight for Market Share	Surf through prime time television and you can count on many shows having one thing in common: they'll be interrupted by a lot of advertisements for General Motors' cars and trucks. The company is trying to reverse a sharp decline in its market share this year and is hoping the onslaught of ads, some offering fresh rebates and heavily discounted financing, will lure buyers.
3/20/1998	A Social-Climbing Sport Utility	IN a feat of competitive catch-up, the General Motors Corporation says it has cut the the time it takes to design and build new cars and trucks by six months. Further, it promises another six-month improvement by the end of this year, matching its domestic competitors. G.M. executives have confirmed that the company moved a new vehicle concept from the design studio to the factory floor in just 30 months, beating its previous record of 36 months. And G.M. says it will soon match its smaller American rivals, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, with a 24-month development cycle.
3/20/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology and Design; G.M. Speeds Up Car Development	After weeks of dissension in a workplace known for harmony, two-thirds of the workers at the Saturn car factory here voted down a measure that would have asked the company to jettison their current union contract, corporate America's most prominent continuing experiment in labor-management cooperation. A General Motors Corporation executive hailed the vote. ''The membership has spoken,'' said Donald W. Hudler, president and chairman of the board of Saturn, which is owned by G.M.
3/12/1998	Saturn Union Votes to Retain Its Cooperative Company Pact	Every week, hundreds of curious tourists make pilgrimages to this small town to take a tour of the Saturn factory. They watch yellow and orange conveyors flow through it like veins carrying car parts to the heart of the assembly line. Many come to see where their beloved Saturns were built. They wave at workers, who smile and wave back. Indeed, the scene resembles the touchy-feely image created by Saturn's advertising campaigns -- one of cheerful, dedicated Americans working in teams to build quality cars. But all is not well on the factory floor.
3/5/1998	Clinton Aides Spread Data Critical of Starr as Lawyer for G.M.	A week after the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, ordered a White House official before a grand jury to account for accusations spread about prosecutors, President Clinton's aides today circulated a batch of material critical of Mr. Starr's performance as a lawyer for the General Motors Corporation in the early 1990's. The material summarized a complaint filed on Monday by a South Carolina plaintiff's lawyer that asks the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Starr for obstruction of justice. The complaint, by J. Kendall Few, asserts that Mr. Starr sought to cover up perjured testimony in a civil lawsuit in which Mr. Few's clients had been injured in a car accident.
3/5/1998	Auto Sales Fell In February, Hurt by G.M.	Auto sales dipped slightly in the United States last month, as very weak car sales at the General Motors Corporation offset flat or rising sales at other companies, particularly the Chrysler Corporation and the Korean auto makers, which offered big rebates and other deals on small cars. G.M. announced today that its sales fell 7 percent in February from a year earlier, as a 2.5 percent increase in sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans failed to offset a 14.1 percent plunge in car sales. Because G.M. still holds nearly a third of the American auto market -- more than every foreign auto maker combined -- the weak sales at G.M. were enough to drag overall auto sales down by seven-tenths of 1 percent last month.
3/2/1998	Wheels and Deals; G.M. Executive Wields Enormous Influence With the Nation's Biggest Ad Budget	Standing among the shiny cars on display in the General Motors showroom on Fifth Avenue and wearing one of his signature designer suits -- a twinkle in his eye and a box of cigars tucked under his arm -- Philip Guarascio comes across as the kind of man who could easily sell you that moonstone Cadillac DeVille or the black Pontiac Grand Prix. Though he talks a blue streak, Mr. Guarascio is not a salesman. In fact, he is the media business's ultimate customer, the man who controls the biggest advertising budget in the country, the go-to guy for any magazine, newspaper or broadcast company hungry for a piece of G.M.'s ad business, which reached a record $2 billion last year.
2/26/1998	Auto Makers Taking Steps To Reduce Truck Threat	After nearly a year of dismissing concerns that the design of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks poses a threat to the safety of people in cars, the world's two largest auto makers are taking steps to address the problem. The Ford Motor Company has asked its auto parts suppliers for help in redesigning these vehicles, known as light trucks, to make them less dangerous. The General Motors Corporation has stepped up research on the safety of light trucks.
2/25/1998	LEAR IS GETTING DELPHI'S AUTOMOBILE SEAT UNIT	The Lear Corporation agreed yesterday to buy the automobile seat unit of Delphi Automotive Systems, which is a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, for an undisclosed price, adding a business with $1.2 billion in annual revenue. The sale, which analysts pegged at as much as $500 million, is part of Delphi's plan to shed unprofitable businesses before a possible public offering. Delphi sold its coil-spring business last week and said it would have a buyer within three weeks for its lighting unit. Delphi sells its parts to G.M. and other auto makers. Lear's stock fell $1.25 a share, to $52.75, while G.M. rose $2.1875, to $68.50.
2/22/1998	For a Los Angeles 'Suburb,' Steps to Recovery	A $75 MILLION complex that will combine a shopping center with an industrial park is rising here on the former site of a General Motors Corporation automobile plant. The project, which is called The Plant, is expected to regenerate most of the 3,000 jobs lost when the car maker closed its plant five years ago in this San Fernando Valley community of the City of Los Angeles.
2/19/1998	Auto Makers to Buy More From Minority-Owned Companies	The Clinton Administration has reached an agreement with the Big Three auto makers to increase their purchases from minority-owned companies by nearly $3 billion by the year 2001, officials from the Administration and the auto makers said today. According to these officials, representatives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler will sign an agreement on Thursday committing the auto makers to increase purchases from minority contractors to 5 percent of total procurement from the current 4.2 percent. The amount of contracts is to increase incrementally over three years starting this year.
2/15/1998	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Cadillac Seville STS; Is Cadillac Prepared To Take On the World?	ONCE the self-proclaimed ''Standard of the World,'' Cadillac wants the world to take it seriously again. Toward that end, it has created an all-new Seville that is more pointedly directed at the current standard bearers, the refined, world-class cars of BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. It will not be enough for this new Seville, redesigned inside and out and built with a more rigid body structure, to satisfy Americans. With the high-end luxury market showing little growth in the United States, Cadillac is aiming the Seville at buyers in 40 countries. Special versions are being produced for export, including right-hand-drive cars for places like Britain and Japan.
2/15/1998	Good Vibes and Bad Vibrations	A second driver, in a third Seville test car, had these observations: * Above the village of Woodstock, N.Y., the steep mountain lane is crusted with ice and dusted with snow. The driver, a cup of coffee at hand, gingerly eases onto a section that falls away sharply. As always at this spot, he pulls the shift knob to engage low gear, but the shifter remains stuck in second. He tries again. Is the transmission failing on a $51,000 car with just 600 miles on the odometer? No, Cadillac has simply designed a cup holder that, when open, keeps the shifter from moving back all the way.
2/10/1998	G.M. Announces Buyback Plan For $4 Billion More of Its Stock	The General Motors Corporation, which has been buying back stock in an effort to lift the price, said today that it would repurchase an additional $4 billion worth, or about 10 percent of the shares outstanding. Over the last 13 months, G.M. has announced plans to buy back a total of $9 billion in stock, or about 20 percent of its shares outstanding, in three installments. Wall Street analysts said they had not expected the size and timing of the latest announcement. ''It is a pleasant surprise,'' said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Analysts had been expecting a $2.5 billion buyback -- which would have matched the size of the two previous repurchases -- but not until April, he said.
2/5/1998	G.M. and Ford January Sales Fell Sharply	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company announced steep drops in January sales today, with all but the newest-model cars selling slowly. G.M. said its sales fell 6.3 percent last month compared with a year earlier. Its car sales plunged 18.3 percent, but its overall results were lifted by strong sales of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks, whose combined sales rose 10.1 percent last month.
2/5/1998	Big 3 to Make Cleaner Cars Than Required	General Motors, Ford and Chrysler said this evening that they would begin delivering cars next year that emit 70 percent less of some pollutants, in a deal with the Government on Federal pollution standards. Their agreement, which was immediately praised by the Environmental Protection Agency, consummates a deal on smog that has been in the works for most of this decade.
2/3/1998	G.M. and Daewoo Agree to Consider Variety of Business Ties	The General Motors Corporation and the Daewoo Group of South Korea announced today that they plan to go steady while negotiating a prenuptial agreement. After publicly courting each other for weeks, the two said they had signed a memorandum of understanding to consider a wide range of business ties. G.M. is considering taking a large equity stake in Daewoo's auto business, said Alan G. Perriton, president of G.M. Korea Inc., G.M.'s South Korean subsidiary. The companies also said today that they had already agreed to marry some of their operations: Daewoo dealerships will repair G.M. vehicles in 10 South Korean cities.
2/1/1998	Why Do People Quit Their Jobs? Because They Can	MIKE MITCHELL was perfectly happy last spring in his job as an employee communications specialist here for the Phelps Dodge Corporation. He liked his boss, had a lot of independence and felt challenged. He had just had his one-year review and it was positive. He received a raise.
1/27/1998	G.M. Reports Strong 4th-Quarter Earnings	The General Motors Corporation reported today that its earnings in the fourth quarter more than doubled to $1.74 billion, or $2.33 a share, from $786 million, or 91 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Despite the improvement, the numbers failed to wow Wall Street, since the results were roughly in line with analysts' expectations. The company's 1997 profits reached $6.7 billion, or $8.62 a share, up from $5.0 billion, or $6.02 a share, in 1996. G.M.'s revenue was $177.7 billion last year, up from $164 billion in 1996. Despite the rising profits, G.M. sold a lower proportion of cars and trucks worldwide than did its competitors. In the United States, G.M.'s market share dropped to 30.8 percent, from 31 percent, and worldwide it fell from 16.2 percent, to 16 percent last year.
1/21/1998	THE MARKETS: Market Place; G.M. is poking around Asia looking for good deals or alliances with beaten-down auto makers.	GENERAL MOTORS is kicking the tires of auto companies in Asia. Fire-sale prices from the crash of Asian currencies along with eased trade restrictions are rekindling a long-running desire by American auto companies to capture more of the Asian market.
1/16/1998	The Look May Be Familiar, But the Trucks Are All New	First, Dodge introduced a radically different Ram truck for 1994. Then Ford offered a distinctive, much improved F-150 in 1996. This fall, General Motors will try to regain momentum with new full-size pickups that replace designs dating to 1987. Prototypes of the 1999 Chevrolet Silverado, top right and interior view, and GMC Sierra, lower right, are on display at the Detroit auto show. The new models are larger and roomier, with stronger frames, more powerful V8 engines and standard four-wheel anti-lock brakes. But G.M. seems somewhat defensive about the evolutionary, conservative styling; a preview film features a Chevy owner who implies that stylish competing trucks are ''feminine.'' Last year, Ford's F-Series -- the most popular vehicle in the world -- outsold G.M.'s full-size trucks by 21,000.
1/14/1998	Justices Rule One State's Court Cannot Bind Another's Court to a Deal	In a case involving an automobile industry whistleblower, the Supreme Court ruled today that one state's court system cannot bind another's to an agreement barring particular testimony or evidence from a trial. The 9-to-0 decision was one of the Court's most significant recent rulings on the constitutional obligation of states to respect one another's legal judgments. It might curb efforts by corporations to silence whistleblowers by obtaining local court orders to bar their testimony in future lawsuits.
1/13/1998	Detroit's Big 3 Say Asia Is Forcing Cost Cuts	The Big Three American auto makers might be expected to pop champagne. After all, the stock market has soared, the economic expansion continues, and interest rates have fallen to record lows, all of which would normally lure buyers to showrooms. Instead, Detroit is acting almost as if a recession had hit, hunkering down to shave pennies wherever possible in an effort to cut costs sharply in the face of growing competition from Asia.
1/9/1998	A Number of Deals Are Made in Europe	There were several developments yesterday involving advertisers and agencies in Europe. Zenith Media Services, jointly owned by Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C. and Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., was named to handle worldwide media buying for Alcatel Alsthom S.A., the French electronics and telecommunications conglomerate. Those duties on the account, with billings estimated at $150 million, had been handled by various agencies including Optimum Media, part of Omnicom Group. The decision came after a review that included Zenith, which will handle the assignment from its London and Paris offices; Optimum; Mediapolis, a joint venture of Young & Rubicam Inc. and the Euro RSCG unit of Havas Advertising, and Carat Group S.A.
1/8/1998	Camry Holds Off Accord For Title of Best-Selling Car	After a race to the wire, the Toyota Camry beat the Honda Accord for the title of the nation's best-selling car in 1997, leaving the Ford Taurus in third place and ending its five-year reign as the top seller. Strong sales in December for Toyota, Honda and the General Motors Corporation left the auto industry as a whole with better-than-expected sales for the year. Auto makers sold 15.2 million vehicles in the United States last year, up from 15.1 million vehicles sold in 1996.
12/14/1997	Auto Stability System Gets A New Home, in '98 Corvette	YOU are cruising down a rain-slick highway when you spot a huge pothole just ahead. You swerve around it, then turn the steering wheel back sharply to return to your lane. The abrupt maneuver causes the back end of your car to fishtail, and you lose control. Electronic stability systems are designed to engage in such circumstances, preventing skids and spins and keeping the vehicle moving where you want it to go. First offered on high-end models, the systems are starting to show up elsewhere. And because they are relatively inexpensive, they are likely to become common on more models.
12/11/1997	GENERAL MOTORS MAKING OFFICIAL RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire a 49 percent equity stake in the Delta Motor Corporation of South Africa for an undisclosed price, signaling the world's largest auto maker's return to South Africa after 11 years. Delta was formed in 1986, when G.M. managers bought out G.M.'s South African manufacturing and marketing operations. G.M. left South Africa to protest the Government's apartheid racial policies, which have been abolished. Delta, which has 4,500 employees, assembles G.M.'s Opel-brand Corsa and Astra cars, Isuzu light pickups and other models and exports finished vehicles.
12/9/1997	Shanghai G.M. Selects Bates	The General Motors Corporation added Bates Worldwide to its agency roster yesterday as Shanghai General Motors, a joint venture of G. M. and the Shanghai Automobile Industrial Corporation, named Bates China in Shanghai as the first shop to handle its account. Billings were estimated at $15 million to $20 million.
12/7/1997	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Express; Berthing Those Babies	CHEVROLET has presented Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey a 1998 Chevy Express van so they can fetch home their septuplets, Iowa's neo-natal celebrities. My wife said it best: ''There must be easier ways to get a free van.'' But what a van. The McCaugheys' new ride is simply humongous, an extended-wheelbase version of Chevy's full-size-and-then-some passenger shuttle, nearly 20 feet long and able to carry in almost amniotic comfort 15 people and their luggage -- a claim not even Mother McCaughey can make.
12/5/1997	A City Built on Four Wheels and a Full Tank	I remember Detroit during its days of glory in the late 1940's, when the assembly lines were churning out the cars the country had gone without all during the war. It was a proud, self-confident city. My father took me there to watch the Tigers' great lefthander, Hal Newhouser. We would stay at the Statler or the Book-Cadillac, a pair of swell big-city hotels, shop for my mother at Hudson's, one of the nation's premier department stores, and eat dinner at Lester Gruber's London Chop House, a clublike restaurant that served better food and wine than any club I know of.
12/5/1997	Japan Car Deal Pressed by U.S.	The Clinton Administration complained today that Japan was not honoring a 1995 automotive trade agreement and requested intensified efforts by Japan to open its market. Sales in Japan by the Big Three dropped 20 percent during the first nine months of this year, while the pace in adding dealerships there slowed markedly, concluded the Government's task force that monitors compliance.
12/4/1997	Rise in Auto Sales in November Spurred by Demand for Trucks	Auto sales strengthened last month, rising 3.8 percent for the industry as a whole, compared with the similar period a year ago. Strong demand for trucks propelled the sales, which reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.2 million units in November. Sales of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks rose 8.5 percent last month, while car sales slid five-tenths of 1 percent. One reason for the strong results is that auto makers offered generous rebates and discounted finance rates in November.
11/24/1997	Havas Unit Wins A Project for Buick	The Buick division of the General Motors Corporation has named the Euro RSCG Tatham unit of Havas Advertising in Chicago to handle an undisclosed project. Mark A. Rollinson, a Buick spokesman in Flint, Mich., confirmed a report of the assignment last week in Adweek, describing it as a one-time project. Though he declined to discuss details, Adweek reported that it involved production of a film primarily for screening at auto shows as well as internally.
11/22/1997	G.M. to Close Car Factory, Delivering Big Blow to Flint	Faced with dwindling demand for large cars as more Americans switch to sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks, the General Motors Corporation announced today that it would close its 2,900-employee car factory in Flint, Mich., during the third quarter of 1999. The closing of the Buick City factory, which produces Pontiac Bonneville and Buick LeSabre sedans, will mark the end of an era for G.M., which was founded in Flint in 1908 and has been building cars there ever since. After the closing, G.M.'s vehicle production in Flint will be limited to pickup trucks and medium-duty commercial trucks.
11/21/1997	Auto Maker to Build Cadillac of Sport Utility Vehicles	For nearly a century, Cadillac has cultivated a reputation for building elegant cars. Now it wants to sell elegant trucks. After months of insisting there was no room in the American auto market for another luxury sport utility vehicle, Cadillac abruptly reversed course today and announced that it would offer such a vehicle next autumn. The engine, suspension system and the rest of the underbody of the new Cadillac vehicle will be based on General Motors' existing designs for full-size light trucks, including the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban sport utility vehicles and the Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickup trucks.
11/14/1997	Honda, Beating Out G.M., Plans to Build Cars in China	Beating out a competing bid by the General Motors Corporation, the Honda Motor Company announced today that it had won the right to manufacture passenger cars at a plant in southern China. Honda executives said the venture, their first auto assembly operation in China's perplexing car market, would involve a $200 million investment with two local partners to produce a model resembling the Honda Accord. Honda will take a 50 percent stake.
11/14/1997	Brazilian Slowdown Forces Rethinking and Retrenching	Southeast Asian auto sales have collapsed, and now the other shoe has dropped for the world's biggest auto makers. After years of spectacular growth, the Brazilian auto market -- the largest of any emerging-market country -- is facing a severe slowdown as the Government there has doubled interest rates, raised income taxes and slashed spending to prevent Asia's currency turmoil from spreading across the Pacific.
11/12/1997	3 Dealer Groups Select Gianettino	Three additional dealer groups that sell cars and trucks for the Chevrolet division of the General Motors Corporation have awarded their accounts to Gianettino & Meredith in Short Hills, N.J. The assignments bring the agency's total Chevrolet dealer group billings to more than $22 million. The three groups are: Five Boro, covering New York City; Lehigh Valley, Pa., and Westchester County, N.Y. Five Boro had been handled by Sid Paterson Advertising in New York, Lehigh Valley by J. W. Messner Inc. in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Westchester by Katz Dochtermann & Epstein in New York.
11/12/1997	To Streamline, G.M. Will Take Charges Up to $3 Billion	The General Motors Corporation announced today that it would take a charge against earnings of $2 billion to $3 billion as early as the fourth quarter to pay for job cuts, write-downs in the value of some factories and other changes intended to streamline the company in the long term. G.M. said the actions were prompted by its continuing study of the competitiveness of its major lines of business. It did not announce what the exact moves would be, even though they could cost the auto maker as much as it has earned in the last six months. The bulk of the job cuts are expected to come in Europe, where G.M. is struggling to compete with a newly resurgent Volkswagen.
11/5/1997	Auto Makers Report Weak October Sales	The Big Three American auto makers reported weak sales in October, giving the industry a slow start in the first month of the new model year. The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 4 percent last month compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, mostly because of weak sales of vans, small sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 2.1 percent last month, as a sharp drop in mini-van sales outweighed rising sales of large sport utility vehicles like the Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator. The Chrysler Corporation announced on Monday that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October.
11/5/1997	Auto Giants Build a Glut of Asian Plants, Just as Demand Falls	Shoppers have deserted car dealerships across Southeast Asia since the region's currency crisis began last summer, while investors who have lost fortunes in plummeting stock markets have flooded the used-car market with late-model luxury cars. The world's auto giants do not seem to care. Even though some industry experts insist they should pull back, General Motors and Ford Motor are busy building huge new assembly plants in Thailand and preparing to open up to five more factories in Southeast Asia and China. And Toyota and Honda are dealing with the crisis with temporary production cutbacks rather than changing their basic strategic plans.
11/4/1997	Talk Show Host Joins Cancer Fight	The General Motors Corporation is disclosing details of an agreement with Rosie O'Donnell for the talk show host to promote the company's ''Concept:Cure'' efforts to fight breast cancer.
11/4/1997	October Auto Sales Weak Except for Newest Designs	People shopping for a new car last month were ready to plunk down money for the hottest new or redesigned models, leaving auto makers with lackluster sales for all but the freshest designs. The Chrysler Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October, the first month of the new model year. But its newest sport utility vehicle, the brawny Dodge Durango, sold briskly, as did its new four-door version of the Dodge Ram pickup truck.
11/3/1997	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING ; G.M. sponsors a maker of documentaries and reaches PBS viewers 15 seconds at a time.	ON Tuesday, the latest documentary from Ken Burns will be shown on PBS, and the General Motors Corporation will get its 15 seconds of fame. Mr. Burns's new movie, ''Lewis and Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery,'' is expected to keep millions of viewers glued to their televisions, as did his earlier blockbuster documentaries ''Baseball'' and ''The Civil War.'' And, as in years past, G.M. is the sole corporate sponsor for the movie, part of an unusual, decade-old deal the company has with the film maker.
10/26/1997	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Prizm; A Pair of Sensible Shoes for the Road	AFTER I pulled up to the public library and locked the doors of the 1998 Toyota Corolla I was test-driving, a friend approached to ask how I liked the car. She has run up 120,000 miles on her 1990 Geo Prizm, the Corolla's twin, with her commute from the suburbs to downtown Detroit. I gave her a rundown on the new Corolla's virtues, but she was not ready to replace the well-used car that has served her nicely. ''I just got new brakes, so I'd like to get another 60,000 miles out of it,'' she concluded.
10/26/1997	The Brave New World of General Motors	SPIN the steering wheel of a Chevrolet Lumina and the car is slow to turn. Press hard on the gas, and there's a long pause before it accelerates. And, somehow, the Lumina manages to look large on the outside and feel small on the inside. None of this stops executives at the General Motors Corporation from feeling completely satisfied. The Lumina is making money, good money, thank you, in the treacherously competitive midsize car market. Because of its relatively low price and carefully focused marketing, the car is a favorite among price-conscious families and retirees.
10/24/1997	At Toyota, 10% Share Is Viewed As a Start	HIROSHI OKUDA is talking ''Global 10'' again, which means trouble for the world's auto manufacturers. Global 10 was the 1980's battle cry of the Toyota Motor Corporation, which aimed for a 10 percent share of the global market. But in the early 90's, as trade tensions with the United States flared and Toyota floundered, the slogan was quietly abandoned. Now, however, Japan's largest and most powerful auto company is out to gain market share again. And spearheading the drive is Mr. Okuda, the blunt-talking judo black belt who became president two years ago.
10/24/1997	G.M. Sales Hurt by Shortage of Rail Cars	The General Motors Corporation said this week that its United States sales would decline this month and perhaps the rest of the year because of a shortage of rail cars. Supplies of rail cars in the United States have dropped after the Union Pacific Corporation acquired the Southern Pacific Railroad and because of track construction in California and Texas.
10/23/1997	Advertisers are shuffling accounts that add up to more than $210 million in billings.	SEVERAL big national advertisers made changes on their accounts this week involving billings estimated at more than $210 million. One of the largest was the Vistakon unit of Johnson & Johnson, which named McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York to handle its worldwide Acuvue contact lenses account, with billings estimated at $40 million to $50 million. The account had been handled for the last decade by Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York, which like McCann is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
10/21/1997	Hughes Won't Be Hurt by Chairman's Exit, G.M. Says	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had no intention of selling the Hughes Electronics Corporation and that the subsidiary would not be hurt by the departure of its chairman and chief executive, C. Michael Armstrong, to head the AT&T Corporation. As expected, Hughes's vice chairman, Michael T. Smith, was named the new chairman and chief executive of the aerospace and communications company. He vowed to improve the company's performance, particularly in its high-profile DirecTV satellite television service, which has been hurt by slowing growth and successful onslaughts by competitors.
10/21/1997	G.M. Division Shifting Account	The Pontiac-GMC division of the General Motors Corporation is shifting the GMC trucks account, with billings estimated at $70 million, between agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, according to executives close to the agencies involved. G.M. is dismissing the Troy, Mich., office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising and hiring Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York.
10/19/1997	AT&T Is Expected to Pick Chief From Hughes	The AT&T Corporation plans to wrap up its three-month search for a chairman and chief executive on Monday by selecting C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman and chief executive of the Hughes Electronics Corporation, an executive close to the one of the companies said yesterday. The executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Michael T. Smith, the vice chairman of Hughes, is expected to replace Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Smith is a brother of John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Hughes's parent, the General Motors Corporation.
10/17/1997	Future Showrooms: Museum, Mall or Resort?	WHILE some analysts suggest that the Internet spells doom for dealerships, auto makers are hedging their bets by exploring new ways to lure shoppers into showrooms. In New York, the General Motors Corpporation opened the doors this week to G.M. on Fifth, a redesigned showroom inside the General Motors Building at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue. Intended to introduce consumers to the 60-plus car and truck models the company offers, the showroom includes cars in museum-like dioramas keyed to marketing themes, along with interactive capabilities that put browsers in the driver's seat in exotic locales. A central point of the showroom is communicating to consumers the brand identity that G.M. is trying to establish for each of its vehicles.
10/16/1997	Court Weighs Whether One State Must Obey Another's Courts	The Supreme Court has spent considerable energy recently examining the relationship between the states and the Federal Government. Today, the Justices shifted their focus to a much less explored side of federalism: the relationship among the states themselves. The question in a case argued today was whether the courts of one state must always honor the judgments of another state's courts, even when those judgments embody policies that conflict with the first state's own laws or sense of fairness. The answer depends on the High Court's interpretation of the clause of the Constitution that obliges the courts of one state to give ''full faith and credit'' to the ''records, acts and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other state.''
10/16/1997	Big, Bigger, Biggest: Rolling Reports From Across the Country; Git Along, Not-So-Little Sport-Ute	ACROSS the nation, the Suburban is enjoying some of the hottest sales years in its history, and six decades after its creation, this nearly 18 1/2-foot behemoth has recently inspired a bunch of mammoth knockoffs, including the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator. But if its popularity is a new phenomenon in much of the country, there is at least one place where the Suburban has long been considered king: Texas.
10/15/1997	G.M. Stock Slides Despite Solid Earnings	The General Motors Corporation reported today that third-quarter earnings were better than expected, but its stock fell as analysts focused on the deterioration in profitability at its auto parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems, and concluded that the division was less likely to be partly spun off anytime soon. Profits at Delphi were crimped as its customers -- including its biggest customer, General Motors -- demanded lower prices for auto parts. Delphi also faced several costly changes in parts for redesigned cars and trucks this quarter, G.M. said. ''The pressure that they're under is from their customers,'' said J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer.
10/11/1997	G.M.'s Check Is in the Mail, No Kidding	It usually works the other way, but Detroit has finally started sending customers checks for buying new cars. Two divisions of the General Motors Corporation said this week that they were dropping prices on some 1998 cars and were mailing checks refunding the difference to anyone who had bought one.
10/6/1997	Updates/Media and Technology; Software to Track Business Prospects By Web Visits	One of the biggest fetters on the growth of advertising on the World Wide Web has been advertisers' uncertainty about how many people are actually seeing the banners and other visual gadgets they are spending to promote. Many Internet service providers and big organizations that provide access to cyberspace make copies of popular Web pages, like Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com), for instance, and serve them up to their users instead of having them clog the Internet with repeated requests for the same material.
10/5/1997	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Opel Omega Sport and Cadillac Catera; Fraternal Twins an Ocean Apart	EVER salivate over the delicious variety of unfamiliar cars whizzing by on European highways and wish you could try them out back home? Renault may never send a Twingo your way; Lancia keeps the Dedra at home, and Ford has no plans to import its cute little Ka. But General Motors heard your prayers, rebadging the German-built Opel Omega as the Cadillac Catera -- the one that zigs. Only it's not quite the same car. And while both are appealing vehicles, the changes that G.M. made say a lot about the differences between European and American tastes in automobiles. Or, more accurately, what G.M. thinks is needed to sell a fine European sedan as a Cadillac.
10/5/1997	That's Entertainment	WHAT -- The GMC Suburban, in a limited edition of 100, sold by Neiman Marcus for $72,975. That's more than twice the price for the basic nine-passenger vehicle, a gas-guzzling land yacht popular with everyone from soccer moms to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is driven around in one instead of a limousine. CAR AS ENTERTAINMENT CENTER -- This Suburban features built-in videocassette player and five airplane-style monitors set into seat backs or squeezed into the console between the front seats. None of the screens are visible to the driver, who must still devote full attention to the road. Other built-ins include a CD player that can hold 10 disks, an eight-speaker sound system, a cellular telephone and cupholders that can cool a can of soda or heat coffee. THEY WANT IT THEIR WAY -- The new model allows General Motors -- and Sony, which supplies the gadgets -- to cash in on a highly profitable trend: consumers are demanding that expensive sport utility vehicles have options not available from regular dealers. Automotive shops have been charging a premium to spiff up fresh-from-the-factory Suburbans with extra electronic equipment. WAVE OF THE FUTURE -- Mike Mazer, a Sony vice president, boasts that this Suburban will change ''Are we there yet?'' to ''Do we have to get out?'' The real question is whether passengers will bother to look out the windows. ''One child can watch the built-in Playstation on one monitor,'' he said. ''The other children can be watching a video on the other monitors. Another child can be playing the separate cassette player. And you can always turn on the light and read a book.'' JAMES BARRON
10/5/1997	A Cadillac With Global Ambitions	AFTER dropping the rear-drive Fleetwood and introducing a new entry-level model, the Catera, last year, Cadillac has moved to shore up its new lineup, redesigning the Seville sedan. The 1998 Seville, which goes on sale by early December, shifts from its exclusive Cadillac platform to the more rigid chassis used for the Buick Riviera and the Oldsmobile Aurora. The stiffer structure is designed for improved protection in a crash, more responsive handling and a better ride.
10/4/1997	Auto Sales Weaken as Buyers Await Deals	Call it the car buyer's revenge. Auto sales slowed in September, and as a result auto makers are expected to announce a new round of rebates and discounted lease deals as they vigorously try to woo more buyers into showrooms.
10/3/1997	Car Makers Voice Complaints About Limiting Gas Emissions	President Clinton met this evening with the chief executives of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler to promote his trade policies, but received instead an earful of complaints about the Administration's interest in limiting emissions of gases that may contribute to global warming. The White House held the meeting the day after threatening South Korea with trade sanctions if it did not remove auto import limits. But the auto executives were more worried about the Administration's stance on global warming for a United Nations conference in December, and took the opportunity this evening to tell the President just what they thought.
9/27/1997	Skittish About Growth in Sleepy Hollow	General Motors has proposed transforming the hulking automobile factory that was the clanging heart of North Tarrytown into a luxurious development that could be the humming new center of Sleepy Hollow. Last week the auto company unveiled an ambitious plan to build a mini-village on the site of its closed factory, one of the largest parcels of land slated for development along the Hudson. But the village that changed its name last year as part of an effort to change its blue-collar image is saying the automaker's glittery plan may be too ambitious.
9/26/1997	Market Place; Signs of Life, and Wall St. Applause, for the Giant of Detroit	The General Motors Corporation, a sleeping giant on Wall Street, has reawakened. In the last two months, G.M.'s shares have risen about 20 percent after treading water over most of the last three years. Some analysts predict that G.M. stock will continue its climb.
9/21/1997	G.M. Geography: Farewell, Geo	GOODBYE, Geo. Hello, Chevy. As the 1998 car models arrive in showrooms this fall, a familiar name is missing. The General Motors Corporation is dropping the Geo nameplate from its Metro and Prizm cars and Tracker sport utility. Those vehicles will now wear the bow-tie insignia of Chevrolet. The Geo name and its emblem of a globe have been around since 1989, when G.M. used them to designate cars and trucks made for the corporation by other companies or that were built in joint ventures with foreign auto makers. The tiny Geo/Chevrolet Metro, for instance, is a twin of the Suzuki Swift and is manufactured in Ingersoll, Ontario, as is the Tracker and its twin, the Suzuki Sidekick. The Prizm is essentially a Toyota Corolla; both are built at a joint-venture plant in Fremont, Calif.
9/12/1997	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Collecting; 100 Candles for Olds And Cars That Shine On	AS its 1998 models arrive in dealer showrooms, Oldsmobile begins its second hundred years. For those who love vintage autos, Olds is significant for more than being the oldest surviving American nameplate, and the first to celebrate its centennial. The General Motors division has built some merry and memorable cars, a handful of which are highly desirable today. Older Oldses are not particularly expensive, at least not like Ferraris and Duesenbergs, and they have an enthusiastic following. About two thousand Oldsmobiles, of nearly every vintage, showed up last month to form a caravan that encircled the brand's hometown of Lansing, Mich., to mark Olds's 100th birthday.
9/11/1997	SPORTS BUSINESS ; G.M. Links Marketing to a Cause	When Mary Cobbs, who is receiving chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer, learned that General Motors was a Women's National Basketball Association sponsor, she told her daughter, the Houston Comets star Cynthia Cooper, ''Did you know they have a breast cancer awareness program?'' Yes, Cooper said. ''Then, girl, you go do everything you can for them,'' Cobbs said.
9/4/1997	Sales Results Show Americans Buying Trucks and More Trucks	The new Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle has not yet reached showrooms, but most dealerships are sold out for the rest of this year. The Lincoln Navigator, a huge luxury truck, is also in short supply. And August sales results released today show that Americans continue to buy more and more trucks, with the latest, expensive truck models among the most popular. The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales rose a stronger-than-expected 7.6 percent last month compared with the period a year earlier. Trucks did well, with sales up 7.2 percent, propelled by strong mini-van sales, but car sales were also strong, rising 7.8 percent.
8/30/1997	Buick Bringing Its Rivals to the Showroom Floor	It sounds like a cruel challenge: Why not put Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords in Buick dealerships and see whether dealers can persuade people to buy the Buicks anyway? Even executives at Buick's parent company, the General Motors Corporation, thought the idea was a joke at first. After all, Camrys and Accords are synonymous with high quality and reliability to the generation of buyers who normally would not be caught dead in a Buick showroom. To baby boomers, Buicks are synonymous with mushy steering, velour-covered bench seats and room for six.
8/15/1997	A Boost From Cadillac For Radio Data System	American auto makers are finally embracing the radio data system, an FM-based technology that originated in Europe, giving a big lift to the fledgling broadcast-information service. The radio data system, known as R.D.S., allows FM stations to broadcast a silent stream of data along with audio signals, providing consumers a variety of safety, entertainment and convenience features.
8/14/1997	For 1998, New-Car Prices Barely Budge	Nearly every autumn, auto makers could be counted on to roll out next year's models, and nearly every autumn they raised prices. Not this year.
8/10/1997	At Age 100, Bearing A Promising Offspring	WHEN we were young, my siblings and I played a game in which one of us secretly selected an object in the room, and the others would try to guess what it was. The person keeping the secret would suggest how close we were to the article by telling us we were getting warmer -- that is, closer -- or colder, which was farther away. That game came to mind as I test-drove the 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue along with its principal target, the Toyota Camry. The Intrigue is the latest of several new midsize cars from the General Motors Corporation, and shares its basic front-wheel-drive architecture with the Buick Regal, Buick Century and Pontiac Grand Prix.
8/10/1997	Olds Survives to Start Its Second Hundred Years	AFTER surviving its most recent near-death experience, Oldsmobile is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year, the first American auto company to reach that milestone. Your great-grandfather's Oldsmobile was born on Aug. 21, 1897, when Ransom E. Olds and a group of investors formed the Olds Motor Vehicle Company in Lansing, Mich. Oldsmobile estimates that 2,500 vehicle makers have come and gone since 1897. ''Obviously only a handful have made it,'' said Darwin E. Clark, the general manager of Oldsmobile, now a General Motors division. ''Over its 100-year history, Oldsmobile almost closed its doors four times. It shows a lot of resiliency, bringing cars to market that customers want to buy.''
8/2/1997	Auto Makers In Price War To Spur Sales	Sales results released by auto makers today showed an industry in an old-fashioned price war, with companies offering some of their broadest discounts ever in efforts to increase their market shares. For the 11 auto makers reporting results today, sales rose a combined 5.6 percent last month over July 1996. The General Motors Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Company all reported sales gains in July, while the Chrysler Corporation said its sales dropped 9 percent from record levels in July 1996. G.M. said its stronger sales were propelled by rebates it began offering in mid-July, while Honda and Toyota have been passing on savings from the weak yen.
7/31/1997	Suspense Ads Focus On New Oldsmobile	Those who think going to the movies means they will not have to sit through advertising for anything but popcorn may be in for a surprise this summer. Two ads for the General Motors' Oldsmobile Intrigue sedan have been playing in 141 movie theaters nationwide this month as part of a contest that urges viewers to guess who makes the car.
7/31/1997	G.M.'s Deals For Olympics Said to Cost $900 Million	The General Motors Corporation's decision to commit an estimated $900 million to sponsor the Olympics through 2008 is a wager that the next six Winter and Summer Games will continue to galvanize the interest of fans, viewers and potential car buyers as they have in recent years. ''Big events only grow in value over time,'' Philip Guarascio, vice president and general manager for marketing and advertising at G.M.'s North American operations, said yesterday in announcing the unprecedented deals with NBC and the United States Olympic Committee.
7/28/1997	G.M. Is Likely To Make Huge Olympic Pacts	Reinforcing the powerful marketing cachet of the Olympics, the General Motors Corporation is expected to announce a sponsorship deal this week worth several hundred million dollars with NBC and the United States Olympic Committee that would run into the next decade. The three parties are still negotiating the full value of the sponsorships in terms of commercial television time, fees to the Olympic Committee, promotional spending and products contributed by G.M., according to persons familiar with the deal.
7/26/1997	GM and Union Reach Accord To Settle a Strike at Parts Plant	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers reached a tentative contract agreement tonight to end a strike at a transmission factory that had forced the company to idle six other plants in three days. If the nearly 2,500 members of U.A.W. Local 909 ratify the pact on Sunday morning, they are likely to return to work next week.
7/24/1997	Strike Closes Parts Factory In Job Dispute	This has been the year of strikes at the General Motors Corporation, a series of contests pitting a union determined to keep the company from downsizing against a bloated auto maker struggling to get in shape as more and more customers buy from G.M.'s more efficient competitors. The latest walkout came just before midnight on Tuesday here, where 2,510 workers build parts used on nearly all of the company's American-made cars and trucks. If the strike lasts more than a few days, it could shut down most of the company, resulting in tens of thousands of layoffs nationwide as other G.M. factories run out of the transmissions, wheels and other parts built here.
7/23/1997	Brazilian Peasants Demand Farmland	In a unanimous decision, the State Supreme Court ruled yesterday that business equipment and machinery cannot be taxed by cities and towns. The ruling stemmed from a long battle between the City of Linden and General Motors Corporation, which sued the city for what it considered high tax assessments from 1983 to 1985 on its automobile plant. The state's highest court upheld an appeals court decision that the 1992 Business Retention Act, which says that equipment necessary to operate a business is exempt from local property taxes, does not violate the State Constitution.
7/22/1997	Court Curbs Tax on Business	DURING the next few years, the General Motors Corporation will execute a huge movement of people and resources into its new corporate home in the downtown Renaissance Center. Real estate executives here expect a game of musical chairs to ensue, as transplanted G.M. employees displace all of the 8,000 office workers who now occupy the 2.2 million-square-foot, five-tower complex. Already, First of Michigan Corporation, a securities brokerage that has been a Renaissance Center tenant since 1977, is seeking new quarters. It will remain in the city, but others may move elsewhere.
7/20/1997	In Detroit, G.M. Begins a Game of Musical Chairs	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company announced better-than-expected second-quarter earnings today, profiting from lower costs and America's seemingly boundless appetite for huge sport utility vehicles and big pickups. Financial analysts said that the mammoth Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle had emerged as the industry's most profitable model. Jack V. Kirnan at Salomon Brothers estimated that Ford earned $14,000 in pretax profits on each $30,000 Expedition, excluding vehicle design and engineering costs, amounting to $1.05 billion in the second quarter.
7/6/1997	At 30, Still a Diversion for Consenting Adults	THE car is spectacular, I'll give it that. It is a 30th-anniversary Camaro SS, Arctic white with ''hugger orange'' stripes, a houndstooth interior, huge tires and a snarling V8 under the hood. It is a car for superlatives. But at the moment it was totally inadequate. ''Let's try the stroller this way,'' I said to Mischa, rearranging things under the gaping hatch for, perhaps, the fifth time. And it fit, sort of.
7/3/1997	G.M. June Sales Off 13.3% Amid Industrywide Decline	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 13.3 percent last month, leaving the auto industry as a whole on track to end the second quarter with a whimper, following a stellar first quarter. The weak G.M. sales reflect lackluster demand for new cars and trucks industrywide, Wall Street analysts said. Sales of the company's pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles fell 7.7 percent, while car sales plummeted 16.7 percent in June, compared with a year earlier.
7/1/1997	G.M. Says Strikes Cost $490 Million	The General Motors Corporation said today that strikes at its assembly plants in Pontiac, Mich., and Oklahoma City had hurt its earnings by $490 million, or 67 cents a share, so far this year. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, G.M. said the strikes had cost the company 96,000 units of production through the second quarter.
6/29/1997	Out of the Rocker, Ready to Roll	MY grandmother was a loyal Buick owner. A mechanical draftsman, she appreciated the refined engineering and solid structure that had long been Buick attributes. A widow who often traveled to visit her grandchildren, she felt secure and comfortable in the cavernous interiors. I recall Christmas Days when I helped her unload gifts and tins of homemade goodies from the immense trunk of her 60's-era Electra. And for years before she died last year, she drove a LeSabre from the early 80's; though it was full-sized, she considered it small compared with Buicks she had previously owned. On the other side of the generation gap, I saw myself driving Hondas or Toyotas or BMW's, but not Buicks. To many of us with Rolling Stones sensitivities, they seemed like Mantovani cars, catering to people like my grandmother who wanted roomy cabins; wide, flat seats; floaty, boulevard rides, and mushy handling. I kept wondering when Buick would build a car for the Woodstock generation. After all, the ranks of Buick customers were thinning.
6/28/1997	$10.9 MILLION INVESTMENT AT TRUCK PLANT IS PLANNED	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would invest $10.9 million in equipment at its truck plant in Flint, Mich., and move 1,000 managers to a new metal-fabricating division headquarters in the city by the year 2000. The $10.9 million will be used for new tooling and other equipment at the factory and is a result of G.M.'s plan to start producing the 3500 HD commercial pickup truck at Flint this fall, about three years ahead of the original plan. The 1,000 managers will move to Flint in 1999 or 2000 as the metals-fabricating unit consolidates its headquarters from two sites in Troy, Mich. The decisions are the latest in a series of G.M. plant and office moves in the Flint area
6/24/1997	G.M. Unit to Pay $550 Million for Insurer	The General Motors Corporation's financing unit said today that it had agreed to buy the Integon Corporation for $550 million in cash to increase its presence in the auto insurance market. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation said it would offer $26 a share for Integon, or a 62.5 percent premium over today's closing price for shares of the automobile insurance company, which is based in Winston-Salem.
6/23/1997	G.M. and Sony join forces to market cars to moviegoers at a Michigan theater complex.	THE next wave in marketing may be coming soon to a theater near you. The nation's largest advertiser, the General Motors Corporation, has teamed up with Sony in a novel effort to gently advertise cars to moviegoers in Southfield, a suburb of Detroit. It has begun the alliance -- which goes far beyond simply running ads during the movie previews -- at a new 6,000-seat, 20-screen theater here called the Star Southfield Entertainment Center, owned by the Sony Retail Entertainment division.
6/22/1997	A 2-Door for Buyers At the Entry Level	ABOUT a year ago, the clerk at a service station was admiring the handsome European sedan I was driving, the brand of which I no longer recall. ''But, I like coupes,'' said the middle-aged woman, ''I just can't bring myself to buy a four-door. They're for old people.''
6/20/1997	General Bearing and G.M.	The General Bearing Corporation said yesterday that it had reached a $54 million agreement with the General Motors Corporation to supply wheel and axle bearings to the No. 1 auto maker over the next three years.
6/17/1997	Start Expanding That Garage For Detroit's Next Generation	Big is getting bigger on the American road. American car makers, inspired by the recent popularity of big cars and trucks, are planning even larger models with equally gigantic sticker prices. Take the behemoth being tested by the Ford Motor Company, which, at 19 feet, would dethrone the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban by a foot as the longest mass-produced family vehicle ever built.
6/17/1997	What's Good for General Motors	With Congress still dawdling over legislation to clean up campaign financing, leadership on changing Washington's corrupt money game is emerging from a surprising direction. In recent weeks, three major American corporations -- General Motors, Monsanto and AlliedSignal Inc. -- have decided, independently of one another, to renounce a corrupt form of campaign financing, the so-called ''soft money'' contributions to political parties that allow the parties to evade legal limits on contributions to individual candidates. Each company cites the uproar over the polluting role of such contributions, making it plain they were moved to retreat from soft money at least partly because of public disgust over the present fund-raising system. Beyond that, many top executives, a Business Week survey found, are exasperated at the repeated demands for contributions from politicians who can affect their bottom line.
6/15/1997	The Return of Detroit's 'Low Priced Three'	DID somebody say ''value''? With auto makers from Hyundai to Mercedes repeating that word like a mantra, its definition has grown fuzzy. But for many new-car shoppers of limited means, a good value means the biggest car for the money. The three brands represented on this page, Chevrolet, Ford and Plymouth, were conceived as purveyors of high-value transportation, and they filled that role neatly for decades. Well into the 1960's they were the ''Low Priced Three,'' the first rung up the automotive ladder for working people who wanted a roomy, reliable, economical car, with perhaps a little style thrown in. Over time, the three broadened their offerings and blurred that image, which brand-driven marketers are now trying to reclaim.
6/9/1997	G.M. and U.A.W. Preparing for Strike At Three Factories	After months of skirmishes, the United Automobile Workers union and General Motors are bracing for another showdown over the company's effort to continue shrinking its work force through attrition. In the last several days, the U.A.W. has taken legal steps to prepare for strikes later this week at three auto parts factories, said Reg McGhee, a union spokesman. The factories, which employ 4,300 workers, are in Milwaukee and two Michigan cities, Saginaw and Grand Rapids.
6/5/1997	Investors Get a G.M. Windfall, And G.M. Does All Right, Too	The General Motors Corporation has a deal for investors who own the more than $363 million in two issues of its preferred stock. It wants to pay them a higher rate of interest. G.M.'s proposal, announced this week, could cost the auto maker an additional $2.7 million a year in payments to investors.
6/4/1997	G.M. Posts Decline in Sales; Mixed Results by Japanese	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.5 percent last month compared with May 1996, the second big American auto maker to post a sales decline for the month. Sales were mixed for large Japanese auto makers, which have been enjoying the benefits of a strong dollar. Toyota said today that its sales fell 6 percent compared with the period a year ago, while Honda reported that its sales rose 4.8 percent. Nissan said its sales rose 7.8 percent and Mazda said its sales fell 15.1 percent, and some other auto makers posted mixed May results today. For the 17 auto makers who have reported May results so far, sales are down 7.2 percent, with car sales down 11.7 percent and sales of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks up 0.2 percent.
6/3/1997	Chrysler Says May Sales Fell As Strike Crimped Output	The Chrysler Corporation became the first in the auto industry to fulfill Wall Street's prophesy that May sales results by the Big Three American auto makers would be weak, compared with the strong monthly sales levels of a year ago. Chrysler said today that its May sales of cars and trucks fell to 204,654, down 16.6 percent from May 1996, when the company's sales were the highest ever. Sales of its Jeeps, pickup trucks and mini-vans fell 15.5 percent, crimped partly by a monthlong strike at a Detroit engine factory in April and May. Chrysler's car sales dropped 18.4 percent.
5/30/1997	Indy Pace Car: Rarely Does It Corner Market	The Official Pace Car is a fixture of the Indianapolis 500. The tradition began at the first Indy 500 in 1911, when the founder of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Carl G. Fisher, used his own Stoddard-Dayton Model 11-A touring car to lead the racers around the track before the green flag fell. The list of pace cars for the years that followed reads like a biography of well-known American automobiles, including a Packard V12 (1919), an ''A'' model Duesenberg (1923), a Ford Thunderbird (1961) and even a Chevrolet Beretta (1990).
5/26/1997	G.M. Workers in Oklahoma Agree to End a 7-Week Strike	Striking auto workers at a General Motors plant in Oklahoma City agreed today to end their seven-week walkout, although a final vote on the tentative accord was delayed for a few more days. Details of the contract were not released. The decision to end the strike was approved by roughly 70 percent of the 1,450 workers who attended a union meeting today, said Steve Featherston, president of the United Auto Workers local at the plant.
5/25/1997	It's a World Record: 249 Miles Without an Extension Cord	A Geo Metro converted by a Massachusetts company to run on electricity set a world record by traveling 249 miles without recharging in a five-day race and rally for electric cars that ended on Friday in Portland, Me. The car used a type of battery that the General Motors Corporation will use in its EV-1 electric car later this year, which will more than double the car's range compared with the lead-acid batteries it uses now.
5/17/1997	CORPORATE GIFTS HELP GAIN ACCESS TO U.S. GOVERNORS	In the past several years, a select group of the nation's biggest corporations have given millions of dollars to the National Governors' Association and an affiliated research arm. In return for their tax-deductible contributions, the corporations' lobbyists have gained unusual access to the governors' policy-making apparatus. They take part in the governors' plenary meetings, attend receptions with governors, get briefings from the group's leaders and staff, are offered private work spaces and meeting areas at its annual gatherings and attend other events to help them ''become better acquainted with governors' staffs and to share common interests,'' an association fact sheet says.
5/17/1997	GENERAL MOTORS LOSES SUIT OVER CREDIT CARD	A New York jury awarded $24 million to a New York promotional marketing agency Thursday in a breach of contract lawsuit against the General Motors Corporation over the origins of the G.M. Mastercard. The agency, Communications Diversified, contended that in the early 1980's it talked with Chevrolet officials about creating a credit card that would offer rebates on cars and trucks. G.M. researched and rejected the idea, During the 1990's, G.M. began the G.M. Mastercard program. Officials of Communications Diversified said G.M. had violated an agreement by offering a credit card without involving them. The jury agreed.
5/11/1997	G.M. Shapes Up Around the Middle	FOUR midsize General Motors cars appeared on the cover of a 1983 issue of Fortune magazine. Parked side by side on a lawn, they wore the same hue of burgundy paint and they struck identical profiles. Few readers could tell the Chevrolet Celebrity from the Buick Century or the Oldsmobile Ciera from the Pontiac 6000. That cover photograph is burned into my memory, and it had a profound effect, too, on executives, engineers and designers at G.M. It was hard to miss the point: that the world's largest auto maker was trying to fool the public by putting different nameplates and varying prices on what were essentially the same cars. Of course, other auto makers played that game, too -- but G.M.'s dizzying jumble of similar offerings made it an easy target for critics.
5/8/1997	The 800-pound gorilla among advertisers, the auto industry, gained a little more weight in 1996.	AUTO makers, traditionally the nation's largest advertisers, nailed down the industry's premier position even more securely last year by raising their ad spending 9.4 percent over 1995. Indeed, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU N.V. that tracks advertising expenditures, the auto industry as a whole spent $11.6 billion on advertising last year, or more than 17 percent of the $66.7 billion that the nation's advertisers spent. And the spending figures for auto companies do not include advertising paid for by local auto dealers.
5/8/1997	FIRST MONTH BRINGS 100 SATURN SALES IN JAPAN, G.M. SAYS	The General Motors Corporation's Saturn division sold about 100 cars in its first month of sales in Japan, a spokesman said yesterday. Saturn had firm orders for about 100 vehicles, with 60 of those officially registered as sales. It can be two weeks or longer after a buyer orders a car until it is registered. The introduction of the Saturn on April 5 came days after Japan raised its consumption tax to 5 percent from 3 percent. Consumers rushed to buy cars in March before the increase, setting the industry up for a decline in April. Saturn did not announce a monthly sales target when it opened for business last month.
5/8/1997	As Chrysler Strike Ends, Other Walkouts Loom in Auto Industry	The United Automobile Workers publicly agreed today to end its biggest strike against the Chrysler Corporation in 30 years, but further strikes seemed likely soon in the auto industry, notably against the General Motors Corporation. Nearly 1,900 engine factory workers went on strike here on April 10, forcing Chrysler to shut down five assembly plants that needed the engines for pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees. The engine workers were alarmed by Chrysler's plans to buy certain drive-shaft parts from the Dana Corporation, based in Toledo, Ohio, instead of continuing to produce them here.
5/7/1997	G.M. Is Trying to Make a Go Of Its Electric Car	It has been five months since General Motors introduced the country's first mass-produced electric vehicle in Southern California and Arizona, and demand is just about what the company said it would be: lackluster at best. The world's biggest auto maker has found just 176 takers for its New Age $34,000 two-seater, known as the EV1. Hoping to stir up consumer interest, it cut monthly lease payments by $100, or 25 percent, last Friday for the zippy little coupe, to a range of $399 to $549. But for that, a car shopper could get a sporty Honda Prelude.
5/6/1997	Ford Sales Fell 4.3% in April as Big 3 Lost Share to Foreign Makers	The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 4.3 percent last month, as the Big Three American auto makers lost ground to Japanese auto makers that benefited from favorable exchange rates. The Big Three sold 73.3 percent of the cars and trucks purchased in the United States in April, down 2.1 percentage points from April 1996. Their loss was mostly Japanese auto makers' gain: they picked up 1.2 percentage points of market share, while German auto makers gained another seven-tenths of a percentage point.
5/3/1997	Seeking to Jump-Start Leasing, G.M. Cuts Prices on Electric Car	In an effort to bolster flagging lease rates of the EV1, a limited-range electric car introduced in Southern California and Arizona last December, the General Motors Corporation yesterday lowered the effective cost 25 percent and agreed to partly finance quick construction of 50 public charging stations. ''We face a chicken-or-egg dilemma,'' J. Joseph Kennedy, a sales vice president for Saturn, the G.M. unit that is marketing the EV1, told owners in a letter they received Thursday. ''To expand our infrastructure quickly, we have to get more cars on the road, faster, but to do that, we have to have more infrastructure in place.''
5/2/1997	Sales for G.M. And Chrysler Fell in April	The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation said today that their car and truck sales cooled off last month, even as Japanese auto makers, benefiting from favorable exchange rates, reported stronger sales. G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, said that its sales in the United States dropped 5.2 percent last month from the corresponding period a year earlier, while Chrysler said its sales fell 11.5 percent. By contrast, the eight Japanese auto makers reporting April sales today saw their sales rise a combined 2.0 percent.
5/2/1997	General Motors gambles on a do-or-die strategy to reinvigorate the Oldsmobile marque.	EVERYONE agrees it is a tough assignment. The Leo Burnett Company is charged with wooing Honda and Toyota buyers to Oldsmobile, best known for building stodgy sedans driven by grandparents.
4/24/1997	Strikes Against Automakers Threaten Car-Sales Season	Strikes at automobile factories are crimping the output of popular cars and trucks just as the spring selling season is getting under way at dealerships across the country. About 32,000 members of the United Automobile Workers union are off the job as a result of three strikes, the first starting on April 4. The most recent one began on Tuesday night, when just before midnight about 5,900 workers in Pontiac, Mich., struck the General Motors Corporation.
4/15/1997	G.M. Quarterly Profit Soars, Eclipsing All Forecasts	Exceeding even the most optimistic predictions of Wall Street analysts, the General Motors Corporation said today that its earnings more than doubled in the first quarter as the troubled North American division reported its strongest profit in a decade. The auto company and securities analysts attributed the gain in profitability to G.M.'s introduction of new models in North America that are less expensive to manufacture, together with broad savings in parts purchases and more efficient factories. Profit rose despite a decline in the exchange value of the yen, which made it easier for Japanese auto makers to offer low prices and forced G.M. to counter with deep discounts on many models.
4/6/1997	Detroit Steps Up With Class	WHEN a jaded country-club parking valet gives the thumbs up to your car and you are driving a Buick, you know that Detroit has done something right at last. ''Nice car,'' the guy remarked as my wife and I alighted from the 1997 Park Avenue Ultra and adjusted our finery for my niece's wedding reception at the Tavistock Country Club in Haddonfield, N.J.
4/3/1997	G.M. Says March Sales Rose On Strength of New Models	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales increased for the first time in 10 months, rising 4.1 percent in March from a year ago. The gain represents the first sign that G.M.'s efforts to refresh a tired lineup of cars and trucks by adding 15 redesigned models may be luring buyers to showrooms. But analysts cautioned that sales during March 1996 were hobbled by a 17-day strike, making it far easier for G.M. to surpass last year's weak performance.
4/1/1997	Saturn Pulls Disputed Ad	The Saturn division of the General Motors Corporation has withdrawn advertisements featuring a woman described as a hearing-impaired Saturn owner after allegations appeared in publications for the deaf that her hearing is normal. The print and television ads, created by Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco, have featured Holly Daniel, a woman from Baton Rouge, La., as part of a series that centers on satisfied Saturn owners. Ms. Daniel is described as so enthusiastic about her Saturn that she created her own sign-language symbol for it. The dispute comes at a time when disabled consumers have assumed increased prominence in campaigns.
3/30/1997	A Car for the People Who Aren't Car People	It is a name that conjures sensuous images of waves rolling onto a California beach, of muscular surfers emerging from the ocean and of tanned bodies soaking up sun. None of which has anything to do with the 1997 Malibu, Chevrolet's new midsize sedan. The name is important, though, because it evokes Chevrolet's glory days, a period in the 60's and 70's when General Motors' low-priced division dominated every segment in which it offered a car. And Chevy was particularly strong in midsized cars, where Malibu was the name given to top-of-the-line Chevelles, including practical sedans and wagons, stylish hardtops and convertibles and high-performance muscle cars.
3/29/1997	U.A.W. WORKERS AT INDIANA G.M. PLANT RATIFY PACT	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that the United Automobile Workers had ratified the agreement that ends a 13-day strike at the company's pickup truck plant in Fort Wayne, Ind. Strikers will return to work on Tuesday. Under the agreement, G.M. will hire 276 workers, the union said. The new workers will be placed ''in well-defined, specific positions that will allow the Fort Wayne plant and G.M. to remain competitive,'' a G.M. spokesman, Tom Beaman, said. The new workers, though full time, will be used mainly to fill in for people who are on vacation, in training or otherwise temporarily absent, Mr. Beaman said.
3/29/1997	Snapple Is Just the Latest Case Of Mismatched Reach and Grasp	The Quaker Oats Company's $1.4 billion debacle with Snapple only proves that the well-trod merger road has been paved with unrealized synergies and executive hubris, experts in mergers and acquisitions say. The oatmeal king is in good company when it comes to hailing an acquisition as a quick and brilliant way to increase earnings, only to see it collapse amid red ink and clashing corporate cultures. It has happened to corporate giants and high-technology start-ups alike, including I.B.M., Xerox, General Motors, Sony, General Electric and Novell.
3/28/1997	Oldsmobile Adds Agencies to Roster	The Oldsmobile division of the General Motors Corporation in Lansing, Mich., has added two agencies to its roster to handle new assignments. Billings were not disclosed.
3/27/1997	Gore in China: Still No Break in the Political Wall	After two days of talks with China's Communist Party leaders, Vice President Al Gore said tonight that despite domestic political pressures that are vexing Chinese-American relations, the Clinton Administration is determined to ''strengthen and broaden'' its bonds with the People's Republic. Speaking at a news conference here, he said planning would now go forward for President Jiang Zemin to visit Washington this fall and asserted that ''a strong consensus in the center of the American political system'' supports continued dialogue and engagement with China.
3/25/1997	GORE WITNESSES BOEING-CHINA DEAL	In a move to underscore Washington's enthusiasm for expanding trade with China, Vice President Al Gore appeared today at the signing of two business deals worth almost $2 billion, including a purchase by the Chinese of five Boeing 777 jetliners for $685 million. The Boeing agreement seemed jeopardized last week by the charges of illegal campaign finances now dominating Washington, as Mr. Gore's aides worried about associating the Vice President with anything that smacked of deal-making with the Chinese during his four-day visit here.
3/23/1997	Auto Stocks: Beneath the Metallic Glow	RESENTED with the prospect of buying something for nearly nothing, investors might pull out their wallets or they might fret that their pockets are about to be picked. When it comes to investing in the auto makers, fretting seems to carry the day. For more than a decade, various Wall Street analysts have periodically suggested that investors could get something for nothing by buying the Big Three auto makers' low-flying stocks. By their argument, the non-automotive assets alone are worth almost as much as all the outstanding stock at these companies, so investors essentially get the automotive operations free. Auto executives frustrated by the low values placed on their stocks have been quietly encouraging this analysis lately. .
3/13/1997	G.M. Data Solve Mystery On Auto Parts	After decades of resistance, the General Motors Corporation provided separate financial information today on its sprawling auto parts operations, a corporate empire bigger than the Boeing Company or the Coca-Cola Company. The data bore out what analysts had long suspected: that profits from the auto parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems, were propping up otherwise weak results in the car-building business. Last year, Delphi earned $526 million on sales of $26 billion, for a profit margin of 2 percent, G.M. said. By contrast, G.M.'s North American Operations division earned $730 million on sales of $93.38 billion, for a profit margin of just eight-tenths of 1 percent.
3/11/1997	G.M. Announces Two Steps to Streamline Its Operations	The General Motors Corporation announced two steps today to streamline its sprawling operations, putting all North American car making activities under a single executive and assigning the man who built G.M.'s Saturn division to develop standard management and engineering practices across the company. Donald E. Hackworth, the 60-year-old vice president and group executive already in charge of midsize and luxury cars and mini-vans, will also become responsible for Saturn and G.M.'s other small car operations. Richard G. LeFauve, the 63-year-old G.M. vice president in charge of Saturn since 1986 as well as the group executive in charge of small cars since 1994, will instead oversee an effort to create a single G.M. corporate culture and standard engineering practices. Both men will change jobs on April 1.
3/9/1997	To Zig or Not to Zig: G.M. Takes On Lexus	PITY poor Cadillac. Just when it wrangles an invitation to the midsize-luxury-car ball, the Lexus ES 300 shows up in a new gown. For 1997, Cadillac has, at long last, introduced a smaller, sportier car aimed at the baby boomers who would never dream of trading up to the big, ungainly DeVille. With the average age of Cadillac buyers hovering around 65, General Motors' premium division needs to move quickly to appeal to the mass of relative youngsters in their 40's and 50's: its very future is on the line.
3/1/1997	G.M. Expects a 7% to 8% Sales Drop in February	Hurt by slow introductions of a number of redesigned models, the General Motors Corporation estimated late today that its sales dropped 7 percent to 8 percent this month compared with the corresponding period a year ago. Wall Street analysts had expected slightly better. Nicholas J. Colas, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, predicted in a research report this morning that G.M. sales would fall 6 percent in February.
2/28/1997	Electric-Powered Car Is on Drawing Board	One of the most promising technologies to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy in cars and trucks moved a step closer to reality this week as two American auto companies entered into an unusual partnership. The Chrysler Corporation and Delphi Automotive Systems, the giant parts division of the General Motors Corporation, will collaborate to build a prototype car that would derive its power not from an internal combustion engine, but from fuel cells that produce electricity.
2/27/1997	Frankel Assignment From Oldsmobile	The Oldsmobile division of the General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had named Frankel & Company in Chicago as its first national promotional marketing agency of record. Billings were estimated at $50 million to $60 million.
2/25/1997	Saab Executive Sees Profitability in '99	Saab Automobile A.B. is relying on the introduction of two new models, improvements in the way its dealers treat customers and marketing refinements to increase its sales and bring it back into the black, a Saab executive said today. While conceding that Saab is unlikely to turn a profit this year or next, Joel K. Manby, president of Saab Cars U.S.A. Inc., said the company should be profitable by 1999. ''We will continue to lose money in 1997, and we will continue to lose money for about half of 1998,'' Mr. Manby said.
2/25/1997	If You Can't Remember D-Day, G.M.'s Luxury Nameplate Wants You	For more than 15 years now, Cadillac has watched its faithful buyers grow silver-haired and age beyond their driving years. And every few years, the General Motors division has tried to lure younger buyers with cars designed to appeal to them, instead of their parents. The Cimarron. The Allante. The Seville STS. The first two are already gone, and the last has not brought in enough younger customers to turn the tide. From a peak of 350,813 cars in 1978, or a third of the luxury car market in the United States, once-powerful Cadillac has become one of G.M.'s weakest units, selling just 170,379 cars last year, or a sixth of luxury sales.
2/21/1997	Researcher Says How C.E.O.'s Act Is Linked To Order in the Family	It is a classic management problem. A company is rolling along, unaware that the bumps it is hitting signal the need to change the way it does business. It isn't really broke, the chief executive thinks, so there's no need to fix it. A little tinkering will do the trick. But as company after company -- from Eastman Kodak to General Motors to I.B.M. -- has shown, that way lies disaster.
2/20/1997	G.M. May Sell Up to 20% Of Merged Parts Business	The General Motors Corporation is considering selling up to 20 percent of its huge automotive electronics and auto parts units, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said today. G.M. is in the process of adding its Delco Electronics Corporation to its Delphi Automotive Systems unit to form the world's largest auto supplier, with 210,000 employees and revenue of approximately $32 billion. G.M. also acknowledged today that it was cooperating with the Justice Department, which is investigating whether employees of G.M. or Volkswagen accepted kickbacks to steer contracts to auto suppliers.
2/19/1997	Catera Ad Pulled By Cadillac	The General Motors Corporation has pulled a TV commercial for its small Cadillac Catera because of concerns that the ad might offend women. The spot, by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, a unit of the MacManus Group, cost about $2 million to produce and run during the Super Bowl. Featuring the model Cindy Crawford, it has since appeared on a number of prime-time shows. In the ad, Ms. Crawford portrays a princess wearing knee-high leather boots and a tight black leather minidress with a plunging neckline.
2/18/1997	G.M. Is Speaking Out on the Dollar and Other Issues	Just four years ago, a senior General Motors executive from Detroit appalled a roomful of diplomats and trade negotiators at an embassy dinner in Washington by loudly arguing that the nation's capital did not really matter because it did not manufacture anything. That attitude, once common at the nation's biggest company, is now fading quickly. As the auto maker builds new factories in Poland, Thailand and Argentina, and as the rising dollar has helped propel sales of foreign cars in America, the General Motors Corporation is becoming much more active on public policy issues.
2/14/1997	A General Motors Axle Supplier Is Also Facing a Strike Deadline	The Allied Pilots Association at American Airlines is not the only union that has set a strike deadline of 12:01 A.M. on Saturday. The United Automobile Workers union's contract with a critical supplier of the General Motors Corporation will expire at the same time, and the union has prepared itself for a strike. The U.A.W. is negotiating a new labor contract with American Axle and Manufacturing Inc., an 8,600-employee company spun off by G.M. nearly three years ago. People close to the talks said that considerable progress was being made but would not rule out the possibility of a strike. The U.A.W. has also allowed its members to remain on the job beyond the expiration of labor contracts in the past, most recently at the Ford Motor Company last September.
2/5/1997	Ford's Sales Increase 2.8%, While Toyota's Soar 55%	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales rose 2.8 percent in January from a year ago, while Toyota said its sales jumped 55.5 percent. The final tally of sales figures showed that in January, American auto makers lost ground to their Japanese and European competitors. Over all, auto sales rose 6.3 percent last month, with car sales up 8.3 percent and truck sales up 3.8 percent.
2/4/1997	January Car Sales Up 2.3%; Foreign Makers Have Surge	Foreign auto makers showed the biggest sales gains in the American auto market last month as the strong dollar continued to help them offer generous lease deals and low prices. Among the nine auto makers reporting January results today, sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago. Foreign auto makers reporting results today saw their combined sales rise 10.9 percent, while the combined sales of the two American auto makers reporting results today dropped a tenth of 1 percent.
2/4/1997	Agencies Dissolve G.M. Partnership	A partnership formed in May between Bronner Slosberg Humphrey in Boston and units of McCann-Erickson Worldwide to work on direct marketing assignments for the General Motors Corporation has been dissolved.
1/29/1997	G.M. Says Profits Fell Throughout 1996	Weighed down by some of the heaviest strike-related losses ever suffered by an American company, the General Motors Corporation announced today that its profits fell in the fourth quarter and for all of 1996 from a year earlier. G.M. said that two strikes last October had reduced its after-tax income in the fourth quarter by $700 million, while another strike last March in Dayton, Ohio, reduced the company's 1996 after-tax income by another $500 million. Several industrial relations experts said that the total of $1.2 billion in strike-related, after-tax losses appeared to be a record before adjusting for inflation.
1/28/1997	G.M. Increases Payout and Sets Stock Buyback	With its cash reserves soaring and its pension plan fully financed, the General Motors Corporation announced a dividend increase and a $2.5 billion stock buyback today in its first big effort to reduce the number of shares outstanding. G.M. raised the quarterly dividend on its common stock to 50 cents a share from 40 cents, the third 10-cent increase since May 1995. The company intends to buy back roughly 5 percent of the shares outstanding over the next 12 months, which could drive up the value of the remaining shares by making them more scarce.
1/27/1997	4,100 G.M. Workers on Strike at an Ohio Vehicle Assembly Plant	Close to 4,100 workers went on strike against the General Motors Corporation late Saturday night at a huge sport utility vehicle assembly plant in Moraine, Ohio, the fourth big strike against the world's largest auto maker in less than a year. The International Union of Electronics Workers ordered the strike at midnight on Saturday after workers voted on Friday night against ratification of a new labor agreement that their leaders had concluded earlier in the week. The pact was controversial because it included a new program designed to penalize workers with high rates of absenteeism.
1/26/1997	Solid Old Cadillac	You know that downsizing has gone too far when Cadillac comes up with a new type of car that's no bigger than a Lexus. This fall, in its most craven attempt to appeal to a younger market, the company that defined spacious luxury at its most American started selling the Catera. It's made in Germany, of all places, and is being billed as ''the Caddy that zigs.'' ''Cadillac,'' a General Motors apologist recently stated, ''has a lot of baggage . . . to get over.'' Personally, I think there's a lot to be said for baggage. Baggage is our cultural history. It's Elvis's honey-gold Cadillac and the pink one Aretha Franklin sang about in ''Freeway of Love.'' Baggage is also Hunter Thompson's lifelong yearning to blow up a virgin Cadillac, which he fulfilled over the holidays.
1/22/1997	Foreign Car Makers Seek Low End of Sport Utility Niche	Clutching a white plastic shopping bag full of car brochures, Carolyn Spicer, a 52-year-old credit union manager, stood at the North American International Auto Show here and carefully studied the light-gray, Jeep-like Honda CR-V on the platform. After looking at it from the front and the side, she guessed it would sell for $25,000 when it goes on sale next month. So she was surprised to learn that the sticker price would be just $19,300 for a well-equipped model. ''If they keep that price,'' she said, ''it's going to really go.''
1/18/1997	Forget Armageddon, Think Commercial Potential	Millennium fever is spreading through popular culture, and corporate America has caught the bug. Companies large and small figure that an event capable of inspiring apocalyptic novels, doomsday prophecies, $2,000 Jeroboams of wine and plans for 24-hour blowouts in the world's 24 time zones to ring in the year 2000 has got to have some sort of commercial potential.
1/17/1997	G.M. to Sell A Hughes Unit To Raytheon	In what is expected to be one of the last major takeovers in the weapons industry, the Raytheon Company announced today that it had agreed to acquire the military businesses of the Hughes Electronics Corporation from the General Motors Corporation for the equivalent of $9.5 billion. Under the terms of the extremely complex deal, which followed a lengthy auction process, Raytheon, a manufacturer of missiles, radar and appliances, based in Lexington, Mass., will assume about $4.4 billion in debt that will be issued as part of the transaction and will pay about $5.1 billion in the form of newly issued stock. The new company will produce such weapons as air-to-air missiles, antitank weapons, ground and air radar, communications systems and sonar and mine-hunting equipment.
1/17/1997	Northrop, Losing Bid, Still Hopes To Contend	The Raytheon Company's successful bid for Hughes Electronics leaves the Northrop Grumman Corporation as the wallflower in the twirling military industry discotheque, raising questions about its ability to compete against the three titans that soon will dominate the aerospace business. Northrop Grumman -- itself the product of a multibillion-dollar merger in 1994 -- now faces the stark prospect of finding a suitable combination partner or falling into the second rank of military contractors.
1/17/1997	G.M.'s Goal Is to Increase Shareholder Value	To understand why the General Motors Corporation is selling the Hughes Electronics Corporation's aerospace division, it helps to look at a couple of numbers: the aerospace division accounts for 4 percent of G.M.'s sales, but is being sold for a sum equal to nearly a fifth of the value of G.M.'s outstanding stock. G.M. executives have grumbled for years that investors value the company as just an auto maker, a business long out of fashion on Wall Street. In the last year, some executives have even taken to musing aloud how much their business might be worth if G.M.'s $160 billion in annual sales came from Internet services.
1/16/1997	G.M. Selects Mullen For Used-Car Account	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had named Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., as the first agency to handle advertising for its certified used-car program meant to compete with chains like Carmax and Auto Nation. Though billings were not disclosed, trade publications estimated them at $25 million to $40 million in the first year and as much as $75 million in the second year. Dean Rotando, a spokesman for G.M. in Warren, Mich., said that Mullen was awarded the account after a five-month review that began with 12 agencies and had been narrowed to Mullen and 3 other finalists: N. W. Ayer & Partners in New York, a unit of MacManus Group, which handles corporate advertising for G.M.; Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, owned by top managers and the Interpublic Group of Companies, and the TL Partnership in Dallas, a unit of Omnicom Group. (Trade publications, however, reported that the review had been further narrowed to a choice between Mullen and Ayer.)
1/12/1997	A Home-Grown Revival Of the Sports Car	SPORTS cars go fast, and most are gone before long. But the Chevrolet Corvette has had an unprecedented 45-year run since the first white convertible rolled off a temporary assembly line in Flint, Mich., in 1953. Credit a cult of buyers who made it the best-selling two-seater of all time, with more than a million produced. Now, the first new Corvette since 1984 is appearing. The two-seat coupe is a surprisingly good example of the art of engineering tradeoffs: bigger and more comfortable inside, the '97 Corvette is also more agile and faster than the old one. Also promised are higher quality and lower costs for maintenance, repairs and insurance. Like its predecessors, this fifth-generation Corvette is destined to enchant the faithful and revive debate about what a sports car ought to be. Originally planned for the 40th anniversary in 1993, what's become the 1997-model Corvette was delayed again and again by General Motors. The investment required was small by Detroit standards, $250 million for engineering and new tooling, but large for a company that was racking up billion-dollar losses. Executives wagered that Chevrolet's most expensive car would survive unchanged after an assault from supercars like the Nissan 300ZX, Toyota Supra and MR2 and Mazda RX-7.
1/12/1997	DIARY	THE LOPEZ WARS Feel Better Now, G.M.? Nobody, but nobody, pushes General Motors around: that seemed to be G.M.'s attitude in its four-year fistfight with Volkswagen. Yes, yes, a hotshot G.M. executive named Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua defected to VW, taking with him a few colleagues and, his accusers say, cartons of ''trade secrets.'' But has anyone suggested that VW then started turning out bootleg Chevrolet Cavaliers? That VW drew any serious blood? Well, no. It seemed mainly a pride thing, and G.M. demanded satisfaction -- like an abject apology and, say, $3 billion or $4 billion to ease the pain. Last week, though, it settled for far less: $100 million, still huge by corporate-espionage standards. And did VW apologize? Well, sort of. It acknowledged the ''possibility'' of ''illegal activities.'' STOCK MARKETS As the World Turns The world's financial markets seem to be on a giant seesaw: the more stock prices rise in the United States, the more they fall in Japan. In many ways, the two countries' markets are unrelated. American stocks just keep soaring -- yes, yawn, more records last week -- because they've forgotten how to do anything else, while Japan is plagued by a stagnant economy and bank troubles. But here's one link: American investors have pulled money out of Japan, compounding both the good times here and the bad times there. COCA-COLA When in Doubt, Redesign The soda can speaks of timelessness: Coca-Cola ''Classic,'' it assures us. It's ''Always.'' It's ''Unique.'' And the stuff inside most definitely stays the same -- no way is Coke going to mess with that again. But for all the intimations of eternity, Coke just can't stop tinkering with the can. Add a ribbon -- a ''dynamic ribbon,'' if you please -- or subtract a ribbon. Enlarge, or tilt, the photograph of the old bottle. (Why adorn a container with a photo of a container? Oh, you just don't understand.) And now Coke -- probably the world's most recognized brand -- has done it again, introducing yet another look. Does it really imagine that shoppers, poised in the supermarket aisle, muttering, ''Coke or Pepsi? Coke or Pepsi? Hmmm. Which has the newest design?'' Apparently so. REAL ESTATE Helmsley, Man and Image ''Helmsley,'' over the years, has become an odd sort of name, evoking such a jarring mix of images. Here's the overriding image: of truly serious New York real estate, of the empire built over many decades by Harry Helmsley. But then, yes, there's Leona -- first the mighty queen of the spotless hotel, the ultimate in demanding bosses, then the humbled queen, jailed for tax evasion. The rival images maintained a delicate coexistence even as Mr. Helmsley's health faded. (He was deemed unfit to face tax-evasion charges himself.) But with Mr. Helmsley's death last weekend, all the rules have changed. Though some lawsuits remain to be resolved -- and though Mr. Helmsley did leave some pocket change, $25,000, to his long-time secretary -- his widow is practically the sole heir to his $1.7 billion fortune. New York City, meet the undisputed queen. INAUGURAL SHOPPER Get Your Instant History! You can feel it. All across the land, Americans aren't wondering when the floods will stop, when that new job will appear, when cancer will be cured. No, they are asking themselves, ''What can I do to make the inauguration as lavish as possible?'' Well, the Inaugural Committee heard them, took pity on their anguish and called up QVC. So just tune in that shopping channel, and you will have the rare, one-time, golden opportunity to buy, say, a bronze inaugural medallion for just $36. That's $4 off, of course; it would be un-American to buy something that isn't on sale. Then, just think: one day, tears in your eyes, you can tell your grandchildren that, yes, you were there -- that in January of '97, the very month of the second Clinton inaugural, you were sitting in front of your TV set. PRESERVATION This Land Is Her Land The idea of owning 51,000 acres in the Adirondacks seems wildly out of kilter -- it belongs to another era. And the vast Whitney estate was, in fact, carved out in the robber-baron days. But it's still there, in the heart of a six-million-acre park, and preservationists have been longing to add it to public lands. It's ''the missing puzzle piece,'' one environmental lobbyist said. Subdividing it would be ''the greatest disaster for the Adirondacks I could imagine.'' But Marylou Whitney, the society-queen heir to the estate, wants to do exactly that. Last week she proposed slicing off 15,000 of those acres and creating what in her circle are no doubt considered low-rent lots: a mere 300 acres each. And, oh yes: you could also buy Little Tupper Lake. It's all a ploy, some critics say, to drive up the price for the obvious buyer: New York State.
1/11/1997	G.M. Never Wavered in Its 4-Year Fight Over Executive Who Defected to VW	By the time he walked into Robert Strauss's Washington law office Tuesday afternoon, Jens Neumann, the chief lawyer for Volkswagen A.G., knew who was holding the cards: the General Motors Corporation. For nearly four years, Mr. Neumann had been locked in a bitter and visceral legal battle with G.M. over accusations of industrial spying. As recently as a year ago, VW had managed to bog down G.M.'s case against Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former G.M. executive who stood accused of stealing thousands of documents when he defected to Volkswagen. It was a legal tangle that the shrewd Mr. Neumann and Mr. Strauss, the influential Democrat and former ambassador who worked for VW, had helped throw around General Motors.
1/10/1997	G.M. OF CANADA TO BUILD 240 ARMORED CARS	The Canadian Government said yesterday that it had awarded a contract for 240 armored cars, worth $552 million (Canadian), or $407 million (United States), to the diesel division of General Motors of Canada Ltd., a unit of the General Motors Corporation. Deliveries of the armored cars are to start in January 1998 and be completed in December 1999. The division is based in London, Ontario.
1/10/1997	Bids for Hughes Electronics Rest on Future Stock Value	The two bids for the military businesses of the Hughes Electronics Corporation are likely to come to perhaps $10 billion, but will hinge less on their face value than tax considerations and estimates of the future value of the stock of the winning company, people close to the situation said today. The Raytheon Company and the Northrop Grumman Corporation both submitted bid packages that came to nearly 500 pages each, these people said, and the General Motors Corporation, Hughes's parent, is expected to choose a winner as early as next week, though perhaps sooner.
1/10/1997	VW AGREES TO PAY G.M. $100 MILLION IN ESPIONAGE SUIT	Bringing to an end a four-year feud between two of the world's largest companies, Volkswagen A.G. agreed today to pay $100 million to the General Motors Corporation to settle accusations that VW stole trade secrets from G.M. In the settlement, one of the largest in a corporate espionage case, Volkswagen also agreed to buy at least $1 billion worth of auto parts from the American company during the next seven years. Both companies also agreed to drop their civil suits against each other.
1/9/1997	G.M. to Regain American Market Share, Executives Say	General Motors executives said here today that they expected to reverse the long decline in the company's share of the American market while expanding G.M.'s highly profitable overseas operations. Crippled by strikes and plagued by slow introductions of new models, G.M. has lost sales in the United States over the last year even faster than it had been in recent years; the company's American market share has been shrinking steadily since the early 1960's. G.M. officials encouraged financial analysts last month to reduce their estimates of the company's fourth-quarter earnings, while the company's stock has underperformed the market as investors have become impatient.
1/7/1997	Raytheon Wins Arms Unit in Texas, Though At High Price	The Raytheon Company has won the bidding for Texas Instruments' military business, but victory may have come at a rich price, analysts said today. Raytheon has agreed to pay $2.95 billion in cash for a division that makes missiles, radar systems, night-vision equipment and electronic warfare gear. The purchase illustrates Raytheon's determination to prevail amid a brutal consolidation in the industry and signals the company's status as a possible contender for a much larger prize: the Hughes Electronics military business, which is being sold by General Motors for perhaps $9 billion.
1/4/1997	G.M. Sales Tumbled 14% In December	The General Motors Corporation reported today that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped nearly 14 percent last month compared with the corresponding period a year ago, even as the Chrysler Corporation reported a sales gain. Analysts said G.M.'s sales decline underscored the company's continuing problems building its restyled models and getting them to dealer lots. Most auto makers reported December sales today, and the G.M. numbers pulled down the results for the industry. December sales for the 15 auto makers that announced their sales today dropped 7.9 percent, to 746,359 units, compared with the same period a year ago. Excluding G.M.'s poor showing, sales for the month rose 2.4 percent. Today's report did not include sales for the Ford Motor Company, which is expected to report on Monday.
1/1/1997	Charges Against Schott Could Affect Her Role With Reds	Marge Schott, whose ethnic and racial comments have undermined her position as managing partner of the Cincinnati Reds, faces potentially more serious trouble in baseball over charges of fraudulent sales reports that General Motors has lodged against her with a state regulatory board in Ohio. The charges were filed four weeks ago and got the attention of baseball officials when they surfaced last week.
12/29/1996	An Emotional Rescue From More of the Same	PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better. While critics of the auto industry argue that much more progress can be made on safety, durability and fuel efficiency -- and even that the internal-combustion engine should be retired -- there is little doubt that today's cars are far superior in all respects to their predecessors of just a decade ago. Fresh designs use space more effectively. Computer controls make engines start easier and run smoother. Electronic transmissions shift gears for optimum power and economy. Air bags, side-impact beams and ''crumple zones'' -- not to mention antilock brakes and traction controls -- have helped to reduce fatalities and serious injuries. More thought goes into the controls and more care goes into the way the pieces are assembled.
12/25/1996	G.M. Charges Schott	General Motors has accused MARGE SCHOTT, the Cincinnati Reds' owner, of falsifying car sales at her Chevrolet-Geo dealership. G.M. filed a document Dec. 4 with the State of Ohio Motor Vehicle Dealers Board alleging that Schott falsified 57 retail sales last year. The document says Schott hid some of the cars at her Indian Hill estate in suburban Cincinnati and later sold them at auctions or as ''used'' cars.
12/23/1996	Settle G.M.-VW Rift, For Diplomacy's Sake	To the Editor: Now that German prosecutors have indicted Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua (Business Day, Dec. 14) as an industrial spy, it is time General Motors and Volkswagen came to a speedy settlement of the litigation. The acerbic charges and countercharges between these two great corporations are beginning to erode good will between Germany and the United States in an insidious way -- to a degree far beyond the dispute.
12/20/1996	G.M. Encourages Analysts To Cut Earnings Estimates	A variety of marketing, sales and production costs has led the General Motors Corporation to encourage analysts to reduce their estimates of the company's fourth-quarter earnings. Those costs include higher rebates, heavy spending on advertising, slowing car sales, slightly heavier loan losses and the aftereffects of two large strikes. With the exception of the strikes and the loan losses, most of the company's setbacks reflected the renewed competition the company faces from Japanese and European auto makers.
12/15/1996	Cars That Tell You Where to Go	DON'T toss out your road maps just yet, though you may be needing them less. A number of navigation and communications systems are taking their places in cars, promising to get you where you want to go and even making reservations for your arrival. Several systems are on the market, and more are coming. In Japan, a bellwether in automotive gadgetry, navigation systems are as common as cellular phones.
12/14/1996	G.M. Recalls Cavalier Sedans in Japan	The General Motors Corporation has recalled three-quarters of the cars that the Toyota Motor Company sold for G.M. in Japan under Toyota nameplates. Owners of the Cavalier sedans have complained that the cars stall in Japan's stop-and-go traffic, G.M. said. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries because of the problem, a G.M. spokesman, Mike Meyerand, said.
12/14/1996	Prosecutors Give Details of Case Charging Lopez As Industrial Spy	German prosecutors gave details yesterday of the charges against Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former General Motors executive who left for Volkswagen A.G. and who was indicted this week. At a news conference in Darmstadt, Germany, and in a statement, the prosecutors said they believed they had sufficient evidence to prove that Mr. Lopez committed these acts:
12/12/1996	In Japan, U.S. Auto Makers Fare Worse Than Expected	The Neon sat under a garish arch of rainbow-colored lights. But neither the glare nor the special low-interest financing was enough to attract even glances from the few customers at the Yokohama Chrysler dealer one recent Sunday. ''When the Neon was released, I think most Japanese were interested because of the price,'' said Kentaro Oba, a 36-year-old engineer, who, like most customers, was interested in the sexier Jeep Wrangler. ''But the Neon was delayed in coming to Japan, and in the meantime Japanese companies have cut prices.''
12/12/1996	Lopez Indicted by Germans And Charged in G.M. Theft	German prosecutors have indicted Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former General Motors executive who switched to Volkswagen A.G., on charges of embezzlement and theft of confidential documents from G.M., the auto makers and lawyers for Mr. Lopez said today. The charges, which had been expected for several weeks, are somewhat less severe than the fraud charges General Motors had originally sought; they carry a maximum prison term of three years rather than five. Also as expected, prosecutors will not file criminal charges against Volkswagen's top executives or board members, as G.M. had wanted.
12/11/1996	VW Strives To Make Up With G.M.	With a flurry of activity the last two weeks, Volkswagen A.G. is desperately trying to put an end to the messy affair over its hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former purchasing star at the General Motors Corporation. It has offered its regrets; it has accepted Mr. Lopez's resignation, and it has proposed elements of a settlement. But VW's olive branches have only jabbed further at G.M., and the American auto maker's long-running campaign for revenge seems further from resolution than it has been in a while, according to people close to the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
12/11/1996	Ford Returning to Suburb, Souring Detroit Real Estate Shift	Dealing a blow to this city's hopes of an economic revival, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it was moving 2,500 office workers out of the downtown area and back to its base in suburban Dearborn. Ford plans to transfer all of its workers out of the Renaissance Center, a complex of five skyscrapers that the General Motors Corporation bought this autumn, by the end of 1998. G.M. is moving its headquarters from a 74-year-old midtown office building to the downtown center.
12/8/1996	A Buyer Is About to Close on Bristol's G.M. Plant	THE 1.25-million-square-foot General Motors ball-bearings plant in Bristol, reported to be the largest one-story manufacturing building in New England, has been contracted for sale to SF Bristol, a partnership of Harold Fetner and David Swersky, New York City real estate developers. A closing is to be held in about a week. Originally marketed at $10 million when the plant closed in 1994, the price was reduced to $8.5 million and finally sold to SF Bristol for $5 million, including 182 acres of land on which the plant stands.
12/8/1996	Unplug It, Drive It	A few years back, when other states and Washington were arguing endlessly about what to do about tailpipe smog and an overdependence on foreign oil, California went off and decreed that, by year 2003, 1 of every 10 cars sold in the state would have to be powered by electricity. The big oil companies cried unfair and the big auto makers warned that foreseeable technology was not up to the job. But last week, with hoopla fit for a Hollywood premiere, General Motors began leasing assembly-line electric cars in the Golden State -- sleek little coupes with plenty of get-up-and-go but, alas, only enough battery power for about 90 miles of travel before an inconvenient three-hour recharge is required. As the first of the cars hummed out of a Los Angeles showroom, there was plenty of carping that for all its fancy looks and pep, it would never be a best seller; its range is hardly up to a good L.A. commute and its monthly leasing and operating cost is a stiff $550. But General Motors promised greater range and economy in years to come. And some other American and Japanese car makers said they too would jump into the competition. B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.
12/7/1996	G.M. TO BUILD FEWER AUTOS THAN PLANNED IN NEXT QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it planned to build 1.41 million cars and trucks in North America in the first quarter of 1997, which is 46,000 fewer than it had planned to build a year earlier before an Ohio strike crippled production. Compared with the strike-reduced output, G. M. planned to produce 16 percent more vehicles in the first three months of 1997 than in the 1996 quarter. The strike in Dayton, Ohio, cut G. M.'s production by 240,000. Yesterday's numbers are conservative and show that G. M. is cautious about the number of vehicles it can sell, analysts said. G. M. has eight plants that are shifting over to build new models, a process that generally slows production. G. M. shares fell $2.25 yesterday, to $56.50.
12/6/1996	Chrysler to Raise Its Dividend and Shift Top Management	With brisk sales of Jeeps and mini-vans producing a torrent of cash, the Chrysler Corporation said today that it would raise its quarterly dividend, buy back more stock, and make management changes aimed at rewarding some of the executives responsible for the company's success. Wall Street welcomed the 5-cent rise in the dividend to 40 cents a share and the doubling of the amount of stock Chrysler plans to buy back next year to $2 billion. Chrysler stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $35.875. The management changes, which had been expected, were announced after the market closed.
12/6/1996	With No Tailpipe But Much Fanfare, A New Car Arrives	With all the klieg-light hoopla and hype of a Hollywood premiere, the first electric car to be mass-produced in this country in modern times went on sale here today, a sleek, whisper-quiet little two-seater packed with state-of-the-art batteries and the nation's hopes for an end to tailpipe pollution and heavy dependence on foreign oil. ''What you have here is the beginning of a revolution,'' said Don Devlin, a retired film producer and writer, as he took possession of a car and, with the punch of a button and the pull of a lever, hum-m-m-ed out into the gridlock and smog of the one American city that is more car-crazed than even Detroit.
12/6/1996	Car Companies In United States Hurt by Imports	Japanese and European auto makers have come roaring back in the United States this autumn, by cutting prices and increasing rebates. After several years of gradually winning back buyers, American auto makers, particularly General Motors, are facing their toughest competition since the early 1990's.
12/5/1996	Ford Reports Vehicle Sales Dropped 2.2% in November	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales fell 2.2 percent in November, as the final tally of monthly auto sales showed that American companies had lost ground to Japanese and European competitors. The Big Three American auto makers built 72.1 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the United States in November, down sharply -- three percentage points -- from the levels during November 1995. Foreign auto makers, especially Honda and Toyota, gained market share given up by American companies, particularly the General Motors Corporation. G.M.'s market share dipped below 30 percent for the third month this year, analysts said.
12/4/1996	G.M. Has a 2d Poor Month As Sales Are Down 11.9%	The General Motors Corporation reported dismal auto sales today for the second month in a row, even as many other auto makers announced gains in their November sales. G.M., the world's largest auto maker, said its sales last month dropped to 336,815, down 11.9 percent from November 1995. Car sales dropped 22.5 percent, while sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 4.2 percent.
12/4/1996	The Dow Falls 79.01 Points In Late Selloff	With concern rising that rallies in the dollar and bonds might be stalling, stocks quavered and then tumbled late yesterday as the General Motors Corporation reported poor auto sales for November. The Dow Jones industrial average was already down 37 points at 3:46 P.M., when G.M. said that its car sales slid 22.5 percent in November. The Dow then fell another 42 points in the next 14 minutes, as most large stocks dropped sharply in price. The Dow closed down 79.01 points at 6,442.69.
12/4/1996	Electric appliances come alive to sell their G.M. sibling, the EV1.	COMMON household appliances are the stars of a spectacular spot that signals the start of ambitious efforts intended to create interest in an uncommon car. The spot, by Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco, promotes the EV1, the electric-powered two-seat coupe that the General Motors Corporation will make available by lease at Saturn dealerships in four Western markets. The first electric car in decades will be a tough sell because of its high price, more than the cost of a Lexus lease; its limited driving range, 70 to 90 miles, and its lengthy recharging period, 3 to 14 hours.
12/3/1996	VW Promotes A Key Figure In G.M. Fight	Ignoring an ultimatum from the General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen A.G. has promoted a former G.M. executive who G.M. had demanded be dismissed in the legal dispute between the two companies. Volkswagen said today that it had appointed the executive, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, to take the seat on the company's managing board vacated by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former G.M. executive who was forced to step down as VW's purchasing chief last week. Mr. Garcia Sanz will take over the purchasing operations directed by Mr. Lopez.
12/1/1996	After the Dustbuster, a Clean Sweep	GENERAL MOTORS may still be the Goliath of Detroit, but it had long seemed powerless to fend off mini-van attacks from the auto industry's Davids. While Chrysler remained the king of small vans and other companies offered competitive models, G.M. struggled to come up with a mini-van that could hold its own in the surging market. The rear-drive Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari attract buyers who tow boats and trailers, but they are too trucklike to win over the mass mini-van market. And G.M.'s first front-drive mini-vans -- the Chevrolet Lumina APV, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Trans Sport -- proved far too radical for most buyers, with their Dustbuster shape, steeply raked windshield and a dashboard that seemed to stretch from here to eternity.
11/30/1996	President Out As VW Seeks G.M. Truce	Thomas Andersson had already been unnerved once by his two roommates, when he walked in to find they had moved in paper-shredders and were busily destroying documents in the house they shared in Wiesbaden, about 20 miles from here. When he later discovered four cartons of what seemed to be confidential documents from General Motors in his living room, he decided to call the police. That call, on June 21, 1993, may well have been the beginning of the end of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's career as a top executive at Volkswagen A.G.
11/29/1996	A Chronology of an International Corporate Feud	1992 APRIL -- John F. Smith Jr. leaves his job as head of General Motors Europe to become chief executive of the General Motors Corporation. MAY -- Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua follows his mentor to Detroit as head of global purchasing, with a mission to slash the company's production costs. 1993 MARCH 8 -- At an international strategy meeting in Germany, Mr. Lopez learns that G.M. is not planning a super-efficient plant in his native land, the Basque region of Spain, and if the plant is built at all it will be in Hungary or Poland. John Howell, director of business planning for G.M. Europe, later testified that Mr. Lopez asked for copies of papers relating to the top-secret O-car to be made at such a plant.
11/29/1996	VW Official Is Expected To Resign	After three years of fighting accusations that he stole cartons upon cartons of secret documents from the General Motors Corporation, the president of Volkswagen A.G. is expected to resign on Friday. The departure of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would be a significant turning point in G.M.'s bitter and deeply personal campaign against its former purchasing director. The drawn-out case, which had provoked dozens of court actions, appeared to be gaining momentum in recent days. On Tuesday, a Federal judge in Detroit ruled that General Motors could invoke racketeering charges against Volkswagen. And German prosecutors were expected to file their own criminal charges against Mr. Lopez and several other former G.M. executives who went to VW in 1993 with Mr. Lopez, a colorful celebrity in the button-down ranks of auto management.
11/21/1996	F.T.C. Said to Reach Agreement On Improper Auto Lease Ads	The Federal Trade Commission is planning to announce on Thursday that it has reached an agreement with five auto makers accused of improperly advertising auto lease deals, according to people familiar with the agreement. The companies involved are the General Motors Corporation, Honda Motor, Mazda Motor, Isuzu Motor and Mitsubishi Motor , said people with a detailed knowledge of the matter who insisted on anonymity.
11/20/1996	General Motors Output Lags Behind Demand for New Models	The General Motors Corporation has a mixed blessing this autumn: It finally has some popular new models, but under its manufacturing schedule the new cars and mini-vans are arriving in dealerships in a trickle, not a flood. The new Pontiac Grand Prix was an instant hit, but dealers have been unable to keep it in stock, and some complained that potential buyers were turning to imports instead. The new Cadillac Catera, intended as G.M.'s answer to high-performance European luxury cars, is being sold only in a few dealerships in the biggest markets, like California. And G.M.'s new generation of mini-vans, enthusiastically received by auto reviewers, has barely begun to arrive in showrooms, as production lags behind even the company's modest goals.
11/19/1996	Auto Industry 'Celebrity' Followed by Controversy	Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is probably the auto industry's closest approximation of a celebrity, though whether of the Bonnie and Clyde variety, or the Einstein, is hotly debated, particularly in Detroit. His abrupt departure from General Motors in 1993 to become Volkswagen's head of purchasing gave rise to 11 lawsuits, including one brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. G.M. accuses Mr. Lopez, its former vice president for purchasing, of stealing company secrets, including purchase lists and strategic plans for a prototype factory called Plant X.
11/19/1996	Is VW's New Plant Lean, Or Just Mean?	At first glance, the work force at Volkswagen's truck and bus factory here seems like any other, clad in unremarkable gray uniforms. But look at the pockets, and you will see the key to what Volkswagen executives call the factory of the future. The names stitched there are Rockwell, Cummins, Remon and MWM. What are conspicuously scarce are Volkswagen workers. In this new factory some 100 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, Volkswagen employs a mere 200 of the 1,000 workers, those responsible only for overall quality control, marketing, and research and design. The assembly work -- from counting spark plugs to bolting down engines -- is left to suppliers.
11/17/1996	Look, Ma, No Gas!	Don't try to tell Jack Smith that electric cars are a pipe dream. Mr. Smith, chairman of General Motors, drove one of the company's first electric models onto a transporter last week in Lansing, Mich. On Dec. 5, they will be available for lease at 26 Saturn dealerships.
11/16/1996	As Glory Fades for Cadillacs, a Failed Dealer Sues G.M.	The convertible glided along the city streets, engine humming, finish glowing, fins sailing. It was a 1950's Cadillac Coupe de Ville, top of the line, best of the best. To Dick Gidron, a skinny boy from the south side of Chicago, it was glory on wheels. And entirely out of reach.
11/15/1996	G.M. CHANGES TOP MANAGEMENT OF ITS DELCO UNIT	The General Motors Corporation announced a shake-up yesterday at the top of the Delco Electronics Corporation as part of a plan to make the electrical auto parts business more competitive. Gary W. Dickinson, 58, will retire on Jan. 1 from his post as president and chief executive of Delco, after a three-year tenure. He will be replaced by Michael Burns, 44, who was general manager of Delphi Thermal Systems, a unit of Delphi Automotive Systems, G.M.'s other auto parts company. General Motors is struggling to improve both Delco and Delphi. The shake-up was reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal. General Motors also said yesterday, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that labor strikes in the United States and Canada would cost the company $700 million in the fourth quarter, while increased retirement benefits would cost it $170 million.
11/12/1996	Ford Joins Move to Used Car Warranties as New Rivals Grow	The Ford Motor Company today became the latest auto maker to offer a warranty program for used cars from its dealers, with the first ''quality certified'' used Fords to be sold next week from some dealerships in the Southeast. The program is expected to be available at dealers nationwide next spring. Guy M. Bertram, Ford's regional marketing manager, said he expected that 250,000 to 300,000 used Fords annually would be sold under the warranty program. An additional 20,000 low-mileage Lincoln used cars will be sold each year under a separate warranty program.
11/12/1996	STRIKES CAUSE G.M. TO CUT 4TH-QUARTER PRODUCTION	The General Motors Corporation has cut its planned fourth-quarter production of cars and trucks 11 percent because of strikes in Canada and the United States, costing the auto maker an estimated $666 million. The company slashed 151,000 cars and trucks from its production schedule for the period and said it would now build 1.169 million vehicles in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Last month's 20-day walkout by the Canadian Automobile Workers eventually shut down all of G.M.'s Canadian assembly plants. Two strikes by United Automobile Workers union locals shut down five United States truck plants earlier this month. G.M., the world's largest auto maker, said the strikes canceled the production of 113,000 cars and 38,000 trucks.
11/10/1996	When Your Basic Sport Utilities Start Putting On Airs	AS a teen-ager in the muscle-car-mad 1960's, I never fantasized about the pedal-to-the-metal street rods that were burning rubber all around me. My dream machine was a school bus -- a big box high above the road, the better to see anything and everything. I had forgotten about wanting to play Big Bad Wolf behind the wheel until I climbed into the 1997 Oldsmobile Bravada, which is essentially a fancy version of the tried-and-true Chevrolet Blazer. Then it dawned on me: sport utility vehicles are essentially big picture boxes. And it turns out that two of the newest sport utilities are school-bus simple. The Bravada, which was revived for 1996 after a one-year absence, and a chief rival, the Mercury Mountaineer, take the guesswork out of barreling through bad weather and tackling treacherous roads.
11/9/1996	Charges Expected Against VW President	Prosecutors in Germany are expected to file criminal charges of industrial spying against Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the president of Volkswagen A.G., in connection with his departure from General Motors in 1993. Volkswagen executives and a lawyer for Mr. Lopez said today that they expected prosecutors in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt, to file criminal charges before the end of this month.
11/8/1996	In Alamo Deal, Republic Puts More Money On Used Cars	H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries stepped up its expansion into the growing used car industry yesterday, when it announced it had signed an agreement to acquire Alamo Rent-a-Car Inc. for $625 million in stock, thereby insuring a steady supply of vehicles for the company's nascent used auto supermarkets. Alamo, the fourth-largest rental car company in the nation, operates in 42 states, Canada and 10 European countries. It fits neatly, analysts and company officials say, with another recent Republic acquisition: Auto Nation USA, a developing chain of giant-sized used car lots.
11/6/1996	Auto Makers Fell Shy of Expectations	Vehicle sales were below expectations last month, rising only slightly from the lackluster period a year before. Sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans were strong but the results were dragged down by car sales. Overall sales rose 2.2 percent in October, a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.9 million light vehicles. The mediocre sales results could be a factor in the decision next week on interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Wall Street analysts said.
11/5/1996	N. W. Ayer & Partners lands U S West account after losing AT&T in a recent merger agreement.	IT HAS been a while since the words 'N. W. Ayer & Partners'' and ''landed a large account'' have appeared in the same sentence. But that ended yesterday when Ayer was awarded assignments from U S West Inc. -- with an estimated $60 million in billings -- that return the agency to telecommunications. Ayer is the venerable New York shop that has struggled during this decade with problems caused by personnel turmoil, account losses, financial difficulties and abortive mergers. In June, the Ayer parent, Adcom Investors Inc., agreed to be acquired by MacManus Group, the agency company that owns D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Advertising.
11/5/1996	G.M. Workers Remain Out	About 2,150 workers at a General Motors assembly plant in Linden forced to shut down late Friday by a strike at an Indianapolis parts plant will remain out of work until Thursday, union officials said yesterday. The four-day strike was settled on Saturday, but it temporarily cut off the supply of hoods, doors and tailgates that Linden workers affix to G.M. pickups and sport utility trucks, said Charlie Marshall, president of Local 595 of the United Auto Workers union. The shutdown is costing the average assembly line worker $165 a day, Mr. Marshall said.
11/3/1996	G.M.'s Ticket: Family Values	Ending a virtual drought of new products, General Motors greets 1997 with a flood of new models, providing nearly every kind of family transportation one can imagine. Each vehicle will be aimed at a specific type of buyer, the central tenet of the company's new Procter & Gamble-style ''brand management'' strategy. Already making waves is the Pontiac Grand Prix, built on the midsize platform shared with the new Buick Regal and Century, and with the coming Oldsmobile Intrigue. The Grand Prix's styling is sporty and aggressive, and the GTP version has performance to match.
11/3/1996	New Union Contract Lets G.M. Trim Some Labor Costs	After months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations and strikes that idled tens of thousands of workers, the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation concluded a new three-year labor contract early this morning. The deal, which will probably be ratified soon by 215,000 G.M. workers, averted a likely national walkout by the U.A.W. after Election Day. G.M. and the U.A.W. also settled a four-day strike at a crucial truck parts factory in Indianapolis this evening that had idled four G.M. truck assembly plants. Both sides continued trying tonight to resolve a walkout at a highly profitable assembly plant in Janesville, Wis., that makes medium-duty trucks and the mammoth Chevrolet and GMC Suburbans.
11/2/1996	Auto Makers Seek to Reduce the Danger of Air Bags' Impact	Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have asked the Federal safety authorities for emergency permission to switch to air bags that inflate more slowly, seeking to reduce the risk of neck-injury deaths among infants, children and short adults when air bags inflate at up to 200 miles an hour. The auto makers said today they would begin installing such bags within months in cars sold in Canada, where no Government permission is needed. They also said they would work harder to teach adults to keep children in the back seat.
11/2/1996	Contract Settlement Averts Wider Strike At General Motors	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union announced an agreement early this morning on a new three-year labor contract, averting a national strike against the world's largest auto maker and likely bringing to an end the greatest labor unrest in the American automobile industry since 1970. Negotiators did not settle a three-day strike by two local unions, but a resolution of those walkouts seems likely very soon.
11/2/1996	G.M. Car Sales Drop as Other Makers Report Increases	The General Motors Corporation reported today that its car and truck sales dropped 7.9 percent last month from a year earlier, even as Chrysler, Honda and Toyota all announced their highest October sales ever. Wall Street analysts said that it was hard to figure out why G.M.'s sales were weak. G.M. had strong car sales in October 1995; still, the 24 percent drop in car sales, to 215,276, was larger than expected. G.M.'s sales of pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 22.1 percent, to 182,661, but analysts said the gain compared with weak sales last year, when a trucking company strike slowed deliveries of these light trucks.
11/1/1996	Compromise In G.M. Strike Still Elusive	Negotiators from the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation held marathon talks today aimed at settling the third big strike this year against the company, but a compromise remained elusive. The latest round of talks began on Wednesday at 10 A.M. and continued without interruption through Wednesday night and today. The auto industry has a tradition of settling strikes after negotiating sessions lasting as long as 60 hours, a sign that a deal could come in the next several days.
10/31/1996	Job Shifting Is Big Issue In G.M. Talks	The showdown between the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation this autumn is often described as a struggle over corporate downsizing and job security, but as striking workers here are quick to volunteer, the dispute is also about whether corporations owe easier jobs to older workers. Previous labor agreements already make it very expensive for Detroit's auto makers to lay off workers, so that most workers are effectively guaranteed jobs until retirement. In place of layoffs, G.M. has not been hiring replacements for the many retirees among its 215,000 U.A.W. workers, instead asking more overtime of the remaining workers and hiring outside contractors to do less-skilled jobs.
10/31/1996	German Judge Rules G.M., in Discussing Suit, Didn't Slur VW	A German judge threw out Volkswagen A.G.'s defamation suit against the General Motors Corporation today, giving G.M. its third courtroom victory this month in its industrial-espionage case against VW. Judge Gunther Kinnel ruled that G.M.'s Adam Opel unit was well within its rights and did not defame VW when it announced plans to sue the German car maker as a criminal organization under American racketeering laws.
10/31/1996	G.M.'s Choice For Brazil Work	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it has further expanded its relationship with D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles by naming Salles/D.M.B.& B. in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to handle a new nationwide regional marketing program in Brazil. Billings were estimated at $25 million.
10/30/1996	G.M. Workers Walk Off Job At Two Plants	Workers abruptly walked off the job this evening at General Motors' most profitable assembly plant and one of its most important parts factories, as the United Automobile Workers union sought a showdown with the world's largest auto maker over job security. G.M.'s labor contract with the union expired on Sunday night, leaving the workers free to stage strikes without notice. Stephen P. Yokich, the union's president, had said at a press conference on Monday that he would continue negotiating with the auto maker but warned that local units of the union might choose to conduct strikes.
10/29/1996	U.A.W. Says It Will Work Without Pact During Talks	The United Automobile Workers said today that it would continue to negotiate with General Motors and keep workers on the job without a contract, while scheduling a meeting of senior union leaders on Saturday. The U.A.W. president, Stephen P. Yokich, in a rare news conference this morning, expressed disappointment that the contract had expired at 11:59 on Sunday night without a new deal being reached. But Mr. Yokich said he did not believe that a national strike was necessary for now, although he said some union locals might decide to go on strike in the coming days without the approval of the U.A.W.'s national leadership.
10/28/1996	General Motors and U.A.W. Negotiate Past the Contract Deadline	Top officials of the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers continued negotiating after their labor contract expired at 11:59 P.M. Sunday, as workers at several G.M. factories were waiting with picket signs in the event of a possible strike. Raymond A. Deibel Jr., a G.M. spokesman, said a little after midnight that the talks would go on but did not say whether any new deadline had been set.
10/27/1996	America's Favorite Hearse To Join the Dearly Departed	SUBURBAN great-grandparents and Florida retirees will not be the only ones mourning when the last Cadillac Fleetwood rolls off the assembly line late next month. The coach makers who rebuild these behemoths into hearses, limousines and flower cars will be left scrambling to replace them. After years of sliding sales, General Motors is doing away with its big rear-wheel-drive cars -- the Fleetwood, the Buick Roadmaster and the Chevrolet Caprice -- so it can shift its Arlington, Tex., plant to production of trucks, for which demand is strong and growing. All three of those cars are available as hearses, as are Lincolns and even mini-vans, but the Fleetwood has for decades been the high-end favorite of America's funeral directors.
10/26/1996	Union Sets Sunday Night Deadline for G.M.	The United Auto Workers union imposed a deadline of Sunday night for settling contract talks with the General Motors Corporation, setting the stage for a strike if negotiators fail to reach an agreement. The union said it would terminate the expired G.M. contract if no agreement is reached by 11:59 P.M. on Sunday. Traditionally, the UAW does not work without a contract. It did not say workers would strike at that time, but that is considered likely.
10/25/1996	G.M. MAKES SOME PROGRESS IN TALKS WITH AUTO WORKERS	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union made slow progress in labor talks yesterday as G.M.'s Canadian workers began returning to factories after a 20-day strike. But the effects of the Canadian strike continued to ripple through G.M.'s United States operations. G.M. closed a small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, yesterday for as much as two weeks when it ran out of parts from Canada, and it is expected to close a large car factory in Flint, Mich., early next week. Each of the factories has about 5,000 workers. The Lordstown factory makes the Pontiac Sunfire and the Chevrolet Cavalier, which are in the highly competitive and generally unprofitable small-car segment of the market. The Flint factory makes the Pontiac Bonneville and the Buick LeSabre, for which G.M. has ample inventories. By closing these factories, G.M. can make sure that the first parts produced by the returning Canadian workers will go to factories making more profitable models.
10/23/1996	G.M., Union Set Accord In Canada	The General Motors Corporation and the Canadian Automobile Workers union tentatively agreed today on a new three-year labor contract, settling a 20-day strike that closed assembly plants and parts factories across Ontario and Quebec and, in a ripple effect, idled nearly 20,000 workers in the United States and Mexico. The deal represents a compromise for each side, with the union allowing G.M. to sell two auto parts factories while demanding stiff payments to workers in exchange. Auto analysts said the deal would do fairly little to reduce the auto maker's steep labor costs, but that G.M. had sent a message to both the Canadian union and the United Automobile Workers union in Detroit that it would not give in easily.
10/22/1996	G.M. and Canadian Union Press for Deal to End Strike	Representatives of the General Motors Corporation and the Canadian Automobile Workers union were unable to resolve tonight a few remaining issues in a 19-day strike, as G.M. cut production at four more American assembly plants and temporarily laid off nearly 11,000 more American workers. Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, and D. Stewart Low, a G.M. spokesman, said that the two sides had reached the framework of a deal that would allow G.M. to sell two Canadian auto parts factories and would put some new rules on the auto maker's purchase of parts from outside vendors. But negotiators were having difficulty settling the details and resolving a series of disputes at factories, notably a disagreement over whether G.M. should be allowed to require more overtime from workers at car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario.
10/21/1996	No Agreement In G.M. Strike By Canadians	Negotiators trying to end an 18-day strike by Canadian auto workers against the General Motors Corporation made little progress over the weekend, but remained hopeful that a deal might be reached before a deadline of noon Monday. Roughly 26,000 Canadian workers are on strike against G.M., prompting the company, the world's largest auto maker, to lay off temporarily 7,500 workers at factories in the United States and Mexico that use or supply parts for the Canadian operations. While G.M. has stockpiled Canadian parts, they are running low. Some additional American workers will be idled for at least a few days.
10/17/1996	G.M. WINS ROUND IN SUIT AGAINST VOLKSWAGEN	The General Motors Corporation's espionage case against Volkswagen A.G. will proceed in United States District Court, a Federal judge ruled yesterday. Judge Nancy Edmonds denied a motion by Volkswagen to have the case dismissed. VW had argued that the United States case duplicated a similar lawsuit under way in Germany and that more than 100 witnesses were in Europe. General Motors is accusing VW of espionage, contending that G.M.'s former purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, stole corporate secrets and took them to VW when he switched companies in 1993.
10/17/1996	Progress in G.M. Strike Talks in Canada but No Accord	The chairman of the General Motors Corporation flew to Toronto today and made progress in negotiations to end a two-week strike by Canadian auto workers. But a settlement remained elusive, making it likely that G.M. will temporarily lay off thousands more American workers. John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, met for two hours at a Toronto hotel with Basil E. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Automobile Workers. Mr. Hargrove said afterward that he and Mr. Smith had agreed on broad principles and had set a deadline of noon on Monday for their talks to reach a comprehensive deal.
10/16/1996	G.M.'s Earnings Nearly Doubled In 3d Quarter	The General Motors Corporation reported strong third-quarter profits today, as very low taxes, higher sales and cost controls more than offset a shrinking North American market share. G.M.'s earnings nearly doubled to $1.27 billion, or $1.57 a share, from $642.4 million, or 42 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1995. Sales also rose, to $39.11 billion from $35.32 billion.
10/13/1996	Legions Walk the Line Against General Motors	For General Motors, the nation's biggest company, the labor problems just keep coming. A 17-day strike last March by workers at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, forced G.M. to lay off 176,000 workers temporarily. Now a strike that began on Oct. 2 at several Canadian assembly plants has spread across Canada, with 26,000 workers on picket lines. G.M., which stockpiled Canadian auto parts needed by its American assembly plants, has only furloughed a couple of thousand workers so far. But with talks paralyzed in Canada, the walkout threatens to produce a massive wave of layoffs in the coming weeks. KEITH BRADSHER

Now, after that A- in the history of visual communications -- he nailed an honors grade with a term paper on ''The Brady Bunch'' -- it's time to deliver something really spiffy.

10/12/1996	Impact of Canadian Strike Extends Beyond G.M.	Toyota Corollas that are assembled in North America use a part manufactured at a General Motors factory in Canada that is now on strike, showing the increasing vulnerability of auto makers to labor walkouts as they buy more parts from each other. The General Motors Corporation sent a flat-bed truck with a police escort several times today to a factory in Oshawa, Ontario, to try to remove the die used to stamp seat brackets for the Toyota Motor Corporation cars, said James A. Nimigon, the strike captain at the factory. Mr. Nimigon said that the police had asked him to order the picketers to move aside and let the truck through the factory's north gate, and that he had refused.
10/10/1996	Canada Strike Against G.M. Widens as Two Sides Harden	A week-old strike by Canadian workers of the General Motors Corporation spread further this evening, as the auto maker's chairman signaled that the company would not quickly back down in the dispute. John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said the company needed a labor pact that would let it keep cutting costs, notably by selling two parts factories in Canada. ''We've got certain things that will cripple the company if we don't get fixed right,'' he said at a news conference in the Detroit area this afternoon.
10/10/1996	Progress on a Golf Course	For decades, the Hyatt-Clark Industries factory made steering-wheel parts and ball bearings for its owner, General Motors. But shortly after the factory was bought by its employees, it went bankrupt. The next owner stripped the building to a shell. When the building reverted to G.M. in 1989, the company found it was not profitable to rebuild a factory on the contaminated site straddling Clark and Cranford. So G.M. decided to build a golf course.
10/9/1996	Cadillac hopes its new performance-oriented luxury Catera will revive its languishing image.	CADILLAC and its ad agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, are trying to convince baby boomers who like driving small, performance-oriented German-built luxury sedans that a newfangled Cadillac is really their dream car. While the Cadillac Catera is itself a zippy, German-made luxury car with tight handling, it will be an uphill battle to convince fortysomething buyers that they -- not their parents -- belong in a Cadillac showroom. But Cadillac plans to spend $50 million on advertising in the next three months to convince those buyers to trade in their BMW's, Lexuses and Infinitis for a Catera.
10/7/1996	Strike by G.M. Auto Workers Focuses on Who Wields Power	The General Motors Corporation and the Canadian Automobile Workers union are engaged in a struggle over who really runs the company, which is making it difficult to find a solution to a four-day-old strike. After decades of seeking better wages or benefits, the Canadian union is demanding a labor contract that would restrict many traditional management prerogatives, including the ability to sell factories and shift production to low-wage outside companies. Dean W. Munger, the vice president for personnel at General Motors of Canada and the company's top labor negotiator, said in an interview in Toronto that the company simply could not accept the union's limits on corporate decision-making.
10/5/1996	Canada Strike Could Close G.M.'s Plants In U.S. Shortly	The General Motors Corporation has been quietly stockpiling auto parts in preparation for this week's strike by the Canadian Automobile Workers union, but may still be forced to begin closing factories in the United States by the end of next week if the strike continues, G.M. and union officials said today. Dean W. Munger, G.M. Canada's vice president for personnel, acknowledged today that the company had accumulated some extra parts in preparation for the current walkout in Canada, which began on Wednesday night.
10/4/1996	Talks Sputter as G.M. Strike Ends First Day	Negotiations between the General Motors Corporation and the Canadian Automobile Workers union showed little progress today after 15,000 assembly workers went on strike early this morning. G.M. officials said that they could not accept the same deal that the Canadian union negotiated with the Chrysler Corporation, while the union insisted that it could settle for nothing else. With both sides staking out unusually clear and differing positions, auto industry labor experts said that the compromises needed for a deal could prove elusive.
10/3/1996	Strike Begins as Talks Fail With G.M. of Canada	The General Motors Corporation and the Canadian Automobile Workers union broke off talks and workers walked off the job at G.M. Canada assembly plants late Wednesday night and early this morning in the latest in a series of costly work stoppages for the company. Basil E. Hargrove, the union's president, said in a telephone interview that G.M. had introduced its first comprehensive offer of the negotiations at 9:20 P.M., but that the offer had not addressed any of the union's worries about G.M.'s parts purchases from outside vendors. G.M. negotiators then left the negotiating rooms at the Toronto hotel.
10/2/1996	Chrysler Sets Sales Pace While G.M. Lags	The Chrysler Corporation's cars and trucks continued to outsell the rest of the auto industry while the General Motors Corporation reported another month of lackluster sales today. Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks rose 22 percent in September, while sales at General Motors fell 2.1 percent from the period a year ago. Among the 10 auto makers reporting September results today, sales rose an average 4.9 percent over the period a year ago.
9/30/1996	Talks Yield 3-Year Pact For U.A.W. At Chrysler	The Chrysler Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union concluded a three-year labor contract this evening similar to the union's recent agreement with Ford, leaving General Motors alone without a deal. Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W. president, said the pact reached today followed the same outline as the Sept. 16 Ford contract. ''The pattern has been set'' for the industry, Mr. Yokich said at a news conference.
9/29/1996	Putting More Models in Orbit	IT has taken a long time, but a good idea from 1982 at General Motors -- a plan to start fresh and create a car company that does everything right -- has begun to pay off. The Saturn Corporation has sold 1.27 million vehicles in the United States so far, its dealers are finding buyers for every car it can make, and its customers are displaying a zealous affection far surpassing brand loyalty as it is usually known. Not least in G.M.'s thinking, too, was the creation of a subsidiary that could explore the possibilities, learn and then teach the rest of the organization. Saturn has been doing that, particularly at Oldsmobile. John Rock, general manager of the Olds division, has long been on record as wanting to ''Saturnize'' and to provide an alternative when Saturn drivers decide to move up.
9/29/1996	A Space Module For Planet Earth	WHEN it comes to to skiing, I am a flailer and a stomper. Not really what you'd call smooth on the slopes. And the reason I confess it now is that I've returned from the Camelback ski area near Tannersville, Pa., the place where I first realized my incapacity on the boards, and the visit took me back. This time, though, I was in better control. This time, I was twisting through the ups and downs of Camelback's roads at the wheel of a new Saturn. This time, there was no snow. Much better, I thought. A ski resort can be fun.
9/26/1996	U.S. Auto Makers' Big Cars Give Way to a New Breed	James and Eileen Rawlyk, both 27, looked out of place at Stephens Buick here on a recent afternoon as they waited to pick up a 1997 Park Avenue, Buick's biggest sedan. After all, most shoppers were more than twice their age. Unfortunately for Buick, though, the Rawlyks were not interested in the Park Avenue for themselves: they already have a Volkswagen and a Saturn. They were picking up the spacious Park Avenue for Mr. Rawlyk's parents, and Mr. Rawlyk was quick to point out that he would really rather not have a Buick for himself.
9/24/1996	General Motors Gets Deadline For a Strike By Canadians	The Canadian Automobile Workers union threatened again today to strike General Motors unless G.M. reversed plans to sell factories, the latest in a series of coordinated moves by the Canadian union and the United Automobile Workers union to derail G.M.'s plans to slim down. The Chrysler Corporation reached a three-year contract with the Canadian union on Sept. 17 that bars the company from selling or closing any of its factories in Canada. Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, who is known as Buzz, said today that he would insist that the General Motors Corporation accept a similar contract.
9/21/1996	G.M. Is Ready To Give Up Hughes Unit	General Motors no longer believes that it must control Hughes Electronics to benefit from its technology, although no decision has been made yet to sell the satellite communication, aerospace and auto electronics company, top G.M. and Hughes executives said today. Ever since the General Motors Corporation bought the Hughes Electronics Corporation a decade ago, G.M. has repeatedly said that owning Hughes gave it unlimited access to its laboratories.
9/19/1996	The days of playing in the mud are over for the GMC Jimmy, whose image is being cleaned up.	STARTING Sunday, television viewers will see a fresh approach to selling the GMC Jimmy, a sport utility vehicle designed to attract upscale buyers. For the General Motors Corporation, whose premium truck division, GMC, builds the Jimmy, the latest TV ad is a step away from the tired portrayal of a mud-spattered sport utility vehicle clambering over rocky mountain roads. Instead, it is a reflection of driving realities: The streets of suburbia are the most challenging terrain most of these popular trucks ever face.
9/17/1996	Ford Reaches Tentative Pact With Union	The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union reached agreement this evening on a new national labor contract intended to protect the jobs of current and future union workers, while providing wage increases modestly exceeding the inflation rate. While union and corporate executives refused to discuss the pact's details, Wall Street analysts said the contract would last three years and represented a landmark compromise for Ford's 105,000 U.A.W.-represented workers. Ford guaranteed that the number of U.A.W. workers in its factories would remain at least at 95 percent of the current total, with Ford hiring new workers if necessary to replace retirees, they said.
9/15/1996	A Rival Is Getting New Teeth	WHILE the Dodge Viper GTS assumes the mantle of America's fastest production automobile, whither goest the deposed king? The Corvette ZR-1, a super-performance, limited-production variant of Chevrolet's flagship sports car, was phased out in 1995 after five years as America's No. 1 merchant of menace. Its 415-horsepower multivalve engine, built by Mercury Marine, propelled the ZR-1 to a top speed of 180 miles an hour. The standard-issue Corvettes, driven by the classic 5.7-liter, 330-horsepower V8, attained the humdrum speed of 170 m.p.h.
9/13/1996	U.A.W. Is Just Trying to Hold Its Ground With Detroit	For decades after World War II, the Big Three auto makers' negotiations with the United Automobile Workers were the biggest show in labor relations. The highly ritualized spectacle was watched closely by executives and union leaders in other industries because the U.A.W. had a history of winning big concessions, like automatic cost-of-living adjustments and fully paid health care for retired workers, that soon spread to other businesses. But with the auto makers' current labor contracts set to expire at midnight on Saturday, it is becoming increasingly clear that the U.A.W.'s glory days of big labor breakthroughs are over. Instead of wresting yet more goodies for their members, the union negotiators are fighting a rear-guard action to conserve what they have already gotten and to halt the erosion of the union's membership.
9/13/1996	Buick's new campaign hopes families will feel safe and secure in their full-size LeSabres.	THE rubber hits the road for the new marketing methods of the General Motors Corporation with the introduction of the 1997 models. Those watching for the changes need look no further than the Buick division. After all, 3 of G.M.'s 15 redesigned car and truck lines come from Buick, which has seen sales slip 5 percent so far this year. Buick's six separate campaigns -- one for each 1997 model -- are meant to be emblematic of the companywide overhaul in sales strategies. The McCann-Erickson Detroit unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in Troy, Mich., is the longtime Buick agency.
9/11/1996	G.M. Makes Offer to Union as Ford and Chrysler Continue Talks	The General Motors Corporation made its first comprehensive contract offer to the United Automobile Workers today, as national labor contract negotiations continued at all three Detroit auto makers. While G.M. has been negotiating with the union all summer on a variety of issues, from job security to worker safety, today's proposal was the company's first effort to bring all its different offers into a single package.
9/8/1996	What's New at G.M.? Cars, for a Change	GENERAL MOTORS, once one of America's most successful corporations, developed a reputation in the 1980's as a confused car-making bureaucracy that rolled out one look-alike product after another with little fanfare and modest sales success. Now it is making a big attempt to get back on track. In one of the most ambitious new-car changeovers in a generation, the world's largest auto maker is preparing to introduce 15 all-new models in the next few months, replacing everything from its 14-year-old Buick Century to its Dustbuster-shaped mini-vans. The changes involve 10 assembly plants, 31,000 factory workers and hundreds of suppliers that will produce cars accounting for 40 percent of G.M. sales.
9/6/1996	Auto Talks Are Said to Focus on Parts Compromise	Detroit's Big Three auto makers and the United Automobile Workers union are actively discussing a landmark proposal to resolve their dispute over moves by the manufacturers to buy more auto parts from outside suppliers, people close to the talks said yesterday. The proposal, first made by the manufacturers and pushed particularly by the Ford Motor Company, calls for both sides to make broad concessions that they have resisted in the past, these people said. The auto makers and the U.A.W. are negotiating to replace their current, three-year labor contracts, which expire at midnight on Sept. 14.
9/5/1996	G.M. Says Its Vehicle Sales Slipped 7.9% in August	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales last month dropped 7.9 percent from the strong levels of a year ago, partly because of weak demand for large sedans and luxury cars, and partly because dealers did not have an adequate supply of trucks to sell. Sales of G.M. cars plunged 13.8 percent in August, while sales of the company's mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose a slight 2.1 percent. Of G.M.'s eight divisions, only Chevrolet and Saab, the car maker it owns jointly with Investor A.B., reported higher sales.
9/4/1996	Auto Workers Choose Ford As the Lead Contract Target	The United Automobile Workers union decided today to focus on the Ford Motor Company in national labor negotiations, while continuing talks with General Motors and Chrysler, people close to the negotiations said. The union's goal is to settle as many issues as possible at all three domestic auto makers before the Sept. 14 expiration of the current three-year national contract, two people close to the talks said. The union will try to resolve the industry's toughest problems with Ford and then demand that the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation accept the same terms almost immediately, they said.
9/3/1996	Auto Workers Union Close to Choice for Final Talks	After a week of intense negotiations with General Motors and Ford Motor, the United Automobile Workers union is on the verge of choosing one of them for a final round of talks aimed at producing a national labor contract that the union would try to apply across the industry, union officials said today. The U.A.W. is likely to pick Ford as early as Tuesday unless G.M. improves it contact offer immediately, people close to the union said.
9/1/1996	Still Making 'em Like They Used To	THE good news was that I'd finally found a home for my old 286-chip computer, a monster circa 1986 that was unused but too useful to throw away. The bad news was that I had to take it from Long Island to a buddy in Pennsylvania -- and that had me in a dilemma. I could try to wrestle the thing into the passenger bucket of my new test car, a BMW Z3 roadster (yeah! yeah!), or I could act my sedate age and take the other car, a 1997 Buick LeSabre. Such are my dilemmas these days.
9/1/1996	Warning to Sellers: Let the Buyer Be Aware	NOT that long ago, a buyer who found the right house in the right place at the right price would be satisfied if the plumbing and heating worked, the roof was free of leaks, the basement free of seepage and the beams free of hordes of hungry termites. Now, say real-estate brokers and lawyers, a typical purchaser buying a typical house wants to be fully informed about every condition that could possibly cause a problem in the future. Are the heating pipes insulated with asbestos? Does lead-based paint lie lurking under layers of latex? Is urea formaldehyde foam insulation slowly emitting noxious gas through cracks in the walls?
8/29/1996	Canadian Union To Bargain First With Chrysler	The Canadian Automobile Workers union announced today that it had chosen the Chrysler Corporation as its primary target for labor contract negotiations and a possible strike this autumn, the latest step in a strategy closely coordinated with American auto-union leaders. Basil E. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said in Toronto that he had little choice in selecting Chrysler. The Canadian union has its biggest differences with the General Motors Corporation, but talks with G.M. have shown little progress.
8/27/1996	U.A.W. Said to Prefer Talks With G.M. and Ford First, Chrysler Later	The United Automobile Workers union is leaning toward negotiating a new national labor contract first at the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and leaving the Chrysler Corporation for later, people close to the union said today. While Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, could change his mind, the current consensus at the union is that negotiations should proceed simultaneously with Ford and G.M., people familiar with the union's decision-making said. The three-year labor contracts between the U.A.W. and each of the Big Three auto makers expire at midnight on Sept. 14.
8/23/1996	U.A.W. Delays Picking Target Of Negotiations On Contract	The United Automobile Workers union abruptly postponed plans today to select a Big Three auto maker as the first to face the latest round of labor negotiations, while the union's president demanded meetings with the chief executives of the companies. Stephen P. Yokich, the president of the union, said he had decided to delay a decision on focusing the contract talks solely on one auto maker because preliminary negotiations at all three manufacturers have been going well and he did not want to interrupt them now.
8/16/1996	GENERAL MOTORS DECISION ON PLANT TO BOLSTER EARNINGS	The General Motors Corporation's third-quarter earnings will increase by $250 million because of the company's decision to keep open an assembly plant in Wilmington, Del. G.M. said last week that the plant would build a new midsize Saturn car beginning about 1999. The plant had been scheduled to close, and the company had set aside money for costs related to the shutdown. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week, G.M. said it would remove $250 million from its plant-closing reserve fund and apply it to the bottom line because of the new production plans for Wilmington.
8/11/1996	Have Muscle, Will Travel: 2 New Ways to Play With Power	MY first moments behind the wheel of a 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP were on my frequently traveled route to the video store and dry cleaners. After a long wait at a congested intersection, I spotted a slight opening in the steady stream of cars, punched the gas pedal and quickly made a left turn. The tires squealed wildly for what seemed an eternity. Feeling embarrassed and irresponsible with my two young children in the sedan, I looked around to see if any bystanders had noticed.
8/10/1996	Car Dealer Gets 5 Years for Bilking G.M. of More Than $400 Million	A former Long Island car dealer who admitted bilking the General Motors Corporation out of $422 million in one of the largest frauds in American corporate history was sentenced yesterday to five years in prison. John M. McNamara, 56, had not spent a day in jail since he pleaded guilty in 1992 to swindling G.M. by borrowing billions of dollars from it for nonexistent vans. The delay in sentencing was the result of his agreement to help Federal prosecutors uncover political corruption on Long Island, but his testimony in several bribery cases failed to secure any convictions.
8/7/1996	G.M.'S SATURN DIVISION TO BUILD A LARGER CAR	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would build a midsize Saturn car at its assembly plant in Wilmington, Del., in an effort to broaden the market for the popular brand, which until now has been offered only as a small car. The midsize car will be based on an Opel Vectra model sold in Europe. Production is expected to begin in 1999. The plan to build the new car was approved at a G.M. board meeting on Monday, and it spares the Wilmington plant from what had appeared to be a likely closing.
8/4/1996	Assembly Lines Double as Tourist Attractions	SINCE it opened in 1990, the Saturn auto plant has been a magnet for tourists in the hills of central Tennessee. But until this summer visitors were turned away at the gate. Now, however, the General Motors subsidiary is welcoming tourists inside, letting them see the entire plant from automated trams. Tours of car plants in other states are just as popular. Tourism officials in Kentucky say the Chevrolet Corvette factory in Bowling Green, which offers public tours, is among the state's top attractions.
8/2/1996	G.M. Sales Decline, but Chrysler's Surge	The General Motors Corporation's sales fell by 2.3 percent in July from a year earlier while the Chrysler Corporation's sales surged 18.8 percent, as overall demand for vehicles appeared to cool and shift toward mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks instead of cars. Nearly three-fifths of G.M.'s vehicle sales in the United States come from cars, while two-thirds of Chrysler's sales come from light trucks, which the industry defines as including mini-vans and sport vehicles. So the shift toward light trucks has particularly benefited Chrysler.
7/26/1996	DEMAND FOR SATURNS EXCEEDS PRODUCTION	Saturn could sell about 50,000 more cars a year if it could produce them, the president of the General Motors Corporation's small-car unit said yesterday. While Don Hudler said Saturn continued to make improvements to increase production at its Spring Hill, Tenn., plant, he gave no indication when or if G.M. would foot the bill to expand the plant or build another. An additional 50,000 cars sold would generate more than $600 million in annual revenue. Mr. Hudler also said Saturn was studying a possible expansion of its three-model lineup. His comments came as Saturn showed off its redesigned coupe, the 1997 SC1 and SC2, to Detroit's automotive press. The company sold 285,674 cars last year, about the same as 1994, which amounted to a 10 percent share of the combined small-car and sport coupe segments. The company said sales are up about 4 percent so far this year.
7/24/1996	Auto Workers May Pick G.M. As Target in Contract Talks	Top officials at the United Automobile Workers are having second thoughts about their plans to choose the Chrysler Corporation as the target for labor talks this autumn and are considering the General Motors Corporation instead, people close to the union and G.M. said today. The U.A.W. traditionally seeks a three-year labor contract with one of the Big Three auto makers and then demands that the other two accept essentially the same agreement. The current contracts with G.M., Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company all expire on Sept. 14.
7/20/1996	G.M. to Consolidate Car and Truck Offices	The General Motors Corporation will consolidate the administrative offices of its car and truck divisions at its new headquarters in downtown Detroit over the next five years, officials said today. G.M. announced in May that it was buying the glass-towered Renaissance Center and that it planned to move its headquarters there from its aged landmark, the General Motors Building, north of downtown.
7/18/1996	Pontiac turns back the clock three decades to tout its wide track 1997 Grand Prix.	"PONTIAC is reaching back to an old slogan to promote its redesigned midsized car in a campaign that starts Saturday. In a television spot that will run during the Olympics, Pontiac, a division of the General Motors Corporation, will tout its 1997 """"wide track"""" Grand Prix. The slogan recalls the """"wide track Pontiac"""" rhyme used for nearly a decade starting in 1959."
7/17/1996	G.M.'s Net Declined 16.7% in 2d Quarter	The General Motors Corporation reported a 16.7 percent decline in second-quarter net income because of a one-time $328 million charge indirectly relating to its spinoff last month of the Elecronic Data Systems Corporation. But the profits from continuing operations were better than most Wall Street analysts expected. G.M.'s second-quarter earnings slid to $1.89 billion, or $2.63 a share, from $2.27 billion, or $2.39 a share, a year ago.Sales were $44.77 billion, up 6.1 percent from $42.20 billion a year ago.
7/16/1996	Canada Strike Against G.M. Called 'Likely' By Union Chief	"The president of the Canadian Automobile Workers said today that a strike against the General Motors Corporation in Canada was """"very likely"""" this year and that he planned to bolster the union's strike fund for a protracted showdown. Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove, the union's president, said in an interview today that when negotiations with the company opened on Tuesday, he planned to demand limits on G.M.'s ability to buy more parts from independent suppliers. G.M.'s top executives have vowed not to accept limits on these purchases, known as outsourcing, and as recently as last March endured a crippling 17-day strike at two brake factories in the United States rather than accept such restrictions."
7/16/1996	Ford Offers White-Collar Early Retirement Plans	The Ford Motor Company will offer early retirement packages to white-collar workers in an effort to shed 2,000 employees from its auto operations around the world by the end of the year, helping the auto maker reduce costs and bring in employees with new skills. The early retirement incentives being offered to 4,000 workers are Ford's first in five years for administrators and middle managers. Ford focused on well-paid senior managers and executives in its packages over the last two years.
7/10/1996	Motor Backfiring Prompts Recall by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was recalling 292,860 cars because of a defect that might cause the motors to backfire and in rare cases lead to fires. The recalled cars are some 1996 Pontiac Bonnevilles, Oldsmobile Ninety-Eights, Oldsmobile Eighty-Eights, Buick Park Avenues, Buick LeSabres, Buick Rivieras and Buick Regals, and some 1997 LeSabres that have 3.8-liter engines. All were built before May 1996.
7/9/1996	In Japan, Saturn Signs Car Dealers	"The Saturn division of the General Motors Corporation announced today that it had signed the first six dealers to begin selling its cars in Japan next spring. """"We've been quite frankly pleased with the response from potential retailers,"""" Keith S. Wicks, general director of Saturn Japan, said today after appearing at a news conference with the dealers, who wore white V-neck Saturn sweaters."
7/7/1996	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet 1500 Van Conversion;A Manhattan Apartment on Wheels	"WE were oozing -- no, floating -- down the parkway, vanning to Kennedy International Airport. Hunter, my 2-year-old grandson, was in a safety seat behind me. Jay, my son, was riding shotgun and reminding me of another van, the '67 Ford Econoline that I had bought from a farmer in Pennsylvania a long time ago. """"I won't forget that place,"""" Jay said. """"Remember the goose that jumped on the hood?"
7/6/1996	G.M. in Venture For Saudi Plant	The General Motors Corporation said today that its Delphi Automotive Systems unit had formed a joint venture to build a battery manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia. The plant, which will be G.M.'s first in Saudi Arabia, will be managed by Delphi. The batteries produced will replace the 500,000 currently imported annually from G.M. plants in Korea and the United States.
7/4/1996	Preliminary Approval for Big GM Settlement	A Louisiana judge gave preliminary approval today to a settlement involving $1,000 coupons to resolve lawsuits alleging that some General Motors pickup trucks had potentially dangerous side-mounted gasoline tanks. The coupons would be good only toward the purchase of another GM vehicle, and a plaintiffs' lawyer, Pat Pendley, said he thought that about five million truck owners would qualify for them.
6/30/1996	Correction	A picture caption on June 16 with an article about the closing of the General Motors plant in North Tarrytown was published in error; it referred to a photograph obtained for the article but not published. The nearby location shown was Corona's Luncheonette, not the Catering Deli. The counterman was Pedro Sorie, not Bob Appell. Neasy Corona, not Margaret O'Brien, was seen in the background.

6/28/1996	G.M. to Raise 1997 Vehicle Prices 1.7%	The General Motors Corporation said today that prices for its 1997 model vehicles would rise by only 1.7 percent, on average, putting pressure on its rivals to hold down the prices of their cars and trucks. Auto makers have been struggling in recent months to maintain price increases on mini-vans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and particularly cars as customers have grown increasingly cost-conscious.
6/28/1996	General Motors Reported to Be Studying Consolidation Of Engineering	The General Motors Corporation is quietly preparing a broad shift in how it engineers cars, including the likely development of an immense complex of laboratories and offices to house tens of thousands of engineers now scattered across southern Michigan. Project Dovetail, as the company has code-named the effort, is aimed at reducing the current duplication of effort among the company's seven car divisions and three car engineering centers, people familiar with the project said. The plan is to replace G.M.'s sprawling empire of office buildings and laboratories, accumulated over the last 88 years, with several large office compounds in Michigan, with the main complex housing the engineers.
6/28/1996	Closing After a 96-Year Production Run	After 11 years as an electrician at the old, smoke-stained General Motors plant that rises over the bank of the Hudson River here, Nancy McCague might be expected to be saddened, perhaps even angry, as the plant fades into the history of American manufacturing. The plant, to be closed on Friday, began assembling steam-powered cars in 1900 and has been making Chevys since 1915. And Ms. McCague's father, brother and sister all worked there.
6/27/1996	Auto Plant Closes And Developers See Opportunity;North Tarrytown Focuses On Its Future Instead of the Past	The General Motors Corporation, which owns half of Saab Automobile, announced today that it had obtained an option to buy the other half, and an executive said G.M. was aiming to elevate Saab to a spot alongside its Cadillac division in the worldwide luxury car market. G.M. and Saab's other owner, Investor A.B., the Swedish holding company controlled by the Wallenberg family, agreed to invest $524 million in Saab to pay for the development of new models. At the same time, Investor granted G.M. the option to buy all or part of the Swedish company's stake in Saab in 1999 or 2000. if G.M. does not act, Investor will have the right in 2000 to force G.M. to buy up to half the stake. Terms of the potential sale were not disclosed.
6/25/1996	G.M. Takes Option to Buy Rest of Saab; Sales Push Set	The General Motors Corporation's labor costs for auto parts are $440 higher a vehicle than the Ford Motor Company's costs and $600 higher a vehicle than the Chrysler Corporation's because G.M. buys fewer parts from low-cost outside suppliers, according to a study issued here today. The study, by an independent consulting firm in this northern suburb of Detroit, bolsters G.M.'s position in this summer's labor negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union. G.M. has been seeking extra concessions this year from the U.A.W. to offset the disadvantage the company has from manufacturing so many of its own parts using highly paid union workers.
6/25/1996	G.M.'s Labor Costs for Parts Exceed Rivals', Study Says	With sirens blaring and tires burning, the Police Department's blue and white radio patrol cars have been a staple of television, the movies and the gritty world of real New York City life for 23 years. That is about to change.
6/23/1996	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Taurus G vs. Chevrolet Lumina;Some Cheap Shots In the Price Fight	IT'S not easy being the king of the hill. Just when things are going nicely, some pretender starts taking shots at the throne. Consider, for instance, the embattled reign of the Ford Taurus, the best-selling car in America for the last four years. Soon after an all-new and radically restyled Taurus went on sale last fall, struggling to find buyers amid considerable publicity over Ford's higher sticker prices, Chevrolet reached into its quiver and fired off a few arrows at its longtime rival. Chevy's national ad campaign promoted its midsize Lumina as having several advantages and a $2,000 price edge over the least expensive Taurus, the GL.
6/23/1996	To Buyers, the Spoils of War	A BRAWL has broken out for the title of America's best-selling car, and consumers stand to benefit from some special deals for midsize sedans.
6/19/1996	ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS PLANS TO TAKE A BIGGER CHARGE	The Electronic Data Systems Corporation said yesterday that it would have to set aside more money than earlier projected to pay for a restructuring since its spinoff from the General Motors Corporation. The company said it expected to incur a second-quarter charge totaling $850 million before tax, or $1.12 a share after tax. The company previously thought the charge would total $750 million at most. In addition, E.D.S. said it expected to earn 49 cents to 52 cents a share in the second quarter, before the charge. Analysts have been expecting about 51 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call Inc. Of the $850 million charge, E.D.S. said $277 million would go to severance costs and $513 million would go to write down the value of technology.
6/16/1996	Reality of G.M. Closing for Good Sets In	ALL along Beekman Avenue here there are signs that these are the last days before General Motors shuts its doors for good. The Catering Deli last week delivered the final Saturday lunch order to workers on the weekend shift. Badie Gergis, owner of the Off-Broadway Deli, announced that he would no longer be open 24 hours a day.
6/15/1996	G.M.'s Rocky Labor Ties: Do Rivals Have It Easier?	The Ford Motor Company has not suffered a strike in a decade, while the General Motors Corporation has endured eight strikes in the last three years, including a 17-day walkout in March that cost the company $900 million in after-tax profits. That startling comparison of labor relations was made over and over again here this week as the United Automobile Workers union officially opened negotiations with General Motors, Ford and the Chrysler Corporation. The disparity partly reflects differences in the way that General Motors and Ford handle the union, but is also misleading because G.M. has an inherently more difficult task in its labor relations, auto industry executives, union officials and labor experts said this week.
6/15/1996	VW Allows G.M. Lawsuit To Advance	Volkswagen A.G., the German auto maker, agreed today to receive a United States civil complaint filed by the General Motors Corporation, which has accused VW of industrial espionage and is seeking punitive damages. Though VW, which denies the espionage charges, agreed to accept the complaint under United States jurisdiction, it said it would seek to have the case transferred to a German court. Under legal traditions in Germany, punitive damages are not awarded in civil cases.
6/13/1996	Talks Between G.M. and the U.A.W. Begin on a Sour Note	The president of the United Automobile Workers union accused the General Motors Corporation today of breaking promises and suggested that a top G.M. executive quit, the latest signs that labor negotiations with the company this fall may prove contentious. G.M. has at times taken a hard line toward the union recently, with senior officials saying that factories must become competitive or face sale or closing. The U.A.W.'s three-year labor contracts with G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation will expire on Sept. 14.
6/12/1996	Angered, G.M. Halts Investment in Indonesia	"With American auto makers and the United States Government stepping up pressure on Indonesia to end its policies favoring a local auto maker, a senior executive of the General Motors Corporation said today that his company had suspended plans for further investments there. """"We have put our future investment on hold in that country because we want to get a better understanding of where the Indonesian Government is heading on their policy,"""" said Donald T. Sullivan, the G.M. vice president who oversees the company's Asian and Pacific region operations."

6/11/1996	Negotiations Begin on Auto Industry Pact	"Officials from the United Automobile Workers union and the Ford Motor Company were carrying baseball bats when they showed up here today for the ritual of opening negotiations on a three-year labor contract, but their meeting was cordial and largely ceremonial. Stephen P. Yokich, the president of the U.A.W., and his aides brought two baseball bats given to them by activists who urged them to """"go to bat"""" to stop auto makers from buying more parts from outside companies. Warned how Mr. Yokich had armed himself for the talks, Alexander J. Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, picked up his own bat to show that he could play ball with the union."
6/11/1996	In Naming a New Executive, G.M. Tightens Reins at Saab	The General Motors Corporation took tighter hold of the reins at Saab Automobile A.B. today by naming an executive close to G.M.'s chairman, John F. Smith Jr., to run the Swedish auto maker. Robert W. Hendry, a G.M. vice president and group executive, will become president and chief executive of Saab in August. Saab is a joint venture between General Motors and Investor A.B., the Swedish holding company controlled by the Wallenberg family.
6/10/1996	Life After General Motors: Day 1 at E.D.S.	Electronic Data Systems begins trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange as a separate company, free after a dozen years of ownership by the General Motors Corporation. But E.D.S., the nation's largest independent computer-services provider, has been revving its engine, trying even to line up business from General Motors' rivals, for more than a year. At the company's Virtual Reality Center in Detroit, open since April 1995, E.D.S. has courted executives who had shied away from G.M. Visitors to the center saw how to build and test virtual products in virtual factories, even walking virtual assembly lines to make sure that every employee and robot was productively placed.
6/8/1996	HUGE INVESTMENT PLANNED FOR TRANSMISSION DIVISION	The General MotorsCorporation will invest $275 million in its Allison Transmission division in Indianapolis to modernize its plant and add a new automatic transmission line. The investment will enable Allison to produce transmissions for large-sized pickups. Production will begin in 1999. Allison has traditionally concentrated on automatic transmissions for large heavy-duty trucks, buses and off-highway vehicles. Modernization work at the Indianapolis plant is expected to be completed in 1998.
6/8/1996	E.D.S. Regains Independence From G.M.	Electronic Data Systems, which was sold by Ross Perot to the General Motors Corporation for $2.5 billion in 1984, finally won its independence back from G.M. today. General Motors reported that with a shareholder vote running 60 to 1 in favor, a majority had officially approved the split.
6/6/1996	G.M. Names An Executive For Saab Unit	In a further sign of its eagerness to capitalize on the lessons learned at its Saturn division, the General Motors Corporation is set to appoint another Saturn executive to a ranking position. Joel K. Manby, a regional manager for Saturn in the Midwest, will be named president and chief executive of Saab Cars USA Inc., effective Thursday. The unit is the United States importer and distributor of cars made by Saab Automobile A.B. of Sweden, in which G.M. owns a half- interest. Mr. Manby will replace James P. Crumlish, who has been Saab's top executive in the United States for six years. G.M. said Mr. Crumlish would be assigned to another corporate post.
6/5/1996	Jury's $150 Million Award Against G.M. Touches Off Furor	An Alabama jury has awarded a record $150 million in damages in a case involving apparently faulty door latches on a General Motors vehicle, triggering calls for tort reform as well as an investigation of the auto maker's handling of the issue of the latches over a decade when they were installed in millions of vehicles. The ruling came on Monday in a lawsuit growing out of a 1991 accident in which Alex Hardy, 37, of Lowndes County just west of Montgomery was thrown from his Chevrolet, S-10 Blazer. Mr. Hardy was permanently paralyzed as a result of the accident in which his lawyers maintained, and the jury agreed, that he was ejected some 40 feet when the door latch failed and door flew open.
6/4/1996	Sales Climbed 17% in May For Chrysler	Chrysler and General Motors reported unexpectedly strong sales for May. Chrysler's sales in the United States jumped 17 percent in May to a monthly record, helped by big rebates on cars and a better supply of mini-vans. G.M.'s sales rose 7.2 percent from last May, about double what analysts had expected, on rapid sales of Chevrolet Cavalier cars and Tahoe sport utility vehicles.
6/2/1996	BEHIND THE WHEEL/'97 Ford Escort vs. Chevrolet Cavalier and DodgeNeon; Sizing Up the Small Cars of Detroit's Big Three	"JUST a decade and a half ago, basic transportation too often came in the form of an econobox, those cramped, noisy, underpowered automotive appliances that got from Point A to Point B, and usually made the trip seem longer than it was. And, it is fair to say, Detroit's subcompacts of that era -- remember the Chevy Chevette and the Dodge Omni? -- suffered from unremarkable designs and often shoddy quality. Much has changed in the small-car market. Within the last two and a half years, the Big Three have introduced attractive, well-equipped contenders that are seriously competitive with foreign nameplates. The latest of these American-bred subcompacts -- that's how they are generally classified by the Government, though """"compact"""" might be more descriptive -- are the 1997 Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer. They are going head-to-head with the Dodge/Plymouth Neon, which set new standards for the class when it made its debut in 1994, and the Chevrolet Cavalier, which improved on the Neon with a complete remake for 1995."
5/31/1996	Thailand Adds G.M. to Its List of Auto Makers	The General Motors Corporation, establishing a base from which to tap the booming Asian auto market, formally announced yesterday that it would build a $750 million assembly plant in Thailand, choosing that country over the Philippines. The decision had been expected. Thailand is already a regional auto manufacturing center, with a growing number of plants. The auto industry is considerably less developed in the Philippines, and officials from that country had offered G.M. a bigger package of financial incentives than Thailand did.
5/30/1996	G.M. Expected to Put Plant in Thailand, Not Philippines	The General Motors Corporation will announce on Thursday that it has chosen Thailand over the Philippines as the site for a huge new assembly plant to supply cars for Southeast Asia, people close to the company said today. [In Manila early Thursday morning, Philippine Government officials said they had been told by G.M. that Thailand had won the competition for the plant.]
5/28/1996	G.M. to Tap Asian Market, And 2 Nations Bid for Plant	In Thailand, where the country's bargaining position is strong, the official attitude is studied nonchalance. In the Philippines, where officials are desperate to get into the game, almost anything goes. The game is auto manufacturing in the world's fastest-growing market, and both countries are bidding for a plum: the first full-scale assembly plant to be built in the region by the General Motors Corporation.
5/25/1996	G.M. Locomotive Order	The General Motors Corporation said today that its Electro-Motive division had received an order to supply up to 250 freight-hauling locomotives to English Welsh & Scottish Railway Ltd. Financial terms were not disclosed. The G.M. unit will provide 3,000-horsepower locomotives under the agreement, which requires delivery of 25 to 100 locomotives a year. An Electro-Motive spokesman said initial deliveries would likely begin in 1998. English Welsh & Scottish Railway is owned by the Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporoation of Rosemont, Ill., and American and New Zealand investors.
5/19/1996	Buicks in Rome: That's Amore	FEW who mourn the passing of General Motors' big rear-drive automobiles do so more passionately than Nicola Bulgari, the international jeweler known for his hefty creations in gold and colored stones, who is particularly distressed by the prospect of roads without Roadmasters. Mr. Bulgari's business interests include 40 Bulgari jewelry shops, from Paris to Tokyo to Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. But automobiles, especially Buicks, are his love.
5/19/1996	R.I.P. BUICK ROADMASTER 1936 - 1996	"The Roadmaster first appeared in the 1936 model year, when Buick started using names as well as numbers for all its series. The 1936 catalogue says, with just a touch of hyperbole, """"It literally named itself the first time a test model leveled out on the open highway."""" Originally, the Roadmaster was not the top of Buick's line. The Limited had that honor, but these huge luxo-liners sold in numbers that were limited indeed. When cars came back after World War II, the Limited didn't, leaving the Roadmaster as Buick's flagship. It remained Buick's standard-bearer until 1958, when the Limited returned. When Buick reshuffled all its models for 1959, the Roadmaster name was retired."
5/19/1996	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Buick Roadmaster;A Land Yacht Sails Into the Sunset	THE Buick Roadmaster, for 60 years a symbol of American automotive might, is spending its final days on life support, a victim of shifting demographics. The mammoth Roadmaster Estate Wagon has already passed on, and the sedan is being produced under a death sentence, with the General Motors executioner due to arrive by fall.
5/18/1996	Import Surge Raises Deficit In U.S. Trade	The nation's trade deficit widened in March as imports climbed to a record while the 17-day strike against the General Motors Corporation contributed to a small decline in exports, the Commerce Department reported today. At $8.9 billion, the March gap was somewhat more than most analysts expected, but the figures were muddied by new methodology and mislaid documents that prevented a meaningful month-to-month comparison.
5/17/1996	Market Place;Chrysler Lifts Dividend and Splits Its Stock	The Big Three auto makers, led by the Chrysler Corporation, which announced a stock split and a dividend increase today, are moving to improve returns to shareholders. The moves by Chrysler reflect an industrywide combination of strengthening auto sales this spring, healthier balance sheets and a new willingness to put slightly more emphasis on earning profits instead of winning market share. Responding to the same trends, officials at the General Motors Corporation and, to a lesser extent, the Ford Motor Company have also hinted in recent months at eventually paying out more money to shareholders.
5/17/1996	G.M. Buys A Landmark Of Detroit For Its Home	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had bought the flashiest landmark in Detroit's skyline, the Renaissance Center, and would move its world headquarters to the downtown complex of five shiny glass towers. The purchase means that the city synonymous with the automobile industry will soon house the world's largest auto company in the building shown on Motor City postcards. The move from G.M.'s 15-story building near a highway to the 73-story Renaissance Center in the heart of downtown will make true the old phrase: on a clear day, you can see General Motors.
5/16/1996	SHARES OF ANALOGY FALL AFTER PURCHASES POSTPONED	Shares of Analogy Inc. fell 34 percent yesterday after an analyst said that the General Motors Corporation, one of its largest clients, had postponed purchases from the software developer indefinitely. John Barr, an analyst at Needham & Company, also said he had lowered his fiscal 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates for Analogy, of Beaverton, Ore. Analogy shares fell $4.50, to $8.75.
5/15/1996	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;General Motors retools its corporate advertising to promote itself as a brand worth sticking with.	WHO would have thought that advertising for the General Motors Corporation would one day echo an anthem for hippies? That improbable occurrence is a highlight of an ambitious campaign that seeks to burnish G.M.'s corporate image as the auto maker promotes individual car, truck and mini-van models. The campaign comes as the company overhauls sales strategies to try recapturing market share in North America.
5/14/1996	Next Wave of Electric Cars: Hybrids	A motley collection of electric and hybrid vehicles will buzz, whirr and hum their way over 64 miles from Chesapeake to Annapolis in Maryland on Tuesday, about 50 in all, depending on how many have run out of juice, shorted out a component or otherwise broken down along the way in the eighth American Tour de Sol race, which began in New York City and will end here on Thursday. The cars in the race are better than they ever have been. For many of the vehicles, the minimum demand of the race, up to 71.4 miles a day over a mixed city, suburban and interstate route, is hardly a challenge. The leading entry hopes to go 300 miles on a single charge, farther than many conventional cars go on a tank of gas.
5/14/1996	VW Planning Countersuit Against G.M.	Volkswagen A.G. said today that it would file a defamation suit against the General Motors Corporation and its subsidiary Adam Opel A.G., which have accused VW of stealing trade secrets. VW will seek at least 10 million marks -- about $6.6 million -- in the suit, which accuses G.M. of violating German law against unfair competition. The law also forbids defamatory accusations. The companies have been at odds since 1992, when G.M.'s chief of purchasing, Jose Ignacio Lopez Arriortua, defected to Volkswagen and took several managers with him. G.M. and Opel accused Mr. Lopez of taking trade secrets.
5/12/1996	A Big Hulk Has Become the Latest Status Symbol	"AS parents and au pairs drive up to collect children at the private San Domenico School in San Anselmo, Calif., it seems that every second vehicle is a nine-passenger land yacht named the Suburban. """"Everyone has one,"""" said Amy Weaver, an interior decorator who carpools with two other mothers, all of whom drive different-colored Suburbans. """"I'm Big Blue. My business partner is Big Green and the other one is Big Turquoise."
5/9/1996	Competition May Thin Profits In Sport Utilities	From pint-sized Jeep Wranglers to Chevrolet Suburbans the size of a garage, sport utility vehicles have been the mainstay of profits at Detroit's Big Three auto makers since the late 1980's. But now a small traffic jam of new models is emerging in the market, and auto executives predict that the profits, while still enormous, will start to erode. The Ford Motor Company plans to display its largest offering, the three-bench, nine-passenger Ford Expedition, at its annual meeting in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday. In the last four months, Toyota has introduced the small RAV 4 sport utility and the Lexus LX 450, Nissan has completely redesigned its Pathfinder and Chrysler has come out with a new Jeep Wrangler.
5/7/1996	G.M. Decides on Site For Plant in Poland	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it planned to invest 500 million marks ($329 million) to build a car factory in Gliwice in southwestern Poland. G.M. had said in December that it intended to invest in such a plant but did not provide information then about where the plant would be. Construction of the factory is to begin this year, and G.M. officials said they expected the first car to be produced at the end of 1998. The plant will be able to produce 70,000 cars a year initially and will employ 2,000 workers. The new plant will complement G.M.'s existing Warsaw factory, which produces Opel Astra cars. (AP)
5/4/1996	Detroit's Sales Pace Slowed in April, With Ford Off 2%	In the auto business, April was a lamb to March's lion. Car and truck sales last month dropped to an annual pace of 14.6 million, seasonally adjusted, down from a sizzling 15.9 million in March. The April slowdown reflected surprisingly weak sales at the Ford Motor Company along with shortages of some General Motors autos, which were slow getting to dealers because of a 17-day strike in March.
5/2/1996	Strong Auto Sales Point to Rising Confidence	Despite rising gasoline prices, two of the biggest auto makers reported strong April sales today that exceeded analysts' expectations, providing another sign that consumers' confidence is growing. The General Motors Corporation said its sales rose 7.7 percent last month, compared with April 1995, despite a recent strike that crimped the production of some of its hottest sellers.
5/2/1996	G.M. Plans to Close Parts Factory in Ireland	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would close a money-losing parts plant in Ireland in July and cut 509 jobs.
5/1/1996	What do Chevrolet, Conde Nast and Macy's have in common? A customer base of young women.	FOR decades, the Detroit auto makers marketed to women about as successfully as Ford sold Edsels or Cadillac sold Cimarrons. All that has changed, however, as the Big Three belatedly recognized how much power women wielded in the purchasing process and how ardently women were being wooed by Japanese car companies. An example of that seminal shift is an ambitious cross-promotional program linking the Chevrolet division of the General Motors Corporation with a leading retailer, the Macy's East unit of Federated Department Stores, and women's magazines owned by the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications.
4/24/1996	Invalid G.M. Shares Re-emerge in Europe	A batch of invalidated General Motors stock certificates, which were supposed to have been destroyed four years ago, have emerged again in Europe. The Securities and Exchange Commission notified stock exchanges worldwide last week to be on the lookout for some 1.3 million canceled certificates of common and preferred stock with an estimated market value of about $7 billion.
4/23/1996	Hurt by Strike, G.M.'s Profits Are Off by Half	The General Motors Corporation said today that its earnings dropped by half in the first quarter, dragged down mostly by the 17-day brake-factory strike last month in Dayton, Ohio, that cost the company $900 million in after-tax profits. Even without the strike, earnings from selling cars and car parts in North America fell slightly, in part because the first quarter of 1995 had been an unusually busy period for the auto industry.
4/21/1996	New Blood for the Big Three's Plants	"JUST over a year ago, Tammy M. Nedzweckas quit her $10,000-a-year job as a restaurant cook and started working the night shift at a Ford Motor Company plant here, earning $31,000 a year. Every minute and 15 seconds, she twists an air-conditioning valve cap on a Bronco or a pickup, slams the hood shut and clambers up behind the wheel to drive the truck around the corner. Then she hurries back on foot to tighten the next cap. Almost overnight, Ms. Nedzweckas (pronounced nez-WES-cus) escaped the clutch of poverty-level wages and grabbed a piece of the American Dream: a better life for her two children. """"I can afford to have my own house -- I can afford to have a reliable car,"""" she exults. When her daughter was born last year, she collected five months of paid maternity leave."
4/17/1996	Wildcat Walkout Is Ended At Big G.M. Assembly Plant	Striking workers returned to their jobs at a General Motors Corporation assembly plant tonight hours after G.M. once again displayed its aggressive new approach to labor relations, obtaining a Federal court order for an immediate end to the wildcat strike. It was unclear how much effect the temporary restraining order from the Federal District Court in Cleveland had in ending the strike. Jim Tripp, the financial secretary of the United Automobile Workers union local in Lordstown, Ohio, said in an interview before the court order was issued that the union wanted a quick end to the strike.
4/17/1996	G.M. Strike Drags Down Industrial Output	Weighed down by a 17-day strike at the General Motors Corporation, industrial output slumped five-tenths of 1 percent in March to match the biggest declines since the final stages of the 1990-91 recession, the Federal Reserve reported today. But excluding the lost output of vehicles and parts, production climbed three-tenths of 1 percent to support the growing consensus that the economic boiler has picked up steam but is no danger of overheating.
4/16/1996	Wildcat Strike Shuts Down a G.M. Plant	A wildcat strike shut down a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, today that makes some of the General Motors Corporation's most popular cars, the latest sign of continued labor problems at the world's largest auto maker. While there were several signs that the strike could prove brief, the work stoppage was another sign of the deep discontent on the floors of several large G.M. factories. That discontent could make it more difficult for the national leaders of the United Automobile Workers union to work out a compromise this summer with G.M.'s top management before the U.A.W.'s national contract with the Big Three auto makers expires on Sept. 14.
4/14/1996	As Full-Size Cars Vanish, Police Pay	The full-size police cruiser, like the old-fashioned family station wagon, is becoming a thing of the past, and many police departments say the change in automotive tastes is costing them money. The shift in the police car market began earlier this year when General Motors, citing shrinking demand for its Chevrolet Caprice, announced plans to end production of the 4,000-pound car, leaving the market to Ford's equally hefty rear-wheel-drive Crown Victoria.
4/12/1996	DELPHI PLANS TO SELL 3 PLANTS AND SHUT ONE	The General Motors Corporation's parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, said yesterday that it would sell three North American plants and close a fourth in an effort to become more profitable. Delphi plans to sell its electrical and lighting plants in Livonia, Mich.; and Oshawa and Windsor, Ontario, and close a generator plant in Albany, Ga., that employs about 500 workers. They will be offered transfers to another plant in Flint, Mich., that will take over the Albany plant's work, Delphi said. Delphi also said it would seek a partner for a plant in Flint. The company has said that it plans to increase its business outside North America, and with customers other than General Motors. On Tuesday, Delphi Packard Electric Systems said it would build a $17 million plant and service center in Guangzhou, China, to make automotive electronics for export to Europe and for Chinese car makers.
4/9/1996	Honda to Offer An Electric Car	The Honda Motor Company said yesterday that it would introduce a two-seat electric car in California in the spring of 1997. The declaration makes Honda the second auto maker with plans to offer a specially made electric car. The General Motors Corporation plans to begin selling and leasing its EV-1 model in Arizona and California this fall.
4/4/1996	Domestic Sales Rose 4.3% For Auto Makers in March	Domestic sales of cars and light trucks rose a combined 4.3 percent last month, the final figures from the auto makers showed today, giving a strong start to the important spring selling season. The industry's overall performance was bolstered by sharp gains by Toyota and Honda and came despite the dampening effects of a 17-day strike that squelched production at General Motors.
4/2/1996	Split of Electronic Data and G.M. Is Set	For E.D.S., life after its long-sought parting from General Motors might not be so sweet after all. The companies announced yesterday that Electronic Data Systems, the world's largest computer services provider, would pay the world's largest car maker $500 million for its freedom and face rival bidders for billions of dollars of G.M. contracts that now are captive. Beginning next year, E.D.S. will even have to offer easier payment terms to G.M.
4/2/1996	G.M.'s Monthly Sales Drop While Chrysler's Increase	The General Motors Corporation announced today that its March sales dropped 2.2 percent from levels a year earlier because a long strike interrupted its production. But the Chrysler Corporation reported an 8.1 percent gain for the month. One reason G.M. car sales declined, according to Ed Lechtzin, a company spokesman, was that it delayed until April the delivery of some cars to fleet buyers in order to conserve its scarce supply of cars for retail buyers during the 17-day strike. The work stoppage involved two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, that led to a gradual closing of most of the company's North American assembly plants and some shortages of cars on dealer lots.
3/29/1996	New Jobless Claims Surge, but Strike is Cited	The number of new claims for jobless benefits surged by 43,000 last week to the highest level in nearly four years, lifted by applications from workers affected by the General Motors Corporation strike, which has been settled. The Labor Department said today that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 429,000, up from 386,000 in the week ended March 16 and the highest since July 25, 1992.
3/25/1996	Market Place;G.M. has begun telling analysts it can't offset lost production.	AS the General Motors Corporation struggles to reopen its assembly plants after a 17-day brake-factory strike, the bad news for the company, for its shareholders and for the American economy is that much of the lost weeks of production may never be made up. And that disrupts G.M.'s planning for the third quarter, when it will shut many plants as it prepares to introduce many new models, its most ambitious retooling in years. G.M. had built up unusually large inventories over the winter, anticipating limited production in the third quarter. But now a large chunk of that inventory is being sold and could be hard to replace.
3/25/1996	Ryder Says Strike Will Hurt	Ryder System Inc. says that it expects first-quarter earnings to fall short of Wall Street estimates, primarily because of the strike at the General Motors Corporation, its largest customer. Ryder, a provider of logistics and transportation services, said on Friday that the strike against G.M. by the United Automobile Workers union, which was settled on Thursday, hurt its Ryder Automotive Carrier Group unit, which ships more than half of G.M.'s North American production.
3/24/1996	A Modest Strike;For the U.A.W., It's Not the Revolution	"AT first glance, the basic relationship between labor and capital in the United States seemed to be changing last week. A small band of workers, just 3,000 brake makers here, had shut down the world's largest auto maker, the General Motors Corporation, in the industry's biggest work stoppage since 1970. Some outsiders called for the United Automobile Workers to rally Americans under a banner of resistance to the broad forces of economic change that have produced so much insecurity across the country. And Robert Eaton, the chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, lamented, """"Today, apparently the shame is raising a son who grows up to be a C.E.O."
3/24/1996	Dress Rehearsal For G.M. Closing	THREE decades and what seems like a lifetime ago, Otto Rivera, a lanky youth from the Bronx, drove to his first day of work here in a sporty, light blue 1963 Chevrolet Bel Aire. Since those first years working on the assembly line at General Motors, there have been promotions, a wife and family, a home in the suburbs and a series of newer model cars. Life was everything Mr. Rivera had hoped for, until his 47th birthday this year. Now the shop chairman for the United Automobile Workers is facing unemployment because the automaker will close the plant once the current model year ends this summer. The shutdown is part of an accelerated consolidation and idling of 22 selected factories in the United States and Canada. So far, 13 plants have been closed or sold.
3/23/1996	SHOWDOWN AT G.M. LEAVES BIG ISSUES STILL UNRESOLVED	Workers began returning to two General Motors brake factories this afternoon, ending their 17-day strike with local disputes resolved but not critical national issues between the company and the United Automobile Workers. The national issues are sure to come up again this summer when negotiations begin before the expiration on Sept. 14 of the U.A.W.'s three-year national contract. But for now, both sides have paid a stiff price for a strike that paid off mostly for the local workers. G.M. lost considerable production, and by the end of the strike, 177,775 U.A.W. members were laid off.
3/23/1996	The General Motors Strike	"Although the 18-day strike at two General Motors plants in Dayton, Ohio, ended Friday, the issues that provoked it will resurface this summer when the time comes for the United Automobile Workers to renegotiate its contracts with the Big Three auto makers. The practice of """"outsourcing,"""" which allows a manufacturer to buy component parts from outside contractors, is seen by the U.A.W. as a grave threat to its members. By buying from companies that pay lower wages, either in the United States or abroad, a manufacturer can save millions. G.M. makes more of its own parts than either Ford or Chrysler, but it believes that increased outsourcing is vital to its competitiveness. Big employers like G.M. feel that to be competitive they need to cut their staffs to the bare bones. When demand goes up, it is cheaper to require overtime from a leaner work force than to add employees. When even overtime will not keep up with demand, the manufacturers want to be able to turn to outside suppliers."
3/22/1996	Bad Weather Is Blamed for Inventory Rise	Business inventories jumped in January, the Commerce Department said today, but analysts said the surge reflected special factors and not a weakening economy. They similarly dismissed an increase in jobless claims. Inventories rose six-tenths of 1 percent, the largest increase since a seven-tenths of 1 percent surge last October. At the same time, the Labor Department said that jobless claims shot up by 32,000 last week to the highest level in two months.
3/22/1996	GENERAL MOTORS AND UNION AGREE TO END WALKOUT	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union agreed today to end the biggest auto industry shutdown in a generation, a 16-day strike at two brake factories here that virtually halted G.M.'s operations across North America and caused the layoff of hundreds of thousands of workers. The tentative agreement, which must be approved by striking workers here, calls for some additional hiring at the brake factories, up to several hundred jobs over the next two years if the operations here hold down costs, a person close to the negotiations said. The pact also contains a few new features allowing G.M. to continue buying some brakes and brake parts from independent, nonunion outside suppliers. This hotly contested practice, known as outsourcing, led to the strike which began here March 5.
3/22/1996	New Jersey Daily Briefing;Fast Return to G.M. Unlikely	Even though General Motors Corporation and the United Auto Workers Union reached a tentative agreement yesterday to end a strike at two brake-manufacturing plants in Dayton, Ohio, G.M. officials said it could take more than a week before idled workers in New Jersey return to work. [Page A1] Ripple effects from the strike have been felt at a General Motor's assembly line in Linden, which shut down March 11, putting 2,100 people out of work. An additional 800 employees, at the Delphi Interior and Lighting Systems plant in Ewing Township, have been off the job since March 15.
3/21/1996	G.M. Strikers Fear Threat To Way of Life	The rest of the world knows the nation's largest auto maker as the General Motors Corporation, but residents of this quiet southeastern Ohio city have their own name: Generous Motors. The nickname reflects a mixture of awe and envy at the wages and benefits that G.M. provides to its workers here. The 3,200 brake factory workers who have been on strike for 15 days are mostly high school graduates who lately have earned an average of $69,000 a year by working six- and seven-day weeks.
3/20/1996	Striking Out	The United Automobile Workers has drawn a line in the sand and struck at General Motors' two brake-production plants in Dayton. But G.M.'s hard-line decision to let the job action shut its entire manufacturing process, while negotiations drag on, demonstrates that if the U.A.W. decides to do nothing but  strike, its efforts will be futile. The issue is outsourcing -- G.M.'s right to buy parts from outside suppliers  for its car and truck assembly plants. If G.M. gets its way, it will buy even more parts from a growing set of low-wage, nonunion supplier companies, just as  Ford, Chrysler and American-built Honda do. The U.A.W. is fighting to keep these jobs in the high-wage, high-benefit G.M. system.
3/20/1996	Negotiations to End Strike Against G.M. Falter	Progress faltered today in negotiations between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers to settle a two-week-old strike at brake factories here, and G.M. laid off more workers. A 40-hour negotiating session ended early this morning without a deal, and the participants took a break before resuming the talks at noon. G.M. and U.A.W. officials were discouraged by the failure to reach a deal, people close to each side said.
3/19/1996	G.M. Considers Executive to Manage Learning	"Seeking to better harness the knowledge of its employees worldwide, the General Motors Corporation will likely appoint a senior-level chief learning officer to coordinate the spread of information around the company's vast holdings, a executive said in a speech late Sunday. Harry J. Pearce, vice chairman and an executive vice president of the giant auto maker, also said that General Motors might add a foreign-born director to its board in an attempt to gain perspective on world markets. """"We have been looking worldwide for appropriate candidates for the past year,"""" Mr. Pearce said at a meeting of the America-Israel Chamber of Commerce of Michigan in Troy."
3/19/1996	G.M. Strike May Be Worst Blow For the Midwest Since '93 Floods	Government and private economists said today that the 13-day-old strike at two General Motors brake factories here has delivered the worst blow to the Midwest economy since the floods of 1993. The strike has already reduced the nation's production of goods and services by $5 billion to $7 billion, wiping out a third of the already-weak economic growth in the first quarter, several economic research firms said today.
3/18/1996	Talks at Striking G.M. Brake Plant Take Optimistic Turn	"Negotiators from the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers made progress this weekend toward settling a 12-day strike at a brake factory here that has virtually shut down the North American car and truck operations of the world's largest auto maker. Participants in the talks were cheerful about the prospects for a deal, although they declined to discuss details. One participant said there was now """"a little more conciliatory atmosphere."

3/17/1996	Cost-Cutting Strategy	For many years, the General Motors Corporation has been giving in to strikes at critical parts factories while hiring almost no new workers, so that its work force has gradually aged and begun retiring. As these older workers have left, and some have been laid off during recessions, G.M. has been able to buy more and more of its parts from low-cost outside companies that are often not unionized. The result, as one auto industry veteran noted this week, is that G.M. has lost every strike for a decade while still managing to shrink its payroll by more than 100,000 jobs.
3/16/1996	Union Lays Out Demands in G.M. Strike	"Strikers at a brake factory here want safer equipment, more training, more hiring and an end to moves by the General Motors Corporation to buy more parts from outside companies, local union officials here said shortly before the two sides agreed to stop discussing their differences in public. Joe Buckley, chairman of the bargaining committee for the United Automobile Workers Local 696, and Jerry Domi, the local's negotiator on G.M.'s outside purchases, laid out the strikers' demands in interviews on Thursday. Mr. Buckley said that the union was insisting that all of its concerns be addressed. """"All of the issues are of equal importance to us,"""" he said."
3/16/1996	Administration Calls for End To G.M. Strike	The Clinton Administration called on the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers today to settle a 10-day strike that has virtually shut down the North American operations of the world's largest auto maker. The call came hours after negotiations here appeared to show the first signs of progress. The strike at two brake factories here has forced G.M. to close 24 of its 29 assembly plants and dozens of parts factories across North America. The company announced the layoffs today of another 13,350 auto parts workers, bringing the number of idled G.M. workers to 124,700, plus another 7,300 Saturn workers who were receiving training while their factory is closed.
3/15/1996	Across Nation, Scores of Workers Affected	The General Motors Corporation and its outside suppliers have laid off tens of thousands of automobile parts workers across North America as a nine-day-old brake-factory strike here continues to cripple the world's largest auto maker. G.M. announced today that it had temporarily laid off 47,900 parts workers this week, in addition to the 70,750 assembly plant workers idled by the strike so far. A shortage of brakes has forced G.M. to close 24 of its 29 assembly plants in North America, including a mini-van factory in North Tarrytown, N.Y., that shut down today and laid off 2,000 workers.
3/15/1996	G.M. Strike Closes Plant In Tarrytown	Ripples from the distant General Motors strike in Ohio finally reached here today when the company shut down its gargantuan assembly plant looming over the Hudson River. But given the uncommon predicament of the 2,000 workers, the shutdown was as much insult as injury. Workers at the plant, which has been here for eight decades and now assembles Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac mini-vans, have known for more than three years that it will shut down for good on June 28. In that time they have been bracing for a tumultuous change in their lives.
3/14/1996	For G.M. Pickets, Coffee and Concern	After several days of golf and household chores, George Heeter, Jack Dyer and Bob Coulder showed up today at a General Motors brake factory here to take their turns carrying picket signs and to marvel at their ability to cripple the world's largest auto maker. In just eight days, a strike by these three men and close to 3,200 other workers at two factories here has caused the General Motors Corporation to run out of brakes for most of its models. The company has closed 22 of its 29 assembly plants in North America and 44 parts factories, idling 84,000 workers. Negotiations to settle the strike, a dispute over G.M.'s outside contracting and long work hours here, produced no substantive progress today.
3/14/1996	A POISON PILL IS ADOPTED PRIOR TO A SPINOFF BY G.M.	Electronic Data Systems said yesterday that it had adopted a poison-pill takeover defense as the General Motors Corporation prepares to spin off the company. The strategy would make it prohibitively expensive for an unwanted suitor to buy E.D.S., as the company, which provides computer services, is known. E.D.S. said the plan was not adopted in response to any known takeover threat.
3/13/1996	New Jersey Daily Briefing;Ohio Strike Shuts G.M. Plant	A United Auto Workers strike at two General Motors Corporation brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, forced the shutdown of G.M.'s assembly line in Linden yesterday, putting 2,100 union members out of work for the duration of the walkout.
3/13/1996	Corrections	A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about the relationship between Saab Automobile A.B. and the General Motors Corporation misidentified a car. It was a Chevrolet Lumina, not a Chevrolet Corsica.
3/13/1996	75% of G.M. Plants Are Idle As Strike Enters a 2d Week	A week-old strike at critical parts-making factories has led to the closing of nearly three-quarters of General Motors' assembly plants in North America, with some 83,000 G.M. workers idled today. What began last Tuesday as a strike by the United Automobile Workers union at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, has turned into a much broader struggle between the world's largest auto maker and its union. At issue is the extent to which G.M. will continue to make its own parts or buy them from other companies, which in many cases are not unionized.
3/12/1996	Strike's Effect Widely Felt In Auto Plants	The effects of a week-old brake-factory strike rippled across North America today, with the General Motors Corporation's closing of 14 assembly plants and 16 parts plants from Chihuahua, Mexico, to Oshawa, Canada. Today's layoffs turned the strike into the largest auto industry work stoppage in recent years, surpassing a 1992 strike at a G.M. parts factory in Lordstown, Ohio, that idled 43,000 workers at nine assembly plants.
3/10/1996	What's the Buzz? G.M.'s Electric Car Is Headed to Showrooms	"ELECTRIC cars produced by a brand-name auto company, complete with warranty and dealer service, are just a few months away. But the EV1, the two-seater from the General Motors Corporation, will cost roughly $35,000, almost as much as a Corvette and a little more than two Saturns. At that price, who is going to want one? Probably not someone who is comparing it to the Corvette or the Saturns, according to G.M.'s Saturn division, which will sell them. There is no car to compare it to, contended John J. Orth, director of consumer marketing at Saturn. """"It's just a totally new category,"""" he said."
3/10/1996	New Union Tactics	A five-day-old strike by 3,200 brake parts workers in Dayton, Ohio, has shut down a third of the General Motors Corporation North American assembly lines. Yet 300 of those workers are crossing picket lines with their union's approval to make brake parts at the same factories for the Chrysler Corporation and a Japanese auto maker. The union's decisions illustrate fundamental changes in the global auto industry and in the United Automobile Workers, which ordered the Dayton strike. Auto executives and union officials alike say that the current negotiations to end the Dayton strike are a preview of the issues that will come up in September, when the union's national contract expires with General Motors, Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company.
3/9/1996	G.M. Files a Lawsuit Against VW and Some Executives	Still angry about the defection of eight managers to Volkswagen A. G. three years ago, the General Motors Corporation announced today that it had filed a civil complaint against Volkswagen, four Volkswagen executives and the former G.M. executives for the theft of company secrets. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court here late Thursday, accused Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and seven other former G.M. purchasing managers of stealing more than 20 cartons of confidential G.M. documents when they went to Volkswagen. The lawsuit accused Volkswagen and four of its executives of conspiring in the purported theft, using the documents to gain a commercial advantage and then shredding them.
3/8/1996	Strike at a G.M. Parts Plant Is Affecting Much of Company	General AMotors assembly plants began running out of brakes and shutting down today, as a three-day strike at two brake parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, threatened to cripple car and truck production from the world's largest auto maker. The General Motors Corporation said its factories in Wilmington, Del., Orion Township, Mich., and Oshawa, Ontario, ran out of parts to install in new vehicles today and closed down, idling a total of 12,100 workers who had been making the Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac cars.
3/6/1996	Automobile Workers Strike, Shutting 2 G.M. Parts Plants	Almost 3,200 members of the United Automobile Workers went on strike today, shutting down two General Motors factories that make brake parts in Dayton, Ohio. The work stoppage threatened to force the closing of other factories that need the parts. The strike was prompted by the General Motors Corporation's plans to buy certain parts from outside companies. Local 696 of the auto workers union has been negotiating for nearly a month with G.M. about these plans. The talks broke off this morning but are scheduled to resume on Wednesday morning.
3/2/1996	Vehicle Sales Unexpectedly Strong Last Month	Most auto makers reported strong February sales today, an early indication that the economy may be shrugging off a slow fourth quarter of 1995 and the effects of January's snowstorms. The General Motors Corporation said sales of its cars and light trucks rose to 399,383 last month, up an unexpectedly large 5 percent from February 1995. The Chrysler Corporation sold 207,839 cars and trucks last month, 20 percent above the previous February.
2/23/1996	BUICK NAMES BRAND MANAGER FROM KEEBLER	The General Motors Corporation's Buick division said yesterday that it had appointed Roger Adams, an executive at the Keebler Company, to be brand manager for the Buick Regal. G.M., which is seeking to sharpen the image of individual vehicles, has hired 34 brand managers since the fall, including five consumer marketers from outside the company. Analysts have criticized G.M.'s marketing as being unfocused, causing its car and truck divisions to compete for the same customers. The brand managers oversee vehicle marketing strategy, including advertising and pricing. Mr. Adams, 39, most recently was Keebler's vice president for marketing and research and development, responsible for the cookie and cracker divisions. United Biscuits P.L.C. sold Keebler's cookie unit last month to Inflo Holdings for $487.5 million. The Regal was Buick's second-best selling model last year, behind the Le Sabre.
2/23/1996	Dealer Who Bilked G.M. Takes Stand in Bribery Trial	Nearly four years ago, as the sheriff was knocking at the door of his Long Island car dealership, John McNamara was frantically feeding documents into a paper shredder -- hoping, he later admitted, to destroy evidence of how he had swindled the General Motors Corporation out of $6.2 billion in loans for nonexistent vans. Federal investigators, however, were quick to pick up what remained of the paper trail, which led far beyond Mr. McNamara's Buick-Pontiac showroom in Port Jefferson Station, L.I., to one of the largest frauds in American history.
2/21/1996	GMC and Pontiac: One Division, 2 Images	With the merger of its Pontiac and GMC divisions, the General Motors Corporation has sent a clear signal of a strategy it plans to pursue in the years to come: keep well-known brand names alive, while seeking savings in areas that customers are less likely to notice. As expected, G.M., the largest auto maker in the world, announced today that it was combining the staffs and dealer networks of Pontiac and GMC into a single division. But the new division will continue to sell cars with the Pontiac name and trucks with the GMC name, and it will maintain separate advertising agencies and campaigns.
2/20/1996	G.M. to Merge GMC Division With Pontiac	The General Motors Corporation plans to announce on Tuesday the merger of its Pontiac and GMC divisions, a sign that G.M. management is moving to consolidate the conflicting brands and corporate fiefs that have hampered the auto maker for decades. General Motors will announce that it is combining the staffs and dealer networks of the two divisions into a single marketing unit headed by Roy S. Roberts, now the general manager of the highly successful GMC truck division, company officials said today.
2/13/1996	General Motors plans to redesign its Epcot Center exhibit as part of a bigger brand campaign.	THE General Motors Corporation plans to replace its exhibit at the Epcot Center attraction at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., as part of an ambitious revamping of its car and truck advertising and marketing by emphasizing brands. General Motors is scheduled to discuss its plans today at the exhibit, known as the World of Motion. The exhibit was one of the original corporate-sponsored pavilions when the Walt Disney Company opened Epcot in 1982.
2/13/1996	CHRONICLE	TOM SELLECK, the actor best known as Magnum, P.I., is taking on a new role. With his father and two brothers, he is planning to demolish an old General Motors plant in the San Fernando Valley that closed in 1992 and build a $100 million shopping complex. Their goal, The Associated Press reported yesterday, is to transform the site, in a crime-ridden neighborhood of Van Nuys, Calif., into a bustling center with stores, theaters, restaurants and industrial space.
2/6/1996	G.M., Sharing Some Profit, Lifts Dividend	Deciding to share more of its record profits with shareholders, directors of the General Motors Corporation today raised the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock by a third to 40 cents. Wall Street analysts had been expecting a dividend increase and said that the company could afford the additional $300 million annual outlay.
2/4/1996	Betamax Redux: Big 3 Brawl on Electric Cars	THE Detroit auto makers will soon be selling electric cars in California, and Ford, Chrysler and General Motors say they want a common standard for how the cars plug in for recharging, just as their gasoline-powered cars have standard-sized filler pipes that accept standardized gasoline nozzles. But an old-fashioned rivalry threatens to complicate the market even as it struggles to be born. General Motors, which has the most experience of the three with electric vehicles, designed its EV1 -- formerly known as the Impact -- with an inductive charger, which transmits energy in the form of an alternating magnetic current. The current comes out of a paddle that looks as if it came from a Ping-Pong table. The driver slips the paddle into a slot on the front of the car.
2/2/1996	U.S. Auto Makers Fear Strength Of Dollar Gives Edge to Japan	With rebates spreading and profits threatened, the nation's car makers are now complaining about the strength of the dollar. When the dollar was falling and the Japanese yen was rising, Japan's auto makers were raising prices regularly and handing the Big Three auto makers the best import-fighter ever: a price advantage. But now Japanese auto makers are skipping some price increases thanks to a round of significant cost-cutting, and the price difference between Japanese and American cars and trucks is shrinking.
1/31/1996	G.M. Reports Surging Profits, Partly Because Of Tax Gains	The General Motors Corporation's core business suffered several reversals late last year, but nimble work by the company's tax accountants sent its net income soaring in the fourth quarter. G.M., the nation's biggest auto maker, reported today that strong sales of lower-profit small cars, shortages of higher-profit trucks and foreign currency losses combined to reduce its pretax profit for its automotive operations by 42 percent in the last quarter. But the conclusion of several tax disputes, some of which dated to 1982, allowed G.M. to post a gain of nearly 19 percent in net income to about $1.87 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.98 a share. Revenue rose 3.2 percent to $43.93 billion.
1/30/1996	Parts Contract From G.M.	Johnson Controls Inc. and Chivas Products Ltd. have received a six-year, $900 million contract from the General Motors Corporation to produce parts for interiors of G.M. vehicles, the auto maker said today. Johnson Controls and Chivas Products, a privately held, minority-owned company in Sterling Heights, Mich., will build a manufacturing plant in Detroit. Chivas will have majority ownership in the venture. Johnson Controls, of Milwaukee, will be responsible for product design, engineering and development, while Chivas will make the products.
1/27/1996	Saturn Plan For Used Cars	The Saturn division of General Motors plans to greatly expand its used-car business starting next month, Saturn officials said today. On Feb. 12, Saturn will begin a nationwide advertising campaign about its plan to offer used-car customers the same no-haggle pricing it offers new-car buyers, John J. Orth, Saturn's director of consumer marketing, said. The advertising agency Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco will handle the campaign.
1/24/1996	Ford Tests the Price Barrier;Auto Maker Takes a Risk With Fancy Redesigns	When the Ford Motor Company introduces the redesigned F-150 XLT pickup on Thursday, the truck will not have simple steel bumpers. Instead, its rear bumpers will glisten with chrome -- an option for which customers used to pay $150. Other popular options, like power mirrors, dual air bags and air-conditioning, will also be standard on the XLT, the most popular version of the nation's best-selling vehicle. And that's just the beginning. Many features, previously unavailable on the truck, will be standard, such as a more powerful engine and a new front suspension that gives a much smoother ride.
1/23/1996	U.A.W. Is Setting Bargaining Strategy	The United Automobile Workers union, in preparing for labor talks with the Big Three auto makers this summer, signaled today that just about everything it has bargained for in the past would be on its agenda again. It said it plans to begin negotiations in early June with a broad agenda including job security, health care, retiree benefits and limits on company subcontracting.
1/23/1996	G.M. to Cut Number of Dealers by Up to 30%	"The General Motors Corporation said today that as part of a plan to strengthen the identity of its brands, it would cut the number of G.M. dealerships by 20 to 30 percent over the next dozen years. John D. Rock, a G.M. vice president and the general manager of the Oldsmobile division, said the plan, which is expected to cost the car maker about $2 billion, was necessary because to stay competitive, """"you can't have muddled brands."""" The company said it hoped to sell more cars by putting a stronger emphasis on marketing individual brands instead of on overall image and price."
1/17/1996	Market Place;Energy Conversion Devices hopes to ride electric cars.	WHEN the General Motors Corporation announced earlier this month that it would be the first of the Big Three auto makers to market electric cars in four Western cities, the stock prices of eight companies whose primary business is electric cars rose sharply. But that does not mean that this is necessarily the time to buy them. One beneficiary is Energy Conversion Devices Inc. of Troy, Mich., which has a joint venture with G.M. to produce an advanced battery for the new car. The nickel hydride battery is made of environmentally safe materials and holds a charge longer than conventional lead acid batteries.
1/15/1996	Fortune Attacks Rival Forbes And Its Editor	"In an unusual direct attack on a competitor, Fortune charged in a cover story today that some large advertisers in Forbes magazine had been """"exempt from tough editorial criticism."""" The article said General Motors, Ford Motor, Rockwell International, General Electric and the insurer American International Group were among the advertisers enjoying favorable treatment."
1/14/1996	Corrections	The Driving Smart column in the Automobiles section on Dec. 24, about Oldsmobile's Guidestar navigation system, misstated the working of the system. It receives signals sent by global positioning satellites; it does not transmit the signals.
1/7/1996	Building All-American Vehicles in the U.S.	"Having failed to beat the United States auto industry, German and Japanese car makers have clearly decided to join it, as was made evident by several new vehicles on display here last week at the North American International Auto Show. Amid a growing number of made-in-America models bearing foreign names and enough new sport-utility vehicles to cause gridlock on a mountain trail, Mercedes-Benz served notice that it would participate in both trends, showing a thinly veiled prototype of its """"all activity vehicle,"""" to be assembled at a new plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The rakish Mercedes will combine full-time all-wheel drive with carlike characteristics, including dual air bags in front and side-impact air bags in the doors. The Mercedes, to be sold starting in the fall of 1997 at a base price in the mid-$30,000's, is poised to compete with top-of-the-line sport-utilities like the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, as well as with the much more expensive Range Rover."
1/7/1996	Dec.31 - Jan. 6;A Car for Tomorrow . . . And a Road To Drive It On	Electric cars keep trying to advance from the visionary to the practical, but it's a daunting leap. California tried to force the issue and decree that 2 percent of cars sold in the state be electric, but it recently backed down.
1/5/1996	G.M., in a First, Will Sell a Car Designed for Electric Power ThisFall	The General Motors Corporation announced today that it would begin selling an electric car in selected areas of the West this fall. The announcement came just a couple of weeks after California had bowed to industry demands in abandoning a requirement that within two years, 2 percent of all cars sold in the state be electrically powered. A General Motors official said there was no incongruity between that industry pressure and today's announcement. He said the company believed that there was not yet a market sufficient to meet the 2 percent mandate.
1/5/1996	Mixed Results in December As Auto Sales Slip for Year	Auto makers ended 1995 with some surprisingly good and some surprisingly bad sales, capping a year that on the whole failed to live up to the industry's high expectations. The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation both beat analysts' projections for December with solid sales gains over December 1994. The Ford Motor Company, however, posted disappointing sales, especially of its restyled Taurus.
12/30/1995	Government to Permit Tax-Free Split of G.M. and E.D.S.	The Internal Revenue Service has granted the General Motors Corporation permission to hand Electronic Data Systems over to the unit's shareholders tax-free, G.M. said yesterday. The ruling, issued late Thursday, removes the big obstacle to completing a $25 billion deal that would make the world's largest computer services company independent of the world's largest auto maker.
12/24/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Oldsmobile LSS;Helping Olds Find Its Way	AN impatient toot yanked my eyes from the dash and focused my attention on the traffic light, green for how long I didn't know. And that's the problem with being a gadget lover, especially at the wheel. If you're like me, you sometimes forget to drive. In this case, though, I forgave myself. Instead of watching the light, I'd been staring at the screen of Oldsmobile's new satellite navigation system, mounted in a 1996 LSS, and that magic map just might be the best thing since television or the Internet.
12/13/1995	Charging Standard for Some Electric Cars	The Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company took a small step today toward making electric cars more attractive to the public by agreeing to use the same type of charging system for the batteries. But the General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest auto maker, is pursuing a different -- and incompatible -- charging system.
12/13/1995	G.M. and Poland Agree To Build Opel Plant	The General Motors Corporation and the Polish Government reached agreement yesterday on G.M.'s plan to build a factory in Poland for about $350 million. In Warsaw, G.M. and officials of the Ministry of Industry and Trade said Adam Opel A.G., the German unit of G.M., had presented a plan to the Government for the factory to be built next year, and it had been accepted.
12/12/1995	Saturn Picks Agency For Japan Account	"The Saturn Corporation said yesterday that it had named Dai-Ichi Kikaku in Tokyo to handle its account in Japan, the first market the auto maker plans to enter overseas. The billings were not disclosed, but trade publications estimated them at $15 million to $35 million. Greg Martin, a spokesman for Saturn in Troy, Mich., said Dai-Ichi Kikaku was awarded the account after a nine-month review that was narrowed to that agency and two other finalists also based in Tokyo: Leo Burnett-Kyodo, part of the Leo Burnett Company, and the Tokyu Agency. He added that Dai-Ichi Kikaku would work with the domestic Saturn agency, Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco, to """"insure the consistency of Saturn's message."""" Saturn, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, intends to begin selling cars in Japan in 1997."
12/10/1995	After 2 Barren Years, G.M. Struts Its Stuff for '97	FOR a couple of years, the General Motors Corporation's cupboard has been virtually bare of all-new cars and trucks, and G.M. dealers watched longingly as fresh designs rolled onto the lots of rivals selling import brands or products from Ford and Chrysler. Now, however, G.M. is scurrying to restock its pantry for 1997. Further, in a departure from past practice, G.M. divisions are taking the wraps off new vehicles months before they go on sale. Such advance peeks served  Chrysler well when it was struggling to stave off bankruptcy, and the company has continued to show its cars months and even years before they reach the market. Ford and other companies are taking a similar tack.
12/10/1995	FIRST DRIVE/1997 Cadillac Catera;A Cadillac in Lederhosen to Lure the Young and Affluent	THE name means absolutely nothing. But the car bearing the Catera label means everything to General Motors and its flagship luxury division, Cadillac. The name Catera (pronounced kuh-TER-uh) was selected from thousands of suggestions of market researchers and Cadillac employees. The car Catera, scheduled for introduction next fall as a 1997 model, is Cadillac's first serious contender in the growing entry-luxury-car segment, dominated by Japanese and European imports that attract young, affluent buyers.
12/9/1995	G.M. in Argentina	The General Motors Corporation broke ground this week on a $300 million assembly plant in Argentina for Chevrolet Corsa passenger cars. G.M. plans to hire 1,300 workers for the 860,000-square-foot plant and expects annual production of 84,000 cars for sale in Argentina and other South American countries. G.M. announced the plant after sales at its Latin America division rose 21 percent, to 370,000, for the first nine months of 1995. (Bloomberg Business News)
12/8/1995	As He Steps Down, G.M. Chairman Looks Ahead	On Monday, John G. Smale relinquished his post as chairman of the General Motors Corporation, and G.M.'s board gave the title to John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., the chief executive. The move, reversing a decision made amid the company's 1992 board room coup to keep the jobs separate, disappointed many shareholders, who say that a separate chairman, drawn from outside a company's executive ranks, instills greater management accountability. In an interview, Mr. Smale, 68 -- a former chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company -- went on the record for the first time with his thoughts about corporate goverance, about his new post as G.M.'s lead director and chairman of the board's executive committee, and about the auto maker itself.
12/8/1995	G.M. Venture to Make Vehicles in Russia	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had signed a $250 million joint-venture agreement with a Russian auto maker, Elabuga Automotive Works, to build Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicles. The agreement will give G.M. its first assembly plant in the former Soviet Union. It will also be the first joint auto-making venture there for an American company, G.M. said.
12/8/1995	GENCORP EXPECTS DROP IN SALES TO GENERAL MOTORS	Gencorp Inc. said yesterday that it expected to lose significant business from the General Motors Corporation and that it was in preliminary talks with Cambridge Industries for the sale of its reinforced plastics division. The company, based in Fairlawn, Ohio, said that for the model years beginning in 1997, G.M. planned to convert its composite components in the mini-van line that includes the Lumina to steel from reinforced plastic. Gencorp's reinforced plastics division produces lift gates, doors, passenger side panels and other components at its Shelbyville, Ind., plant. Production of the components is scheduled to end in mid-1996.
12/5/1995	Chairman To Step Down In G.M. Shift	Marking the end of a brief but critical era at the General Motors Corporation, John G. Smale, the outside director who led a board room coup in 1992 and became chairman, said yesterday that he would voluntarily step down from the post on Jan. 1. The board of directors named John F. Smith, Jr., the president and chief executive, to the post of chairman and elected Harry J. Pearce, an executive vice president, to the board and elevated him to vice chairman.
12/5/1995	Chrysler Sues Iacocca Over Takeover Plan	"The Chrysler Corporation sued Lee A. Iacocca today, asserting that its former chairman divulged confidential information to Kirk Kerkorian while Mr. Iacocca was still a consultant to Chrysler. """"Iacocca has breached his fiduciary duties owed to Chrysler by disclosing confidential information about Chrysler to Kirk Kerkorian, a notorious corporate raider,"""" said the lawsuit, which was filed in circuit court in Oakland County, Mich."
12/4/1995	G.M.

Ms. Kunz, who is 41, will manage the finances of ITT's sprawling automotive, military, electronics and fluid-technology businesses, which would make up ITT Industries.
12/2/1995	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about a Federal pollution complaint against the General Motors Corporation misstated the formula for the $45 million settlement. The company is to pay an $11 million civil fine. It will also spend $8.75 million on compensatory programs to reduce air pollution from other sources, a figure that could vary depending on the effectiveness of the company's recall of about 470,000 cars. The remaining cost, estimated to be at least $25 million, is for recalling the cars and repairing the problem.
12/2/1995	G.M. SALES OFF AS A CHRYSLER REPORTS A RECORD NOVEMBER	The General Motors Corporation reported today that its sales in November had declined about 3.8 percent from a year earlier as the No. 1 auto maker felt lingering effects from a monthlong strike that shut down its major car hauler. Meanwhile, the Chrysler Corporation reported a record November, with sales up 5.3 percent from last year, proving that hot trucks and price cuts on cars can create showroom traffic. Among other major auto makers issuing American sales reports today, Honda and Toyota also showed increases, while Nissan, Mazda and Mitsubishi posted declines.
12/1/1995	Half-Million Cadillacs Recalled In Federal Pollution Settlement	The General Motors Corporation agreed today to recall nearly a half-million late-model Cadillacs and pay nearly $45 million in fines and other costs, settling a Federal complaint that the automaker had installed devices that caused the cars to emit illegal amounts of carbon monoxide. The company agreed to pay $11 million in fines and spend about $30 million on recalling and repairing the cars and about $4 million on compensatory programs to help control air pollution, senior officials of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department said.
11/30/1995	Tax-Law Changes Perplex G.M. and Others in China	Imagine negotiating for years to open a $1 billion manufacturing plant in China, factoring in all the costs and maneuvering a business plan over dozens of bureaucratic hurdles. Yet only weeks after finally winning approval from the Government, one of the major incentives that made the deal attractive -- the duty-free import of machinery -- suddenly evaporates. General Motors faces just such a shock. To a lesser degree, so do dozens of other Western companies that have recently signed deals in China. They are now waking up to the news that a sizable tax increase is at hand.
11/28/1995	G.M. Sales on the Rise in California	"When Ann N. Pattyn arrived in California from Detroit to assume the job of trying to improve sales of General Motors cars and trucks here, she was stunned at what she didn't see. There were plenty of Toyotas, Hondas, Mazdas and Subarus, but G.M. vehicles were scarce. """"It was very sobering when you drove the neighborhoods and expressways,"""" she said."
11/22/1995	G.M. AND SWEDISH INVESTOR IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SAAB	"Saab Automobile A.B. is losing money again, and its American and Swedish owners are discussing its future, company officials said yesterday. Saab, in which the General Motors Corporation and Investor A.B. of Sweden each hold 50 percent stakes, lost about $48 million in the third quarter, the company reported last week. G.M. said yesterday in a statement that it and Investor A.B., which is controlled by the Wallenberg family of Sweden, had held """"a number of constructive discussions on how to get Saab back on a sound financial footing."""" Speculation has arisen that G.M. might take over Investor A.B.'s stake in Saab. But in the statement, G.M. said it remained comfortable with the 50-50 split."
11/15/1995	Electronic Data Systems enlists Bates Worldwide to help it build name recognition.	FOR years, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation has had something of an image problem. The problem was simply that it did not have much of an image beyond a select circle of customers, which were mainly large companies and government agencies. And whatever image it had was frequently overshadowed by its outspoken founder, Ross Perot, who sold E.D.S. to the General Motors Corporation in 1984, or by G.M.
11/2/1995	G.M. and Chrysler's October Sales Better Than Expected	The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation surprised analysts today with smaller-than-expected declines in October sales. At General Motors, total sales fell 2.7 percent from October last year, while Chrysler's sales fell 2.8 percent. Analysts had anticipated a drop of 5 percent for Chrysler, while some analysts saw G.M. sales dropping as much as 6 percent.
10/27/1995	S.&P. Lifts Rating Of Some G.M. Debt	"The Standard & Poor's Corporation increased its rating on the General Motors Corporation's senior debt yesterday, citing the auto maker's higher profits, as well as G.M.'s efforts to improve its product line, cut costs and reduce its unfinanced pension liabilities. G.M.'s rating was raised one notch, to """"A-,"""" putting G.M.'s debt at the same level as the Chrysler Corporation's and two notches below the Ford Motor Company's senior debt, which is rated """"A+."
10/25/1995	Detroit's Japan-Friendly Cars Go to Tokyo	In years past, American automobile executives came to the Tokyo Motor Show to see the latest competitive challenges they would be facing from Japan. But at this year's show, which opens on Wednesday, the American auto makers will be exhibiting as much as looking. For the first time, the Big Three are displaying numerous models to sell in Japan, beginning in 1996, with steering wheels on the right sides of cars and trucks.
10/25/1995	Olivetti Contract	The computer maker Ing. C. Olivetti & Company and Hughes Network Systems have won a contract to provide a satellite telecommunications network for Adam Opel A.G. and Vauxhall Motors, the German and British operations of the General Motors Corporation. The contract is worth $50 million to $70 million, said people familiar with the deal. The contract places Hughes Olivetti Telecom, the telecommunications joint venture between the two companies, among the top operators of satellite communications systems in Europe. (Bloomberg Business News)
10/25/1995	G.M. Sets Out on a Long Road in China	The General Motors Corporation's victory in Shanghai, where Chinese officials have apparently selected the big American auto maker as a partner in a $1 billion assembly plant, is only one step in a long, tortuous process of negotiation. Although automobile executives said that G.M. had beat out the Ford Motor Company for the deal, expected to be the largest auto joint venture in China, the executives also noted that being chosen as a partner simply allowed G.M. to start negotiating a joint-venture agreement.
10/24/1995	China Chooses General Motors For Big Venture	China has selected the General Motors Corporation to be its partner in a $1 billion joint venture to manufacture cars in Shanghai, auto executives familiar with details of the project said today. By teaming with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, one of China's most profitable state-owned companies with an expert distribution and servicing network, G.M. will gain a dominant position in China's fast-growing car market.
10/22/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL: 1996 Pontiac Sunfire SE Convertible;A Small Car With a Sunny Disposition	WHEN it comes to cars, I complain about a lot of things. In fact, my wife says I complain a lot, period. But for all of today's automotive wizardry, plenty of things are wrong. Air bags, for example, are just terrific. But one of their first casualties was the glove box, which was eliminated or smashed flat because -- so I was told when I groused -- the passenger bag took up the space.
10/20/1995	G.M. Feels A.O.K. About Vehicle Design Management	It is autumn in the Motor City, the locust trees are turning gold, and the General Motors Corporation -- with a mix of grandeur, mystery and familiarity -- said today that it was continuing to reorganize its vehicle development process. In brief, the company named the 13 V.L.E.s who will manage the V.D.P. under N.A.O. That is, it identified the people who will oversee development, knitting together G.M.'s far-flung, diffuse operations.
10/18/1995	G.M. Surprise: Profit Beats Expectations	A year ago, the General Motors Corporation reported surprisingly little profit for the third quarter. Investors gasped, and then stampeded. Today, G.M. surprised auto analysts with third-quarter earnings far higher than they expected. But as the auto giant eagerly described its turnaround, investors, mesmerized by slicker high-technology stocks, only yawned.
10/16/1995	A Unit of G.M. Goes With Bates	The Electronic Data Systems Corporation, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, has named Bates Worldwide in New York as its worldwide agency of record. The billings were estimated at $40 million. Bates, a unit of Cordiant P.L.C., was selected on Friday after a seven-month review that began when E.D.S. decided to seek a single agency to handle its advertising worldwide as part of what the company called a global branding project. A small New York agency, Goldsmith/ Jeffrey, has handled the account in the United States since May 1993.
10/13/1995	International Briefs; Opel Seeks Polish Plant	The General Motors Corporation's German unit, Adam Opel A.G., has offered to spend 400 million marks ($280 million) to build a car factory in Poland, but formal talks have not started. An Industry Ministry spokeswoman, Beata Nawracka, said yesterday that the ministry received a letter from Opel earlier this week on plans to invest in Poland to produce about 100,000 vehicles annually beginning in 1998. G.M. has apparently lost a race to take over Poland's state-owned car maker, FSO, to the Daewoo Motor Company of South Korea. (Reuters)
10/12/1995	Saving the Tarrytown Riverbank	The Hudson River, with its breathtaking panoramas, is one of the world's great waterways. But its riverbanks suffer the legacy of an era when the Hudson was valued more as an industrial site than as a natural wonder. As industry moves out, local and state governments need to move forcefully to see that these big pieces of riverbank are used well. They are a natural resource of great potential. Such an opportunity now exists in North Tarrytown. First built in 1898, the General Motors assembly plant on the village's riverfront is the company's oldest. The plant will close next fall, and its minivan assembly operations will be moved to Georgia. For the past two years the company and the villages of Tarrytown and North Tarrytown have been trying to work out the terms of G.M.'s departure from the 98-acre site.
10/11/1995	Disability Themes Win Praise	ITT Hartford Life, Kraft Foods and the Saturn Corporation shared top honors last night at the sixth annual National Easter Seal EDI Awards ceremony in New York, honoring communications that enhance the independence of people with disabilities.

Walter Thompson Chicago, a unit of the WPP Group, won the Grand EDI award in the broadcast advertising category.
10/8/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1996 Saturn SL2; G.M.'s Satellite: A New Spin	I WILL not soon forget my first test drive of the original Saturn. In November 1989, at General Motors' Arizona test track, a wild boar darted in front of me as I gunned down a straightaway. Unable to avoid him, I clipped his hindquarters. The boar lay whimpering at the side of the road until a security guard put him out of his misery. The experience was memorable, but not because of the car. And so it is with Saturn buyers and their automobiles.

10/8/1995	Saturn Comes to a Crossroads	"A DECADE after General Motors created the Saturn Corporation as a separate company to build and sell small cars in a new way, there is considerable evidence of its success. Customers snap up every available Saturn at list price, and they speak enthusiastically, without prompting, about the """"Saturn spirit."""" Some 44,000 owners and families attended a """"homecoming"""" last summer at the company's plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., and another 130,000 took part in festivities at local dealerships. The company says 75 percent of its buyers are people who never previously considered a G.M. product."
9/19/1995	G.M. OF CANADA TO LAY OFF 500 WORKERS AT DIESEL UNIT	"General Motors of Canada Ltd. said yesterday that it planned to lay off 500 of the 2,900 workers at its Ontario diesel division. The layoffs at the London, Ontario, plant would take effect on Jan. 8, 1996. The company, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, said it would not be able to maintain the production level in 1996 that it has had since 1994. The auto maker said the outlook for 1996 was bright, but """"a return to a more stable market means we have no choice but to make a major adjustment to our work force at this time."
9/18/1995	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; A new campaign for a resurgent Chevrolet revolves around an old theme: the issue of trust.	HOW long will the Big Three auto makers pay for their sins? Here it is, fall 1995, and Chevrolet is starting yet another penitent advertising campaign. Chevy is asking -- pleading, really -- for your trust, a treasure it once had in abundance.
9/15/1995	G.M. Plans to Shrink Dealership Network	"The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it hoped to eliminate nearly 20 percent of its roughly 8,500 dealers under a plan to consolidate its sprawling dealer network. The No. 1 auto maker would like to get its United States dealership network down to about 7,000, said a G.M. spokesman, Thomas R. Klipstine. He said G.M.'s plan, which had been outlined previously without the numerical targets, """"doesn't have an exact date."""" The plan was developed as part of G.M.'s Project 2000."
9/12/1995	Hughes Aircraft Sets Purchase Of Magnavox for $370 Million	The Hughes Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation's Hughes Electronics unit, said today that it had agreed to buy the Magnavox Electronic Systems Company from the Carlyle Group for $370 million in cash. Magnavox Electronics, based in Fort Wayne, Ind., makes military communications and electronic-warfare systems. Hughes Electronics said the acquisition would broaden its telecommunications offerings and help it more quickly adapt commercial communications technology to military use.
9/12/1995	China Battery Venture	Delphi Automotive Systems, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, plans to form a joint venture with a Chinese partner to produce one million car batteries annually in Shanghai, G.M. said yesterday. The partnership with the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Holding Company will require an investment of about $30 million, and Delphi expects to hold a majority stake, G.M. said. Production is expected to begin in 1997. (AP)
9/12/1995	G.M. Settles 4 Lawsuits Over Safety of Pickup Trucks	The General Motors Corporation has settled four lawsuits resulting from fatal crashes and fires involving pickup trucks with side-mounted gasoline tanks, lawyers representing the families of the victims say. Neither side would disclose the terms of the settlements, as has been the practice in other settlements involving the G.M. trucks.
9/10/1995	SPENDING IT; Some Truth in Lending Comes to Those Murky Car Leases	"WHEN Michael Hoffman, a 36-year-old fund raiser for a charity, leased his fourth new car, it was the icons in Ford's lease that won him over, like the ringing alarm clock that went with the late payment fee. But he also believed that the price for his Taurus was fair. The $347 monthly payment set by Leo Kaytes Ford, in Warwick, N.Y., """"was about $40 less than those advertised locally,"""" he said. 'But with a closer look, he might have spotted a handy new tool that gives consumers a reliable way to comparison shop -- something that has been all but impossible before now, despite the popularity of auto leasing. Leasing now accounts for some 32 percent of new car transactions, up from 15 percent in 1991."
9/6/1995	International Briefs; Mexican Plant to Close	Three years after announcing that it planned to close its Mexico City truck and van plant, the General Motors Corporation said yesterday that the factory would shut down on Friday. Gary Cowger, head of the Mexican subsidiary of G.M., said that with the company's new assembly plant at Silao in the state of Guanajuato now fully operational, the Mexico City plant could be closed. (Reuters)
9/5/1995	Trucks' Popularity Undermining Gains In U.S. Fuel Savings	Americans who might sneer at driving a gas-guzzling Cadillac are tickled to be seen in a Jeep, Range Rover or Chevy Suburban. But the enormous popularity of these light trucks is reversing the nation's impressive gains in fuel efficiency. Because the Government sets a much looser standard for trucks -- including sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups -- they use far more fuel than cars. Light trucks get only 20 miles to a gallon of gasoline, on average, while cars get 28, according to the Department of Transportation.
9/2/1995	G.M. and Chrysler Registered A Sales Surge During August	General Motors and Chrysler said today that their sales surged in August to the highest levels this year, leading to shortages for new vehicles at dealerships. Sales picked up from a slowdown in July, helped by lower interest rates and higher sales to government and rental agency fleets, analysts said.
8/23/1995	International Briefs; Layoffs at G.M. in Brazil	The Brazilian subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation has laid off more than 1,000 workers as a result of a sharp drop in sales, a company spokesman said yesterday. The spokesman said the company had laid off 1,050 workers from assembly lines at two plants in the state of Sao Paulo. The layoffs reduced G.M.'s work force to close to 22,500 in Brazil. From June to July, G.M.'s sales in the country fell 36.2 percent, an auto industry trade group in Brazil reported, after the Government raised interest rates. (AP)
8/23/1995	New Retail Unit For McCann/SAS	McCann/SAS in Troy, Mich., a unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide that has as its sole client the GMC truck division of the General Motors Corporation, has formed a separate advertising and marketing retail unit, McCann/SAS Retail, with the local GMC truck dealer marketing groups as its only client.
8/20/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/GMC Sierra SLT, Chevy K1500 Silverado, Chevy C3500 Big Dooley; An Antique Hauler (And Antiques Haulers)	AT first blush, the rosy-red truck was underwhelming. I couldn't say so, though, because my son, Jay, had been searching for just such an example for a year or more, and the requisite $3,800 was burning yet another hole in his jeans. We were there to buy. The object of these mixed affections was a 1950 GMC pickup, and we managed to get it to Long Island from upstate New York without event, perhaps because it was so well rested. In fact, the truck's 45-year life in a firehouse had been remarkably sheltered, and there are just 15,000 miles on the odometer.
8/20/1995	Detroit Plans Some Grand Openings for '96 Pickups	BOTH General Motors and the Ford Motor Company will soon offer pickups with a significant change in their architecture: an extra door will be available on extended-cab versions of some models that will provide unobstructed access to the area behind the front seats. G.M. will be first to market the feature, which it calls a side-access panel, as an option on the 1996 extended-cab Chevrolet C/K and GMC Sierra full-size pickups that it will introduce in November. Extended-cab versions of G.M.'s compact pickups, the Chevrolet S-series and GMC Sonoma, will offer the feature starting in December. G.M. is expected to price the option for less than air-conditioning, which costs about $800.
8/13/1995	'Vette Gallery: The Art and The Agony	"EARLY in Ron Howard's moony thriller """"Apollo 13,"""" there is a moment of comic foreshadowing as Jim Lovell's 1970 Corvette stalls in traffic. """"Second time it's done that today,"""" says Tom Hanks, who portrays the astronaut. The movie audience in Bowling Green, Ky., home of General Motors' Corvette factory and the National Corvette Museum, laughed mirthlessly, then groaned in bitter recognition. Like the space program, America's sports car has had its share of ups and downs: from the """"giant leap for mankind"""" split-window coupes of 1963, to the """"Houston, we have a problem"""" days of 1983, when the Corvette was so shabby G.M. could not bring itself to market the car."
8/13/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1; Hurtling Into History	LIKE a bad daddy in one of well, all of -- Pat Conroy's novels, General Motors treats its best children the worst. The company bone yard is full of great cars discontinued by the marketing department just as they were perfected by the guys in white coats: the Cadillac Allante, the Buick Reatta, the Pontiac Fiero. On April 28, G.M.'s parenting skills hit an all-time low, as the last ZR-1 Corvette rolled off the factory line here and into the National Corvette Museum across the street. After a five-year production run of just under 7,000 copies, the absolute fastest American-made car and the world's bang-for-the-buck champion was put out to blue Kentucky pasture.
8/11/1995	G.M.'s New Development Plan Would Cut 5,000 Engineer Jobs	The General Motors Corporation said today that it planned to cut the cost of developing its vehicles 25 percent by blending design and manufacturing. The new approach would require fewer engineers. As a result, the company would cut 5,000 jobs, internally and at outside suppliers, starting in January 1997.
8/10/1995	Mexican Peso Fall Leads To Auto-Sales Standstill	In the aftermath of the peso crisis, Mexico has turned into an incredible shrinking market for new-car sales, and world auto companies are scrambling to adjust. Mexicans are not buying cars. The peso's slide cut deeply into their buying power while interest rates on car loans hover around 46 percent. In the first half of this year, new vehicle sales dipped by 70 percent from the corresponding period in 1994.
8/8/1995	G.M. Planning to Split Off E.D.S. in Shareholder Deal	Eleven years after buying Electronic Data Systems from Ross Perot, the General Motors Corporation said today that it intended to part with the company through a stock swap that would leave it in the hands of its shareholders. The long-expected split would allow E.D.S., the rapidly growing computer services company, to acquire other companies and to pursue mergers in its tumultuous industry more easily than it could with its intricate ties to G.M.
7/23/1995	Output Is Up; So Are Complaints on Quality	GENERAL MOTORS is selling every sport utility vehicle it can make, but a survey has found that soon after they find a home, they generate far more customer complaints than do new cars. No wonder. In my test of Chevrolet's Blazer, Tahoe and Suburban, an ashtray fell out of the dash and a seat adjuster proved balky (Blazer), a power window came off its track (Tahoe), a plastic shield on a shoulder belt was not properly fastened and easily came off, screw covers were not secure, another seat was balky and a light under the hood flickered (Suburban). A colleague recently drove a Tahoe with a Chevrolet engineer and both agreed it had a noisy wiper motor.
7/23/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe and Blazer; Sibling Rivalry in Chevy's Rugged Clan	IF Goldilocks still liked to wander in the woods, Chevrolet showrooms could offer her at least as many off-roading choices as she found on that storied day she came across the bears. There is the Suburban, the papa bear of four-wheel-drive light trucks; the Blazer, the smallish but feisty sport utility that was redesigned for this year, and now the Tahoe, which is meant to fill the gap in between.
7/21/1995	Ford Is Buying Stake in Chinese Company	"The Ford Motor Company is buying a stake in the Jiangling Motors Corporation, a Chinese light-truck maker, gaining a foothold in China as its United States rivals stumble. """"We are selling 174 million shares, and Ford has agreed to buy 80 percent of those shares,"""" said Fu Guohang, an official at Jiangling's securities department. """"The specifics of the deal haven't been signed yet, but Ford is definitely taking the shares."
7/21/1995	G.M. Rise Bucks Quarter's Auto Earnings Trend	If they ever played Broadway instead of Wall Street, the Big Three auto companies might consider calling their act The Perils of Pollyanna. With their widely varying second quarter earnings reports this week, they demonstrated the danger in their business of excessive optimism. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, which had breathlessly predicted robust sales this spring, built too many cars and trucks and watched their earnings slide in the second quarter as they ladled out rebates and other incentives to entice indifferent buyers.
7/20/1995	G.M. to Raise Production	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would increase its North American production by 3 percent in the third quarter. It said it would build 1.2 million cars and trucks during the quarter in the United States, Canada and Mexico. G.M. also said it built 1.52 million vehicles in the second quarter, down 3.3 percent from the second quarter of 1994.
7/9/1995	Jack and John: 2 for The Road At G.M.	ONE Saturday last February, a bunch of high-powered General Motors executives, board members and their spouses divided into teams and spent the next few hours building cars out of plastic pipe and glue. Then, with teammates pushing or pulling, they took turns driving their handiwork around a racetrack in the Arizona desert. At stake were prizes for the fastest and best-looking vehicles. When one car fell apart after 30 yards, what little was left of their executive dignity dissolved in a burst of snickers, hoots and guffaws. Some contestants thought this whole exercise, designed to encourage the directors to know G.M. managers and become more familiar with the company, a bit silly. But their presence in the desert that day says a lot about the power of the nonexecutive chairman of the board, John G. Smale, at America's largest company.
7/6/1995	While Incentives Often Worked, Vehicle Sales Slipped in June	June sales of cars and light trucks showed the power of incentives: vehicles with them generally sold well, while those with none remained for the most part on dealer lots. While figures released today showed that industry sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent in June from the corresponding month a year earlier, gains like Chrysler's 11.7 percent increase were bolstered by heavy incentives. Indeed, auto makers and dealers combined spent an average of $2,700 a vehicle to promote sales, including cash rebates to customers and incentives for dealer sales forces, according to CNW Marketing/Research in Bandon, Ore. That amount was more than double the year-ago level and the highest since January 1992.
7/4/1995	Opel Employee Inquiry	The office of the district attorney in Darmstadt, Germany, said yesterday that it was investigating employees and associates of Adam Opel A.G., the German subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, on suspicion of improper awarding of contracts. Opel and the district attorney said the police had searched company premises and the office and company car of a board member, Peter Enderle, on Friday. Opel said it had initiated the investigation itself in September.
6/30/1995	CHEVROLET LOWERS ITS SALES FORECAST FOR THE YEAR	The Chevrolet division of the General Motors Corporation has trimmed its sales expectations for the year because of production problems and sluggish sales, the Chevrolet general manager, Jim Perkins, said in an interview. Chevrolet now expects to sell 2.6 million units in 1995, down from an earlier forecast of 2.7 million. It sold 2.45 million units in 1994. Separately, G.M. said it planned to close its casting plant in Danville, Ill., at the end of the year, about six months earlier than initially planned.
6/29/1995	China Beckons and Car Makers Pant	China hungers for new cars. American car makers are dying to sell here. At China's annual car show, which opened here on Tuesday, thousands of eager buyers pawed at an array of shiny new models and car sellers did their best to tempt them with glossy handouts, flashy videos and seductively dressed women.
6/29/1995	Workers to Be Told of Gaps in Pension Funds	Large companies that do not have enough money in their pension plans to pay promised benefits must send their workers letters this year disclosing the shortfall and the potential consequences under a new Federal rule. The rule, issued yesterday by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, affects 4.3 million workers at 1,500 large companies whose pension plans have less than 90 percent of the money needed to pay promised benefits.
6/28/1995	G.M.'s Opel Unit Had a Profit Last Year	The Adam Opel A.G. subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation returned to profitability in 1994 but management fears that possible earnings gains this year are threatened by the strong German mark and high wages, its chairman, David Herman, said yesterday.
6/28/1995	Big 3 and Japan	"Of all the exaggerated claims made by both sides in the trade dispute, among the least credible is that the Big Three auto makers have earnestly attempted to penetrate the Japanese market, only to be blocked at every turn. Despite statements by the United States Government and the companies' own trade organization to the contrary, even Big Three executives concede they have barely tried. """"The biggest strategic mistake that we made over the last 30 years was not aggressively attacking the Japanese market -- from the standpoint of understanding the people that have become your key or toughest competitors,"""" said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of North American operations at the General Motors Corporation."
6/7/1995	TOYOTA ASKS FOR 200 CHANGES IN G.M. CAR	The Toyota Motor Corporation has asked the General Motors Corporation to make about 200 modifications on its right-hand-drive Chevrolet Cavalier before Toyota begins selling the car in Japan early next year, a spokesman for Toyota said yesterday. Toyota's suggestions include changing the layout of the gas and brake pedals and repositioning the seats, the spokesman said. Linda McGill, a spokeswoman for G.M. in Detroit, said most of the requested changes had been part of the normal product development process between the two automakers since the project was announced in November 1993. She declined to say if G.M. would agree to all the modifications. Toyota is planning to buy about 20,000 of the cars, which it will sell under the Toyota name. Toyota and GM declined to estimate how much the changes would cost, but both parties said the additional charges would not scuttle the project.
6/6/1995	E.D.S. to Join In Israel Venture	Electronic Data Systems said today that it had formed a joint venture with Kardan Technologies of Israel to provide computer services in the country. The new company, to be called EDS Israel, will be 55 percent-owned by Electronic Data Systems of Dallas, a General Motors subsidiary with operations in 41 nations. Kardan, a unit of Kardan Investments, will own the rest.

Said to Plan a Philippine Car Plant	Manila, Tuesday, June 6 The General Motors Corporation plans to set up a $1 billion car plant in Subic Bay, a former American naval base 50 miles northwest of Manila, newspapers here reported today. Quoting Rosario Estacio, the director of the Government's board of investments, the reports said the plant, with a capacity of 100,000 to 150,000 cars a year, would export its production to neighboring countries. If it goes through, General Motors' Philippine plant would be its third in the Asia-Pacific region, alongside plants in Australia and Thailand.
6/5/1995	A Drive to Build Playgrounds	New Jersey is several playgrounds richer today, thanks to the Saturn car company. As part of a campaign to show the company's commitment to local communities, owners of Saturn cars spent the weekend building new playgrounds in six locations in the state.

6/5/1995	Chevy to Sponsor U.S. Ski Team	The Chevrolet division of General Motors plans to announce this week in Denver that it will become a sponsor of the United States Ski Team with a comprehensive marketing, advertising and public relations program. In April, Subaru of America -- a company whose cars have long been synonymous with skiing and Colorado -- said it planned to end its sponsorship, which began in 1976. A Subaru spokesman, Richard Marshall, said last week that the auto company, which emphasizes all-wheel-drive vehicles and station wagons, had decided to focus more on grass-roots skiing than on championship venues. He said that while the partnership had been effective at promoting the image of Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan, it did not particularly help sales.
6/2/1995	E.D.S. AWARDED CONTRACT FROM BRITISH SOCIAL SECURITY	The Electronic Data Systems Corporation said yesterday that it had received a 10-year contract to provide data center and information technology services to Britain's Department of Social Security. While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, an E.D.S. spokesman said the contract would be the company's second largest in Britain, approaching the size of its $1.5 billion contract with Inland Revenue, the tax agency.

The cars will be produced at Saturn's complex here on the same assembly line as other Saturns.

Moody's Investors Service raised its ratings yesterday on about $70 billion of senior debt of the General Motors Corporation and the debt of some of its affiliates. Moody's also increased G.M.'s rating for commercial paper to Prime-1, its highest rating, from Prime-2, meaning that G.M. will find it less expensive to borrow short term. Commercial paper is a loan that matures in 2 to 270 days.
5/28/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Cadillac Fleetwood; Requiem for a Heavyweight	"I WAS leading a two-man safari from the farm store's loading dock -- me and the warehouse guy with 50 pounds of birdseed on his shoulder -- when I pushed a button on the gizmo in my hand. Twenty-five feet away, the Cadillac's mammoth trunk lid oozed majestically to a full gape. """"Hey,"""" my minion asked, """"did you do that?"
5/27/1995	10-Minute Clock Keeps Shots Low At G.M. Meeting	When the chairman of the General Motors Corporation muzzled a nun, any shareholder's hopes that G.M. might bend its new rules to limit their speaking time at its annual meeting here surely began to melt away. When he did it again, all hopes must have vanished.
5/20/1995	SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES GETS $1 BILLION G.M. CONTRACT	Superior Industries International Inc. of Van Nuys, Calif., has received a $1 billion, five-year contract from the General Motors Corporation to make cast aluminum wheels for all current G.M. models, Superior said yesterday.

5/10/1995	Small Cars, Big Comeback; Europeans Rekindle Their Love Affair With Bugs	"Giovanni Grimaldi is in love, and he's not embarrassed to talk about it. """"We used to have a traditional car, you know, with a front and back, but it was big outside and small inside,"""" said Mr. Grimaldi, a 45-year-old sound engineer here. Then he laid eyes on a Twingo, a perky little car built by Renault of France."
5/9/1995	G.M. Registering Shares for Pension Funds	The General Motors Corporation filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register 37 million shares of class E common stock held by the company's pension plans.

5/2/1995	FORD TO MAKE LEASE-BACKED SECURITIES OFFERING	In a first among the Big Three auto makers, the Ford Motor Company this month is planning to issue securities that are backed by its car leases. The plan by the Ford Motor Credit Company has been two years in the making and may set a standard in the industry. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, is also working on a lease-backed securities offering. An offering from the Chrysler Corporation is farther off, industry analysts said. If Ford makes lease securitization feasible in the market, it will open up a major new category of asset-backed securities, analysts said.
4/29/1995	G.M. Will Shed Some Models, Stressing Brand	Ronald L. Zarrella, the outsider hired by General Motors to impart distinct and vivid personalities to its muddled divisions and models, emerged from four months of studying the company today to announce that he agreed with the basic marketing strategy G.M. already had in place. But he is clearly fine-tuning the strategy. While General Motors has no plans to kill or merge any of its seven divisions, it will do away with some car or truck models, Mr. Zarrella said in a speech today to the Automotive Press Association here.
4/26/1995	G.M. to Sponsor AIDS Supplement	"The General Motors Corporation has agreed for the first time to be the sole sponsor of a special magazine advertising supplement promoting the annual """"Seventh on Sale"""" AIDS benefit.

4/21/1995	Argentina Site For G.M. Plant	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was planning to build a $500 million automobile plant in Argentina. G.M. said in a statement that the success of a $120 million plant opened in the central city of Cordoba last year, as well as expectations of strong regional economic growth, had prompted it to consider building a second factory.
4/21/1995	G.M. Profit of $2.2 Billion Tops Wall St. Expectations	The General Motors Corporation reported yesterday that a long-awaited turnaround of its North American automotive operations was responsible for strong first-quarter earnings of $2.2 billion, or $2.51 a share.

But the stock market reacted coolly to the earnings report, with G.M. shares closing at $43.875 each, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
4/21/1995	LIBBEY-OWENS-FORD WINS LONG-TERM G.M.

Libbey-Owens-Ford is a unit of Pilkington P.L.C., a supplier of auto glass based in London. The company would not specify the length of the contract, but said long-term meant at least five years.
4/20/1995	The ads for Jeep Cherokee and Chevrolet Tahoe appear to have something in common: imitation.	"IMITATION, so it often seems, is the sincerest form of advertising. When Orvis, the supplier of fly-fishing equipment, teamed last year with Chrysler's Jeep division to promote a plush Jeep, they hit on a natural theme. """"A Tradition Runs Through It,"""" declared Jeep's full-color, four-page advertisement."
4/18/1995	Court Rejects Coupon Settlement In Suit Over G.M. Pickup Trucks	"A Federal appeals court yesterday threw out the settlement of a huge class-action lawsuit that would have given $1,000 coupons to owners of 5.7 million older General Motors pickup trucks that are suspected of posing a fire hazard in sideways crashes. In its ruling, the three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, said the settlement was worth little to consumers and agreed with the arguments of opponents of the deal, who had called it a """"sophisticated marketing program"""" aimed at selling more G.M. trucks."
4/13/1995	2 Companies Aim At the Gay Market	Two units of giant consumer marketers -- the Procter & Gamble Company and the General Motors Corporation -- are aiming sales pitches at homosexuals for the first time.

The ads being run are part of their regular campaigns; Giorgio's, for its Wings for Men fragrance, is by Grey Advertising in New York and Saturn's, for its 1995 automobiles, is by Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco.
4/12/1995	Chrysler Engine Plan Is Sign Fuel May Stay Cheap	Chrysler plans to invest $750 million to build a new eight-cylinder engine plant within an assembly complex here, a sign that it believes gasoline will remain cheap and the light-truck market will keep growing. The engines would power two of Chrysler's most popular products, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a sport utility vehicle, and the Dodge Ram pickup truck, company officials said today. It was not clear if the engines would also be offered in Chrysler's large cars, or in a new, larger sport utility vehicle.

4/2/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/General Motors Impact; Future Shock: Driving an Electric Prototype	"FINGERS point and mouths gape when the Impact, General Motors' prototype electric car, glides by. Even blase New Yorkers stare at the futuristic coupe from sidewalks or crane their necks from their plain old gasoline-powered cars. Ninety years ago, it must have been like this to drive a horseless carriage. """"How fast will it go?"""" they ask. """"How far?"""" And, """"How much?"
3/28/1995	Car Makers Gaining Momentum in Brazil	Aiming to make Brazil a leading world car manufacturer by the end of the decade, the four biggest car makers in Brazil are doubling their investment, and new companies are planning to start assembly lines in this country. In rapid succession over the last few weeks, Ford announced a $2 billion investment; General Motors, a $2 billion expansion, and Volkswagen, $3 billion. Fiat said it intended to invest $1 billion in Brazil and $600 million in Argentina. Fiat's operation in Brazil is the Italian company's largest and most profitable.

Workers Threaten To Begin a Walkout This Week	About 7,000 hourly workers at the General Motors Corporation's truck engineering operations and its Pontiac East assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich., could go on strike Friday. The United Auto Workers union issued a five-day letter to G.M., which authorizes members of UAW Local 594 to strike Friday unless a variety of grievances are resolved, a company spokesman said today.
3/24/1995	Detroit Utility Is Cleared as Sole Supplier to Big 3	Regulators in Michigan yesterday approved a precedent-setting plan under which the Detroit Edison Company is to become the sole supplier of power to 54 assembly and parts plants for the Big Three auto makers for 10 years, in return for which the auto companies will get substantial savings on their electric rates. The trade-off agreement, the largest of its kind so far between a utility and its major industrial customers, is expected to be tried by other utilities.
3/22/1995	Jay Inc. Is Chosen By Buick Dealers	The California Buick Dealers, an association of seven statewide dealer marketing groups that represent more than 130 Buick dealerships, said yesterday that it had selected the Los Angeles office of Jay Inc. to handle its account, with billings estimated at more than $12 million.

3/21/1995	Canadian Rail Strike Denting the Economy	A national rail strike that began in Canada Saturday, idling nearly 35,000 workers, has already started to affect auto makers and other industries dependent on rail shipments and forced commuters to find alternative ways to get to work. Because of a shortage of parts, 6,200 Ford auto workers in Ontario were laid off or working half time. Delays also hit shipments of forestry products and such diverse minerals as sulfur, potash and coal.
3/21/1995	G.M. Confirms Government Inquiry	The General Motors Corporation said today that its primary finance unit had received an inquiry from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which are conducting an investigation of possible violations of Federal lending discrimination laws. G.M. said that its General Motors Acceptance Corporation unit had received an informal request for information related to its consumer loan practices from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.
3/19/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Cavalier; Exorcising Old Demons	HAVING recently gone to Hell and back, I can report that the trip is fairly pleasant -- particularly if you're behind the wheel of a 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier. The 120-mile excursion west from Detroit to Hell, Mich. -- a burg you'd miss if you blinked -- seemed to make sense, considering the devilish traits of the last Cavalier I had driven. That car, a 1993 model, creaked and rattled. Its body flexed and tossed over the slightest bumps. And the straight edges of its interior and exterior gave away its age, despite repeated face lifts.
3/18/1995	Moody's Checks G.M.'s Ratings	Moody's Investors Service said yesterday that it was reviewing the long-term credit ratings of the General Motors Corporation, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation for possible upgrade. Earlier this week G.M. contributed its remaining G.M. class E common stock to its pension plan, thereby substantially reducing its remaining unfunded liability. About $70 billion of long-term debt is affected.
3/18/1995	G.M. to Delay Introductions of Several Vehicles	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that several new vehicles, including its next generation of mini-vans, would reach showrooms three to six months later than it had planned. G.M. portrayed the decision as a result of a routine reappraisal of product schedules. But Wall Street analysts said G.M.'s seven-month struggle to introduce two new small cars had diverted engineers from the other vehicle programs, contributing to the delay.
3/17/1995	Hundreds Turn Out to Seek Jobs That Have No Future	When Jeanene Wright got to the Labor Department office here at 7 this morning, the line already stretched for more than two blocks and the jostling for position was so fierce that police barricades were soon thrown up to keep everyone calm. Like the nearly 900 other people who gathered here today, Ms. Wright was hoping to secure one of the hundreds of temporary jobs that General Motors Corporation will soon begin offering on the assembly line at its North Tarrytown plant.
3/15/1995	G.M. Honored In Reggie Awards	"A promotion marketing campaign for the Saturn Corporation unit of General Motors, took top honors yesterday at the Promotion Marketing Association of America's 12th annual Reggie Awards ceremony in Chicago. The Saturn promotion that captured the Super Reggie, called """"A Saturn Homecoming,"""" involved the visits of more than 40,000 Saturn owners to the company's plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., and the visits of close to 100,000 owners to local dealerships nationwide. The campaign, created by an in-house team, was selected from among nine other Reggie winners."
3/13/1995	U.S. Backs G.M. On Pensions	The Department of Labor gave approval yesterday to a plan in which the unfinanced pension liabilities of the General Motors Corporation would be significantly reduced. The plan will protect the benefits of 600,000 hourly workers and retirees from G.M., the department said. From an unfinanced pension liability of $12.6 billion at the end of 1994, the auto maker's liability will be reduced to approximately $6 billion should the deal proceed as announced yesterday, according to a G.M. spokeswoman.
3/13/1995	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Marketers Warn Agencies To Prepare Better for Future	"Advertising and agency executives have been anxiously waiting for the chairman and chief executive of the world's largest marketer to give them a thumbs up or thumbs down on how they have responded to his urgent call to confront the challenges of the new media. The verdict, rendered on Friday by Edwin L. Artzt of the Procter & Gamble Company: praise for """"getting much better control of the future"""" but a warning that more must be done """"to control our destiny to a greater degree, regardless of what form new media may take."
3/10/1995	G.M. to Sponsor Summer Olympics	"The General Motors Corporation and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympics Games said yesterday that G. M. would become the domestic car and truck sponsor of the 1996 Summer Olympics and the United States Olympic team. Though terms of the agreement were not disclosed, G. M.'s category of sponsorship, entitling the company to use the Olympics logos, costs an estimated $10 million. G. M. sought the sponsorship because it will be """"the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics and the 100th anniversary of the automobile in America,"""" said Philip Guarascio, vice president and general manager for marketing and advertising of the company's North American Operations. The Chrysler Corporation was a sponsor of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain."
3/7/1995	Interpublic Units Starting a Venture	"The Brockway Group, the unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies that produces infomercials and other direct-response advertising programming, has formed a joint venture with the Gotham Group, a boutique agency owned by Interpublic, to develop and market financial service products to consumers. Brockway has also been hired by five marketers, including the General Motors Corporation and Motorola Inc., for various assignments such as developing infomercials. """"We're trying to experiment with new models of how to do business,"""" said Martin Pazzani, chief marketing officer at Brockway in Huntington, L.I. The venture with Gotham, based in New York, will create conventional ads as well as infomercials, he added. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed."
3/4/1995	Mercedes View of Efficiency: Ford Has Pulled Past Toyota	The American auto makers, led by the Ford Motor Company, have surpassed Toyota to become the most efficient auto manufacturers in the world, the chief of Mercedes-Benz's car operations says. The Big Three auto companies routinely say that Toyota's operations set the standards, or benchmarks, for them as they try to increase productivity. But the Mercedes executive, Jurgen Hubbert, said he no longer looked to Japan for guidance, as he did in the 1980's.
3/2/1995	Fall in Auto Sales Raises New Fears of Slowdown	Sales of cars and light trucks fell in February, in contrast to a robust period a year ago, according to company sales reports released today and estimates by analysts. The results were below the expectations of Wall Street analysts, heightening fears of an economic slowdown and sending auto stocks falling on the New York Stock Exchange.
2/24/1995	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A Modest Low-key Campaign Belies the Case of Buying and Owning a New Chevrolet Cavalier	"ANY car can be easy to buy,"""" declares one of the mellow television commercials for General Motors' new compact, the Chevrolet Cavalier. """"The Cavalier is easy to own."""" So far, however, the Cavalier is proving both statements false. It has been easy neither to buy nor own, because G.M. has had problems producing the car at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio."
2/22/1995	G.M. PLANS TO INVEST $1.2 BILLION IN BRAZIL	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it planned to invest $1.2 billion in Brazil by 1996 to meet the country's growing demand for cars and trucks. Investments in Latin America could reach $2 billion by 1998, the most G.M. has ever invested in the region in a four-year period, said John Mueller, a spokesman for G.M. in Detroit. Richard C. Nerod, vice president in charge of operations in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, said the investments in Brazil would add assembly capacity, increase component production and allow for a broader range of vehicles.
2/22/1995	Market Place; After a failed merger, investors have voted for E.D.S., not Sprint.	IF William T. Esrey, the Sprint Corporation's chief executive, were a Wall Street stock analyst, he might be looking for another job. Last June, he sank a proposed merger with the Electronic Data Systems subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, saying that E.D.S. shares were worth so much less than market value, and his company's so much more, that Sprint deserved a premium of about a 20 percent. At the time, the stock market valued each Sprint share as worth 1.1 E.D.S. shares. But Mr. Esrey wanted 1.3.
2/19/1995	POSTINGS: Employees Vote to Remain; General Motors Decides To Stay in G.M. Building	"By now, a lot of New Yorkers are ready to scream, """"Enough, already!"""" to the seemingly endless barrage of building name changes: Pan Am to Met Life, Burlington House to Alliance Capital Building, Helmsley Palace to plain old Palace, and so on. So those New Yorkers will be delighted to learn that 767 Fifth Avenue will, for the foreseeable future, remain the General Motors Building. Against all expectations, the huge automobile company has signed a new lease for some 110,000 square feet in the building at 58th Street. But there's a catch: They are keeping only about 20,000 square feet of the space they have now."
2/18/1995	HUGHES INSTITUTE TO SELL G.M. CLASS H SHARES	The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which has an 18.8 percent stake in the class H shares of the General Motors Corporation, said yesterday that it would offer to sell up to 15 million of the shares to the public.

2/14/1995	A G.M. Unit Is Renamed	The General Motors Corporation said today that its Automotive Components Group Worldwide component operations had been renamed Delphi Automotive Systems. The name change was made to reflect the G.M. subsidiary's increasing business with companies other than G.M., according to J. T. Battenberg, president of the new company.
2/10/1995	The Black Entrepreneur At a Firestorm's Center	Just a few weeks ago, Frank Washington thought he had reached the pinnacle of success among black entrepreneurs. The son of middle-class parents who was born in a segregated hospital in the District of Columbia 47 years ago, Mr. Washington had an agreement to buy a large set of cable television properties from Viacom Inc. for $2.3 billion. But today, far from being lionized, he is at the center of a political firestorm, attacked as a front man for white-owned media conglomerates. His deal has been held up as a symbol of how a Federal program to help minority-owned companies has been abused, leading the House Ways and Means Committee to vote on Wednesday to repeal the program entirely and specifically block Mr. Washington's cable deal.
2/4/1995	Court Says Taxpayers Can Sue Over High Property Assessments	"What's good for General Motors may or may not be good for the country, but it could be very good for New Jersey taxpayers who believe their municipal assessor has it in for them. New Jersey's second-highest court ruled today that taxpayers can sue their assessors and their municipalities under the Federal Civil Rights Act. And they can collect compensatory and punitive damages, plus their legal fees, if they can prove the assessor acted out of malice or prejudice in setting an unfairly high assessment on their property. The ruling involves a lawsuit filed by General Motors over the tax assessment on its auto assembly plant in Linden. In 1986, the company saw its assessment rise dramatically in what company officials said was retaliation for past appeals, prompting them to file the suit. A lower court ruled that, under state law, an assessor enjoys absolute immunity from lawsuits. The lower court further said that it lacked jurisdiction and that the matter should be handled by the state's tax court. A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court today overturned the lower court's ruling on both counts and sent the case back for more hearings. It also agreed that General Motors could press a claim for violation of its constitutional rights under the Federal 1871 Civil Rights Act if it can prove the Linden tax assessor and other city officials were trying to punish the automotive giant for prior tax appeals. """"This is a very, very significant decision that provides an additional arrow for taxpayers fighting unfair assessments,"""" said John E. Garippa, a lawyer for General Motors. """"In rare instances where an assessing official acts so egregiously outside the bounds of propriety in setting assessments that it appears to be retaliatory, you can now allege a civil rights violation for that act, no matter whether you're an individual or a major corporation."""" While the appeals panel said that assessors did not enjoy absolute immunity from lawsuits, it nevertheless recognized a qualified immunity that protects assessors from lawsuits for honest mistakes. The 23-page ruling written by Judge Stephen Skillman recognized that allowing civil rights lawsuits may have a """"chilling effect"""" on a tax assessor's performance and may be """"disruptive of a state tax system."""" But the court held that """"these dangers are not a sufficient basis"""" to bar legal action based on the Civil Rights Act """"to a party whose constitutional rights have been violated."""" Judges Thomas F. Shebell Jr. and Steven Z. Kleiner joined in the opinion. """"If we were to hold that a civil rights action is not maintainable in the law division solely because an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights relates to a tax assessment, it would mean that a tax assessor could engage in a practice of racially discriminatory tax assessments without being subject to personal liability under the Civil Rights Act. """"Since prevention of racial discrimination by state officials was the essential reason for the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, we are unwilling to read a limitation into the scope of its operation which would prevent a state court from granting complete relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, for such a violation of constitutional rights."""" The appeals court pointed to other state and Federal court opinions that have held that tax officials can be liable for damages if they """"intentionally and unjustifiably"""" raise an individual's property tax assessment """"merely because of the individual's race, ethnic background or political affiliation."""" In 1985, General Motors built an addition to its Linden plant that cost $5 million, Mr. Garippa said. He said the municipal tax assessment on the plant increased by $30 million. """"That's a 600 percent increase and that's what led to the filing of court papers alleging the new assessment was in retaliation for prior tax appeals,"""" he said. Telephone calls requesting an interview with Donald P. Jacobs, the lawyer for Linden, and Mr. Frangella, the tax assessor, were not returned. Because the ruling was unanimous, there is no automatic right of appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court. But the defendants can petition the state's highest court for certification while the lower trial court conducts its hearing on the tax appeal."
2/4/1995	U.S. Vehicle Sales in January Appear to Show Slight Gain	Sales of cars and light trucks in January appear to have narrowly topped last year's level after adjusting the figures for recent changes in the reporting of sales. Seeming weakness in initial figures released on Wednesday led some analysts to conclude that the market had substantially softened. But the recent changes in reporting methods by most auto makers made year-to-year comparisons confusing. As other sales reports trickled in during the last two days, a better, but still blurry, picture of demand has emerged.
2/2/1995	Ford's Profits Conclude Banner Year for Big Three	By announcing today that it had posted a record profit of $ 5.3 billion for last year, the Ford Motor Company made it official. The Big Three auto makers made more money in 1994 -- almost $ 14 billion -- than ever before. And Ford's earnings report illustrated how they did it, even though the market for vehicles constituted about a million fewer sales than at its peak in 1986: emphasizing sales of more profitable mini-vans and sport utility vehicles like the Explorer, loading record amounts of overtime on their workers to increase productivity, and cutting other costs throughout the company.
1/23/1995	G.M. Pact Is Approved	Workers at a key General Motors Corporation parts plant here approved a new contract today, officially ending a three-day strike that caused 10 other G.M. plants to halt assembly work and component production. The contract, approved by a margin of 96 percent, calls for G.M. to hire about 600 extra workers at the AC Delco Electronics East plant in Flint. G.M. also agreed to spend about $70 million at the factory through 1998 to produce new parts there, said United Auto Workers officials familiar with the pact.
1/23/1995	Rose Kennedy, Political Matriarch, Dies at 104	Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104. Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.
1/21/1995	Auto Shares Decline On New Ford Moves	In a move likely to stoke fears that auto sales are flagging, the Ford Motor Company said today that it might close factories that make Windstar mini-vans and Escort small cars for longer than the one week it previously disclosed. And after the New York Stock Exchange closed, the Chrysler Corporation announced that it was expanding rebates on the more expensive versions of its Neon subcompact cars, which have been selling poorly.
1/21/1995	Striking Auto-Parts Workers Tentatively Settle With G.M.	A three-day strike at a crucial General Motors Corporation parts complex was tentatively settled late this evening, but not before it had idled more than 32,000 workers in the company's assembly system and halted lines that make popular and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Suburban and the GMC Sierra pickup truck. Officials of the United Automobile Workers union at the parts plant in Flint, Mich., said they would release no details of the agreement until a ratification vote of the local's 6,600 members scheduled for 1 P.M on Sunday. But they said that before the vote they would put 300 people back to work to begin shipping parts to prevent more assembly plants from closing. If the agreement is ratified, parts workers could be back at their posts as soon as Monday.
1/20/1995	Dealer's Plea in G.M. Fraud May Be Bargain of His Life	A year after he admitted bilking General Motors out of $436 million in one of the largest frauds in American corporate history, John M. McNamara, a former Port Jefferson car dealer, was back in the car business. Out on bail in 1993, with hundreds of creditors waiting to collect millions of dollars from him, Mr. McNamara took $300,000 from a $500,000 trust fund he had established in the 1980's for his teen-age daughter, and started a company in Florida that remade auto parts, he told a court last month. He also continued to live in a rambling white house with an indoor pool in this affluent village on Long Island Sound, and commuted freely between New York and Florida. He has not spent a day in jail.
1/20/1995	Parts Strike Is Shutting G.M. Assembly Lines	Several General Motors assembly lines ground to a halt today, deprived of spark plugs, instrument panels, oil pumps and other critical parts made at a sprawling complex here that was struck by 6,600 workers on Wednesday. In Pontiac, Mich., an assembly plant that produces two popular pickup trucks closed before noon, idling 3,000 workers. Later, a small car plant in Lansing and an assembly line in a Wisconsin truck plant also shut down, idling more than 10,000 workers. Other plants were expected to close soon. Negotiators for G.M. and the United Automobile Workers met here again today, but did not resolve their dispute over whether G.M. should hire new workers and give them more parts to manufacture. They agreed to meet again on Friday morning.
1/16/1995	Aging Auto Workers Travel Long Roads to Stay in Place	They gathered in the blackness of 3:45 A.M. in a commuter parking lot here, pulling their coats around them, shrinking into the seats of the Ford Club Wagon with their lunch boxes and their makeshift pillows and their gruff greetings. They drove the 87 miles to the General Motors assembly plant in Tarrytown, N.Y., by 6, still in darkness. They worked nine hours on the assembly line. As they drove home, the morbid banter rolled on: old age, aching muscles, spouses who have become complete strangers, and especially this winter's closing of the G.M. plant in Bristol that took away their old jobs. Then, somewhere around Waterbury, there was a subtle change, immediately perceptible to people who know one another's rhythms: Ricardo Torres stopped joking.
1/15/1995	Brookhaven Trial Raises Ethical Issues	ON breaks in the six-week-long trial on charges that he sold his vote to John McNamara for cash and car deals, former Councilman Donald Zimmer of Brookhaven often walked outside the Federal Courthouse in Hauppauge to smoke his pipe. Friendly and talkative, Mr. Zimmer, a conservatively dressed, squarely built middle-age man, looked more like a typical local official than a corrupt schemer facing a 20-year prison term. Indeed, Mr. Zimmer, who was on the Town Board from 1982 to 1989, when he resigned from the $35,375-a-year post to take a $125,000-a-year job at a company owned by Mr. McNamara, has described himself as the best councilman Brookhaven ever had and a friend of the powerless.
1/10/1995	Braving the Cold in Hope of a Job	"The General Motors Corporation will idle 200 workers at its Detroit Hamtramck plant starting on Jan. 17 as it cuts output because of weakening luxury car sales. The plant will be closed for one week starting next Monday, Ben Ippolito, a spokesman for G.M.'s Cadillac Luxury Car division, said yesterday. """"After that, we will have approximately 200 fewer workers as a result of a line-speed reduction,"""" Mr. Ippolito said. The Detroit Hamtramck plant makes Cadillac DeVille, Seville and Eldorado cars using 4,500 workers on two shifts."
1/7/1995	200 TO BE FURLOUGHED AT DETROIT HAMTRAMCK PLANT	American auto makers are celebrating a banner 1994, a year of ready customers and soaring profits. But one stubborn fact emerged today: The Japanese auto makers, despite offering higher-priced cars against American vehicles of improved quality, did not lose any of their share of the nation's car and truck market last year. In fact, they gained share, and the Big Three auto makers lost some.
1/6/1995	JAPAN KEEPS PACE IN U.S. CAR MARKET	With steel and plastic costs rising and demand for vehicles still strong, the General Motors Corporation said today that it would raise the prices of almost half its cars and nearly all its light trucks on Jan. 3. Although the increases varied by vehicle, they averaged seven-tenths of a percent, or $151, on base models, G.M. said. When it announced 1995 prices in June, G.M. said they would be 2.5 percent, or $494, higher than prices of 1994 models.
12/22/1994	G.M. Raising Many Prices As Costs of Materials Rise	The General Motors Corporation's Oldsmobile division is cutting about 80 jobs, or 14 percent of its corporate staff, as it eliminates four of 16 zone offices around the country. The reorganization comes as the G.M. division seeks ways to cope with a sales base that has shrunk from more than one million vehicles a year in 1986 to only 415,000 for the first 11 months of this year. The four zone offices being cut are in Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Washington. Oldsmobile officials said the reorganization was not expected to result in layoffs.
12/20/1994	OLDSMOBILE CUTS 14 PERCENT OF ITS CORPORATE STAFF	John M. McNamara, the Port Jefferson car dealer who has admitted receiving $6 billion in fraudulent loans from General Motors over 11 years, said today that he believed some G.M. employees had detected his illegal activities but chose to look the other way. Mr. McNamara's comments, on his third day of testimony in the Federal bribery trial of two Long Island politicians, were his first suggesting that anyone at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the auto maker's financing arm, knew of the scheme. Mr. McNamara also testified that he did not bribe anyone at the company to help him. And he offered no explanation as to why any employee might have tacitly cooperated.
12/14/1994	Car Dealer in Fraud Says G.M. Workers Must Have Known of Swindle	The General Motors Corporation cut its estimate of fourth-quarter North American vehicle production yesterday by another 1.6 percent because of chronic new-model delays and parts shortages for its unexpectedly popular trucks. The latest cut, after an earlier 3.4 percent reduction in output plans since September, could shave $40 million more from G.M.'s fourth-quarter profit, the Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said. The earlier reductions slashed $130 million from estimated earnings. Yesterday's cut comes as demand for new vehicles, especially sport-utility trucks, remains robust despite rising interest rates. G.M.'s stock slipped 37.5 cents, to $37.25, in New York Stock Exchange trading of almost 3.2 million shares.
12/10/1994	ESTIMATE OF NORTH AMERICAN VEHICLE OUTPUT CUT 1.6%	Two years ago, John M. McNamara, a Suffolk County car dealer, confessed to one of the largest frauds in American corporate history, but refused to speak publicly about the crime. Today, called to testify in a separate case, he broke his silence, explaining that he found it easy to trick General Motors into giving him more than $6 billion in loans for vans that never existed. Mr. McNamara, testifying as the Government's star witness in the bribery trial of three Long Island politicians, said that he was able to conceal the fraud scheme for years from the G.M. computer technicians who monitored the serial numbers of the vans and the G.M. auditors who showed up on his lots for what were supposed to be surprise inspections of his inventory.
12/9/1994	Dealer Says It Was Easy To Dupe G.M.	For days, jurors and spectators in a Federal courtroom here have been transfixed by testimony about a scheme to defraud the nation's largest auto maker out of hundreds of millions of dollars, a swindle so vast and complex that even the prosecutors do not know precisely how much money was involved. They have heard about a Long Island car dealership transformed into a veritable processing plant for fraudulent car loans, a place where, at the height of the fraud, bookkeepers churned out false documents for as many as 300 nonexistent General Motors vans a day.
12/7/1994	Senator Fires Fusillade Against G.M. Deal	"In one of his last acts before leaving office, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum convened a Senate hearing today to excoriate the General Motors Corporation and the Department of Transportation for their agreement last week that ended the Federal investigation into whether G.M. pickup trucks had a deadly defect. """"It smells like a political deal,"""" said Senator Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat who did not seek re-election this year. """"It is a bizarre fix that does nothing to solve the problem."
12/6/1994	Light Trucks' Sales Lift Auto Makers' Records	The sound of breaking records has itself become something of a broken record in Motown, as, month after month, sales of light trucks have topped past performances. November was no exception, the auto makers reported today. All three domestic auto makers set November records for sales of pickups, mini-vans, and sport utility vehicles. The General Motors Corporation sold 167,687 light trucks in the United States during the month -- 13 percent more than its previous record November, which was in 1978.
12/5/1994	Cost of Saving Lives	The brutal mathematics of safety, the inevitable weighing of money and lives, is rarely performed as publicly as it was in the legal settlement between the Federal Government and the General Motors Corporation announced on Friday. Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said then that he would drop efforts to force G.M. to recall pickup trucks he had judged potentially deadly in exchange for $51.3 million from G.M. to support safety programs unrelated to the trucks.
12/3/1994	G.M. and Ovonic to Make Batteries for Electric Cars	General Motors and a battery technology company will start commercial-scale production of nickel metal-hydride batteries for electric cars next year, the companies announced yesterday. Nickel metal-hydrides store about twice as much electricity per pound as lead-acid batteries, and can deliver the energy quickly. A Geo Metro converted to electricity with nickel metal-hydrides won an electric car race in Phoenix early this year by traveling more than 200 miles at highway speeds without recharging.
12/3/1994	U.S. and G.M. End Truck Case Without Recall	"Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena today announced an unprecedented legal settlement with the General Motors Corporation that will end a Federal investigation of up to six million pickup trucks he had called potentially lethal. In exchange for dodging a possible recall, G.M. will contribute $51.3 million to safety programs that Mr. Pena said would save more people than the trucks would kill. Mr. Pena sought to portray the settlement as the most efficient way to save lives, by swapping years of litigation to force a recall of a dwindling number of aging trucks for immediate help to """"save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of injuries in the next several years."
11/27/1994	Bribe Charges in Brookhaven to Be Aired	SOMETIME this week, John McNamara, the former car dealer and developer, will take the witness stand in a Federal courtroom in Hauppauge, and testify publicly for the first time about how he bribed government officials and lied repeatedly for years to bilk General Motors out of $436 million. Mr. McNamara, who pleaded guilty two years ago to defrauding the auto manufacturer by obtaining loans for vans that never existed, has told Federal prosecutors he poured the money into real estate ventures that transformed parts of sprawling Brookhaven, the Island's largest and fastest-growing town, during the booming construction era of the mid-1980's. He is now the Government's best hope for proving that official corruption was deeply woven into the fabric of town government.
11/27/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Pontiac Sunfire SE; More Sizzle, but Not Too Spicy	I confess I am a Pontiac enthusiast. It is genetic. Before our family grew so large that we moved up to a Chevy station wagon, my dad affectionately owned a string of Pontiacs. His first love -- a 1949 Mayan gold club coupe -- swept him away on his honeymoon. Amazingly, this man who can't remember his children's birth dates, much less their middle names, fondly recalls in minute detail shopping from dealership to dealership for his first car, finally negotiating $50 off the price of $2,339.
11/27/1994	Lost in Yonkers? An Olds Option Could Be a Guide	TIRED of trying to unfold, read and refold road maps in heavy traffic while looking for an unfamiliar location? Oldsmobile is offering navigational help for buyers of 1995 Eighty Eight models in the form of Guidestar, a computerized system that calculates the most efficient route to a destination and provides visual and audio information on how to get there. The help does not come cheap. Guidestar is currently a $1,995 dealer-installed option in California, the only place where the highway data base is sufficiently complete to permit full operation of the system. Olds plans to introduce Guidestar next month in the Michigan-Illinois-Indiana region, and coverage of the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut-Rhode Island area is expected by early 1995. All of the United States is due for inclusion by the first quarter of 1996.
11/22/1994	Overtime Is Money, but G.M. Assembly Workers Say They've Had Enough	If for many workers the American dream is drifting out of reach, the 4,800 General Motors workers here have nailed it down. They own homes, cars, big-screen televisions, sometimes boats. They have the assurance of secure pensions and good medical care. Many of these men -- and most are men -- earn enough that they can comfortably support their families; their wives don't have to work. But these workers, whether young and building families or older and planning for retirement, say they cannot enjoy what their labors have bought. G.M., they say, asks them to put in extraordinary stretches of overtime.
11/18/1994	General Motors Cries Foul On Hearing Over Trucks	With a bruising legal complaint attacking the Transportation Secretary's credentials and judgment, the General Motors Corporation today filed suit to bar the Government from pursuing his claim that up to six million G.M. pickup trucks may pose an unreasonable risk of killing their drivers and passengers. G.M. lawyers are also weighing whether to seek a preliminary injunction, based on the suit, to block the Transportation Department from holding a public hearing on the pickup trucks.
11/17/1994	For New Top Marketer, G.M. Goes Outside Auto Industry	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had reached outside its ranks -- outside the auto industry, in fact -- to fill what may be one of the toughest jobs in Corporate America: G.M.'s top North American marketing post. In the position, an executive is responsible for whipping G.M.'s fractious and overlapping car and truck divisions into line, convincing its independent dealers to sell vehicles more effectively and luring back customers burned by quality problems in the past. And for the job so crucial to G.M.'s success, the company chose an official who has been marketing sunglasses and contact lenses.
11/16/1994	REGULATORS DENY G.M. REQUEST ON PICKUP HEARING	"Federal regulators denied a request yesterday from the General Motors Corporation to go directly to court in a dispute about the safety of millions of older G.M. pickups. The Department of Transportation said it would hold a public hearing on Dec. 6. G.M. had asked the agency to call off the hearing. At issue are all full-sized Chevrolet and GMC pickups made from 1973 to 1987. In a ruling last month, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena found that the trucks, with side-mounted fuel tanks, could leak when struck from the side, and may have caused the deaths of 150 people. In a statement yesterday, G.M. said Mr. Pena was """"fundamentally wrong"""" and had a """"closed mind."""" The Department said hearings """"serve the important function of helping to further inform the department of additional relevant factual and legal matters."
11/15/1994	Ford in Negotiations for Pact On Electric Car Conversions	Like the look of a new Taurus or Windstar, but maybe not what comes out of the tailpipe? Then Ford will sell you one without a tailpipe -- or muffler, catalytic converter, engine, fuel pump or gas tank, for that matter. But only if you qualify. The Ford Motor Company plans to announce today that it is negotiating with U.S. Electricar Inc., a company in Santa Rosa, Calif., that currently converts Geo Prizms and Chevrolet S-10 pickups to electric power.
11/11/1994	Big 3 Want Clinton Aid On Rules	"Saying a Government finding of a safety defect in General Motors pickup trucks """"threatens the entire automotive industry,"""" the chief executives of the Big Three auto makers sent a joint letter to President Clinton today urging him to """"address the intolerable state of regulatory uncertainty"""" that the pickup issue could create. But a White House spokeswoman said Mr. Clinton could not intervene in a regulatory matter."
11/9/1994	Chrysler Switch to New Mini-Vans	The Chrysler Corporation expects to lose about 60,000 sales of its highly profitable mini-vans in 1995 because it will temporarily shut two assembly plants to prepare for new models, company officials said today. Auto industry analysts on Wall Street believe Chrysler makes $5,000 to $7,500 on every mini-van it sells. Taking the lower figure, that means the No. 3 auto maker could lose at least $300 million because of the lost production and sales.
11/7/1994	G.M. Is Getting Its Foot In the Door in Poland	The General Motors Corporation started its first venture in Poland this weekend with a fairly modest effort to assemble Opel Astras, but it said it hoped to expand its interests in this fast-growing car market. Small though it was, the $20 million investment in a joint venture with Poland's second-largest car maker, Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych, or F.S.O., commanded a large send-off, with opening ceremonies of a new assembly plant attended by top G.M. executives and high-ranking members of the Polish Government.
11/7/1994	Germany's Workers	"To the Editor: In """"G.M. Success in an Unlikely Place"""" (Business Day, Oct. 31) you find it perplexing that General Motors has discovered a motivated and efficient work force at its auto plant in formerly Communist East Germany. While you offer interesting reasons for this phenomenon, your comparison of the labor force in Eisenach with that of American green-field sites is far-fetched."
11/4/1994	Detroit Sets Truck Records As Vehicle Sales Jump 8.9%	Drawn by the fresh curves of some 1995 vehicles and the reduced prices on 1994 models, customers continued to flock to new car dealerships in October, buying 8.9 percent more cars and light trucks than were sold during the brisk period a year earlier, the auto makers reported today. During October, the first month of the 1995 model year, sales of cars rose 2.9 percent, to 738,221, while sales of light trucks -- pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- rose 18.8 percent, to 525,285.
11/2/1994	G.M. Asks U.S. to Drop Hearing on Truck Safety	In an unusual move, the General Motors Corporation has asked the Department of Transportation to call off a scheduled public hearing over the safety of millions of older pickup trucks made by G.M. and seek an immediate recall, a move that will cause a court confrontation. The move is apparently an effort by General Motors, the nation's largest auto maker, to avoid more bad publicity about the trucks, which the department recently ruled were defective and fire prone, as well as to force the Government's recall effort into court, where some lawyers and consumer advocates believe the company may well prevail.
10/31/1994	G.M. Success in an Unlikely Place	On a foundation laid by Communists, the General Motors Corporation has built a model of efficiency for the automobile industry in this reviving hamlet of the former East Germany. When G.M. began assembling small cars here two years ago, skeptics predicted that it would struggle to train and motivate workers enervated by decades under a Communist Government. But as G.M. has steadily increased volume and quality at this factory it has found the reverse. Not in spite of, but because of, their experience and lingering ideals, the East Germans embraced what G.M. is straining to teach workers worldwide -- the Japanese approach, with its emphasis on teamwork and constant improvement.
10/27/1994	Suit to Block Emission Rules Is Dismissed	A Federal District Court judge in Syracuse has thrown out a lawsuit by the Big Three auto manufacturers to block New York State's adoption of the California low-emission vehicle rules. New York now requires that all new cars sold within the state meet California's tough emission standards. The Ford Motor Company, General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation complained that because New York has not also adopted California's strict standards on gasoline, if they are forced to meet the stricter emissions standards they would have to manufacture a car especially for use in New York. Under the Federal Clean Air Act, other states may adopt California's rules or use the Federal rules, but may not require a third option.
10/27/1994	Ford Profits Up Sharply In Quarter	With car and truck sales climbing in the United States and manufacturing costs falling in Europe, the Ford Motor Company today reported that its earnings had more than doubled to $1.12 billion for the three months ending Sept. 30. Vigorous demand for products like the Windstar mini-van, Mustang sports coupe and four-wheel-drive Explorers enabled Ford to cut marketing costs in the quarter, fattening its profit on every vehicle sold.
10/27/1994	Almost 13,000 New Vehicles Are Recalled by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation is recalling almost 13,000 cars and trucks in 21 model lines to replace a faulty transmission that could cause the 1995 vehicles to break down after only a few miles on the road. Because the defect is not safety related, the company was not required to notify the Government about its action, and did not do so. The G.M. divisions that sell the defective cars and trucks -- Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac -- are notifying owners. G.M. believes that many of the vehicles are on dealer lots.
10/26/1994	SATURN WORKERS MAY APPLY FOR OTHER G.M. JOBS	The Saturn Corporation has agreed to let United Auto Workers-covered employees apply for jobs in other factories run by the General Motors Corporation, a break from its innovative labor agreement that emphasized Saturn's independence from G.M., The Detroit Free Press reported yesterday. In earlier years, workers were required to quit G.M. before getting jobs at Saturn. But recently Saturn's role has been diluted by G.M.'s decision to fold Saturn into a new companywide Small Car Group, by negotiations to build and sell an American version of the European Opel through Saturn dealerships and by a vote by Saturn workers to end weekly team meetings, the paper said.
10/25/1994	Corrections	A headline on Sunday about the resignation of the president of General Motors from the Bloomfield Hills Country Club after a black vice president of G.M. was denied membership described the club incorrectly in some copies. It does not have an all-white membership.
10/24/1994	Lessons in Rebounds From G.M. and I.B.M.	It seemed like two of the world's most troubled companies had finally gotten it right. In hard-won turnarounds, General Motors and I.B.M. were bouncing back from disastrous losses and just about everybody, from customers to investors, was cheering. But last week, the cheering turned to frightened silence at G.M., when it reported a worrisome loss in its crucial auto business in North America despite soaring sales. Though the company reported an overall profit, the disappointing loss in North America, G.M.'s first in nine months, prompted a panicky stock selloff on Wall Street and doubts throughout corporate America and in dozens of G.M. factory towns whether the renaissance of the world's largest industrial company was in fact on track.
10/23/1994	G.M. Head Quits Club After Black Is Barred	The president and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation has resigned from the Bloomfield Hills Country Club after a black vice president of G.M. was denied membership in the club, an exclusive bastion of the auto industry's top executives. John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president, resigned from the club after the application of Roy S. Roberts, a black vice president and the general manager of the GMC Truck Division, was rejected, said a club member who would speak only anonymously.
10/23/1994	Oct. 16-22: A Bad Week in Detroit; G.M. Trucks Singled Out; Ford Is Recalling Compacts	Transportation Secretary Federico Pena took a highly unusual step Monday: In effect, he accused General Motors of making pickup trucks so defective that 150 people might have died needlessly in fiery crashes. The vehicles are full-sized Chevrolet and G.M.C. pickups produced by the nation's No. 1 car maker from 1973 to 1987. The trucks have fuel tanks mounted outside their body frames. Safety advocates have argued that the tanks leak when struck sideways, spilling gasoline and igniting deadly fires.
10/22/1994	G.M. Stock Falls 12% In 2 Days	Investors continued to spurn the General Motors Corporation today, in a selloff that started with Thursday's disappointing earnings report and has lowered the total value of G.M. shares by $4.3 billion. In all, the stock dropped 12 percent in the last two days, after G.M. announced that it had a bigger-than-expected loss in North America. The drop capped a stunning week of setbacks and embarrassments that began with the Transportation Secretary accusing the No. 1 auto maker of knowingly selling millions of potentially lethal pickup trucks and being responsible for 150 deaths.
10/21/1994	G.M. Stock Falls on Results	Panicked investors dumped shares of the General Motors Corporation today after the company announced that despite strong car and truck sales and overall profitability, its core North American automotive operations fell back into the red during the third quarter. G.M., which was the most-actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, fell to a new low for the year, $42 a share, before recovering somewhat to close at $43.125, down $3.75 on the day. Amid fears that the company's cost-cutters had lost their edge, nearly 16.8 million shares traded hands. The sell-off accounted for 10.4 points of the 25-point decline on the Dow Jones industrial average.
10/20/1994	Economic Scene; Big government and the Big 3 pass the air pollution buck.	"FOUR years ago Congress got a big round of applause for requiring the states to reduce ozone air pollution to levels that don't send asthmatics to early graves. But it left the details to the states. And -- no surprise -- regulators in the heavily polluted Northeast, who must answer to diverse interest groups, are at a loss on how to get from here to there. Worse, perhaps, the only Federal agency with the power to drive the bargaining to a conclusion that serves the public is hoping, hoping, hoping someone else will take the political heat. """"The Environmental Protection Agency has abdicated its leadership role,"""" argues Dan Dudek, an economist with the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund."
10/19/1994	GENERAL MOTORS UNIT IN VIETNAM PHONE DEAL	"The GM Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors signed a $120 million contract yesterday to supply telecommunications equipment in Vietnam. Hughes plans to supply 120,000 digital phone lines in Ho Chi Minh City by the end of 1995. Its """"fixed wireless access"""" technology is a digital system that technically resembles a mobile cellular system. Instead of servicing portable phones or terminals, services are provided to fixed installations. Vietnam, a nation of 72 million people, had 346,934 phones in July."
10/19/1994	U.S. to Aid Big 3 in Cleaner-Car Research	"A year-old Government partnership with the Big Three auto makers has developed """"a road map"""" for building a car that would go 80 miles on a gallon of gasoline with no loss in performance, safety or carrying capacity, Vice President Al Gore said today. But smaller competitors in the race for high-technology clean cars are complaining that the three giants could squeeze them out of the effort. That is because the plan calls for the Government to coordinate its research and development spending by seven Federal agencies with the efforts of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. Much of the research involves using electricity to power cars, a technology that the Big Three have opposed, at least for now."
10/18/1994	G. M. Trucks Found to Be Fire Hazard Side-Saddle Tanks	Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said yesterday that a two-year Federal investigation of 4.5 million older General Motors Corporation pickup trucks had found that the trucks posed a fire hazard when hit from the side because of the placement of their fuel tanks. Mr. Pena also said that evidence reviewed during the Government's inquiry suggested that the No. 1 auto maker knew before it sold the trucks beginning in 1973 that placing the fuel tanks outside the pickups' body frame could pose a danger, but it went ahead and sold them anyway. Since then, Federal officials estimated yesterday, some 150 people might have died needlessly in fiery crashes because the original placement of the tanks allowed them to be easily punctured during side-impact crashes.
10/16/1994	Topics of The Times; Yesterday's World of Tomorrow	"Visitors to the 1939 New York World's Fair lined up for hours to see the General Motors """"Futurama,"""" one of the fair's star attractions. Inside, they cruised on moving chairs for one-third of a mile around a detailed diorama of what the urban-suburban-rural landscape might be in 1960, as it seemed in those hopeful post-Depression days before World War II. Among the futuristic concepts fairgoers saw there, and doubted they would ever see in the real world, was an automated highway. Model cars scooted along on a fixed path at a governed speed under external controls, freeing drivers to scan the sky, play cards or whatever."
10/11/1994	U.S. Investigating No-Haggle Car Pricing	As part of a wider antitrust investigation of auto pricing, the Justice Department is looking into the increasingly popular practice of no-haggle selling by car dealers, according to dealers and others who have been questioned in the inquiry. It is not clear what wrongdoing the Government suspects. Besides possible price-fixing arrangements between manufacturers and dealers, the investigators might be looking at possible price-fixing efforts among the dealers themselves or the manufacturers themselves.
10/9/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1995 Blazer; New Chevy: A Bag Short	MORE than a decade ago, I bought into Detroit's argument against air bags, thinking them to be only iffy adjuncts to seat belts. After all, the bags were of no use in side or rear impacts. They were unproved, and no one was sure that they would not blast off unexpectedly.
10/7/1994	Obstruction in Senate Costs the S.E.C. Millions	Gridlock in Congress may cause distress in middle America, but it is winning some fans in corporate America. Chrysler and General Motors are among the companies that have taken advantage this week of reduced fees for registering bond issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- a windfall made possible by Congressional inaction on the agency's budget.
10/5/1994	Auto Sales Rose 7.4% Last Month	Sales of cars and light trucks rose 7.4 percent in September, as the Big Three auto makers gained market share from foreign producers by virtue of the surging popularity of pickup trucks, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles. The strong gain in sales, reported today by the auto makers, came despite concerns that higher interest rates could choke off consumer confidence and the ability of consumers to make monthly payments. The report briefly unnerved the bond market, which saw it as a sign that higher rates were failing to moderate growth, and Treasury prices fell. [ Page D15. ] Stock prices were also lower yesterday. [ Page D8. ]
10/5/1994	New G.M. Revamping Focuses on Car Design	The General Motors Corporation announced its fourth reorganization in 10 years today in an effort to streamline its approach to developing cars. Executives stressed that the latest attempt would not yield cataclysmic change, like the reorganization of 1984, which paralyzed the company. G.M. said it would merge its four North American car development operations into two, while more closely allying them with its European ones, as a way to achieve economies of scale and to stifle the traditionally fratricidal competition among divisions of the company.
10/4/1994	Market Place; Analysts seem willing to overlook new hiring at G.M.	AS workers prepare to resume normal operations at idled General Motors Corporation components and final-assembly plants, securities analysts say the auto maker's third-quarter profit will not be greatly reduced because of lost production of cars and trucks in the three-day strike at its Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., last week. More significant, the investment community seems convinced that John F. Smith Jr., president and chief executive of G.M., has not backtracked on his pledge to make the company as productive as its rivals when he agreed to add 531 permanent employees to the Buick City work force -- after eight years of no blue-collar hiring.
10/4/1994	A G.M. Test of Productivity: Making Parts 24 Hours a Day	Two General Motors components plants in the Midwest are operating round the clock seven days a week as part of a broad effort to wring greater productivity from the company's high-cost workers, a G.M. executive said today. The highly unusual pace of production, a one-year experiment, is proving efficient, the executive said, and G.M. may put other plants on similar schedules as it hunts for ways to increase capacity on the cheap.
10/2/1994	Sept.25-Oct.1: How Much Is Too Much?; G.M. Workers Strike Over Workload	Last week 11,500 workers walked off the job at General Motors Corporation's Buick City manufacturing complex in Flint, Michigan, not over demands for a new contract but because they said they were sick and tired. But by week's end, union officials announced a tentative agreement to hire more permanent workers. The three-day strike idled nearly 22,000 workers in Flint and elsewhere.
10/1/1994	G.M. and Auto Workers Reach an Accord	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers today tentatively settled a three-day-old strike at the Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., that had idled nearly 22,000 workers there and at other G.M. plants and had threatened to shut down the company's production throughout North America. Although precise terms of the accord were not disclosed, union officials said General Motors had agreed to hire more permanent workers at Buick City, a step the company had earlier resisted. G.M. declined to comment.
9/30/1994	Strike Leaves More G.M. Operations Idle	As a United Automobile Workers strike entered a third day today, operations were scaled back at two critical General Motors Corporation factories that produce automatic transmissions, threatening to shut most of G.M.'s final assembly operations in North America within days. About 1,000 workers at G.M. transmission plants in Ypsilanti and Warren, Mich., were told not to report to work on Friday.
9/29/1994	G.M. Impasse: Work Strain vs. Rising Car Sales	"Last Monday, Barbara Griffith faced a dilemma as she worked on the assembly line here. She ached to go to the bathroom, but knew that if she left six co-workers alone to apply paint sealant to the steady stream of Buicks and Oldsmobiles coming down the line the team was certain to fall behind. Ms. Griffith, who has been working six days a week and up to 11 1/2 hours a day for two years, did not dare stop the assembly line; that might have led to a reprimand. So she did what she and her friends often do for one another: """"I stopped the line and told everyone to go to the bathroom. They can reprimand me if I go on my own. They can't write all of us up."
9/28/1994	COURT REJECTS PLEA TO KEEP LOPEZ FROM WORKING AT VW	A German district court yesterday rejected a plea from Adam Opel A.G., the German unit of the General Motors Corporation, that would have prevented its former employee Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from working at its rival, Volkswagen A.G. The district court in Braunschweig said that an employment ban against Mr. Lopez would be unfair and illegal punishment. Opel filed charges of industrial espionage against Mr. Lopez last year after he moved to Volkswagen, taking seven Opel employees with him. The charges are being investigated by the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt.
9/28/1994	11,500 Employees Strike At a Major G.M. Factory	"About 11,500 workers at a General Motors manufacturing complex in Flint, Mich., walked off their jobs today in a union-led protest, asserting that the strain of keeping up with a robust demand for cars was ruining workers' health. """"We have more than 1,000 workers on sick leave,"""" said Dave Yettaw, president of Local 599 of the union, the United Automobile Workers. """"At some point, organized labor has got to get off its knees. We haven't learned the lessons of our forefathers, that an injury to one is an injury to all."
9/27/1994	G.M. AGREES TO PLAN AT PARTS PLANT TO AVERT A STRIKE	The General Motors Corporation has agreed to add 118 additional full-time workers at its Inland Fisher Guide components plant in Flint, Mich., to avert a strike. Kathy Otto, president of United Automobile Workers Local 326, said a tentative agreement was reached on Sunday. The plant's 1,200 workers had authorized a strike but no deadline had been issued. G.M. will first offer the new jobs to workers laid off from the factory, which makes parts like door hinges. Talks at the Buick City complex between G.M. and the union continued yesterday in the face of a strike deadline of 10 A.M. today. About 11,500 workers threaten to strike if a dispute centering on similar staffing issues is not resolved.
9/25/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo; A Disco Cruiser of the 70's Wears a New Leisure Suit	"I DON'T want this to have more dramatis personae than an Agatha Christie novel. But here goes: When my wife's sister's mother-in-law bequeathed a castoff car to her son (my wife's sister's husband, who is named Frank), it was my first hands-on encounter with Chevrolet's """"personal coupe,"""" the Monte Carlo."
9/24/1994	Auto Workers Pushed to the Limit	With customers clamoring for cars and trucks, the domestic auto makers have been pushing their hourly workers at a record pace, and the strain is unmistakable. Today, the Ford Motor Company said that partly because workers at a parts plant refused to put in more overtime, it had to stop production this week of some popular pickup trucks and large cars. The General Motors Corporation is facing a threatened strike next week over the exhausting grind at a colossal assembly and parts-making complex known as Buick City.
9/22/1994	G.M. FORMS A PARTS UNIT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES	The General Motors Corporation, hoping one day to sell components to the makers of electric and hybrid vehicles worldwide, announced yesterday the formation of a business unit, Delco Propulsion Systems. The new unit, to be based in Indianapolis, will be a joint effort of three G.M. parts-making organizations: AC Delco Systems, Allison Transmission and the Delco Electronics Corporation. While G.M. has argued that battery technology has not progressed to the stage where electric vehicles can be viable in the consumer market, the auto maker is hedging its bet by preparing to take advantage of the electric-vehicle market if and when it blossoms.
9/20/1994	Delco in Saudi Venture	The AC Delco Systems division of the General Motors Corporation has formed a joint venture with a group of Saudi industrialists to build a battery plant in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia for the automotive after-market. G.M. will have a 49 percent equity stake in the plant, which will produce about a million batteries a year. The venture will manufacture and market Delco Freedom maintenance-free batteries for automotive, commercial, marine and specialty markets in the Middle East.
9/16/1994	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A couple of auto makers set out to buff up some rusty brand names.	WITH sales rising and a slew of new models pending, the Big Three auto makers are turning their attention to restoring the images of older brands that have lost their luster, or their way, in recent years. Besides ephemeral advertising heralding 1995 models, the brand-building campaign is taking more tangible, and probably durable, forms: At Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division, it means a less-confusing sign at its dealerships, while at General Motors' Oldsmobile division, it means classier theme music.
9/13/1994	G.M. Promotion Gives Lift to Operations Abroad	In a move to add organizational status and prestige to its overseas operations, the General Motors Corporation promoted Louis R. Hughes to the new post of president of G.M. International and named two other European automotive executives to senior posts in its international management. Mr. Hughes, 45, will remain in Zurich as head of General Motors Europe and as an executive vice president of G.M. Mr. Hughes, who is regarded as one of the auto maker's brightest executives, is being elevated to the same status as Rick Wagoner, who was recently named president of North American operations and J. T. Battenberg 3d, who is president of the worldwide parts operations.
9/8/1994	Ruling May Further Open U.S. Auto Market to Japan	In a decision that could help Japanese auto makers re-enter the two-door sport-utility vehicle market in the United States, a Federal appeals court ruled today that the two-door Nissan Pathfinder was wrongly classified as a cargo vehicle, subjecting it to a 25 percent import tariff. Instead, the court ruled, United States Customs should treat the two-door Pathfinder as consumers would -- as a passenger vehicle -- and subject it only to the 2.5 percent tariff for imported cars. Partly because of the steep cargo tariff, which was imposed in March 1989, Nissan stopped importing the two-door Pathfinder in 1990; also, the Toyota Motor Company stopped importing a two-door sport-utility vehicle.
9/6/1994	G.M. to Install Daytime Lights	The General Motors Corporation expects to equip all its cars and trucks with daytime running lights by 1997. G.M., which is the first United States auto maker to install the safety system, will produce more than 1.5 million vehicles with daytime running lights by the end of 1995.
9/4/1994	Corvette Museum	On July 2, 1992, the Chevrolet assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky., produced its one millionth Corvette. That white convertible with a red interior is now on permanent display with 52 other Corvettes -- including an original model from 1953 -- at the new National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green. Also on view is the 1990 ZR1 racing Corvette that set a world endurance record by going 175 miles an hour for 24 hours -- and the world's only Corvette with an aluminum body. The museum is at 350 Corvette Drive; (502) 781-7973.
9/1/1994	Insider Selling Trims Auto Stocks	Share prices of the Big Three auto makers tumbled yesterday, as reports of insider selling at the Chrysler Corporation apparently rekindled fears that the peak in auto sales and profits might have passed. Chrysler's stock was the first to get pounded, but investors later broadened their selling to shares of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation as well.
8/30/1994	Luxury Car Fight Turns Uncivilized	"Some blame the sport-utility vehicles, others the higher income taxes on the very wealthy. Some claim """"90's values"""" have made the rich self-conscious, while still others argue that fears of health care cost-cutting have made doctors miserly. Whatever the reason, the luxury car market, roughly defined as cars costing more than $25,000, or about 13 percent of car sales in the United States, is in turmoil, and the calfskin gloves have come off."
8/28/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1995 Aurora; Olds Is Hitching Its Hopes to A Rising Starship	WHEN you look at Oldsmobile's slick new Aurora, it's hard to believe that only a couple of years ago there were mutterings inside General Motors about killing off the Olds division. And when you think about Oldsmobile's history, the whole notion is even more preposterous. Olds, of course, is one of America's oldest car nameplates, established in 1897 and flourishing long before it came into the G.M. fold in 1908.
8/27/1994	Job Cuts and Grass Roots; Strike at a G.M. Parts Plant Demonstrated How a Union's Clout Has Shifted to Locals	For the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union, labor politics is increasingly local, as demonstrated this week by the strike of 3,300 G.M. parts makers in Anderson, Ind. The haggling over national labor contracts every three years in Detroit is a dramatic ritual, and it does set the broad terms of the relationship. But G.M.'s sweeping, stop-and-go campaign to cut costs and jobs has been largely a matter of incremental gains eked out plant by plant in negotiations with local union officials.
8/27/1994	Toyota Widens a Price Gap	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union reached a settlement tonight to end a small but crippling three-day-old strike at a parts-making complex in Anderson, Ind. For want of parts made by Anderson's 3,300 workers -- tail lights, brake lights and bumpers -- 13 G.M. assembly plants throughout North America shut down today, idling 42,850 hourly and salaried workers elsewhere and cutting off deliveries to dealers of Corvettes, Camaros, full-size pickup trucks and at least 20 other models.
8/26/1994	Strike at G.M. Parts Plant Ends After Idling 46,000	"A United Automobile Workers union local struck a General Motors components plant in Indiana today, cutting off the supply of crucial parts to G.M. assembly plants nationwide. The assembly plants had enough inventory of the parts, including bumpers and headlamps, to operate today, a company spokesman, John Shea, said. He declined to say how many assembly plants might be affected, or whether production could be disrupted as soon as Wednesday. """"We're not getting into any speculation now,"""" he said."
8/24/1994	Strike Shuts Key Plant For G.M.	THEIR names are John and Roger, and they have a lot in common. Both spent their entire professional lives at one employer, and both rose to the top early enough to have a long tenure that shaped the character and the prospects of their companies. Both men were unquestionably dedicated to their jobs, and both made serious mistakes that severely damaged the firms they loved and led.
8/21/1994	A Sad Tale Of Penalties For Failure	"The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that higher interest rates might cut its pension liabilities by more than $7 billion this year. At the end of last year, the company estimated that it had set aside $22.3 billion less than required to pay the pensions for future retirees, the nation's biggest financing gap in a private pension fund. General Motors has since taken steps to reduce its obligation, and rising rates have further reduced its liability. The rate increase, """"if maintained, would decrease G.M.'s reported unfunded pension liabilities at year-end 1994 by over $7 billion,"""" the company said in a quarterly report filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under current accounting rules, the discount rate companies use to calculate the present value of their pension plan obligations must reflect rates on long-term corporate bonds. If rates fall,companies must assume that they will have to contribute more to their pension plans because the existing contributions will earn less money in ensuing years."
8/16/1994	G.M. SAYS PENSION BILL MAY BE CUT BY $7 BILLION	"ENOUGH is enough, Tom Abruzzi decided. After two straight years of poor sales at his Oldsmobile dealership on Cross Bay Boulevard in the Howard Beach section of Queens, he reached a decision. No more Good Olds Guy for him. """"Sales dropped from 100 cars to 40 in '89 and '90,"""" said Mr. Abruzzi, who is 65 years old and built his Bond Motors sales, service and parts center as a general contractor in 1966. """"It was part of a general decline in sales. And the costs of operating a dealership had skyrocketed. We had to get out of the business."
8/14/1994	Car Sales Falter, So a Dealer Turns to Development	CADILLAC, the luxury division of General Motors, is experimenting with a new television and print campaign to broaden its reach beyond the aging white men who are its traditional customers. But unlike other marketers who tailor niche ads to fit the perceived tastes of their targets, Cadillac plans to beckon to women and minorities -- buyers who Cadillac says account for 40 percent of the luxury market -- through the same national advertising it uses to lure its tried-and-true buyers.
8/7/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Suburban; Room With a View	BACK in 1986, Texas Monthly declared General Motors' Suburban the National Vehicle of the Lone Star State. It remains an appropriate title. The Chevrolet and GMC Truck divisions sell more Suburbans in Texas than in any other state, probably because the Suburban is a huge vehicle well suited to roaming the Texas range. But the Suburban's popularity knows no geographic or demographic boundaries. Sales are brisk nationwide, running 85,000 to 95,000 a year between the two divisions. But because of limited production capacity, supplies are slim and resale values are high.
8/4/1994	Detroit Pact For Utility	The Detroit Edison Company said today that it had signed a $2 billion contract that would make it the sole power supplier in the Detroit area to the Big Three auto makers until the year 2004. The agreement, which is subject to approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission, covers 54 car-assembly and parts-manufacturing plants, headquarters and design and technical centers here.
8/3/1994	LTV SAID TO GET 10% PRICE INCREASE FROM CHRYSLER	"The LTV Corporation has won a 10 percent price increase for steel sold to the Chrysler Corporation, setting the stage for similar increases from the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, analysts said yesterday. The LTV-Chrysler agreement was reached late Friday and took effect on Monday. """"This is very big for the steel industry,"""" said Jordan Estra, a metals analyst at Merrill Lynch. """"It's probably the biggest increase in 30 years."""" Last year, steelmakers managed to get price increases of about 2 percent from auto makers, Mr. Estra said. This year, booming auto production and a tight supply of steel have put LTV, based in Cleveland, and other steelmakers in a strong position. Chrysler and LTV declined to comment on the contracts, but Mr. Estra and other analysts said they were able to confirm the 10 percent increase with people close to the negotiations."
7/29/1994	Best Quarter Ever: G.M. Earns $1.92 Billion	The General Motors Corporation said today that it made more money in its second quarter than in any three-month period of its history, as yet another automotive earnings record tumbled in the surging American car and truck market. For the quarter that ended in June, G.M. earned $1.92 billion, or $2.23 a common share, more than twice the $889 million it made in the period a year earlier. Rebounding from a loss of $33 million last year, G.M.'s crucial North American operations contributed the most to the bottom line in the quarter, $723 million.
7/17/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1995 Buick Riviera; Haute Couture Coupe In Size Large	BUICK'S Riviera was perhaps the most eye-popping car at the New York Auto Show this year, but when I spotted those sleek 1995 lines, they took me back through more calendars than I care to recall. I was in junior high school when General Motors rolled out the original Riv, and we kids thought it was just about the best thing we'd ever seen.
7/13/1994	Tweaking the Captains of Industry in Prime Time	"Michael Moore, the counterculture film maker who skewered General Motors and its chairman in the mordantly humorous """"Roger and Me,"""" is at it again -- and this time his camera lens has widened to include all of Corporate America. A few weeks ago, Mr. Moore, accompanied by a television film crew, stood outside I.B.M.'s building in Manhattan, his bullhorn aimed toward the office of Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chief executive."
7/7/1994	Japanese Made Gains In June Vehicle Sales	The leading Japanese auto makers posted strong sales and gains in market share in June, driving up total car and light-truck sales for the month despite a weaker performance by the Big Three. Over all, sales sustained the moderate growth they have managed since easing off in May, sticking to a pace that analysts say bodes well for continued slow growth in the economy. Sales of cars and light trucks rose 6.8 percent compared with a strong period a year earlier.
7/3/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Impala SS; Heavy Metal Act Gets an Encore With a 60's Hit	"IT'S a funny thing,"""" a colleague once said to me in Detroit. """"You want to talk cars, you go to the Ford guys. They like cars. But if you want to buy a car, you go to G.M. The company is huge and gray and all that, but those guys turn out some really neat stuff."""" True, even if it is a bit unfair to Ford and the rest, which have had their moments."
7/1/1994	'95 G.M. Prices to Be 2.5% Above Current Levels	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was raising the prices of its 1995 cars and light trucks by an average of 2.5 percent, or $494, above the current prices of its 1994 models.
6/29/1994	At G.M., the Guard Changes But the Strategy Remains	The General Motors Corporation today announced a raft of retirements and promotions aimed at cementing the turnaround of its core North American automotive operations and stimulating its sales internationally. While John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive, stressed that the changes did not signal a shift in direction for the world's largest auto maker, they nevertheless demonstrated a new willingness at G.M. to sacrifice seniority for perceived ability, and to reach outside the company's home-grown ranks of managers.
6/28/1994	F.B.I. Seeks German Help on Lopez	The Federal Bureau of Investigation has asked the German Justice Ministry for assistance in investigating General Motors' assertions that a former executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, committed industrial espionage when he jumped to Volkswagen A.G. in 1993, a ministry official said today. The request by the F.B.I. is the latest twist in a bitter 14-month dispute between the automotive giants over trade secrets.
6/28/1994	G.M. Expected to Name North American Chief	The General Motors Corporation plans to announce on Tuesday the promotion of G. Richard Wagoner Jr., now the chief financial officer and head of worldwide purchasing, to run the company's crucial North American automotive operations, G.M. officials said today. A corporate reshuffling has been expected at G.M. for weeks. Board members met today in New York to consider the appointment, as well as other management changes requested by John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive.
6/28/1994	Big 3 Look at Natural Gas	The Big Three auto makers plan to announce on Tuesday that they have formed a research partnership to lower the cost of making vehicles powered by natural gas. By 1998 the partnership aims to halve the cost of making the tanks that store natural gas, a popular alternative fuel because it costs less and burns cleaner than gasoline.
6/25/1994	Court Rejects G.M. Pickup Coupon Plan	A Texas appeals court threw out a tentative settlement yesterday that would have given $1,000 coupons to owners of the General Motors pickup trucks that are suspected of posing a fire hazard in side-collision accidents, describing the plan as having little value for consumers. The court said that because the coupons could only be applied toward the purchase of a new G.M. pickup, they required current pickup owners to make a substantial purchase to be useful.
6/25/1994	G.M. Plan For Idled Workers	The General Motors Corporation is offering some of its idled hourly workers up to $60,000 to move to four plants where jobs are available. The offer is the latest in a series of attempts by G.M. to plug a perennial drain on its coffers: members of the United Automobile Workers union who draw full wages for not working. The U.A.W. negotiated that benefit as part of a 1990 contract with G.M., to discourage the company from laying off workers.
6/24/1994	Chrysler and Nissan Top Auto Production Survey	The Chrysler Corporation is the most profitable and lowest-cost maker of automobiles in North America, while the Nissan Motor Company's plants are the most efficient, according to a survey released here today. The General Motors Corporation has improved its efficiency the most, gaining almost 12 percent from a previous study for 1992.
6/23/1994	Chief of G.M. Unit to Retire	The General Motors Corporation said today that Robert T. O'Connell, chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, would take early retirement, effective July 1. Mr. O'Connell's positions at the auto maker's finance arm will be eliminated, company officials said. His responsibilities will be assumed by the president of the finance unit, John R. Rines.
6/23/1994	Team Spirit Is New Message at Olds	"Blindfolded, about 30 people -- almost all men, many of them middle-aged and portly, and some worth millions -- stumbled through a pasture here, alternately clutching one another's sweaty hands and feeling ahead for trees or oncoming colleagues. They were Oldsmobile dealers and employees, and over the next two days they would chant, fall backward into one another's arms, balance atop a telephone pole, embrace repeatedly and ultimately make a """"personal commitment to the family of Oldsmobile."""" It would be an emotion-packed, soul-searching period, with the most pecuniary of aims: selling a lot more cars."
6/21/1994	Japan Gives U.S. Cars a 2d Look	After years of being derided as overpriced, defect-prone gas guzzlers, something unexpected is happening to American cars in Japan. They are starting to win some consumer acceptance. Sales of passenger cars made in the United States by Ford, General Motors and Chrysler more than doubled here in the first five months of this year, compared with the period a year earlier, even as overall car sales declined amid an economic slump. The gains follow a 37 percent increase in Big Three imports to Japan in 1993 from 1992.
6/20/1994	Saturn Invites the 'Family' to a Party	"Bill Bierman, who lives in Cottage Grove, Wis., said he would be """"going home"""" when he drives with his family to Spring Hill, Tenn., later this week. In fact, Mr. Bierman will be going to an automobile factory. Debbie Manowski of Juneau, Alaska, said she would attend """"a family get-together."""" In fact, she will be joining a celebration with some 25,000 strangers, including Mr. Bierman."
6/18/1994	G.M. Dealt Setback On Hughes	A Federal judge ruled today that the Hughes Aircraft Company was entitled to only a small fraction of the $3 billion in royalties and back interest that it had sought from the Government in a 21-year-old legal dispute over a satellite-technology patent. The decision marked a setback to the parent company of Hughes, the General Motors Corporation, and could prevent the wave of patent claims against the Government that patent experts had predicted if Hughes had won a larger settlement.
6/14/1994	Judgment Against G.M. Thrown Out on Appeal	The Georgia Court of Appeals, handing the General Motors Corporation a victory yesterday, threw out the verdict of a jury that had awarded $105 million to the family of a teen-ager killed when his G.M.C. pickup truck was struck by another vehicle and exploded into flame. As a result of the ruling, the case will be sent back to a lower state court for retrial. The $105 million jury award against General Motors last year was one of the highest ever in a product liability case.
6/10/1994	G.M. BUYS STAKE IN APPLIED CERAMICS	The General Motors Corporation has purchased an equity interest in Applied Ceramics Inc., a high-technology ceramics company in Atlanta that will supply it with ceramic substrates for emission devices starting in early 1995. The size of the equity stake and the purchase price were not disclosed.
6/7/1994	Sprint and E.D.S. End Deal Amid Contentious Letters	Sprint and Electronic Data Systems said yesterday that they had broken off merger talks, explaining that the two companies had been unable to agree on financial terms. But behind the scenes, recent contentious letters exchanged by Sprint's and E.D.S.'s top executives indicate that deeper mutual differences may have helped scuttle the deal. General Motors, the corporate parent of the computer services company E.D.S., indicated yesterday that it was still willing to spin off the unit even though E.D.S. would not be merging with Sprint.
6/6/1994	Efforts Revive River But Not Mohawk Life	"The St. Lawrence River is clearer than it has been in years. Unsightly sores caused by chemicals have all but disappeared from the bellies and backs of catfish and bass taken from the river. As Francis Jock, a Mohawk fisherman and environmental researcher, sped away from the bank in a small boat to check his nets, he listed other indicators of the river's improving condition. """"The eagles and the hawks have come back,"""" said Mr. Jock, who has spent all of his 52 years along the river's edge. """"I see mink and otter again. And the fish -- they are plentiful, like when I was a child."
6/5/1994	LONG ISLAND JOURNAL	"Mute Sentinel WAITING to be acknowledged, Bill Kain stood meekly before the security guard at the Omni Corporate Center in Mitchel Field. When told that the guard would never acknowledge him because the guard wasn't human, Mr. Kain was dumbfounded. """"But his skin is so real,"""" he said. """"It's unbelievable."""" What is unbelievable is that isn't skin or veins, that cover the body of Art the Guard. Art is art, a sculpture so lifelike that almost everyone who enters the building approaches Art, and not the living-breathing Glynnis Gordon, who sits at a nearby table."
6/2/1994	G.M. to Extend Warranties For Some Used Cadillacs	The Cadillac division of the General Motors Corporation will offer an extended warranty on cars up to five years old in a campaign to prevent a inventory buildup of used cars at dealerships caused by the expiration of two-year leases. Cadillac is the latest luxury car division, following Toyota Motor Corporation's Lexus division and the Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury division and others, to extend warranty coverage or lease terms for used cars as a way to keep inventories low.
6/1/1994	The Strategies Driving An E.D.S.-Sprint Deal	To understand why the long-distance company Sprint is eager to merge with the computer-services provider E.D.S., talk to a potential customer, Jim DiGiore. As the manager of information systems at Empire of America Realty, a mortgage company based in Buffalo, Mr. DiGiore has developed a high-speed computer network that links lending officers in 20 cities. Loan applications, home appraisals and credit reports fly across the network electronically as the company seeks to speed up loan approvals and pull in more business.
5/25/1994	DETROIT DIESEL TO SELL 13% STAKE HELD BY G.M.	"The Detroit Diesel Corporation said yesterday that it would offer for sale 2.9 million shares owned by the General Motors Corporation, representing a stake of about 13 percent. In 1988, General Motors sold Detroit Diesel to Roger S. Penske, the Indianapolis 500 race-team owner, but maintained a stake in the venture. Detroit Diesel said the sale of the stake would not dilute per-share earnings. """"The stock sale of G.M.'s remaining shares of Detroit Diesel is consistent with our strategy to divest our noncore assets and to focus on our core automotive operations,"""" said William E. Hoglund, a G.M. executive vice president and a Detroit Diesel director. Detroit Diesel went public in September. Its stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $25.125."
5/22/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mustang GT vs. Camaro Z28; Topless Style With American Muscle	LEE A. IACOCCA, who was about to leave the top job at the Chrysler Corporation, was shaking his head. This was a couple of years ago, in his sumptuous office in Chrysler's sumptuous New York headquarters, and he was talking about the electric van I had just driven, which didn't work very well. The problem, of course, was the battery technology, ancient and not ready for an unpolluted brave new world in which everyone will drink Perrier and will have stubbed out the final cigarette.
5/21/1994	G.M. Outlines Its Asian Strategy to Shareholders	The General Motors Corporation displayed its strategy today for taking advantage of rapidly expanding Asian markets by building far more cars and trucks there, especially in China. Company executives said that they would begin production in India and Indonesia by the end of the year, and that they were in final negotiations to make mini-vans and subcompact cars in China. These plans, set forth at the company's annual meeting, held here today, mark G.M.'s latest effort to expand its vastly profitable foreign operations even as its North American automotive units pursue the far more modest goal of showing a net profit this year after repeated losses.
5/20/1994	G.M. Expected to Create Top North America Post	The General Motors Corporation is preparing to elevate one of its young executives to a new post, the president of its crucial North American operations, in a sign that it believes its once-collapsing core business has stabilized, people inside G.M. said today. John F. Smith Jr. has had the lead role in stemming billions of dollars of losses in North America since G.M.'s board ejected the company's top managers and installed him as chief executive in November 1992. Now that a vigorous cost-cutting campaign and a realignment of G.M.'s divisions and vehicle-development programs have taken hold, Mr. Smith would prefer to focus on strategic planning for the entire corporation, G.M. executives said.
5/18/1994	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Chevrolet says a single engine can give its 197 dealer ad groups a more powerful voice.	CHEVROLET, in one of the largest efforts ever to consolidate automotive advertising, is encouraging its regional dealer ad associations to work with Lintas Campbell-Ewald, the auto maker's national agency. The eventual goal is to convince most or all of the 197 dealer ad groups to move their accounts from the agencies they now use. That would cost those local and regional agencies an estimated $300 million to $400 million in billings. The intensive campaign, which began in earnest last month, is pitting a giant marketer and its giant agency against 86 smaller shops. So far, the Davids are ahead; there has been a single convert, the Heartland Chevrolet-Geo Dealers Association in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
5/18/1994	Complexity Galore	The merger discussions between the Sprint Corporation and the Electronic Data Systems Corporation assume that at least a year will be needed to tie up all the loose ends with Federal regulators, an executive involved in the negotiations said. Such patience may be a necessity, considering all the dispensations that E.D.S.'s parent, the General Motors Corporation, will be seeking from the Government before a merger can go through.
5/16/1994	Opel Confirms Detectives' Use	The General Motors Corporation's Adam Opel A.G. unit said today that it had hired detectives to tail workers at Volkswagen A.G. because of fears that the VW staff had stolen trade secrets. Opel's statement followed a report in the news magazine Der Spiegel, which said Opel had had VW's purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez, and other workers followed, and that VW had responded by arranging for the Opel detectives to be watched.
5/15/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Lumina; Not Just Another Pretty Face	THERE is nothing objectionable about the 1995 Chevrolet Lumina. In most respects, the vehicle is quite competent. But to my eye, it misses the mark on styling. The new design is not offensive; it is simply bland. Chevrolet officials assert that 2,000 consumers it interviewed ranked styling only fifth in importance, behind price and value, quality, safety, and comfort and convenience. Chevy says the consumers told it that the new Lumina sedan and its two-door sibling -- now called the Monte Carlo -- looked contemporary, sleek, aerodynamic, substantial, high-quality and expensive.But a positive consensus at these consumer clinics does not always indicate acceptance in the real world. For instance, G.M. officials said several years ago that the previous Lumina and its cousins -- the Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix -- would be wildly successful upon their introduction in 1989, based on the reactions of small groups of consumers. In fact, those cars never met sales expectations.
5/12/1994	G.M. Gives Mexico Its Own 'Chevy'	Passionate purple, nail-polish red and swimming pool aquamarine are colors that a growing number of Mexicans have begun to associate with the North American Free Trade Agreement. As soon as the trade pact took effect on Jan. 1. General Motors de Mexico started importing a cuddly new subcompact car from Spain called Chevy in several psychedelic colors. Its arrival has brightened an otherwise dreary automotive sector.
5/11/1994	AUCTION COMPANY BUYING IDLED GENERAL MOTORS PLANT	"The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its idled auto assembly plant in Framingham, Mass., to the Adesa Corporation, a vehicle auction company. The price was not disclosed. Adesa plans to move and expand its current auction site in Acton, Mass., and open the Framingham center in the fall of 1994. Adesa's president and chief operating officer, D. Michael Hockett, said the company had been """"searching for a facility to accommodate the tremendous growth we have experienced"""" since it bought a Boston-area auto auction in November 1992. Adesa, based in Indianapolis, also has locations in Kentucky, Ohio, Alabama, Indiana and Tennessee."
5/10/1994	G.M. Is Again Raising Prices Of Vehicles in Short Supply	The General Motors Corporation announced its second round of price increases in a week today by adding as much as $310 to the prices of another group of popular cars and trucks. As was the case with the G.M. models whose prices climbed last week, the vehicles included this time -- including the Chevrolet Camaro sports coupe and the GMC Jimmy compact sport utility vehicle -- are in high demand and short supply.
5/5/1994	Corporate Designers Enroll In the 'Less Is More' School	"Anything """"New"""" and """"Improved"""" used to have to come in a bigger package. But in this era of landfills that are full and incinerator ash that is treated as hazardous waste, better should mean smaller, according to the Coalition of Northeastern Governors. So the governors, from New England, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, issued a challenge in 1991, and 46 companies accepted: Today, many came to show off what they had done. G.M. Sheds Styrofoam The General Motors Corporation, for instance, told suppliers to stop using Styrofoam dividers inside shipping containers, and either bolt the car components down or use cardboard dividers, which are easier to recycle. That step and others, the company said, cut the amount of landfill waste for each mid-sized car to 13 pounds from 82 pounds in 1991."
4/29/1994	G.M.'s Profit Jumps 66.5% in Quarter	With auto sales booming in North and South America and strengthening in Europe, the General Motors Corporation reported today that its first-quarter profits jumped 66.5 percent from a year earlier, to $854 million. The robust earnings, which at 81 cents a share exceeded the expectations of automotive securities analysts, came despite a previously announced $758 million charge G.M. took to account for benefits for some former employees. Without the charge, G.M., the world's largest auto maker, earned $1.6 billion.
4/26/1994	Saturn Returns to Full Output of Cars	The Saturn Corporation, the tiny auto maker created by the General Motors Corporation to pioneer manufacturing and sales techniques, said today that it had returned to its prior production level of small cars after its sales rose with the industrywide boom. The move clearly puts Saturn in a stronger position as it prepares to seek backing from G.M. for an additional assembly plant in hopes of bolstering its profits. Saturn officials have to demonstrate that they can sell everything they can now build before asking for more production capacity.
4/24/1994	A Pontiac That Shouts While Rivals Whisper	DEAR Sir: Why does General Motors offer four-wheel disk brakes on so few of its cars? This is particularly vexing when considering the many virtues of the Pontiac Bonneville SSEi, which has so many desirable safety features and yet uses drum brakes on its rear wheels.
4/15/1994	G.M. Settles Suit Over Plant Closing	The General Motors Corporation has tentatively settled a lawsuit filed by a Michigan township and county over the closing of an autombile assembly plant last year. Ypsilanti Township and Washtenaw County sued the auto maker after it announced that it would close the plant, known as Willow Run, because of flagging sales of its Chevrolet Caprice and other large rear-wheel-drive cars.
4/13/1994	4 Former Brookhaven Officials Indicted in Bribe Scheme	Four former officials of the Town of Brookhaven have been charged in a Federal indictment with accepting bribes of as much as $250,000 to support a prominent developer's real-estate projects. The indictment, unsealed today, grew out of statements made in September 1992 in Federal court by John McNamara, a car dealer and Long Island developer who pleaded guilty at that time to bilking General Motors out of $436 million in loans by faking the export of tens of thousands of vans.
4/13/1994	Credit Card For Chrysler	"Officials of the Chrysler Corporation said today that the company was working on plans to introduce a credit card to match those of two of its rival auto makers, General Motors and Ford, but that there was no timetable for taking action. """"We can be a little bit more deliberate about it,"""" a company spokesman, Jim Crawford, said. He was responding to an article in USA Today saying that Chrysler, the No. 3 auto maker, would issue the card this fall and that it may offer holders more lucrative rebates than G.M. or Ford do."
4/1/1994	G.M. Recalls 2,500 Natural Gas Pickups	The General Motors Corporation, searching for clues as to why tanks in two natural gas-powered pickup trucks exploded during refilling, offered today to buy back or exchange the approximately 2,500 natural gas pickups it sold in the last two years. G.M. also said it had canceled for now any plans to sell natural gas-powered cars or pickups in the 1994 model year, pending further development of tanks and other equipment.
3/31/1994	ITT Offers New Initiatives That Are Part of Revamping	The ITT Corporation announced several new initiatives yesterday that are part of the company's plan to restructure into more strategically focused businesses. The company said it had signed a definitive agreement to sell ITT Power Systems, its electronic-power-supply subsidiary, to Charter Power Systems Inc. of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., a manufacturer and marketer of batteries and integrated electronic power systems. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
3/30/1994	G.M. PLANS $758 MILLION ACCOUNTING CHARGE	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would take a charge of $758 million, or $1.05 a share, in the first quarter because of the adoption of new accounting standards. Despite the charge, North American operations of the company are still expected to show a profit for 1994, said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., executive vice president and chief financial officer. The noncash charge is related to the adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, which affects extended disability benefits to United States workers. Under the new standard, the cost of the benefits will be accrued during the employees' tenures at G.M. The news came after shares of G.M. closed down $1.375, at $56, on the New York Stock Exchange.
3/29/1994	Japan to End Restraints on Auto Exports to U.S.	Japan announced today that it would discontinue its voluntary restraints on exports of automobiles to the United States when its fiscal year ends on Thursday. The restrictions, an example of what is now called managed trade, were begun in 1981, at a time when American car makers were reeling from Japanese competition. But the end of the program comes as Detroit's Big Three have narrowed the quality gap with Japan and are gaining more of the American market.
3/29/1994	Chicago Agency Chosen by Saturn	The Saturn division of the General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had selected Cooperative Marketing in Chicago as the first agency to handle its retailer-based direct marketing programs. Billings were not disclosed.
3/29/1994	Saturn, G.M.'s Big Hope, Is Taking Its First Lumps	The Saturn Corporation, the upstart auto maker created to revive its parent, the General Motors Corporation, is having a tough time growing up. After a dazzling start, Saturn is grappling with too many unsold cars, a three-year-old design and some new, attractive competitors entering the small-car market. At the same time, it must solve a related and even more difficult puzzle: how to fit in with the often fractious, often cash-short G.M. family of automobile divisions ranging from Cadillac to GMC Truck.
3/29/1994	G.M. Plan to Shift Power To Outside Directors	"In an effort to institutionalize sweeping changes in the governance of the General Motors Corporation during the last two years, G.M.'s board has published a series of guidelines aimed at shifting corporate power from the chief executive to nonemployee directors. The guidelines, which are not binding, propose that the nonemployee directors have """"complete access"""" to G.M. managers instead of having to go through John F. Smith Jr., the auto maker's president and chief executive; that Mr. Smith undergo a formal annual evaluation by the nonemployee directors, and that those directors -- rather than the chief executive -- choose new directors."
3/28/1994	Market Place; Newly Rich Detroit May Conserve Cash and Scrimp on Dividends	Investors who were counting on the Big Three auto makers to pay generous common stock dividends after regaining healthy balance sheets could be disappointed in this season of prosperity in Detroit. Despite recent increases in sales and cash flow, which have propelled the common stocks of Ford, Chrysler and General Motorsto new highs, several auto industry analysts expect auto makers to increase dividends more conservatively than has been their custom.
3/23/1994	G.M. Urges a Halt in Use of Some Pickups	The General Motors Corporation has told owners of about 2,500 compressed natural gas-powered pickup trucks to stop using them, after two tanks ruptured during refueling, injuring employees at two utility companies. A G.M. spokeswoman, Linda Cook, said about 90 percent of the 1992 and 1993 model trucks are used by utility fleets in Texas and California. G.M. is investigating the cause of the accidents with the company that converts the trucks to natural gas, Production Automotive Systems of Troy, Mich., and with Comdyne Inc., a West Liberty, Ohio, company that builds the fuel cylinders for the trucks.
3/18/1994	G.M. Pact Is Ratified in Ohio	Workers at the General Motors Corporation's two Delco Chassis division brake parts plants in Ohio overwhelmingly ratified a new local three-year contract today, ending a three-day strike by 2,900 workers over concerns about job security. Even as the workers were returning to their jobs this afternoon, several more G.M. vehicle assembly plants were forced to halt production as they ran out of brake components. In all, 19,790 G.M. workers at seven G.M. vehicle plants in Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin and Ontario are idled until an adequate supply of parts is assured.
3/18/1994	G.M. Output Of the Saturn Reduced 29%	The General Motors Corporation said today that its Saturn division had reduced its daily output by 29 percent, the first production cut since the small-car subsidiary started operating almost four years ago. The production cut could mean that Saturn officials will delay plans to formally ask G.M. for a second assembly plant. There have been reports for months that G.M. could either build a new Saturn plant or use an existing G.M. factory to increase Saturn's annual capacity, which now stands at 322,000 cars.
3/17/1994	G.M. in Pact With Ohio U.A.W. Local	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union reached a tentative agreement today that may end a three-day strike at two parts plants in Dayton, Ohio. By depriving assembly plants of critical brake parts, the strike had already shut down factories elsewhere, idling thousands of workers. Before the tentative agreement was announced late this afternoon, G.M. had shut a car assembly plant in Lansing, Mich.; a pickup truck assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., and a dump truck assembly plant in Janesville, Wis.
3/17/1994	Heartstrings, not heartbeats, drive Chevy's new campaign.	"BY Chevrolet's accounting, four times in recent history the flagship division of General Motors has """"redefined"""" what Chevrolet means to life in the United States through its advertising campaigns. The first came in the 1950's when Dinah Shore told Americans in song to """"See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet."""" Twenty years later, an oil crisis reminded Americans of the perils of economic dependence, and Chevrolet responded with nationalist pride, advertising itself as an All-American icon, along with baseball, hot dogs and apple pie. Then came the invasion of Japanese cars in the 1980's and more nationalism -- Chevrolets as the heartbeat of America."
3/16/1994	Progress Seen in G.M.'s Talks With Union	Talks broke off late tonight between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union with some progress toward an agreement to end a strike by 2,900 workers at two Delco Chassis brake part plants that could cost G.M. $15 million to $20 million a day in lost income. The negotiations were to resume on Wednesday morning, said Joe Hasenjager, president of the U.A.W.'s local 696.
3/16/1994	Chevrolet Is Seeking To Reclaim Old Glory	With its strong products and canny marketing, the Chevrolet Motor division for decades meant affordable style, power and patriotism for its customers. It also meant big profits for the company it dominated and defined, the General Motors Corporation. So, it was no coincidence that G.M.'s earnings suffered as Chevrolet's image rusted after the late 1970's. Chevrolet sells as many cars and trucks as all of G.M's other divisions combined. But customers just would not buy dull or ugly cars like the instantly forgettable Corsica and that regrettably unforgettable whale, the Caprice.
3/15/1994	G.M. Executive Says He Will Stay Put	Phil Guarascio, general manager of marketing and advertising at General Motors' North American operations in Detroit, put an end yesterday to speculation that he was leaving his post at G.M. after nine years to join Turner Broadcasting Sales.
3/10/1994	G.M. Signs Electric Car Battery Deal	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had signed a partnership agreement with the Ovonic Battery Company to advance the commercialization of a relatively new kind of battery for electric vehicles. The venture with Ovonic, a subsidiary of Energy Conversion Devices, will explore the application of nickel metal hydride batteries for electric vehicles. General Motors would not discuss how much money would be involved.
3/4/1994	Bullish Chrysler Moves To Beef Up Auto Plants	The Chrysler Corporation, bullish about its long-term prospects after introducing several highly acclaimed new car and truck models, said today that it would spend $1.8 billion over three years to increase its manufacturing capacity by 17 percent. Chrysler's move could be among the first of many in spirited jockeying among the Big Three auto makers to capitalize on rising vehicle sales -- particularly of sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans -- over the next two to three years. The Ford Motor Company has been trying to squeeze extra capacity from its assembly lines, especially for its hot-selling utility vehicles and light trucks, and the General Motors Corporation recently announced actions to increase truck capacity. Thousands of New Jobs Chrysler said it was undertaking a series of actions, including canceling its plans to shut down one of its two assembly plants near St. Louis. Over all, Chrysler will increase its worldwide vehicle-making capacity to 3.5 million units a year from about 3 million currently. The increase is expected to generate as many as 6,000 jobs in the United States and Canada, the auto maker said. Some jobs will go to laid-off union members but at least several thousand new workers will be hired.
3/4/1994	JUDGE ACCUSES G.M. OVER PICKUP DATA	"A Federal judge in South Carolina says he believes that lawyers for the General Motors Corporation may have destroyed, or been aware of the destruction of, documents related to a fire-prone G.M. pickup truck that has been the subject of lawsuits. In findings issued on Monday, the judge, G. Ross Anderson Jr. of Federal District Court, said he believed that there had been a """"systematic destruction"""" of documents concerning Chevrolet and G.M. pickups made from 1973 to 1987 that carried dual, side-mounted gasoline tanks. Judge Anderson also said he believed that G.M. lawyers might have lied about the matter."
3/4/1994	Chevrolet to Replace 'Heartbeat' Theme	"Chevrolet will soon introduce a replacement campaign for """"The Heartbeat of America,"""" a theme that has become one of the most familiar in advertising since it began appearing in the fall of 1986. The new campaign, by Lintas Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., will carry the theme """"Genuine Chevrolet."""" """"Chances are that sometime, somewhere, you've probably had a Chevy in your life,"""" says a print advertisement that appears in the April issue of Premiere magazine. """"For more than 80 years, we've been helping people get to the places and people they want to see most."""" The text is accompanied by warm, portrait-style photographs of families."
3/4/1994	Surpassing Predictions, Vehicle Sales Jump 19.8%	Automotive sales shot up 19.8 percent last month, compared with February of last year, exceeding even the optimistic expectations of industry executives, forecasters, retailers and Wall Street analysts. Sales of light trucks were particularly strong as the Big Three auto makers capitalized on their advantages over Japanese competitors in mini-vans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles. But the strong sales, combined with recent price increases by the auto makers, could provoke further moves by the Federal Reserve to ward off inflation.
2/28/1994	Patents	WILL the advent of interactive technology make a home gambling network possible? A Florida inventor is betting it will. Henry Von Kohorn, president of Response Reward Systems, holds several patents for interactive television and radio systems that award coupons or cash prizes to people playing game shows. But so far his inventions are waiting for interactive television to take off. When it does, he hopes armchair gamblers will switch on the television and bet on sporting events, beauty contests or lotteries to win cash or credits for merchandise.
2/19/1994	G.M. Gets an Award From Ford	The General Motors Corporation's Saginaw steering gear division has been cited for high quality and productivity by an unlikely source -- the Ford Motor Company. G.M. said its Plant 21 in Athens, Ala., had been given the Ford Q1 Preferred Quality Award for steering pumps that the plant supplied to Ford. The Q1 Award is given to suppliers that Ford says demonstrate commitment to continuous improvement in quality and productivity.
2/18/1994	G.M. Plant May Reopen	The Saturn division of the General Motors Corporation is considering reopening a shuttered G.M. factory in Michigan to increase its production, according to a published report. Saturn officials have been preparing to make a case to G.M. to open a second plant, arguing that the capacity at Saturn's Spring Hill, Tenn., plant is insufficient to meet demand. Originally, Saturn had hoped to open a new factory in Spring Hill, but the United Automobile Workers union resisted that idea, pushing instead for Saturn to use an idled factory.
2/11/1994	G.M. Posts $2.47 Billion Profit for '93	With demand for cars and trucks growing as its own costs shrink, the General Motors Corporation today reported profits of $2.47 billion for 1993. The company's reviving North American operations posted their first profitable quarter since 1989. For the three months that ended in December, G.M. said it earned $1.18 billion, or $1.28 a share of common stock. In the quarter a year earlier, G.M. had a $651.8 million net loss. For the quarter, sales totaled $37.27 billion, up from $35.55 billion in 1992.
2/6/1994	Will the Big 3 Stay on the Road To Success?	"WHAT a difference a recovery can make in Detroit. Only yesterday, it seems, the Big Three chiefs and President Bush flew to Tokyo complaining about """"getting our brains beaten in,"""" to use Lee Iacocca's vivid expression. Today the Big Three, exemplified by Chrysler's stunning turnaround, are selling cars almost as fast as they can build them. With improved American quality and Japan's higher prices, Detroit's models indeed represent superior value, a claim that is finally holding water."
2/5/1994	G.M. Asks for More Time on Electric Cars	"The General Motors Corporation is sincerely trying to develop an electric vehicle consumers will buy but needs more time than state regulations allow, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive, said today. In a speech here, Mr. Smith appeared to be defending G.M.'s electric vehicle program against assertions in an article in The New York Times on Jan. 28. """"We are not putting our electric vehicle act on the road and planning for a flop, as was implied in one of the news articles last week,"""" Mr. Smith said."
2/4/1994	G.M. Environmental Pact	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest industrial company, has agreed not to damage the environment. The auto maker said yesterday that it would uphold the Ceres principles, once known as the Valdez principles. The standards are a code of conduct created by environmentalists and investment groups after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill on Alaska's coast.
2/4/1994	Auto Sales Jumped 13.8% Last Month	United States automotive sales surged 13.8 percent in January, despite the effects of the Los Angeles earthquake and severe winter weather, suggesting that the demand for new cars and light trucks is outpacing bullish forecasts. Car buyers seem to be moving up their purchases of new cars faster than auto makers and economists had expected. The reasons for this are the high average age of cars and trucks on the road, as well as increases in employment, personal income and consumer confidence.
2/3/1994	COMPANY NEWS; Volkswagen Advances In Its Battle With G.M.	Volkswagen A.G. won another round today in its running legal battle with General Motors when a German civil court ruled that VW had not broken the law by luring away seven former G.M. managers last March. The suit was filed last spring by Adam Opel A.G., G.M.'s German subsidiary. The seven managers left G.M. and Opel to join their former boss, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who abruptly left General Motors in Detroit, where he had been chief of purchasing, in March to head Volkswagen's production and purchasing.
2/3/1994	New Marketing Unit From Leo Burnett	The Leo Burnett Company in Chicago said yesterday that it had formed an interactive marketing group, which will serve Burnett clients including Oldsmobile.
1/31/1994	G.M. Profit May Top Goal for '93	"Saying that the North American operations of General Motors had """"absolutely"""" turned the corner, G.M.'s president and chief executive, John F. Smith Jr., hinted in an interview Saturday that the company's 1993 earnings would beat its own goal. """"The trend in improvement is rather interesting,"""" Mr. Smith said. In the past, he pledged that the North American operations, which lost $17 billion from 1990 through 1992, would break even before interest, taxes and other special charges. But in the interview he said """"we will be black"""" before such charges."
1/28/1994	Expecting a Fizzle, G.M. Puts Electric Car to Test	"General Motors is preparing to put its electric vehicle act on the road, and planning for a flop. With pride and pessimism, the company, the furthest along of the Big Three in designing a mass-market electric car, says that in the face of a California law that requires that 2 percent of new cars be """"zero emission"""" vehicles beginning in late 1997, it has done its best but that the vehicle has come up short. It will cost too much and will not go very far between lengthy visits to a charging station."
1/23/1994	Dummies Get Smarter for Car-Crash Tests	The auto industry, working to sell more cars by selling safety, is about to send something new hurtling down the test track: a pregnant crash dummy. The addition of a woman seven months pregnant to the dummy lineup represents a new era of precision in safety tests by the auto industry, now that improvements like air bags, antilock brakes and energy-absorbing car frames allow people to survive crashes that a decade ago would have killed them. Changes in Research General Motors, the progenitor of the pregnant dummy, is also a sponsor, with Ford and the Federal Department of Transportation, of crash tests on human cadavers. For years, technicians tested how much force it took to break a rib and how much deceleration a body could stand before internal organs were torn loose. Now they study questions like how far a foot can bend in a crushed car before the ankle snaps or the ligaments tear.
1/22/1994	G.M. UNIT TO ACQUIRE STAKE IN VIDEO LOTTERY CONCERN	Video Lottery Technologies Inc. said yesterday that the General Motors Corporation's Electronic Data Systems unit had agreed to acquire a minority stake in the gaming company. Under the accord, the E.D.S. unit agreed to buy 545,454 common shares of Video Lottery for $27.50 a share. The E.D.S. unit will also buy 1,912,728 shares of a newly created series of a nonvoting Video Lottery preferred stock. The companies reached a 10-year technology partnership to expand the gaming company's research and development efforts. Shares of Video Lottery, based in Bozeman, Mont., rose $1.50, to $21.25, in Nasdaq trading.
1/17/1994	G.M. and Union Reach Pact In Strike at Louisiana Plant	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union reached a tentative agreement early this morning that may end a six-day strike at a Louisiana plant that produces one of G.M.'s most popular vehicles. The 2,300 hourly workers at the plant in Shreveport were scheduled to vote on the agreement at 2 P.M. Monday. If the accord is approved, production will resume Tuesday morning, union leaders in Shreveport said.
1/12/1994	Shreveport G.M. Plant Out on Strike	Unable to reach agreement on a local labor contract, the United Automobile Workers union struck a General Motors assembly plant today in Shreveport, La., halting production. The plant manufactures two versions of a popular light pickup truck. Auto industry analysts said the strike would have to continue for at least two weeks before it cut into sales, a prospect that appears unlikely.
1/9/1994	G.M.'s Pension Plan Adds Stock to Cash	"To the Editor: Lawrence White misleads readers about the General Motors Corporation's plan to address its unfunded pension liability in """"G.M.'s Bookkeeping Game"""" (Op-Ed, Dec. 18). Professor White maintains that cash is better than stock, but ignores that G.M.'s stock contribution will be made to supplement billions of dollars in cash contributions to our plans."
1/7/1994	G.M. Forms China Joint Venture on Engine Parts	The General Motors Corporation has formed a joint venture with a Chinese business and a Chinese Government-owned enterprise to make and sell engine-management systems in China, a G.M. executive said today. G.M. already runs a $100 million joint venture to produce pickup trucks in northeastern China and is exploring a joint venture to build mini-vans there. Its parts division has already joined in ventures and signed licensing agreements with Chinese businesses to make and distribute spark plugs, wiring harnesses and other components.
1/6/1994	SATURN HAS BREAK-EVEN RESULTS BEFORE INTEREST	"The Saturn Corporation, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, said yesterday that it had broken even before interest expenses for the first time since it began building cars in 1990. """"Saturn will exceed its break-even and realize a substantial operating profit in 1993,"""" Tom Manoff, vice president for finance at Saturn, said. Saturn said the break-even point excluded the cost of paying interest on $1.9 billion in bonds held by G.M. to build the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. The subsidiary expects to sell between 275,000 and 300,000 cars this year, up from 229,356 in 1993 and 212,000 in 1992."
1/5/1994	An Oldsmobile Option For Self-Navigating Car	Where is the nearest hospital? What is the best way to get from here to West Bloomfield? How far is Tiger Stadium? Today, a driver would have to roll down the window and ask. But later this year the car itself will be able to answer, complete with maps and step-by-step directions -- at least if the car is an Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight LSS, with a $2,000 option called the Navigation/Information System.
1/5/1994	Auto Makers' Sales Rose 8.4% in 1993	The American auto industry finished 1993 on a strong note with sales in December roughly 5 percent ahead of 1992 levels and overall sales for the year up about 8.4 percent. Several foreign manufacturers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, had not finished tallying their numbers late today, preventing an exact accounting. However, sales analysts at the Ford Motor Company estimated total industry sales of 8.6 million cars for 1993 and 5.6 million light trucks for a total of 14.2 million vehicles, the best year since 1989 and up from 13.1 million in 1992.
1/4/1994	Painful Change at G.M. Parts Plants	At a sprawling General Motors factory here, workers making a basic part of the steering system of Saturn cars use five different machines, which for years were scattered through the plant. The workers would toss hunks of metal into bins, then wheel the bins from machine to machine, dodging unrelated assembly lines and machinery on a half-mile amble through the manufacturing process. But as part of G.M.'s seismic shake-up, workers and managers came up with a revolutionary reform: putting the five machines next to each other.
12/21/1993	G.M. DIVISION SELLS AIR PUMP BUSINESS TO COLTEC	The Saginaw division of the General Motors Corporation has sold its mechanical and electric air pump business to Coltec Industries of New York. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Coltec's automotive division will supply G.M. with emission pumps beginning in the second quarter of 1994.
12/18/1993	G.M.'s Bookkeeping Game	What G.M. thinks is good for its bottom line is bad for its pension fund for hourly workers -- and potentially worse for the nation. General Motors owes $24 billion to the fund -- the biggest such obligation of any employer. Last month, it made a seemingly generous offer to reduce the shortfall by contributing $5.5 billion in one class of its common stock to the fund (along with the promise of future cash contributions). But this is just fancy bookkeeping that does not properly address the company's obligations, and Federal regulators should make sure it doesn't happen.
12/17/1993	COMPANY NEWS; Small Setback for G.M. in Feud With VW	Volkswagen A.G. scored a minor victory in its feud with General Motors today, when a German civil court dismissed a request by General Motors for an injunction to block seven former managers from working for Volkswagen. The request was initially filed in May by Adam Opel A.G., the German subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation. The legal action is part of a broader dispute that centers on whether Volkswagen's head of production and purchasing, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, took trade secrets with him when he left General Motors as chief of purchasing in Detroit to join VW in March.
12/15/1993	Conner's Project Gets a Major Backer	"DENNIS CONNER announced in New York yesterday that the Cadillac division of General Motors has agreed to become a major sponsor of his 1995 America's Cup effort. Cadillac is joining Team Dennis Conner as a """"gold-level"""" supporter, which indicates a $3 million contribution in cash and services. Having Cadillac behind him, as it was in Conner's 1992 America's Cup defense, helps to solidify an effort that is expected to cost about $15 million in 1995."
12/9/1993	As a cost-cutter, General Motors consolidates most of its media buying at one group of agencies.	THE General Motors Corporation, in one of the largest consolidations ever of the media functions on an account, has named the Interpublic Group of Companies to handle the buying of about $800 million of the $1.3 billion it spends annually on advertising. G.M., the nation's third-largest advertiser behind Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris, said yesterday that it would assign all national television and radio buying, with billings around $500 million, to a new dedicated unit in New York to be headed by Marc Goldstein, who is now a leading media services executive at the Interpublic agency Lintas U.S.A.
12/7/1993	Big 3 Offer Compromise, Promising Cleaner Cars	In a plan that would sidestep a requirement for electric cars in the Northeast, the Big Three American auto makers proposed a compromise on pollution standards yesterday. General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler offered to produce gasoline-powered cars that would be cleaner than the ones the Federal Government plans to require. But such vehicles would not be as clean as those that meet California's stricter emission standards, which New York and Massachusetts have adopted and other states are considering.
11/28/1993	For Olds, The Import Of Being Different	"PONTIAC has been running some strong television commercials in which it compares its top models with the imports. But it is really Pontiac's sister division, Oldsmobile, that intends to be an out-and-out competitor to the invaders from foreign shores. Behind the move is John Rock, Oldsmobile's general manager, who claims to feel a lot better about the General Motors division now than he did a couple of years ago. At that point, he said, the warehouses were full of his cars and Olds had """"a mixed-bag marketing strategy."
11/27/1993	Study by an Auditor for VW Finds No Sign of Espionage	After weeks of dormancy, Volkswagen A.G.'s trade secrets dispute with the General Motors Corporation revived today as the German auto maker released an auditor's study it had commissioned exonerating the company of industrial espionage accusations. G.M. officials called the report a ruse meant to deceive the public. General Motors contends that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's head of production and purchasing, and seven other former G.M. managers who followed him when he jumped to VW in March, systematically assembled and stole proprietary information.
11/25/1993	THOMSON-CSF TO BUY A HUGHES SUBSIDIARY	The French military electronics company Thomson-CSF reached an agreement yesterday to buy Hughes Rediffusion Simulation Ltd. of Britain. The price was not disclosed. The acquisition would put Thomson in position to challenge CAE Inc. of Canada as the world's No. 1 producer of flight simulation equipment.
11/24/1993	G.M. Sets Sale of 3 Parts Plants	To streamline its parts-making operations, the General Motors Corporation said today that it planned to sell most of its ownership in three plants that manufacture starting motors, generators and other products. G.M. said it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell the plants to Transportation Systems Inc., a group of investors led by Harold K. Sperlich, a former president of the Chrysler Corporation and a well-regarded car and truck developer. The investors also include Citicorp Venture Capital and Mascotech Inc., an automotive components company based in Taylor, Mich. G.M. will own 20 percent of the joint venture.
11/23/1993	Apple Going Into Home Marketing	Apple Computer Inc. will jump into the home-shopping market next month with a compact disk that contains text, sound and images from mail-order catalogue companies like Lands' End, Williams-Sonoma and Tiffany & Company. The disk, called En Passant, includes 21 catalogues from 18 retail companies as well as information on personal finance, video interviews and magazine articles.
11/21/1993	Seeking a G.M. Package That Pleases Everyone	WITH one hand, General Motors last month gave workers at the automotive plant here a brief reprieve, agreeing to keep its assembly lines busy for an extra year before closing for good. With the other, the country's largest auto maker delivered an ultimatum to officials in this Hudson River village: either revoke a precedent-setting local environmental-cleanup law or face legal action. While workers at one of General Motors' oldest plants were relieved to have a year's grace to plan their futures, village leaders bridled at the get-tough legal stance the auto maker had taken with them.
11/20/1993	Toyota Plans To Sell Cars Built by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation signed a first-of-its-kind agreement today under which G.M. will build right-hand-drive Chevrolet Cavaliers in the United States for sale in Japan under the Toyota name. The agreement is the first under which a United States auto maker will sell an American-made car in Japan with a Japanese nameplate, a G.M. spokesman, William J. O'Neill, said. Toyota plans to begin selling the Cavaliers in early 1996.
11/19/1993	G.M. Pickup Case Is Taken Over By the Secretary of Transportation	In an unusual move, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena has personally taken over the case of the General Motors pickup trucks that critics call fire hazards, an agency spokesman said today. But the spokesman, Richard Mintz, denied a report in The Wall Street Journal today that Mr. Pena's action to take the job from the agency staff suggested that the Government might retreat from its earlier request for a costly recall of the 4.7 million vehicles. He said the Secretary was studying several options and had made no decision in the case.
11/18/1993	After the Layoffs, Checks in the Mail	More than a year after the last red Chevrolet Camaro rolled off the assembly line at the General Motors plant northwest of downtown, about 1,200 workers laid off from the plant spend their days sleeping late, watching soap operas, taking classes, planting gardens, working out at the gym and, in one instance, learning to surf. Yet every week they continue to receive paychecks from G.M. Under an unusual provision of the labor agreement between the company and the United Automobile Workers union, the plant's workers will continue to get those checks for up to three more years unless they agree to take a temporary job, move to another G.M. plant hundreds of miles away or opt to retire.
11/17/1993	G.M. Sees Its Results Improving	The General Motors Corporation is ratcheting up the productivity of its workers and expects to turn a profit in its battered North American operations next year, top G.M. officials said today. In meetings with financial analysts and reporters, John F. Smith Jr., the president and chief executive of G.M., said the company was on track to reach its 1993 financial goal of breaking even before charges for interest, taxes and retiree health care expenses. G.M., the largest auto maker in the world, has lost $17 billion in North America since 1990.
11/16/1993	Reshaping Mexico's Auto Future	Of all the Mexican businesses that would be reshaped by a North American Free Trade Agreement, none is more likely to undergo a transformation than the automotive industry. In that sector, a trade accord may well alter the way cars are made and sold on both sides of the border. For Mexico, the stakes are high. Cars are its biggest export business after oil, employing 60,000 people directly and more than 300,000 indirectly in parts manufacturing and distribution. Together, the Chrysler Corporation, the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation, Nissan and Volkswagen built more than a million cars in Mexico last year, making it one of just a few developing countries in the world to reach that mark.
11/16/1993	G.M. Acts to Secure Pensions Using Stock	The General Motors Corporation said this evening that it was asking Federal regulators for permission to use 185 million shares of one class of its common stock to help secure pensions for its hourly workers. Under pressure from regulators, G.M. has been scrambling for a way to reduce its unfinanced pension liability -- the amount it has failed to set aside to pay future pensions. That liability is now about $24 billion, larger than any other corporation's.
11/16/1993	Rally Against Agreement Fizzles Near a G.M. Plant	Was it a case of Nafta fatigue or simply a dose a of spring fever in November? What had been billed as a rally of 3,000 auto workers opposed to the North American Free Trade Agreement turned out today to be a festive affair in which there was ample elbow room for everyone to wave placards. Fewer than 100 people showed up.
11/14/1993	As a Buff, Color Me Cadillac	ALL right, I know I'm supposed to be impartial. But I can't help it; I really like green. And, when I think about it, the cars that have put lust into my heart -- at least the cars that were semi-affordable and therefore almost possible -- have been Cadillacs. Green ones.
11/12/1993	G.M. Gives Its Salaried Staff Raises	The General Motors Corporation, acknowledging unrest among salaried workers about the erosion of pay and benefits, announced a pay package for them today meant to match some gains made by hourly workers represented by the United Automobile Workers union. The package -- $1,600 lump-sum payments for each worker and an average 5 percent salary increase -- was announced on the same day the U.A.W. said it had ratified a new three-year contract with G.M., with 71.5 percent of the members approving the pact.
11/10/1993	COMPANY NEWS; Volkswagen and G.M. Seeking Settlement	At the urging of a German court, Volkswagen A.G. and the General Motors Corporation agreed today to make an attempt at an out-of-court settlement of the civil dispute stemming from the defection in March of seven G.M. managers who followed Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to Volkswagen. The agreement does not affect criminal investigations by German prosecutors and United States Justice Department authorities into G.M.'s assertion that Mr. Lopez, now Volkswagen's chief of production and purchasing, and his colleagues stole trade secrets when they left the company. No charges have been filed, and Mr. Lopez and the others reportedly involved deny any wrongdoing.
11/6/1993	POLICE ARREST 23 IN G.M. DRUG CASE	Twenty-three General Motors assembly line workers have been arrested for dealing cocaine and marijuana in two truck assembly plants, and the police are widening their investigation into drug dealing at other G.M. factories, law-enforcement officials said today. The arrests on Thursday came after a six-month investigation in which an undercover officer, posing as an auto worker, bought drugs from employees as the assembly lines at the two plants rolled by. The plants, just north of here in Pontiac, Mich., produce sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
11/6/1993	Aimee Mott Butler, Philanthropist, 91	Aimee Mott Butler, a philanthropist who was a daughter of a founder of the General Motors Corporation, died on Thursday at her home in St. Paul. She was 91. The cause was complications after a stroke, said a son, Peter Butler of St. Paul.
11/5/1993	Settlement Backed in Texas on G.M. Pickups	A Texas state judge approved a settlement on Tuesday under which the General Motors Corporation will give $1,000 coupons to 645,000 owners of older pickups that Federal safety officials say may pose a fire hazard. The settlement resolves a class-action lawsuit bought in 1992 on behalf of Texas owners of full-size G.M. pickups built between 1973 and 1987. The plaintiffs claimed that the fire risks posed by the vehicles' side-mounted fuel tanks had reduced their resale value. A similar case involving 5.7 million G.M. pickup owners nationwide is pending in Federal court in Philadelphia.
11/2/1993	Pension Funds Join in Turnaround Venture	The California, New York State and General Motors pension funds have quietly agreed to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a venture meant to cash in on corporate turnarounds. Their partnership demonstrates that big investors, having overthrown several of the most prominent corporate chiefs this year, intend to expand their role in managing the companies as well. The venture, sponsored by Dillon, Read & Company, the investment bank, plans to win pledges from several foundering companies to make cutbacks and changes, then buy at least 10 percent of their stock and install one of the venture's partners on each of their boards.
10/29/1993	G.M. Has $113 Million Loss, Beating Wall St. Predictions	The General Motors Corporation said today that it lost $113 million in the third quarter, compared with a $1.1 billion loss a year earlier, as red ink from its struggling North American auto operations overwhelmed profits earned abroad. The loss was smaller than Wall Street had expected, particularly since G.M. reported Monday that it would take a $950 million charge against its earnings for the quarter, or $589 million after taxes, to pay laid-off workers. The loss equaled 49 cents per share of common stock; G.M. shares, which had already climbed more than 9 percent since Monday's close on the New York Stock Exchange, rose further on the news.
10/29/1993	Benefits in New G.M. Pact	The tentative three-year labor agreement negotiated between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers last weekend includes generous inducements for laid-off workers to move to other plants and for older ones to retire. The details emerged today as 400 U.A.W. local leaders overwhelmingly approved the contract, which must still be ratified by the 265,000 U.A.W. members who work for G.M.
10/27/1993	G.M. Tells Plant It Will Delay Date Of Closing	General Motors gave its car assembly plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., a brief reprieve yesterday, saying it would continue operating as much as a year beyond its scheduled 1995 closing date. But G.M. said that it still planned to close the plant as soon as full production of a 1996 mini-van model began elsewhere, and that employment at North Tarrytown until then would depend on sales of the Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Transport mini-vans assembled there.
10/26/1993	G.M. Joins In Rising Auto Sales	Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America climbed 18.4 percent in mid-October, auto makers reported today, helped by a rebound for the General Motors Corporation from earlier production difficulties. G.M. had contended for about a month that its relatively lackluster sales were a result of production slowdowns caused by problems with parts suppliers. But because auto makers often blame everything but the quality of their cars and trucks for slack sales, some analysts had regarded G.M.'s excuse with skepticism -- until today.
10/26/1993	Jury Inquiry Into Lopez	A Federal grand jury here is examining evidence that an executive of the General Motors Corporation took company secrets with him when he defected to Volkswagen A.G. last spring, lawyers for the executive and Volkswagen said today. Justice Department officials said they could not confirm or deny this, but they have confirmed that the department is investigating whether the executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura, systematically looted trade secrets when he left G.M., where he was purchasing chief, for Volkswagen in March. German justice officials are also investigating.
10/26/1993	G.M.'s Pact Disappoints Wall Street	Wall Street expressed its disappointment today with the three-year labor contract tentatively reached on Sunday between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers as shares of G.M. fell sharply. An announcement by the company after the stock market closed today bodes more woes for the stock on Tuesday. General Motors said it would take a $950 million pretax charge against third-quarter earnings to add to its reserves for plant closings.
10/25/1993	Auto Workers Gain Contract With G.M. Increasing Pensions	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers tentatively agreed early this morning to a three-year labor contract that raises wages, enriches pensions and preserves health care benefits that are fully paid by the company. The agreement, reached at 1 A.M. after a 16-hour bargaining session, hews to the pattern negotiated at the Ford Motor Company five weeks ago, the president of the union, Owen F. Bieber, announced. The Chrysler Corporation agreed to a similar contract on Oct. 1.
10/24/1993	IDEAS & TRENDS: A Genteel Conspiracy Theory; Is It Just Possible That Ford Wants to Beat G.M.?	TO hear normally buttoned-up auto industry analysts sound like conspiracy buffs surveying the grassy knoll, ask them this: Is the Ford Motor Company quietly trying to overtake the hobbled General Motors Corporation and become the No. 1 automaker in the United States? Odd that the question should have to be asked. In other industries, companies like Pepsi, Avis, Apple and United make no bones about their eagerness to knock off the big guy. But one of the peculiar aspects of relations among the Big Three automakers is that they are publicly quite genteel. Perhaps because they focus their hostility on the Japanese, no one here talks much about crushing the domestic competition and becoming No. 1.
10/22/1993	No Settlement, or Deadline, For G.M. and Auto Workers	The delicate labor contract negotiations between the United Automobile Workers union, which is trying to preserve an industrywide pact, and the General Motors Corporation, which is pressing for concessions, have reached a strangely upbeat standoff with no agreement but also no strike deadline. Both sides have been predicting an imminent settlement for a week. So far, G.M. has agreed to most of the basic package of wages and benefits in the pattern-setting contract negotiated with the Ford Motor Company last month, Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, told union leaders today in a closed meeting. But G.M. is still haggling over two expensive and complex issues: pension benefits and job security funds.
10/21/1993	A Clean-Air Minuet	General Motors and the air pollution chiefs of 12 Northeastern states are engaged in a double-or-nothing gamble over what emission standards will be applied to cars in the region at the turn of the century. The car company is rolling the dice in the courts and lobbying in legislatures for weaker rules, as state officials consider running to the Clinton Administration to lay down the law to enforce the strictest standard available. But for the first time in a long battle between Detroit and the state capitals, the two sides are approaching negotiations.
10/20/1993	States, G.M. Vie on Car Emissions	"The General Motors Corporation and the air pollution officials of 12 Northeastern states are maneuvering warily in rival attempts to determine what emission standards will apply to cars sold in the region in the late 1990's. The state officials, meeting yesterday in Mystic, Conn., took a step toward asking the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to require """"low emission vehicles,"""" similar to those mandated by California, in their region, which runs from northern Virginia through Maine."
10/16/1993	Ford Reaches Accord on U.A.W. Pact	The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union have settled a last-minute dispute about a holiday provision in their new labor pact, and now plan to sign the contract, officials on both sides said today. The agreement clears the way for negotiators to wrap up industry bargaining at the General Motors Corporation, where the union has been seeking to replicate the pattern contract it negotiated at Ford last month. G.M. appears likely to accept the basic package of wages and benefits, with some modifications.
10/14/1993	COMPANY NEWS: An Experiment for 1,000 Drivers; Sparking Interest In G.M.'s Electric Car	Want to be the first on your block to try out an electric car? Or, put differently, want to try out an electric car that cost as much as your house did, without having to pay for it? Then watch for an insert in your next utility bill.
10/12/1993	Reviews/Television; Diagnosing the Clank Inside G.M.'s Engine	"Having endured a faltering Chevrolet some years ago, I considered recusing myself from reviewing """"The Heartbeat of America,"""" but this scathing account of the breakdown of General Motors reassures me that my ordeal was not singular. (Anyway, I had similar problems with a Plymouth and a Dodge.) To find a favorable word for the world's biggest industrial company, you might have to go to Roger Smith, who retired in 1990 with a pension of more than $1 million a year after taking his company on a very bumpy ride. Mr. Smith's management does not pass the inspection of tonight's 90-minute documentary, which opens a new season of """"Frontline."""" But the deeper sources of the auto maker's distress are located in the supercharged 1950's, when even lemons could make money. A dimwitted cocksureness seems to have been the style of executives blindsided by the advent of small foreign cars. Their crash effort to catch up produced the Corvair, made famous by Ralph Nader in """"Unsafe at Any Speed."""" As Ross Perot, who had his own brief collision with General Motors, observes, """"Success breeds arrogance and complacency,"""" and he should know."
10/11/1993	Essay; Son Of Synfuels	Who is the most powerful business executive in the United States today? She is Dr. Mary Good, President Clinton's Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, who has quietly been designated czar of the U.S. automobile industry. The heads of her divisions -- G.M., Ford and Chrysler -- are delighted with the Government's friendly takeover. These newly middle managers no longer bear responsibility for R.& D., can relax about antitrust, and can forget about the old competition among one another and from abroad. Fatigued by the stress of capitalist risk? Dr. Good will see you now.
10/8/1993	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; In 'Demolition Man,' a car could be your grandson's Oldsmobile.	"AN auto maker with a glorious past is using a film of the present to reassure consumers that it has a future. When Warner Brothers opens """"Demolition Man"""" today at more than 2,000 theaters nationwide, moviegoers watching Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes play cop and robber in the year 2032 can see the results of an unusual product placement promotion by the Oldsmobile division of General Motors. Rather than simply helping to sell more cars, the promotion is intended to burnish the images of Oldsmobile and G.M. by linking them to the presumed technological wonders of tomorrow."
10/8/1993	Blissful Ignorance in Detroit	Neither the next chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander J. Trotman, nor the man he is to replace, Harold A. Poling, owns an automobile. They drive company cars. This revelation does not explain Detroit's slump in the 1970's, nor its buoyant comeback in the 1990's. But it bespeaks an alarming indifference to one of the basics of consumer research -- namely, to know something about consumers, it helps to be one. For those unfortunates who don't have a company car, here's how it works. You get a new one every year. If it goes on the fritz, another one magically appears. You never have to visit a showroom, haggle with a dealer or face the awful truth that what you thought would be a simple tune-up is, in fact, a $500 transmission job.
10/1/1993	U.S. Seeks Less Risk In Pensions	"Seeking better protection for the retirement benefits of millions of American workers, the Clinton Administration proposed legislation today to strengthen the Government's system of pension insurance by requiring companies with insufficient funds in their pension plans to make larger insurance contributions. """"The financial future of many American workers and retirees may be at risk because their pensions are underfunded,"""" Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said at a briefing to explain the proposal, developed by a task force he appointed soon after taking office early this year."
10/1/1993	G.M.'s Canada Contract Sends Shares Falling	Shares of the General Motors Corporation slid today in heavy trading as investors reacted to news of a tentative labor contract reached Wednesday night by G.M. and the Canadian Automobile Workers. The stock closed down $2.125 a share at $41.75. It was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with 7.8 million shares changing hands.
9/29/1993	Washington Joins Big 3 Auto Venture	"The White House and the Big Three auto companies will announce today a radical new approach to car technology and Government-industry relations, under which Washington will give Detroit technology that originated in weapons programs, and Detroit will strive to build a car that goes three times farther than current models on the same amount of fuel. Washington is already working with the auto makers on various technologies, but the new agreement, to be announced at a White House ceremony with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, will set a unifying 10-year goal: very high fuel economy that far exceeds the regulatory requirements. 'Rewriting the Book' """"We think it's an enormous breakthrough,"""" Mr. Gore said of the partnership in a telephone interview last night. """"The goal has been consciously set at a point that lies beyond what we know how to do with current systems."
9/29/1993	Parts Production Debated in Chrysler Talks	Facing a strike deadline of 11:59 P.M. Thursday, negotiators for the Chrysler Corporation are trying to fend off demands by the United Automobile Workers union that the company keep making the same proportion of its vehicle parts in-house, thus preserving and possibly creating jobs. The U.A.W. imposed the deadline on Monday, as a way to focus Chrysler's attention and speed up the talks, union officials said. Both sides said negotiators were likely to agree on a new contract without a strike.
9/29/1993	Slimming Further, G.M. Is Selling Delco Units	On the eve of a new national labor agreement, General Motors today said it was selling 80 percent of its $760 million motors and actuators manufacturing units to ITT, a move meant to conserve capital and eventually to curb G.M.'s spiraling wage and benefit costs. If the sale goes through, it would be the second big divestiture G.M. has made in 11 days. The company said on Sept. 17 that it would sell five parts plants and the assets of a sixth to an investor group led by Richard E. Dauch, a former Chrysler Corporation manufacturing executive.
9/25/1993	For G.M. and Union, It Is a Matter of Jobs	At least a week before the bargaining begins in earnest, the goals of the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union for their new labor contract are coming into focus: The U.A.W. wants to preserve jobs; G.M. wants to shrink its blue-collar work force. These aims are more compatible than they may seem. To continue to employ U.A.W. workers, the union recognized long ago, G.M. must become leaner. The prickly issues instead are how deep -- and how fast -- the nation's No. 1 auto maker can cut.
9/23/1993	G.M.'s CADILLAC DIVISION SEES 9% SALES RISE IN 1994	The Cadillac division of the General Motors Corporation expects to sell 231,200 cars in 1994, up about 9 percent from an estimated 211,500 this year as it introduces its first new DeVille sedan since 1989. Cadillac expects much of the increase to come from the redesigned DeVille, which has traditionally been the division's best-selling model. There are about 819,000 people driving DeVilles between two and seven years old who may be ready for a new car, John O. Grettenberger, Cadillac's general manager, said at the preview yesterday for the division's newest models.
9/21/1993	U.A.W. Sights Are Now Set On Bargaining at Chrysler	Having negotiated a tentative three-year labor contract with the Ford Motor Company, the United Automobile Workers will seek to replicate it at the Chrysler Corporation before moving on to the industry's financially troubled giant, the General Motors Corporation, Owen F. Bieber, the president of the U.A.W., said today. The decision was expected, because if the U.A.W. locks up agreements with both Chrysler and Ford, it will have greater bargaining leverage with G.M., which is expected to put up the biggest fight to alter the agreement to suit its needs.
9/19/1993	A Couple More Nudges for G.M.	"To the Editor: Regarding """"Bringing a Slow-Moving Auto Giant Up to Speed"""" (Sept. 5), I agree with the 10 suggestions for reviving General Motors, particularly numbers 4 (""""End class distinctions among the employees"""") and 5 (""""Make pay more equitable""""). However, as someone who has purchased 41 autos since I started driving in 1956, I would like to add two more suggestions:"
9/19/1993	A Couple More Nudges for G.M.	"To the Editor: Underlying all of the major points in your article is a corporate malaise that can be described charitably as myopia and less charitably as deception. The issue is best illuminated by G.M.'s assumptions relating to its targeted return on its pension fund. Unless G.M. addresses its underfunded pension obligations (which are presently more than double its net worth) and then applies a reasonable target for its net return (rather than the present pie-in-the-sky 10 percent), it will face a crisis of finance and confidence that in retrospect will make its present """"challenges"""" seem like huge opportunities. May they get up to speed soon. SAMUEL J. SALKIN Anchorage, Sept. 9"
9/18/1993	G.M. to Sell Parts Plants to Newly Formed Group	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell five parts plants and the assets of a sixth to an investor group headed by a former Chrysler manufacturing executive, Richard E. Dauch. Terms of the proposed transaction, which is to be completed by Dec. 31, were not disclosed.
9/18/1993	Health Cost Payment in Ford Pact	The tentative labor contract negotiated this week between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union contains a provision under which workers would forgo a small portion of their wage increases partly to help pay for their health care. According to one estimate, the change could be worth about $180 million to Ford over the life of the three-year contract, and $400 million to the General Motors Corporation should a comparable provision be negotiated there. Last year, Ford spent $1.5 billion on health care for its blue-collar workers.
9/17/1993	Detroit Seeks to Monitor Japan's U.S. Auto Sales	Detroit's Big Three auto makers have quietly asked the Clinton Administration to set up an elaborate system for monitoring the prices and sales of cars and trucks imported from Japan and are threatening to seek steep tariffs on the imports if the Administration turns them down, three people involved in the issue said today. The auto industry's request is the latest step in Detroit's yearlong effort to win Government help against Japanese competition. The latest request is based on the rapid appreciation this year of the yen, which gives the industry a fresh argument to try to win tariffs on imports by filing complaints with the Commerce Department.
9/17/1993	For Ford, a New Contract but Little New Ground	Abandoning efforts to frame a fundamentally different agreement with the United Automobile Workers, the Ford Motor Company reached a tentative three-year contract with the union late on Wednesday that increases wages and preserves benefits, including health care fully paid by the auto maker. The few changes appeared more likely to benefit Ford than the industry's ailing giant, the General Motors Corporation, with which the U.A.W. will seek a similar agreement in coming weeks.
9/16/1993	COMPANY NEWS; G.M. Agrees To The Sale Of Allison	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its Allison Gas Turbine division to a group of managers and the private investment firm of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The all-cash transaction, which is expected to close soon, was valued at about $300 million by a person familiar with the deal.
9/15/1993	Chevrolet Makes a Clean Break	Chevrolet said yesterday that it would end its agreement with Ilmor Engineering Ltd. to build race engines for the PPG Indy Car World Series at the end of the 1993 season. JIM PERKINS , general manager of General Motors Chevrolet division, said escalating costs prompted the decision.
9/14/1993	Retirees Figure Big in Detroit Math	If one man reflects the hopes of the nation's automobile workers and the fears of its auto makers as they haggle over this year's labor contract, he could well be J. D. Dotson. Mr. Dotson, 92, has richly enjoyed himself since retiring from the General Motors Corporation in 1967. Come hunting season, he still bags his limit of deer, or at least claims to. He still travels, to northern Michigan or to visit his son in Los Angeles.
9/13/1993	G.M.'s Return Signals Revival for Argentina	Fifteen years ago General Motors left Argentina, fed up with coups, military governments and economic policies that produced only inflation and instability. For Argentina, the closing of G.M.'s two plants was more than just the departure of a giant foreign corporation. It symbolized industrial descent, a country abandoned by most international businesses. But things change, and G.M. has now come back to Argentina.
9/13/1993	Thieves Discover Yet Another Tempting Car Part: the Computer	"When Elizabeth Eppich saw that a thief had smashed the window in her mother's 1987 Chevrolet Eurosport, she feared she would find a gaping hole and torn wires where the radio had been. For a moment, she was relieved: Only the bottom section of the dashboard appeared disturbed. But when she tried to start the car, nothing happened. Then Ms. Eppich, a 21-year-old legal secretary who lives in Queens, realized all too well what the thief had been after. """"Someone took the computer chip,"""" she said in disgust. """"Last year, the same thing happened when somebody stole the computer out of my father's car."
9/12/1993	G.M. Offers To Extend Payments For 2 Years	GENERAL MOTORS has offered to continue local payments worth an estimated $5 million for two years after it closes its auto-manufacturing plant here in order to avoid complying with a recently enacted tough environmental cleanup regulation. Among other things, the law -- adopted by the village five months ago -- would hold the automaker responsible for any pollution to the Hudson River, which is next to the 2.5- million-square-foot assembly plant.
9/12/1993	Conversations/Douglas A. Fraser; He Always Gets Restless When the Union Is Bargaining	"THEY have no sense of strategy!"""" thunders Douglas A. Fraser, former president of the United Automobile Workers and a skilled negotiator, watching the Big Three negotiate new three-year labor contracts with auto workers in this country and Canada. The immediate object of his ire is his longtime employer, the Chrysler Corporation, which, he argues, frittered away a precious bargaining chip by announcing before negotiations began that it would expand a plant in Canada."
9/6/1993	Auto Talks Hang on Health Costs But Workers Are Loath to Chip In	Since learning last year that he had multiple sclerosis, Andy Torok has become less and less steady on his feet, and his worries have accumulated along with the hand prints on his apartment's white walls. But as Mr. Torok has shuttled among specialists, sampling different steroids and undergoing test after test, he has not had to give a single thought to how much his health care costs.
9/5/1993	Bringing a Slow-Moving Auto Maker Up to Speed	AT any other company a quarterly net profit of $889 million would be cause to open champagne. Not so, at the General Motors Corporation. A reversal of horrendous losses, attributable mostly to a recovering United States economy and earnings from nonautomotive subsidiaries, surely was welcome when G.M. announced its second-quarter earnings this summer. Yet the biggest company in the country is by no means out of the woods. Despite cost-cutting, it remains slow, insular and ill prepared to contend with competitors like the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and even the much smaller, weaker Chrysler Corporation.
9/4/1993	VW Supervisory Chief Backs Lopez	The supervisory-board chairman of Volkswagen A.G. indicated his support today for the company's embattled chief of production, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, saying the board had found no evidence that the Spanish executive was guilty of industrial espionage. The General Motors Corporation and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel A.G., have charged that Mr. Lopez -- and seven former G.M. employees who followed him when he jumped to Volkswagen in March -- systematically gathered and stole trade secrets, including the design for a new small car and extensive price lists for parts.
9/2/1993	Honda to Hold Base Price on Accord Model	Honda is maintaining the base price of its new 1994 Accord family sedan at $14,330 -- the same as the current model -- which could provoke protectionist pressure by the Big Three auto makers, which say they expect Japanese car makers to raise prices to reflect the stronger yen. Preparing to defend against possible attacks by Detroit's auto makers, Honda executives and engineers here explained today how they cut costs to avoid a price increase on the stripped-down Accord, modestly raised prices on other models and still expect to remain profitable.
8/31/1993	G.M. Said to Start TV-Buying Review	The General Motors Corporation has begun a long-expected move to consolidate the media services on its $1.4 billion advertising accounts by placing in review its national television-buying budget, advertising executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said yesterday. The executives, in confirming a report this week in Adweek, said the review had started with the assignment to buy $500 million to $600 million in network, cable and syndicated television commercial time. It involves three G.M. media agencies: the Leo Burnett Company, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Lintas Worldwide. Once the review is completed, the report said, G.M. is expected to turn to consolidating its print-buying assignment, with billings estimated at more than $250 million.
8/31/1993	Union Settles on Ford as Target in Contract Talks	"The United Automobile Workers union picked the Ford Motor Company today to be the lead company in negotiating a new basic labor contract with the Big Three auto makers. In choosing the No. 2 auto maker over the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation, the union settled on the financially strongest American auto maker, indicating that it has little interest in giving back gains it has made on issues like health care benefits and job security. That is bad news for G.M., which is in worse shape than Ford and had hoped to lead the negotiations, a position that might have allowed it to tailor the industry's contract to reduce its own burdens. Resistance Expected at G.M. Indeed, the selection of Ford caused some analysts today to predict that G.M., which can ill afford the new pension benefits or job-security provisions the union wants, will resist significant parts of whatever Ford and the union hammer out. That could make it more difficult for the union to preserve its """"pattern bargaining"""" tradition, and perhaps provoke a strike at G.M."
8/30/1993	Auto Union Set to Aim at One of Big Three	Douglas A. Fraser, the former president of the United Automobile Workers, vividly remembers the moment his union discovered it could no longer squeeze more money and benefits out of the nation's auto makers by playing one off another during contract negotiations. It was 1958, and the auto makers were presenting their three-year contract proposals to the union in different locations at the same time.
8/29/1993	Saturns And Such	WHEN it comes to buying cars, I am a slow study. I dither. I think about my wallet and shift from foot to foot. I go away and come back, and the whole thing takes a while. But a surprising number of people are like my friend Joe Burke, who told me three weeks ago that he had to have a car right now. Instantly. When he turned the wheel of his old car, Joe said, the vehicle only sort of ambled in that direction. Dangerous, he said, and he didn't want his wife, Gladys, driving it.
8/28/1993	G.M. Sells Its Lotus Group to Bugatti	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had sold its Group Lotus subsidiary and Lotus Cars U.S.A. to the Italian auto maker Bugatti International S.A.H. for an undisclosed sum. G.M. bought Group Lotus and Lotus Cars U.S.A. in 1986 for about $32 million. Discussions to sell the British engineering and sports car maker started in the fall of 1992, a spokesman for the company said. It used Lotus's engineering expertise for its Adam Opel subsidiary in Germany and its North American vehicle operations.
8/27/1993	VW's Offices Are Searched; Support for Lopez Is Hedged	German prosecutors searched the offices of Volkswagen A.G. today, looking for proprietary information that may have been taken from the General Motors Corporation by VW's embattled chief of production and purchasing, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. The searches, which began early this morning, come as support for Mr. Lopez within Volkswagen appeared to be softening. Klaus Liesen, the company's supervisory-board chairman, indicated in a newspaper interview published today that his support for Mr. Lopez was not unconditional.
8/24/1993	Cars That Are Not Are Hot	"The Big Three's singular ray of sunshine these days comes from the mushrooming popularity of noncar cars: the pickups, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles that are classified by the Government as """"trucks"""" for purposes of energy and safety regulations. Because trucks are one of the few segments that Japanese rivals have been slow to exploit and because they are more profitable than cars, Detroit's auto makers are devoting ever more money and thought to developing them and to thinking about the reasons they are so popular."
8/24/1993	G.M. Is Silent On Consolidation	"The General Motors Corporation declined yesterday to confirm reports in trade publications that it was accelerating plans to consolidate the media services on its $1.4 billion advertising accounts. """"We don't have any announcement to make at this point,"""" said John Maciarz, a G.M. spokesman in Detroit. He repeated his statement when asked to discuss the reports in Adweek and Mediaweek that G.M. would follow the Chrysler Corporation by forming a stand-alone subsidiary to handle media services that would be staffed by executives from its various agencies."
8/22/1993	G.M. Tests a New Marketing Tactic: Head-On Collisions	THE General Motors Corporation, which was once the envy of the industrial world, is now trying to prove that it isn't the patsy of the automotive industry anymore. In Europe, the company is waging a legal and public relations assault on a former executive it accuses of passing secrets to Volkswagen A.G. Back home, its aggressive reaction to a report that one of its pickup trucks was prone to burst into flames helped lead to the resignation of a network news chief.
8/21/1993	Corrections	A report in the News Summary on Thursday about a North Carolina eye clinic's plan to sue NBC misstated what NBC News producers have said about a broadcast last fall on fires in General Motors trucks. They have acknowledged that the network's contractors placed incendiary devices under G.M. trucks that were videotaped for the broadcast. But they have not said those devices actually caused the fires shown.
8/19/1993	G.M. and VW: A Summer Laff Fest	Ever since the Investment Banker Follies lost their appeal, it's been hard to find diverting entertainments of the commercial sort. But Volkswagen and General Motors have been trying hard to fill the gap. It seems the two wounded auto giants have something in common besides difficulty in competing with the Japanese. They have settled on a Basque engineer named Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as the King Midas of small-car profitability. Mr. Lopez had turned G.M.'s Opel into a money maker in Europe. VW, which loses money every time it sells a Golf, set out to woo him. The story has everything, including pork-barrel politics. G.M. had reneged on fulfilling Mr. Lopez's boyhood dream by building a super-modern auto plant in his hometown in Spain.
8/18/1993	New Meetings In Auto Dispute	The German Economics Minister, Gunter Rexrodt, will meet representatives of the German car makers Volkswagen A.G. and Adam Opel A.G., a unit of the General Motors Corporation, in an effort to defuse a dispute over accusations of industrial espionage involving the Volkswagen purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. A ministry spokeswoman said Mr. Rexrodt would meet with Volkswagen representatives later this week. Mr. Rexrodt was meeting today with representatives of Opel.
8/16/1993	Magazine Sees VW-Lopez Rift	"The weekly news magazine Der Spiegel has reported that Volkswagen A.G., contrary to its official statements, is considering the dismissal of its controversial cost-cutter Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. In its Monday issue, which was made available ahead of publication, Der Spiegel reports that Klaus Liesen, the chairman of VW's supervisory board, is secretly """"already thinking about replacing Lopez."
8/15/1993	Spring Hill Journal; Rural Town Ages Rapidly Under Saturn's Influence	"For its first 176 years, Spring Hill was known for -- well, as Charlie Brown, the buildings superintendent, says, for """"nothing."""" Then, in 1985, the Saturn Corporation, a new unit of General Motors, announced that it would build a plant at the south end of town to produce spiffy new cars in a newfangled way, and suddenly Spring Hill became a dot on the map. A good map."
8/11/1993	Engine Fires Prompt G.M. to Issue Recall Of 80% of Saturns	The Saturn Corporation, General Motors' effort to compete against inexpensive Japanese imports in both quality and price, is voluntarily recalling 80 percent of all cars it has ever made to address an electrical problem that has caused engines in at least 34 Saturns to catch fire. Both G.M. and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say there have been no reports of injury or death related to the defect.
8/10/1993	Chevrolet Moves Into China	"The trade-secrets dispute between Volkswagen A.G. and the General Motors Corporation took a new twist over the weekend as the German auto maker made the admission that former G.M. employees who jumped to VW had destroyed documents belonging to the American company after severing their ties to it. But Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a spokesman for Volkswagen, insisted today that neither Volkswagen nor its employees had been in possession of General Motors trade secrets. The former G.M. employees had """"destroyed their own materials from their activities at their previous employer,"""" he said, """"to avoid the danger of spreading them at Volkswagen."""" The company did not name the employees involved. Almost Daily Accusations The notion that the destruction of documents was a benign, personal matter is another strange turn in the increasingly melodramatic battle over trade secrets between the largest car makers in Europe and the United States. During the last two weeks, the companies have publicly traded accusations and insults on an almost daily basis."
8/9/1993	G.M. Papers Destroyed, VW Admits	An article last Sunday about plans to close the automobile showroom in the General Motors Building referred incorrectly to the presence of G.M. dealerships in Manhattan. Although a dealership partly owned by the racing-car team owner Roger S. Penske was the only G.M. sales location in Manhattan when it closed in 1991, G.M. cars continued to be leased by Potamkin Leasing. In addition to the leasing showroom, there are now two sales locations, operated by Potamkin Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet.
8/8/1993	CORRECTION	"Before they had toured the models, before they had even read the brochures, they had heard of John Mc Namara. The name was a source of reassurance as they struggled with whether to buy -- in some cases, to invest their life savings -- in the Highlands, a condominium complex nestled in the hills above Long Island Sound. """"Two years ago, you mentioned the name McNamara, it was like mentioning God,"""" said Jerry Reda, president of the homeowners' association at the development. """"Everyone here bought here because of his name and reputation."
8/8/1993	In Paradise Built by Now-Bankrupt Developer, Anxiety Reigns	After hours of intense discussion, Volkswagen A.G.'s supervisory board and top management closed ranks late tonight in support of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the auto maker's production chief, who is accused of industrial espionage by his former employer, the General Motors Corporation. At an extraordinary meeting of Volkswagen's supervisory board, Mr. Lopez reiterated his version of the trade-secrets dispute, saying that he did not steal or take trade secrets with him when he jumped from G.M. to Volkswagen in March.
8/7/1993	COMPANY NEWS; VW Board Backs Lopez in Dispute With G.M.	Volkswagen A.G. said today that its supervisory board would hold an extraordinary meeting Friday to discuss its trade-secrets fight with General Motors. That dispute centers on VW's head of production, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. G.M. and Adam Opel A.G., its German subsidiary, assert that Mr. Lopez and seven other G.M. employees who followed him when he defected to Volkswagen last spring systematically looted proprietary information about parts prices, new models and strategies. German and American criminal-justice officials are investigating that accusation.
8/5/1993	COMPANY NEWS; VW Sets a Board Meeting on G.M. Dispute	A Michigan appeals court today reversed a ruling handed down in February that had prevented the General Motors Corporation from closing its Willow Run assembly plant in Ypsilanti, Mich. The ruling was a victory for G.M. The auto maker had determined in 1992 that it wanted to consolidate production at a plant in Arlington, Tex., because of financial losses and declining sales of its large, rear-wheel-drive cars like the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster and Cadillac Brougham.
8/3/1993	Car Sales Up, G.M. Reports	The General Motors Corporation posted a 9.9 percent increase in sales of domestically made cars in mid-July, the company said today. The report caused the annual sales rate for the entire industry to be revised to 6.7 million, from 6.4 million for the period. Other United States auto makers reported their mid-July sales figures July 23. G.M., the industry leader, which makes up about 43 percent of the domestic market, did not report sales because of a companywide vacation in the last two weeks of July.
8/3/1993	G.M. Chief Talks to VW On Dispute	The corporate espionage melodrama involving the General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen A.G. and German prosecutors moved to the executive suites today with an overseas telephone conference between top executives of the two auto makers, followed by a G.M. demand that VW retract recent allegations. David J. Herman, managing director of Adam Opel A.G., G.M.'s German subsidiary, said today that he was willing to continue discussions with VW about data and documents that G.M. contends were stolen by VW's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former G.M. executive, provided German prosecutors did not object.
8/2/1993	Big Three Tell Labor the Glass Is Half Empty	When General Motors, Ford and Chrysler last week collectively reported profits of $2.34 billion for the second quarter, they found themselves walking a tightrope. The Big Three want to persuade bankers and investors that they have cut costs and capitalized on the recovering demand for automobiles and that their recession-ravaged treasuries are on the mend. At the same time, auto executives must persuade the United Automobile Workers union, with which they are negotiating new contracts, that the glass is still more than half empty.
8/1/1993	POSTINGS: No G.M. Lease Renewal in '95; Fifth Ave. Showroom to Close	For a quarter century, the first floor of the General Motors Building at 767 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, at the southeast corner of Central Park, has been one of the world's most stylish automobile showrooms. By January 1995, however, the venue will go the way of G.M's old Corvair model, as the company has decided not to renew its lease on the 9,000-square-foot space.
7/31/1993	VW Chairman Talks to G.M.	"More information about the trade-secrets dispute between the General Motors Corporation and Volkswagen A.G. came to light today. VW said its chairman, Ferdinand Piech, had spoken briefly by telephone with John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive. VW said Mr. Piech telephoned Mr. Smith earlier today """"to discuss the matter without influencing legal issues."""" The company did not elaborate."
7/30/1993	Lopez Battle Intensifies; Perjury Inquiry Is Begun	"The industrial espionage battle between Volkswagen A.G. and the General Motors Corporation broadened today as prosecutors in Hamburg announced a new investigation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW production chief, whom G.M. has accused of stealing its trade secrets. The new investigation coincided with a fresh round of mudslinging a day after Ferdinand Piech, the chairman of VW, publicly suggested that G.M. might have manipulated evidence. He accused G.M. of waging """"international economic war in order to ruin VW."""" G.M. officials rejected those contentions today at a news conference in Frankfurt."
7/29/1993	COMPANY NEWS; VW Chief Attacks General Motors in Lopez Case	Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen A.G.'s chairman, began a vitriolic counterattack on the General Motors Corporation today, denying allegations of industrial espionage and accusing the American auto maker of misusing Germany's legal system in a campaign of revenge against VW's production chief, who defected from G.M. In his strongest public statements so far, Mr. Piech gave his full support to Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production executive, who is accused along with seven other former G.M. employees of systematically assembling and stealing G.M. trade secrets. German prosecutors and the United States Justice Department are investigating those accusations.
7/28/1993	Lopez's Future May Be Topic A	Ferdinand Piech, chairman of Volkswagen A.G., scheduled a news conference early Wednesday at company headquarters here, presumably to discuss growing allegations of industrial espionage by the General Motors Corporation against a former executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who jumped to Volkswagen in March. He is now VW's second-ranking official. European newspapers and magazines have been full of reports that Mr. Lopez will step aside to defend himself and that Mr. Piech, in backing Mr. Lopez, has suffered damage to his own reputation.
7/28/1993	Report on Trade Treaty Is Critical of Companies	A report scheduled to be released in Washington on Wednesday accuses several major American companies that are staunch supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement of having shifted thousands of jobs to Mexico, consistently violated workers' rights here and used Mexican plants to make products that have been banned in the United States. The corporations named in the report by the Institute for Policy Studies are part of a pro-treaty lobbying group called USA*NAFTA. Officials at the organization's headquarters in Washington had not seen the report and declined to comment. Corporations Deny Accusations But some of the corporations named in the study denied the accusations or accused the authors of repeating old claims that had been refuted. They include a charge that the General Motors Corporation plant in Matamoros, Mexico, is dumping into an open canal a toxic chemical called methylene chloride at more than 216,000 times the allowed American standard, and another chemical called xylene at 6,400 times the rate allowed in the United States.
7/27/1993	G.M.'s Undeclared European War	The dispute between the General Motors Corporation and Volkswagen A.G. goes beyond a scrap over trade secrets into a no-holds-barred, international battle for strategic position in the increasingly competitive European auto market, industry experts say. So far, G.M. is seen as clearly having the upper hand. Prosecutors in Darmstadt, Germany, as well as the Justice Department in the United States are investigating the company's assertion that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's chief of production and purchasing, and seven other former G.M. employees who followed him when he jumped from G.M. to the German auto maker in March, systematically gathered and stole trade secrets.
7/26/1993	Where a Man G.M. Calls Turncoat Is Still a Hero	At the unspoken heart of the vicious corporate battle that pits the General Motors Corporation against Volkswagen of Germany, there stands a verdant expanse of farmland and pine-clad hills on the outskirts of this sleepy provincial town in the Spanish Basque country. Cows graze, tractors trundle, the late-afternoon sun casts long shadows. There is nothing to suggest anything but somnolent rural tradition. Yet it is here that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, late of General Motors, now of Volkswagen, has long wanted to build a revolutionary auto plant that would slash the production time for a car to 12 hours, or 30 percent below what even the Japanese can achieve today.
7/25/1993	Can an Old Favorite Learn New Tricks?	THE Corvette, long admired for its cheetah-like quickness and agility, was becoming an endangered species. Since the mid-1980's, the General Motors Corporation's two-seat Corvette, though it does add a little to G.M.'s bottom line, has been out-gunned by ever more sophisticated Japanese sports machines. And the tiny population of buyers who will spend nearly $40,000 on a sports car has not grown. Worse, G.M. is strapped for investment capital to develop models purely for reasons of image or esprit.
7/24/1993	VW Chief Discusses Lopez With German State Official	The chairman of Volkswagen A.G., Ferdinand Piech, met today with Gerhard Schroder, the Premier of Lower Saxony state, which is VW's largest shareholder, to discuss the trade-secrets dispute involving General Motors and a top VW executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. The unscheduled meeting was held in Frankfurt, where Mr. Schroder, a prominent member of VW's supervisory board, was traveling on state business, a spokesman for the state government said. The two men met alone and talked for two hours.
7/23/1993	German Prosecutors Link Lopez to Secret G.M. Papers	German prosecutors said today that documents belonging to General Motors that were found in the home of an aide to Volkswagen's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, included secret plans expressly copied for Mr. Lopez before he left G.M. for VW. The announcement was made in a statement by the prosecutor's office in Darmstadt, Germany. The prosecutors said they were broadening their investigation of G.M.'s claim that Mr. Lopez and seven other former G.M. employees who followed him to Volkswagen this year had systematically gathered trade secrets and absconded with them. The investigation will now include the two former G.M. officials who lived in the house where the documents were found late last month, the prosecutors said. The two men were among those who had joined Mr. Lopez at VW.
7/21/1993	A Hamburg Judge Rebuffs Lopez of VW	The credibility of an embattled top Volkswagen executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, was damaged today when a Hamburg court ruled that Der Spiegel, Germany's most influential news magazine, could continue to report assertions that he took secret documents from the General Motors Corporation. The ruling came in a dispute between G.M., Mr. Lopez's former employer, and Volkswagen, which has grown into a fierce feud over trade secrets. German prosecutors as well as the United States Justice Department are investigating the possible theft of G.M. documents by Mr. Lopez and several of his colleagues who also left G.M. for VW.
7/21/1993	Rebate Offer Should Not Harm G.M.	G.M.'s proposed settlement of lawsuits related to the company's pickup trucks is unlikely to create a huge financial liability for the No. 1 auto maker, analysts said today. Late Monday, the General Motors Corporation said it would settle 36 class-action lawsuits by giving certificates for a $1,000 rebate on the purchase of a new truck to owners of G.M. pickups equipped with side-mounted fuel tanks from the years 1973 to 1987. Critics say the trucks are more likely to catch fire or explode in an accident than other vehicles.
7/20/1993	G.M. Plans Rebates to Settle Suits	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would give a $1,000 rebate for the purchase of a new truck to each of the millions of current owners of 1973 to 1987 G.M. pickups with side-mounted fuel tanks, thus settling 36 class-action lawsuits. The value of the rebates could conceivably exceed $5 billion, although G.M. said the settlement would not be a financial drain on the company.
7/17/1993	G.M. Says U.S. Joins Inquiry on Company Papers	"The General Motors Corporation said today that the Justice Department was investigating """"the possible theft of G.M. documents by certain of our former employees."""" A spokesman for the United States Attorney's office in Detroit declined to comment."
7/14/1993	G.M. Plans To Increase 1994 Prices	Amid an increasingly robust automotive market, the General Motors Corporation said today that it would raise the prices of its 1994 models by an average of 1.5 percent for cars and 2.2 percent for trucks. At the same time, more equipment that had been optional would become standard and included in the price of a vehicle, the company said.
7/14/1993	Big 3 Rebuffed on Minivans	Detroit's Big Three auto makers lost another round today in their attempt to convince trade officials that the Japanese were selling minivans below cost in the United States. The United States Court of International Trade, which serves as an appeals tribunal in trade issues, rejected arguments by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation that Japanese manufacturers had inflicted financial harm on them by selling minivans at less than fair market value, which is called dumping.

The fight between Volkswagen and General Motors mounted today after VW's chairman accused a G.M executive in Europe of waging a vendetta against the German auto maker.The latest chapter in the international corporate rivalry involving secret G.M. documents and the defection of a top G.M. executive to VW came with published comments by Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen's chairman, about G.M.'s legal campaign against Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who abruptly quit G.M. in March to take charge of VW's worldwide production.
7/13/1993	G.M. in a Deal to Supply Engine Blocks to Toyota	The General Motors Corporation announced a contract today to supply engine blocks to the Toyota Motor Corporation, an example of what Japanese auto makers say is their growing effort to reduce trade frictions with the United States. Starting in mid-1994, G.M.'s foundry in Defiance, Ohio, will produce up to 180,000 engine blocks a year for Toyota's four-cylinder engine, used in the Toyota Camry built in Georgetown, Ky.

PAPERS FOUND IN VW MANAGERS' HOMES	Prosecutors in Germany said yesterday that they had found papers belonging to the General Motors Corporation's German subsidiary, Adam Opel A.G., in the Wiesbaden apartments of at least two managers of a competitor, Volkswagen A.G. Volkmar Kallenbach, a spokesman for the prosecutors, said the VW managers, whom he would not identify, were previously employed by G.M. and were associates of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, G.M.'s former purchasing chief who joined Volkswagen as its head of production and purchasing in March.
7/2/1993	G.M. Elevates Officials	Directors of the General Motors Corporation elected five corporate vice presidents to its automotive components group today.

The layoffs may be permanent if a Michigan court rules in G.M.'s favor, allowing it to close the plant. The company wants to move production of its Chevrolet Caprice cars to Arlington, Tex.
6/27/1993	Its Courtship Over, E.D.S. Seems Eager to Play the Field	WHEN Britain's largest telephone company backed away last month from a proposed alliance with the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, the initial reaction from some investors and industry observers was one of pity. But Lester M. Alberthal Jr., chairman, president and chief executive of the Dallas-based computer services company owned by the General Motors Corporation, says far from being the wallflower at the global dance, E.D.S. is doing just fine, thank you.

The companies said they would also combine their software laboratories into the new venture to build integrated versions of the software.
6/22/1993	Mexican G.M. Jobs Shift to U.S.	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would move some of the production of its Chevrolet Cavalier subcompact car from Mexico to Lansing, Mich., next year. The move will create up to 1,000 jobs at G.M.'s Lansing assembly complex that will be filled, at least partly, by laid-off workers.
6/21/1993	Market Place; Sluggish European Sales Affect the Big 3 in Different Ways	UNFORTUNATELY for investors in American auto stocks, the budding automotive recovery in the United States has been undercut somewhat by a prostrate European market. The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company depend heavily on earnings from Europe, while the Chrysler Corporation has little manufacturing there and minimal exports. Not surprisingly, the stocks of G.M. and Ford have been penalized by the European market, while the strongly performing Chrysler shares have not.
6/16/1993	G.M. FILES CALIFORNIA APPLICATION FOR ELECTRIC CAR	"The General Motors Corporation has filed an application with the California Air Resources Board to certify its Impact electric car as a """"zero emission"""" vehicle as mandated by California standards starting in 1998."
6/15/1993	Lopez Plan For Factory Is Studied	Volkswagen A.G.'s flamboyant purchasing chief said today that the auto maker was pressing ahead with negotiations to build a highly efficient car plant in Spain despite the threat of legal action from his former employer, the General Motors Corporation. The concept of the low-cost plant, using radical new ideas like having parts suppliers help to assemble the vehicle, has been at the heart of a dispute between the executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and G.M., which rejected Mr. Lopez's proposals for a similar project before he left Detroit for Volkswagen in March.
6/14/1993	Keeping Secrets; Real Life Seems to Mirror A Training Game at Opel	"It started out as a light-hearted board game aimed at teaching employees the geographical complexities of the General Motors Corporation's Adam Opel plant here. But in what an Opel spokesman, Erich Kupfer, said was """"a macabre quirk of fate,"""" the game, in which players have to catch a spy before he escaped with important documents, has strange parallels to the defection of a senior G.M. manager, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, to Volkswagen, where he is now manager of purchasing and production."
6/12/1993	G.M. Puts Closings Into Bargaining Stance	The General Motors Corporation could close or sell some parts-making subsidiaries unless it gains concessions on wages from the United Automobile Workers in contract talks, a top company executive said today, sketching out the company's bargaining stance before the contract talks begin on June 23. Since those subsidiaries, which make products like bearings and axles, generally compete against companies that are not organized by the U.A.W., G.M. pays up to 50 percent more in wages than its competitors, driving up its costs of production, said the official, who outlined some G.M. bargaining goals for reporters on the condition that he not be identified.
6/4/1993	G.M. to Hold Down Prices On Its 1993 Cars and Trucks	The General Motors Corporation, hoping to gain additional share of the United States vehicle market, said today that it would hold the line on the retail prices of its cars and light trucks through the 1993 model year, which will end in four months. With competing auto makers having raised prices lately, the action by General Motors would exploit an opportunity to highlight its cars and light trucks as superior values and to gain market share, analysts said. For 1992, the No. 1 auto maker had roughly a 34 percent share of the United States vehicle market.
6/4/1993	Vehicle Sales Rose 15% in May	United States sales of cars and light trucks rose 15 percent in May, compared with May 1992, the leading auto makers reported today. The big gain, which included sales of domestic and imported vehicles, came as the Ford Motor Company said it had record truck sales for the month. In addition, the Chrysler Corporation reported its best overall May sales in five years.

6/2/1993	G.M. Delays Remote-Door Mini-Van	Remote-controlled sliding doors, a technological innovation that the General Motors Corporation hoped would breathe some life into the listless sales of its mini-vans, have been delayed until the fall because of defects discovered during testing. The new feature, announced in February with fanfare at the Chicago Auto Show, was supposed to be available in April. But G.M. said today that it now planned to offer it sometime in September, on 1994 models.

5/27/1993	COMPANY NEWS; Ex-G.M. Aides Can Work at VW, Court Rules	A German court today rejected an attempt by the General Motors Corporation to prevent seven G.M. managers who followed Jos Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to Volkswagen from working there for one year. The decision by the Frankfurt State Court's civil chamber, denying G.M.'s request for an injunction, was the latest twist in a complex and increasingly acrimonious battle between G.M., the world's largest auto manufacturer, and Volkswagen, the largest in Europe, over the circumstances surrounding Mr. Lopez's hiring.
5/26/1993	Clinton Says U.S. Car Makers Are 'Winning the Quality Race'	Sales of domestically built cars and trucks rose 18.4 percent in mid-May as consumers put aside fears of economic weakness and responded to low interest rates on financing, the auto makers said today. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 7.4 million for the period of May 11-20, up from 6.4 million in early May and up from 6.7 million for the same period a year earlier.
5/26/1993	Low Interest Rates Help U.S. Vehicle Sales	"The conflict between the General Motors Corporation and Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the hard-driving executive who left G.M. for Volkswagen in March, intensified today into a barrage of attacks and counterattacks. Mr. Lopez denied taking any G.M. documents, filed a defamation complaint against his former employer, and for the first time stated his reasons for resigning from the world's largest auto maker. """"We have not taken anything from these people, not any document that is confidential,"""" Mr. Lopez said in a telephone interview from Germany. """"We will not even pass confidential information that is in our heads."""" Press Fascination in Germany Earlier in the day, though, the new issue of Der Spiegel, the popular German news weekly, appeared, with a photo of Mr. Lopez on its cover -- his arms folded and with a grim stare. The headline said: """"The Unscrupulous One. VW Manager Lopez Under Suspicion: Industrial Espionage."

He will remain a vice president of G.M.
5/25/1993	G.M. Shifts Top-Level Executives	Just days before resigning from the General Motors Corporation, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua attended top-level G.M. strategy meetings in Europe and requested copies of all reports and written material presented there, G.M. executives said over the weekend. Their comments provided the first details about their decision to file a criminal complaint against the former head of the company's global purchasing operation. G.M. executives say they believe that Mr. Lopez, knowing he was about to resign on March 10 to take a job with Volkswagen A.G., planned to take the copies and other important documents with him. G.M. officials said the documents contained the prices the auto maker pays for parts and materials, their specifications and long-range schedules for the introduction of new models in Europe.
5/24/1993	G.M. Cites Requests By Lopez	"The General Motors Corporation said today that it had asked German law-enforcement officials to take criminal action against the former head of its global purchasing operations, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, because G.M. believes Mr. Lopez and others took confidential documents when they left the company several weeks ago. Mr. Lopez, an engineer who helped revive General Motors' European operations in the 1980's before being transferred to Detroit, stunned the automotive world when he resigned after nine months in the United States. He left G.M. to become a top executive with Volkswagen A.G., Germany's largest auto maker and one of G.M.'s biggest competitors in Europe. Several Executives Defected Six other G.M. executives, three from Detroit and three from the company's Adam Opel A.G. division in Europe, followed Mr. Lopez to VW later in March. The defections prompted G.M. to obtain a court injunction blocking VW and Mr. Lopez from """"systematically hiring"""" G.M. executives."

5/19/1993	COMPANY NEWS	Sales of domestically produced vehicles rose 30.2 percent in early May, the nation's auto makers said today, extending the strengthening automotive market into a fourth straight month. Demand for light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, showed particular strength, with a 44.4 percent sales gain in the period from May 1 to May 10, to 126,324, compared with 87,497 in the comparable period a year ago.
5/14/1993	Sales of U.S.-Produced Vehicles Up	If interest rates stay low through Oct. 1, the unfunded pension liability of the General Motors Corporation could increase to $19 billion or $20 billion by the end of 1993, up from $14 billion, the auto maker said in documents distributed today. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, G.M. said it might be forced to take a $1.8 billion charge against equity by the end of the year to reflect the higher liability. The charge would not affect earnings but would reduce shareholder equity.
5/14/1993	Market Place; In its contract talks with auto workers, G.M. has much to lose.	SINCE John F. Smith Jr. took command of the General Motors Corporation last November, investors and analysts have praised his restructuring skills. G.M. stock, following earnings improvements in the last two quarters, has appreciated steadily. From a low on Mr. Smith's watch of $29.75 on Nov. 12, the stock closed yesterday at $40.25 a share, down $1, on the New York Stock Exchange. The majority of analysts following G.M., under the assumption that cost-cutting will continue, are recommending the perennially lagging stock. But that optimism could evaporate swiftly if the auto maker fails to win concessions in health care, job security and other labor costs during this summer's collective bargaining with the United Automobile Workers union.
5/13/1993	Agency Reorganizes To Serve Oldsmobile	Leo Burnett U.S.A. of Chicago yesterday announced a substantial reorganization of the way it handles its important Oldsmobile account. The changes were promised to the auto maker when Burnett retained the account in February after an unprecedented review. James E. Thompson, 48, the agency's executive vice president and director of creative services, has been appointed to the additional position of client service director on the Oldsmobile account. He succeeds Ted Jordan, who is currently between assignments at the agency.

There has been no Corvette, for example, and I would love to have a Corvette. I have never owned a Mustang, Ford's original pony car. Nor have I sallied forth to fly home in a Camaro or Firebird.
5/2/1993	AUTO UNION SEEKS TO DETER DETROIT FROM NEW LAYOFFS	Unable to stop layoffs and plant closings, the United Auto Workers are preparing for contract negotiations with the Big 3 auto makers by embracing a major shift in policy. More than ever before, this flagship of the American union movement is focusing its attention on keeping its current, aging members on full salary and benefits until they retire -- rather than preserving the jobs for successive generations. The strategy, clearly visible at a U.A.W. conference last week, is critical for survival, the union leadership says. But some union officials and members say the new approach, and a willingness to bend traditional union goals in other areas, could end up destroying the union rather than saving it. Adapt, Rather Than Confront The debate between union leaders who consider themselves flexible and willing to adapt to the auto makers' needs and those who prefer a more traditional militancy makes the U.A.W. a testing ground for organized labor. That is happening just as the Clinton Administration says it is willing to help unions regain some of their old powers.
4/30/1993	G.M. Posts Half-Billion In Profits	With revenue up and many costs down, the General Motors Corporation yesterday reported first-quarter net income of $513.2 million, in contrast to a loss a year ago. That completed a good first quarter for the Big Three auto makers. On Wednesday, the Ford Motor Company reported its best quarter in several years; last week, the Chrysler Corporation reported strong operating earnings.
4/30/1993	G.M. Makes Case Today On Safety of Its Pickups	To a motorist, no nightmare holds more terror than a flaming crash. To General Motors, few nightmares could be worse than a public hearing, under television's glare, involving appearances by burn victims and survivors of people who died in fiery accidents. Yet that is what the company faces if it cannot persuade engineers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to change their minds.
4/29/1993	Auto Makers Ask White House for Broad Range of Help	The chief executives of the Big Three auto makers asked top Administration officials today for help on a broad range of issues including international trade, regulations, technology and health insurance. John F. Smith Jr. of General Motors, Harold A. Poling of Ford Motor and Robert J. Eaton of Chrysler urged the joint development of a comprehensive plan to help the auto industry regain its global preeminence.
4/20/1993	Corrections	A news analysis article in Business Day on April 12, about the Government's request for a recall of 4.7 million full-size General Motors pickup trucks, misstated the position of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on the trucks' safety. The institute, a research group supported by insurance companies, contends that the incidence of fire in collisions of full-size G.M. pickup trucks provides enough basis for a Government investigation of defects. But it has taken no position on whether the trucks pose a particular hazard and has not asserted that G.M. trucks may be safer than other models in accidents that do not involve fire.
4/17/1993	Toyota to Sell G.M.-Made Cars in Japan	"In a deal that would increase American car exports to Japan, the General Motors Corporation has tentatively agreed to make up to 20,000 Toyotas a year in the United States for sale by the Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan.

4/16/1993	G.M. to Make Toyota Cars for Sale in Japan	In a deal that would increase American car exports to Japan, the General Motors Corporation has tentatively agreed to make up to 20,000 cars a year in the United States for sale by the Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan under the Toyota brand name. The arrangement, confirmed by G.M. today, would be a reversal of the usual pattern in which Japanese companies have made cars in Japan that are sold to American consumers as G.M., Ford and Chrysler cars.
4/15/1993	Sales Rise For Vehicles Built in U.S.	Sales of domestically built vehicles excluding those built by the Ford Motor Company rose 14.8 percent in early April from the corresponding period a year ago. In a deviation from its pattern of reporting on the same day as other auto makers, Ford said it would release its 10-day sales figures on Thursday. The Chrysler Corporation does not provide partial monthly figures; its sales are estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports. 'Demand Is Only So-So' Some analysts cautioned that demand could be slightly better or slightly worse once hard data from Ford and Chrysler were available.
4/14/1993	Clean-Air Laws Push Big 3 To Cooperate on Electric Car	In an extraordinary collaboration by Detroit's auto makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are discussing jointly building an electric car to meet the requirements of the clean-air law first enacted in California and recently adopted by several Northeastern states. Officials of the companies said yesterday that they were considering the project because of impending deadlines.
4/14/1993	Auto Makers In Joint Patent	The Big Three auto makers said today that their research consortium had been awarded its first patent. The patent covers technology that one day may permit auto makers to substitute parts made of lighter-weight plastic composite materials for parts made of steel, thus improving fuel economy. The United States Council for Automotive Research, which was started by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler last year, said the patent represented the first time the auto makers together had produced an original technology.

Unusual as it may seem, those goods, bearing the familiar crest-and-wreath logo and the name of the luxury car, are now selling in Japan. Other items, like apparel, are expected later this year in Taiwan and China. The premium products -- about $80 for a wallet or $200 for a duffle bag -- all carry hangtags stating """"Officially licensed product of the Cadillac Motor Car division, General Motors Corporation."
4/12/1993	A Battle Over Truck Safety With No Winners in Sight	By asking the General Motors Corporation to recall 4.7 million full-size pickup trucks, the Federal Government has set in motion a process that may drag on for years, with lawyers, regulators, consumer groups and auto makers debating the industry's safety obligations. The Government's request also dealt a serious setback, although not a decisive one, to the auto maker's efforts to emerge from a legal, political and public relations quagmire. Before the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued its preliminary finding on Friday, G.M. had hoped that the agency would close its nine-month defect investigation with a finding that the full-size pickups did not have fuel system safety defects. Instead, G.M. must now explain to the Government by April 30 why it thinks the model, built between 1973 and 1987, should not be recalled.
4/10/1993	Recall Is Sought Over Fire Risk In G.M. Trucks	The Federal Government today asked General Motors to voluntarily recall millions of pickup trucks that critics charge are fire hazards, the Transportation Department said today. The request -- which G.M. immediately said it would resist -- was based on a preliminary finding by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the gasoline tanks in full-sized Chevrolet and GMC pickups built from 1973 through 1987 were dangerous. An estimated 4.7 million of those models are still on the road.
4/7/1993	New Dispute Over Pickups	While Federal officials continue to review whether to order a recall of some 4.5 million older General Motors pickup trucks as fire hazards, a dispute broke out between consumer advocates and the car maker on the issue. The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group in Washington, contended yesterday that G.M. did not tell officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it had used steel cages to protect fuel tanks on utility vehicles made between 1978 and 1983 but not on pickups made at the same time.
4/6/1993	G.M.

After a meeting of G.M. directors in New York, the auto maker said that G. Richard Wagoner, who is also executive vice president, would expand his responsibilities to include those that had been Mr. Lopez's.

Mr. Lopez is now the No. 2 executive at Volkswagen A.G. Following Mr. Lopez's lead, a number of key G.M. executives and managers have defected to VW in recent months, supposedly for higher pay. Several more may follow unless a temporary injunction granted Friday in Frankfurt persuades Mr. Lopez to stop raiding his former employer.

David J. Herman, Opel's chairman, said his purchasing department had lost eight managers to Volkswagen since VW hired Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from G.M. two weeks ago. The Spanish industrial engineer has an almost legendary reputation as a cost cutter, which is what Volkswagen, with its high production costs, sorely needs.

Man No. 2	Volkswagen A.G. announced today that it had named Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former purchasing chief for the General Motors Corporation, as its No. 2 executive with unprecedented power to deal with the German auto maker's most serious problem: prohibitively high costs for parts, labor and production.Mr. Lopez, a 52-year-old industrial engineer from the Basque region of Spain, was designated chief of production optimization and purchasing, and was given a seat on VW's managing board.
3/17/1993	BURLINGTON GIVES CONTRACT TO G.M. AND SIEMENS	The Burlington Northern Railroad awarded a contract valued at more than $650 million to General Motors' electromotive division and Siemens Transportation Systems Inc. to supply 350 high-performance diesel freight locomotives using an alternating current electric system. Eight of the 4,000-horsepower locomotives will be delivered this year, and 60 to 100 locomotives will be delivered in following years until 1997. The freight locomotives are expected to be the first to use alternating current traction systems, rather than direct current technology, in North America.
3/16/1993	Changing a Change of Mind, An Executive Quits at G.M.	From the moment Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua arrived at the General Motors Corporation's headquarters from Europe nine months ago, the straitlaced American automobile industry has never seen anyone so driven and so personally eccentric challenging the Motor City's protocol. Little did anyone guess, until this afternoon, just how eccentric.
3/15/1993	Executive Will Stay With G.M.	In an abrupt change of heart, a hard-charging Spanish purchasing executive who in nine months saved hundreds of millions of dollars in costs for the General Motors Corporation, decided over the weekend not to leave G.M. for a more prestigious post at Volkswagen A.G. of Germany G.M. apparently succeeded in persuading Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to stay on by offering him greater authority over manufacturing operations, said several G.M. executives who spoke on condition of anonymity.
3/14/1993	The Clinton Fuel Tax Finds a Few Unexpected Allies	ORDINARILY, big companies are not eager for their customers to pay higher taxes any more than the customers themselves like it. But President Clinton's proposed energy tax is demonstrating that, among big auto-makers, refiners and utilities, politics is thicker than oil. If enacted as proposed, the tax would raise gasoline prices by at least 8 cents a gallon, and a typical homeowner's electric bill by $1.50. However, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have decided they support the higher fuel tax, and, broadly speaking, so do the chairmen of Arco, the refining company, and Southern California Edison, the utility. Other companies the tax would hurt have hinted that they are not entirely against it.
3/14/1993	Pontiac's Trans Sport Keeps on Truckin'	THE New York Auto Show is coming around again, and when it opens on April 10 it will mark its seventh year at the Javits Convention Center, which is hard to believe. At least for curmudgeons like me. For 30 years, the exposition had been crammed into the Coliseum at Columbus Circle, and I remember that final 1986 show as if it were yesterday. The Coliseum was on death row, due imminently for the wrecker's ball, and the show had to move.
3/14/1993	Volkswagen Says G.M. Blocked Its Effort to Lure a Top Executive	"The hard-charging Spanish purchasing executive who last week resigned from the General Motors Corporation to take a job with Volkswagen A.G. might not be leaving G.M. after all. The German automobile maker announced late today that the executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, had asked for a delay of his appointment to a top post, which was to have been confirmed at a board meeting in Germany on Tuesday. VW and Mr. Lopez would continue talks toward a later starting date, the German company said in a statement, with a decision expected """"within one year."
3/12/1993	Cost-Cutter Is Leaving G.M. Post	The hard-charging Spaniard who turned the General Motors Corporation on its ear by demanding lower prices from suppliers and forcing changes in manufacturing operations said today that he was leaving the company. It had been rumored for weeks that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would leave G.M., and although he did not say today where he was going, he is expected to accept a top executive post Tuesday with Volkswagen A.G., one of G.M.'s toughest competitors in Europe. Although Mr. Lopez's authority has steadily expanded since he came to Detroit, the VW post would be much more powerful, according to reports circulating in the industry, and may include responsibility for all production operations.
3/11/1993	Auto Makers See Troubles in Energy Tax	Top Detroit auto executives told a Senate panel today that President Clinton's proposed energy tax would hurt their ability to compete with imports. Robert A. Lutz, the president of the Chrysler Corporation, said that because steel production required a lot of energy the tax could add $50 million to $100 million to the cost of his company's annual steel purchases. He pointed out that foreign car makers would not have to pay the tax.
3/9/1993	Cost-Cutter's G.M. Exit Is Reported	The signs are growing stronger each day that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the General Motors Corporation's energetic purchasing chief, will jump ship next week and join Volkswagen A.G. Ward's Automotive Reports, citing unidentified sources in Wolfsburg, Germany, where VW is based, reported today that Mr. Lopez would join the German auto maker on Tuesday, when several management changes are scheduled to be announced.
3/9/1993	Corrections	An article Feb. 24 about the General Motors plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., misstated an agreement about the company's obligations. According to a G.M. spokeswoman, Margaret G. Holmes, the company promised to make certain payments in lieu of taxes from 1985 to 1995. It was not required to stay in North Tarrytown until 1995.
3/7/1993	How G.M. Is Losing Its Hold on the Crucial Family Sedan	THE big battle for the midsize family sedan market isn't going well for the General Motors Corporation. Sales of the Chevrolet Lumina, a linchpin of G.M.'s strategy to shore up its eroding domination of the midsize market, have been slow -- slow enough that the company is laying off 1,450 workers this month at its Lumina plant in Oshawa, Canada.
3/5/1993	COMPANY BRIEFS	GENERAL MOTORS CORP., Detroit, will suspend production at its Willow Run car assembly plant in Ypsilanti, Mich. for a second week starting Monday because of slow sales. ROHR INC., is trying to sell its aircraft parts plant in Hagerstown, Md., but the 400-worker factory could be closed if a buyer is not found, company officials said yesterday.
3/2/1993	Cost Cutter Lifts Ax Over G.M. Plants	The cost-cutting ax of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is likely to fall heavier this year on the General Motors Corporation than on its outside suppliers. G.M. has scheduled about 1,000 cost-cutting workshops this year for the outside suppliers, Mr. Lopez announced today at a luncheon here in his honor; he will hold 1,300 workshops inside G.M. manufacturing plants, including final-assembly plants. The workshops on how to increase efficiency may result in changing the layout of machines, consolidating jobs or altering the flow of raw materials.
2/27/1993	Behind the New Apology From NBC	"For the second time this month, NBC News has acknowledged on the air that pictures it used to illustrate a news story were inaccurate. But unlike the abject admission by NBC that it participated in the faking of evidence used in a report on General Motors trucks, NBC executives now say that a report on the clear-cutting of forests in Idaho, broadcast last month on the """"NBC Nightly News,"""" was a minor mistake. Betty Hudson, senior vice president of corporate communication for NBC, said the latest instance was """"analagous to a newspaper miscaptioning a picture."
2/26/1993	A G.M. Jobless Fund Runs Out; the 2d Is Solvent	A $1.7 billion fund paying benefits to about 14,000 laid-off auto workers at the General Motors Corporation will run out of money on March 1, almost seven months before the automobile union's three-year contract with G.M. expires, the company said today. But G.M. and the United Automobile Workers union said a second jobless benefits fund would take over payments, so no one would be left without checks.
2/25/1993	Is VW Wooing G.M. Cost Cutter?	The General Motors Corporation's new purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who has shaken suppliers and the United Automobile Workers union with his cost-cutting initiatives, is being courted by Volkswagen A.G., auto industry executives said today. The German auto maker and G.M. would not officially confirm the reports, but German Government and automotive circles are abuzz with talk that Mr. Lopez may accept a top executive position at Volkswagen as part of broader management changes coming in mid-March.
2/24/1993	PENTAGON MISSILE CONTRACT TO HUGHES AND RAYTHEON	The General Motors Corporation's Hughes division and the Raytheon Company have been awarded a combined $627 million air-to-air missile contract, the Defense Department said yesterday. Hughes received the larger part of the award, worth $333 million over three years for 849 of the medium-range missiles. Hughes will build 580 missiles for the United States Air Force, and the Navy will get 96. Britain will buy 58; South Korea and Turkey, 56 each, and 3 will go to the European fighter development program. Raytheon will receive $294 million to build 614 missiles.
2/24/1993	Incentive Plan Seeks to Save G.M. Plant	In a long-shot effort to keep the huge car assembly plant here from closing, New York State officials are knitting together a multimillion-dollar package of inducements for the General Motors Corporation, including financing for the plant's retooling and the building of a companion parts-making plant an hour away. The state is trying to avert the loss of 3,000 jobs and a $122 million payroll when G.M. closes the plant in 1995. The loss, wrenching for the local economy, would have repercussions statewide because of its effect on tax revenues. But executives at G.M. said they knew of no changes in the plan to close the plant.
2/23/1993	G.M. DISCUSSING SALE OF LOTUS TO MANAGEMENT GROUP	The General Motors Corporation is negotiating to sell the unprofitable Lotus Cars Ltd., a British sports car maker, possibly to a management group. G.M. confirmed yesterday that it had been approached by several potential acquirers. Adrian Palmer, managing director of Lotus, heads one of the interested groups, the auto maker said. G.M. bought Lotus for about $32 million in 1986. Lotus had a loss of nearly $23 million in 1991 on sales of $62.2 million.
2/21/1993	Corrections	"Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the """"Dateline NBC"""" report that prompted a defamation lawsuit from General Motors referred incorrectly in some editions to NBC's investigation of the report. It was the network, not its news division, that hired two outside lawyers to investigate."
2/20/1993	G.M.'s White-Collar Staff Is Offered a Novel Buyout	"The General Motors Corporation continued its effort to trim its payroll yesterday, offering its salaried employees a plan that in effect pushes them out by paying them to look for new jobs. The plan, which G.M. calls a """"career transition program,"""" gives management personnel in the United States and Canada the chance to take a paid leave as long as 15 months. Employees who enter the program must leave the company."
2/19/1993	Auto Makers in Paint Deal	The Big Three auto makers formed a consortium today to share technology and costs for developing low-emission paint systems aimed at reducing air pollution at more than 50 automotive assembly plants in the United States. The consortium will work to develop powder-based primer and clear-coat systems through the improvement of materials, equipment and operations, said John Young, chairman of the low-emission paint consortium who is an executive engineer at the Ford Motor Company.
2/19/1993	NBC and the Lawyers	"To the Editor: Re """"NBC, Hiding Behind the Lawyers"""" (editorial, Feb. 17), on the fiery collision of General Motors pickup trucks shown on """"Dateline NBC"""":"
2/17/1993	NBC, Hiding Behind the Lawyers	"Most of the country now knows that NBC faked a fiery collision during a prime-time """"expose"""" of exploding gas tanks on General Motors pickup trucks. Yet network officials cannot bring themselves to admit that """"Dateline NBC's"""" gaffe was a poisonous professional mistake. They also seem reluctant to investigate the episode, hiring two outside lawyers to do the job for them. Michael Gartner, president of NBC News, defended the show until it became clear that General Motors had the goods. At which point he wheeled out the show's anchors, Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips, to deliver, by way of fervent apology, a dry recitation of how NBC had rigged the trucks with tiny rockets. Then Mr. Gartner announced he had hired the two lawyers to investigate."
2/15/1993	Feeling Vindicated, G.M. Plans No Publicity Drive	The General Motors Corporation says it has no plans to mount an advertising campaign, or a public relations effort, addressing either the apology made to it by NBC News for broadcasting a rigged crash test of G.M. pickup trucks, or a broader dispute about the safety of its vehicles. The automotive giant has joined a growing list of companies selling to consumers that now find their communications strategies questioned in the wake of television news coverage of problems or crises involving their products and services.
2/14/1993	A Tabloid Touch In the Nightly News	"EVER since the Presidential campaign, the television news business seems to have been suffering from an identity crisis. Appearing on MTV and """"Larry King Live,"""" the candidates proved that network news divisions could no longer place their upstart competitors in a different league. Now a few tiny rockets have made such condescension even harder. Last week, in an extraordinary public confession, NBC apologized for errors it had made in a report on General Motors trucks that aired on its news magazine show """"Dateline NBC"""" in November. As part of the report, """"Dateline NBC"""" broadcast a crash demonstration purporting to show one of the trucks bursting into flame as a result of a collision. In fact, the demonstration had been rigged: the truck had been outfitted with rocket-like """"sparking devices"""" to insure that it would explode if the gas tank leaked."
2/14/1993	Wall Street; And General Motors Marches On	IN the battle of the Generals last week, Electric was routed by Motors. As it happens, the same thing has been going on in the stock market since the end of last year. The battle in question was over the news report by General Electric's NBC television network regarding General Motors's old pickup trucks, which are said by some to be unsafe because the gasoline tank is outside the frame of the truck, making it more vulnerable to fire in side collisions. It turns out NBC used remote-controlled miniature rockets to make sure any gasoline that was released would burst into flames. To get out of a libel suit, the brass at G.E. decided to issue an abject apology.
2/14/1993	Saturn Adds a Wagon to the Line	FOR a while there, I thought I had figured it out, figured the easy way to get through the winter. Two years ago, I had shelled out 400 bucks for a snowblower, and Long Island hadn't had more than a dusting of snow since that day. Alas, the magic seemed to be gone, I thought, flailing my way through what was indeed a surprise snowstorm over the Northeast, which unfortunately included the Long Island Expressway. Weaving through pileup after pileup, I was feeling particularly sorry about the two expensively crumpled Mercedes-Benzes at the side of the road.
2/12/1993	Ford and Citibank Issue Card	Moving to counter the General Motors Corporation's entry into the credit-card business, the Ford Motor Company and Citibank introduced a rival program yesterday. Under terms of the Ford Citibank Visa and Mastercard program, card holders would earn rebates on new Ford, Lincoln or Mercury vehicles equal to 5 percent of their total annual purchases, as much as $700 a year and accumulating for up to five years. That's a faster rebate program than offered by the G.M. card, which allows $500 in rebates a year for up to seven years.
2/12/1993	G.M. Lost $23.5 Billion Last Year	General Motors today reported a $23.5 billion loss for 1992, by far the largest ever posted by an American corporation. But most of the loss was for accounting changes, and results excluding the charges indicated that the company's troubled auto maker's operations might be improving. Indeed, Wall Street saw beyond the losses. The General Motors Corporation's shares closed at $40.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.25. It was the most active stock, with nearly 11.3 million shares traded.
2/12/1993	G.M. Resumes Its Advertising On NBC News	"The General Motors Corporation announced yesterday that it was rescinding its ban on advertising on NBC News programs just one day after a company executive said the ban would be indefinite. William J. O'Neill, the director of public affairs for G.M., issued a statement saying that the company is now satisfied with NBC's apology for a report that was broadcast on its news magazine program """"Dateline"""" in November. The report, which questioned the safety of G.M. pickups, included footage of an accident that NBC staged to make sure the truck would catch fire. In response, G.M. had shifted its advertising from NBC News programs to the network's sports and entertainment programs on Monday."
2/11/1993	Critic's Notebook; Truth or Consequences in TV News	"In a breathing space between the servings of crow and humble pie that he downed on behalf of NBC News Tuesday night, Stone Phillips reassured viewers that the contested """"Dateline"""" program about the propensity of some General Motors pickup trucks to burst into fire in a collision had presented """"all sides of the controversy."""" He was like a man gulping a quick Alka-Seltzer toward the end of a """"swallow the whole thing"""" meal. The retraction was delivered as part of a deal to forestall a costly legal crash for the network. Its Nov. 17 report, """"Waiting to Explode,"""" showed tests concocted with the help of incendiary devices -- not standard General Motors equipment -- that were placed under the trucks to encourage a fire if gasoline should flow from ruptured gas tanks. Viewers were not told about this exciting accessory."
2/11/1993	G.M. Suspends Ads on NBC News Despite Apology for Truck Report	"Despite a long and detailed on-air apology from NBC News, General Motors said yesterday that it had suspended advertising on all NBC News programs indefinitely but would continue buying spots on entertainment and sports programs. G.M.'s announcement came as NBC executives announced an """"urgent and intense"""" review of how and why their news magazine program """"Dateline NBC"""" decided to tamper with a G.M. pickup truck so that it would be certain to catch fire in a filmed collision."
2/10/1993	G.M. Blocked From Closing Auto Plant	Faced with the loss of their jobs, more than 2,500 auto workers won a reprieve today when a Michigan judge blocked the General Motors Corporation from closing an assembly plant in Ypsilanti, Mich. The ruling is the second big legal setback recently for G.M., which last week lost a product liability case in Atlanta.
2/10/1993	Excerpts From Statement	"Following are excerpts from a statement read last night by Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips, anchors of """"Dateline NBC,"""" apologizing for a report on a demonstration crash of a General Motors pickup truck: JANE PAULEY First and most importantly, we want to emphasize that what we characterized in the November """"Dateline"""" segment as an unscientific demonstration was inappropriate and does not support the position that G.M.'s CK trucks are defective. Specifically, NBC's contractor did put incendiary devices under the trucks to insure that there would be a fire if gasoline were released from the truck's gas tank. NBC personnel knew this before we heard the program but the public was not informed because consultants at the scene told us the devices did not start the fire. We agree with G.M. that we should have told our viewers about these devices. We acknowledge the placing of the incendiary devices under the truck was a bad idea from start to finish. . . ."
2/10/1993	NBC Settles Truck Crash Lawsuit, Saying Test Was 'Inappropriate'	"In an extraordinary public confession, NBC acknowledged last night that it had erred in broadcasting a report that purported to show a General Motors truck bursting into flame as a result of a collision. On Monday, the General Motors Corporation sued the network over the report, which was broadcast in November on """"Dateline NBC,"""" saying the report was defamatory because """"sparking devices"""" were used."
2/10/1993	Big Three Won't Seek Car Tariffs	Under pressure from foreign auto makers and facing some opposition from the Clinton Administration, the chief executives of Detroit's Big Three announced today that they had decided not to file complaints of unfair trade that would seek steep duties on imported cars. The decision is a boon for consumers, to the extent that they are spared higher prices, and for the Clinton Administration, which would have been forced by Federal law to decide the cases quickly. The Administration is being accused both by some in the United States and by many abroad of protectionist leanings.
2/9/1993	In Suit, G.M. Accuses NBC of Rigging Crash Tests	"In a defamation suit filed in Indiana, the General Motors Corporation today accused NBC and an independent testing laboratory of rigging crash tests for a network broadcast so that certain pickup trucks would appear vulnerable to gas-tank explosions in collisions from the side. Saying """"blatant deception"""" was used in a Nov. 17 broadcast of the NBC program """"Dateline,"""" Harry J. Pearce, G.M.'s executive vice president and general counsel, asserted that model rocket engines had been taped to the bottom of the test vehicles and ignited by radio transmitters just before impact to help produce a fire. Mr. Pearce was flanked by two damaged pickup trucks that G.M. said were used in the tests. He said G.M. workers retrieved the trucks from junkyards near the test site."
2/8/1993	G.M. May Not Join in Move Against Japan	"The General Motors Corporation may not join its two big American rivals in filing broad """"dumping"""" complaints against Japanese car makers, G.M.'s chief executive says. John F. Smith Jr., the president and chief executive of G.M., said that he was not sure the cases could be won and that he was concerned about consumers' reaction to pleas for Government relief at a time when the Big Three are trying to convince the public they can compete with Japanese auto makers in areas like quality, value and customer service."
2/8/1993	G.M. Set To Fight On Pickups	In an unusually aggressive corporate response to a liability problem, the General Motors Corporation is expected to announce today that it will sue NBC and several consumer groups, contending that they rigged crash tests of its pickup trucks. G.M. also said yesterday that it was prepared to use strong technical evidence to prove that the pickups were not dangerously designed. G.M. officials declined to discuss details of the company's campaign, which will be disclosed at a news conference in Detroit. But even with no formal notification that it was being sued, NBC issued a response last night.
2/7/1993	Anticipating Survival After General Motors	"SQUARING his shoulders against the bitter wind that was coming off the Hudson River last week, Mayor Frank J. Rey looked down Beekman Avenue at the bustling village center. """"Everybody keeps asking me, 'Will there be life after G.M.?' """" he said. """"Well, of course there will be,"""" the Mayor said. """"And perhaps in the long run, it will be even better."
2/7/1993	For '93, Sunbird Takes a Smaller Peck	EXCEPT when you're talking about computers or that house that you're trying to unload, the notion that something will have a lower price in 1993 than it did in years past is a novel one indeed. It is particularly odd, as we of the sticker-shock generation know, when applied to automobiles. But it is a happy truth in the case of the new Sunbird, Pontiac's sporty subcompact.
2/6/1993	G.M. Verdict Intensifies Debate on Jury Awards	The mammoth judgment handed down by a Georgia jury on Thursday against the General Motors Corporation has already renewed calls to curb runaway verdicts by placing caps on punitive damage awards. But opponents of such limits maintain that the verdict is justified, because of both the message it sends and the near-certainty that in the end only a small fraction of that money will ever enter the plaintiffs' pockets. Federal Legislation Blocked The verdict shows how far a jury will go when it is convinced that a giant corporation has recklessly or deceitfully endangered lives for a long time. Of the $105.2 million the jury awarded Thomas and Elaine Moseley, whose 17-year-old son died when his 1985 GMC Sierra pickup burst into flames in a collission, $101 million was in punitive damages.
2/5/1993	Enhanced Mastercard Introduced by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation, basking in the budding popularity of its five-month-old credit card, introduced a gold G.M. Mastercard for more affluent customers. Unlike G.M.'s original Mastercard, which offered relatively small lines of credit with no annual fee, the enhanced version will cost $39 annually and offer a credit line of up to $25,000. Customers of the gold card can earn a rebate equal to 5 percent of their outlays toward the purchase of a G.M. car, to a limit of $7,000 at the end of seven years.
2/4/1993	G.M. Promotes Supply Chief	The executive brought over from Europe by the General Motors Corporation in May to shake up the company's supplier network has been promoted. J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was named vice president and group executive of G.M.'s worldwide purchasing group. Mr. Lopez, 52, had previously been vice president of purchasing.
2/4/1993	Chrysler Debt Rating Raised as G.M.'s Is Cut	The Chrysler Corporation's debt ratings were raised yesterday, buoyed by a successful offering of new common stock and strong profit and sales figures. But ratings for the General Motors Corporation were lowered because of concerns over the company's huge obligations to retirees. The Standard & Poor's Corporation said that it had raised ratings on about $15.6 billion of debt issued by Chrysler and its affiliates.
2/2/1993	In a Surprise, Oldsmobile Retains Burnett	The Oldsmobile division of the General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would retain Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago as the agency for its estimated $140 million account The decision was considered a surprise conclusion to a five-month review of the account, which involved 15 agencies and was believed to be the first ever on one of G. M.'s flagship automotive brands. It was also the first time in two years that a review on an automotive account ended with a victory for the incumbent.
1/31/1993	Wall Street; So Long, It's Been Grim to Know You	INVESTORS are often told, when examining a company's performance, be sure to check out its management. If recent trading of a few stocks is any indication, investors should ask a new question: What's the chance the boss will get dumped? Take the American Express Company and I.B.M. In recent months, American Express stock moved up as it searched for a replacement for James D. Robinson 3d, its chairman and chief executive. Meanwhile, I.B.M. stock kept falling as John F. Akers, that company's head, stressed he would not leave.
1/29/1993	G.M. Chairman Backs Director	"John G. Smale, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, issued a statement yesterday in support of Ann D. McLaughlin, a director of the company and a former Labor Secretary. On Wednesday, Roger D. Smith, a former chairman and chief executive of G.M., resigned abruptly as a director of the giant auto maker and suggested that Mrs. McLaughlin had leaked the news of this decision to The Washington Post. """"I, the other members of the board and the management team of General Motors have the utmost regard for Ann McLaughlin, and we are confident that she has at no time disclosed any information that could be detrimental to the corporation,"""" Mr. Smale said. """"Mrs. McLaughlin's performance on the G.M. board has been outstanding, her integrity is impeccable, and we have complete confidence in her ability to fulfill her board responsibilities."
1/28/1993	Roger Smith Is Leaving G.M.'s Board	Roger B. Smith, the individual most closely identified with the disastrous slide of the General Motors Corporation during the past decade, abruptly resigned from G.M.'s board this morning. His resignation came after an article in The Washington Post quoted unidentified sources as saying he had agreed to leave the board. In commenting on his resignation today, Mr. Smith said he suspected that one of G.M.'s outside directors, Ann D. McLaughlin of Washington, had leaked sensitive information to The Post, a charge Ms. McLaughlin strongly denied.
1/27/1993	EX-CHIEF DENIES REPORT HE PLANS TO QUIT G.M. BOARD	"Roger B. Smith, the former chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, is denying a report that he has agreed to resign from the auto maker's board. The Washington Post, in today's issue, said Mr. Smith will retire from the board when his term ends in May. """"That's news to me,"""" Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview late last night. He added that he had told members of G.M.'s nominating committee several times that he will serve """"until they no longer want me."
1/26/1993	G.M. Talks on E.D.S. Move Are Called an Open Secret	While the General Motors Corporation refuses to confirm reports that it is in talks to sell a large portion of its class E shares or a stake in its Electronic Data Systems Corporation to British Telecommunications P.L.C., bankers and financial analysts close to the companies said today that the discussions were an open secret. They said such a sale would have benefits for G.M. because it could allow the auto maker to spend more aggressively on new-vehicle development and to replenish its eroded financial resources.
1/26/1993	Market Place	GENERAL MOTORS needs cash, and its Electronic Data Systems unit looks like it is salable. So should investors who expect a takeover of the unit rush out and buy G.M.'s class E shares, which are tied to the performance of E.D.S.? Maybe not. G.M., in its financial innovations of the 1980's, created one of the more bizarre financial structures in American business, one that is not well understood by many holders. While class E shares pay dividends based on the earnings of E.D.S., the computer company started by Ross Perot, they do not represent ownership of it. They really represent a stake in G.M. itself.
1/25/1993	E.D.S. Silent On Deal Talk	A spokesman for the Electronic Data Systems Corporation declined to comment yesterday on reports that its parent company, the General Motors Corporation, might sell an equity stake in E.D.S. On Saturday, The Dallas Morning News reported that British Telecommunications P.L.C. might buy 25 percent of E.D.S. or even merge the two companies. Tony Good, an E.D.S. spokesman, said the company would not comment for competitive reasons. British Telecommunications executives could not be reached yesterday.
1/24/1993	Again -- and at Last -- a New Camaro	"In the 1960's, muscle cars were like the muscle men of the era: formidable, hulking presences dominated by brute strength. But the science of muscle has come a long way since then. Like today's bodybuilders, the 1993 Camaro is lean, finely proportioned and powerful. It's a muscle car for the Nineties."""" -- Chevrolet overview of the 1993 Camaro. I HAVE been prowling through my computer, looking for notes on a conversation that is now more than a decade old. Electrons are amazing, and I actually found what I was looking for. It turns out that it has been 11 years since that sunny morning when the late Pete Estes and I stood talking in the outdoor dining area of Tavern on the Green in Central Park. Estes was then about to retire as president of General Motors, and he had come to New York to show off his final creation, Chevy's 1982 Camaro. I remember discussing the crucial need for better fuel economy. The new Camaro was lighter than its predecessor but still heavy enough to have displeased the critics. Estes agreed, noting that the engineers had only scratched the surface. """"So far, we've done the easy part,"""" he said. """"We got rid of the fat. The rest is going to be tougher."""" Aha! And now there is a new Camaro, the fourth generation, exactly 100 pounds heavier than the '82 model, but of the modern ilk, which is to say that it looks nothing like Camaros of the past. In the intervening years technology has taken the place of dieting and, heavier or not, the new car does go farther on a gallon of gas. I remember expressing surprise, too, during that conversation with Estes, that G.M. had managed to get 10 years out of the same basic model. And his response was this: """"It shows what you can do when you do it right in the first place."""" In fact, the Camaro and its twin, the Pontiac Firebird, have always been exactly right for their markets, sporty cars that could be dressed inexpensively or in go-fast fashion, appealing both to low-end buyers and to hot-rodders. And the Camaro is still right, still with an available V8 engine to burble pleasantly and to drive the rear wheels, still fast even in its conservative standard mode. The new car competes against the Toyota Celica, Nissan 240SX, Ford Mustang, Eagle Talon, Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse, among others. According to Chevrolet, 50 percent of the buyers in the sporty-car segment are women, and nearly half of Camaro's principal drivers are female, a figure that drops to 30 percent for the high-end Z28. Both the Z28 and the standard car are hatchbacks, and the base coupe carries a 160-horsepower V6. The Z28, with a 5.7-liter V8 under its hood, is as always a flat-out performance car, and it will give a Corvette a run for its money. That is not surprising, of course, since the 5.7-liter power plant is the same basic engine that lives under the Corvette's hood. In the Camaro, it produces 275 horsepower, and its bulk fills the engine compartment. The new 3.4-liter V6 delivers 20 horsepower more than was available in 1992's standard car, and it sends it to the road through a five-speed manual transmission. The V8 produces 30 more horsepower than last year, and it is coupled to a new six-speed manual. Four-speed automatics are optional with either engine. For '93, rack-and-pinion steering has replaced the recirculating-ball system of the past in order to improve responsiveness and an """"on-center"""" feel. Antilock brakes also are standard. The fourth generation car was redesigned head to tail, and Chevrolet's literature says that """"all classic Camaro design ingredients are evident."""" That is arguable, however, and the new model looks more like a Mitsubishi Eclipse than like anything else. Part of that, at least in the case of the Z28, has to do with the paint scheme and the upper body. All Z28's have black roofs, and the darkly tinted glass makes the entire """"greenhouse"""" look black. What has been retained from the past is the Camaro's tenacious stance, aggressive front end and brawny tires on 16-inch wheels. The car is smooth but wedge-shaped. It rides on the same 101-inch wheelbase as the '92, but the body is longer, wider and taller. Sideview mirrors are fared into the front fenders, and a spoiler is integrated into the rear hatch. Trim is of the blackout variety, and the headlights nestle in black pockets. The new Camaro makes extensive use of dent-resistant, rustproof body panels. The roof, doors, hatch and spoiler assembly are made of sheet-molded compound, and the front fenders, and nose and tail pieces also are made of composite material. Rust-resistant two-side galvanized steel is used for the rear quarter panels and hood. The hatch itself has a very high liftover, leading to a deep well just inside and then to a shallow cargo floor. Luggage capacity is not this car's long suit. Space also is at a premium in the rear of the redesigned interior, and even small children are likely to complain. On the other hand, the cockpit is comodious, and the new front buckets -- available only in cloth -- are both commodious and supportive. The black and white Z28 test car had a two-tone gray interior, nicely finished although abundantly plastic. The instrument panel sort of wraps around the driver, and the analog gauges, dominated by a 150-mile per hour speedometer, are easy to read. A huge door covers a medium-size glove compartment, in which resides the remote button for the rear hatch. The console contains a small ashtray, a single cupholder and a bin whose cover serves as an armrest. The shifter, as always, is topped by a large round knob, now covered with leather. As tested and loaded with options, the car carried a sticker of $19,098, although the base price for a Z28 is a more reasonable $16,779. The least expensive Camaro goes for $13,399, and the cars will begin arriving in dealerships early in February. Oddly enough, they are """"imports,"""" coming from an assembly plant near Montreal. And they do now feel less like Detroit iron. The bone-jarring ride of the past is gone, as are many of the creaks and rattles that resulted from the huge metal doors. The new Z28 is tighter and a great deal more civilized than its ancestors. On the road, though, there is still that slingshot acceleration. There is the taut suspension and good handling. And, of course, there is that wonderful rumble of a potent V8. Like the '82 model that lasted almost unchanged for a decade, the newest Z28 has been named to pace the Indianapolis 500. And with the 77th running of the race on May 30, Chevrolet will set a record. In all, nine Chevies will have led the pack. Four of them, including the 1967 original, have been Camaros."
1/20/1993	Pickups Safe, Stempel Says In Testimony	"The former chairman of the General Motors Corporation, Robert C. Stempel, acknowledged yesterday in an Atlanta trial that some of the company's pickup trucks were more likely than competitors' models to catch fire in side collisions. But Mr. Stempel insisted that the vehicles were safe. """"Is there a problem with trucks?"""" he asked rhetorically. """"No."
1/19/1993	G.M. OF CANADA TO ELIMINATE ONE SHIFT AT ONTARIO PLANT	General Motors of Canada said yesterday that it would cut one of four shifts at an assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, in March, eliminating 1,450 jobs. The plant, which produces Chevrolet Luminas, will go to one shift late in the month. The decision reflects continuing weakness in the midsize car market, a spokeswoman said.
1/19/1993	Courtroom Drama Pits G.M. Against a Former Engineer	"In a small Atlanta courtroom, General Motors officials have been witnessing a drama that Hollywood would envy. A former company engineer, who had previously testified only for the car maker, has told a jury that G.M. knew for years that some of its popular pickup trucks were firetraps but that it refused to fix what he called defective fuel tanks. In testimony last week, the safety engineer, Ronald E. Elwell, also drew a chilling portrait of G.M. as a company that altered documents, conducted secret tests and ordered employees not to put criticism of its vehicles in writing. Commentators on Court TV, which is following the trial because of Mr. Elwell's appearance, quickly dubbed him the """"turncoat"""" witness."
1/15/1993	Ex-Employee Testifies That G.M. Knew Truck Design Wasn't Safe	"A former engineer for the General Motors Corporation told a jury here today that company officials believed in 1983 that the fire-safety design of some of its pickup trucks was """"no longer defensible."""" The engineer, Ronald E. Elwell, who worked for the auto maker for about 30 years as a safety specialist, also said that some top engineers at G.M. had decided by 1983 that the vehicles' fuel tanks had to be altered. But the company did not change the design until 1988."
1/12/1993	G.M. Says Review Confirms That Plans Are 'On Target'	"The General Motors Corporation said today that a review of the auto maker's financial management by J. P. Morgan & Company """"confirmed that our financial and operating plans"""" in North America """"are on target."""" The results of the study, which was disclosed first in The Detroit News during the weekend and had been conducted over the last month or so, were reported to G.M. directors during their regular monthly meeting today. The company's stock closed up yesterday 87.5 cents a share, to $34.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. 'Enthusiastically Received' """"The report was enthusiastically received,"""" William E. Hoglund, a G.M. executive vice president, said in a prepared statement."
1/10/1993	Would You Believe 40 Years of Corvettes?	TALK about feeling old. It was the summer of '53 and I was fresh out of high school when I first saw one of those wonderful things. I was driving a wholesaler's truck, delivering cigarettes and candy to stores, and I spotted it on the sidewalk, on display in front of a Chevy dealer on Hanover Avenue in Allentown, Pa.
1/7/1993	G.M.'S OLDSMOBILE UNIT PLANS NEW SALES EFFORT	The General Motors Corporation's Oldsmobile division said yesterday that it would form a special governing board as part of its efforts to adopt the sales style of the company's Saturn Corporation subsidiary. Half of the new 16-member board will be Saturn and Oldsmobile dealers, with the other half Oldsmobile division employees, said John D. Rock, Oldsmobile general manager. The board will make recommendations to help Oldsmobile use lessons from Saturn to revive its sales and image. Mr. Rock said the board was likely to recommend reducing Oldsmobile's current count of 3,100 United States dealers.
1/3/1993	Fleetwood Is the B-I-G News for 1993	WE talked here last week about Lincoln's Town Car, a prime example of modern technology applied to the big and somewhat old-fashioned version of American luxury. Spacious passenger compartment, rear-wheel drive, V8 engine, all that. But Ford revamped the Lincoln for 1990, and the real news in automotive cabin-cruisers this year comes from Cadillac, which has stretched and redesigned its 1993 Fleetwood four-door, making it the longest -- and generally the biggest -- production car sold anywhere in the world.
12/29/1992	One Key or 2 for the Car? Innovation Is Unwanted	Standing in the dark next to a locked Buick, arms filled with packages, a shopper inserts the key in the door; it won't turn. A package falls. The door opens on a second try, but the key fails to turn in the ignition because it has been inserted upside down. In the mid-1970's, the Toyota Motor Corporation, followed by other Japanese auto makers, introduced a way to prevent this annoyance: a single key, insertable in either direction, that unlocks the ignition, door, trunk and glove compartment.
12/27/1992	Profile/Jiro Yanase; Selling Cadillacs in Japan	"TO those who think it is tough to sell American cars in Japan today, Jiro Yanase would like to tell you about 1921, when Japan was so poor that his father, the General Motors dealer, sold only three vehicles all year. Or about World War II, when anyone connected with American cars was considered a traitor. """"Terrorists threw stones at us,"""" he recalled. """"But we never took down the Pontiac and Oldsmobile signs in our service center."
12/22/1992	TOYOTA DENIES REPORT ON USE OF G.M. TRUCK PLANT	"The Toyota Motor Corporation yesterday denied a published report that said the General Motors Corporation had asked the Japanese auto maker to use one of G.M.'s idle factories to build Toyota pickup trucks. G.M. officials did not confirm or deny the report, which appeared yesterday in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business newspaper. """"Certainly the utilization of idled facilities in the United States presents a potential area for discussion,"""" John Mueller, a G.M. spokesman, said."
12/20/1992	Isuzu to Stop Manufacturing Passenger Cars	In a development that only a few years ago might have seemed unimaginable, one of Japan's automobile companies said today that it would give up production of passenger cars. The announcement by Isuzu Motors Ltd., which once achieved popularity in the United States with commercials featuring a lying salesman, reflects the hard times that have befallen Japan's automobile industry.
12/19/1992	Good for G.M., but Bad For Buyers of Its Offer	MANAGERS at General Motors may not be rocket scientists when it comes to running a car company, but investors could pick up a few tips from them on the arcane subject of stock market timing. G.M. was a seller of 55 million new common shares on May 19 -- a marketing coup that brought $2.1 billion in new funds to the company. A master of timing, G.M. pulled in $39 for each of the 55 million new shares. And the stock had traded as low as $26.88 only five months before.
12/19/1992	U.S. Asks G.M. to Explain Truck Safety Data	Federal safety regulators have asked the General Motors Corporation to explain apparent discrepancies in fire safety tests that the company used on about five million pickup trucks still on the road. The request by investigators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration follows the opening of a formal inquiry earlier this month that could lead to the recall of full-sized Chevrolet and G.M.C. pickups made from 1973 to 1987.
12/18/1992	G.M. Papers Detail Costs In Plant Shift	The General Motors Corporation believed it would be cheaper in the long run to keep a Michigan assembly plant open, but opted to spend less up front and move production of large cars to Texas, according to company documents. The previously confidential papers were unsealed on Wednesday by Judge Donald Shelton of Washtenaw County Circuit Court in Ann Arbor. They show that G.M. had estimated it would save more than $74 million a year by using the Willow Run plant near Ypsilanti.
12/15/1992	G.M. AND ITS UNION PLAN TO ENCOURAGE EARLY RETIREMENTS	The United Automobile Workers union agreed today to a set of sweeping early-retirement incentives for hourly workers at the General Motors Corporation, signaling that the union recognizes the gravity of the auto maker's problems. The incentives come as the No. 1 auto maker is feverishly cutting costs, closing plants and shrinking itself over all to regain its financial health. All told, the company has announced plans to close nearly two dozen car and parts-making plants over the next several years and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs, the bulk of which are held by union members.
12/12/1992	G.M. DELAYS PRODUCTION OF ELECTRIC CAR	The General Motors Corporation has indefinitely delayed commercial production of its much publicized electric car, previously scheduled to begin in 1995. John Williams, a G.M. spokesman, said hourly workers in Lansing, Mich., that had expected to build the car were notified of this yesterday morning. Mr. Williams said some workers at G.M.'s technical center in Warren, Mich. would also be affected.
12/9/1992	Safety Panel Opens Inquiry Into G.M. Pickups	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation today to determine whether there is a defect in the design of General Motors pickup trucks built from 1973 to 1987 that poses the danger of fire during a crash. The investigation is the first formal step in an administrative proceeding to determine the safety of the popular G.M. pickup truck, a process that could take years to resolve and could cost the automaker and the Government hundreds of millions of dollars. The Federal agency simultaneously solicited public comment for a review of whether standards covering vehicle fuel tanks were tough enough.
12/8/1992	Observer; The Firing Culture	"After years of feeding on strawberries, cream and honey, or tons of money if you'd rather not be poetic about it, corporate executives are suddenly getting fired. Mr. Stempel of General Motors was the most spectacular instance of their new vulnerability. Now Mr. Robinson of American Express is said to be getting the boot. Note that I don't dare breathe the names of these boardroom commanders without calling them """"Mister."""" Such is the awe that corporate giants inspire in those bred to think of them as an elite class. """"Corporate statesmen,"""" they were called in the Eisenhower years. One was invited to kowtow. Now they get fired."
12/8/1992	Electric Car Is Reviewed	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was reviewing its electric-car development program to determine whether to push ahead with commercial production during the next few years. The G.M. statement, issued by a spokesman with little elaboration, suggested that the No. 1 auto maker, pressed by huge financial losses, could either delay or scale back the project, or seek a partner to help bear the costs.
12/5/1992	Insurance Group Asks U.S. to Weigh Recall of G.M. Pickups Prone to Fires	A widely respected insurance industry group yesterday urged Federal officials to consider recalling five million pickup trucks manufactured by the General Motors Corporation, saying the company had misportrayed and had played down the danger of fires in collisions. The industry group, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, also made public a study that supported earlier claims by consumer groups that full-sized Chevrolet and G.M.C. pickups in the model years 1973 through 1987 were far more prone than competitors' vehicles to catch fire in certain accidents. The insurance group blamed a faulty gas tank design.
12/5/1992	Corrections	A front-page article in some copies yesterday referred incorrectly to the General Motors Corporation's vice president for worldwide purchasing. He is Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. (During the preparation of yesterday's article, an identical error was discovered in a front-page article published on Sept. 30; it did not come to The Times's attention then.)
12/4/1992	At Plant, Gray Skies and Pink Slips	"Workers on the day shift streamed out of General Motors Inland Fisher Guide plant here today just as gray clouds and a cold wind were moving in from the west. Hours earlier, in a meeting in the plant cafeteria, they had been told that the plant's 2,200 employees would lose their jobs next year. """"G.M. says 'Merry Christmas,' """" one worker yelled to waiting reporters. """"We'll survive!"""" called another. Yet another carried a homemade sign that read, """"Will work for food."
12/4/1992	G.M. TO SHUT DOWN 7 PARTS FACTORIES IN STRATEGY SHIFT	The General Motors Corporation identified nine plants today that it will close in the next three and a half years, including seven plants that make parts. The announcement makes clear that the giant auto maker's strategy for becoming a leaner company involves increasing its reliance on parts purchased from outside suppliers.
12/3/1992	G.M. Is Set to Announce New Wave of Plant Closings	Officials of the General Motors Corporation acknowledged today that the auto maker would announce the closing of several North American factories on Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not identify which of G.M.'s 100 or so plants would be closed.
12/2/1992	G.M. Retreats on Claims About Fatal Truck Fires	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it may have provided Federal highway officials with potentially misleading statistics to bolster its claims about the safety of millions of pickup trucks now under investigation. Federal officials are deciding whether to recall about five million Chevrolet and G.M.C. full-sized pickup trucks made from 1973 to 1987 because a possible flaw in their fuel tanks makes them a fire hazard.
12/1/1992	G.M. IN NORTH AMERICAN DEAL WITH ITS E.D.S. UNIT	The General Motors Corporation said it had signed a five-year agreement with its Electronic Data Systems Inc. computer subsidiary to provide information processing and communications services to G.M.'s North American vehicle operations. The value of the contract was not disclosed. But an E.D.S. spokesman, Mark Fox, said that G.M. accounted for about 45 percent, or about $3 billion, of E.D.S.'s total revenue.
11/29/1992	Viewpoints; Faulty Lessons From the Boardroom	THE Democratic Party under Bill Clinton has assumed that with the right blend of public policies, American corporations are ready and willing to create jobs and sell new products and services. Nothing could be further from the truth. The election of Mr. Clinton certainly reflects a strong public desire for Federal initiatives to stimulate the economy. Although both leading Presidential candidates put forth policies to foster growth, Mr. Clinton emphasized the need for substantial public investment in job training and infrastructure to create jobs, while President Bush argued for reducing the capital gains tax while maintaining low inflation.
11/26/1992	Honda Cut From U.S. Auto Group	"The United States auto makers' main trade organization today ejected its only Japanese member, the Honda Motor Company. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association explained that it was limiting membership to the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation """"to focus on the common issues and interests that are unique to the domestic manufacturers."""" The action signals that the Big Three plan to strengthen their lobbying efforts on trade and other issues."
11/22/1992	NOV. 15-21: 'Sidesaddle' Gas Tanks; G.M Kept Making Pickups It Could Have Made Safer	"General Motors Corporation, already struggling to right itself financially, was struck another blow last week when internal company documents regarding the safety of millions of its pickup trucks were disclosed in a Federal inquiry and in a Texas suit filed by a consumer group. The G.M. papers show that company officials decided in 1983 that a pickup's fuel tank might be made """"much less vulnerable"""" to leaking during accidents if it were positioned inside the vehicle's main frame. But G.M. did not make that change until its 1988 models, and more than five million pickups with """"sidesaddle"""" tanks are still on the road."
11/21/1992	Officials Did Little, Despite Report Saying U.S. Rule Wasn't Cutting Fatal Car Fires	Two years ago Federal officials concluded that Government fire safety standards for cars and pickup trucks did little to save lives, but no one moved quickly to change them. Recent disclosures about a rash of fatal fires in General Motors pickups have brought a new urgency to the task. Now highway safety officials are scrambling to consider tougher standards. About 1,800 people die and 3,500 more are seriously injured every year in vehicles that crash and catch fire, according to Federal data.
11/19/1992	G.M. to Curtail Dealer Financing and Drop Allante	In another move to shore up its sagging finances, the General Motors Corporation notified its 9,000 dealers today that its General Motors Acceptance Corporation unit would no longer provide wholesale and retail financing for non-G.M. models sold by dealers who also sell General Motors cars. Separately, G.M.'s Cadillac division said it was dropping its Allante two-seater luxury roadster next year, after a seven-year run in which it often fell short of Cadillac's, and owners', expectations.
11/17/1992	Data Show G.M. Knew for Years Of Risk in Pickup Trucks' Design	"The General Motors Corporation recognized as long ago as 1983 that its pickup trucks could be made """"much less vulnerable"""" to collisions that might break open their fuel tanks, according to company documents that have just come to light. But the company did not change the trucks' design until the 1988 model year. The company made its popular Chevrolet and GMC pickups with dual gasoline tanks mounted on the side from 1973 to 1987, and at least six million of them are still on the road. General Motors notes that the vehicles meet all safety standards. It says that in 1988 it changed the way the tanks were mounted for reasons of design, not safety."
11/15/1992	Mr. Pearce's Growing Domain	Seven years ago, the General Motors Corporation's legal department recruited an obscure trial lawyer from Bismarck, N.D., named Harry J. Pearce, who knew G.M. vehicle technology, having defended many product liability cases for the company. Two weeks ago, in the G.M. shake up that elevated John F. (Jack) Smith Jr. to chief executive and John G. Smale to chairman, Mr. Pearce, 50, was the surprise choice to become the executive vice president in charge of G.M.'s two huge nonautomotive assets -- the Electronic Data Systems Corporation and the G.M. Hughes Electronics Corporation.
11/13/1992	G.M. Expects End to Losses By Next Year	The General Motors Corporation's new management team told financial analysts and reporters in New York yesterday that cost-cutting in G.M.'s troubled North American operations was running ahead of schedule, prompting a forecast that losses would be plugged next year. The financial forecast, which is unusual for G.M. or any auto maker, is significant because it suggests that new management, led by John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., is willing to put its credibility and performance on the line.
11/12/1992	Market Place; General Motors' Credibility Check	THE General Motors Corporation's new management, led by John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., will come today to New York for its first meeting with financial analysts. The analysts are looking forward to the session not so much for important disclosures by the company but rather for the new leaders' willingness to be specific. For the last five years, a succession of top G.M. executives, starting with Roger B. Smith, has promised detailed plans to coax healthy financial results out of the nation's largest auto maker. G.M.'s dismal record during much of that period was again recalled on Tuesday when it announced its eighth trip to the equity market in 18 months to raise $1 billion in a new preference stock.
11/11/1992	General Motors Files to Issue $1 Billion in Stock	Saddled with large capital expenditures at the same time it has racked up losses from operations, the General Motors Corporation registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission today to raise up to $1 billion from a new issue of preference stock. Added to G.M.'s seven other equity offerings since June 1991, the issue increases to nearly $8 billion the amount raised in equity markets in less than two years. The company said it expected to offer the first shares of the new issue within a few weeks.
11/10/1992	Swinging the G.M. Ax: Which Plants Are Next?	For John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., the new chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, the hard part is just beginning. By the end of the year, G.M. has said it will name four more assembly plants to be closed as part of its strategy to cut its excess capacity. The four plants will be in addition to the G.M. mini-van plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and Willow Run in Ypsilanti, Mich., where full-size rear-wheel-drive cars are built. These plants were named earlier in the year when G.M. announced 12 of 21 assembly and parts-making factories it planned to close. These were on top of earlier G.M. closing announcements affecting factories like those in Scarborough, Ontario, and the West plant in Pontiac, Mich.
11/9/1992	A G.M. Issue Has Created An Anomaly	IN a world of uncertainties, it is unusual to find one investment that is absolutely certain to be better than a competing investment, no matter what else happens in the world. But that is the case now in General Motors securities. General Motors common stock is clearly a superior investment at current prices relative to one type of G. M. preferred stock, known on Wall Street as a perc, for preferred equity redemption certificate. That will be true if G. M. stock goes up, or if it falls, or if it does nothing.
11/9/1992	Corrections	"A news analysis article in Business Day on Friday about the importance of the General Motors Corporation to the American economy referred erroneously in some editions to remarks made in 1953 by Charles E. Wilson, then president of G.M., during his Senate hearings for confirmation as Secretary of Defense. According to G.M., Mr. Wilson said, """"For years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors and vice versa."
11/8/1992	Viewpoints; The Big Three and Black America	As the General Motors Corporation strives to redefine itself and the Ford Motor Company struggles with a series of quarterly losses, the question must be asked: Does it really matter whether the Big Three supply most of the vehicles sold in the United States? Is it really a cause for concern if imports or the so-called new entrants -- American-based assembly and manufacturing plants owned by foreign auto companies -- sell the lion's share of vehicles here? No matter where you stand on this issue, there is one particularly critical, and often unacknowledged, asset of the traditional industry: the Big Three are a major source of jobs and income for minority Americans.
11/8/1992	Eldorado: Cadillac's High-Tech Platform	WITH the recent flood of bad news from General Motors, including last week's purge of the chairman, Robert C. Stempel, and the announcement of a $753 million loss for the third quarter, it is sometimes hard to remember that the world's largest automobile company does indeed make some pretty good cars. Chevrolet's Corvette, for instance, is a state-of-the-art vehicle. Buick's Park Avenue Ultra is well worth a look. Saturn is earning high marks in all categories. And, while much of today's attention has focused on the imports, G.M. has a long history of innovation after innovation. Oldsmobile has been the test-bed for many of those good ideas. But it is Cadillac that has garnered most of the kudos over the years.
11/7/1992	G.M. SAYS IT WILL KEEP OLDSMOBILE DIVISION	"The General Motors Corporation's new chairman and chief executive said the auto maker's Oldsmobile division """"is here to stay,"""" despite reports that the 95-year old nameplate will be eliminated or merged with another brand. John G. Smale, G.M. chairman, and John F. Smith Jr., G.M. president and chief executive, in separate letters to Dick Smith, head of the Oldsmobile National Dealer Council, said that G.M. was """"totally committed"""" to the future of the division, and that reports about its demise were """"completely without foundation."
11/6/1992	  Is G.M. Fate Still Crucial to U.S.?   	"What is good for the country is good for General Motors, and what's good for General Motors is good for the country,"""" Charles E. Wilson, the G.M. president who was to become President Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, is said to have told the Senate Armed Forces Committee. The pronouncement by Engine Charlie Wilson instantly became a symbol of corporate arrogance for a nation that simultaneously loathed and worshiped big business, for there was rough truth in his words. America was the world's largest consumer of cars, and G.M. was the world's largest producer, a mighty engine of prosperity for G.M. stockholders and the families and communities of workers."
11/5/1992	Union Pins Its Hopes on G.M.'s New Management	"With the General Motors Corporation's newly appointed chief executive officer, John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., signaling that he needs labor's help in changing the company, industry analysts and union officials are hoping for a new era of improved labor relations at the nation's largest auto maker. On Monday, Mr. Smith said he wanted to """"find, cultivate and maintain common ground with union leaders"""" following weeks of rumors and worried speculation that the company's outside board of directors intended to get tough with the United Automobile Workers union. It is still too early, however, to predict what will happen next summer when the company and the union begin negotiating a new contract. 'It Looks Promising' """"The rhetoric certainly goes in the direction of a more cooperative relationship,"""" Harley Shaiken, an industry analyst at the University of California in San Diego, said. """"The statement was designed to defuse rumors and to smooth the way for continued negotiations with the U.A.W. It looks promising in the short term. There is a perception that the U.A.W. is spoiling for a fight. The reality is quite different."
11/5/1992	GENERAL MOTORS UNIT OPENS NEW PLANT IN ENGLAND	The General Motors Corporation's Adam Opel unit of Germany opened a new auto engine plant yesterday in Ellesmere Port, in northern England. The company said it had invested $364.3 million in the plant, which would produce low-emission Ecotec V-6 car engines. Ecotec stands for emission consumption optimization technology. Maximum annual production at the plant, which will employ 450, is estimated at 135,000 engines a year.
11/5/1992	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Oct. 28 about the financial condition of the General Motors Corporation misstated the company's fiscal practices regarding its pension fund. While it is illegal to use pension fund assets to pay for operations, G.M. has employed the common corporate practice of spending on operations cash that might otherwise have been contributed to its pension fund.
11/3/1992	G.M. BOARD MAKES SWEEPING CHANGES IN EXECUTIVE SUITE	The board of the General Motors Corporation, led by a group of independent directors, swept away a generation of top managers yesterday and installed a new management system to try to halt the No. 1 auto maker's pronounced decline. Yesterday's moves strengthened the board's powers over a new and younger team of executives, several of whom led the turnaround of G.M.'s troubled European operations in the 1980's.
11/3/1992	European Perspective for Detroit	"In naming John F. (Jack) Smith Jr. to turn around General Motors, the auto maker's board has chosen a career G.M. executive who is as much an outsider as G.M. could get without actually hiring from the outside. During his 31-year career at G.M., he has spent relatively little time in Detroit, giving him what many believe is a fresh perspective on G.M.'s ills in North America. """"Smith is the right guy at the right time"""" is the refrain echoed over and over in the last week from G.M. executives and industry experts."
11/2/1992	Fast Action Called Key For G.M. Board Meets Today To Name New Chief	When the board of the General Motors Corporation meets this morning in New York, directors are expected to entrust John G. (Jack) Smith Jr. with the task of quickly halting the financial bleeding of the auto giant's North American operations. Whether Mr. Smith can succeed at that daunting task may well depend on whether the board sets reasonable goals for the company's reorganization and whether he moves decisively to change the way G.M. operates. Mr. Smith, who has been G.M.'s president since April, is expected to be named chief executive, replacing Robert C. Stempel, who announced last Monday his plans to resign. Mr. Stempel's other title -- chairman -- is likely to be assumed by a director, John G. Smale, who is a retired chairman of Procter & Gamble.
10/31/1992	Briefs	DAEWOO GROUP, South Korea, announced the formal breakup of its joint venture with General Motors Corp., Detroit. HITACHI LTD., Tokyo, and General Electric Co. have signed an agreement to extend by 15 years an existing manufacturing relationship in gas turbine technology.
10/30/1992	G.M. Had Big Deficit In Quarter	The General Motors Corporation, laboring with excess car-manufacturing capacity and unable to trim costs fast enough, posted a third-quarter loss of $752.9 million, reflecting lower car and truck production in the United States and strikes by the United Automobile Workers union at G.M. plants at Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing, Mich. G.M.'s poor financial results come as the board of the No. 1 auto maker has ousted its chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Stempel, contending that he did not move quickly enough to turn the company around. Still, the financial results represented an improvement over a $1.1 billion loss in the third quarter of last year.
10/30/1992	Resignation Hits a Nerve in Detroit	"With General Motors in turmoil from the assembly line to the executive suite, the tightly knit relationship between """"the General"""" and the Motor City is unraveling in a broad spectrum of emotions. Perhaps nobody knows this better than Robert C. Stempel."
10/29/1992	Is Oldsmobile Name a Marketing Lemon?	"A MONTH after the General Motors Corporation began looking for a new advertising agency to help revive its troubled Oldsmobile division, the company is considering dropping the Olds brand altogether. The Washington Post reported yesterday that General Motors executives were considering phasing out the Oldsmobile name because of consumers' negative feelings toward the 95-year-old car line. An Oldsmobile spokeswoman said dropping the Olds name was not likely, but that it was possible. """"Nothing is sacred, including the name,"""" said Jill Witzenburg, the spokeswoman."
10/29/1992	Corrections	A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the non-employee directors of General Motors Corporation misidentified Edmund T. Pratt Jr. He is chairman emeritus of Pfizer Inc.; he retired as chairman on March 1.
10/29/1992	Fears Over the Post-Stempel Era	Fred Mosley was in his pickup truck Monday morning, making a sandwich run on his break, and brooding, as usual, over the General Motors plant closing next year. Would he be transferred to another plant -- and how long would the next auto plant stay open? Would his wife quit her job and follow him, or would she insist they stick it out in Michigan? Was Bob Stempel in or out?
10/29/1992	Deadline For G.M.'s New Chief	As the General Motors Corporation's board prepares to promote John F. Smith Jr. to chief executive on Monday, directors are signaling that he will have six months to a year to prove he can perform radical surgery on the auto maker. People close to the board said directors had decided for now to exclude non-G.M. candidates from consideration to run the company, though at least one group of former Chrysler executives has discussed its interest in running G.M. with representatives of the G.M. board.
10/28/1992	G.M.'s Financial Erosion Undermined Stempel	The boardroom purge that cost Robert C. Stempel his job as chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation was motivated in large part by the marked deterioration of the auto maker's finances, once the envy of corporate America. Although G.M.'s losses have commanded most of the company's headlines during the past two years, the erosion of other financial measures -- most notably, the underfunding of G.M.'s pension fund by some $12 billion -- have been equally alarming.
10/28/1992	The High-Energy Board Room	"In March, Ross Perot, long removed from his days as a corporate board member, said, """"If there's anything duller than being on a board in Corporate America, I haven't found it."""" Had Mr. Perot still been a member of the board of the General Motors Corporation this week instead of a Presidential candidate, he might have been singing a different tune. When outside directors on the troubled auto maker's board pressed for and finally received the resignation of the chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Stempel, they caused reverberations far beyond Detroit. Many predict that the awakening of the once sleepy G.M. board will redefine the cozy relationship that often exists between the nation's top executives and the hand-picked members of their boards."
10/27/1992	'Car Guy' Who Left Little Mark	"In the end, the """"car guy"""" never got a chance to show what he could do at the General Motors Corporation. The formidable financial difficulties afflicting the auto maker swept away Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive, before he could put his stamp on the company's lineup of cars and trucks. The mood in Detroit yesterday appeared to be one of sadness at the fate of a widely respected man thrust into what turned out to be an impossible situation. Unlike his predecessor, Roger B. Smith, who was often depicted as a hot-tempered tyrant, Mr. Stempel is well-liked by his colleagues, his competitors and rank and file workers."
10/27/1992	An Heir Apparent Who May Leap From Selling Soap to Cars	John G. Smale, the 65-year-old former chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company who has played a leading role in the management shake-up at the General Motors Corporation, is known for having a voracious appetite for tackling thorny problems. But amid speculation that he may take over as chairman of the troubled auto maker from Robert C. Stempel, who resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive, there are questions about whether Mr. Smale can make the leap from selling soap to selling cars.
10/27/1992	President Is Considered Likely Chief	"Since his appointment as General Motors' president six months ago, John F. (Jack) Smith Jr. has kept a low profile in Detroit, huddled in meetings rather than rallying the troops. """"He seems to have kept his nose to the grindstone,"""" one G.M. executive said. That grindstone has yielded plenty of sparks. With many noteworthy changes at the beleaguered auto maker, Mr. Smith has given some executives reason for hope. And with yesterday's resignation of the company's chairman, Robert C. Stempel, many G.M. insiders and company watchers consider Mr. Smith the top candidate for chief executive."
10/27/1992	SHAKE-UP AT G.M.: The Economy's Seat on the Board; Any G.M. Strategy Will Be Dictated by the Weak U.S. Market	No matter who takes over at General Motors as Robert C. Stempel's replacement, or how good he is, the new chairman will be locked into a corporate strategy even before he takes command -- a strategy dictated by the nation's weak economy. Simply stated, G.M. waited too long for ballooning sales to save the day. Americans are buying cars and trucks at an annual rate of barely 13 million a year, far from the 15 million in the late 1980's had created enough demand to mask G.M.'s numerous inefficiencies. And sales are likely to remain weak for months to come.
10/27/1992	Market Place; A Sorry Record for G.M. Stock	The returns say it all: few stocks have been worse lemons in the last 10 years than that of the General Motors Corporation. An investor who bought $100 worth of shares each in G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation at the end of 1982 could not have predicted how widely the returns would vary. Not counting dividends, the $100 invested in Ford would now be worth $465.91. The investment in Chrysler would also have fared well, now being worth $342.25.
10/27/1992	STEMPEL QUITS JOB AS TOP G.M. OFFICER IN RIFT WITH BOARD	Robert C. Stempel resigned today as chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation amid speculation about his imminent dismissal and the failure of the board of the world's largest manufacturer to give him a public vote of confidence. Mr. Stempel's departure, the culmination of several days of reports of a widening rift between him and the board, represented a bitter realization that the apparent campaign against him and his record left him powerless to steer the huge, deeply troubled car-making empire.
10/26/1992	As G.M. Tries to Outrun Past, Critics Ask: Who's in Charge?	The General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest manufacturer, was once renowned for its profitability and vitality. Now it is paralyzed by a crisis that has engulfed the very top of its management. In the last week, General Motors employees and stockholders have awakened to headlines predicting that Robert C. Stempel, the affable, methodical chairman and chief executive, is on the verge of being pushed out by G.M. directors. That has not happened to a ranking G.M. executive since William Crapo Durant, the company's president and one of its founders, was forced out in the 1920's.
10/26/1992	G.M.'s Board Has Aroused Resentment	Whatever happens when the directors of the General Motors Corporation meet next Monday, it already seems clear that the auto maker's 11 outside directors are broadcasting a message that G.M. is not changing fast enough or radically enough. But that message has been emerging in a halting, uneven manner, and many G.M. employees say they are unhappy.
10/24/1992	G.M. Will Consolidate Engineering Groups	The General Motors Corporation, in the midst of a vast slimming of its North American operations, said today that it would consolidate six large car-engineering groups into four. The move will help G.M. cut its white-collar work force to 71,000 by the end of 1993, a reduction of 20,000 jobs from 1991, when the auto maker first said it would close plants and reduce its work force.
10/24/1992	A Caprice That Chevy Couldn't Sell	"Kathy Graham, who oversees market research for new designs at the General Motors Corporation, still recalls the excitement of that day, back in 1989. """"I was told, 'Run out to the front of the building! It's coming!' """" After two years behind locked doors, the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice Classic LTZ sedan, with its curvy lines and voluptuous rear end, was ready for a test drive. The consensus of Ms. Graham and her co-workers was that Charles M. Jordan, G.M.'s design chief, had a winner."
10/23/1992	New Attitude, Not New Boss, The Key, G.M. Watchers Say	For years now, the General Motors Corporation has suffered from a lack of car buyers, but no lack of advice from stock analysts, customers, dealers and automotive experts. For its part, G.M. has announced some drastic plans in the last year, shedding thousands of workers and closing several plants so that it can operate profitably with a smaller share of the American auto market.
10/23/1992	More Doubts on Stempel at G.M.	"John G. Smale, the leader of a group of General Motors Corporation directors pushing for rapid change, fueled speculation today that the chairman of G.M. is about to lose his job. Mr. Smale issued a brief statement that said the board """"has taken no action regarding any management changes at G.M,"""" but he offered no support for Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive officer."
10/22/1992	Challenges Mounting for G.M. Chief	Whether Robert C. Stempel stays or is removed as the chairman and chief executive of the ailing General Motors Corporation, his effectiveness is waning. The growing urgency to streamline G.M.'s costs and operations has ignited speculation and published reports, which General Motors denies, that Mr. Stempel's job is on the line.
10/20/1992	Market Place; Preserving G.M.'s Blue-Chip Credit	WHEN Robert C. Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, was taken to a Washington hospital last week, his illness was diagnosed as hypertension. Fortunately, Mr. Stempel felt well enough to return to work by week's end. But the enormous pressure to restructure G.M. that is swirling about Mr. Stempel and other senior G.M. executives will not dissipate as quickly.
10/17/1992	G.M. Expects Smaller Loss For 3d Period	The General Motors Corporation, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, confirmed today what Wall Street has been bracing for: another quarter of large financial losses. The loss won't be quite so large, however, as the $1.06 billion deficit the leading auto maker posted for the third quarter of 1991. G.M. said it expected a 20 percent improvement or better, which indicates a loss that could amount to $845 million for 1992's third period.
10/17/1992	G.M. Yields and Will Provide Truck-Crash Data	The General Motors Corporation has suffered a setback in a deepening legal battle over the design of pickup trucks it built from 1973 to 1987 and fatal fires arising from accidents involving some of those trucks. Critics say that fires resulting from gasoline-tank ruptures in collisions have been responsible for more than 100 deaths. G.M., which insists that the vehicles meet all safety standards, has acknowledged to the Government that it is a defendant in more than 100 lawsuits in connection with the tank design.
10/14/1992	COMPANY NEWS: Employee Benefits; G.M. Executive Becomes Card-Carrying Celebrity	"As a tool for motivating an employee, imagine the effectiveness of this approach: Hire someone to develop an important new product, spend more than $50 million to promote it and display the employee's name in large type in every piece of advertising. Sounds effective? Just ask Ronald N. Zebeck, who joined the General Motors Corporation last year from the Advanta Corporation to develop the auto maker's Mastercard, which was introduced in early September and has already attracted one million new accounts. """"They've attached my skin to it,"""" he said."
10/14/1992	Pressure On to Stop Slide at G.M.	Pressure is mounting for executives of the General Motors Corporation to take swifter, bolder action to stop further deterioration of the giant auto maker's ailing North American operations. With the economy stalled and some union locals fighting attempts to consolidate jobs, G.M. is facing losses of $4 billion to $5 billion in North America this year, according to analysts, after losing more than $7 billion last year.
10/13/1992	Board Is Said To Warn G.M.	"The General Motors Corporation's outside directors have urged the company's chairman, Robert C. Stempel, to stand up to the United Automobile Workers' union and to step up the pace of streamlining the company or risk losing his own job, perhaps by the end of the year, The Washington Post reported in today's issue. The Post article, citing company sources, said the """"get tough"""" message was delivered to Mr. Stempel and other top managers at a meeting of the board last week in New York."
10/12/1992	Oldsmobile Begins Its Agency Review	The Oldsmobile division of the General Motors Corporation is beginning to narrow the list of agencies it will consider as it reviews its account, estimated at $110 million to $140 million and now at Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago. Advertising executives who insisted on anonymity said Oldsmobile managers would visit about a half-dozen shops later this month and early next month, including Ayer Inc. in Detroit and New York; W. B. Doner & Company in Baltimore and Southfield, Mich.; Deutsch Inc. in New York; Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York, and Tatham Euro RSCG in Chicago. Burnett is also participating in the review.
10/12/1992	A Test for Women Who Build Cars	After everything they have been through, after all the victories won so slowly over the years, there is one more test for the women of General Motors. Sometime next year, the company's Willow Run assembly plant here will shut forever. Seniority is everything when it comes to jobs at other plants, and the women have less of it than their male co-workers. Now, as she has to be strong all over again, Kelly Arter finds it helpful to remember the foreman she took on 14 years ago. She had just moved up from assembler to replacement operator, the only woman on the job.
10/11/1992	Moving Out the Cars With a 'No-Dicker Sticker'	Robert Fisher watched sales at his two Reading, Pa., dealerships slide for a couple of years. It was time to change or go out of business. He cut his sales force to three people from nine and on Labor Day began selling his Chevrolets and Oldsmobiles in a new way: no negotiating over the price. In the first month, sales rose to 207 vehicles from 115 the previous month. And while he made less money on each car -- an average of $700, down from $1,100, he said -- overall profits rose because he increased volume and cut his payroll by so much. For example, he said, his Bob Fisher Chevrolet dealership earned $13,000 in September, compared with a loss of $1,190 in August.
10/11/1992	Pontiac's Grand Prix: 30 Years of Flash	IT'S hard to believe, but 1992 marks the 30th anniversary of the Grand Prix, the popular Pontiac that had a lot to do with improving automotive architecture in the latter part of the 1960's and beyond. That first GP, vintage 1962, has been pretty much forgotten, but the re-do a year later is the one that a lot of people remember, given its tasteful looks and crisp shape.
10/9/1992	G.M. Issues Millionth Card	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had signed its millionth credit card account this week, less than a month after introducing its G.M. Mastercard on Sept. 9.
10/8/1992	Problems Emerge in U.S.-Japan Auto Deal	"Nine months after President Bush declared that his trade mission to Tokyo had yielded a milestone agreement to sell 20,000 more American cars in Japan every year, one major deal to implement the accord appears to have gone off track. A deal between the world's two largest car makers, under which Toyota would sell General Motors cars to the Japanese public, had been hailed by Mr. Bush's aides during the ill-fated January trip as a prime example of how the Administration was coming home with what the President had termed """"jobs, jobs, jobs"""" for Americans."
10/8/1992	G.M. Faces Third Strike Threat in a Month	For the third time in the last month, the leadership of the United Automobile Workers has authorized a strike against a crucial General Motors production center, ostensibly over working conditions. If negotiations fail, the 3,400 hourly workers at the two Inland Fisher Guide plants in Anderson, Ind., could be on strike by next Wednesday. Since the plants supply tail lights, turn signal lights and other exterior lighting to all 28 G.M. assembly plants in North America, a strike there could cripple overall G.M. production.
10/6/1992	General Motors Promotes Two	The General Motors Corporation elected two vice presidents at a board meeting today. Bruce G. MacDonald, 53 years old, was promoted to vice president for corporate communications. He had been executive in charge of the corporate communications staff when it was restructured in July.
10/6/1992	G. M. Productivity Trails Domestic Rivals'	A study of the United States automobile industry's manufacturing productivity, due to be released this week, showed today that the General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, has fallen further behind its domestic rivals during the last two years. The Ford Motor Company continues to lead G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation in productivity, but since 1989 Chrysler has pulled away from G.M. and closer to Ford, according to James Harbour, president of Harbour & Associates of Troy, Mich., manufacturing consultants.
10/2/1992	Hard Times Change Many Minds	Union officials at General Motors' Willow Run assembly plant here have long complained about growing political apathy among the rank and file. But not this year. Their plant has been scheduled for closing, and the workers blame George Bush (along with the chairman of G.M., whose selection they don't get to vote on). Bill Clinton wasn't the union local's first choice for President (Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa was) or even its second (Edmund G. Brown Jr. from California was). But workers have been registering to vote in record numbers just so they can back the Democrat in November.
9/30/1992	Why G.M. Buyer Unnerves Suppliers	The hype is the billions of dollars annually that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriotua promises he will save the General Motors Corporation in lower outlays for parts and materials. The cold reality is embodied in a nondescript factory here that makes millions of seat belts every year for Cadillacs, Buicks, Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles. As G.M.'s new vice president of worldwide purchasing, Mr. Lopez and his lieutenants rearranged machines and workers on the assembly lines at the General Safety Corporation. The changes, said Alfred J. Fisher 3d, General Safety's president, yielded double-digit improvements in productivity.
9/29/1992	ROCKWELL SAID TO QUIT G.M. ELECTRIC-VEHICLE PROGRAM	The Rockwell International Corporation has pulled out of the General Motors Corporation's electric-vehicle program, apparently angry over having to rebid on its contract with the auto maker, Automotive News reported yesterday. Rockwell was to be the sole supplier for the car's plastic body panels, the weekly trade publication said. Both G.M. and Rockwell declined to confirm the report. G.M. has said it will mass-produce an electric car at a plant in Lansing, Mich., sometime in the mid-1990's.
9/26/1992	3,000 on Strike at G.M. Plant; 2d Labor Dispute in a Month	About 3,000 workers walked off their jobs today at a General Motors Corporation plant in Lansing, Mich. The striking workers, members of the United Automobile Workers union, build bodies for the Oldsmobile Achieva, Buick Skylark and Pontiac Grand Am models. An additional 4,200 G.M. workers in Lansing, who make chassis for the cars, were idled shortly thereafter.
9/25/1992	G.M. Official Will Become A Top Executive at Textron	When rising corporate stars get job offers from other companies, making decisions about what to do generally takes some time. Lewis B. Campbell is an exception to that rule. On Wednesday, less than 24 hours after it had extended an offer, Textron Inc., the conglomerate based in Providence, R.I., announced that it had lured Mr. Campbell away from his position as vice president and general manager of the GMC Truck division of the General Motors Corporation to become its chief operating officer.
9/25/1992	Oldsmobile's Review Casts a Shadow Over Leo Burnett	ARE there worms in those shiny apples that have become emblematic of the Leo Burnett Company? No one is suggesting the Chicago advertising giant known for giving away apples -- reminders of its eponymous founder, whose secretary put out a bowl of apples the day Burnett opened in 1935 -- will soon be selling them on street corners.
9/24/1992	Hearing the Fears, With No Answers	If the General Motors Willow Run Assembly Plant, with 4,000 hourly workers, is a small town, then Bob Harlow is the mayor. He is the president of the auto workers' Local 1776. Only now, his town is going out of business. The cars it has been building will be produced instead in Arlington, Tex. Bob Harlow's people are scared about their futures. They want answers. When is the plant going to close? Should we move to Arlington? How do they treat blacks in Texas? If we don't go, will we get picked up at other plants in Michigan? How long will Arlington stay open? What about early retirement? What's going to happen after the contract expires? Why are they closing our plant?
9/21/1992	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising HEADLINE>G.M. May Drop an Ad Agency	In its clearest signal yet of its determination to change its marketing, the General Motors Corporation is reviewing its Oldsmobile advertising and considering a change in agencies after 25 years with Leo Burnett U.S.A.. Oldsmobile executives last week notified the Burnett office in Chicago that they would consider other agencies for their estimated $100 million to $110 million in annual advertising.
9/19/1992	G.M. to Speed Cuts in Work Force	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would speed up its plan to shrink its salaried work force in the United States. It also told nearly 200,000 retirees and salaried American workers how much they must pay for health-care benefits starting in January. Salaried G.M. workers, who were told in late August that one of the most generous health-care packages in American industry would become less so, got the details today in a closed-circuit television address by Robert C. Stempel, the G.M. chairman; John F. Smith Jr., the president and chief operating officer, and Richard F. O'Brien, the vice president of personnel.
9/17/1992	G.M. and Other Companies Quit Tokyo Stock Market	In a blow to Tokyo's standing as a world financial center, the General Motors Corporation and four other large foreign companies announced separately today that they would stop selling their shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The decisions seemed to signal a reversal of a trend of the last half of the 1980's, when many global-minded American and European companies rushed to list their shares here in hopes of increasing their international prestige and raising money in Tokyo's generous capital markets. From 1984 to 1991, the number of foreign companies selling shares on the Tokyo exchange rose to 125 from 11.
9/17/1992	U.S.-China Rift at Trade Talks Is Still Wide	American and Chinese negotiators concluded a third day of talks today on a number of contentious trade issues, but the two sides remained far apart on what could prove a landmark trade agreement. The United States has given China until Oct. 10 to agree to lower a range of import barriers or face punitive tariffs against $3.9 billion worth of Chinese exports to the United States. China has threatened to retaliate by raising tariffs on $4 billion worth of imports of American goods if the United States imposes sanctions.
9/16/1992	With New Design Chief, G.M. Quiets Speculation	The General Motors Corporation named Wayne K. Cherry its new vice president of design staff today, filling a key position that oversees how all G.M. cars and trucks look, as well as their comfort and styling characteristics. The appointment ended months of speculation over who would succeed Charles M. Jordan, who will turn 65 years old next month and then retire. Mr. Jordan, G.M.'s fourth design chief since the position was created by the legendary G.M. chairman Alfred Sloan in 1940, served as head of design since October 1986.
9/13/1992	FORUM; G.M. Should Start Imitating Chrysler	On the face of it, the recently settled strike at the General Motors Corporation's Lordstown, Ohio, stamping facility was about outsourcing -- purchasing parts from independent suppliers. But the real issue behind the strike was far more fundamental: G.M.'s survival and its blueprint for the future. For decades, G.M.'s vertically integrated, multi-divisional structure was a world beater. It permitted long-range planning in combination with staggering economies of scale. And in theory, executives could control costs by going to outside suppliers if the internal divisions failed to perform.
9/13/1992	Raising the Stakes In a War of Plastic	The plastic thicket of credit cards has grown denser in the last two weeks with announcements from General Motors and General Electric that they will market new cards. More junk mail can be disorienting for anyone trying to find the best terms available, but the new cards are nevertheless welcome news for consumers. Taken together, they provide a good indication of how the growing competition in the business has forced credit-card issuers, including a growing number of companies that are not banks, to offer better terms to attract or hold on to customers.
9/13/1992	Car Dealer's Guilty Plea Adds to Corruption Taint	For more than 20 years, rumors and accusations have floated around the Town of Brookhaven, L.I., about corruption and cozy relations between local officials and favored developers. Last week, the rumors took on new credibility with the court admission by John McNamara, a car dealer, that he had engaged in a scheme to defraud General Motors of $6 billion in loans and used some of the money to bribe Brookhaven officials to gain approvals for real-estate ventures.
9/11/1992	Auto Dealer Plea Deal Is Called Good for U.S.	The plea bargain in which a Long Island car dealer admitted bilking General Motors of $6 billion and promised to help prosecute public officials he said he bribed was cited by criminal lawyers and other legal experts yesterday as an apparently good deal for Federal prosecutors. The experts said the Government gave away only a conditional pledge to recommend leniency and may have opened a wedge against corruption in Suffolk County and perhaps in the auto industry as well. The lawyers and legal experts said the value of the bargain would ultimately depend on the extent and quality of the evidence provided by the car dealer, John McNamara, who said he had bribed planning, zoning and other officials in the Town of Brookhaven, a member of the Port Jefferson Planning Board and a State Transportation Department official.
9/10/1992	G.M.'s Bold Move Into Credit Cards	The credit card introduced yesterday by the General Motors Corporation brandishes a long list of features that make it, some industry analysts say, the most important new national card since A.T.& T. introduced its Universal card in March 1990. Good news for consumers, bad news for competitors. The features are a sign that consumers stand to benefit from the growing competition among banks and nonbanks for trustworthy credit risks. G.M.'s card, whose primary mission is to help the auto maker sell cars by building brand loyalty through offering rebates, is likely to take a toll on some smaller players and continue the consolidation under way among credit card companies. In the last five years, the market share of the top 10 card issuers has increased to 51.5 percent from 37 percent.
9/9/1992	G.M. Expected to Announce Details of New Credit Card	Think of it as a frequent drivers card. The General Motors Corporation is expected to make a widely anticipated announcement today that it will issue a new Mastercard and possibly a Visa credit card designed to build loyalty among car buyers.
9/8/1992	G.M. Set to Reopen Plants	The General Motors Corporation will reopen assembly plants in Spring Hill, Tenn., and Lordstown, Ohio, on Tuesday as it resumes auto production halted by a nine-day strike at a parts factory. About 6,000 workers will return to work at the Spring Hill plant, which makes the popular Saturn cars, a G.M. spokeswoman, Linda Cook, said. The plant was the first to shut down after workers at a Lordstown parts plant went on strike on Aug. 27.
9/8/1992	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a news analysis article in Business Day yesterday about the end of the United Automobile Workers' strike at the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, misidentified a union official, Stephen Yokich. He is vice president for the union's G.M. department.
9/7/1992	American Dream Put on Hold at Car Plant Doomed to Shut	"The day a General Motors manager stood on a stage at the Willow Run assembly plant here and told 2,000 workers the line would shut down forever by the fall of 1993, Chuck Kehrer watched as the man next to him bolted for the nearest trash can and threw up. """"The two women next to me went white,"""" said Mr. Kehrer, who 22 years ago went from high school to a job as a spot welder in the body shop. """"People were crying and running out. I didn't cry. I just had an empty feeling. I felt very, very sad. I felt as if the Titanic was going down, and everyone was running for the lifeboats, and the lifeboats had holes."
9/7/1992	Little Gain for Union	It is hard to see what the United Automobile Workers union gained from the nine-day walkout at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant that idled more than 40,000 workers nationwide. When the auto workers struck, they said their goal was to force the company to keep open a tool-and-die shop that provides 240 jobs and that G.M. wanted to close. Under the agreement overwhelmingly ratified on Saturday, the company agreed to keep the shop open only for a few additional months.
9/6/1992	Auto Workers End Walkout Against G.M.	Striking workers at a General Motors parts plant in Lordstown, Ohio, overwhelmingly approved an agreement today to end the nine-day strike that had shut much of the auto maker's domestic production and idled more than 40,000 workers nationwide. At a meeting in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, 98 percent of the workers voting approved the deal, officials of the United Automobile Workers union said. Union and company spokesmen said they expected workers to begin returning to their jobs tonight.
9/4/1992	G.M.'s Cuts to Extend Beyond Union Ranks	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that 95,000 white-collar workers would not receive bonuses this year and has agreed that jobs at a plant in Mexico will be sacrificed before cutbacks affect a similar plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The two separate developments suggest that G.M. is trying to emphasize that not only unionized plant workers in the United States will suffer as the company reduces its production capacity.
9/2/1992	G.M. Ultimatum to Parts Makers Brings Showdown With Workers	United Automobile Workers, meet Jack Smith, Inaki Lopez and G.M.'s new cost-cutting team. The spreading strike at the General Motors Corporation, which now involves more than 30,000 workers at seven plants, is the first concerted reaction by G.M. workers to the company's campaign to cut costs and reduce its work force by 74,000 people by 1995. The strike is threatening to affect nearly twice as many plants and workers by the end of this week.
9/1/1992	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Saturday about a new General Motors stock issue described the dividends of GM Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors, incorrectly. They are paid by General Motors, not the subsidiary.
8/31/1992	Assets of Auto Dealer in Fraud Case to Be Sold	The extensive business assets of John McNamara, the Long Island auto dealer accused of defrauding General Motors of more than $400 million, are now for sale, and his 6,000 creditors, including the tax collector, are standing in line. Once known as a philanthropist and major contributor to the Republican Party, Mr. McNamara remains free on $300 million bail. But the 52-year-old businessman has become even more reclusive than usual, seldom seen by friends and former business associates in this quaint waterfront village of 7,500 residents. He has been advised by his lawyer to avoid making any public comments.
8/29/1992	G.M. Details Plan to Issue More Shares	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would issue 25 million new G.M. class H shares and use the proceeds to pay for its previously announced acquisition of the General Dynamics Corporation's missile business. The stock sale might also generate some fresh capital for G.M., depending on demand for the stock and its price when the offering takes place. In composite trading, G.M.'s class H stock closed at $23.375 today, down $1.125 a share, on volume of 86,300 shares.
8/29/1992	Strike at General Motors Plant Shuts Down Production of Some Car Models	Hourly workers struck a General Motors Corporation metal fabricating plant in Lordstown, Ohio, today, sending a tremor through G.M. assembly operations. G.M.'s Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., anticipating a shortage of parts made in Lordstown, was scheduled to stop making cars early Friday. More G.M. assembly plants could shut within days, but the auto maker declined to say which would be affected.
8/28/1992	G.M. Parts Plant Struck; Saturn Halt Is Seen	One of the most generous health-care packages in American business became a little less so today, as the General Motors Corporation informed salaried workers and retirees that they must bear more of the expense, including paying monthly premiums. The cost-cutting move sets the stage for what are certain to be tense negotiations next year with the United Automobile Workers union, during which G.M. will seek to reduce its health-care costs.
8/26/1992	G.M. Orders Staff to Pay Part of Health-Care Cost	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had an operating profit of $392 million in the second quarter -- its most heartening quarterly showing in two years. The company reported a net loss of $357.1 million for the quarter because of the previously announced charge of $749.4 million by its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. The operating earnings reflected increased factory sales of cars and trucks to dealers, as well as cost savings from G.M.'s reorganized North American automotive operations, said Robert C. Stempel, the company chairman.
8/7/1992	Operations Show Profit For G.M.	The General Motors Corporation's three nonautomotive subsidiaries posted mixed second-quarter financial results today. But their cumulative performance was sharply lower than last year's because of a $749.4 million restructuring charge reported six weeks ago by G.M.'s Hughes Aircraft unit. G.M. will report overall second-quarter results Thursday. Analysts expect Hughes's one-time write-off to leave the auto maker with a loss of several hundred million dollars in the quarter.
8/6/1992	G.M. Subsidiaries Report Mixed Results for 2d Period	The General Motors Corporation's Saturn subsidiary said it expects prices on its 1993 models to increase $789, to $13,212, from the 1992 model year. A driver's air bag, a $625 option for 1992, will be standard on all 1993 models, the company said. Comparably equipped, Saturn's 1993 models cost 2.5 percent more than the 1992's.
7/21/1992	U.A.W. Attacks G.M. Plans for Tarrytown Plant	PHILIP GUARASCIO just wanted to talk about soccer. But an overflow audience of reporters, G.M. watchers and automotive enthusiasts had weightier matters to kick around. Mr. Guarascio, who on Tuesday was named general manager of marketing and advertising for General Motors' North American operations, was the star attraction yesterday at a monthly luncheon meeting of the International Motor Press Association.
7/16/1992	SATURN UNIT WILL SPEND $48 MILLION AT PLANT	The General Motors Corporation's Saturn subsidiary said it would invest $48 million to upgrade and expand its Spring Hill, Tenn., plant to produce 1993 models. Saturn also said it would close the Spring Hill plant Monday for two weeks to change over to 1993-model production. G.M.'s other North American vehicle assembly plants will also close for those two weeks as part of an annual vacation shutdown imposed in December to cut costs at the giant auto maker.
7/15/1992	New Shifts At G.M.'s Top Levels	Dropping another shoe in the restructuring of its North American operations, the General Motors Corporation yesterday announced an overhaul of its marketing and communications staff that for the first time has resulted in the departure of a vice president and group executive. Marina v.N. Whitman, who led the public affairs and marketing group and was the auto maker's most senior female executive, will retire Sept. 1 to teach at the University of Michigan. G.M. eliminated a second layer of management in its marketing staff with the departure of James B. Fitzpatrick, vice president of marketing and communications, who will retire in September.
7/12/1992	Wall Street; Is There a Future for Dissidents?	When the outside directors of the General Motors Corporation reprimanded the management of the troubled car maker in April, pundits predicted that the uprising would embolden the directors of other sleeping giants and improve the chances that investors will benefit. But one interesting test of how far such muscle-flexing will spread is whether the G.M. dissidents are being offered positions on other corporate boards, and the early indication is that the careers of the G.M. directors are not being cut short.
7/11/1992	G.M. IN TALKS ON PLANT IN BASQUE AREA	The General Motors Corporation said it was in talks with the Government officials about a vehicle manufacturing plant in Vizcaya province, in northern Spain's Basque region. No decision has been made, a G.M. spokeswoman said. She did not give a timetable for the final decision on possible investment. The spokeswoman was answering questions linked to a report in today's El Pais newspaper that said G.M. might invest 60 billion pesetas ($632 million) in a Vizcaya plant to make sports cars. She was unable to give a planned investment figure, nor could she say what type of vehicles were planned.
7/9/1992	G.M. Signs an Accord With Environmentalists	"In an unusual expression of detente between industry and environmentalists, General Motors and the Environmental Defense Fund announced yesterday that they had signed an agreement to hold formal discussions on environmental issues. """"Over the last 20 years, it's been each side preaching to the heathen on the other side,"""" said Joseph Goffman, a lawyer with the environmental group. """"We've decided to skip the great conversion speeches and talk about what we can talk about."
7/3/1992	Finance Unit At G.M. Taps 2 for Key Jobs	The General Motors Corporation's financing unit today named two executives to posts it created to prevent scandals like its loss of $436 million in what authorities contend was a Long Island car dealer's fraud scheme. Separately, G.M. named the former president of the financing unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, to a top post in its auto parts operation. The official, William J. Lovejoy, was removed from his previous post in a June 12 management shake-up, after the fraud charges against the dealer were filed.
7/2/1992	Hughes Fails to Fulfill Hopes Of G.M. for Counterbalance	It was for times like these, when auto sales are slow, that the General Motors Corporation bought the Hughes Aircraft Company six years ago. Pentagon orders for military goods, it was reasoned, could be counted on regardless of lean economic times. What was not foreseen, however, was the full impact of the end of the cold war.
6/28/1992	G.M. Layoff Raises Employee Fears	"THE announcement by General Motors that 800 employees on the night shift here will be laid off in August has heightened workers' fears about the scheduled closing of the assembly plant three summers from now. Union officials say that unless retraining programs are implemented soon, the factory's 3,100 hourly workers, who will be hard pressed to transfer their skills elsewhere, may find themselves jobless. """"There's lots of stress,"""" said Peter Donnelly, a benefits representative for United Auto Workers Local 664. """"Our careers, our lives are on the line. The vast majority of us want to continue working. We don't want to go on welfare."
6/28/1992	The Patriarch of American Luxury	WHEN it comes to automobiles, it is hard to say what sparks brand loyalty. What makes you, for instance, a Ford guy? Or a Plymouth person? Or why are you passionate about Chevies? It may be that you have heard good things. Or that you like the lines. Or, in my case, that you just wanted to one-up your father. That's how I wound up with my first Cadillac, used but almost new -- and a year newer than Dad's '59 Lincoln.
6/26/1992	When Car Makers Retaliate Against Critical Magazines	"READERS of the August issue of Automobile magazine may notice an advertisement from Buick and another from Oldsmobile, signifying the magazine's emergence from the doghouse, where the General Motors Corporation now and then banishes miscreants. G.M. had sentenced Automobile to three months without advertising after the magazine's editor, David E. Davis Jr., delivered a scathing attack against the auto maker in a speech in January. Mr. Davis rebuked G.M. at the annual black-tie gala of the Washington Automotive Press Association, expressing dismay at G.M.'s announcement that it was closing 21 plants and eliminating 74,000 jobs. He contrasted G.M. management with the industry's founding fathers, calling the heirs """"piano players in whorehouses."
6/25/1992	U.S. Trade Agency Turns Down Car Makers' Complaint on Japan	The Federal Government's trade agency ruled today that Detroit's auto makers had not suffered significant harm from imported Japanese mini-vans, a verdict that prevents the Commerce Department from proceeding with plans to impose tariffs on the imports. The decision by the independent agency, the International Trade Commission, to reject a highly political case is a landmark in American trade policy. It reflects the presence of a new majority, more skeptical of industry claims, on the little-known body, which has the power to block American industries from receiving Commerce Department protection from imports. A Former Member's Analysis Three new commissioners -- two Republicans and a Democrat -- have joined the six-member body in recent months, and the two Republicans appear to be taking a much narrower interpretation of the nation's trade law than their predecessors. Their terms will last as long as nine years.
6/18/1992	Ford and Chrysler Outpace Japanese in Reducing Costs	Ford and Chrysler have increased the efficiency of their factories and workers so much in recent years that their basic cost of producing a car is now less than that of their Japanese rivals, according to a study published today. Auto analysts have long recognized the productivity improvements at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation. But the assumption within the industry has been that a production-cost gap remains between Detroit's second- and third-largest auto makers and the Japanese car companies, especially the Toyota Motor Corporation, generally regarded as the low-cost producer worldwide.
6/18/1992	G.M. Names President For Its Japan Division	The General Motors Corporation has named J. Michael Durrie president of GM Japan, handing him one of the toughest assignments at the world's largest auto maker: expand sales in Japan roughly tenfold in the next decade. In an interview from a hotel in Tokyo, Mr. Durrie, who is 54 years old, conceded that he faced formidable obstacles. The cars that General Motors sells in Japan -- including the Cadillac Seville, Pontiac Grand Am, Chevrolet Camaro and Buick Park Avenue -- carry a premium of between 20 and 50 percent over their price in the United States because of the costs of transportation, inspection and distribution.
6/16/1992	LOTUS CARS PLANS TO STOP MAKING $40,000 ELAN ROADSTER	"The Lotus Cars Ltd. division of the General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would stop producing its $40,000 Elan roadster, ending an effort by the British sports car maker to revive its fortunes by selling a lower-priced model. """"The Elan was introduced into the weakest high-end sports car market in recent history,"""" Lotus said in a letter to its dealers, adding that it could not make the Elan """"at a price that makes it a profitable element of our business."
6/12/1992	For Many, No Surprise In Turmoil	"In the four-year-old office building where Louis Phelps and his staff processed thousands of financing applications from John McNamara for cars that did not exist, news of the shake-up at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation came as no surprise. John A. Crockett, an agent for the New York Life Insurance Company, which has offices and holds the mortgage on the building, said the rumor mill in the basement coffee shop had been buzzing for weeks about the trouble soon to visit the G.M.A.C. office. 'There Should Have Been Flags' Mr. Crockett questioned General Motors' finding that there was no evidence of wrongdoing in the granting of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of loans to Mr. McNamara's dealership in Port Jefferson Station. """"They may say that, but maybe they should have done a little more investigating,"""" he said. """"There should have been flags."
6/12/1992	COMPANY NEWS: A $22,800 Economy Car; G.M. Begins Selling The Saturn in Taiwan	In its first year of production, G.M.'s Saturn has proved quite a popular car in the United States among buyers and dealers. Now the Saturn Corporation is looking abroad. Yesterday the General Motors unit began selling its Saturn coupes and sedans in Taiwan. Taiwan represents Saturn's first export market and a first step in a strategy to export cars to Japan by the mid-1990's and then to other foreign countries.
6/12/1992	Shake-Up at G.M.A.C. in Wake of L.I. Fraud Case	Moving to restore confidence after being victimized by a fraud prosecutors say was committed by a Buick dealer and was one of the biggest at a financial institution, the General Motors Corporation today removed two top executives of its financing arm. It is also removing current and former managers of the finance unit's branch office in Hauppauge, L.I., which supervised the accounts of the indicted dealer, John M. McNamara. Mr. McNamara, a respected figure on Long Island until his arrest on April 15, pleaded not guilty last week to charges that he had defrauded G.M. of $436 million. A Stunning Departure Prosecutors say that over a period of seven years he forged documents indicating that he had sold 70,000 customized vans to customers in the Middle East. General Motors lent him millions of dollars based on those documents. In its indictment, the Government said the vehicles never existed.
6/9/1992	Accord on Auto Research	The Big Three auto makers said today that they had agreed to form a consortium to share technology for controlling auto emissions. The agreement by Chrysler, Ford and General Motors is the eighth such cooperative accord the auto makers have signed in the last few years. Their goal is to share noncompetitive technology in order to save costs and compete more effectively with foreign auto makers. A 1969 consent decree barring car makers from sharing research and development expired in 1987.
6/9/1992	G.M. Cost Cutter Sharpens His Ax	"A revolution in the way cars are made that started in a small, nondescript office building in a suburb of this Swiss city is sweeping the General Motors Corporation. Its code word, coined by a Spaniard, is """"Picos."""" Repeated like a shibboleth by executives at G.M.'s modest European headquarters, Picos is short for """"program for improvement and cost optimization of suppliers."""" In essence, the term covers the mix of ruthless probing, consultation, orders and ultimatums that J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua used to slash the cost of parts for G.M. Europe, making it hugely profitable while its Detroit-based parent piled up losses."
6/8/1992	Forces Join to End Crippling Crashes	Even an exciting finish -- in which Al Unser Jr. beat Scott Goodyear by .043 seconds, the closest margin ever for the Indianapolis 500 -- could not diminish the sense that this May was a bad one at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Rookie driver Jovy Marcelo died, three-time world champion Nelson Piquet had his career ended by a practice crash, and Jeff Andretti, Mario Andretti's son, suffered serious leg and foot injuries. And that was merely the worst of it.
6/4/1992	G.M. Selling Its 50% Stake in Robotics Unit	"The General Motors Corporation, as part of a push to improve its finances and concentrate on building cars and trucks, said today that it was selling its 50 percent interest in a robotics venture, the GMFanuc Robotics Corporation. G. M. also said that it held meetings here Tuesday with about 600 top suppliers to its North American automotive operations to announce intiatives to drive down the costs of building vehicles in North America. J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, G. M.'s new purchasing director, told suppliers that """"we are looking at everything,"""" a G. M. spokeswoman, Antonette Simonetti, said."
6/3/1992	L.I. Dealer Pleads Not Guilty To G.M. Loan Fraud Charges	John McNamara, the Long Island auto dealer and real-estate developer accused of defrauding General Motors of more than $400 million, pleaded not guilty yesterday to Federal racketeering and fraud charges. Mr. McNamara, a tall man who has a wide, jowly face and who wore a dark pinstriped suit, showed no emotion as he entered his plea in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
5/27/1992	The Democrats, Standing Small	The European Community has taken what might be a historic step against protectionist farm policies. How are House Democratic leaders responding to this dramatic opportunity for trade? They're proposing a giant leap backward, sponsoring a bill that could victimize American workers in Japanese-owned auto factories, provoke Europe to retaliate against U.S. exports and undermine trade talks. Dan Rostenkowski, the usually sensible chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, as they anticipate the elections are eager to portray their party as standing tall, ready to bully trade partners into submission. That's an ignoble purpose. Protectionism would jack up car prices and shower Chrysler, Ford and General Motors with windfall profits. It won't create jobs or prosperity.
5/24/1992	A G.M. Success And A Relief for Wall Street	It worked. The pricing of stock offerings, especially large ones, is an art. And for a day it looked as if General Motors and its lead underwriter, Morgan Stanley, had pushed too far when they decided to raise the amount of stock being sold.
5/23/1992	G.M. Holders Question Officials on Fraud Report	Questions from angry General Motors Corporation shareholders about the suspected $436 million fraud by a Long Island car dealer dominated the auto maker's annual meeting today. The controversy over G.M.'s internal financial controls came as Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, sought to reassure shareholders that last month's shake-up of top management was intended to speed G.M.'s troubled North American operations back to profitability.
5/22/1992	CHEVROLET GIVES THE CAPRICE A REPRIEVE THROUGH 1995	Chevrolet will keep six-passenger family-size cars like the Caprice in its lineup through the 1990's even as the General Motors Corporation focuses on fewer nameplates, a GM executive said. The Caprice, whose future was placed in doubt by the consolidation of all of G.M.'s production of large rear-wheel-drive cars in Arlington, Tex., was given a reprieve through at least 1995. Chevrolet's chief engineer, Dave Hansen, declined to name other surviving cars. But he said that beginning in 1994, the division would focus its marketing dollars on one car a year in each market segment.
5/21/1992	Big G.M. Issue Lands, and Price Holds Up	"Shares of the General Motors Corporation barely budged yesterday, slipping 25 cents, to $39, as the stock market tried to digest 55 million new shares of the company's stock. Traders said Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter for Tuesday's huge offering, was """"supporting"""" the stock, meaning it was actively buying shares at the $39 offering price to keep the price from falling. Trading volume was extremely heavy, with nearly 17 million shares changing hands. G.M. was the most active issue by far on the New York Stock Exchange, and Morgan Stanley was said to have bought more than half of those shares."
5/21/1992	Accountant Plans Sale Of Auto Dealer's Assets	"This is not going to be a fire sale,"""" said Dominic DiNapoli, the accountant appointed by a Federal judge to liquidate the assets of John McNamara, the Long Island developer and auto dealer accused of defrauding General Motors of $436 million. """"We're not looking for any bottom fish to come along and make low-ball offers,"""" Mr. DiNapoli said today as he juggled a previously scheduled appointment in Manhattan and his new role as day-to-day manager of the McNamara assets. """"We plan to do what's in the best interest of the creditors. And if that means continuing to manage and wait, then that's the path I'll take."""" On Tuesday, Federal prosecutors announced that Mr. McNamara had agreed to turn over to the Federal Government $400 million in assets, which represents one of the largest forfeitures of business holdings ever approved by a civil court. And Judge Edward R. Korman of Federal District Court in Brooklyn appointed Mr. DiNapoli, a 37-year-old partner in the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, to oversee those assets, manage them and sell them to satisfy Mr. McNamara's nervous creditors."
5/20/1992	G.M. Adds More Stock To Offering	The General Motors Corporation got more takers than it expected for its stock offering yesterday, enabling the nation's largest industrial company to sell 55 million shares, or 5 million more than it had planned. And the final price, $39 a share, was only 25 cents below G.M.'s closing price yesterday of $39.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The offering price reflects confidence among investors, because demand at nearly the current market price exceeded the planned supply of shares.
5/20/1992	Port Jefferson Auto Dealer Forfeits Most of His Assets	In one of the largest forfeitures of business assets ever approved by a civil court, John McNamara, the Long Island auto dealer and developer accused of defrauding General Motors of $436 million, has agreed to turn over close to $400 million in assets to the Federal Government. Under the agreement, a court-appointed trustee will manage Mr. McNamara's businesses and oversee the liquidation of his assets to satisfy his creditors.
5/19/1992	Wall St. Gets That G.M. Feeling	For General Motors, yesterday wound up the sales pitch of a lifetime. Its short video presentation, which it displayed around the country, was a smooth one. Fresh-faced adolescents and bare-bottomed babies grinned from the seats of G.M. cars. Happy customers breezed by in their Cadillacs and Chevrolets. But this time the world's largest auto maker was not selling cars and trucks, it was selling itself, in the form of the largest stock offering by an American company. Later this week, G.M. plans to sell up to 57.5 million new shares of its common stock to raise $2.29 billion. The money will dress up G.M.'s battered balance sheet and pay for everything from new-car development to new tools and equipment.

5/2/1992	G.M. Dealer's Many Ties to L.I. Officials	It was an environmentalist's nightmare: a plan to turn a wild pine woods and rolling meadow at the edge of a state forest preserve into 550 condominiums, threatening to snarl traffic, crowd schools and change the character of a neighborhood on Long Island Sound. The plan would more than triple the number of housing units that the developer, John M. McNamara -- a car dealer, philanthropist and Republican stalwart -- was permitted to build on the site, and in July 1988, more than 500 angry, protesting residents filled an auditorium where the Brookhaven town board was meeting on the proposal.
4/29/1992	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the first-quarter earnings of the non-automotive subsidiaries of the General Motors Corporation misstated the percentage decline in profit at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. It was 44 percent, not 80 percent.
4/29/1992	G.M. Posts First Profit Since 1990	The General Motors Corporation today announced its first quarterly profit since the second quarter of 1990. The company, which has been scrambling to reorganize its management and operations to help erase its string of losses, said it made $179 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $1.1 billion, excluding nonrecurring gains, a year earlier.
4/28/1992	Two G.M. Units Show Strong Profits	Two of General Motors' three non-automotive subsidiaries -- the Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Electronics -- posted solid quarterly profit gains today. The third, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, said profits were actually stronger although it recorded an 80 percent drop from last year's first-quarter profit, which was restated because of an accounting change. G.M. is scheduled to announce overall first-quarter financial results on Tuesday.
4/25/1992	General Motors Shifts Operations And Plans a Huge Stock Offering	The General Motors Corporation, moving swiftly after a management shake-up, announced yesterday that it would attempt the largest stock offering in American history and took another step in reorganizing its huge vehicle-making operations. It said the goal was to produce better-quality vehicles faster and at less cost. G.M., the world's largest auto maker, said it would offer up to 57.5 million shares of common stock to investors around the world, worth $2.3 billion at current market prices. It plans to issue another $500 million worth of stock to its pension funds.
4/24/1992	U.S. to Seek Forfeiture Of Assets In G.M. Case	A Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn said yesterday that the Government would move to seize most of the known assets of John McNamara, the Long Island car dealer who is accused of defrauding General Motors of $436 million. The action, which could come within days, would be the first public indication that Mr. McNamara may have funneled at least some of the G.M. money to his real estate and financial holdings, which are estimated to be worth $330 million.
4/24/1992	Car Model in Park Crash Drew Safety Complaints	The 1987 Oldsmobile Delta 88, the type of car that crashed in Washington Square Park yesterday, has had problems with its throttle system that led to a recall of thousands of the cars in 1988. From 1987 to 1989, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducted an investigation of complaints about sudden acceleration in the 1987 Oldsmobile Delta 88. General Motors, the manufacturer of the car, notified the agency that it was recalling 22,000 Delta 88's and Pontiac Bonnevilles.
4/24/1992	Blissful Day in the Park Becomes a Nightmare	It was finally the first sweet day of spring, and for city dwellers the only place to greet its tardy arrival was at the park. As the temperature nudged into the high 70's yesterday and a refreshing breeze wafted over the city, Washington Square Park, never a quiet place, teemed with humanity. Everyone seemed to be out. Neighboring New York University was staging its annual clean-up day in the park, planting flowers and painting benches and railings. The project was supposed to have been on Tuesday, but was rained out. By early afternoon, Wet Paint stickers were taped to many of the dark green benches and low-slung black railings, and the park just sparkled.
4/20/1992	Finding Profits in Peace at Hughes	Just a few years ago the Soviet Union was still the Evil Empire, Pentagon spending was rising and Harry King was working on a military program at the Hughes Aircraft Company's radar division. Today the Soviet Union is no more, the future of military contracting is bleak and Mr. King is developing power systems at Hughes for electric cars being designed by the company's parent, the General Motors Corporation.
4/19/1992	G.M. Official Testified in Suspect's Extortion Trial	John M. McNamara, the Long Island car dealer who last week was accused of defrauding General Motors of $436 million in a scheme that lasted more than a decade, was indicted in 1973 on a Federal extortion charge involving the construction of his dealership. The 1973 charges against Mr. McNamara, one of six defendants, were eventually dropped and his father's conviction in the case was overturned on appeal. But records of the 1973 case raise new questions about General Motors' vigilance over Mr. McNamara.
4/18/1992	Car Dealer's Fraud Case Puzzles Industry Officials	Auto industry officials have expressed incredulity that John McNamara, the Long Island auto dealer charged with fraud, could have convinced a subsidiary of General Motors to finance tens of thousands of nonexistent vehicles, as Federal prosecutors have maintained he did. According to the charges, Mr. McNamara borrowed $425 million supposedly to buy 17,000 converted vans from Kay Industries of Indianapolis in December, then sell them to the Cydonia Trading Company in Cyprus.
4/16/1992	Prosecutors Depict Vast Fraud Scheme By L.I. Car Dealer	"A Long Island car dealer borrowed $1.75 billion from General Motors last year to finance tens of thousands of cars that did not exist, Federal prosecutors said yesterday. They charged the dealer with fraud in what one prosecutor called """"the mother of all kiting schemes."""" In a civil suit two weeks ago, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation accused the dealer, John McNamara, of defrauding the company of more than $400 million. But the staggering scope of the accusations became clearer yesterday when Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged Mr. McNamara with mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering."
4/14/1992	Top G.M. Executives Took Pay Cut in '91	Officers and top executives of the General Motors Corporation suffered a 36 percent pay cut in 1991, according to the auto maker's 1991 proxy statement, which was published today. G.M. directors, who replaced G.M.'s president last week and removed Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive, as head of the board's executive committee, also sliced executive pay.
4/12/1992	How G.M.'s Altered Personality Saved Opel	"When the 1980's dawned, Adam Opel A.G. seemed to be speeding along the Autobahn to oblivion. Germany's second-largest auto maker was producing boring, boxy cars that were badly designed and carelessly assembled. Sales were slumping, losses were rising and jokes were prevalent -- for instance, """"Pick up Opel's brochure and you can hear the rattle."""" Behind the scenes, however, Opel was being transformed. Its parent company, the General Motors Corporation, was investing billions of dollars in modernizing Opel's production facilities and developing new models. Quality was steadily upgraded and staid styling was replaced by a sleek, efficient look."
4/12/1992	FORUM; Accelerating G.M.'s Pace of Change	The General Motors board of directors startled Wall Street, the automotive industry and, perhaps most of all, G.M. management last Monday when it demoted the company's president, Lloyd Reuss, and chief financial officer, Robert T. O'Connell, removed Robert Stempel as chairman of the board's executive committee and eliminated two of management's six seats on the board. The broad reasons: G.M. lost $7 billion in North America in 1991, still has high costs because of serious excess capacity and supports expensive rebate programs in a weak market. But it is unclear whether the planned changes can slash G.M.'s costs and restore it to profitability and whether this action signals a new chapter in management-board relations at major corporations.
4/12/1992	Pulling Down the Corporate Clubhouse	"It used to be so easy, so civilized, more a social ritual than a chore. The members of the corporate board would fly in the night before, dine with their old friend, the chief executive, sharing after-dinner brandy and camaraderie. Each director would receive a slender binder of briefing papers that, typically, got a cursory read before the formality of the next morning's board meeting. The chief executive called the tune, and the board hummed along. """"Those days of the corporate club are over,"""" said Gerard Roche, chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, a big executive recruiter. """"There's a lot more tension between the board and the chief executive today, but also a lot more communication. Things are going in a healthy but uncomfortable direction."
4/12/1992	What's Good for General Motors?	"The troubles at General Motors spilled over into the boardroom last week, when the giant automaker's chairman was removed as head of a powerful board committee and its president was demoted. Chairman Robert C. Stempel had announced plans in December to shut down 21 plants and cut 74,000 workers from the payroll. But declaring that """"a more aggressive management approach"""" was needed, the board served notice that the overhaul of the company was not going fast enough. The moves were clearly a reprimand for Mr. Stempel. Not only did he lose his post as head of the board's executive committee, replaced by John G. Smale, a director who is a former chief executive of Procter & Gamble, but the unseated president, Lloyd E. Reuss, had been fulsomely praised earlier this year by Mr. Stempel, saying """"Lloyd's my man."
4/9/1992	G.M. Chairman Is Given Board's 'Full Support'	"The director of the General Motors Corporation who led the board's move to more closely monitor management acted yesterday to play down widespread speculation that the G.M. board planned an expanded role in the daily operations of the company. In his first statement since the board announced a series of executive changes on Monday, John G. Smale, the former chairman of the Proctor & Gamble Company, said yesterday, """"Neither I nor any of the other outside members of the General Motors board of directors intend to involve ourselves in the day-to-day business of G.M."
4/8/1992	Opel's Chief to Head All of G.M. in Europe	The General Motors Corporation today named Louis R. Hughes, the head of its German subsidiary, as president of its European operations. Mr. Hughes, the 43-year-old chairman and managing director of Adam Opel A.G. in Russelsheim, Germany, will immediately become president of General Motors Europe. He was also named one of nine group executives of General Motors.
4/8/1992	Message From G.M.'s Board: Cut Losses Fast	The historic overthrow of General Motors' president leaves Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, in a fight for authority over his company. In the two years since he took office, Mr. Stempel, who is 58 years old, has moved slowly, even deliberately, in paring down the world's largest auto maker to bring it into line with its diminished market share.
4/8/1992	Rubber Stamp Is Tossed Aside By G.M. Board	"The General Motors Corporation -- long known as one of America's most smug and insular companies -- has abandoned its past in placing an outside board member in charge of a top board committee to monitor more closely G.M.'s management. John G. Smale, the 64-year-old former chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company and a marketing man who flattened that company's bureaucracy, led the drive by G.M.'s outside directors to pursue, as the board said, """"more aggressive management"""" in trimming costs, winnowing bureaucracy and possibly closing more plants."
4/7/1992	President Is Demoted At G.M.	The General Motors Corporation demoted its president yesterday and removed its chairman, Robert C. Stempel, from his post as head of a powerful board committee in an unusual display of power by outside directors. Still reeling from the biggest loss in American corporate history, G.M. named John (Jack) F. Smith Jr., 53 years old, as president and chief operating officer. He replaces Lloyd E. Reuss. Mr. Smith had been a vice chairman in charge of international operations.
4/7/1992	A Star in G.M. Effort in Europe	In the mid-1980's, the European operations of General Motors were in such poor shape that the auto maker considered selling or drastically shrinking them. Last year, G.M. had record sales in Europe, and the $1.76 billion it earned there buttressed record losses from its North American automotive business. John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., the new president of G.M., who turned 54 yesterday, is credited with planting many of the seeds for the sharp turnaround in Europe. Auto industry analysts have given him credit for consolidating what had been a segmented and divided enterprise into a pan-European operation in marketing, distribution, cost structure and management.
4/5/1992	In Florida, Testing Road to the Future	IT used to be that automotive technology had to do with . . . well, with cars. Ultimately, if you were a manufacturer, you went with Cadillac's electric starter. Or with Ford's inexpensive V8. Or with Plymouth's hydraulic brakes. These days, though, the innards are pretty much alike. To be sure, some cars lack air bags and antilock brakes, but those things will come, dictated by the marketplace. And so, more and more, the technology has to do not with rods and levers and multiple-valve engines, but with the periphery.
3/29/1992	Not Quite Letter-Perfect	Oldsmobile Division General Motors Corporation 920 Townsend Street Lansing, Mich. 48921 Dear Division:
3/17/1992	Why Hasn't G.M. Switched Even One Agency Since '58?	THE auto makers are perhaps the best illustration of advertisers' tendency to dismiss their agencies more frequently during a recession. Since last summer, Isuzu, Mercedes-Benz and Subaru have changed shops, while Jaguar's account has gone into review. One car maker that is certainly troubled is the largest, General Motors, which plans to close 21 plants and eliminate 74,000 jobs by 1995. Yet, the last time G.M. dismissed one of its national agencies, Dwight D. Eisenhower was President: In 1958, G.M. switched its Buick division from the Kudner agency to McCann-Erickson, where it has remained.
3/16/1992	A Top G.M. Official Is Reported Chosen To Succeed Iacocca	Yielding to the wishes of Lee A. Iacocca, the directors of the Chrysler Corporation have agreed to name a General Motors executive to succeed him as chief executive, several people with knowledge of the board's deliberations said tonight. After two days of meetings in New York, the board's 10 outside directors settled on Mr. Iacocca's candidate, Robert J. Eaton, who currently heads G.M.'s highly profitable European operations.
3/16/1992	Impressive Record at G.M. Europe	Robert J. Eaton has been negotiating with the Chrysler Corporation from a position of strength. His work in Europe, where he was handed the General Motors Corporation's leadership torch four years ago to carry on a revival-in-progress, gave G.M. a significant lift at a time when it desperately needed help. G.M. had the worst financial year in its history last year, but the results would have been more dismal if not for G.M. Europe's record sales of 1.6 million vehicles, contributing $1.79 billion in earnings. The big G.M. operation was the most profitable of the European auto makers last year, when G.M. as a whole posted a loss of $4.5 billion.
3/14/1992	Chairman of Opel Unit Is Promoted by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation announced yesterday that Louis R. Hughes, chairman and managing director of its Adam Opel A.G. subsidiary in Europe, had been named one of 35 corporate vice presidents. G.M. said in a statement that the auto maker was rewarding Mr. Hughes, 43 years old, for the success of the Opel organization. Opel's sales in Europe rose 26 percent in 1991 from 1990, to 719,000 vehicles, a gain attributed in part to the unification of East and West Germany. Strong sales in Europe helped the car company offset record losses in the United States last year.
3/13/1992	THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters; Hurt and Angry Car Workers Say Brown Speaks for Them	Day by day, week by week, the turn of events eats away at the working men and women of this blue-collar city. They're losing their livelihood, the giant General Motors plant here. They've already lost half their jobs at the two neighboring Ford plants. Now they've even lost their Presidential candidate, with the withdrawal this week of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
3/12/1992	Iacocca Heir? A New Name Is Dropped	The long-running drama over who will succeed Lee A. Iacocca at the Chrysler Corporation took a fresh turn today. A top General Motors executive acknowledged that he had twice discussed with Mr. Iacocca the possibility of joining Chrysler as a senior executive, a move that would presumably put him in the running to become chief executive when Mr. Iacocca retires. Although the G.M. executive, Robert J. Eaton, said today that he had not yet received a firm offer, another automotive executive with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said an offer might come within a week. In a telephone interview from his office in Zurich, Mr. Eaton, a longtime engineering executive who is currently president of G.M.'s European operations, declined to provide specific details about the talks.
3/8/1992	Business Incentives: A High-Priced Letdown	The stunning decision by the General Motors Corporation to close its 91-year-old assembly plant here, coming after 15 years of huge subsidies aimed at keeping big business in the region, has provoked bitter criticism over the taxpayer support of corporations and which, if any, industries should qualify. G.M. announced Feb. 24 that it would shutter the North Tarrytown plant in 1995, eliminating 3,400 jobs in a region where manufacturing, once dominant, has been in harrowing decline.
3/8/1992	A Task Force Begins Its Struggle With G.M.	"ON a winter morning in 1987, a proud Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, along with James McDonald, who was president of General Motors at the time, announced what was hailed then as a """"historic private-public sector agreement"""" to bring a major automobile manufacturing project to North Tarrytown and to preserve """"at least 4,000 jobs for at least 10 years."""" What Governor Cuomo was so pleased about that Tuesday in February five years ago was that in addition to saving the plant's jobs """"we are all but guaranteeing these jobs for the rest of this century, jobs for the workers of today and perhaps for their sons and daughters as well,"""" he said."
3/4/1992	Reprieve Sought for Doomed Tarrytown Plant	"One week after the General Motors Corporation announced a plan to close its assembly plant here, New York State today announced a counteroffensive, pledging to do all it could to change the auto maker's mind. In Albany, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said he had appointed government, business and labor officials to a task force to explore financial incentives and other inducements to keep G.M. in Westchester County. The task force, he said, would also examine new ways G.M. could use the plant as well as identify """"new uses and users"""" should G.M. refuse to reconsider."
3/3/1992	Hughes Sells G.M. Shares	The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has sold 10 million shares of the General Motors Corporation class H stock back to the company for $30 a share. The transaction lowers the institute's stake to 47.3 percent, from 61.3 percent, of the class H stock outstanding, according to a Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
3/1/1992	Late Praise for Model Plant	"THE day after General Motors announced that it would close its assembly plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., a Washington think tank released a report calling the plant a model of successful cooperation between management and labor. """"One of the key factors in the success of the Tarrytown program was that labor and management were able to establish mutual trust where before it had never existed,"""" said the report issued Tuesday by the private Employment Policy Foundation. """"Because the cooperative effort was agreed to voluntarily, both sides became convinced of the other's sincerity and commitment."
3/1/1992	Cadillac's All-American Contender	"MY wife came home the other day with a very good question from a co-worker. With all that's going on, he had asked her to ask me, what exactly is an American car? Ah, interesting puzzle that. And I have to say that it gave me pause. Today, almost every automobile is an amalgam of parts from all over. """"Japanese"""" cars are built hither and yon. A lot of """"Detroit"""" cars are made in Canada. Some are from Mexico. And almost all of them have tires from Europe or transmissions from France or odometers from Timbuktu. But then it struck me."
3/1/1992	Economists Assess Loss of G.M. Jobs	THE current rate of local unemployment will probably exceed 6 percent shortly, and newly released reports cite a loss of 10,400 jobs in the county over the last year. Westchester not only continues to feel the current effects of the recession, economists and labor analysts say, but is expected to feel the pain for many months to come. With the announcement last week that General Motors, the county's third-largest employer, will close its North Tarrytown assembly plant in the summer of 1995, analysts projected tough times ahead for 2,500 auto workers who live in Westchester and whose skills may be too specialized to be easily transferable. Only International Business Machines and Nynex employ more workers locally than the automaker.
2/27/1992	Detroit Leaning on Japan, in Both Senses	"When Lee A. Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, demands that America take a stand against Japanese car imports surely he must not be talking about car No. 11AMRXML2D19W-C06, which rolled off the line here the other day. The car was produced by teams of Japanese workers all wearing neat uniforms with """"Mitsubishi Motors"""" emblazoned on the back. But the sporty. bright red model is a Dodge Stealth, made by Mitsubishi, and sold in America starting at about $17,000. And the only thing that makes it seem American is the word """"Dodge"""" etched in the front bumper. Mr. Iacocca made no mention of Mitsubishi's Nagoya plant when he visited Japan with President Bush in January, and these days people at the plant say as little as possible about Mr. Iacocca. Confused Feelings """"We feel a little funny about him,"""" Kozo Naruse, the deputy general manager, conceded the other day, shaking his head. """"Here he is talking about keeping Japanese cars out of America, and every day we come to work and make very good Chryslers."
2/27/1992	End of Plant Predictable, But Closing Still Hurts	Two days after General Motors shocked Westchester County with news that it would close its huge plant here in 1995, the fallout seems certain to be painful, but limited, across a suburban landscape where welding metal, stamping plastic and other manufacturing has long been a relic of the industrial past. In this Hudson River village, 18 miles north of Manhattan, as elsewhere in New York State, a chorus of angry charges is being directed at General Motors, which received rich subsidies in the mid-1980's to keep the plant open.
2/26/1992	EMPLOYEE LAYOFFS IN NEW YORK AREA DISRUPT ECONOMIES	With companies from General Motors to United Technologies announcing plans to shrink their work forces, the New York City region faces the prospect of at least 40,000 employees losing their jobs during the next few years, primarily in manufacturing, transportation and government. And those are just the layoffs that have been publicly announced. Coming on the heels of the more than 500,000 jobs lost in the region since employment peaked in February 1989, this latest round of announcements is certainly not good news. Even before this, the total exceeded the 350,000 jobs lost in the region from late 1973 through 1976, when the area was suffering its worst recession since the 1930's. Heightened Concern But there is a new and, in many ways, more disruptive element to the latest round of layoff announcements. Companies are revealing that thousands of people will be laid off but are providing scant details as to when, where or who will be affected. That is creating heightened uncertainty, and causing even those whose jobs are not threatened to cut back their spending.
2/26/1992	Flint Journal; A City Where Hope Runs on Empty	"In its glory days, not so very long ago, when jobs seemed almost as plentiful as autumn leaves, this town proudly called itself """"Vehicle City,"""" because of all the cars and trucks its workers produced for the General Motors Corporation. But the American Dream has been fading into bitter memory here for years now as job after job has been lost to layoffs and plant closings. Vehicle City is running out of gas."
2/25/1992	The G.M. Cutbacks; A Surprise Cuts Deep in Westchester	The announcement today that General Motors will close its huge assembly plant here sent waves of surprise and anguish across Westchester County, where auto workers and Government officials had expected the plant to survive a spate of closings by the world's largest auto maker. G.M. said the North Tarrytown plant, which has been producing cars since 1900 at a factory that sprawls along the Hudson River shore, would close permanently in the summer of 1995, eliminating nearly 3,500 jobs and one of the few major manufacturing operations that were spared during the steep industrial decline in the New York City region during the 1970's and 1980's.
2/25/1992	The G.M. Cutbacks; Michigan Workers See Politics in Closing	Workers at General Motors' Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti Township, Mich., today disputed the assertion by the company that its decision to shut their plant in 1993 was made solely on economic grounds. Officials of Local 1776 of the United Automobile Workers, which represents workers at Willow Run, said their plant had several economic advantages over its sister plant in Arlington, Tex., which will remain open and will be refurbished to handle increased output of large rear-wheel-drive cars.
2/25/1992	The G.M. Cutbacks; Auto Maker Posts Deficit Of $2.5 Billion	Closing the books on its worst year in history, the General Motors Corporation today reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.5 billion, a record quarterly loss for the company. The deficit reflected a one-time pretax charge to income of $2.8 billion to close 21 plants over the next several years. Excluding all extraordinary charges, the auto maker's loss for the fourth quarter was $519.8 million, on revenues of $33.6 billion. That represents a significant improvement from the fourth quarter of 1990, when G.M. posted a $1.62 billion loss on revenues of $29.9 billion after war in the Persian Gulf shattered consumer confidence and dried up auto sales.
2/23/1992	The Mood As G.M. Plant Starts Up Again	RETURNING to his job last week at the General Motors plant on Beekman Avenue here, Pat Martelli was in an optimistic mood. The 2.5-million-square-foot assembly plant where he has worked for more than 13 years had just reopened after a two-week shutdown, the second since the middle of December. Although another furlough is scheduled for early March, Mr. Martelli said he believed the worst of the recession and hard times for the automaker were over and that he and his fellow workers need not fear for their jobs.
2/23/1992	It's Flash, It's Dash and It's Out of Detroit	"Detroit is once again turning heads with its car designs the striking forms of the Cadillac Seville, Buick Skylark and Chrysler's new family of mid-size sedans. The change has energized the Big Three's studios, where designers still wince at the memory of a 1983 Fortune magazine cover showing four General Motors models, one indistinguishable from the next. That image sent home the point -- """"signed, sealed and delivered,"""" as one designer put it: car styling, a traditional American strength, had become a weakness. In recent years, even while battling the incursions of foreign car makers and retooling to meet ever-stricter Federal standards, they have kept a wistful eye on design. And in recent months, they have rolled out the fruits of their new visions, designed to distance themselves from the drab decades, to return to the days when the whole car -- not just the vanity plate -- made the statement of who you are. It's hardly a return to the be chromed land yachts of the 1950's, but it is a world of """"cab forward"""" design, cat-eye headlights and even plastic cladding around the bottom, an upscale image borrowed from Europe that lends a racy line (as well as protecting the paint job from road debris)."
2/14/1992	Vehicle Sales Post Sharp Rise	"Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose a robust 23.8 percent in early February, auto makers reported today. Although analysts had expected a gain over the sluggish period a year earlier, they said sales for the first 10 days of the month were the strongest sign of improvement in the auto industry since last summer. """"We're off the bottom, and there seems to be genuine improvement in retail demand,"""" said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with Furman Selz in New York."
2/12/1992	Bush Orders End to Ozone Destroyers by 1996	In response to new evidence that the earth's atmospheric ozone shield may be weakening over parts of the United States, President Bush today ordered directed American manufacturers to end by Dec. 31, 1995, virtually all production of chemicals that destroy ozone. The policy, authorized under a provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act, takes effect immediately. Last Friday the Bush Administration reversed its opposition to such a plan and backed a Senate proposal to phase out the production of the chemicals as soon as possible, rather than by 2000.
2/12/1992	Japanese May Raise Auto Prices	"Some Japanese auto makers said today that they were considering raising their prices in the United States. Such a move could prove costly to consumers, but analysts said it could provide an opportunity for the Big Three to win back market share and perhaps relieve some trade tensions. Executives of the American sales arm of the Toyota Motor Corporation said they were considering a price increase """"due to the continued appreciation of the Japanese yen, which has risen 9 percent since last summer."""" A stronger yen erodes the value of profits made in dollars. Toyota has already raised the base price of its redesigned 1992 Camry sedan by almost 18 percent from the 1991 level, to $14,368."
2/11/1992	Detroit Slows Minority Plan	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company have slowed their minority dealer training programs until they can find dealerships for already qualified candidates, the auto makers said today. Ford has about 200 black dealerships, down from 277 in 1989, a company spokesman, Thomas Rhoades, said.
2/11/1992	G.M. to Subsidize Buy-American Bid	The General Motors Corporation said that for the next 90 days or so it would match or supplement any cash incentives offered by its 30,000 supplier companies to their employees toward the purchase of a new G.M. vehicle. G.M. is the first American auto maker to establish such a program, which is intended to improve sagging sales by directly aiming at an audience of millions of potential consumers who work outside the corporation but are very dependent on its fortunes.
2/9/1992	Layoffs Called No Big Threat To a Recovery	Although many of the country's biggest companies have announced plans to cut staggering numbers of employees, economists say the layoffs alone do not add up to a threat that could demolish the chances for an economic recovery this year. What most people forget, the economists say, is that the sheer size of the overall United States labor market dwarfs even sweeping cuts planned by the I.B.M.'s, G.M.'s and Lockheeds. No matter how devastating plant cutbacks and mass layoffs are for the communities and individuals directly affected, new research shows that surprisingly large job losses amount to business-as-usual for the flexible American economy even in the best of times. Danger Is Psychological The gravest danger the corporate cutbacks pose is psychological. Layoff headlines could frighten those with jobs into thinking that they might be next and cause them to stop spending, a statistic measured as consumer confidence. Policy makers from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, on down have consistently underestimated the power of low consumer confidence in the last two years. Collapsing confidence helped knock a sluggish economy into recession a year and a half ago, and another panic attack, prompted by the layoff surge, strangled the fledgling recovery last fall.
2/8/1992	G.M. Has Begun to Plan Staff Revamping	Robert C. Stempel, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, acknowledged today that the nation's leading auto company was in the midst of planning an extensive reorganization of its white-collar work force in North America. Mr. Stempel declined to elaborate, but several G.M. executives attending the annual Chicago Auto Show said they thought details of the changes would be announced by midyear. Mr. Stempel's acknowledgment was prompted by speculation raised by articles in The Detroit Free Press and The Wall Street Journal.
2/2/1992	Cars That Whirrr And Burn Rubber	"Say """"electric"""" and the car that comes to mind is smooth-riding, quiet and almost antiseptically clean. It's not exactly the model muscle car. But muscle is how the General Motors Corporation is positioning the Impact, the two-seater that it plans to bring to market in the mid-90's. To meet California requirements that 2 percent of each car company's sales in the state be """"zero emission vehicles"""" by 1998 -- a requirement that only battery-powered cars can now meet -- G.M. has focused on a sales virtue that it thinks will give it perhaps the best chance of reaching such a high penetration: performance."
1/30/1992	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Anti-Japan Auto Ads May Backfire	"A RENEWED wave of harsh attacks on Japanese cars and trucks is inundating television and newspapers, as sort of the evil twin of the automotive industry's """"Buy American"""" advertising. Many of these new passionate, possibly xenophobic pitches seem the automotive equivalent of negative political advertising. Instead of Willie Horton's mug shot, however, the villain is depicted by rising suns, backed by sour-sounding string music meant to mimic the tones of the Japanese koto. And lest these be too subtle, there are remonstrations to remember Pearl Harbor."
1/30/1992	Software Case Countersuit	"Computer Associates International Inc. said today that it had filed a lawsuit against the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, seeking $2 billion in damages for software fraud. The claim filed in Federal District Court here was a countersuit to a lawsuit filed by Electronic Data against Computer Associates earlier this month. Electronic Data dismissed the new suit as """"frivolous."
1/28/1992	G.M. to Close High-Tech Parts Factory	"General Motors' """"factory of the future"""" will become part of the auto maker's past in August, when it plans to close the Saginaw, Mich., plant. The General Motors Corporation said the factory, called Saginaw Vanguard, had fulfilled its goals of developing high-tech solutions to productivity problems. The project was started in 1982, as part of the campaign by G.M.'s former chairman, Roger B. Smith, to increase productivity through automation."
1/28/1992	G.M. Plans Issue Of Class C Stock	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had filed for $750 million of a new class C preference stock to be sold here and abroad to help strengthen its balance sheet. The portion to be sold in the United States will be handled by a group headed by Merrill Lynch & Company and involves 12 million depository shares to be offered at $50 a share. The international part of the offering will be three million shares offered through a group headed by Merrill Lynch International Ltd., at a similar price.
1/28/1992	U.S.-Japan Auto Parts Rift Grows	"In tones reflecting the increasingly combative exchanges between Japan and the United States, the head of a Japanese auto group said today that it was """"incomprehensible"""" that Detroit had not accepted Tokyo's offer to buy $19 billion more in American-made auto parts. He said top Japanese executives """"have no intention"""" of discussing the issue again with the Big Three. The comments by Yutaka Kume, the president of Nissan Motor Company and the chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, virtually erased any hopes of continuing discussions among the world's biggest auto makers about how to close the trade gap between the countries."
1/24/1992	Sales of American Vehicles Dropped 1.9% in Mid-January	"Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America declined 1.9 percent in mid-January, auto makers reported today. Industry analysts said the figures suggest that the market is neither improving nor worsening. """"It's a continuation of the malaise,"""" said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in Manhattan. """"We're probably going to bump along the bottom of this trough another six to eight weeks."""" Consumers 'Overly Cautious'"
1/24/1992	The New Buy-American Auto Sweepstakes	Maybe it was President Bush's mixed success in Japan, or the Japanese official who said that American auto workers were lazy and illiterate. Maybe it is the deep slump in Detroit. But all of a sudden, companies around the United States are saying it would be good for America to be good to G.M., and they are offering inducements to their employees to buy from General Motors, Chrysler or Ford. Some, groping to define just what constitutes an American car, are authorizing employees to buy autos made at the Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio, or Nissan's factory in Smyrna, Tenn. But other companies have ruled out cars carrying American nameplates if they are manufactured in Canada or Japan.
1/23/1992	Cut at G.M. Plant	The General Motors Corporation will eliminate the second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant at the end of February, putting 1,000 workers at the plant on indefinite layoff. The car maker, moving to slash production because of the recession, said Tuesday that the decision to cut production at Fairfax by about a third was not related to the company's announcement last month of a sweeping retrenchment.
1/21/1992	G.M.'s Gone, but This City's Alive	On Nov. 6, 1986, General Motors delivered a body blow to this city of 24,000. To cut costs, the auto maker said it would close its 64-year-old plant here that assembled Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds. Residents feared that G.M.'s departure would mean the end to life as Norwood had known it for generations. G.M.'s taxes afforded this small city its independence from neighboring Cincinnati and spawned a wealth of services, including free paramedic services, and generous budgets that had allowed the city to buy a $750,000 incinerator and a $110,000 fire truck, both for cash.
1/17/1992	G.M. Negotiating Sale Of Daewoo Unit Stake	"The General Motors Corporation said today that it was negotiating the sale of its 50 percent stake in the Daewoo Motor Company of South Korea to its partner, the Daewoo Group. The sale would be subject to """"an acceptable price and other terms,"""" said a G.M. spokesman, John Pakarek. G.M. intends to continue to do business in South Korea by supplying Daewoo with parts, he said."
1/16/1992	G.M. Sets Venture in China To Assemble Pickup Trucks	The General Motors Overseas Corporation announced today that it had formed a $100 million joint venture with a Chinese vehicle manufacturer to assemble pickup trucks for sale in China. The joint venture represents General Motors' effort to enter a vehicle market that is expected to be one of the fastest growing in the world. China's 1.1 billion people now get around mostly on bicycles, but very rapid industrial growth rates are likely to mean enormous growth in the numbers of cars, buses and trucks on the roads in the future.
1/14/1992	G.M. Announces Recall To Repair V6 Engines	The General Motors Corporation confirmed today that it was recalling about 1.5 million cars to repair defective V6 engines. The announcement comes at an awkward time for G.M. as it tries to win back American customers by saying that the quality of its cars matches that of Japanese autos.
1/12/1992	On the Road With Oldsmobile's Tourer	"I REMEMBER, once, trying to rent a summer place in Nantasket, Mass. This was in the mid-60's, and the prospective landlord was a nasty guy. But I wanted the place, and my family was counting on me, no matter that this grouch thought us too inferior to spend a week in his rental house. He didn't like my name. Didn't like that I had two little kids. But, most of all, I remember that in the middle of my stammering interview, he asked imperiously what kind of car I drove """"over the road."""" It was a test."
1/12/1992	A Crusade to Save the Soul of Arlington	A master at civic boosterism, Tom Vandergriff lured the Senators baseball team, now the Texas Rangers, away from Washington in 1971 and coaxed millions of dollars from voters for a stadium, a convention center, libraries, schools, lakes and roads. But no triumph during his 26 years as Mayor here, until 1977, compares with the surprise choice by the General Motors Corporation 41 years ago to pass up Dallas and Fort Worth to build an assembly plant in Arlington, then a small farm town of 7,800 people and four square miles.
1/10/1992	A Trade Mission Ends in Tension As the 'Big Eight' of Autos Meet	"President Bush's hopes of returning home with what he called an """"action plan"""" to help Detroit began to unwind late this afternoon, in one of the most unlikely business meetings in the history of Japanese-American industrial rivalries. The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers -- three American, five Japanese -- gathered face to face in a hotel room in downtown Tokyo, with everyone in the room clearly understanding, and no one saying, that the American industry will probably never gain back the ground it has lost to Japanese imports and to Japanese cars made in American plants. A Tense Hour It was apparently the first time executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met directly with their counterparts at Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, which together now control more than a third of the American auto market. After a tense hour, during which the Japanese told their guests that American industry needed to transform itself radically, and the Americans warned that the time was long past when """"mere declarations of intent"""" to open markets would suffice, Lee A. Iacocca, the fiery head of the ailing Chrysler Corporation, finally spoke up."
1/9/1992	Chill Persists Between U.S. Car Makers and Japan	As trade negotiators argued all day and then froze for a moment after President Bush's collapse, the heads of America's three largest auto makers came face to face for the first time Wednesday with the commitment from Japan for the giant $8.4 billion superconducting supercollider in Texas, raising neand the Japanese agree on virtually nothing -- certainly not on how the American auto industry was driven to the brink, or on whose responsibility it is to fix it. As the auto executives simmered, however, negotiators for the United States and Japanese Governments appeared close to an agreement on Japanese purchases of American-made autos and auto parts. While the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced at midday today that a basic agreement had been reached, American officials were not yet confirming that. There was still considerable contention over the wording of the final agreement, and many key details have not yet been disclosed. Unimpressed Executives The auto executives who accompanied Mr. Bush have been unimpressed by a blitz of concessions and new import-purchase plans announced in recent days and they spent much of Wednesday warning the Japanese that failing to lower the trade deficit quickly would bring a hail of protectionist legislation from Congress.
1/7/1992	Don't Brake for Detroit	"When President Bush arrives in Japan today with an entourage of frustrated American businessmen, he will demand that Japan buy more American autos -- and pressure the Japanese Government to further restrict Japanese auto sales in the U.S. For the Americans, the $30 billion U.S.-Japan auto trade deficit is a result of Japanese unfairness rather than superior competitiveness. In June, Robert Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, asserted that """"in virtually all cases [U.S. auto parts] have been shown to be just as good as"""" Japanese auto parts."
1/7/1992	Cadillac, Aiming at Luxury Imports, Shows New Engine	Cadillac took the wraps off a powerful new multivalve engine, the Northstar, today. The engine is intended to make the G.M. division more competitive with German and Japanese luxury car makers. Japanese auto makers owe part of their success in the United States to multivalve engine technology, which develops more horsepower from smaller, lighter engines that operate at higher speeds and are often quieter than conventional engines. Luxury car buyers increasingly demand the quiet, smooth power delivered by Lexus, Infiniti and Mercedes models.
12/30/1991	G.M. to Show a High-Mileage Experimental Car	The latest experimental vehicle from the General Motors Corporation, a high-mileage four-passenger car with a body made of carbon fiber, promises to enliven the debate over fuel-efficiency legislation. At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit next week, G.M. will show its Ultralite, which the company says can produce 100-mile-a-gallon fuel efficiency at 50-mile-an-hour highway speeds.
12/30/1991	Robert C. Stempel: Drastic Steps To Cut Losses	Robert C. Stempel, 58, was named chairman of the General Motors Corporation less than two years ago. Since then, the domestic vehicle market has gone almost straight downhill: first came the Persian Gulf war, then a prolonged softness in consumer confidence. Mr. Stempel took a $3.3 billion pretax write-off of plants and personnel last year; last week he announced another wave of shutdowns, totaling 21 plants and 74,000 workers through 1995. He said the effect on G.M.'s balance sheet would not be as high as $3.3 billion.
12/29/1991	Making a Differnce; Playing Rough With G.M.	STEPHEN P. YOKICH is a man on the spot. Vice president of the United Auto Workers in charge of relations with the General Motors Corporation, he must decide whether to negotiate changes in the union's contract with a struggling G.M. or sit things out. For the moment, Mr. Yokich seems unwilling to help G.M. cut costs in the wake of its Dec. 18 announcement of a three-year plan to close 21 plants and eliminate about 50,000 union jobs. Indeed, he fired off an angry response, blaming management for caving in to Wall Street. And he specifically said in an interview Friday that he is abiding by the contract and expects G.M. to do the same.
12/29/1991	Managing; Stempel Walks the Tightrope	"IN Robert C. Stempel, the General Motors Corporation has a chief executive with more respect among factory workers than any other commander of the auto giant in modern times. """"He's a people person, not one of those financial guys,"""" said Annette Morrow, a 15-year veteran at G.M.'s Arlington, Tex., plant."
12/27/1991	2 Cut Ratings on G.M. Debt	Two rating agencies lowered their grades yesterday on debt issued by the General Motors Corporation and its finance unit, citing their doubts about how readily the cutbacks by the company would reverse its fortunes. The expectation of lower ratings has raised the interest rates the company must pay for financing. But the ratings remain investment grade, and keep the General Motors Acceptance Corporation's commercial paper from falling into a lower tier that is more difficult to market.
12/26/1991	RETAILERS REPORT SALES FELL SHORT OF DIM FORECASTS	Retailers would probably like to forget Christmas 1991. While most merchants had been prepared for a sluggish season, many said sales turned out to be even worse than expected. Even the last-minute shopping frenzy was not enough to give merchants anything to cheer about. As recently as a month ago, many retailers had hoped to exceed last year's sales by 5 percent. But results through the close of business on Monday indicate that spending will be flat or up slightly in December. The major retail chains are scheduled to release their final monthly sales results next week.
12/25/1991	G.M. Gave Bonuses Before Making Cuts	The General Motors Corporation acknowledged today that it paid merit bonuses and increased the pay of much of its salaried work force just before it announced widespread job reductions and plant closings last week. John Maciarz, a G.M. spokesman, said the bonuses and raises were awarded to many of the company's 100,000 non-executive salaried workers during the week of Dec. 15.
12/23/1991	Experts Doubt Cutbacks Alone Will Save G.M.	"When the General Motors Corporation announced last week that it was closing 21 plants and shedding 74,000 workers in the next three years, its chairman, Robert C. Stempel, said the changes would enable the world's largest auto maker to """"meet the competitive challenges of the 1990's."""" But many experts are not so sure that G.M. can halt its inexorable decline just by getting smaller."
12/22/1991	Topics of The Times; An Unmerry Christmas From G.M.	There's no gentle way to announce the bad news of corporate retrenchment, but General Motors takes this year's prize for unnecessary roughness. Seven days before Christmas, it told its 400,000 employees that it will close 21 plants -- it didn't say which -- in the next four years. The company says it made the disclosure to head off escalating public speculation about its plans. Others say it was rushing to head off the possibility that its debt securities were about to be downgraded by Wall Street's credit-rating agencies, thus raising the company's borrowing costs.
12/22/1991	Trouble Aside, G.M. Keeps on Truckin'	CAR nuts do nutty things. Just ask. There was me, for example, 30 years ago, down in the gravel with my reel-to-reel Webcor, hunkered with the microphone behind Jake Baer's 2-year-old Chevrolet Corvette.
12/20/1991	Market Place; In Praise of G.M., If Not of Its Stock	MOST automotive analysts agree that the sweeping retrenchment announced by the General Motors Corporation on Wednesday was long overdue, a necessary move to streamline the company's unwieldy operations to match its diminished share of the vehicle market. But the analysts are divided on G.M.'s common stock, which is trading around its four-year low. Some advise selling the stock, out of fear that among other things the dividend may be cut again. Others urge investors to buy G.M. shares, predicting that the stock is unlikely to drop much more.
12/19/1991	21 PLANTS TO SHUT	The General Motors Corporation, which has dominated the world automotive industry for generations, acknowledged today that it would probably never regain the huge share of the market that it enjoyed more than a decade ago. In a wide retrenchment, G.M. said that it would close 21 of its 125 assembly and parts-making plants in North America over the next few years and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs, or nearly 18 percent of its employees in the United States and Canada.
12/19/1991	G.M. Choses Candidates For Factories to Be Closed	The General Motors Corporation, in announcing candidates today for two of the six car or truck plants it plans to close in the next few years, singled out factories that make some of G.M.'s slow-selling larger cars. G.M. will make a final decision on the closings in the coming months. But the company said today that either its Arlington, Tex., plant or its Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., would be shut. Both plants make full-size, rear-wheel-drive cars -- including the Chevrolet Caprice and the Buick Roadmaster -- which are not selling well.
12/19/1991	Tug-of-War Over G.M. Plant Closing	By not announcing which of two big-car assembly plants here and in Ypsilanti, Mich., it would close, the General Motors Corporation today put the lives of 3,400 workers here in limbo. In saying only that the company intends to close in the next few years 21 assembly, engine and parts plants, Robert C. Stempel, chairman and chief executive of the No. 1 auto maker, set off a likely tug-of-war between the company, the union and local politicians as a decision is reached on which plants should be closed.
12/17/1991	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business on Sunday about the General Motors Corporation rendered incorrectly a spokesman's statement about possible changes in top management. The spokesman said no management changes would be announced on Wednesday, when details of a cost-cutting plan are to be released.
12/17/1991	G.M. Woes Add to Pressure on Saturn	Detroit's pronouncements ricochet around Spring Hill, Tenn., like bullets off a tin fence. On the other side of a knoll in the tiny town south of Nashville, the nation's No. 1 auto maker is feeling its way into the future of car manufacturing and trying -- sometimes fitfully, sometimes earnestly -- to shake off the sins of the past. So it is not surprising that an ominous announcement from General Motors' headquarters last Wednesday raised tensions at G.M.'s Saturn factory. As the corporation braces for a major round of plant closings and layoffs at its 32 North American assembly plants, the pressure builds for Saturn to deliver on its promise to efficiently build high-quality cars and to teach G.M. the ways of the future.
12/17/1991	G.M. Cancels Holiday Party	The General Motors Corporation, caught in a swirl of publicity about huge financial losses from its North American operations and the likelihood of layoffs, has abruptly canceled its traditional holiday reception for news reporters. The reception was to have been held on Wednesday at the Detroit Press Club, only hours after a scheduled news conference at which Robert C. Stempel, the chairman of G.M., is expected to announce widespread cutbacks and plant shutdowns to help stem the losses.
12/17/1991	Saturn Stands Out Brightly Amid the Car-Sales Gloom	A retired Navy officer from California recently drove to the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., to let workers know how much he loved his car and offer suggestions for future models. Another buyer liked her new Saturn so much she went to work for a dealership. Though it's early, the Saturn car seems to be attracting an almost cult-like following. Sales, which have been strong, will grow when more cars are available and more dealers are in operation, the company says.
12/16/1991	G.M. in Talks On Rolls-Royce	The General Motors Corporation and Lonrho P.L.C. are in separate talks with Vickers P.L.C. over whether to buy part or all of Rolls-Royce Motors, newspapers here reported over the weekend. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Lonrho had approached Vickers about Rolls-Royce, spurred in part by Lon rho's ownership of Jack Barclay, a Rolls-Royce dealer.
12/15/1991	New G.M. Leadership Flails for Ways to Halt the Car Maker's Slide	"Robert C. Stempel became the General Motors Corporation's 11th chairman in August 1990, amid widespread hope that """"Team Stempel"""" could turn the nation's largest company around. As an engineer, in contrast with the series of accountants who preceded him, Mr. Stempel seemed well positioned to overhaul G.M.'s car and truck models to compete against the Japanese. And his collegial and attentive style was expected to inspire initiative and free expression among the troops, loosening up the authoritarian culture that had prevailed when Roger B. Smith was chairman. But 15 months later, there is little evidence that his leadership has unraveled G.M.'s most confounding predicaments. The company's customer base in North America has failed to grow from depressed levels despite huge investments in new models, losses have mounted, and credit analysts have threatened to downgrade its debt rating -- a prospect that could severely undermine its ability to finance purchases by buyers and dealers."
12/12/1991	G.M. Hints Deep Cuts Are Ahead	Leading the latest round of corporate shrinkage, the General Motors Corporation signaled investors and employees today that deep cutbacks were in the works. Also today, Xerox and TRW announced that they would make substantial trims. [ Page D3. ]
12/6/1991	Oldsmobile Cutting Rate On Leases	Oldsmobile offered unusually inexpensive-lease terms today for its new Achieva compact, which arrives in showrooms this month. The struggling General Motors division is hoping that the new model will win back market share from Japanese competitors like the Honda Accord.
12/4/1991	G.M. to Recall 830,000 Cars to Replace Seat Belts	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would recall all the 830,000 compact Chevrolet Corsicas and Berettas built from 1988 to 1990 to replace seat-belt parts that could break, preventing the driver's or front passenger's shoulder harness from retracting in an accident. John Dinan, a G.M. spokesman, said an investigation by the company had uncovered two defective parts, one of which resulted in the failure of a shoulder harness to retract; in that instance a harness failed to restrain a front-seat passenger involved in an accident.
11/30/1991	No Bonus For Many At G.M.	This holiday season will be a bit leaner than last for tens of thousands of salaried auto workers. The General Motors Corporation, pleading hard times after reporting a $2.2 billion loss for the first nine months of the year, said today that it was canceling a $600 Christmas bonus it had planned to give each salaried worker.
11/19/1991	G.M. Registers Preference Stock	The General Motors Corporation filed a shelf registration on Friday for up to $750 million in preference stock, according to an announcement by the auto maker yesterday.
11/19/1991	A Problem That Cadillac Likes	It would seem like an auto maker's dream: Customers standing in lines for a new car. Cadillac executives have longed to see those lines for years, but now that they have them, such strong demand is a mixed blessing. Car buyers who are getting their first look at the redesigned 1992 Cadillac Seville and Eldorado luxury cars, which went on sale in late September, are as enthusiastic about them as auto writers were in the summer. Despite a wait of up to three months, customers are placing orders -- some without even taking a test drive. The cars -- priced from $32,500 to $38,500 -- are luring import owners, as well as the younger drivers that Cadillac needs to replace its graying customers, who on average are 63 years old. On the Waiting List But the introduction has not been trouble free. The cars, especially the premium models, are in short supply, which Cadillac attributes to the painstakingly slow start-up of its assembly line while the company tries to insure that the cars are perfect. Still, even with the attention to detail, some reports of defects are cropping up from dealers and customers. And some dealers are worried that a long wait will cause customers to give up and buy a different car.
11/14/1991	At Saturn Plant, a Vote on Innovation	"The Saturn Corporation, General Motors' lofty experiment to reinvent labor relations while building a competitive small car, is getting a dose of reality from its union. Nearly 4,700 Saturn workers are expected to approve a new labor contract today -- a """"memorandum of agreement"""" in Saturn's parlance -- that would scale back some of the innovative features of the original accord that linked a portion of pay to profits. The changes would also allow any worker who does not like Saturn's try at a self-directed workplace to opt out with a severance agreement of up to $50,000. It would further permit workers to return to a more conventional pension plan, if they want."
11/13/1991	G.M. Rating Under Review	"Moody's Investors Service said yesterday that it might cut its quality ratings on $75 billion of long-term debt of the General Motors Corporation. Moody's said it would review its ratings because the car maker's """"relatively high operating cost structure will continue to weaken the company's competitive position, despite its aggressive schedule of new model introductions."
11/12/1991	California Advertising For Chevy Is Switched	Chevrolet has moved its advertising account aimed at California consumers from a Los Angeles agency, Vic Olesen & Partners, to the agency that handles all other Chevrolet advertising, Lintas Campbell-Ewald, Warren, Mich. The account is estimated to have billings of $15 million. Confirming a report in this week's issue of the trade publication Adweek, Frank Raine, Chevrolet's director of area marketing, said yesterday that executives of the General Motors division thought it would be more cost-effective to have one agency handle all of their advertising.
11/10/1991	All About/Pickup Trucks; Will Detroit Lose Control of the Reliable Pickup?	Automobiles go through a metamorphosis every new model year. But pickup trucks are a constant. Though options have been added, the basic models have changed very little through the years. Such steadfastness has been good for Detroit. Pickup trucks, which account for about 18 percent of all vehicles sold, are one of the last segments of the market in which the Big Three still hold a substantial edge. Intensely loyal buyers make Ford and Chevrolet's full-size pickups their best-selling vehicles year after year, outselling even their most popular cars. Detroit dominates the compact and intermediate pickup categories as well.
11/9/1991	S.& P. Cuts Ratings on G.M. and Revises Outlook on Ford	"Large and continuing losses at the nation's two largest auto makers prompted the Standard & Poor's Corporation today to lower the ratings on the preference and preferred shares of General Motors and revise its ratings outlook to """"negative"""" from """"stable"""" for the bonds and preference shares of Ford. S.& P. said it had lowered the G.M. ratings by one notch. It also warned that it might reduce the ratings on $90 billion of the company's debt, the ratings of which were last lowered in February. The rating on $110 billion worth of Ford debt was affirmed."
11/9/1991	G.M. Policy: New Engines, Not Repairs	General Motors' new approach to repairing its newest engines is not to fix them at all. Instead, it is paying dealers to remove engines with problems and replace them with new power plants. The unusual program, which started in October, covers seven engines in several models of 1992 cars and small trucks -- 10 percent of G.M.'s engine production in North America. G.M. hopes the program will bolster its image among consumers by reducing complaints about engines that are not fixed properly or promptly. The auto maker also said the returned engines would allow its engineers to analyze problems and make design or assembly changes.
10/28/1991	In Turmoil, Isuzu Looks to G.M.	As if the General Motors Corporation does not have enough troubles these days, its closest partner in the Japanese auto industry, Isuzu Motors Ltd., is running a huge operating loss, appears ready to jettison its president and has reportedly turned to G.M. for financial help. The troubles at Isuzu have been brewing for months. In recent days, as the giant Tokyo Motor Show started and executives from G.M. poured into Tokyo, the industry has been abuzz with talk that Isuzu is in desperate need of a bailout.
10/23/1991	Big Losses For Top 2 In Detroit	The General Motors Corporation posted a $1.1 billion third-quarter loss today and the Ford Motor Company recorded a $574 million loss as the recession-ravaged United States auto industry skidded toward its worst year in history. The Chrysler Corporation is not scheduled to announce third-quarter results until next week, but auto analysts say it, too, will post a sizable loss, which would push total industry losses for the first nine months of the year to about $5 billion. In 1980, its worst year ever, the American auto industry lost $4 billion.
10/22/1991	Withdrawal by Fiat From French Agency	Predictions that the newly merged French agency, Euro RSCG, would be in jeopardy of losing accounts because of perceived client conflicts are beginning to come true: one client, Fiat S.p.A., has withdrawn its $65 million account, and two more have placed their accounts in review. Fiat, the Italian car maker, has reassigned its account to D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, Paris, from its agency of 17 years, MAO, Paris, a unit of Euro RSCG. D.M.B.& B. already handles Fiat accounts in six other European countries. D.M.B.& B.'s announcement of the shift yesterday followed a report about Fiat's decision in this week's issue of Advertising Age.
10/22/1991	Combined Income at 3 G.M. Units Declines 8.6%	The three principal non-automotive subsidiaries of the General Motors Corporation posted an aggregate 8.6 percent drop in earnings today, mostly because of weak results at the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation. G.M.'s General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation and GM Hughes Electronics posted aggregate third-quarter net income of $530 million, down from $580 million a year earlier.
10/20/1991	Why E.D.S. Loves a Recession	"When the Electronic Data Systems Corporation acquired the Enron Corporation's extensive computing staff and equipment in 1989, it essentially guaranteed that it could handle these operations better. It also promised Enron a savings of $200 million over the 10-year life of the contract. The daring pledge underscored E.D.S.'s cocksureness about its ability to squeeze computing costs. But its confidence was well placed. The Houston-based natural gas company thinks it is on its way to saving at least that much, equal to 20 percent of its computing expenses, by 1999. """"We're out of the how-to-do-it part of the computing business,"""" said Jack I. Tompkins, the Enron senior vice president who bargained with E.D.S. on the deal. """"We consider E.D.S. the technology experts."
10/16/1991	Iacocca Urges U.S. Limits on Japanese Car Sales	"Lee A. Iacocca said today that the Big Three auto makers should consider promoting Federal legislation to limit the Japanese car industry to a fixed percentage of the American market. Speaking at the dedication of the Chrysler Corporation's $1 billion technology center outside Detroit, Mr. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said: """"We've never favored a complete restriction, but we'll have to decide our collective position. We have to deal with our own self-interests. At some point, you have to decide what you stand for."
10/15/1991	Potamkin Coming Back To Late-Night TV	After a four-year absence, commercials for the Potamkin Cadillac dealership, once standard fare on late-night television in New York, will begin reappearing later this year. Victor H. Potamkin, who had closed his legendary Manhattan Cadillac dealership in 1987, reopens today(), this time as Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet. The dealership has assigned the $5 million advertising account to Baldi Bloom & Whelan Inc., New York, the same agency that handled Potamkin's advertising from from 1979 to 1987.
10/11/1991	Potamkin, Cadillac Maven, Is Back	Cadillac executives never questioned Victor Potamkin's ability to sell cars during his 15 years as a Cadillac dealer. But his flashy, low-price pitches to New Yorkers did not always square with the auto maker's high-style marketing approach. Now, after Mr Potamkin sat it out for four years while Cadillac floundered with a more refined approach, Cadillac officials have decided that the 80-year-old Mr. Potamkin knows New Yorkers. Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet is scheduled to open Tuesday at the same stand where Mr. Potamkin sold Cadillacs from 1972 to 1987.
9/20/1991	G.M. Will Lease Tools to Get a Tax Break	"The General Motors Corporation for the first time will raise money from investors by leasing machine tools rather than owning them, the company said today. G.M., which has been unprofitable in its North American automotive operations and therefore unable to use the tax advantages from depreciation of tools, said it was creating two """"pass-through trusts"""" to raise $480 million. The company did not disclose how it plans to use the money."
9/15/1991	Penguins and Pontiacs in Middle Age	I REMEMBER 1957. It was the International Geophysical Year and I was in the Navy at the South Pole, trying to stay warm, running around after scientists and occasionally watching my buddies feed Budweiser to the penguins. What I don't remember was Pontiac's introduction of the Bonneville, but that's what the company did that year, making 630 of them available as convertibles with 315-horsepower V8's, which was Pontiac's first engine with fuel injection.
9/1/1991	Making a Difference; Cadillac Answers a Foreign Challenge	"Two years ago, John O. Grettenberger promised that Cadillac would deliver a car to compete with the Lexus and Infiniti luxury cars from Japan. Many doubted that Cadillac was up to the task. But some former critics are now describing the 1992 Seville and Eldorado models, arriving in showrooms this week, with words usually reserved for Japanese and European automobiles. The new Seville STS """"is an extremely competent car that really puts the sport into sports sedan,"""" Automobile magazine says."
9/1/1991	A Bad Year, but the G.M. Plant in North Tarrytown Hangs On	THE forecast for the American automobile industry this year was grim from the start, but unpredictable events, particularly the war in the Persian Gulf, distracted car buyers and added to the industry's problems. The General Motors plant in North Tarrytown, which employs 3,100 people, was idle a total of 11 weeks from January through August, an average of one of every three weeks so far this year. That is worse than what union leaders and G.M. management had predicted and a few weeks more down time than at most other G.M. plants in the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group.
8/20/1991	McDonnell Sale To G.M. Unit	The McDonnell Douglas Corporation said yesterday that it would sell its engineering software division to the Electronic Data Systems Corporation of Dallas. A spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas said the price was still being negotiated and declined to provide any details of the deal's terms. In a statement, McDonnell Douglas said the sale of the unit, known as the McDonnell Douglas Systems Integration Company, would enable it to reduce its nearly $3 billion in debt. In a letter to employees, the aerospace company's chairman, John F. McDonnell, said the deal would also allow McDonnell Douglas to work with E.D.S,, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, on improving the unit's Unigraphics software. Unigraphics is used in the design and development of the company's aerospace products.
7/28/1991	High Technology on a Large Scale	SAY what you will, there is still nothing like a big American sedan, at least for those of us who grew up lusting after Lincolns and Packards and Cadillacs. True, the likes of the new Lexus coupe make the luxury market a delightfully different ball game, but some of the domestic entries must be given their due. Lincoln's Town Car is an exercise in quiet mobility, for example, and it is a car that I would happily own. Cadillacs, too, have been a longtime love, and I have owned a bunch of them, making me a member of a very large club. The other members have been uncommonly reticent this year, but even with bad days piling up in showroom upon showroom, Cadillac remains the nation's leading luxomobile.
7/26/1991	G.M., Ford Again Post Big Losses	The nation's two largest car companies reported big losses yesterday, G.M. for the fourth consecutive quarter and Ford for the third, reflecting lower production and weak demand for cars and trucks in most markets -- particularly the United States. The General Motors Corporation said it lost $785 million in the second quarter. The No. 2 auto maker, the Ford Motor Company, posted a quarterly loss of $324 million.
7/25/1991	2d-Quarter Earnings Drop For 2 Subsidiaries of G.M.	The General Motors Corporation, whose automotive earnings have been hit hard by the recession, saw the second-quarter profits of two important non-automotive subsidiaries decline. G.M.'s finance subsidiary and electronics and aerospace units both posted lower profit yesterday, in large measure because they are dependent on automotive sales. A third unit, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, showed a strong increase in profits.
7/22/1991	Workers Vote to End Strike at a G.M. Plant	Striking auto workers have overwhelmingly approved an agreement to end a 26-day walkout over safety issues at a General Motors Corporation plant that builds minivans. More than 99 percent of the plant's 3,200 workers voted Saturday to approve the agreement, said Sunny Biedrzycki, a spokesman for United Auto Workers Local 239.
7/20/1991	G.M. to Close Two Plants, Cut 6,000 Jobs	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would close two North American assembly plants, one in Van Nuys, Calif., and one in Scarborough, Ontario, putting almost 6,000 people out of work. G.M.'s move is in line with the pledge by Robert C. Stempel, the chairman, to balance the productive capacity of the No. 1 auto maker with demand for its vehicles by 1992. Despite several plant closings since 1986, dwindling G.M. vehicle sales in the United States and Canada have resulted in more plant space and output than the company needs.
7/20/1991	Workers Back G.M. Plan	Workers at the General Motors Corporation's huge car-making complex in Lordstown, Ohio, overwhelmingly endorsed a new production plan that G.M. hopes will make the factory more efficient, a union official said. In voting on Wednesday and Thursday, about 5,000 members of the United Automobile Workers union Local 1112 approved the local agreement by a 2-to-1 margin, said Al Alli, a union shop chairman. Specific vote totals were not available.
7/16/1991	G.M. Debt Offering For $700 Million	The General Motors Corporation is offering a total of $700 million in debt securities, divided into two tranches, through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company. The first part of the financing includes $400 million in 9 1/8 percent securiities, due 2001, that are priced at 99.925, to yield 9.136 percent, or about 87.5 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
7/12/1991	E.D.S. Extends SD-Scicon Deadline	The Electronic Data Systems Corporation, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, said it was extending its $195 million takeover offer for SD-Scicon P.L.C., the British computing services company. Because only 27 percent of SD-Scicon's shares have been tendered, E.D.S. extended the deadline to July 24. The offer, made on June 11, was to have expired on Wednesday.
7/11/1991	Van-Dumping Study Voted	The International Trade Commission voted today to continue investigating complaints by the Big Three American auto makers that Japanese competitors were illegally dumping mini-vans on the United States market. The three-member commission unanimously found reasonable grounds to believe that the American industry had been damaged by the Japanese trade practices.
7/9/1991	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Oldsmobile's New Pitch: Engineering	"OLDSMOBILE introduced a new generation of advertising yesterday. But after saying for several years that """"This is not your father's Oldsmobile,"""" the latest ads make the car sound an awful lot like just that. Long struggling to find its niche in a crowded market, Oldsmobile has dropped the sprightly """"new generation of Olds"""" tagline in favor of a more traditional approach: """"The power of intelligent engineering."
7/7/1991	About Cars; In the Doldrums, a New Lease on Life	"HERE he comes, Steve Betz, with his zero-down-$199-a-month-Grand Am. He is Pontiac's manager of marketing in the New York zone, and he is, as they say, all het up. Leasing is his baby, and the excitement comes at a time when sales are nothing to write to the home office about. But then he has this plan. . . . """"There are 18 zones in the country,"""" Betz said, """"and we're the only one that sold more Grand Ams this year than last. It's been a tough year in the automobile business, but the Grand Am and the Grand Prix are 70 percent of our business. And, since we started the plan, 37 percent of our business also is leasing."
7/4/1991	Vehicle Sales Dip, but Selling Rate Picks Up	Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 10.1 percent in late June compared with an unusually strong period a year earlier. On a seasonally adjusted basis, however, the results provided new evidence that the sluggish American automotive market is gaining strength. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 7.4 million for the June 21-30 period, the highest rate since late December. The late June rate compared with an 8.1 million rate a year earlier and a 6.5 million rate in mid-June.
7/3/1991	G.M.'s Plan for a Nearly Nonstop Auto Plant	The General Motors Corporation and a local chapter of the United Automobile Workers union have tentatively agreed to begin near-nonstop assembly operations at G.M.'s Lordstown, Ohio, plant starting next summer. The step would enable G.M. to effectively produce as many cars at one plant as the company can now assemble in two. The move represents a growing trend among American auto makers to cut costs by wringing more use from existing plants. The Chrysler Corporation, for example, has an agreement with the U.A.W. to step up mini-van production, if needed, by using three shifts instead of the usual two.
7/1/1991	In Walkout at a G.M. Plant, Pay and Benefits Are Beside the Point	Randy Yates walked the picket line outside the General Motors minivan plant under a punishing sun, his shirt dark with sweat, and talked about why his co-workers were striking for reasons that have nothing to do with wages or benefits. Since 400 workers were laid off in February at the plant on the Baltimore waterfront, Mr. Yates and his colleagues said, the remaining workers have had to work faster to keep up with the assembly line. They said the pace had led to numerous injuries.
6/22/1991	G.M. Prepares To Offer 'Percs'	"Investment bankers for General Motors canvassed Wall Street yesterday to test the waters for a security that is expected to be priced next week. The new security, known as """"percs,"""" for performance equity redemption cumulative stock, is essentially a way for G.M. to sell common stock at a price to be set later. Investors will pay for the preferred security in 1991, but the amount of common stock they will later get depends on the price of G.M.'s common shares over the next three years. The more the share price rises, the less stock an investor in the percs will receive."
6/20/1991	Groups Explore Effort For Rights to the Clios	"In the wake of the problems that plagued the 1991 Clio Awards, at least two groups are exploring the possibility of taking over sponsorship of the awards. Herbert Rickman, president of New York Pride, a not-for-profit foundation that promotes New York City, said that four top advertising executives had asked his organization to consider running the Clios. """"It's not in our current scope, but our board has talked about it,"""" said Mr. Rickman, who was liaison to the advertising industry for Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor of New York."
6/20/1991	G.M. to Recall 700 Workers	"Because of strong sales and low inventories for the Pontiac Grand Prix, the General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it will add a second shift and recall about 700 workers by September at its Fairfax plant in Kansas City, Kan. """"It's just how we read the market that gives us the confidence to do this,"""" said Nettie Seabrooks, a G.M. spokeswoman. The Grand Prix's daily selling rate for the last 30 days was the highest since October, and dealer inventories were the lowest since May 1988, the company said."
6/20/1991	Coke-to-G.M. Shift Is Set At McCann	"SEAN FITZPATRICK, the advertising creative executive who produced the Chevrolet """"Heartbeat of America"""" campaign, was named to an important new assignment yesterday at the McCann-Erickson Worldwide agency, where, among other duties, he will handle worldwide advertising for the General Motors Corporation. Industry executives who were familiar with details of Mr. Fitzpatrick's appointment before it was announced said the move could also have reverberations beyond G.M., involving two other advertising giants: Coca-Cola and American Express."
6/18/1991	Poles Report G.M. Venture	The General Motors Corporation plans to announce a venture with the Polish state-owned car maker FSO, an FSO spokesman said today. But an official at G.M. of Europe denied that a deal was imminent. The FSO spokesman, Andrzej Smolinski, said the plan was to be announced on Tuesday and would be presented to Prime Minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who is also considering a competing offer from Fiat S.p.A. of Italy.
6/13/1991	G.M. Warranties	The General Motors Corporation will waive the $100 deductible for warranty work after the first 12 months of coverage for its 1992 cars and light trucks. The warranty on a 1992 model will cover the entire vehicle for three years or 36,000 miles. Warranties for 1989-91 models were effective for three years or 50,000 miles and had a $100 deductible after the first 12 months or 12,000 miles.
6/9/1991	Buick Hunts The Future In Its Past	"I HAD one of my nicer letters recently from a 10-year-old named Michael C. Koch, who described himself as """"Your favorite reader."""" """"I love cars just as you,"""" Michael said. He wrote in pencil and he said kind things. But what he really wanted to know, he added, was how to learn about automobiles and how I learned about them myself."
6/8/1991	Auto Worker Dissidents Gain	Members of a dissident labor group have ousted leaders of the United Automobile Workers union at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., known as Nummi, a joint venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation in Fremont, Calif. In elections on Wednesday, the candidate of the dissident group, the People's Caucus, defeated the incumbent president of the local. Members of the dissident group were elected to three of five other top union positions. The caucus, which is loosely affiliated with a national U.A.W. dissident group called New Directions, argues for a more traditional, adversarial relationship between the union and management.
5/30/1991	A Texas Official Questions G.M. Ad	"The Texas Attorney General is threatening to sue the General Motors Corporation on charges of deceptive advertising about how its Cadillac division won the Government's Baldrige Quality Award. Representatives of G.M. and Texas Attorney General Dan Morales were scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss a settlement. In some newspaper ads, General Motors said that """"167,000 different companies"""" applied for the award. But only 97 companies actually applied, including 45 in the category of big companies that included Cadillac."
5/30/1991	U.S. Auto Makers' Research Venture	The Big Three auto makers formed a research consortium to study automotive electronics. The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation said the High Speed Serial Data Research and Development Partnership would conduct research and develop devices that electronically process data from components like brakes and direction sensors. The venture must be approved by the Justice Department, but little opposition is likely.
5/29/1991	G.M. Brazil Unit Moving	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would move its Latin American operations from Brazil to Miami after Robert B. Stone retired as the unit's head on Sept. 1. Mr. Stone, 60 years old, will be succeeded by Richard C. Nerod, currently president and managing director of G.M. de Mexico. The move is part of a restructuring of G.M.'s Latin American operations.
5/19/1991	Oldsmobile Rolls Out a Sporty Truck	Last year, for the first time in almost seven decades, Oldsmobile returned to the business of building trucks -- sort of. The offering was the Silhouette, one of three new vans from General Motors, and if it wasn't a truck by all definitions, it was the next best thing, a sleek, pointy-nosed people hauler with a plastic body and aerodynamic good looks.
5/19/1991	One Bet Lost, General Motors Places Another	"Financial engineers at General Motors have a tradition of being more creative than their automotive counterparts. But it is arguable as to which group is more responsible for the company's current need for cash. It is that need for cash that led to G.M.'s latest financial innovation, something it calls """"percs."
5/16/1991	Where Car Makers Fear to Cut	"Auto executives traditionally do not discuss future car and truck models for fear buyers might put off a purchase until the new ones arrive. But the Chrysler Corporation took that risk by recently allowing dealers, journalists and others onto its test track to give them a glimpse of the 1993 mid-size models on which Chrysler is pinning its hopes for a recovery. The slump in car sales and the national recession, which coincide with yet another big push by the Japanese for American market share, is squeezing Detroit and causing a torrent of cash to flow out the door. All of the auto makers are cutting costs and conserving resources. What they are struggling to avoid, though, are any deep cuts that would delay or eliminate new products. A Matter of Perceptions Chrysler, like the others in the Big Three, does not want investors, suppliers or lenders to get the idea that it is paring spending for new models, a perception that would only worsen its problems on the showroom floor. The pressure to spend, even when money is scarce, is a matter of market share for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and a matter of survival for Chrysler. All three are striving to avoid having their need to save money force them into canceling or delaying important vehicle projects. G.M. on Monday announced plans to float an issue of preference stock to raise $600 million, partly to pay for future vehicle models, among them eight new-car and thee new-truck models in the next year. """"Spending for new products must go on in good times and bad,"""" said James B. Fitzpatrick, a G.M. vice president for communications and marketing. """"It is our lifeblood."""" Cash generated internally at G.M. has shrunk from $10.08 billion in 1987 to an estimated $5.27 billion this year, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Japanese auto makers can develop a new vehicle in far less time than Detroit can, and they are invading market niches in the United States where they have never been before. Today, for example, Nissan showed journalists its first mini-van, named the Quest. It was designed in California and will be built at a Ford plant near Cleveland starting next April. Last year, Nissan withdrew from the market its Axxess station wagon that was meant to attract mini-van buyers but was a flop. American auto makers know they cannot compete unless they compress their normal five-year product-gestation period to three years, like the Japanese, and bring out more new cars more frequently. Indeed, the most scathing criticism that could be leveled at the American auto industry would be to say that it was mortgaging the future by scrimping on new-product development. But new products take money. Depending on the extent of the redesign, the cost of bringing a new car to dealer lots ranges from $500 million to $1 billion. While G.M. has been able to keep most models on schedule, it has acknowledged a few delays. Rumors among parts suppliers say G.M. has delayed its redesigned S-10 Blazer utility vehicle to 1995, from 1994. Taking on More Debt As for Ford, it borrowed $800 million in the first quarter of the year, raising its debt to $8.2 billion; a year ago, debt stood at $4.4 billion. Ford's debt-to-equity ratio on March 31 was 38 percent, compared with 16 percent a year ago. Ford is trying to keep most future models on schedule, but analysts and suppliers say it has delayed the redesign of the Taurus and the Sable models for one year, to 1995. After Ford announced a first-quarter loss of $884 million, David N. McCammon, vice president-finance, said projects """"are basically intact, but we always are making timing adjustments"""" to cut costs and looking for ways """"to get a dollar's worth of new products for every 80 cents we spend."""" Chrysler, which has suffered critical losses and has little financial cushion, has the least borrowing power among the Big Three, the lowest relative stock price, and the least ability to put money into new products. But Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., said Chrysler more than any other American auto maker might be trying to pull spending forward. Perhaps because of its well-publicized financial weakness, the No. 3 auto maker must go to the greatest lengths to prove that its $3 billion in cost-cutting is not hampering development of new models. The company renegotiated a $1.5 billion line of credit after the lowering of its debt ratings made borrowing from the public too expensive. """"The fear is that Chrysler is cutting into muscle and bone,"""" said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. """"But I hope not, because I love the way the L/H looks."""" He was referring to the code name for Chrysler's 1993 mid-size sedan, which will be sold by the Eagle, Dodge and Chrysler divisions; it will be built, starting next year, at a factory in Bramalea, Ontario. Other Chrysler vehicles badly need replacement, too. The full-size pickup truck -- referred to by some Chrysler engineers as """"Festus,"""" the grizzled codger in the """"Gunsmoke"""" television western -- has not been redesigned for more than 15 years. Chrysler is planning to replace it in 1993. No Profits, No Cash In economically healthy times auto makers pay part of their new-product costs with cash from current sales. But with no profits, auto makers must increase borrowings or sell equity. In the last six months, the Big Three have been forced to trim dividends and drastically cut costs to strengthen balance sheets enough to finance new-product spending. One-time expenses have also been a drain on cash. G.M., for example, was obligated on March 1 to buy $600 million worth of its class H stock from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as part of the renegotiated terms of the sale of Hughes Aircraft to G.M. in 1985. The three-year labor contract negotiated in the fall with the United Automobile Workers union has become a huge financial burden as well. Under its terms, the Big Three must pay most workers even if they are laid off, a situation that makes labor costs akin to a fixed expense. In previous recessions, labor expenses went down as sales and production dropped, allowing auto makers to keep losses in check. In 1982, under an earlier labor agreement, the industry was operating at only 62 percent of capacity, yet auto makers were breaking even. But last year, utilization was at 78 percent and still the industry lost about $5 billion in North America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. The Cost of Competition Of course, foreign imports and transplants -- Japanese cars made in America -- were not as much of a factor during the last recession. Vicious competition is hurting the Big Three's ability to maintain prices. Even with much lower production, the auto makers have been forced to continue offering large rebates on most car and truck models -- another drain on cash. Shorter development cycles for cars like Chrysler's L/H model should help to cut costs, analysts say. Chrysler will have brought the L/H out in 42 months, a 30 percent reduction in the typical development time, helping produce a 25 percent cut in development costs, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein. Chrysler believes the length of the cycle will be about 39 months, said Glen Gardner, who heads the project; that compares with the Japanese average of about 36 months. """"The trick is going to be to get the rest of our projects on this schedule,"""" he said."
5/16/1991	G.M. Ends Reatta	Production of the Reatta, a sporty two-seat Buick, has ended to make way for a new electric car by the General Motors Corporation. The last Reatta came off the assembly line on Tuesday. Although G.M. has not said officially, the company is expected to build a version of its Impact electric car at the plant by 1993. Through May 10, G.M. had sold 1,008 Reattas, down 60.2 percent from the same time a year ago. During its four years in production at the Craft Centre plant, about 21,000 Reattas were built. About 500 workers will be laid off at the plant, as maintenance and cleanup work is done.
5/14/1991	COMPANY NEWS; G.M. to Sell Special Stock, Raising Cash	Betting on a bright future, the General Motors Corporation said today that it planned to raise as much as $600 million by selling an unusual type of stock that will save money for the company if the price of its common shares rises, but will cost it money if the common stock declines. General Motors, which cut its dividend by nearly half in February and later announced a loss of $1.1 billion for the first quarter, needs the money to improve its weakened cash flow. The company, the world's largest auto maker, said it planned to use the money for its global automotive and financing operations.
5/11/1991	New Saturn Setback; G.M. to Replace Cars	The General Motors Corporation's bid to make and market a small car that directly challenges Japanese models suffered a serious blow today when its Saturn Corporation announced a second recall and made an unprecedented offer to replace 1,836 cars with faulty engine-cooling systems. Saturn's second recall comes just seven months after the company began making cars in a slow start-up undertaken to insure high quality. Saturn cars, which have base sticker prices of $7,995 to $11,775, are just reaching dealerships nationwide. Until recently, the cars were sold mostly in the South and the West.
5/8/1991	Mr. Gephardt's Design for Monopolies	Representative Richard Gephardt is sponsoring a pernicious bill that threatens to raise consumer costs each year by hundreds of millions, perhaps more. The proposed Design Protection Act of 1991 promises to safeguard product designs from unfair imitation, especially foreign. What it would really do is hand over monopoly rights to manufacturers of ordinary household items. Want to buy cheap substitutes for brand name items at the local grocery store? Forget it: Mr. Gephardt's bill would make everyday items the sole property right of the original manufacturer, from the shape of the spout on laundry detergent packages to the shape of pencil erasers. Want to buy low-cost replacement bumpers for your General Motors car? Forget it: G.M. would gain sole right to sell many crash parts for its cars. Because of the extra money car owners would have to spend, insurance premiums might rise by $300 million a year.
5/7/1991	Cadillac's Bid to Recapture Youth	After a decade of sluggish sales and new-product disappointments like the Cimarron and the Allante, Cadillac is putting the final touches on a redesigned Seville, the latest attempt to get the prestige division of General Motors back into the luxury car ball game where the Japanese are the new stars.This time, though, auto experts believe that Cadillac could have a hit. In the cheerless Motor City, the 1992 Seville is getting praise for offering one of the freshest designs since 1976, when the first Seville made its debut and became a styling pacesetter for large American cars.
5/3/1991	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the quarterly reports of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company misstated Ford's first-quarter revenue in some editions. It was $21.3 billion, down 9.7 percent from $23.6 billion in the comparable quarter last year. The article also misstated the first-quarter performance of two of G.M.'s non-automotive units in some editions. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation had lower, not higher, profits; the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation had lower profits, not a loss.
5/2/1991	G.M. Outlet In Manhattan Closes Doors	The last remaining General Motors Corporation dealership in Manhattan, a Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet franchise belonging to Roger S. Penske and G.M., quietly closed its doors today. Mr. Penske is a transportation entrepreneur with interests as diverse as truck leasing and Indianapolis 500 racing. A spokesman for Mr. Penske said the decision to close the dealership was based on declining prospects for automobile sales in New York City and the poor state of the Northeast economy.
5/1/1991	Big Losses For Ford And G.M.	The nation's two biggest auto makers announced huge first-quarter losses today. The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest car maker, reported a net loss of $377 million. It would have reported a $1.1 billion loss except for one-time gains from an accounting change and the sale of the G.M. Building in New York.
4/30/1991	Non-Automotive G.M. Units Post Mixed Income Results	The non-automotive subsidiaries of the General Motors Corporation posted mixed first-quarter results today. The Electronic Data Systems Corporation reported a 10.9 percent profit increase, the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation reported a 37.7 percent drop and the General Motors Acceptance Corporation posted a 9 percent decrease. Although the three G.M. units were profitable, their earnings will not be enough to overcome weak automotive results. When G.M. releases its results on Tuesday, analysts expect it to report an overall deficit of about $1 billion. Like the rest of the United States auto industry, the world's largest car maker is suffering from lower sales and from expenses it says are too high. On the New York Stock Exchange today, G.M.'s shares closed at $34, off $2.375.
4/16/1991	Big Pay Cut for G.M. Chief in 1990	The General Motors Corporation's new chairman and chief executive took a big pay cut in 1990, reflecting a dismal year for the industry and the nation's No. 1 auto maker. Robert C. Stempel, 57 years old, took over the top post at G.M. in August. He received total compensation of $1,075,000 last year, a 51 percent drop from the $2,212,000 he received in 1989, when he was president. The information was in the company's annual proxy statement.
4/5/1991	Japanese Improve Share as U.S. Car Sales Decline	Against a backdrop of sluggish sales in March, Japanese auto makers improved their share of the American automotive market at the expense of the Big Three domestic auto makers. In late March, car sales in the United States were off 7.8 percent, to 232,240, compared with 279,996 a year earlier. Light-truck sales were off 8 percent to 130,213, from 157,185 last year. There were 9 sales days in the latest period compared with 10 last year; percentage changes are based on the average daily rate.
4/2/1991	In Europe, Too, Auto Sales Sag	Executives of Europe's major car manufacturers speak of the Germans these days with reverence, and for good reason: The booming German market is all that separates the European car industry from disaster. Those who speak most reverently are executives of Volkswagen A.G. and the General Motors Corporation, whose companies are the strongest there. But with sagging markets elsewhere, those companies depending on the rest of Western Europe for most of their sales are threatened with a tough, if not terrible, year.
4/1/1991	Trophy Car For Indy Winner	MANY major league baseball players have bats and gloves with their signatures on them, so it figures a race car driver would choose a car when selling something with his signature. Rick Mears, a three-time Indianapolis 500 winner, and Larry Shinoda have collaborated on the Rick Mears-edition Corvette ZR-1. The car, a copy of which is on display at the New York Automobile Show this week at the Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan, is basically a Corvette with more aerodynamic body work.
3/30/1991	G.M. Recalls School Buses	The General Motors Corporation recalled 15,000 Chevrolet school buses on Thursday because of a potential drivetrain problem. It also recalled about 418,000 1987-90 cars equipped with Quad 4 engines -- Oldsmobile Calais and Cutlass Supremes, Pontiac Grand Ams, Buick Skylarks and Chevrolet Berettas -- because of potential emission problems. The company said it was unaware of any accidents or injuries caused by the problems. Repairs in both recalls will be performed free.
3/30/1991	Auto Layoffs Decline	The Big Three auto makers plan to lay off just 12,050 hourly workers next week, the smallest weekly number of the year. The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation said Thursday that they would close all or parts of just six assembly plants to bring their products into balance with inventories.
3/30/1991	Can 'Image' Cars Help Detroit?	Can one sexy car model make a whole company look good? Detroit has gambled for decades that the answer is yes and sometimes it has been right. The GTO revved up Pontiac's stodgy image in the 60's, much the way the Shelby Mustang put some pizazz behind Ford. There have not been many successes since then. In the mid-80's, the Pontiac Fiero, a two-seat sports car with a glass fiber body caught the eye of showroom shoppers until its engine developed a tendency to catch fire.
3/27/1991	Market Place; Analysts Split On G.M.'s Fate	AUTO MAKERS typically lose money in sour economies, then make it back in spades during prosperity. But the General Motors Corporation's $1.6 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1990 was so staggering that it has split Wall Street over whether the No. 1 auto maker can recover its earning power when the economy improves. G.M.'s profitability and dividend payout are critical issues for millions of investors. As one of the most widely held stocks and an institutional favorite, G.M. is the subject of much debate and strongly held opinions among financial analysts. The auto maker tracks the recommendations of 13 leading analysts; currently, 7 are recommending purchase of the stock, 3 are neutral and 3 are recommending sale.
3/27/1991	Fitch Ratings Agency Gives Warning on G.M. and Ford	"Fitch Investors Serviceei, expressing concern about the profitability of the nation's two largest auto makers, said today that it might reduce the senior debt ratings of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation. Fitch said the AA senior debt rating of G.M. and the AA senior debt rating of Ford had been placed on an """"alert"""" status with negative implications. A spokesman said the intention was to alert investors that the ratings might be lowered after further discussions with the companies, which will take place within two weeks."
3/27/1991	Big 3 Set Up Pollution Study	The nation's Big Three auto makers said today that they had formed a joint research project to study the environmental effects of automobile emissions and manufacturing. The effort is the third of its kind by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, which are also involved in joint research in plastics and batteries.
3/26/1991	U.S. Says Import Relief Is Unlikely for Detroit	White House officials said today that the Administration was unlikely to ask Japan for further restraints on auto exports to the United States to ease the financial plight of domestic auto makers, but that it could offer such assistance as a temporary easing of some regulatory requirements. The statement was made as the White House confirmed that the heads of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler met President Bush last Wednesday in an unannounced session. The auto executives met with Mr. Bush just a few hours before the President welcomed the Japanese Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, and agreed upon April 4 in Los Angeles for the next meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
3/23/1991	Retirement Study at G.M.	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union are negotiating how to get some hourly workers to retire early, according to union and company officials who asked not to be identified. The workers in question are in so-called jobs banks, employment pools established at factories during work force reductions. Employees in the banks get full pay while they perform non-traditional automotive work, like community service, or attend retraining classes.
3/20/1991	G.M. Deal With Time Warner	The General Motors Corporation and Time Warner Inc. announced an agreement yesterday under which the auto maker is expected to spend $80 million over the next year to advertise in a number of the media company's ventures, including Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines. General Motors also has an option to develop special marketing and advertising programs in other areas of Time Warner, including cable television, home video,films and books.
3/17/1991	Ideas & Trends; Saturn: An Outpost of Change in G.M.'s Steadfast Universe	"EIGHT years ago, the General Motors Corporation boasted that its futuristic Saturn project would revolutionize the auto industry. By starting with a """"clean sheet of paper,"""" G.M. said, it would rethink everything from manufacturing and design methods to the often stormy relationship between management and labor. Now that a few thousand Saturn cars are on the road, 62 dealerships are operating and a second daily work shift is about to start at Saturn's new factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., it is clear that the $2 billion project has not produced a revolutionary car. Though the Saturn wins high marks for quality, it is not radically different from other American cars. But Saturn has become a company with a management style unlike anything found elsewhere in the farflung G.M. empire."
3/11/1991	Agencies Caution Clients On Using Patriotic Themes	"The temptation to wave the flag in ads seems nearly irresistible now -- companies like the General Motors Corporation and Delta Air Lines Inc. are already using patriotic themes -- but many agency executives said in recent interviews that trying to capitalize on the victory in the Persian Gulf war was a mistake. """"It is inappropriate to use the war as a selling tool,"""" said Stephen Novick, an executive vice president and co-creative director at Grey Advertising. """"Most consumers are going to see right through the gimmick, and they are bound to view it as pseudo-patriotic."
3/10/1991	G.M. Plant Is Struggling But Hopeful	"WORKERS at the General Motors plant here have seen their share of hard times, and last year was no exception, with 450 workers laid off indefinitely in July and another 450 in November. Then, in January and February, the deepening recession and the war in the Persian Gulf struck a double blow to the automobile industry. Consumers hesitate to buy """"big ticket"""" items like cars in times of uncertainty, auto industry analysts say."
3/6/1991	Several Midlevel Shifts Are Announced by G.M.	"The General Motors Corporation yesterday announced a series of medium-tier executive changes. The moves, approved by the G.M. board, """"will further strengthen G.M.'s marketing and manufacturing operations,"""" Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, said."
3/5/1991	G.M. Picks Michigan Plant For Building Its Electric Car	The General Motors Corporation took a big step today toward producing the first commercially available electric car in modern time, announcing that it had selected a small factory in Lansing, Mich., as the production site. Although G.M. provided few details, citing competitive factors, the company's timetable implied that production could begin as early as next year, which would mean a 1993 model could appear in dealer showrooms a year from this fall.
3/4/1991	Site Selection For G.M. Car	The General Motors Corporation is close to announcing that its Impact electric car will be assembled in low volume at a plant in Lansing, Mich., an automotive industry newsletter has reported. G.M. executives have not said when they plan to begin making the small, highly aerodynamic car. Speculation about a manufacturing site had centered on a G.M. plant in Van Nuys, Calif.
3/2/1991	Auto Makers' Layoff Plans	The Big Three auto makers will have 38,950 auto workers on layoff next week as all or part of 17 assembly plants are closed because of slow sales and model changeovers. The number is down slightly from the 41,000 workers who were on layoff this week.
2/26/1991	G.M. in Plans On Natural Gas	The General Motors Corporation and the Gas Research Institute said they would spend $39 million to develop trucks that run on cleaner-burning natural gas. The auto maker and the gas-company group said production could begin by the mid 1990's. G.M. will spend $24.1 million and the institute will spend $15.2 million to engineer and develop the light- and medium- duty trucks, a G.M. spokeswoman, Kari Hulsey, said. Initially, a limited number of trucks would be produced for field research, she added. The institute's members include Brooklyn Union Gas, Columbia Gas System, Consolidated Natural Gas, Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Gas. G.M. has not made plans for producing the trucks once the engineering and development program is over. But Ms. Hulsey said any medium-duty trucks would be built at its Janesville, Wis., truck plant. G.M.'s GMC truck division announced a project last July to produce at least 1,000 natural-gas powered pickup trucks this year for use in Texas and California. Those vehicles are being converted for natural- gas use by an outside company, Ms. Hulsey said.
2/25/1991	Ford Leads in Car Layoffs	More than half of the 41,000 auto workers scheduled for temporary layoff this week will come from the Ford Motor Company. The Big Three auto makers said last week that they planned to shut down all or parts of 21 assembly plants, all because of lagging car and truck sales. Workers from the General Motors Corporation, Ford and the Chrysler Corporation who are affected by the shutdowns are eligible for benefit packages intended to give them 95 percent of their regular wages while laid off because of sales slowdowns. About 22,050 Ford assembly plant workers will be laid off this week. A Ford spokesman, Joel H. Pitcoff, said car plants in Chicago; Dearborn and Wayne, Mich., and Lorain, Ohio, would be shut down. Truck plants in Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis; Wayne; Norfolk, Va.; St. Paul, and its medium-duty Kentucky truck plant in Louisville will be closed. Truck plants in Edison, N.J., and Lorain will be working on one shift each instead of the usual two. G.M. is closing car plants in Linden, N.J.; Doraville, Ga.; Oklahoma City, and Ste. Therese, Quebec, and laying off one of two shifts at its Ypsilanti, Mich., factory. The only truck plant affected by a closing is the Scarborough, Ontario, van plnt, which will go to one from two shifts next week. In all, 14,000 G.M. workers will be laid off. Chrysler will lay off about 4,900 workers when it closes its car plants in Bramalea, Ontario, and St. Louis and its truck plant in Warren, Mich.
2/24/1991	Chevrolet Ranks High and Low in New Crash Tests	A front-seat passenger in the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice is vulnerable to serious or even fatal head injury in a crash, while the Chevrolet Beretta's air bag and seat belts make serious injury unlikely, according to Government tests of seven new vehicles. And the test results show that both the driver and the front-seat passenger in the Chevrolet Blazer 4x4, a multipurpose vehicle, are vulnerable -- even more so than in the Caprice.
2/18/1991	Truck Slump Adds to Woes Of Big Three	The woes of the domestic automobile industry are being aggravated by a decline in the sales of some of its most profitable products: full-size pickup trucks and vans. Sales of light trucks, which include pickup trucks, vans and sports-utility vehicles, declined 7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, while automobile sales rose 1 percent. In the most recent 10-day sales period, sales of light trucks were off 31.2 percent.
2/16/1991	G.M. Sets Meeting	The General Motors Corporation will hold its annual meeting this year in Nashville, instead of Detroit, for the first time in 27 years. G.M. said on Thursday that the meeting would take place May 24 at the Opryland convention center, about 50 miles northeast of G.M.'s Saturn Corporation assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. It will be the first annual meeting run by Robert Stempel, who became chairman on Aug. 1 after the retirement of Roger B. Smith. The last time G.M. held an annual meeting outside Detroit was in 1964 in Wilmington, Del.
2/15/1991	Big Losses For G.M. And Ford	Saying that war and recession had shattered consumer confidence, the nation's two biggest auto makers today reported huge fourth-quarter losses. General Motors, with a $1.62 billion deficit, and Ford, with $519 million, said sales had dried up faster than they could cut costs. Both companies said losses seem likely to continue for several months as they had seen no signs of a rebound in sales yet. Both also said they would intensify efforts to cut costs.
2/15/1991	Real Estate Group Buys G.M. Building	One of the country's largest private real estate investment groups quietly acquired the landmark General Motors Building in Manhattan last month, people at G.M. said yesterday. The headquarters building was sold for $500 million plus other unspecified considerations, they said. The 50-story building was acquired by Corporate Property Investors, the real estate investment trust that refinanced the property for G.M. in the early 1980's and in exchange received the option to acquire the building, on Fifth Avenue at the southeastern corner of Central Park, which opened in 1968.
2/14/1991	Strong Earnings Are Posted by Three G.M. Subsidiaries	The three non-automotive subsidiaries of the General Motors Corporation posted strong fourth-quarter earnings today, helping to alleviate the large decline in automotive profits that G.M. is expected to announce Thursday. Some financial analysts predict G.M. will announce losses of $1.4 billion for the quarter.
2/14/1991	Saturn Cars Being Recalled for Seat Defect	"The infant Saturn division of the General Motors Corporation said today that it was recalling about 25 percent of the more than 4,000 cars sold to customers to repair reclining mechanisms in the two front seats. While the defect does not appear serious, the recall could test Saturn's image and credibility with customers. A spokesman said the company was """"disappointed"""" but added that the defect was not significant from a safety standpoint. The defect was discovered in 19 cars, all sedan models. 1,210 Cars Affected Bruce MacDonald, Saturn's vice president of communications, said the recall would affect 1,210 cars. He said the company first grew suspicious of possible problems in November, after receiving a customer complaint. Saturn officials then received the 19 complaints, he said."
2/12/1991	G.M.'s Timetable On Antilock Brakes	Antilock brakes will be standard or optional equipment by 1993 on virtually all of the General Motors Corporation's cars and light trucks, G.M.'s chairman, Robert C. Stempel, said. Auto makers already offer antilock brakes on about 35 percent of all new trucks and cars, mainly luxury and large models. But new technology has allowed G.M. to design inexpensive systems that could be offered as options on compact cars, Mr. Stempel told the National Automobile Dealers Association on Saturday. Antilock brakes help prevent skidding on slippery roads or in sudden stops by varying braking pressure many times a second.
2/9/1991	Saab Is Closing Plant After Venture's Loss	Saab Automobile said today that it was closing its 18-month-old model production plant after the joint venture with the General Motors Corporation suffered an $840 million loss in 1990. Some of the 770 factory workers and 100 administrative personnel will be transferred to Saab's aircraft division. Others will be given the opportunity to move from Malmo, in southern Sweden, to the Trollhattan auto plant in western Sweden.
2/9/1991	More Cost Cutting Expected at Ford	"A senior executive of the Ford Motor Company said the automobile maker would intensify cost cutting in response to the industry's recession but would not lower capital spending as the General Motors Corporation has decided to do. Alexander J. Trotman, executive vice president of the No. 2 car maker and head of its North American operations, declined to elaborate on how Ford would further reduce costs but said, """"It's not business as usual."""" G.M., Ford and the Chrysler Corporation began cost-cutting programs in the late 1980's but have accelerated and deepened them as the American economy turned sour last year. Mr. Trotman's comments came at a press preview of the Chicago Auto Show, which opens on Saturday."
2/9/1991	Making Cars Harder to Steal: Smart Systems, Tough Locks	Making the most of antitheft technology, auto makers are bringing out new cars with highly advanced electronic controls as well as more pedestrian measures: metals that are harder to bend and locks that are tougher to pick. One of the most effective devices to be offered by auto makers as standard equipment is an electronic system that prevents a thief from starting the car. As electronic components have replaced mechanical components, auto makers have been able to design security systems that disable vital parts like the fuel pump if the proper key is not used. Variants of this technology have been introduced by the General Motors Corporation on several models and by the Toyota Motor Corporation on its fanciest Lexus luxury sedan.
2/7/1991	S.&P. Cuts Ratings of Detroit's Big 3	Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of all three top domestic auto makers today, underscoring the rapidly unraveling conditions in the industry and raising the prospect of higher borrowing costs. Analysts said the impact of the downgrades would be minimal for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, although borrowing may become marginally more expensive for the No. 1 and No. 2 domestic auto makers.
2/7/1991	Car Makers Revise Budgets In the Face of Slowing Sales	SOME leading auto makers are cutting advertising budgets substantially or deferring spending until later this year because of fears that recession and war will further depress sales, some automobile and advertising executives said yesterday. Although auto executives would not disclose advertising expenditures, some said both the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation had held back large amounts of ad dollars, perhaps as much as $100 million each, primarily from budgets earmarked for network television and magazines.
2/5/1991	G.M. Cuts Dividend Almost 50%	The General Motors Corporation, citing war and a weak economy, slashed its dividend nearly in half today and announced cost-cutting measures, including reductions in its salaried work force and its capital spending plans. G.M., the nation's largest car maker, was the first of the Big Three to trim its quarterly payout, dropping it by 46 percent, to 40 cents a share from 75 cents, but analysts predict that Ford and Chrysler will soon follow suit.
2/4/1991	Shutdowns Set By Car Makers	The nation's Big Three auto makers plan to shut 24 car and truck assembly plants this week, temporarily idling more than 62,000 workers because of a shortage of dealer orders, the companies said last week. The General Motors Corporation said that it would stop production at 11 of its United States and Canadian factories and that output at two plants would be cut in half. In all, 39,000 workers will be idled. The Ford Motor Company said 16,200 employees would be on temporary layoff as it shuts 10 North American car and truck assembly plants. The Chrysler Corporation said three plants would be closed, idling 7,150.
2/1/1991	3 Auto Makers In Battery Plan	"The Big Three United States auto makers said they had formed a joint effort to share the costs of developing batteries for electric vehicles. The Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation said they had pledged $35 million to the project. They said they want to raise $100 million annually by 1993 from the Government and electric utilities to support advanced battery research. The venture, called the United States Advanced Battery Consortium, plans to contract with battery manufacturers and other organizations to conduct research on advanced battery technology. The consortium, which had been expected, reflects a growing push by local governments in the country's most polluted areas to require """"ultra-clean"""" cars by the end of the century. Before auto makers can manufacture and market electric cars, however, they need batteries with enough power to accelerate vehicles to highway speeds and with enough storage capacity to keep vehicles running for 100 miles or more. John R. Wallace, director of Ford's electric vehicle programs, said the venture was inspired partly by a race with the Japanese."
2/1/1991	Gianettino & Merridith	Gianettino & Merridith, a small agency in Short Hills, N.J., has picked up several new accounts. Yesterday, the agency won the $8 million account for the Tri-State Chevrolet and Geo dealerships. Earlier in the week, it got the $1 million Hotel Bar butter business, owned by Borden Inc., and a $1 million account for Foster Wheeler, an engineering and construction company. The agency now has billings of about $83 million.
1/24/1991	Fast Start for G.M. Redesign Strategy	The new Buick Park Avenue sedan holds the distinction of being one of the few car models that has been selling briskly in a time of weak demand, and without the costly stimulus of rebates or other discounts. The Park Avenue's strong sales in the last four months have encouraged the General Motors Corporation in its efforts to recapture customers by offering newly redesigned models, while avoiding the negative financial impact of low-interest financing and subsidized leasing plans, as well as rebates.
1/20/1991	A Buick Show Car Takes to the Road	"Think luxury cars today and you'll probably think imports. Mercedes-Benz. BMW. Lexus. Infiniti. You might even think Lincoln or Cadillac, but you probably wouldn't think Buick. A big part of that, no doubt, is the pinch-penny philosophy that led General Motors to homogenize its cars in the 80's, building Buicks on the same line with Chevys and using parts from the same bins. Certainly, the lack of distinctive design hurt Cadillac, an insult to """"The Standard of the World"""" that has only recently been redressed."
1/20/1991	For Car Phones, Antenna Magic	Buick's solar-control glass is one of those quietly innovative materials that come along, and it is a good idea. The glass is produced by Libby-Owens-Ford and the company has gone on line with another interesting product, this one anticipating increases in the demand for car cellular phones, which now number about 4 million. The product, called GlasTenna, is a printed antenna system that is integrated into the back window of the vehicle, offering a smoother appearance and no tip-off to thieves. The antenna, which solves the problems of weather and wear, is designed as original equipment, meaning that a car coming from the factory would readily accommodate a telephone. Richard A. Sahler, GlasTenna's marketing director, said similar advances will let manufacturers eliminate the weight and drag of radio antennas in the near future.
1/18/1991	CBS and G.M. In Sports Pact	"The General Motors Corporation has signed a seven-year agreement with CBS Sports to be the exclusive United States automobile advertiser during coverage of N.C.A.A. basketball games. The terms are reported to be near $400 million, and the contract is believed to be the largest deal ever made involving advertising and sports. """"We're delighted to have their participation,"""" said Susan Kerr, director of communications at CBS. """"It's a deal that's unequaled in its stature and length for one sports event."""" G.M. did not return several calls made to its corporate offices. G.M.'s Chevrolet division has been the only domestic automobile advertiser for the Final Four tournament for several years."
1/13/1991	Chevy's Cab Picks Up Comment	"Last week's column on the new Chevrolet taxi seems to have touched a chord. Here are excerpts from three of the letters: Dear Sir, The last thing that this crowded city needs is a taxicab that is longer and wider than the former Chevrolet Caprice. Those who """"yearn for the way we were"""" should be yearning for smaller vehicles and fewer traffic jams. It appears to me that Chevrolet completely missed an opportunity to design and manufacture an efficient and technologically advanced vehicle suitable for traveling city streets. ROBERT J. EPSTEIN New York Dear Sir, I do wish you had commented on whether there were seat belts in the new Caprice's back seat. Lacking such comment, I'll assume such belts are not there. I commend your suggestion that the driver's seatback is not satisfactory, since this problem can surely contribute to, or even cause, long-term injury to the persons trying to make a living in this rough industry. THURMAN B. WENZL Lowell, Mass. Dear Sir, I wonder why your otherwise comprehensive article does not mention air-conditioning. All over the world, passenger comfort is foremost, so why not here? EDWARD G. NEWMAN White Plains, N.Y. Taking last things first, Chevy's new taxi package includes standard air-conditioning. It also puts seat belts in the rear. As for the car's type and size, I agree. Nothing comes close to the old Checker cab, but a short, tall van would be just the thing, particularly if it had a tough but pliant suspension and an economical and clean-burning engine. -- M. S."
1/10/1991	Debt Warning On Car Makers	"The Standard & Poor's Corporation said today that it had put the Big Three auto makers on notice that their corporate debt ratings could be lowered because of a worsening economic picture and specific problems at each company. Standard & Poor's placed the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation on its """"credit watch"""" list. Any subsequent lowering of the debt ratings would make it more difficult and more expensive for the companies to borrow money."
1/9/1991	Some Dealership Fees Are Waived by Saturn	Because of a slow production start at its Tennessee assembly plant, the General Motors Corporation's Saturn division will absorb up to $5.8 million in fees it originally charged to dealers, company officials said today. The division makes and markets a line of small cars, using a dealer network separate from other G.M. divisions.
1/8/1991	Saturn Shifts Management	Less than five months after it began producing a challenger to Japanese small cars, the General Motors Corporation's Saturn subsidiary today named a new head of manufacturing. Robert E. Boruff, 49 years old, will become vice president of manufacturing operations at Saturn, which has adopted several novel manufacturing processes in its attempt to match or exceed the Japanese in quality. Previously, Mr. Boruff had been manager of Saturn's plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. He replaces Guy D. Briggs, 52, who has been named a corporate vice president and director of operations for G.M.'s truck and bus group. Saturn, which began production in August, turned out only 4,245 cars in its first four months, a small number compared with other new auto assembly plants. Saturn officials said the slow start was necessary to insure quality. Some Saturn dealers complained of minor defects in the cars, and some also worried that the lack of cars was causing people to shop for other models. A Saturn spokesman said the slow start had no bearing on the decision to replace Mr. Briggs and said his assumption of the top job at G.M.'s truck and bus group was a promotion.
12/31/1990	American Industry Faces the Challenge of Tougher Times	"Robert C. Stempel A New Team Spirit At General Motors The selection of Robert C. Stempel as chairman of the General Motors Corporation speaks volumes about the new priorities of the world's largest auto maker. Since the 1950's, G.M.'s management had been dominated by financial executives whose bottom-line orientation took precedence over quality, market share and other concerns. The latest exemplar of that philosophy was Roger B. Smith, an accountant whose tenure as chairman ended in August. The 57-year-old Mr. Stempel has a background as an engineer and a sympathy for the importance of vehicle design and manufacture. His ascension could not come at a more opportune moment for G.M., whose vehicles usually fail to match the best Japanese cars in quality and customer surveys. With car sales down in 1990 and another weak year predicted, G.M. will have to work hard to regain some of the huge market share it lost in the 80's. Part of Mr. Stempel's job will be to put some entrepreneurial zip into G.M.'s bureaucratic corporate culture. Slowly, Mr. Stempel is trimming the bureaucracy and layers of management, giving workers greater freedom and responsibility to make their own decisions. To foster this spirit, he consciously uses the word """"we"""" more than """"I,"""" and he sprinkles his pep talks with references to the G.M. """"team."""" But there is still a way to go before the entire G.M. team is happy. The United Auto Workers union flayed the chairman publicly a week before Christmas when G.M. declined to pay its pension increases before the Internal Revenue Service issues a ruling on them in April. The union argued that the I.R.S. always gives a favorable ruling, but G.M. answered that its new union contract specified payment in April."
12/25/1990	Auto Makers Cutting Output	The Big Three auto makers plan to build 8.2 percent fewer cars and trucks in the first quarter of 1991 than they had originally projected, according to a published report. Ward's Autotmotive Reports, an industry newsletter, said G.M., Ford and Chrysler had reduced the output estimates made in December by 212,000 vehicles. The production cuts, which follow sharp declines in fourth- quarter output, would put first- quarter production about 1 percent below the first quarter of 1990, a weak period for American car and truck production. Industry analysts believe further production cuts are likely before the end of March. Last week, the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler said they would extend holiday vacations for about 41,650 workers because of big inventories and low orders. While none of the Big Three assembly plants are open this week because of the Christmas and New Year's holidays, the Ford Motor Company is the only American car maker that will not extend its shutdowns.
12/24/1990	G.M. Offices in U.S.S.R.	The General Motors Corporation will open permanent offices in Moscow and the Russian auto manufacturing city of Togliatti, the Tass press agency has reported. The auto maker received an accreditation permit to open the offices. In June G.M. announced a five-year $1 billion deal with Volga Auto Works to supply 100,000 to 150,000 engine control systems a year beginning in 1992. Volga Auto Works builds Zhiguli and Lada compact cars and the Niva, a Soviet sport-utility vehicle.
12/14/1990	New Opel Plant	The General Motors Corporation's wholly owned Opel subsidiary signed an agreement to invest $675 million in an auto plant in eastern Germany. Opel will build a plant in Eisenach to make 150,000 Corsa and Kadett models annually. It will create 2,600 new jobs, Opel said, with the first cars to come off the assembly line in late 1992. The company was hailed by the German Government for helping to develop the economically backward region.
12/13/1990	G.M. and Ford Wary on '91; Gulf Outcome Called a Key	The clouded economic outlook is forcing the nation's two biggest auto makers to hedge their bets for 1991, with sales projections trimmed and the level of dividend payments perhaps in question. A crucial issue for the economy and Detroit, top executives of General Motors and Ford agreed today in year-end news conferences, will be the outcome of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
12/12/1990	General Motors	The General Motors Corporation is planning to increase the number of dealerships owned by members of minorities by 40 percent in three years and find ways to maintain the 192 it already has, the company said. Currently, about 2 percent of G.M.'s 9,600 dealers are members of minorities. G.M. said it hoped to raise that number to 2.8 percent, or 268 dealerships, by 1993.
12/12/1990	G.M. Forms New Unit	The General Motors Corporation announced the formation today of a new G.M. Powertrain division to coordinate activities of its new Engine division and the Hydra-matic division. The move, said G.M.'s president, Lloyd Reuss, was intended to consolidate major engine and transmission operations into one operation. The G.M. Engine division was formed last year to coordinate engine research and development for all G.M. car and truck divisions. The Powertrain division will be headed by Richard Donnelly. He joined G.M. in 1961 and rose through its manufacturing and product planning operations to become general manager of the Engine division.
12/11/1990	Many Buyers, but No Saturns to Sell	The scene inside the showroom at Saturn of Schaumburg, which has been open for only six weeks, is a car dealer's nightmare: flocks of eager buyers, but no cars to sell. While assembly of the much-awaited Saturn car, a product of the General Motors Corporation, began four months ago at a new plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., manufacturing problems have limited output to just 2,162 cars -- about the number that could be produced in three days if the factory was operating at full speed.
12/11/1990	New G.M. Plan For Car Phones	The General Motors Corporation is expected to announce today that it will install mobile telephones in a much wider range of car models and that it has developed a higher capacity system for handling calls from such phones. The cost, size and complexity of cellular telephones have been reduced in the last several years, so that the phones' electronics can be easily implanted into a car's dashboard or body for several hundred dollars. General Motors currently offers cellular phones as an option only on the Cadillac Allante and charges $1,200 for a model with the electronics mounted in the trunk. This is several times the price now charged by private companies. Cellular industry experts also expect General Motors to announce today the development of techniques that could increase the capacity of cellular phone systems by 6 to 10 times. The Hughes Aircraft Company, a division of General Motors, has been working with International Mobile Machines, a small maker of cellular equipment, on ways for cellular phones to share radio frequencies by taking very short turns to transmit and receive signals. General Motors declined to comment.
11/30/1990	G.M. CUTS OUTPUT IN THE LATEST SIGN OF ECONOMIC SLUMP	The General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest industrial company, said today that it was sharply cutting back its production for the rest of the year because of the weakening American economy. The cutbacks reflect the company's pessimistic outlook for American car and truck sales, which General Motors said had been made worse by the economic uncertainty since the Persian Gulf crisis began and dwindling consumer confidence.
11/27/1990	G.M. Unit in Spain	The General Motors Corporation's Hughes Aircraft subsidiary has set up a company in Spain to supply the expanding commercial and industrial markets for electronic components in Europe. Hughes said that the move would be accompanied by expanded marketing efforts in Europe and that other new factories were being considered. Hughes Microelectronics Europa Espana S.A. will be built on nine acres of land in a new industrial park in Malaga, a seaport. By 1994, it will employ 400 workers.
11/22/1990	G.M. Recalls Cars for Defective Brake Light Switch	The General Motors Corporation is recalling more than half a million of its 1989 and 1990 midsize cars to correct a defective switch for brake lights that could lead to rear-end collisions. The recall, announced Tuesday, is sizable but not among G.M.'s largest and comes as the world's biggest automobile maker is spending heavily for advertisements asserting that its cars and trucks have substantially improved since the early 1980's.
11/16/1990	A.T.&T. Deal Is Set	The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced a plan to build the first fiber-optic link between the United States and Germany. The cable is expected to handle about 100,000 simultaneous telephone conversations between the countries, a company statement said. A.T.&T. and a German telecommunications company, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom G.m.b.H., are scheduled to complete the project in late 1992 or early 1993, an A.T.&T. spokesman, David Bikle, said. The system would allow A.T.&T. to meet a growing demand for overseas calls to Europe, he said.

The partners also will assemble a small number of Opel cars to distribute in Czechoslovakia. G.M., the world's largest auto maker, has looked to the former Eastern European bloc not only as an expanding market for its products but as a largely untapped manufacturing base. Within the last year, the auto maker has announced manufacturing projects for Hungary, the Soviet Union and eastern Germany.
11/1/1990	LOSES $1.98 BILLION	The General Motors Corporation, acknowledging that it would not soon recapture lost ground in a glutted market and wary of harder times in the industry, moved today to close up to nine factories that employ tens of thousands of workers. The closings, which will cost G.M. billions of dollars, resulted in its biggest quarterly loss ever. G.M., the nation's largest company, said it would close four assembly plants permanently and established financial provisions that made the closing of five more likely over the next three years. Because of the enormous cost of shutting down the factories and laying off workers, the company reported a loss of $1.98 billion.
10/31/1990	G.M. Sets Plan to Idle 16 Plants	Faced with wary buyers and an uncertain economy, the General Motors Corporation said today that it would cut production in the next two months, idling 16 car and truck assembly plants for up to four weeks. The move will result in the temporary layoffs of 43,500 hourly workers. The nation's largest auto maker will cut 81,000 cars, or about 10 percent of what it had planned for the fourth quarter, and 73,000 light trucks and vans, equal to about 13 percent of its planned truck production, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter.
10/30/1990	DEVICE IN AIR BAGS PROMPTS RECALLS	The Ford Motor Company and three other manufacturers are recalling more than 55,000 late model cars after the discovery that scores of air bag inflators may fail to work in a head-on crash and may also release dangerous gases.

10/30/1990	Auto Makers May Take Big Charges	Financial analysts are speculating that the nation's two largest automobile companies will announce substantial quarterly write-offs this week, cutting into their already weak earnings. The Ford Motor Company, which announces its third-quarter results on Tuesday, may announce a charge against the earnings of First Nationwide Financial Corporation, a savings and loan association acquired in 1985 for $493 million. Analysts said they expected the First Nationwide write-off might be $100 million to $200 million, possibly depressing Ford's profits. Ford officials were not immediately available for comment today. Big G.M. Charge Seen The General Motors Corporation, to announce its earnings on Wednesday, may write off $750 million or more, as a one-time charge against its third-quarter earnings to cover the costs of closing four assembly plants that were idled indefinitely during the last three years.
10/23/1990	Market Place; Are Auto Payouts Likely to Be Cut?

10/23/1990	Ex-Aide Held in G.M. Theft	The authorities arrested a former photo technician for the General Motors Corporation today on charges that he tried to get the auto maker to pay $75,000 for stolen confidential photographs of G.M. cars. Gregory Charles Hooper, 36 years old, of Royal Oak, Mich., was charged with mail fraud in a complaint filed by the United States Attorney's office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. He was released on bond. The F.B.I. began an investigation on June 16 after receiving a complaint from G.M. that some photographs of cars it was working on were appearing in magazines. Mr. Hooper reportedly tried to obtain $75,000 from G.M. for the return of the photographs, the F.B.I. said in a statement. In November 1989, G.M. offered a $30,000 reward for information relating to what the auto maker suspected was the theft of photographs from its design studio after photographs of its new Saturn car began appearing in automotive magazines. A G.M. spokesman said today the $30,000 had not been paid. Mr. Hooper faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if found guilty.

1/21/1987	G.M. Said to Study Plant Closings	LEAD: The General Motors Corporation is considering closing as many as 20 or more auto parts plants in an effort to become more competitive, The Detroit Free Press reported, quoting an anonymous source.

''The guy next to me and I looked at each other and we said the same thing: 'They're not going to sell.' ''
12/26/1986	G.M. Sent Perot Packing But Paid for His Silence	For H. Ross Perot, the scrappy Texas billionaire who founded the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, the year was full of new and resurrected crusades. Frustrated by the bureaucratic weight of the General Motors Corporation, which acquired E.D.S. in 1984, Mr. Perot bristled as his goal of intrepidly revolutionizing the auto industry bogged down.
12/22/1986	G.M.'S PRODUCTION CUTS LEAVE ANALYSTS WARY	The General Motors Corporation's apparent determination to cut production to meet its sagging sales rate may entail as much danger for its current and future profitability as the sales incentives the company has renounced, auto analysts contend. G. M. said last week that it would temporarily close eight plants and lay off 24,200 workers to cut output in an effort to bring its inventories more in line with sales. The cutbacks came on top of earlier moves to trim production in the face of declining sales. But analysts said late last week that the company's share of the American car market has fallen so low in the wake of the 2.9 percent financing campaign of last fall, that G. M. is in danger of falling below its break-even point if it actually attempts to match production to sales. 33% Share Not Enough ''G. M. is out there with a 33 percent share of the North American market,'' said Douglas K. Laughlin, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''They can't make break-even producing at a 33 percent rate.''
12/22/1986	One Big G.M. Holder Is Not Publicity-Shy	In the past, institutional investors operated out of the glare of the public spotlight, but now managers of pension funds and other holders of huge blocks of stock are seeking public attention as they challenge corporate actions. The Wisconsin Investment Board, for example, filed a shareholders' resolution late last week with the General Motors Corporation, condemning G.M.'s $700 million buyout of the shares held by the Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot. Patricia Lipton, executive assistant to the board, directs its new Active Investor Program, which filed the resolution. ''This is the first proxy season we've really been active,'' she said.
12/21/1986	AUTO INDUSTRY ADJUSTING TO A PAINFUL NEW REALITY	GENERAL MOTORS produced another batch of bad news last week. Beset by slumping sales and determined not to return to the generous incentives that led to a whopping third-quarter loss, the automotive giant will temporarily cut production by as much as a third, idling more than 30,000 workers. In addition, 11 facilities employing 29,000 workers will close permanently, starting next year. Although the critics of the closings ranged from labor leaders to H. Ross Perot, the recently ousted member of G.M.'s board, it was widely recognized that most of the plants were obsolete and due for replacement. Most auto industry analysts, and company officials themselves, predicted that this would be only the first and least painful round of shutdowns as G.M. adjusts to the new realities of the American car market.
12/21/1986	HUMBLED G.M.	To the Editor: Smith is in the consumer products business and to be successful in that business he must produce products people want to buy. As a recruiter with recent assignments in the automotive world, I interviewed at least 15 General Motors automobile designers over the past two years.
12/21/1986	Humbled G.M.	To the Editor: Missing from ''Advice for Detroit's Humbled Giant'' (Dec. 7) is an interview with a consumer. Permit me to fill that gap.
12/18/1986	G.M. PLANS TEMPORARY OUTPUT CUT	The General Motors Corporation announced plans today to cut production, saying it would furlough 26,400 workers in January, most of them for two weeks. Nine of G.M.'s 30 car and truck assembly plants are to be closed temporarily, a company spokesman said, besides two plants previously closed for installation of paint equipment. Including those two plants, the temporary layoffs will total 30,200 workers. General Motors also has 24,000 workers on indefinite layoff.
12/18/1986	PENSION FUNDS IRKED AT G.M.	In a session with managers of major pension funds, top executives of the General Motors Corporation and H. Ross Perot disagreed today about circumstances surrounding the $700 million buyout of Mr. Perot's G.M. stock and his ouster from the G.M. board. Several of the fund managers were very critical of the presentation by the four G.M. executives. Also they apparently were irritated by the refusal of Roger B. Smith, the auto maker's chairman, to appear before a panel examining the buyout after he had agreed to do so. The Council of Institutional Investors, which represents municipal, state and union pension funds with assets totaling more than $150 billion, had asked both Mr. Smith and Mr. Perot to explain the issues in the buyout and Mr. Perot's resignation.
12/17/1986	Market Place; Doubts Linger On E.D.S. Role	EVER since Dec. 1, when the General Motors Corporation paid H. Ross Perot $700 million to buy out his holdings in the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, relations between the automotive giant and its E.D.S. subsidiary have posed a mystery to the investment community. The buyout followed Mr. Perot's mounting criticism of Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. Yesterday, at the Hotel Parker Meridien in Manhattan, officials of E.D.S. and G.M. sought, in their own words, ''to clear the air.'' Their audience consisted of nearly 100 securities analysts and a handful of money managers - some of whom have watched with dismay the falling price of E.D.S. stock. The presentation, by Les Alberthal, recently named chief executive of E.D.S., was followed by a spirited question-and-answer period.
12/16/1986	The Divestiture Con Game	Industrial giants announcing with great fanfare that they are leaving South Africa seem to be trying to pull the wool over the public's eyes. Take the front-page news that General Motors, the International Business Machines Corporation and General Electric are selling their South African operations. Those companies now virtually admit that their announced departures are little more than a subterfuge to enable them to escape economic sanctions in the United States.
12/15/1986	Perot Decision On G.M. Due	H. Ross Perot will face a decision on Monday on what to do with the approximately $700 million the General Motors Corporation paid him for his G.M. stock. When Mr. Perot accepted the buyout from G.M. on Dec. 1, he said the proceeds would be placed in escrow to allow shareholders time to seek to reverse the decision by the company's board of directors.
12/14/1986	G.M. Replacing Faulty Tires On 25,000 Cars and Trucks	The General Motors Corporation says improper alignment on about 25,000 1985 and early 1986 model cars and light trucks has prompted it to replace all-season radial tires that wore prematurely on the vehicles. ''These tires are more sensitive than other tires to misalignment conditions, primarily on the nondrive axle,'' David Hudgens, a spokesman for General Motors, said Friday.
12/14/1986	Regal Is Going Out In A Grand Manner	THE old-fashioned American hot rod is not dead. Not quite. Not yet. Come September, General Motors will discontinue its rear-wheel-drive Buick Regal, but the division plans to go out in style with what one executive described as ''a killer car.''
12/9/1986	Adversaries Break Bread in Detroit	H. Ross Perot, left, chairman of Electronic Data Services, who has resigned from G.M.'s board, lunching with Roger B. Smith, chairman of G.M. yesterday at the Economic Club of Detroit. Page D5. (NYT/Peter Yates)
12/9/1986	AMIABLE PEROT AND SMITH DISCUSS SPLIT AT G.M.	The General Motors Corporation made its offer to buy back the stock of H. Ross Perot after Mr. Perot hinted that he would vote against executive bonuses and threatened to provoke a confrontation on the G.M. board of directors over the management of his company, the Electronic Data Services Corporation, Mr. Perot said today. Mr. Perot, who accepted $700 million from General Motors in return for his stock and resignation last week, said he objected to G.M's failure to reach agreement on the pricing of services E.D.S. provides for its corporate parent and for G.M.'s insistence on conducting audits of E.D.S. Nevertheless, both Mr. Perot and Roger B. Smith, the chairman of General Motors, had only warm words for each other today as they sat side by side at lunch at the Economic Club of Detroit. This harmonious mood also prevailed at a Perot news conference before the meeting and in informal interviews with Mr. Smith both before and after the meeting. Mr. Perot, the featured speaker at the Economic Club gathering, was introduced by Mr. Smith as a ''triumphant entrepreneur in the best American tradition.'' In his speech, Mr. Perot discussed the decline of industrial companies in the United States and the need to improve quality and productivity. He did not mention General Motors by name in his speech, but many of his criticisms echoed past comments about G.M.
12/7/1986	Advice for Detroit's Humbled Giant	The case study method of teaching business requires students to study a corporation and suggest ways to solve its problems. This article takes the same approach, but with a twist: The subject is General Motors, and the ''students'' are auto analysts, dealers, consumer activists and former industry insiders with ideas on how the troubled carmaker can regain its luster. The interviews were conducted by Robert A. Bennett and Mr. Holusha. The General Motors Corporation silenced its most bitter internal critic last week when it paid H. Ross Perot more than $700 million for his G.M. stock and a promise that he would not try to take over the company or criticize its actions. But G.M.'s underlying problems will not disappear so easily. The company's chairman, Roger B. Smith, who engineered Mr. Perot's departure, is facing big troubles at the nation's No. 1 auto maker.
12/7/1986	Cast Out by G.M., Perot Still Has A Word to Say	It would make a great movie: Brash billionaire meets corporate giant and shakes up staid boardrooms with a clarion call to ''get competitive.'' But Hollywood might want to change the ending. Last week the giant, General Motors Corporation, got rid of the billionaire, H. Ross Perot, and three of his associates. The company paid them $750 million, double the market value of their stock, at a time of slumping sales and production, plant closings, layoffs and deep cuts in capital spending.
12/6/1986	G.M.-HUGHES: A SMOOTH FIT	When the General Motors Corporation paid $5.2 billion for the Hughes Aircraft Company a year and a half ago, Roger Smith, the chairman of G.M., said that Hughes's wizardry in electronics would lead to ''redefining the basic car or truck.'' It may be too soon for the Hughes-defined vehicle of the future to be rolling off G.M.'s assembly lines, but the company founded by Howard Hughes 54 years ago has settled under the wing of its new parent much more smoothly than G.M.'s other major acquisition of last year, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation. H. Ross Perot, the founder of E.D.S., was ousted from G.M.'s board this week after openly criticizing G.M.'s progress in streamlining itself and improving its products. G.M. also bought out his stake in the company for $700 million, a move that brought even more allegations of mismanagement from Mr. Perot. Hughes's Chairman's Views By contrast, Hughes appears relatively docile. ''Our relationship with G.M. has gotten off to a good start,'' said Allen E. Puckett, the chairman and chief executive of Hughes Aircraft, in an interview this week. ''I'm not about to tell Roger Smith what's wrong with G.M.''
12/6/1986	G.M. Unit Plant Is Put up For Sale	The General Motors Corporation's Fisher Guide division is putting its 2,080-worker component plant in Elyria, Ohio, up for sale to buyers who would continue running the operation, the company said. ''A successful sale to an operating buyer will keep an important manufacturing operation and corresponding employment base here in the Elyria community,'' said Rudolph Schlais Jr., a Fisher Guide product manager.
12/5/1986	2 Auto Dealer Groups Choose Their Agencies	Two New York-based ad agencies, David Deutsch Associates and Laurence, Charles, Free & Lawson, have picked up motor vehicle dealer advertising associations as clients. For the Deutsch demons, who won a three-way competition, it is the New York-New Jersey GMC Truck Dealer Association, which will spend about $1.3 million promoting sales at some 30 dealers.
12/4/1986	G.M. to Lay Off 4,500 Employees	The General Motors Corporation said it would lay off about 4,500 employees in Michigan and Missouri early next year and reduce production at three assembly plants to avoid offering incentive financing.
12/3/1986	Atwood to Confront G.M. Cultural Rifts	Donald J. Atwood, a low-key, soft-spoken executive with a grasp of technology, finance and sales, now has a high-profile assignment at the General Motors Corporation that will tax all of his areas of expertise. The executive has been given the task of guiding the company's diverse high-tech operations, including the Electronic Data Systems Corporation. One of the problems that led to the resignation on Monday of H. Ross Perot, founder of E.D.S., was the clash of corporate cultures between the entrepreneurial E.D.S. and the traditionally structured G.M. Now it will be up to the 62-year-old Mr. Atwood to try to get those operations working smoothly as well as to integrate G.M.'s other technology-related pursuits. The G.M. executive vice president and director has been put in charge of an important new business unit that will encompass E.D.S., the Hughes Aircraft Company, Delco Electronics and G.M.'s defense operations.
12/3/1986	G.M.'S BRIEF FLING WITH PEROT	When Roger B. Smith announced that the General Motors Corporation would buy the Electronic Data Systems Corporation in 1984, he made it clear that he wanted to acquire H. Ross Perot's entrepreneurial spirit as well as the assets of the company. Mr. Smith, easily the most maverick chairman in G.M.'s long history, seemed to sense a kindred soul who could understand the vision he harbored for transforming the staid industrial giant. Mr. Smith said he wanted G.M. to become more like E.D.S., rather than overshadowing the lean, results-oriented computer systems company with its vast size. In fact, Mr. Smith said in a light moment, Mr. Perot had his personal permission to shoot anyone from G.M. who showed up at E.D.S. headquarters with a G.M. procedures manual.
12/3/1986	COURT FAULTS E.P.A. ON RATING FUEL EFFICIENCY	A Federal appeals court panel held today that the Environmental Protection Agency erred when it revised its formula for measuring fuel efficiency in a way proposed by the nation's two largest car makers. The court ordered the agency to make adjustments in the fuel efficiency ratings that could cost the car makers about $300 million. The decision was by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It was ruling on one of six separate legal actions that have been filed against the Reagan Administration by groups challenging efforts to weaken Federally mandated fuel economy standards for automobiles.
12/2/1986	SHOWDOWN AT GENERAL MOTORS	Few executives have been longer on vision and more plagued by reality in recent years than Roger B. Smith, the embattled chairman of the General Motors Corporation. Mr. Smith, who is 61 years old, has established advanced technology as the auto giant's weapon of choice in its quest for world dominance of its traditional business and as the key to building a more diversified G.M. by the turn of the century. There is little that he has not attempted in trying to make his vision work since taking over as chairman in 1981, including major acquisitions, venture capital investments in artificial intelligence companies, innovative internal investment programs, management shake-ups and public advocacy. Little to Show for Efforts Mr. Smith so far has little to show for his efforts, but as demonstrated by the outcome of the battle to oust H. Ross Perot, his chief internal critic, from leadership of the company's Electronic Data Systems Corporation, he still has at least one eye on a high-tech future. In announcing Mr. Perot's departure, G.M. said yesterday that it would knit its technology-intensive military and electronics businesses into a new unit. It is, Mr. Smith said, ''a logical step as we continue to devote our energies and resources to achieving worldwide technological leadership.''
12/2/1986	Roger Smith's Active Tenure	Jan. 1, 1981 - Roger B. Smith takes office as chairman and chief executive officer of General Motors. Aug. 12 - G.M. buys 5.3 percent of Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan. March 25, 1982 - G.M. forms GMF Robotics, a 50-50 venture between General Motors and Fanuc of Japan that will develop and produce robots in the United States. Feb. 14, 1983 - G.M. plans a venture with Toyota. The company was named New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., and given the job of building compact cars of Toyota design under the Chevrolet nameplate at Fremont, Calif.
12/2/1986	Market Place; G.M.'S E STOCK: ANALYSTS WARY	THE class E stock of the General Motors Corporation has often shown wide price swings - it rose 93 percent in 1985 - but its sharp decline yesterday reflected an executive suite conflict at the world's largest automotive company. The E shares, actually comprising a class of G.M. common stock, were issued to pay for part of G.M.'s $2.5 billion acquisition of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation in October 1984. Yesterday, the E stock plunged 4 1/2 points to close at 26 7/8, on the news that H. Ross Perot, the billionaire founder and chairman of E.D.S., had resigned after an escalating feud with Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. ''Ross Perot is the champion of E.D.S. and shareholders of the class E stock,'' said Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch. ''His departure put a cloud over the stock. I have been cautious on the E stock since August. I maintain a high degree of caution, since too many unknowns still exist.''
12/2/1986	PESKY ENTREPRENEUR: HENRY ROSS PEROT	He has never been able to keep quiet. Perhaps that should have warned everyone that the maverick and the auto giant were not going to make it together. Even yesterday, as General Motors announced that H. Ross Perot was leaving its board and selling back his G.M. stock, Mr. Perot stole the show from the auto maker with his own news conference in Dallas, where he twitted G.M. for paying him such an outlandish amount of money when workers were being laid off. Ross Perot, 5 feet 6 inches tall, has long been the pint-sized billionaire with the Texas-sized mouth. He calls himself an irritant. ''I stir things up,'' he likes to say.
12/2/1986	PEROT IS REMOVED FROM G.M. BOARD, BUT HAS BIG PROFIT	H. Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who was the largest stockholder in the General Motors Corporation, was ousted from G.M.'s board of directors today after months of bickering with top executives of the world's largest auto maker. As part of his agreement to resign, Mr. Perot will sell back his stock to G.M. for $700 million, more than twice its market value, giving him a profit of about $350 million. Mr. Perot, joined the auto maker's board when he sold his computer systems company, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, to G.M. a little more than two years ago. The agreement with General Motors came just before Mr. Perot became the focus of a different kind of publicity; it was revealed that he had been involved in efforts to free American hostages in the Middle East. Hopes for Reversal Mr. Perot apparently believes there is some possibility that the General Motors action could be reversed. He said he would place the $700 million from the stock sale in escrow for two weeks, until Dec. 15, to allow the board to ''review'' the matter. He said he hesitated to accept the deal so soon after G.M. announced plant layoffs and other cutbacks. He offered to ''work with the G.M. directors to rescind this decision,'' but added that he would take no action to bring about his reinstatement.
12/2/1986	E.D.S.'S PROSPECTS IN THE AFTERMATH	When the General Motors Corporation purchased the Electronic Data Systems Corporation two years ago for $2.5 billion, it gave E.D.S. perhaps the most challenging project ever to face a computer company: unify G.M.'s huge but badly fragmented data-processing operations, from the showroom floor to the design laboratories to a sprawling network of auto-parts suppliers. Now, just as that effort to streamline and stitch begins to take shape, E.D.S. is losing its strong-willed founder and its charmed role as a distinct entity in the G.M. empire with a direct pipeline to the board room. The question, already being asked in the company's hallways and on Wall Street yesterday, was: Would E.D.S. still be able to fulfill its mission, or would it be swallowed up by the bureaucracy it was supposed to tame? The Talent Problem ''There's a chance, a good chance,'' said one former E.D.S. executive yesterday, ''that General Motors will have spent billions of dollars for some talent that's going to seek employment someplace else.''
11/30/1986	The Mid-80's Parable of the Toys and Cars	To the Editor: Until quite recently, I worked in the General Motors Building. Towering over the Plaza, Central Park and standing between Fifth and Madison Avenues, it was a world-class building.
11/28/1986	G.M. CHIEF RETURNS FIRE IN SKIRMISH WITH PEROT	The war of words between the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, Roger B. Smith, and the company's biggest stockholder, H. Ross Perot, appears to be escalating, with Mr. Smith trying to seize the initiative. All of this comes within days of the disclosure by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company that it had discussed with G.M. the sale of at least part of G.M.'s Electronic Data Systems subsidiary. Mr. Perot, the chairman of E.D.S. and the holder of eight-tenths of 1 percent of G.M. stock, has been publicly critical of G.M.'s management style, calling it overly bureaucratic and isolated from both factory floors and customer tastes. He has sniped at executive perquisites such as chauffeur-driven cars, special dining rooms and the 14th floor of the G.M. building, where the company's top managers work behind two sets of locked and guarded doors.
11/27/1986	Pontiac Fiero Cuts Cause 600 Layoffs	The General Motors Corporation will cut production on its Pontiac Fiero models and lay off 600 workers next year to avert the need for financing sales incentives on the sporty cars, G.M. officials said.
11/26/1986	G.M. Layoffs Continue Because of Lack of Parts	More than 58,700 General Motors Corporation workers were told to stay home today because of mounting assembly plant layoffs. A strike by 7,700 workers at the Delco Electronics plant in Kokomo, Ind., ended Saturday, but it caused a parts shortage that is likely to last until early December, said John Mueller, a spokesman for the automobile maker. Counting today's layoffs, about 70,000 nonstriking workers have been idled at one time or another because of the Delco strike.
11/25/1986	G.M.-E.D.S. STRAINS INDICATED	A report that the General Motors Corporation unsuccessfully discussed selling all or part of its Electronic Data Systems unit to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company appears to indicate how difficult the process of combining E.D.S. and G.M. has been. The report, in today's issue of The Wall Street Journal, also shows how serious the strains between Roger B. Smith, the G.M. chairman, and H. Ross Perot, the E.D.S. chairman, have become. When G.M. announced that it was buying E.D.S. two and a half years ago, it said the intention was ''to join together in order to create the largest and most technologically advanced computer services company in the world.'' However, A.T.&T. executives confirmed today that they had conducted talks including ''a wide range of options'' with E.D.S. ''that did not preclude investment.'' But spokesmen for E.D.S. and G.M. declined to discuss the situation, with G.M. saying only: ''E.D.S. is not for sale. There are no discussions going on concerning such an action.''
11/25/1986	Despite U.A.W. Settlement, Some G.M. Workers Are Idle	Assembly line workers today resumed production at General Motors Corporation's Delco Electronics plant after a six-day strike, but a parts shortage kept 15 other plants closed, idling more than 47,000 workers, the company said.
11/23/1986	AUTO WORKERS APPROVE PACT	Delco workers whose strike at a key plant idled more than 37,000 General Motors employees nationwide overwhelmingly approved a new contract today, a union offical said. With about 3,000 votes cast, 99 percent of the striking Delco Electronics plant workers approved the new contract, according to Mike Thayer, shop chairman of Local 292 of the United Automobile Workers.
11/23/1986	About Cars; Appeal Still Great For Monte Carlos	FOR '87, shoppers are going to find a narrower choice in the showrooms, but the gaps will not be widely apparent. While 32 of last year's models have disappeared, 289 variations remain, and they span a greater range than ever. Automotive News, the industry publication that each year computes the subtractions and additions, notes that the biggest proliferation of nameplates occurred in 1970, when buyers could boggle themselves with 375 possible picks. This year, though, there is every sort of drivetrain and configuration, everything from front-drive coupes to all-wheel-drive wagons and utility vehicles. Packages big and little. Convertibles. Snarling V-8's and gas-sipping 4's. There are new cars, such as Cadillac's Allante and the Chrysler-Maserati roadster. And there are, happily, some familiar faces.
11/22/1986	Ford Offers New Incentives	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would offer low-interest financing or a $300 rebate on 1986 and 1987 Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx models in response to a similar offer announced earlier by the Chrysler Corporation. ''This incentive is designed to maintain our strong sales momentum and protect our market share,'' said Louis Lataif, Ford vice president.
11/21/1986	LAYOFFS AT G.M. IN DELCO STRIKE	The General Motors Corporation laid off 33,350 people in seven states today because of a strike at a Delco Electronics plant that might soon force the nation's largest automobile maker to close most of its assembly facilities. Negotiators returned to the bargaining table, meanwhile, in hopes of ending the walkout by 7,700 people at the Delco plant in Kokomo, Ind., which produces critical parts for G.M. ''If the strike goes - well, not even too much longer - we will be completely shut down,'' G.M.'s chairman, Roger Smith, said late Wednesday. General Motors laid off workers until further notice in Delaware, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey and Ohio because of parts shortages caused by the Delco walkout, a G.M. spokesman, John Mueller, said. About 16,700 of the workers were told not to report starting today and the rest were told not to report starting Friday, Mr. Mueller said.
11/21/1986	Ratings Revised For Auto Makers	Duff & Phelps Inc., a Chicago-based rating service, has lowered debt ratings of the General Motors Corporation and its finance subsidiary, while raising ratings of the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and their finance subsidiaries. Ratings for G.M. and its subsidaries were reduced to D.&P.-4 from D.&P.-3, the equivalent of a drop to AA- from AA.
11/20/1986	ELECTRONICS STRIKE IDLES 16,700 G.M. WORKERS	About 16,700 General Motors workers at plants in three states were notified today that they were being laid off effective Thursday because of a strike at the Delco Electronics plant in Kokomo, Ind., a G.M. spokesman said. The General Motors plants in Michigan, Kentucky and Missouri were left without essential automobile parts after 7,700 workers at the Delco plant walked off their jobs Monday in a dispute over subcontracting of some jobs and the planned transfer of some production to Mexico. The General Motors spokesman said some employees only worked partial shifts today.
11/20/1986	Biederman to Handle Syncsort and Cadillac	Two bits of news come from Biederman & Company. First, some new business: This concerns Syncsort, a computer programming company that generally creates software for the IBM mainframe.
11/19/1986	STRIKE AT G.M. FACTORY IN SOUTH AFRICA COLLAPSES	A three-week strike at General Motors collapsed today as workers streamed back after an ultimatum to return or be dismissed. The company said just 219 strikers failed to come back by the 9 A.M. deadline that the automaker announced Monday. He said those who failed to return thereby ''dismissed themselves.''
11/18/1986	SATURN'S MAKERS PLANS SLOW BUILDUP OF SALES	Saturn Corporation cars will probably be sold only in California and other areas with high import penetration when they are first introduced in the early 1990's, officials of the General Motors Corporation subsidiary said today. Saturn officials also said they still expected the first Saturn model to roll off the assembly line here by mid-1990, but they said cars would not be available in volume until the following year because of a planned slow increase in the production rate. With the cars in short supply at first, they will probably be concentrated in a few areas rather than spread thinly across the country.
11/18/1986	G.M. and Ford To Cut Output	The nation's two largest auto makers said today that they would cut fourth-quarter production from earlier estimates. The General Motors Corporation attributed its cutbacks to slack demand following the end of bargain-basement financing deals on new cars.
11/18/1986	PRETORIA POLICE DISPERSE G.M. STRIKERS	South African policemen used dogs and whips today to break up a gathering of striking workers at the General Motors plant in Port Elizabeth, witnesses said. General Motors said it called in the police after workers, striking in protest at details of the American company's plan to sell out to local buyers, intimidated fellow workers into staying away from the plant. The strike started on Oct. 29 to back demands for union representation on the board of the local company to be formed as General Motors' successor and for severance pay when the company changes hands.
11/14/1986	CORRECTION	A table in Business Day last Saturday with an article about the historic domination of the car market by General Motors misstated the size of Ford Motor's staff, using information supplied by that company. In 1980, Ford's salaried work force in the United States totaled 76,000, and in 1985 it was 69,000.
11/12/1986	G.M. to Recall 89,000 Cars	The General Motors Corporation said Monday that it was recalling about 89,000 Buick and Oldsmobile models for inspection of a power steering hose that could leak and cause an engine compartment fire. The company said it was not aware of any injuries or accidents stemming from the improperly placed hose on its 1986 models. Owners of the Buick Electra and the Park Avenue and the Oldsmobile 98 models were asked to take them to dealers for a free inspection.
11/12/1986	G.M.'S JOBLESS NET: HOW SAFE?	When General Motors announced last week that it would close 11 plants employing 29,000 workers, many labor experts predicted that the innovations in the auto workers' contract might make their fate different from that of most jobless factory workers. Protections contained in the United Automobile Workers' pact with G.M. include transfer rights for openings at other G.M. plants, supplementary unemployment benefits, a guaranteed income stream for many of the jobless workers and a $1 billion job opportunity bank. Notwithstanding these provisions, workers at the affected plants in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio were worried that these benefits were better in theory than in practice. While some of these workers would have the right to fill openings G.M. may have elsewhere, for example, some doubted that there would be room for everyone, particularly since G.M. has said that other plant closings are likely to follow. Some workers speculated that less than one-sixth of the 29,000 affected G.M. employees would receive transfer offers in the next two years.
11/11/1986	South African Strikers Seek to Return	Hundreds of black workers on strike for the past 12 days trooped to the front of two General Motors plants in Port Elizabeth today, but the gates remained locked. Officials of the South African subsidiary of the American auto company met with shop stewards, who said most of the 2,000 strikers wanted to return but approval was needed from the National Automobile and Allied Workers Union.
11/10/1986	G.M.'S CUTS REFLECT A LONG-TERM TREND	When the General Motors Corporation said last week that it would close 11 plants, affecting 29,000 workers, industry analysts noted that the world's largest auto company had plenty of worries, such as high per-car production costs and declining consumer enthusiasm for its products. However, none denied G.M.'s contention that its move also reflected forces affecting all American manufacturers. Global competition; pressure to remodel industry into smaller, more flexible units, and modern manufacturing technology have all eaten away at industry's need for workers. According to business executives, labor experts and consultants, these forces are likely to eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs in the domestic auto industry in the next few years and millions more in other industrial enterprises.
11/9/1986	IN QUOTES	''They expect us to go back in there tomorrow and keep up the party.'' Edmund Siniarski, a worker at G.M.'s Fleetwood Assembly plant in Detroit, after the company announced plans to close 11 plants and lay off about 29,000 employees.
11/9/1986	A Painful Round of Cuts for G.M.	G.M. is shutting 11 plants in the United States and laying off many of the 29,000 workers at those plants. The move was not unexpected, though the magnitude surprised some analysts, and the company hopes the shutdowns will help it to regain a competitive edge in the auto market. The 11 plants account for 10 percent of G.M. production vehicles in North America, but the chairman of G.M., Roger B. Smith, said the remaining plants will become more efficient as its $10 billion modernization plan proceeds. Analysts said the moves should result in a stronger G.M., but warn that G.M. still must make cars that are attractive to consumers, rather than rely on incentive plans to attract buyers. The auto industry in the United States has been battered in recent years by the wave of imports. At first, American auto makers began producing cars overseas, where costs are lower, but their attentions are now turning back home. But while G.M.'s cutbacks may help the industry, they are a setback for the United Automobile Workers, which has been fighting for job security, and for parts of the country that are still heavily dependent on autos.
11/9/1986	G.M. to Close 11 Plants That Employ 29,000	The General Motors Corporation has been making too many cars with too many workers in too many obsolete factories, according to industry analysts, and it reported a third-quarter operating loss of $338.5 million. Last week the giant automaker said that over the next three years it would close 11 plants employing 29,000 people. And the company's president, F. James McDonald, added, ''I wouldn't say this is the end of the plant closings'' in a $10-billion modernization program.
11/8/1986	CORRECTIONS	A front-page article yesterday about plant closings announced by the General Motors Corporation misstated G.M.'s stock action Thursday. It rose $1 a share, to $74.25.
11/8/1986	IN FLINT, A VERY PERSONAL BLOW	Ever since a local carriage maker decided to get into the automobile business here 80 years ago, this factory town north of Detroit has risen and fallen with the fortunes of the General Motors Corporation. It is here on the banks of the Flint River that Billy Durant, the carriage maker and the company's prime mover, brought the Buick Motor Company, invited Charles Stewart Mott, a New York axle maker, to join him, and created what would become the largest manufacturing company in the world. The town of 150,000 people grew with the G.M. production count, flipped into a recession during the lean years earlier this decade and rebounded during the reprieve that began in 1983. G.M. remains the town's largest single employer, so the announcement Thursday that the auto maker would close two of its enormous Flint plants and lay off 7,000 workers here by the end of next year was seen as both an economic blow and a personal affront to the company's birthplace.
11/8/1986	G.M.'S OBSESSION WITH SIZE	''I have always believed in planning big, and I have always discovered after the fact that, if anything, we didn't plan big enough.'' Alfred P. Sloan Jr., ''My Years With General Motors.'' No company anywhere has celebrated the virtues of sheer bigness more than the General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker. It was a philosophy shaped and spelled out by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the company's legendary chairman, who fashioned a loose confederation of struggling car ventures into America's largest industrial enterprise - one that supplied a car for every taste and pocketbook. By 1962, General Motors made one out of every two cars sold in America.
11/7/1986	U.A.W. IS SET BACK OVER JOB SECURITY	Leaders of the United Automobile Workers acknowledged today that their efforts to assure job security for their members had been dealt a blow by the General Motors Corporation's decision to shut several plants. ''This is definitely a setback, and we will not try to sugarcoat that,'' said Peter Laarman, a union spokesman. Union officials emphasized, however, that they had been thoroughly briefed about the plant closings by management officials and were generally satisfied that every effort had been made by the company to ease its impact on workers. ''The early notice involved in this shows that we're working on this problem together,'' said Donald F. Ephlin, the union's vice president for G.M. The union leaders also said that the job losses would not be as severe as they would have been had they occurred before the union won job-security concessions in recent contracts.
11/7/1986	29,000 WORKERS WILL BE AFFECTED	In a sweeping move to cut costs and regain its competitive edge, the General Motors Corporation announced yesterday that it would close 11 plants in the United States that employ about 29,000 people, or more than 5 percent of its work force in this country. Calling the shutdowns ''the first phase'' of a reorganization and modernization program, G.M. officials said at a news conference in Detroit that they were also studying the possible closing of other assembly, stamping, engine and component facilities. ''I wouldn't say this is the end of the plant closings,'' said F. James McDonald, the company's president. Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman, said the shutdowns were part of G.M.'s $10 billion program to replace obsolete facilities with modern, efficient plants. By making the company more competitive, he added, these moves would improve its ability to maintain market leadership and enhance the job security of its remaining work force.
11/7/1986	Relief at Plants In Northeast	Officials of the General Motors Corporation in the Northeast expressed relief that their plants were not affected by yesterday's announcement of closings and layoffs. But they said they lacked confidence that their operations would not someday join the ranks of those to be closed.
11/7/1986	G.M. Closings Surprise Perot	Ross Perot, the head of the General Motors Corporation's Electronic Data Systems subsidiary and the auto maker's largest individual stockholder, said yesterday that he was ''surprised'' at the number of plant closings announced yesterday. Mr. Perot, in a telephone interview from his Dallas headquarters, said he learned of the move at last Monday's directors' meeting.
11/7/1986	BLOW TO MICHIGAN'S RECOVERY	The closing of seven General Motors Corporation plants in Michigan and the impending layoff of thousands of auto workers may severely set back the state's economic recovery, economists and officials here said today. Industry analysts, however, hailed the action as an inevitable part of the giant auto maker's retrenchment efforts and a potentially positive step for the company in the long run. Indeed, some said the auto maker would have to cut back even further to remain competitive. For now, nearly 15,000 auto workers in cities across the southeastern part of the state will lose their jobs by the end of next year, the auto maker said, and city and state officials were trying to figure out how they would make up for the loss. G.M.'s plans may also weaken related industries clustered in the same region. Largest Employer in Flint In Flint, 60 miles north of Detroit, where G.M. is the largest single employer, more than 7,000 people - just over one of every 10 G.M. workers -will be laid off.
11/4/1986	G.M. SALE: AMERICAN HEADS UNIT	The General Motors Corporation, which has announced plans to disengage from this divided land, said today that an American chief executive would continue to run its South African subsidiary after it is sold to its local management this year. One of the local buyers of the company indicated at a news conference that the new ownership would ''not preclude'' sales to the military and police, forbidden under American law while G.M. still owns the company. Meanwhile, an industrial dispute at the company's Port Elizabeth plant remained unresolved. General Motors, which had set a deadline for 2,400 striking workers to return to their jobs, said it had extended the deadline until Tuesday before deciding whether to dismiss them for what it considers an illegal strike.
10/31/1986	G.M. Cuts Estimates for Saturn Output and Jobs	The General Motors Corporation conceded today that its Saturn plant in Tennessee would fall well below predicted production and employment levels when it goes into operation in the summer of 1990. Roger B. Smith, the chairman of G. M., had predicted in January 1985 that the plant would produce 500,000 cars a year and employ 6,000 workers in its first full year of operation. But today, Richard G. LeFauve, the president of Saturn, said production would only be about 200,000 to 250,000 cars a year until the public reception for the new model could be gauged, and that employment would be about 3,000 workers.
10/30/1986	Why G.M. Decided To Quit South Africa	Of all the troubled places in the world, South Africa is probably the saddest because of missed opportunities. Chief among these has been the opportunity to bring all of the South African people into the economic and political mainstream of one of the richest and most promising countries on the continent. General Motors has been in South Africa for 60 years, and we believe we played a positive role in the attempt to realize that opportunity. We believe our efforts to promote social progress and racial equality justified our being there. But several problems have now converged that make our presence in South Africa no longer possible.
10/30/1986	G.M. WORKERS IN SOUTH AFRICA GO OUT ON STRIKE	Employees of the General Motors Corporation in South Africa went on strike today, seeking a greater say in company affairs once the unit is sold to South African interests. The strike was called by the National Automobile and Allied Workers Union, which represents 1,600 of G.M.'s 3,000 workers in South Africa. The strike was joined by members of the Motor Assembly and Component Workers of South Africa, effectively shutting down G.M.'s production in the coastal city of Port Elizabeth.

10/27/1986	G.M. May Scale Back Its Saturn Corp. Plans	The General Motors Corporation is scaling back plans for its highly touted Saturn Corporation, according to a report today in the Detroit News. According to the newspaper, which relied mainly on unnamed sources, G.M. will produce only 200,000 cars a year once production begins sometime in the 1990's, well below the 500,000-a-year level announced in the original Saturn plan. In a telephone interview today, Jerome P. Bishop, a spokesman for the company, said top G.M. officials had publicly stated that the Saturn manufacturing complex being built in Spring Hill, Tenn., would operate at less than full production while the Saturn brand is being introduced.
10/26/1986	LEAVING SOUTH AFRICA INCREASINGLY ALONE WITH ITS TROUBLES	THE advertisements on the state radio seem designed to reassure and register, perhaps, a little defiance. Sanctions or no sanctions, one says, South African Airways will get you to the United States. Along Johannesburg streets, newspaper billboards reflect the same news of economic punishment. ''Disinvestment: more to follow?'' was a headline in Business Day, a financial newspaper. Long anticipated in view of the Government's reluctance to satisfy foreign demands for change, disinvestment by prominent companies came to South Africa last week with the announced withdrawal of General Motors and I.B.M. Coca-Cola had already shed its holding. Honeywell was reportedly contemplating similar action. The indicators suggest a nation under siege. And, to an increasingly visible extent, the besiegers are Americans, for reasons blending some indignation with much expediency, far ahead of their Western allies in punishing a land that the Reagan Administration seeks to coax, rather than bludgeon, toward racial and political change.
10/26/1986	DID 2 AMERICAN COMPANIES MEET DIVESTMENT TEST?	The decisions by the General Motors Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation to sell their South African subsidiaries have created a quandary. The question is whether the actions will satisfy the dozens of cities, states, universities, pension funds and portfolio managers that have been pressing American companies to get out of South Africa. They must decide whether G.M. and I.B.M. are really leaving, in view of the fact that the companies plan to supply products to the South African market after they sell their subsidiaries there. Are the Actions Enough? Flowing from this is the question whether the companies' actions, announced last week, are enough to put them beyond the reach of policies and laws that penalize American companies doing business in South Africa.
10/25/1986	Car Loans: Read the Fine Print	LAST year, John Fitzgerald, a New York City police officer, decided that his wife, Eileen, needed a new car. In July, he drove her to the B. F. Curry Chevrolet dealership in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., picked out a used 1983 Mercury Marquis, and said, ''Honey, this car's for you.'' The car dealer was asking $6,895 for the car. The Fitzgeralds offered $6,500. They settled on $6,600. The floor mats were thrown in for free. Mr. Fitzgerald agreed to finance the car through Curry at 12 percent annual interest, he said, but when he signed a retail installment contract for the car, the printed interest rate was 21 percent, not 12 percent.
10/24/1986	GAUGING THE REAL IMPACT OF LEAVING SOUTH AFRICA	The announcements this week that General Motors and International Business Machines will be pulling out of South Africa have had an unquestioned symbolic importance, since both corporations have been publicly committed to using their business presence in South Africa as a force against apartheid. But the practical importance of the withdrawals - and those of other large American companies - is much harder to gauge. Indeed, the issue of the American corporate presence in South Africa provides so many opportunities for self-serving statements - and from so many different sources, including the South African Government, the companies who are leaving and those who are staying - that it is difficult to sort out exactly what impact a wholesale American business withdrawal would have. In many cases, divesting - that is, pulling out one's capital - seems to be the easy way out for the companies involved. Both G.M. and I.B.M., like almost every other American company that has left South Africa in the last two years, will continue to sell their products and services there through licensing and distribution agreements. And both are selling their subsidiaries to their own local managers or employees.
10/23/1986	IT HAS OPERATING LOSS	The General Motors Corporation reported today that it sustained an operating loss of $338.5 million in the third quarter. But income tax credits and the earnings of its financing subsidiary gave the automotive giant a net income of $264 million, or 56 cents a common share. That represents s 48.9 percent drop from last year's third quarter, when the nation's largest auto maker earned $517 million, or $1.53 a common share. Sales rose a slight 1.3 percent, to $22.8 billion, from $22.5 billion in the 1985 quarter.
10/23/1986	2 MORE COMPANIES SEEN QUITTING SOUTH AFRICA	Following the lead that the General Motors Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation took earlier this week, two more companies - Honeywell Inc. and Warner Communications Group -have apparently decided to sell their South African operations. Officially, Honeywell said yesterday only that it was considering a pullout. ''The board of Honeywell is considering certain options for the sale of its South African affiliate,'' a company statement said. ''No final action has been taken.''
10/22/1986	PULLOUTS MAY SPUR FLIGHTS BY OTHERS	I.B.M.'s decision to sell off its South African operations - coming a day after a similar announcement from General Motors - may touch off a stampede of American corporations fleeing the pressures of doing business in South Africa. ''We have not announced plans to leave,'' said Henry Kaska, an Eastman Kodak spokesman, ''but the changes that we were hoping for are coming at too slow a pace. We would like to stay, but we have indicated that real progress has to happen at a faster pace.'' Anti-apartheid activists confidently predicted - and some corporate executives conceded - that the I.B.M. and G.M. departures would be hard to ignore.
10/22/1986	PRESSURE IS CITED	Citing deteriorating business and political conditions, the International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that it would join the ranks of multinational companies withdrawing from South Africa. The announcement by John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, came one day after a similar but unrelated move by the General Motors Corporation. It had been foreshadowed by comments by Mr. Akers last spring that economic conditions in South Africa were worsening. Mr. Akers also had said that I.B.M. was feeling the economic impact of pressure from groups in this country opposed to the South African Government's policy of apartheid, or racial discrimination.
10/22/1986	Sullivan Principles' Author Hopes for Change	For the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, the announcements that two of the biggest American companies, the General Motors Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation, would sell off their South African operations came as neither a victory nor a defeat - but it did mark the end of an era. ''It's a watershed, but I hope it's a watershed for change,'' said Mr. Sullivan, a black Baptist minister from Philadelphia who in 1977 created a set of equal-employment guidelines for companies with South African operations. The guidelines have become known as the Sullivan principles.
10/22/1986	IN PRETORIA, STIFFER RESOLVE	After the United States Congress imposed sanctions on South Africa, overriding a Presidential veto, something here seemed to change, as if the measures, far from frightening an embattled white regime, stiffened its resistance. In fact, within days of the Congressional decision last month, Pretoria's white rulers seemed to revert to a traditional imagery of bullying and bluster that they had previously sought to avoid. Now, over the last two days, both the General Motors Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation have announced their withdrawal from South Africa through the device of selling subsidiaries to local employees. And, if the past is any measure of predictability, much the same kind of defiance could be forthcoming.
10/21/1986	Quotation of the Day	''This was a reluctant decision, but the right decision when you consider the pressure the U.S. company has been under and the pressure we've been under.'' - Robert A. White, the American managing director of General Motors South African Ltd. [ D30:5. ]
10/21/1986	Auto Maker's Statement	Following is the text of the statement today by Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, on the decision to sell a subsidiary, General Motors South African Ltd.: There were several factors behind the decision, but our main objective was to create a financially sound organization which will have a greater chance for long-term viability and will continue to be a positive force in the ending of apartheid. G.M.S.A. has been losing money for several years in a very difficult South African business climate and, with the current structure, we could not see our operations turning around in the near future. We have been disappointed in the pace of change in ending apartheid. Decisions about our investment in South Africa have depended on an assessment of the economic, social and political environment in that area.
10/21/1986	G.M. PLANS TO SELL SOUTH AFRICA UNIT TO A LOCAL GROUP	The General Motors Corporation, the largest American company doing business in South Africa, said today that it would withdraw from South Africa by selling its operations there to a group of investors led by local G.M. managers. Roger B. Smith, chairman of G.M., said in a statement that the company was pulling out because it had been losing money in South Africa and because little progress had been made in ending apartheid, the system of racial separation. However, the company will continue to sell automotive components to its former subsidiary. The automotive giant, which in the past has argued that the jobs it provides by staying in South Africa bring economic benefits to all races, has been a leader among American companies doing business there. Its shift was hailed by leaders of groups seeking corporate divestment from that country.
10/21/1986	DIVESTMENT ENDS A 5-YEAR STRUGGLE	The announcement by the General Motors Corporation that it would sell its South African operations ends a five-year struggle marked by increased losses and political pressures. Though G.M. executives would not disclose the size of its losses here, they said that its subsidiary, which makes Opel cars and Isuzu and Suzuki trucks, has not made money since 1981. Unit sales this year are expected to drop to 27,000, from 44,000 in 1984, and its market share to 7 percent, from 10 percent. In the last 15 months, the unit has dismissed 1,100 workers.
10/20/1986	Advertising; Cadillac Group To Biederman	Having weighed with care the credentials, the track record, the client list and the people chemistry at seven advertising agencies, the agency selection committee of the Tri-State Cadillac Dealers Association decided to go with Biederman & Company.
10/20/1986	PLASTIC-CAR PLAN DEAD, G.M.'S CHIEF CONFIRMS	Confirming industry reports, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation said today that his company had scrapped plans to produce a new generation of plastic-body sports cars. Roger B. Smith indicated in an interview with The Detroit News that G.M. has no current plans to proceed with production of front-wheel-drive plastic replacements for the current Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird sports cars. Last summer the company notified suppliers that the project, designated GM-80, was at least temporarily on hold.
10/16/1986	CORRECTIONS	A Company News report in some editions of Business Day on Oct. 9 about a 6 percent cut in base prices of 1987 Cadillacs misstated the models affected. It applies only to the Seville and El Dorado models.
10/15/1986	G.M.'s Stance On Japanese	Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, said today that unless Japanese auto makers reduced the number of cars they ship to the United States, stiffer anti-import legislation or import quotas were likely. In a statement apparently intended to clarify an interview with Automotive News, a trade publication, in which he said that G.M.'s attitude toward import restraints had changed, Mr. Smith said, ''So far, we have seen few benefits from the recent yen-dollar adjustment.'' ''If this does not soon change for the better - and dramatically - something may need to be done to forestall the passage of highly restrictive legislation,'' he continued.
10/14/1986	STRIKE AT G.M. OVER OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS EXPANDS	A strike by workers at the General Motors research and development headquarters over the issue of outside contractors widened today as 450 additional members of Local 160 of the United Automobile Workers walked off their jobs, bringing the total number of strikers to about 700. ''The corporation is trying to siphon our jobs away from the Tech Center to outside contractors,'' said Pete Kelly, president of the local, which represents skilled trades and maintenance workers at the plant, the Technical Center. Some members of the local have been on strike since Sept. 22 to protest the exclusion of union workers from a program, Project Trilby, that is developing new methods of designing and manufacturing automobiles. Union leaders say the company's plan to reduce its white-collar staff and rely more on outside consultants for engineering and technical services will cause an erosion of union jobs as well.
10/13/1986	G.M.-BACKED ISSUE IN DEMAND	The First Boston Corporation has increased a planned offering of debt securities backed by General Motors Corporation automobile loans, to $4 billion, from $3.2 billion. That would make it equal to the largest nongovernmental underwriting ever made. Strong indications of interest from buyers led to the decision to increase the offering. That decision was made Friday, a day after the asset-backed financing deal was originally announced. The only other $4 billion offering was underwritten earlier this year by Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., a First Boston affiliate in Britain.

10/8/1986	G.M. Rate Cuts End With Backlog Low	The General Motors Corporation's record-breaking sales-incentive campaign will end Wednesday, having largely accomplished its aim of clearing out unsold 1986 models. The campaign featured interest rates on auto loans of as low as 2.9 percent, the lowest in G.M.'s history.
10/1/1986	FUEL ECONOMY STANDARD FOR CARS SAID TO BE EASED FOR '87 AND '88	The Department of Transportation, granting a request by the General Motors Corporation, has decided to ease the fuel economy standard for passenger cars for the next two model years, sources close to the department said today. The reported action goes against a recommendation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the Transportation Department that is responsible for setting and enforcing laws on fuel economy. The highway safety agency had proposed that the standard be relaxed, but not so much as General Motors sought.
10/1/1986	G.M. Saturn Plant Financing Begun	A $65 million issue of 7 1/4 percent pollution control bonds due in 2005 to finance facilities at the General Motors Corporation's new Saturn Corporation plant in Tennessee was offered yesterday at a price of 100 through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation. The bonds, which are issued by the Industrial Development Board of Maury County, Tenn., on behalf of Saturn and G.M., will be used to refund variable-rate notes which were privately placed with Chemical Bank at the end of last year.
9/26/1986	G.M. Plans to End Chevette in 1987	The General Motors Corporation will stop building its subcompact Chevrolet Chevette next year and will shift production of the full-size Chevrolet Caprice from Detroit to the Chevette plant in Lakewood, Ga.
9/26/1986	G.M. to Lay Off 1,250 in Canada	The General Motors Corporation plant in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough is laying off half its 2,500 workers because of a drop in North American sales of large vans, according to a union spokesman.
9/25/1986	Low-Car-Rate Extension Seen	Sweeping sales incentives on automobiles will continue as long as the General Motors Corporation produces more cars than it can sell without the incentives, Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, said today. Mr. Iacocca termed the current round of incentives, which includes interest rates as low as 2.4 percent, ''nuts.''
9/22/1986	CHEVROLET SPRINT TOPS ECONOMY LIST	The Chevrolet Sprint ER still gets the best gasoline mileage of any car on the highway, but it is slightly worse than last year in a market that appears to de-emphasize economy. The Japanese-made Sprint, with a five-speed manual transmission, recorded 54 miles a gallon on the urban driving test and 58 miles a gallon on the highway test administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. Last year's figures were 55 and 60 miles. The Federal agency says it has not changed its tests. Bill Ball of the General Motors Corporation's Government relations staff said that buyers were unquestionably more interested in performance, but that Chevrolet engineers had told him the auto had not changed and the lower figures resulted from ''normal testing variability.''
9/17/1986	Avrett Drops Cadillac	Avrett Free & Ginsberg said that it had resigned the $2 million Cadillac Tri-State Dealership account yesterday. The agency said the split was ''amicable'' and resulted from its decision to focus on packaged-goods clients.
9/14/1986	About Cars; CHEVY'S CAVALIER GETS SOME SIZZLE	From the beginning, Chevrolet knew that its subcompact Cavalier needed an infusion of horsepower. That was 1982, and the little car's 88 horses put the four-cylinder Cavalier squarely into the yawn category. It has taken a long time, but the Z24 has finally arrived, doing for the front-wheel-drive Cavalier what the Z28 did for the Camaro. And if it is still less than a world beater, it is a car that has character and more than a bit of zip.
9/13/1986	G.M. PLANS 1987 PRICE RISE OF 2.6%	The General Motors Corporation will raise prices of its 1987 passenger cars by an average of 2.6 percent over this year's models, the company said today. ''This price increase reflects the partial recovery of higher material, labor and other manufacturing costs,'' G. M. said. The 1987 models go on sale Oct. 9.
9/9/1986	G.M. ASKS U.S. TO EASE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS	The General Motors Corporation has asked the Federal Government to ease past and future Federal fuel economy standards for passenger cars so the company can avoid paying a $385 million penalty for failure to meet the standards. The G.M. plan, which was proposed recently, raises several new issues in the continuing debate over fuel economy standards and has stirred considerable discussion within the Department of Transportation, which must rule on the request this month. The standards are part of a 1975 energy conservation law under which the entire line of automobiles sold by a manufacturer in a given model year must not consume more than the specified level of fuel for that model year. The standards have been fought from the start by the manufacturers as unrealistic, while energy conservation groups and their supporters in Congress have countered that the tough measures are needed to help stretch gasoline supplies.
9/7/1986	A NEW BREED OF IMPORT, MADE IN THE U.S.A	THE sporty white FX-16 subcompact that rolled off the assembly line at Fremont, Calif., last week was the first of a new class of made-in-America Japanese cars. No other such vehicle is the product of a joint venture between a Japanese and an American automaker, and none other bears a union label.
9/4/1986	U.S.-Made Toyota	The first Toyota automobile assembled in the United States is scheduled to come off the assembly line Thursday at the northern California factory of New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a joint venture of the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation. The Corolla FX-16, a sporty version of the Corolla subcompact, will be priced between $9,000 and $13,000, depending upon options. It is expected to be available to buyers in October.
9/4/1986	Recall of G.M. Cars Urged	Citing 1,500 driver complaints, an automobile safety group has asked two Federal agencies to order the General Motors Corporation to recall six million of its cars and repair what are said to be power steering problems without charge. The Center for Auto Safety said Tuesday that it had filed a petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeking an investigation of safety problems caused by the reported sudden loss of power steering in 1980-84 front-wheel-drive A-, J- and X-body cars.
8/31/1986	IN QUOTES	''Next thing, what G.M.'s going to do is say, 'Come on down, we're going to make the payments for you.' '' -An unnamed G.M. dealer, on the latest incentive program.
8/30/1986	G.M. SALES QUICK TO RESPOND	In Chicago, Frank Chevrolet sold 28 cars Thursday, about double the usual daily rate, according to Zollie Frank, the agency's president. And in Omaha, H.&H. Chevrolet moved 20 models yesterday, also about twice its normal sales. ''It showed up in all price ranges,'' said Steve Hinchcliffe, sales manager. General Motors dealers across the nation reported a quick consumer response - with as much as a doubling of sales - to the auto maker's announcement on Thursday of 2.9 percent financing on three-year car loans. The rate will be available until the 1987 models go on sale Oct. 7.
8/29/1986	G.M. OFFERS SWEEPING PLAN	The General Motors Corporation yesterday introduced a sweeping sales incentive program and said it would delay introducing its 1987 models until early October. The moves, which dealers reported on Wednesday, are intended to help sales of more than a million 1986 model cars and trucks that are sitting on dealer lots. The incentives include a 2.9 percent annual interest charge on a 36-month car loan, the lowest in G.M.'s history, and will be in effect through Oct. 8, the company said. Analysts described the package, which applies to all 1986 passenger cars and most light-duty trucks, as a good one for consumers.
8/29/1986	G.M. CONFRONTS HARSH REALITY	The General Motors Corporation's offer today of historically low 2.9 percent financing is an attempt by the giant auto maker to cope with the consequences of its institutional overoptimism. With more than a million unsold cars and trucks clogging its dealers' lots, G.M. was forced to take dramatic action to sell off the 1986 models before the 1987 vehicles come pouring from its factories. Analysts expect the incentives to work, but at the cost to the nation's largest auto maker of a third-quarter operating loss and a weak sales reception for the 1987 models. The G.M. action surprised the rest of the auto industry, which had been expecting a new round of incentives but nothing near the 2.9 percent offer, the lowest rate G.M. has ever put on an auto loan.
8/28/1986	G.M. SEEN OFFERING 2.9% RATE	The General Motors Corporation, in an effort to reduce its heavy stockpiles, will slash interest rates on 1986 cars on Thursday to 2.9 percent for three-year loans, automobile dealers said today. The new rates - four percentage points lower than the incentive rates now offered on 36-month loans for selected G.M. models - are to apply through Oct. 8, said Betty Warner, financing manager of Kaiser Brothers Oldsmobile here. That apparently indicates that the nation's largest automaker will slightly delay introduction of 1987 models until it can whittle down its inventories.
8/26/1986	AUG. 11-20 AUTO SALES DOWN 1.3%	Sales of new cars by the major domestic manufacturers fell 1.3 percent in the August 11-20 period, hurt by a 10.4 percent drop at the General Motors Corporation. Brisk sales of light trucks, however, brought the total light-vehicle sales, including cars and light trucks, to 297,790, up 6.6 percent from mid-August of 1985. Truck sales were especially strong at the Ford Motor Company which reported a 77.4 percent increase in light-truck deliveries from a somewhat soft period last year.
8/26/1986	G.M. Offer To Trim Jobs	The General Motors Corporation said today that it is offering new incentives for white-collar employees to resign. G. M. has said previously that it plans to cut its salaried work force 25 percent by 1989.
8/24/1986	IN LINDEN WORKERS STRUGGLE TO ADJUST TO A HIGH-TECH LIFE	FUZZY peach navel is the recommended drink at the Old Corner Inn here, one of the latest and most unlikely ripple effects of the American auto industry's march toward high technology. ''The day of the heavy drink after work is over,'' said Morris Scialabba, whose bar and sandwich shop stands a few blocks from the newly rennovated automobile plant. ''Now we're dealing with highly intellectual, highly technical crews. Even if it's the same guys, the more technical their work, the more sensible they have to drink. So we're coming back with more sweet drinks.'' (A fuzzy peach navel is peach schnapps, orange juice and club soda.) The expanding drink selection is among the minor changes and major upheavals Linden and its workers are going through as they struggle to adjust to the $300 million high-tech renovation of the town's 49-year-old automotive plant.
8/19/1986	DETROIT CAR MAKERS PREPARE FOR NEW ERA OF LEAN TIMES	The Big Three auto makers have started anew to cut jobs, close plants and revamp production to make attractive, trouble-free cars. They are doing so to arm themselves for a coming glut in the market. In the next three or four years, auto showrooms are likely to be flooded with new offerings, as manufacturers from all over the globe scratch for a share of the American market, easily the world's most lucrative. The result will be a consumer's delight but a producer's nightmare. It will mean a fresh assault on a domestic industry still recovering from the grievous loss of ground to Japanese imports in the early 1980's.
8/17/1986	Auto Speed-Up Inquiry Now Focuses on Audis	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has dropped an investigation of sudden acceleration of vehicles manufactured by the General Motors Corporation and is opening an investigation into alleged incidents of sudden acceleration in 300,000 Audi 5000's, made by Volkswagen of America. The agency announced Friday that it was closing its investigation of the General Motors vehicles because it was unable to identify any defect that could account for the speed-ups.
8/16/1986	G.M., Volvo Set Truck Linkup	The General Motors Corporation, at the bottom of the depressed heavy-duty truck market, said today that it plans to phase out its sole big-truck assembly line and combine American and Canadian operations with A.B. Volvo of Sweden. G.M. and the Volvo White Truck Corporation of Greensboro, N.C., plan to form a joint venture company called the Volvo G.M. Heavy Truck Corporation and to have it developing, producing and selling big rigs by 1988.
8/10/1986	G.M. OFFERS FREE REPAIR OF FAULTY SEAT BELTS	The General Motors Corporation, which markets 44 percent of all the cars sold in the United States, has decided to offer free repairs of defective seat belts in its cars and trucks. The company's decision, acknowledged earlier this week, could put pressure on its competitors to match or exceed its plan in moves that could save automobile owners millions of dollars in repairs and replacement costs. General Motors rejected lifetime warranties for seat belts, noting that it did not provide a lifetime guarantee on any of the parts or systems in its vehicles. But, in response to an inquiry, the company said, ''If there are any safety-related defects in our safety belts, G.M. will correct them at no charge.''
8/9/1986	ROBOTICS MAKER PLANS RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS	Battered by cutbacks in spending for automation at the General Motors Corporation, the GMFanuc Robotics Corporation, the nation's leading robot supplier, announced a restructuring plan today that included laying off nearly 30 percent of its employees. The news reflected GMFanuc's heavy exposure to the auto industry in general and especially to G.M. and was also seen as an indication of the tough conditions faced by most of the robotics industry. The auto makers are also the most important customers of other robotics companies.
8/7/1986	G.M. TO CLOSE A PARTS PLANT AND LAY OFF 1,200 UPSTATE	The General Motors Corporation announced yesterday that it would gradually end its engine parts foundry operation in Massena, N.Y., over the next two years, leaving 1,200 of the plant's 1,300 employees at least temporarily out of work. Arsen Markarian, the Mayor of Massena, a town of approximately 16,000 residents 70 miles southwest of Montreal on the St. Lawrence River, said of the automobile manufacturer, ''We view them as vultures.'' Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, citing an agreement under which General Motors has been receiving cheap electricity from the state for 29 years in exchange for a long-term guarantee of jobs, said in a statement that company ''walks away with its profits, leaving the North Country behind and the state looking as if it were conned.'' General Motors officials, however, said most of the laid-off workers would receive substantial benefits, transfers to other plants and, if necessary, retraining. And they said a new manufacturing process for automobile parts may make it possible for many workers eventually to be rehired at the Massena plant.
8/6/1986	10-Day Car Sales Rise 4.3%	The domestic automobile manufacturers today reported a 4.3 percent increase in car sales in the last 10 days of July and a 2.4 percent gain for the entire month, but a sharp drop in annualized selling rates prompted some analysts to warn that the new-car market may be softening. Sales of imported autos increased 13.9 percent and imported light trucks were up 5.4 percent, but domestic light-truck sales were off 7.1 percent. The strength of the imports was sufficient to lift the entire consumer-oriented motor vehicle market by 2.5 percent in July. ''We were expecting an annualized rate of about 8 million for the month instead of the 7.4 million we actually had,'' said Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Economics. ''It is another piece of evidence that the economy is beginning to slow down and that consumer confidence is eroding.''
8/5/1986	G.M. Names Two Officers	The General Motors Corporation board named two new vice presidents and approved a job swap between two executives, the nation's No. 1 auto maker announced today.
8/3/1986	OLD UNIONISTS TALK PROUDLY OF FLINT STRIKE	A lovely, bittersweet affair it was, the sitdowners' last picnic. Heaps of food. Baked ham. Fried chicken. Potato salad. Pickled beets. Deviled eggs. What must have been a dozen varieties of baked beans. Cakes, pies and cupcakes galore. Coffee. Iced tea.
8/3/1986	Last Vestige of a Silly Energy Policy	THIS fall, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration must once again decide whether to roll back the Federal fuel economy standards. General Motors and Ford have petitioned the Administration to lower the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standard for model year 1987. Their eminently sensible reasons are that enforcing the standard would hurt consumers and introduce harmful economic distortions while largely failing to produce the energy savings that they were intended to promote. CAFE standards are the last major vestige of the misbegotten energy regulation of the 1970's. In 1973, just after the first energy crunch and well before the standards were established, the average new American car attained 14.2 miles per gallon. Under the law, passed in 1975, the average mileage of new cars rose in a series of steps, scheduled to top off at 27.5 m.p.g. in 1986.
7/31/1986	G.M. Continues to Build In-House Marketing	General Motors, as part of its continuing effort to build its internal marketing capability to oversee some $2 billion in annual advertising and promotion spending, has hired Michael A. Browner from the Texize division of Dow Consumer Products for the new position of director of media operations. He will be working for the G. M. Marketing and Product Planning Staff, reporting to Philip Guarascio, former media director of Benton & Bowles, who came in as executive director of advertising services. Mr. Guarascio has since been involved in a program designed to get his employer the best possible negotiated rates from magazines. Mr. Browner, a New Yorker and a graduate of the City University of New York's Baruch College, worked for both Lennen & Newell and N. W. Ayer before swinging over to the client side at Lever Brothers.
7/28/1986	G.M. Offers $500 Rebate	As an alternative to cut-rate financing, the General Motors Corporation said today that it had added a $500 rebate on its so-called A cars.
7/24/1986	G.M. NET FALLS 15.7% IN QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation reported today that second-quarter earnings fell 15.7 percent, to $978 million, or $2.81 a share of common stock, compared with $1.16 billion, or $3.58 a share, in the 1985 period. Most analysts had expected the nation's largest automaker to earn about $3.10 a share. G.M.'s sales in the second quarter totaled $27.6 billion, up 10 percent from $25.1 billion in the 1985 period. The company said in a statement that earnings in its car and truck business had been hurt by ''the costs of extensive marketing campaign in the United States, the implementation of new technology designed to improve G.M.'s long-term global competitiveness and lower interest income.''
7/22/1986	G.M., Deere Plan Joint Diesel Venture	The General Motors Corporation and Deere & Company said today that they intend to form a joint venture to design and produce diesel engines. The new company is expected to have annual worldwide sales of $1.5 billion. The venture, which has not yet been named, will include the diesel engine operations of Deere and the Detroit Diesel Allison divison of G.M. It is expected to employ about 6,000.
7/15/1986	G.M. REINS IN SOME CAPITAL PROJECTS	The General Motors Corporation, in recent decisions to shrink or suspend some future product programs, is pulling back from some forms of advanced technology and at the same time is preparing for an even more intensely competitive market at the end of the decade, industry analysts and officials said today. G.M. officials have been saying publicly that spending is at a peak level and likely to decline for the rest of the 1980's. The president of G.M., F. James McDonald, told reporters on May 23 that spending will ''start to taper down'' from between $9.5 billion to $10 billion this year to between $6 billion to $7 billion by 1989. In recent weeks, trade journals have reported that G.M. is cutting the number of models in a broad midsize car program; has dropped a plan to build a ''world'' van, which would have been assembled in G.M. plants abroad as well as domestically, and has suspended a program to bring out a line of Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models with plastic outer bodies, code-named the GM-80 project. These developments have since been confirmed, directly or indirectly, by company officals.
7/6/1986	TORONADO A SPIFFY COMPACT	IT is handy to refer to rear-wheel drive as ''conventional,'' but the new convention really has it the other way round. Most of today's cars are pulled rather than pushed, with transversely mounted engines driving the same wheels that steer. Front-wheel drive has been around for a long time, of course -those wonderful old Cords from 1929 to '37 come to mind - but the daddy of today's trend was that traditional innovator, Oldsmobile, the same marque that brought us practical automatic transmissions in 1940 and popularized the V-8 engine nine years later. As introduced, the front-drive '66 Olds Toronado was a hardtop coupe with extensive standard equipment, including Turbo-HydraMatic transmission, a 385-horsepower V-8 and something called a ''strato-bench'' front seat. It has been called the most important car of the 60's, and it was without question a landmark vehicle.
7/4/1986	G.M. Scrapping Plans for Factory	The General Motors Corporation said it was scrapping plans for a $60 million plant to make plastic mini-van parts, a venture that was expected to create 1,000 jobs in Framingham by 1989.
7/4/1986	JUNE 21-30 AUTO SALES ROSE 21.2%	Sales of new American-made cars rose 21.2 percent in late June from the comparable period of last year, a time when sales were soft. Light-truck sales were also up, the makers said today, by 10.5 percent. Industry analysts said much of the strength came from buyers taking advantage of incentive programs that were to expire at the end of June or early this month. For all of June, sales of domestically produced autos increased 8.8 percent and light-truck sales were 3 percent above June 1985. The annual selling rate for cars was 8.1 million, up from 7.6 million in June 1985 but down slightly from an 8.2 million rate in May. The rate is seasonally adjusted.
7/3/1986	Denial of Jobless Benefits Is Upheld	The Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 today that states may deny unemployment compensation to workers who help finance a strike that causes them to be laid off, even if they are not themselves on strike. The Court upheld a Michigan law under which an employee is ineligible for unemployment compensation if he has provided ''financing,'' by means other than payment of regular union dues, for a strike that causes his unemployment. Associate Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion stressed that Federal labor law gives states discretion either to grant or to refuse unemployment compensation to strikers, even though the state's decision would affect the balance of power between employers and unions. An Appeal to Federal Law The court rejected arguments by three automobile workers that the Michigan law was pre-empted by Federal labor law because it penalized them for paying compulsory dues into a special strike fund.
6/30/1986	G.M. Widens Financing	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would expand its 5.9 annual percentage rate financing program to six more models starting July 1. The move, which was expected, increases to 10 the number of car models in the program.
6/29/1986	NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Detroit; G.M'S EFFORTS TO CUT ITS TAXES	THE General Motors Corporation is in the midst of a campaign to reduce its property taxes in the areas, mostly in the Middle West, where it has extensive production plants and other facilities. The company is arguing that the assessed values of many of its properties are well above current market values. But officials of some of the communities involved say they fear that any sharp reductions in taxes paid on G.M. plants will imperil schools and civic programs.
6/26/1986	G.M. to Sell Bus Operations	The General Motors Corporation, citing reduced orders and a stagnant bus industry, said it had decided to try to sell its bus operations. Roger B. Smith, the chairman of G.M., said that employees were notified last week of the possible sale.
6/24/1986	G.M.'S SPUTTERING OPEL UNIT	Adam Opel A.G., the sturdy West German subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, used to be called the money machine. But Opel, the linchpin of G.M.'s European activities, has been sputtering lately and G.M. officials are revamping the big European operation to nudge it back to profitability. Last year, the division, G.M.'s second largest after the domestic United States unit, lost $372.1 million, about $80 million more than in 1984. The widening loss came despite fast-selling models that helped G.M. dramatically widen its European market share last year to 11.4 percent, from 9.6 percent as recently as 1982. Seeming Contradiction The seeming contradiction in results arises because Europe's Big Six auto makers - Volkswagen, Fiat, Peugeot, Renault and the European units of Ford and G.M. - are all strugglng for shares of a relatively flat automobile market. That has translated into vicious price discounting and ballooning advertising budgets, both of which have depressed profit margins and left many of the majors losing money.
6/18/1986	G.M. in Venture With Egyptians	The General Motors Corporation will make compact and midsized cars in Egypt in a joint venture with Egyptian partners beginning next year, G.M. said. A company statement said the joint-venture concern, the General Misr Car Company, will build and market compact Opel Corsas and midsized Opel Asconas, with production scheduled to begin in mid-1987. G.M. said it would hold a 30 percent stake in the new company, with the rest held by Egyptian investors including El-Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company, which is owned by the Egyptian Government.
6/16/1986	Maryland Dean Taking Economist Post at G.M.	On July 1, George C. Eads will be moving from his post as dean of the School of Public Affairs at the University of Maryland to be chief economist for the General Motors Corporation. Mr. Eads will be replacing Marina Whitman as a G.M. vice president and chief economist. Mrs. Whitman has been promoted to group vice president in charge of G.M.'s public affairs staffs and Mr. Eads will be reporting to her.
6/10/1986	G.M. Research Awards	Three scientists whose discoveries produced important advances in understanding and treating cancer and insights into the biology of life were named winners yesterday of the General Motors Research Foundation prizes for 1986. The winners were Dr. Harald zur Hausen of the German Cancer Center in Heidelberg; Dr. Donald Pinkel of the M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute in Houston, and Dr. Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. Each will receive $100,000 and an additional $30,000 to organize a scientific conference in his field.
6/10/1986	CITY MAY GET FREE BUSES IN A TEST OF CLEANER FUEL	The General Motors Corporation has tentatively agreed with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to develop buses that burn clean methanol fuel and to give the first six buses free to New York City. In negotiations with the environmental agency and two public interest groups, the auto maker has agreed to a plan under which it will develop the buses as an alternative to vehicles powered with heavily polluting diesel fuel, an agency official said today. Diesel exhaust from buses and trucks has been described as a threat to public health in densely populated areas. New York was chosen in part because a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, found that pollution from diesel-powered vehicles presented particularly severe health problems there, including cancer.
6/4/1986	LABOR BOARD REBUFFS A CHALLENGE TO U.A.W. ACCORD AT G.M. PLANT	The United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation won a major challenge Monday to their agreement for union representation at G.M.'s $3.5 billion Saturn Corporation plant being built in Tennessee. The general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board effectively dismissed a complaint by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation that the agreement gave an illegal preference to U.A.W. members in filling the 6,000 jobs at the plant. The general counsel, Rosemary Collyer, authorized the board's regional director in Detroit to dismiss the charge, saying the agreement was a result of bargaining between the company and the union on the effects that the Saturn project will have on employees at existing General Motors plants.
6/1/1986	G.M. Working On Hudson Plant	WORKERS cheered last June when Governor Cuomo announced some of the benefits that would allow the General Motors Corporation to keep its automobile-assembly plant open on the Hudson River in North Tarrytown, N.Y. The plant, with 4,500 workers, was one of the largest blue-collar employers in Westchester County. It was also G.M.'s oldest factory, having produced cars for the company since 1914, and one of its costliest to operate. There had been talk for years of closing it.
5/30/1986	Levy, Flaxman Wins An Oldsmobile Account	Levy, Flaxman & Associates has won the $6 million Oldsmobile Dealers Association, Philadelphia account, also known as the ''Olds Connection,'' after a six-week, three-way competition. Oldsmobile leaves behind Shaw & Platt. Richard Horowitz, who had handled the account there, will now join the new agency as executive vice president in charge of the new account.
5/29/1986	Advertising; G.M. Puts Stress on Efficiency	The General Motors Corporation, which spent $978 million last year for advertising worldwide, wants to use the clout of those dollars across media lines and national boundaries to get the lowest prices from the media. Roger B. Smith, chairman of the world's biggest automobile manufacturer, disclosed his intentions today as keynote speaker at the 30th world congress of the International Advertising Association. A record crowd of more than 1,400 was at Chicago's downtown Hyatt Regency for the first American gathering in 22 years. And since the members of the audience were all advertising people -some of whom were listening to Mr. Smith, thanks to simultaneous translations into Japanese, Korean and Spanish - most were familiar with the moves already being taken at G.M. The company has brought in Phil Gurascio, an agency media heavyweight, from one of its shops in an all-out attempt to get multiple-title magazine publishers to hammer out new favorable volume and frequency discount deals for the auto giant.
5/26/1986	PRETORIA DIVESTMENT QUICKENS	The pace of withdrawal from South Africa by American companies has quickened, as some of the biggest corporations in the United States reconsider doing business in the economically and politically troubled country. Last week, the General Motors Corporation, in a reversal of a stance it held for many years, said it would stop selling vehicles to South African military or police agencies. In recent months, the leaders of other large corporations with major operations in South Africa, including the International Business Machines Corporation and the Xerox Corporation, have raised the possibility that they might end their operations there if business conditions continue to deteriorate. At least 48 American companies have pulled out of South Africa since the beginning of last year, according to a study by the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a not-for-profit organization based in Washington that studies issues affecting investors and corporations. The center's report said that 38 United States companies ended their presence in South Africa in 1985 and that 10 have left so far this year. In 1984, seven United States companies left South Africa, the center said.
5/24/1986	G.M. CUTS ITS SALES TO PRETORIA	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would stop selling cars and trucks to police and military agencies in South Africa in response to complaints about that country's racial policies. However, the company defeated, by a vote of 91 percent to 9 percent, a shareholder resolution that would have forced the action on the company. The actions took place at the company's annual shareholders meeting held here. Roger B. Smith, chairman of G.M., said the decision to stop the police and military sales had been promoted by the shareholder initiative and what he described as more stringent Department of Commerce regulations on exports to South Africa.
5/23/1986	G.M.'S SALES TO PRETORIA	The General Motors Corporation may be preparing to stop selling cars and trucks to police and military units in South Africa, according to sources close to the situation. The company's operations in South Africa are expected to provoke extended discussion Friday at the company's annual shareholders meeting. A group of stockholders, including the New York City Employees Retirement System and religious groups, has proposed a resolution that would force the company to halt such sales.
5/22/1986	BRIEFS	Debt * General Motors Corp. is issuing 22 billion yen of noncallable 5 3/4 percent Eurobonds due 1991 at 101 1/2 through Mitsui Finance International Ltd. * Healthco International Inc. is offering $30 million of 7 percent convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 at 100 through Shearson Lehman Brothers. The debentures are convertible into common stock at $27.50 a share.
5/21/1986	G.M. Plastic Van	The General Motors Corporation plans to build a front-wheel-drive plastic-body mini-van for sale later this decade by Chevrolet and Pontiac dealers, a spokesman said today. The vehicle will be assembled in Framingham, Mass., where G.M. now builds the Chevrolet Celebrity and Oldsmobile Ciera.
5/17/1986	G.M. and Suzuki	The General Motors Corporation and the Japanese auto maker Suzuki are close to agreement on a joint car-making venture in Canada and will announce a site soon, a G.M. spokesman said.
5/15/1986	Nova Overtakes Corolla	Chevrolet's Nova has passed the Toyota Motor Corporation's look-alike Corolla in sales. In this year's first four months 45,979 Novas were sold, against 37,423 Corollas, Ed Lechtzin, a spokesman for the General Motors Corporation division, said today. The Nova is jointly produced by G.M. and Toyota at Fremont, Calif.
5/10/1986	TOP EXECUTIVES SAY THEY BACK SENATE TAX BILL	The heads of most of the nation's biggest corporations say they are inclined to support a radical overhaul of the tax code passed this week by the Senate Finance Committee despite specific provisions that would be costly to their companies or industries. Many members of the elite Business Council, attending a semiannual meeting here at the Homestead, qualified their endorsement. They said they would not be able to support alterations to bring the bill closer in line with the one passed by the House of Representatives, and that the transition must be smoothly phased in. They also said their support assumed that a detailed analysis would not uncover adverse consequences not yet apparent.
5/8/1986	More Plastic Cars	The General Motors Corporation said that it would probably be producing one million plastic-body cars a year by 1990, which would have major implications for the American steel industry. One million cars, at current sales rates, represents more than 20 percent of G.M.'s car production. Robert Costello, G.M.'s executive director of purchasing, said today at a meeting of the Steel Service Center Institute, ''We are looking at the likelihood that GM may produce as many as one million cars with plastic outer panels by 1990, which is up from 150,000 this year.''
4/27/1986	THE 'IRRITANT' THEY CALL PEROT	H. ROSS PEROT, the quixotic founder of the computer-services company Electronic Data Systems, champion of prisoners of war, crusader against drug abuse, advocate of educational reform, super-patriot, second-richest man in America, is having a frisky time with his new hobby. On weekends, he pulls on khaki pants, buttons up a smudged shirt and settles his baseball cap on his head. Then he drives out to a General Motors dealership and pokes around. For about 15 minutes, he usually is treated in the blase way reserved for someone who looks like he can't afford a car radio, let alone a car. Then, inevitably, a senior hand will recognize him as a G.M. board member and its most powerful single shareholder, and, in Mr. Perot's words, ''it's a full court press.'' What he would like, he says, ''is for every customer to get the sort of attention I get after the first 15 minutes.''
4/26/1986	G.M.'s Auto Rates Are Cut to 5.9%	The General Motors Corporation, apparently concerned that existing interest rate incentives were not stimulating enough sales, announced a new program today featuring even lower rates. Separately, in a move that also reflects the sluggish sales, G.M. said that it was eliminating 1,150 jobs at its Rochester Products division factory in Rochester, N.Y. It also said that it was temporarily laying off 6,600 workers at two car assembly plants. The company said it would offer a financing rate of 5.9 percent on 30-month loans from its General Motors Acceptance Corporation subsidiary for the purchase of Chevrolet Chevette, Pontiac Fiero, Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Buick LeSabre models. G.M. had been offering a 6.9 percent rate since April 14.
4/25/1986	BL Shelves Sale of Units	The state-owned auto maker BL P.L.C. has shelved plans to sell its profitable Land-Rover, Range-Rover and Freight-Rover divisions to the private sector, Paul Channon, the Secretary of Trade and Industry, said today. The move comes after the General Motors Corporation, accusing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government of bowing to political pressure, last month withdrew both its bid to buy the operations that make the jeep-like vehicles and its bid for BL's loss-ridden trucks division.
4/23/1986	PROFITS FALL AT CHRYSLER AND G.M.	The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation today reported earnings declines for the first quarter that were generally in line with analyst's expectations. Although the earnings were below the level of early 1984 and 1985, the reports indicated that the companies were entering their fourth consecutive year of robust profits. G.M. earned $1.06 billion, a drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent from $1.07 billion in the comparable quarter of 1985. Earnings per share of common stock fell to $3.11, from $3.32, because some of G.M.'s earnings are now assigned to the E and H classes of stock issued in connection with the acquisition of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation and the Hughes Aircraft Company.
4/19/1986	TOP G.M. FIVE EACH GOT OVER $1 MILLION	Roger B. Smith, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, collected $1,852,850 in salary, bonus and stock-option profits in 1985, a year that saw all five top executives of the company earn more than $1 million. Because G.M. has a second bonus plan in which payouts are made only every other year, it is not clear how much Mr. Smith actually earned for 1985, including deferred bonus. In 1984, this separate, long-term bonus added $750,000 to Mr. Smith's compensation, reflecting several years of accumulated long-term bonus.
4/18/1986	Chrysler Offers 6.8% Loan Rate	The Chrysler Corporation responded today to the General Motors Corporation's latest interest rate incentives, offering a slightly lower rate that covers only a small part of its product line. Chrysler said it would offer 6.8 percent financing for up to 60 months on its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars and its full-size vans and sports utility vehicles.
4/14/1986	TOP U.S. COMPANY: BUSINESS MAGAZINES DIFFER	Call it a battle of lists. Amid much ballyhoo, the leading business magazines have weighed in with their annual rankings of America's largest companies. And the winner is: the General Motors Corporation, International Business Machines and Citicorp. Confused? Don't be. All three corporate giants top a chart, but which chart they top depends on which publication you read. Each magazine ranks companies differently and this year there are more lists than ever for readers to ponder.
4/14/1986	G.M. OFFERS NEW LOAN FINANCINGS	The General Motors Corporation, as expected, began a broad round of low-rate financing sales incentives today in an apparent effort to avoid cutting back production. James G. Vorhes, G.M.'s vice president of sales, said he expected the new incentives to ''give a strong new spurt to the market'' during the spring selling season. The announcement of the new program, with rates as low as 6.9 percent, came a day before prices of G.M. cars are set to increase an average of 2.9 percent. While G.M. has not released details of the price increases, which would average about $350 a car, the new financing program appears to nullify the effect of the increase.
4/12/1986	G.M. INCENTIVE PLAN	The General Motors Corporation will offer a new auto sales incentive program Sunday, with the centerpiece a prevailing loan interest rate of slightly more than 8 percent, WWJ radio in Detroit reported today. The program will contain as many as three interest rate programs on cars financed through its in-house credit subsidiary, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation.
4/10/1986	G.M. Sets Offering	The General Motors Corporation is offering $500 million of 8 1/8 percent debentures due 2016 at a price of 99.167, to yield 8.20 percent, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. The debentures, which are rated Aa-1 by Moody's and AA+ by S.&P., yield about 7/8 percentage point above 30-year Treasury bonds and are not refundable for 10 years.
4/9/1986	PRICE GOAL REVISED FOR G.M.'S SATURN	Officials of the General Motors Corporation confirmed today that the upcoming Saturn line of cars would not attempt to compete with the cheapest imports. Instead, Saturn's president, Richard G. LeFauve, said the cars would emulate the Japanese practice of offering small cars with a relatively high level of standard equipment -and higher price tags. ''We're going to give people more car for the price,'' he said. Nevertheless, he said the Saturn cars would be ''on the low end of the price scale.''
4/8/1986	G.M. PROMOTES TECHNICAL AIDE	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had promoted Robert J. Eaton to vice president and group executive in charge of the Technical Staffs Group, effective May 1. He replaces Alex C. Mair, who is retiring.
4/7/1986	SATURN'S UNCERTAIN FUTURE	Owen F. Bieber, the president of the United Automobile Workers union, calls it ''one last stab at retaining small-car production in the United States.'' Yet, as the General Motors Corporation prepares to dedicate the site for its Saturn Corporation plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., on Tuesday, questions are being raised within the industry about the outlook for the new organization. And the repeated statements by top G.M. executives that Saturn dealerships will change the rules of automobile franchising have raised fears among dealers that the company is seeking to lessen their independence and squeeze their profit margins. When G.M. announced in January 1985 that the Saturn project would become its sixth automotive operating unit, the stated goal was ''to produce small cars in the United States that are cost-competitive with the lowest-priced imports.''
4/4/1986	10-DAY AUTO SALES FALL 21.5%	Sales of American-made cars slumped 21.5 percent in late March and 15.5 percent for the full month, as the modest interest-rate incentives of the Big Three evidently failed to entice buyers. Sales of imported cars increased 21.8 percent for the month from March 1985. The softening of the market for domestic cars forced the General Motors Corporation this week to cut back its ambitious production program, which the company had been counting on to recapture its historic share of the American market. Many analysts and industry executives are predicting that G.M. will have to mount an expensive new incentive campaign to sell cars already in stock.
4/3/1986	G.M. PLANS OUTPUT CUTS AND LAYOFFS OF 5,000	The General Motors Corporation is planning its biggest cutback in car production since the industry slump of 1982. More than 5,000 G.M. workers in four states will be added to the company's list of employees placed on indefinite layoff. The action follows months of effort by the nation's largest auto maker to bolster sales through incentives such as cut-rate financing. But analysts say the allure of incentives has faded.
3/28/1986	G.M. PLANS 2.9% PRICE INCREASE	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would increase the price of its cars by an average of 2.9 percent, or about $350 a unit, on April 14. That is just two days after the scheduled end of G.M.'s 9.9 percent interest rate incentives, which are worth about $250. So, together, the effective cost of a G.M. car that was covered by the incentive campaign would rise about $600.
3/27/1986	Military Job Goes to Pratt	The Allison Gas Turbine division of the General Motors Corporation has chosen Pratt & Whitney to be the second production source for engines that will power a new tilt-rotor plane for the military, the companies said today. The Navy selected Allison, based in Indianapolis, as the prime engine builder late last year.
3/25/1986	LAND-ROVER IS STILL 'WRAPPED IN THE UNION JACK'	Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's drive to sell off, or ''privatize,'' the country's nationalized industries has been thrown out of gear by a burst of patriotic sentiment that has turned a rugged and deliberately unstylish product of the English Midlands into a symbol of true British grit. That product is the Land-Rover, an aluminum-body, four-wheel-drive vehicle developed from the jeep after World War II. The Land-Rover enjoyed something of a monopoly in former colonial areas of Africa and Asia until Japanese competition and exchange rates unfavorable to the British pound forced a marketing retreat. But now, when it is only marginally profitable, the Prime Minister's opponents have nearly succeeded in doing for Land-Rover what Mrs. Thatcher did for the Falkland Islands, making a smallish holding stand for Britain's will to resist foreign aggression in the industrial realm. In this case, the role of aggressor was attributed to General Motors or often, in newspaper headlines and radio bulletins, to simply ''the Americans.''
3/25/1986	G.M. VERIFIES CANADA PLANS	The General Motors Corporation confirmed today that it would spend $1.4 billion to renovate its Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plants for production of new lines of midsize cars and pickup trucks.
3/24/1986	Wheels for Lawyers	What kind of car does the typical American lawyer drive these days? Washingtonians, who have more lawyers available per capita than any other city-dwellers, would probably guess Cadillac among the domestic products and Mercedes among the imports.
3/17/1986	From the Assembly Line	Say ''America'' and a lot of images spring to mind. The Pilgrims, of course. Indians. The Great Plains. Mount Rushmore. Coca-Cola. Freeways. Malls.
3/15/1986	G.M. Allison Unit In Pratt Venture	The General Motors Corporation said that its Allison Gas Turbine division had formed a joint venture with the Pratt & Whitney unit of the United Technologies Corporation to develop propane engine and propulsion systems. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Allison Gas said a demonstration propulsion system would be produced for commercial and military transport markets in the 1990's.
3/15/1986	Allene T. Plaut Is Dead at 83; Ex-Associate Editor of Vogue	Allene Talmey Plaut, a former associate editor and columnist at Vogue magazine, died Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.
3/13/1986	A NEW WAY TO BUILD CARS	WHEN the General Motors Corporation opens assembly plants in Kansas City, Kan., and Doraville, Ga., in the fall of 1987 they will be largely missing a key element of traditional mass production: an assembly line. Instead, the company plans to assemble cars using hundreds of motorized, unmanned carriers called automated guided vehicles, which will carry a car as it goes through the assembly process. With the carriers, G.M. is breaking away from the auto industry's traditional method of operation, which is centered on a relentlessly moving assembly line that insures high productivity. But company officials describe the carriers as the heart of a new assembly system that they say will improve auto quality and greatly increase plant flexibility.
3/12/1986	GRUMMAN VEHICLE	The Grumman Corporation said that a vehicle it is building jointly with the General Motors Corporation had passed a critical test that might result in the awarding of a contract to build 99,150 delivery trucks for the United States Postal Service. A spokesman for the Postal Service said the agency's capital investment committee would review the test results this week.
3/11/1986	Fire Briefly Shuts G.M. Plant	Fire at a construction site at the General Motors assembly plant here slightly injured several workers and forced the plant to close for a while today, a spokesman for the company said. An employee fire brigade and firefighters from North Tarrytown and Tarrytown had the fire under control by 12:15 P.M. but the plant's 2,500 early-shift workers were sent home at 11:30 A.M., the spokesman said. The plant's second shift was not affected.
3/11/1986	G.M. SHUTTING DOWN 4 PLANTS	The General Motors Corporation has decided to halt production temporarily at four of its assembly plants, in an action that auto industry analysts described as the start of the first round of cuts needed to bring car supplies into line with sales demand. The closings will idle 10,600 workers. Auto analysts said they were not surprised by G.M.'s move in light of the rising inventories of some of its car lines in the last few months. While some said it appeared G.M. was moving away from their overproduction strategy of last year and early this year, most agreed that the industry, taxed by increased competition, was planning to cut production by 5 to 10 percent over all.
3/10/1986	G.M., CHRYSLER LAYOFFS	The General Motors Corporation said it would lay off 2,200 workers at its Pontiac Fiero sports-car assembly plant in Pontiac for a week because of rising dealer inventories. The Chrysler Corporation said that it would lay off 3,000 hourly workers for a week at its Sterling Heights plant so it could add equipment for a new line of subcompact cars, the Dodge Shadow-Plymouth Sundance cars.
3/7/1986	G.M. AND EGYPT	The General Motors Corporation said the Egyptian Government had accepted a proposal for a joint car-assembly venture with the state-owned Nasr Car Company. First-year production would be about 30,000 vehicles, with most of them to be sold in Egypt.
3/4/1986	G.M. TO BUY BACK $2 BILLION OF STOCK	The General Motors Corporation today announced a plan to buy back nearly $2 billion of its stock, including about one-third of the shares the auto maker issued late last year to acquire the Hughes Aircraft Company. Some analysts questioned the emphasis on the new class H shares rather than on G.M. common stock. ''I don't understand it,'' said Ronald Glantz, an auto industry analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''It's a little disappointing for G.M. stockholders.''
3/1/1986	WHY G.M. WANTS TINY LOTUS	There was excitement late in January in this quiet village 120 miles north of London when Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, swooped down in a helicopter for a tour of Group Lotus Cars P.L.C. Just five days earlier, on Jan. 22, G.M. announced that it had acquired 58 percent of the tiny sports car and engineering company for $18.5 million. In two packed hours, Mr. Smith tramped through the factory here where 450 workers make some 850 of the sleek high-performance cars each year, all by hand. He peeked into the lab, where Lotus creates advanced suspension systems, high-powered engines, composite materials and other innovations. He took a spin at 100 miles an hour-plus on the test track and, as Lotus's chief executive, Michael Kimberley, later put it, he went away pleased. ''Even though they're a large company, G.M.'s attitude to a small company like us is one of total understanding,'' Mr. Kimberley, 47 years old, said in an interview. ''There's an innovative spirit here, a lot of brain power, and you need a special environment to generate it. G.M. wishes to keep us a separate company with our own product identity. And they want us to build up our R.&D.''
2/28/1986	2 Sides End Trial Arguments On Recall of X Model Autos	The Government's landmark trial seeking the recall of 1980 X Model automobiles ended Wednesday and a Federal district judge now must decide whether the General Motors vehicles have dangerously unsafe brakes. Lawyers concluded final arguments with the nation's biggest auto maker asking for a dismissal, contending that the Justice Department had failed to prove its case. But Larry Moloney, the chief Government lawyer, told the court, ''General Motors turned its back on consumers under the safety act.''
2/28/1986	CHRYSLER AND FORD OFFERING INCENTIVES	The Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, responding to buying incentives introduced last week by the General Motors Corporation, today announced their own plans intended to attract new-car buyers. Ford, like G.M., is offering 9.9 percent financing on a wide range of cars and trucks. Chrysler, however, has shifted from offering either low-rate financing or a rebate, to only a rebate of $500 or $1,000 per car.
2/27/1986	Technology; Standardizing Automation	THE future of manufacturing is currently undergoing debugging at a General Motors truck assembly in Pontiac, Mich. G.M. Engineers are installing a factory communication system that should allow computers, process controllers, robots and other machines made by competing suppliers to communicate with each other. The Pontiac communication system, which will connect 21 types of devices from 13 different vendors, is the most ambitious attempt yet to knit together what manufacturers call the ''islands of automation'' that have popped up wherever they have invested in computers and modern machinery. It also represents the first large-scale test on a factory floor for Manufacturing Automation Protocol, or MAP, a growing collection of rules and standards for electronic communication in the factory. Without MAP or something like it, many of the potential benefits of automation are squandered. Manufacturers must customize existing communications systems, which is expensive and only partly effective, or assign human employees to run throughout plants transferring information between machines. That exchange of data could be done faultlessly in seconds if only there were standards for communications between machines from different manufacturers.
2/25/1986	NEW INCENTIVE PLAN OFFERED BY G.M.	Following the expiration of industrywide consumer incentive campaigns last week, the General Motors Corporation said today that it would offer 9.9 annual percentage rate financing to buyers of new cars and light trucks. The program covers about 80 percent of G.M.'s cars and trucks and applies to vehicles already in dealer inventories.
2/21/1986	G.M. PLANS OPTIONAL AIR BAGS FOR SOME CARS	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would offer a new air-bag system as optional equipment on selected 1988 automobile models. The air bags will be available on the driver's side only and will be designed to work with, not in place of, seat belts. Last fall the Ford Motor Company announced it would offer an air-bag system on its Tempo and Topaz models beginning with cars produced next month. The option is available for $850. Mercedes-Benz became the first automobile maker to make the system standard equipment in cars sold in the United States, starting with 1986 models.
2/20/1986	G.M. AIDE CHALLENGES APARTHEID	An American company operating in South Africa directly challenged apartheid today, saying it would offer financial and legal support to its employees who defy a law that calls for racial segregation of beaches. Bob White, managing director of the General Motors Corporation's subsidiary at Port Elizabeth, said in a letter to the editor of a newspaper there that his company found the city's beach segregation ordinance ''odious.'' Mr. White said he wrote the letter without consulting the corporate parent's headquarters in Detroit. He said G.M. would provide lawyers and money to defend in court any of its employees accused of violating the ordinance. In many parts of South Africa beaches are segregated by race, as are buses and restrooms.
2/18/1986	G.M. BUILDS ADVANCED ENGINE	The General Motors Corporation announced today that it had developed an advanced technology four-cylinder engine with performance exceeding most of the V-8 engines in use today. The new engine, called the ''Quad Four,'' will be installed in some Oldsmobile and Buick models starting with 1988 models.
2/17/1986	Clues to Succession In G.M.'s Reshuffle	When the General Motors Corporation announced a major executive reshuffle recently, most of the attention focused on Lloyd E. Reuss, 49 years old, and Robert C. Stempel, 51, the newly appointed executive vice presidents of the automotive giant. That is not surprising, since it is widely felt within the automotive industry that one of the two men will succeed F. James McDonald as president of G.M. when Mr. McDonald retires next year. But there were a number of other changes one or two notches down in G.M.'s hierarchy that give some clues as to who the other contenders for the company's top executive spots are, and who will be among the next generation of senior management. One key appointment was the promotion of William E. Hoglund from the presidency of the Saturn Corporation to head of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group and a corporate group vice presidency. The advancement keeps Mr. Hoglund just a step behind Mr. Stempel and Mr. Ruess, who were once his co-equals when he was vice president in charge of the Pontiac division and Mr. Stempel was managing Chevrolet and Mr. Reuss was at Buick.
2/16/1986	MAGIC OF CORVETTE LASTS TO THIS DAY	WHEN Chevrolet turned its first Corvette loose in 1953, we fans got pretty excited, particularly we teen-age fans. I remember my first glimpse, outside a dealership in Pennsylvania. Chevy's gem was glinting in the sun, shiny white fiberglass, chrome mesh over the headlights, Blue Flame engine nestling under the hood. I loved it, and it always seemed a sure bet that I'd wind up with one or another of the four generations that have followed that first Vette. Somehow, I never did buy one. But the allure remains.
2/4/1986	G.M. NET RISES 42.5% IN QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation today reported a 42.5 percent jump in profits in the fourth quarter. Net income rose to $1.25 billion in the period, up from $877 million a year earlier, when the company was plagued with labor disputes. Auto industry analysts said the results were in line with expectations. Lower-than-anticipated pretax earnings were more than offset by lower tax rates and record earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, principally the General Motors Acceptance Corporation.
2/4/1986	BL DISCUSSING SALE OF UNITS TO G.M.	BL P.L.C., the state-owned vehicle maker, is holding talks that have reached an advanced stage with the General Motors Corporation about the sale of the financially ailing company's truck and four-wheel-drive vehicle divisions, the Government said today. Speaking in the House of Commons, Paul Channon, Trade and Industry Secretary, said, ''Discussions are at an advanced stage, but a number of important issues remain to be settled.'' The announcement brought attacks from opposition politicians and union officials. John Smith, a Labor Party leader, called the pending selloff plans a ''dreadful and shameful British retreat.'' Then, he asked rhetorically, ''Is nothing not for sale?''
2/3/1986	G.M. to Keep Dealer System	The General Motors Corporation has decided against any radical changes in its dealership system when it starts selling its Saturn cars near the end of the decade, according to dealers and company officials. Officials of the National Automobile Dealers Association, which is holding its annual meeting here, said they had received assurances that Saturn cars would be sold through franchised dealers, in much the same way all of G.M.'s cars and trucks are sold.
1/29/1986	Reds Pitcher Loses Star Role	Marge Schott was a Chevrolet dealer long before she bought the Cincinnati Reds. This is not news - except, apparently, to Tom Browning, who won 20 games as a rookie pitcher for the Reds last year.
1/23/1986	G.M. Acquires 59.7% of Lotus	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had bought a majority interest in Lotus, the British producer of high-performance sports cars. G.M. acquired 59.7 percent of Group Lotus shares for about $20 million, company officials said.
1/23/1986	G.M. SHIFTS OPERATIONS IN EUROPE	The General Motors Corporation, in an apparent effort to reverse mounting losses, today announced a wide-reaching reorganization of its European operations. In simultaneous announcements in Detroit and Frankfurt, the company said it was creating a central European organization, called General Motors Europe-Passenger Cars, in Zurich. It will coordinate all of G.M.'s European operations, particularly Opel of West Germany and Vauxhall of Britain. G.M. appointed Ferdinand Beickler, the 63-year-old head of Adam Opel A.G., its big West German subsidiary, to head the centralized unit. At a news conference in Frankfurt, Mr. Beickler said the changes were aimed at ''more strongly combining'' research, styling and production throughout Europe.
1/23/1986	Technology; 'Intelligent' Auto Controls	TUNING a car radio, particularly today's button-bedecked models, can be an uncomfortable, even dangerous, undertaking on the highway. Drivers have to take their eyes off the road and look toward the middle of the dashboard to change stations or balance the sound. Pontiac has come up with an innovative answer to the problem. All the buttons to control the radio on its sporty 6000 STE model are inside the hub of the steering wheel. A driver can adjust the radio without having to look away from the road - or even move a hand far from the wheel.
1/21/1986	G.M.'s Class H Stock Buyback	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would purchase at least one million shares of its class H common stock outstanding before the end of 1986 to fulfill expected requirements of employee benefit plans. The company said the exact number of shares to be purchased would depend on employee involvement in various stock plans.
1/19/1986	A LITTLE HELP FOR G.M. AND FORD	Ignoring the complaints of consumer groups and the Chrysler Corporation, the Department of Transportation said last week that it would propose retaining for an additional two years the lower fuel-economy standards it granted General Motors and Ford last summer. Diane Steed, who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the fuel-economy requirements for 1987 and 1988 cars - set by legislation enacted in 1975, when memories of gasoline lines were still fresh - appeared to be too tough.
1/17/1986	G.M. Truck Plan	The General Motors Corporation said it would close its Pontiac truck assembly plant for one week beginning Monday to reduce inventories.
1/17/1986	Tutu Meets Chairmen Of G.M. and Burroughs	Desmond M. Tutu, the Anglican Bishop of Johannesburg who is a leader in the fight against South Africa's policy of strict racial separation, met today with Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, and W. Michael Blumenthal, chairman of the Burroughs Corporation, for an hourlong ''exchange of views.'' The meeting was held just before Bishop Tutu addressed more than 2,000 business executives and civic leaders at the Economic Club, one of the nation's most prominent business forums.
1/17/1986	Advertising; G.M. Offering Sequel On George Washington	If it's O.K. for Rambo and O.K. for Rocky it is certainly O.K. for George Washington. Sequels are the issue and a sequel our first President will have, courtesy of General Motors. G.M., which spent about $14 million to be the sole sponsor of the eight-hour special on Washington that ran on the CBS-TV Network in April 1983, will be back with four more hours, it is hoped, on two nights in September.
1/12/1986	ROGER SMITH'S TROUBLED SECOND ACT	WHEN Roger B. Smith announced the restructuring of the General Motors Corporation in January 1984, he was exultant. The plan called for folding fractious divisions into two super groups which, the G.M. chairman said, would give the giant automaker ''a more effective method for designing, engineering, manufacturing, assembling and selling cars.'' Two years later, although Mr. Smith says his plan is on track, the much-ballyhooed shift in strategy apparently has not begun to pay off. America's biggest automaker remains prosperous enough, but cracks are beginning to appear below the surface as G.M. struggles with the most intensely competitive market of the post-war years. The 60-year-old Mr. Smith is gambling heavily that the billions he has been spending to move General Motors into high-tech auto production will eventually make his company the low-cost auto producer. But right now he is going through a difficult passage. G.M. today is spending more to make each car than any of its competitors, its American market share has shrunk substantially, profits are down, and Ford and Chrysler are moving aggressively into a market that G.M.'s highly profitable Buicks and Cadillacs once dominated.
1/10/1986	G.M. Job Cuts	The General Motors Corporation said it would lay off 4,100 workers temporarily in Wilmington, Del., and 30 jobs would be eliminated at a Detroit toolmaking shop. The Wilmington assembly plant, which had been making large Chevrolet and Oldsmobile cars, will be retooled for $300 million for a smaller front-wheel drive Chevrolet line currently code-named the L-car. G.M.'s Linden, N.J., plant was closed in August for retooling to produce the car.
1/3/1986	G.M. Car Import	The General Motors Corporation said that the subcompact economy car it will begin importing next year from South Korea will be called the Pontiac Le Mans. The tiny car is scheduled to be imported in 1987 as a 1988 model. G.M.'s Pontiac division has not given dates or said how many cars would be imported, although industry sources said the number might exceed 100,000 annually. It was designed by G.M.'s West German subsidiary, Adam Opel A.G. Daewoo Group Ltd., which is 50 percent owned by G.M., will build the car.
1/2/1986	TRANSMISSIONS IN SOME G.M. CARS ARE DEFECTIVE, SAFETY GROUP SAYS	An automobile safety group said today that automatic four-speed transmissions in many General Motors cars and trucks were defective. The company's ''new generation of automatic transmissions beginning in 1982 and later model large cars and trucks are plagued with problems rivaling G.M.'s infamous Type THM-200 automatic of the late 1970's,'' said the Center for Auto Safety. But Dan Howell, a spokesman for the center, also said that the transmissions were not a major safety hazard.
12/31/1985	Market Place;   G.M. May Lag Behind Rivals	AS Detroit's Big Three auto makers head into 1986, stock market prospects for Chrysler and Ford are running ahead of those for General Motors, according to most Wall Street analysts. Reflecting these judgments, shares of both Ford and Chrysler traded recently at record prices on the New York Stock Exchange. Ford and Chrysler are selling at no more than four times their trailing 12-month earnings. And both companies have announced stock repurchase programs - a strategy that appeals to investors, since it enhances per-share profits.
12/27/1985	FORD MATCHES 7.9% G.M. RATE	The General Motors Corporation opened a new round of automobile pricing competition today by announcing 7.9 percent financing on some of its cars and trucks, and the Ford Motor Company quickly followed suit with the same incentives. G.M., the nation's No. 1 auto maker, announced it would offer the lower rates to consumers on about 40 percent of its vehicles. Ford announced a few hours later that it, too, would offer 7.9 percent financing on about 40 percent of its cars. ''Essentially, it is a competitive response to help us maintain our sales momentum,'' said John Seig, a spokesman for Ford, the second-largest domestic auto maker.
12/24/1985	7.9% G.M. LOAN RATE EXPECTED	The General Motors Corporation will offer a 7.9 percent interest rate later this week as an incentive to increase flagging car sales, auto industry sources reported today. Several G.M. dealers said the incentives, to be announced Thursday, would be offered on about half the automobile giant's product line, including the Chevrolet Nova, the product of G.M.'s venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation. The program is expected to extend through February. If there was any surprise in the G.M. plan, it was the attention the incentive campaign will draw to the slow-selling Nova, a key part of G.M.'s effort to hold on to part of the small-car market through various alliances with Japanese car makers.
12/22/1985	LUXURY GALORE IN NEW RIVIERA	BACK when we were kids, learning to tell which car was which, Buick was the place to start. There were those portholes in the fenders for one thing. There was that distinctive hood ornament for another. And there was the Riviera, the first of the ''hardtop convertibles,'' later known simply as hardtop coupes. That was 1949, and the first Riviera, a two-door without window posts, was indeed a coup. Since then, the cars have been many things, fat and thin. They have been refined at times, made awkward at others. When Chrysler successfully brought back the ragtop several years ago, Riviera was right there, hot on its heels.
12/15/1985	G.M.'s CHIEF COUNSEL: ELMER W. JOHNSON;   LIMITING THE AUTO GIANT'S LIABILITY	ELMER W. JOHNSON, the top lawyer for the General Motors Corporation, is no stuffy, single-minded corporate counsel. He once prefaced a speech to some G.M. employees with a blaring trumpet solo. He preached a sermon on economics and God's justice at the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. His reading taste runs to Plato and John Stuart Mill; his writings carry such titles as ''Corporate Leadership and the Judeo-Christian Vision.'' Yet despite his nonconformist streak, Mr. Johnson has a down-to-earth, practical side as well. He has counseled corporate giants, including Amoco, Westinghouse and International Harvester, on business matters that went far deeper than technical legal issues. It was he who helped the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company investigate allegations of illegal political contributions and overseas payments in the post-Watergate era - indeed, he helped send one Firestone officer to jail for pocketing corporate funds. And it was he who suggested a complex convertible debenture formula that enabled the Federal Signal Corporation to get past a financing impasse in merger negotiations. ''Unlike many lawyers, Elmer is very decisive,'' said Harold L. Henderson, Firestone's former general counsel. ''He doesn't just point out problems; he is very good at laying out a constructive program, too.''
12/6/1985	Ford Adopts Incentives	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would offer sales incentives on one line of subcompact cars, adopting a stance similar to that of the General Motors Corporation and avoiding the wider incentives being offered by Chrysler Corporation. Ford said its Ford Motor Credit Company subsidiary would offer financing with a 7.9 percent interest rate on the Escort and EXP models and the Mercury Lynx.
12/5/1985	G.M. OFFERS NEW SALES INCENTIVE	The General Motors Corporation today announced a limited sales incentive plan, offering 8.5 percent financing on one line of compact cars. The action by G.M. comes a week after the Chrysler Corporation offered 8.6 percent financing or rebates of up to $1,000 on the smaller half of its product lineup. There has been no action as yet from the Ford Motor Company, and a Ford official said no announcement was planned for today.
12/2/1985	Berger Stone Adding Auto Dealers' Groups	Berger Stone & Partners, long involved with advertising for Chevrolet dealer associations, has just added two more of the dealers' groups to its client list, bringing the total to nine with billings of about $15 million. The newcomers are the Central Louisiana and the Central Pennsylvania Dealers Associations.
11/30/1985	G.M. SETTLES A 1966 BIAS CASE	In a settlement reached in a 19-year-old lawsuit over racial discrimination, the General Motors Corporation has agreed to pay $239,000 to 226 current and former black employees at its plant in Lakewood, Ga. The award for most of the plaintiffs is set at $250 each, but some will receive up to $7,100 under an order signed earlier this week by Judge Orinda Evans in the Federal District Court here.
11/29/1985	DETROIT EXPERIMENTING WITH THE PLASTIC LOOK	When Detroit decides to design a more expensive version of a popular car, it usually means that the new model will have a few bits of additional chrome and a plusher interior. Pontiac's plan for the new Fiero GT, a high-priced offspring of the successful Fiero two-seat sports car, was dramatically different, however. Thanks to the Fiero's unique construction - a plastic skin of outer body panels attached to an independent steel ''space frame'' - the General Motors Corporation division was able to retool quickly and at relatively low cost to change the styling from a chopped-off ''notchback'' look to a more streamlined ''fastback.'' G.M. officials and many others in the auto industry are convinced that clearly differentiated styling approaches are going to be critical to the future success of specialty cars like the Fiero, and family cars as well. And, they say, plastic is going to be critical to that effort.
11/28/1985	Gift to Kennedy Center	General Motors has pledged $1 million to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to help begin its $42 million national fund-raising campaign. Roger B. Smith, the chairman of G.M., said, ''We hope that our gift encourages other corporations to generously support the center's campaign.''
11/27/1985	Perot Termed G.M. Dissenter	H. Ross Perot was the director who voted against the General Motors Corporation's acquisition of the Hughes Aircraft Company, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry trade journal. Other sources in the auto industry confirmed the account.
11/21/1985	Slow Buick Sales Lead to Layoffs	The General Motors Corporation will lay off 1,723 workers in Michigan because of falling demand for the Buick Regal midsized car, the nation's largest car maker said.
11/19/1985	U.S. IS FACED BY THREE LAWSUITS TO RESTORE TIGHT AUTO FUEL RULES	The Reagan Administration's decision to roll back Federal fuel efficiency standards for new cars is being challenged in court even as the two largest car companies prepare strategies so they can comply with the relaxed requirements. The court actions are the latest move in a 15-year controversy over whether the Federal Government should require Detroit to make cars that use less gasoline. They come less than 90 days after the Administration eased the average fuel standard for the fleets of 1986 models to 26 miles a gallon from 27.5 miles a gallon. In three suits last week, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston, the state of California and a coalition of consumer groups sought reinstatement of the tougher standards. The cases were filed in the United States Court of Appeals in Washington.
11/15/1985	G.M. Price Rises	The General Motors Corporation said that some models in its newest line of 1986 cars would cost nearly $4,000 more than the 1985 versions. The sports-luxury cars, sharing the same basic body and platforms, are the Cadillac Seville, with a suggested retail price of $26,756, 15 percent over the 1985 price; the Cadillac Eldorado, $24,251, up nearly 16 percent; the Oldsmobile Toronado, $19,418, up 15.6 percent, and the Buick Riviera, $19,831, up 18.7 percent. Clifford Merriott, a GM spokesman, said the increases were justified because the company redesigned the cars ''from roof to road and from front to back.''
11/14/1985	G.M. GIVES DETAILS ON HUGHES	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it expected to complete the acquisition of the Hughes Aircraft Company before the end of the year. G.M. also said it would alter the way it reports the earnings of subsidiaries with their own class of stock. In a solicitation statement issued in connection with the acquisition, G.M. also disclosed that the privately held Hughes had experienced an earnings decline this year after five years of steady growth. The statement contained many financial details about both Hughes and the auto maker's own Delco Electronics operations. The Hughes and Delco units are to be combined to form the new subsidiary, the G.M. Hughes Electronics Corporation.
11/13/1985	Details Expected On G.M.-Hughes	The General Motors Corporation will release details of its proposed acquisition of Hughes Aircraft Company on Wednesday, according to sources on Wall Street. G.M. has scheduled a news conference in New York to be conducted by Donald J. Atwood, an executive vice president of G.M. and the president-designate of G.M.-Hughes Electronics Corporation. Separately, G.M. said it would spend $135 million to convert its plant in Lakewood, Ga., to build rear-wheel-drive, full-size cars. Employment at the plant, which had been producing small cars, will increase by about 900 people, G.M. said.
11/9/1985	HELPING UNHAPPY CAR OWNER	CONSUMERS were awarded nearly $2 million from January 1984 to February 1985 under a car-repair arbitration program administered by the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. The program was begun under a 1983 consent order between General Motors and the Federal Trade Commission. It allows Better Business Bureaus nationwide to seek reimbursement or repairs from General Motors for people dissatisfied with certain components of the company's cars or light trucks. The order settled a 1980 complaint charging that General Motors failed to notify customers about serious problems with the following components in some cars: THM 200 transmissions (1976 to 1983 models); camshafts and lifters in 305- and 350-cubic-inch Chevrolet gasoline engines (1974 to 1983 models), and fuel injection pumps and fuel injectors in 350-cubic-inch Oldsmobile diesel engines (1978 to 1983 models).
11/8/1985	G.M. PAYMENT ACCORD ENDS TENNESSEE ANNEXING DISPUTE	The General Motors Corporation will pay no property taxes on its $3.5 billion Saturn automobile plant, but it will make payments to the county in which the plant will be built, officials said in announcing the plan today. The agreement between G.M. and Maury County officials calls for a first-year payment of $7.5 million, more than all 51,000 county residents now pay in property taxes, and divides the revenues among the county, Spring Hill and two other cities. Payments are to continue until the year 2025.
11/7/1985	G.M. to End Automatic Raises	Ending a 37-year tradition, the General Motors Corporation is notifying most of its white-collar work force that beginning Jan. 1 it is eliminating their automatic cost-of-living increases. In the future any increase in salary would be based mostly on performance, although length of service and other factors will be considered, according to a letter the auto maker mailed to most of its salaried employees last weekend. About 125,000 workers in North America will be affected by the change.
10/25/1985	FORD ACQUIRES A STAKE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	The Ford Motor Company, following the example of the General Motors Corporation, announced today that it had purchased minority interests in two companies that specialize in the development of artificial intelligence computer systems. Ford said it would invest up to $28 million for up to 10 percent equity in each of two companies - the Inference Corporation of Los Angeles and the Carnegie Group Inc. of Pittsburgh. Both companies are privately owned. The investment also includes contracts for systems development.
10/24/1985	Tennessee Town Delays Plan to Annex G.M. Land	The Board of Aldermen of this city of 1,100 people voted Tuesday to delay annexing adjacent land owned by the General Motors Corporation, which threatened Monday to pull its $3.5 billion Saturn automobile plant out of the area if the annexation went through. Mayor George Jones said after a brief board meeting that the city was negotiating with officials of Maury County to try to get a share of payments in lieu of property taxes that General Motors is to pay the county.
10/24/1985	WEEKEND VOTE SET	The United Automobile Workers and the Chrysler Corporation reached a tentative contract early this morning that erases most of the concessions the union granted in Chrysler's financial crisis of 1979-82. If members approve the contract in voting over the weekend, the week-old strike by 70,000 workers could end Monday. The agreement, which came after a 42-hour bargaining session at Chrysler headquarters here, provides for immediate bonuses of over $2,000 for each active Chrysler worker and $1,000 for each retired worker, as well as pay and benefit increases to match workers at General Motors and Ford. $1 Billion in Labor Costs The raise in the first year is to be 2.25 percent. In the second year workers will not get an increase in base pay but will get 2.25 percent paid in a lump sum. In the third year, the raise will be 3 percent.
10/23/1985	NET INCOME RISES 23.9% AT G.M.	The General Motors Corporation today reported a 23.9 percent gain in profits, but a costly sales incentive program and ambitious capital spending left the No. 1 auto maker with an operating loss in the third quarter. G.M.'s net income was $516.5 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with $416.8 million, or $1.31 a share, during a troubled third quarter last year. However, this year's high costs created an operating loss of $21 million, compared with operating income of $307 million a year ago. The last time General Motors reported an operating loss was in the third quarter of 1982, when it had net earnings of $129 million.
10/18/1985	Topics;   Shots Felt Round the World; We Are Driven	Put yourself in the position of Japan, whose turn to be host for the annual economic summit meeting comes up next spring. You want to put your best foot forward, but your guests think your feet are too big.
10/17/1985	BOTH SIDES OPTIMISTIC ON SOLUTION	More than 80,000 Chrysler workers in the United States and Canada went on strike today, seeking wages and benefits parallel to those at General Motors and Ford. Union talks with the Chrysler Corporation, the nation's third-largest automaker failed to produce agreement before the contract expired at midnight. Negotiations continued today despite the strike and leaders on both sides of the bargaining table expressed hope for an early settlement. But when negotiations broke off for the night about 8:30, union officials said there was no agreement in sight. The dispute idled more than 70,000 workers in this country and 10,000 in Canada. The union leaders said that committees dealing with some issues would continue discussions tonight and that talks by the entire union and management bargaining teams would resume in the morning.
10/12/1985	G.M. AND FIAT HOLD TALKS ON VENTURE	The General Motors Corporation and Fiat S.p.A., the big Italian auto company, are conducting negotiations on a possible combined venture, a spokesman for G.M. said today. He added that the talks, however, did not involve joint production of automobiles. ''There have been discussions between G.M. and Fiat regarding possible business arrangements in non-automotive areas,'' said Jack R. Harned, a G.M. spokesman. The company declined to specify the areas, but there was speculation in the auto industry that the two companies might pool technology in the production of automated manufacturing equipment.
10/11/1985	G.M. to Expand Its Plant Upstate	The General Motors Corporation said it was planning a $340 million expansion program to make two new kinds of car engines at the Tonawanda engine plant. Officials, however, said they could not immediately tell how many new jobs it would create.
10/10/1985	Ford, AMC to Cut Some Loan Rates	The Ford Motor Company and the American Motors Corporation said today that they would offer financing at below-market rates on some vehicles, in response to a similar plan announced earlier this week by the General Motors Corporation. All three companies are offering to finance some vehicles at 8.8 percent; most lending institutions have interest rates of 10 percent to 14 percent on auto loans.
10/10/1985	G.M. Landmark	The General Motors Corporation's elaborate 15-story world headquarters building here has been dedicated as a national historic landmark by Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel. ''This building is important to the development of Detroit, to the nation and, in fact, because of the company it has housed, to the world,'' Mr. Hodel declared before unveiling a plaque on Tuesday.
10/7/1985	Detroit's Pressure On Rates	PARADE magazine, the Sunday newspaper supplement with 30 million circulation, has gotten a 25-page order from Chevrolet. And that is the best automotive order the publication has ever gotten. Moderately elated Carlo Vittorini, its publisher, believes that his special automotive issue of Parade on Sept. 29, the first of its kind, ''helped to trigger'' Chevy's interest. He estimated that at the open rate such a purchase would cost between $6.5 million and $7 million, but, he added, using a familiar phrase in the trade, ''there were attractive discounts.''
10/3/1985	G.M. Considers 2d Saturn Plant	The General Motors Corporation is considering building a second plant for its Saturn Corporation subsidiary and importing cars for sale by its dealers, according to Roger B. Smith, the G.M. chairman. The Saturn Corporation was planned by G.M. to build competitively priced small cars in the United States by cutting production costs, which are about $2,000 a car more than for the Japanese.
9/26/1985	G.M. to Expand Michigan Plant	The General Motors Corporation said that it would spend more than $500 million to modernize and expand its metal stamping plant in Grand Rapids, Mich. The move is a part of G.M.'s continuing program to update its existing facilities.
9/26/1985	VICTOR POTAMKIN, THE SALESMAN	VICTOR POTAMKIN wants to sell you a car. He would prefer to sell you a Cadillac - he wouldn't buy any other kind of car himself, he says - but he would also be happy to sell you a Subaru, a Dodge, a Volkswagen, a Renault, an Isuzu, a Lincoln or a Toyota from one of the 28 dealerships he owns with his two sons, Robert and Alan. ''We'll sell you a car for a $100 profit,'' he said. ''We won't let you go.'' Nearly 40 years after he became a car dealer in his native Philadelphia, and 13 years after he opened Potamkin Cadillac in New York, Mr. Potamkin, a silver-haired 74-year-old who bounds up the four flights to his office every day, still finds it exciting to sell cars. This year he has been opening new dealerships along the Eastern Seaboard at the rate of one a month, and next month he will take over a large Chrysler dealership in Manhattan.
9/17/1985	G.M. Selling Plant To California City	The General Motors Corporation, which closed its auto-assembly plant here three and a half years ago and furloughed about 4,200 workers, will sell the facility to the city for $15 million, far below its appraised value of $40 million. Mayor William Dewitt announced the details of the sale, saying the 90-acre plant was sold below value so South Gate could attract new businesses and jobs.
9/16/1985	G.M. CAR BUILT IN JAPAN WINS E.P.A. TEST ON FUEL MILEAGE	A model of the Chevrolet Sprint won the Government's top fuel mileage rating for 1986 cars and was the first car to score 60 miles a gallon on the highway, the Environmental Protection Agency said today. The Sprint ER, a Japanese-built minicar that replaced the Honda Civic Coupe HF at the top spot it held for the last two years, gets 55 miles a gallon in city driving, according to annual test results released by the agency. The Civic HF last year was rated at 49 miles a gallon in the city, 54 miles a gallon on the highway. This year, the best Civic HF got ratings of 52 miles a gallon in the city and 57 on the highway.
9/13/1985	Job Security Sought By U.A.W. at Chrysler	The United Automobile Workers will seek job security provisions from the Chrysler Corporation similar to those the union obtained from the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, union leaders say.
9/12/1985	Cadillac Predicts Only Nominal Gain	Cadillac will be unable to take advantage of the rising fortunes of the luxury car market in the 1986 model year and is predicting only a nominal increase in sales, company officials said today. Executives of the General Motors Corporation division, at a press preview of 1986 models, cited increased competition from Lincoln, Chrysler and imports and the slow start-up of the Detroit factory producing its all-new Eldorado and Seville models.
9/11/1985	G.M. Hughes Accounting	The General Motors Corporation, at the insistence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will report two earnings figures for its new G.M. Hughes subsidiary, company officials said today. The auto company, which is in the process of acquiring the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion, is establishing a new category of stock, G.M. H shares, that will be backed by the earnings of the new subsidiary.
9/7/1985	Rostenkowski Meets Executives on Taxes	A group of the nation's elite corporate leaders, including the heads of I.B.M., General Motors and R. J. Reynolds, flew to the Chicago area today to meet with Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to discuss the status of tax revision and to convey their views. After the hourlong meeting held at the headquarters of Dart & Kraft, Mr. Rostenkowsi said the most ''sensitive'' issue discussed was the taxation of fringe benefits. ''The thread that runs through all the material that we've discussed is that we'd like to see the business community make decisions based on good business as opposed to how they can shelter dollars to avoid paying taxes,'' Mr. Rostenkowski said.
9/6/1985	Saturn's Pay Pattern	White-collar workers in the General Motors Corporation's Saturn subsidiary will receive smaller salaries but more incentive pay than elsewhere in G.M., a company spokesman said today. The new car is to be built in Tennessee.
9/5/1985	New G.M. Shop	Officials at the General Motors Corporation have announced plans to spend $240 million for a new auto painting and finishing shop here. The decision to build the facility next to an existing plant, where Oldsmobiles and Chevrolets are assembled, protects some 4,000 jobs and creates more than 1,000 construction jobs, officials said. The investment and improvements at the Framingham G.M. plant, the only auto factory in New England, are designed to bring G.M.'s painting operations into compliance with Federal air-quality standards.
8/31/1985	G.M. SETS 3% AVERAGE PRICE RISE	The General Motors Corporation today announced price increases on its 1986 model cars that it said ranged from 2.4 percent to 3.8 percent and averaged 3 percent across its model lineup. The announcement followed an earlier indication in July that the world's largest auto maker was planning price increases substantially above those of previous years. It raised the price of the 1985 models by 2.3 percent and the 1984 models by 2 percent.
8/30/1985	G.M. Layoffs Begin At Jersey Plant	The General Motors Corporation said that the layoffs of 4,800 workers at its Linden, N.J., auto assembly plant would begin Friday to allow the factory to be retooled for a new line of cars.
8/26/1985	7.7% RATE IS LURING CAR BUYERS	Ten days after the General Motors Corporation began offering special 7.7 percent financing on most of its 1985 models still in stock, G.M. dealers around the country are reporting dramatic increases in customer visits to showrooms and are anticipating similar increases in sales. Dealers for the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and the American Motors Corporation, which followed G.M. with special incentives of their own last week, are also reporting increases in showroom traffic as customers flock to check out cars before the incentives expire when new 1986 models arrive in October. But many automobile industry analysts say the incentives - Detroit's most extensive in years - will steal many sales that would likely have been made in October anyway and will not increase the domestic makers' share of the car market. And, analysts say, the special offerings may end up forcing the domestic makers to offer another round of incentives later on.
8/24/1985	Layoffs at G.M.	The General Motors Corporation said its Truck and Bus Group will lay off about 1,100 hourly workers next month because of softening demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks and city buses.
8/23/1985	A.M.C. Cuts Rate To 7.5 Percent	The American Motors Corporation lowered its discount car financing offer from 8.5 percent, to 7.5 percent, to compete with recent incentives offered by the Big Three auto makers.
8/20/1985	Ford, Chrysler Loan Rates Cut	The nations second-and third-largest auto manufacturers, following the General Motors Corporation, yesterday lowered their rates on loans for most of their remaining 1985 model cars and trucks. The Ford Motor Company said that it would match G.M.'s subsidized 7.7 percent rate on loans to purchase its 1985 vehicles.
8/16/1985	G.M. OFFERS 7.7% LOANS ON '85 LINE	The General Motors Corporation, which has been losing market share since late last year, said today that it would offer 7.7 percent financing on most of its 1985 cars and trucks. The rate is the lowest ever offered by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, G.M.'s financing arm, and is about the same rate at which the giant financial institution now sells its securities in the commercial paper market. ''What G.M. is having is a classic Macy's-style inventory clearance sale,'' said Scott Merlis, an auto analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''There are three factors that led to the program: sluggish demand, more imported cars and the recent car haulers strike. The company has to switch to its 1986 models and dealers have to clear out their showrooms,'' he added.
8/14/1985	TOUGH CANADIAN STANCE IN CHRYSLER BEGINNING	Canadian auto workers told Chrysler Canada Ltd. today that they would insist on raises to make their compensation equal to that of employees at General Motors and Ford. ''The days of concessions at Chrysler are behind us,'' Bob White, director of the Canadian Union of Automobile Workers, told a press conference. The adamancy of Mr. White could presage a serious threat to the resurgent Chrysler Corporation, which has pinned much of its future on its popular Canadian-made mini-van. The only plant that assembles the mini-van is in Windsor, Ontario.
8/11/1985	SPRING HILL WAS FAMOUS BEFORE SATURN	To the Editor: Your July 27 news article about Spring Hill, Tenn., and the General Motors Saturn plant to be built there mentions its turn-of-the-century renown as a phosphate boom town, but omits the ''Spring Hill Affair'' of the Civil War. On the night of Nov. 29, 1864, Gen. John M. Schofield of the Union marched a retreating army of 29,000 men through Spring Hill, past a sleeping Confederate army of 40,000 men under Gen. John Bell Hood.
8/8/1985	A Dark Day for U.S. Workers Is Dawning at Toyota-G.M. Plant	To the Editor: A. H. Raskin heralds the opening of a new era in labor-management relations in the start-up of production at the Fremont, Calif., auto plant jointly managed by Toyota and General Motors (''An Industrial Breakthrough,'' Op-Ed, July 23). But those familiar with both Toyota and G.M. as trade unionists have a different view. Is the price of cooperation the permanent loss of jobs to speedup and automation? Of the original 6,000 workers employed at the plant, the new company, New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., will hire only 2,500. And those only after careful screening of attendance records, disciplinary incidents and attitudes toward labor-management relations. Nummi has pledged only that a majority plus one of these 2,500 will come from the old union shop.
8/8/1985	G.M. Pact Challenged By Anti-Union Group	The National Right to Work Committee today filed a legal challenge to the agreement between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers for G.M.'s new Saturn plant in Tennessee.
8/6/1985	Late-July Car Sales Off 10.5%	Sales of domestically produced new cars declined 10.5 percent in the last 10 days of July, the manufacturers reported today. For the entire month, sales were down 11 percent from July 1984. In the meantime, sales of imported cars increased almost 25 percent over last year's level, capturing about 29 percent of the American market.
8/6/1985	G.M. Picks Leaders For Its Hughes Unit	The General Motors Corporation yesterday announced a number of changes among its top executives in preparation for the company's planned acquisition of the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion. Donald J. Atwood was named to become president of the G.M. Hughes Electronics Corporation, a subsidiary to consist of the Delco Electronics division as well as Hughes. Mr. Atwood, who is 61 years old, has been an executive vice president of G.M. and a director since January 1984. Since 1981 Mr. Atwood has headed a number of operational divisions, including the company's truck and bus division, its power products and defense group and its mechanical and electrical components businesses.
8/4/1985	SATURN DIVISION FINDS A HOME IN THE HEARTLAND	In the seven months after General Motors Corporation announced its plan to create a subsidiary to build cars in a new way, 25 state governors came courting to the northern suburbs of Detroit. Each hoped to return home with a promise from G.M. to build the new Saturn Corporation's $3.5 billion manufacturing complex in their state. Saturn found a home last week in Spring Hill, Tenn., 45 miles south of Nashville, in the center of a state that is roughly in the center of the country's population. Gov. Lamar Alexander, who had refrained from making the trip to Detroit, said the choice confirmed Tennessee's desirability as a home for new industries. G.M. said the location would minimize the shipping costs when the cars go on sale. What's good for Tennessee is also good for General Motors, or so the company hopes. The world's largest industrial corporation expects Saturn to make it number one again in image as well as helping it to hold on as number one in size. By using new technology, new labor-management relations and a new operating style, the company seeks to overcome the cost advantage of $2,000 or more per vehicle that Japanese companies hold in the production of small cars. G.M. already imports some small cars from Japan and makes others in California in a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corporation.
8/4/1985	TENNESSEE'S GOVERNOR WINNING POLITICAL FRIENDS, AND INDUSTRY	At the Gridiron dinner in Washington last March, and again at a United Way banquet in Memphis in April, Gov. Lamar Alexander made his quiet pitch to the General Motors chairman, Roger B. Smith: Put your new Saturn automotive plant in Tennessee and take on the Japanese head to head. ''I told him that, with the big Nissan manufacturing plant here, Tennessee offered the most competitive environment anywhere,'' said Mr. Alexander, a Republican who will take over next week as chairman of the National Governors Association. ''That's what the American auto makers have said they always wanted: a level playing field to show they could beat the Japanese.'' The General Motors Corporation's decision to put its $5 billion Saturn plant in Tennessee, announced Monday, is a feather in the cap of Mr. Alexander, who has emerged in recent years as one of the most popular Governors in the region, and a figure of rising stature in national Republican ranks.
8/3/1985	PATENTS; New G.M. Way to Paint Cars	A NEW method of using robots to paint automobile bodies was patented this week for the General Motors Corporation. The system is already being used in the Baltimore truck assembly plant for painting the new G.M. mini-van.
8/3/1985	BOLD G.M. PACT DRAWS PRAISE, AND SOME CAVEATS	Experts are praising the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers for the bold approach they have taken on the company's Saturn project, one that could mean a dramatic break with methods that have dominated American industry for three-quarters of a century. But some caution that worker participation in the decision-making process, a cornerstone of the contract to produce the small fuel-efficient car, is exceedingly difficult to achieve and that management, not the union or the workers, will retain ultimate authority. ''It's a fundamental change of approach,'' said David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan. ''This is where the future lies in terms of American industry being able to meet foreign competition,'' said Jerome M. Rosow, president of Work in America, Inc. a research organization in Scarsdale, N.Y. Leaders of both the company and the union stress their commitment to the innovations in the agreement, which approved by the union leadership last week. This week G.M. said the Saturn plant, which is to cost some $3.5 billion, would be constructed at Spring Hill, Tenn. The front-wheel-drive vehicle is to be marketed by 1990.
8/1/1985	G.M., and Its Union, Are Driven	In accepting a contract last week for workers at General Motors's new Saturn plant in Tennessee, the United Automobile Workers joined G.M. in one of the biggest gambles either will ever take. G.M. is betting $5 billion that it can make a small car, the Saturn, that can compete successfully against Japanese cars in the American market. The U.A.W. is betting 20 percent of its members' wages on a productivity challenge and on the conviction that employees should have a share in running their shops. The nation has an interest in seeing this gamble succeed. The stakes are greater than just one plant, even one employing 6,000.
7/31/1985	Union Pacific Deal	Union Pacific Systems said the Southern Pacific Transportation Company had agreed to perform switching service for Union Pacific rail traffic to the Fremont, Calif., plant jointly operated by the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation. The agreement ends a yearlong dispute over how the railroads would serve the plant since only Southern Pacific has direct access.
7/30/1985	Detroit Area to Get Some Saturn Jobs	The headquarters and engineering operations of the Saturn Corporation will be located in the Detroit suburbs, although the Saturn manufacturing plant will be built, as expected, in Spring Hill, Tenn., the General Motors Corporation said today. G.M. made the official announcement on the locations today, although Tennessee officials had announced last week that their state had won the bidding war for the Saturn plant.
7/28/1985	G.M. PACT SEEKS HIGH DEGREE OF COOPERATION	The agreement between the United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation for the manufacture of the company's new Saturn car calls for a level of cooperation between management and labor that has few precedents in American heavy industry. The agreement will cover an estimated 6,000 workers when the Saturn facility goes into operation toward the end of the decade. The Saturn project has been described by union and company officials as an effort to overcome cost and quality advantages Japanese companies enjoy in the production of small cars. It will use up-to-date technology, but both company and union officials said its most important innovation was in the relationship between workers and managers.
7/27/1985	AMID EXCITEMENT, SMALL TOWN HOPES G.M. WILL BE GOOD NEIGHBOR	Already this is not quite the little farming town it was even a month ago. At the Red Raider Market on Main Street today, Raymond Boatright was manning the cash register as an ABC News camera crew descended on Alderman Freeman Cowherd, the owner of the store. ''They're going Hollywood for us, all of Spring Hill,'' the part-time clerk said.
7/27/1985	INNOVATIVE PACT WINS APPROVAL OF AUTO UNION	Leaders of the United Automobile Workers today approved an innovative labor agreement to cover workers at a factory that the General Motors Corporation plans to build for its new Saturn model, a factory that Tennessee's Senators said would be built in their state. Approval of the contract had been delayed for several weeks by disputes over job security and some technical issues. Spokesmen for General Motors had said they would not announce the location of the $5 billion Saturn project, which will employ 6,000 U.A.W. members, until the approval came. In Washington, Senators Albert Gore Jr. and Jim Sasser, both Democrats, said there was no doubt that the factory site would be near Spring Hill, Tenn., about 30 miles from Nashville. ''This is a day of joy and celebration for Tennessee,'' Senator Gore said. ''We won.''
7/26/1985	G.M. Is Said to Pick Plant Site	The General Motors Corporation has selected Spring Hill, Tenn., as the site for its Saturn project, which is to employ 6,000 people, according to published reports. The Detroit Free Press reported in Friday's issue that General Motors planned to announce the selection in the next several days.
7/26/1985	U.A.W. APPROVAL SEEN ON SATURN PACT	The governing board of the United Automobile Workers union is expected to approve a labor agreement Friday that would give a major boost to the General Motors Corporation's Saturn project. The 25-member International Executive Board is scheduled to meet in Chicago to review the proposed pact. The board rejected some aspects of a preliminary draft earlier this month, but union sources said the objections had been satisfied.
7/24/1985	G.M. PROFIT DECLINED IN 2D QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation reported today that its net income in the second quarter fell 27.9 percent from a year earlier, when earnings were inflated by a tax credit. Without that, the profit drop would have been only 2 percent. Analysts nevertheless termed the latest results disappointing. They said General Motors had been hurt by heavy modernization expenses and a declining market share, caused partly by shortages of some cars.
7/23/1985	An Industrial Breakthrough	In this period of open war on unions by much of American management, the battered labor movement is getting succor from a surprising source - the biggest of big business. After four years of wage concessions, lost strikes and employer-inspired drives to decertify unions, labor leaders are exultant over the conclusion of contracts providing significant gains in union and job security at General Electric and the new California joint venture established by General Motors and Toyota. By the high-flying standards of the 1960's and 1970's, when major unions became accustomed to grabbing with both hands, the wage increases in both are modest. But the squeeze put on unions by the flight of manufacturing jobs overseas, automation, deregulation and the aggressiveness of hostile elements in industry has made survival the name of the game for them. The distinctive aspect of the agreements at G.E. and at G.M.-Toyota's New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. lies in the degree to which security provisions reflect a calculated decision by three giant multinational corporations to recognize that unions are here to stay.
7/17/1985	G.M. to Lift Prices On Compact Line	The General Motors Corporation today announced price increases that it said totaled 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent on a line of 1986 model cars. The action could signal G.M.'s pricing strategy for the 1986 models, one that has traditionally set a pattern for the rest of the industry. The increases, on the sporty compact models known internally as the N-bodies and sold as the Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Calais and Buick Somerset, are substantially above G.M.'s price moves of recent model years. It raised the price of 1985 models 2.3 percent and the 1984's by 2 percent over the previous years.
7/10/1985	UNION PROPOSING INNOVATIVE PLAN FOR WORKERS AT A NEW AUTO PLANT	Production workers at the proposed General Motors plant for the small Saturn car would be paid salaries rather than hourly wages, share perquisites with management and participate in decision-making under a proposal of the United Automobile Workers, made public today. David Mitchell, a spokesman for the union, characterized a memorandum outlining a proposed agreement between the Saturn Corporation and the auto workers as a ''working document'' and said it did not represent a tentative agreement with the General Motors subsidiary. He said it had been reviewed but not approved, by the union's 25-member International Executive Board.
7/9/1985	G.M. to Upgrade Assembly Plants	The General Motors Corporation said that it would spend $600 million on modernizing its assembly plants in Linden, N.J., and Wilmington, Del.
7/7/1985	FOUR THAT MOVED INTO MARKET	The record spate of bond issuers this spring included a braod cross-section of American industry. Just as varied were the reasons why these companies' treaurers turned to the fixed-rate market. Following are some examples. EASTMAN KODAK When it issued fixed-rate, 30-year bonds in late March, the Eastman Kodak Company gambled that interest rates would not decline sharply over the long haul. It was a bet that relatively few companies made in recent years. And it was even more exceptional because the giant photo-equipment and supply company had never issued conventional fixed-rate bonds in American capital markets, only in Europe. The 105-year-old company was such a stranger to the bond market because its cash flow had always been large enough to finance capital expenditures, said Donald Snyder, Kodak's treasurer.
7/4/1985	LATE-JUNE CAR SALES FELL 11.8%	Sales of new American-made automobiles, hindered by increased shipments from Japan, fell 11.8 percent in the last 10 days of June, the manufacturers reported today. For the full month, sales of domestically produced cars slipped 3.2 percent, on a daily selling rate basis. Imports jumped 17.5 percent in June, increasing their share of the domestic market to 27.1 percent, from 25 percent in May. ''These figures were not really a surprise,'' said Wendy Beale of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''We had been expecting a slowdown in the domestic sales rates, after the first quarter, because of the increase in imports.''
7/3/1985	G.M. to Modernize Ohio Metal Plant	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would spend up to $600 million to modernize its metal fabrication plant near Mansfield, Ohio. The project is part of G.M.'s continuing product development and investment program, which will total more than $9 billion this year.
7/1/1985	'JAPANESE' NOVA'S SALES ARE DELIGHTFUL TO G.M.	To Hector Lima, the only American characteristics about the new Chevrolet Nova he purchased recently were the nameplate on its grill and the fact that it was manufactured in the United States. There, he contended, its Yankee traits ended. ''It's got the feel of a Japanese car, it rides like a Japanese car and everything about it seems Japanese,'' said Mr. Lima, a 24-year-old Houston technician. ''When our friends saw it they said they liked it a lot, but that it looked just like a Toyota.'' Indeed, in marketing the Nova, the General Motors Corporation is straightforward about the part-Japanese heritage of the first fruit of its joint venture with Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation. ''We make no bones about the fact that it's a heavily Toyota-engineered product,'' said Ed Lechtzin, a G.M. spokesman. The model offers ''the best of both worlds,'' he said, repeating the advertising slogan adopted for the Nova.
6/29/1985	IN CHINA, 'CAPITALIST ROADERS' CAN NOW CRUISE IN CADILLACS	China, amid some ceremony, acquired a fleet of Cadillac limousines today. At a formal handover, Chinese officials lined up to accept the 20 dark blue limousines, described in Cadillac brochures as ''the car of the stars,'' each equipped with a built-in television set, refrigerator and bar. It was the kind of occasion that left Westerners with memories of Mao Zedong's China shaking their heads in disbelief. The ceremony was held only a short bicycle ride from the stadium where Mao's enemies were once paraded in duncecaps as ''capitalist roaders.''
6/27/1985	Pact Ratified At Fremont	The ratification of a landmark contract for members of the United Automobile Workers at the joint General Motors-Toyota auto making venture is ''icing on the cake'' for workers, according to a union official. The three-year contract, which virtually guarantees against layoffs and gives U.A.W. Local 2244 an unusual amount of access to decision-making, was ratified Tuesday by 92 percent of the 1,200 union employees at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.
6/27/1985	U.S. ALTERS MILEAGE RULES, AIDING FORD AND G.M.	The Environmental Protection Agency today announced changes in its formula for measuring automobile fuel economy, an action agency officials said appeared to bring all American automobile makers into compliance with Federal law. The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company together had faced more than $200 million in fines because in recent years the average fuel consumption of all their cars has exceeded the standards set by Federal law and administered by the Department of Transportation. They have asked that the standards be rolled back, but today's change in mileage formulas appeared to mean that they would not have to pay any fines. The E.P.A. said it had recalculated fuel economy for the cars of 25 manufacturers, retroactive to 1980, using the new formula. The agency said that as a result Ford and General Motors received enough credits toward achieving the standards to bring them into compliance with the law.
6/23/1985	AUTO THEFT ON THE RISE AT THE MALLS	SHOPPERS at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream have been plagued by a wave of car thefts. In fact, Nassau County Police Department officials say the mall area has the highest reported rate of car thefts in the county. Experts blame the problem at Green Acres on its access to major highways and its proximity to the Queens border, where the police say there are a number of ''chop shops'' that dismantle stolen cars and sell the parts. Once parts are taken off a vehicle, they are impossible to identify. In the Green Acres area the cars most commonly stolen are large General Motors vehicles and sports cars. Last year, car thefts in the area increased to 549 from 425 in 1983.
6/16/1985	INVESTING; THE 'NEW' G.M. MAY STILL BE ROADBOUND	DESPITE the hoopla and excitement generated by the General Motors Corporation's proposed acquisition of Hughes Aircraft, G.M., in the eyes of many analysts, remains an auto company. And that is precisely why they are not optimistic about the near-term prospects for the giant auto maker's stock. Auto issues will ''probably underperform the market,'' for the remainder of the year, said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst with E.F. Hutton & Company in New York. In fact, Ford and Chrysler may offer more value. G.M. is selling at about $74 a share, with a price/ earnings ratio of about 6. Ford, at $45 or so, sells at 2.9 times earnings and Chrysler, at about $36, has been trading at about 2.5 times earnings. With the acquisition of Hughes, G.M. has bought access to the world of high technology, some diversification and a small buffer in economic downturns. Investors who own G.M.'s regular stock will be getting an auto company ''with a little downside protection,'' predicted Maryann Keller, an analyst with Vilas Fischer Associates in New York.
6/15/1985	How to Spend the Hughes Billions	General Motors will pay $5 billion for Hughes Aircraft, making the seller, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, probably the world's largest private philanthropy. The institute will spend $200 million a year for medical research. Spending it well won't be easy.
6/14/1985	G.M. TO INVEST $170 MILLION IN WESTCHESTER PLANT	Executives of General Motors, ending years of uncertainty, said today that they planned to keep their automobile-assembly plant here open in return for a complex set of Federal, state and local incentives. The benefits, some announced by Governor Cuomo before cheering plant workers, will include cheap electricity, tax breaks, improved rail clearances and reduced import-duty costs. G.M. will invest $170 million in a new automobile-body paint shop. The present paint shop violates state emission standards and has been ordered closed by the end of 1987. When a vice president and group director of operations, David D. Campbell, said the new shop would be built, the workers evidently saw it as assurance that the plant would remain open, and they roared their approval.
6/14/1985	New-Car Sales Up 15.5% in Early June	Despite a lack of manufacturers' incentive programs and a gradual softening in consumer confidence, sales of new automobiles showed surprising strength in early June. Domestic car makers said sales rose 15.5 percent in the first 10 days of the month. Sales of light trucks increased sharply, by 35.2 percent, from the same time last year. There were eight selling days in the period this year and last.
6/9/1985	G.M. RETOOLS ITS OUTLOOK AND ITS ASSEMBLY LINES	A research engineer at General Motors' Technical Center once grumbled to a visitor that the specifications for the first practical industrial robot were developed there in the early 1960's, but nothing had come of it. At that time, the company was rich and complacent and not interested in something as seemingly risky as high-technology robotics. ''The attitude then was, 'We make cars, not tools,' '' he said. How much this attitude has changed was clear last week, when G.M. took a $5 billion gamble it hopes will enable it to compete with the formidable automakers of Japan. G.M. beat Ford Motor Company and the Boeing Company in a bidding contest for Hughes Aircraft Company, thus gaining access to high technology in aerodynamics, electronics and advanced materials, and an estimated $250 million a year in nonautomotive profits.
6/7/1985	Morgan Stanley Aide Active in Hughes Sale	During his nine years at Morgan Stanley & Company, Bruce D. Fiedorek, 34, a managing director in the firm's mergers and acquisitions department, has played a major role in some very big deals, including the Du Pont Company's $7.3 billion purchase of Conoco Inc. in 1981. But the $5 billion sale of the Hughes Aircraft Company to the General Motors Corporation, a transaction that was announced on Wednesday, is in a class by itself, he said. ''This is probably one of the most complex, if not the most complex, company that has ever been sold,'' Mr. Fiedorek said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''And because of the mystique of Howard Hughes and Hughes Aircraft, the intensity of interest in this has been extraordinary. Nothing compares with this deal.'' Mr. Fiedorek's part in it all began last August, when he laid the groundwork and outlined strategy for an initial presentation to the trustees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
6/6/1985	DESPITE PROBLEMS, HUGHES HAS SOLID HIGH-TECH REPUTATION	There is little argument that the General Motors Corporation will get access to some of the nation's most-advanced electronics expertise in buying the Hughes Aircraft Company. Hughes Aircraft, the nation's seventh-largest military supplier last year and biggest maker of communications satellites, has had a reputation as a leader in advanced electronics since its origins within the industrial empire of the late Howard R. Hughes nearly 40 years ago. Nevertheless, the company faltered badly in its missile production last year, and has occasionally disappointed the Pentagon with its problems in transferring its advanced designs from blueprints to efficient production programs. The Challenge to G.M. The challenge for General Motors, according to some experts, will lie in determining what parts of the company to leave untouched, what to attempt to fix, and what to exploit for its own existing businesses.
6/6/1985	G.M. TO ACQUIRE HUGHES AIRCRAFT IN $5 BILLION BID	The General Motors Corporation, in an ambitious diversification into aerospace and high technology, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Hughes Aircraft Company for more than $5 billion in cash and stock. If approved by the stockholders of both companies, the acquisition would be the biggest in history outside the oil industry. Hughes Aircraft, the nation's seventh-largest military supplier last year and the biggest maker of communications satellites, has had a reputation as a leader in advanced electronics since its origins nearly 40 years ago within the industrial empire of the late Howard R. Hughes. Diversification Effort The move is viewed as the latest in a long-term effort by Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman, to diversify into non-automotive fields and to improve G.M.'s competitive position by embracing new technology. [Page D19.] It also follows the company's $2.5 billion purchase last year of Electronic Data Systems Inc., one of the nation's leading data-processing companies and a major supplier to the military.
6/6/1985	HOW SALES HELP THE INSTITUTIONS	The sale of the Hughes Aircraft Company will enable the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to spend at least $200 million a year on medical research, more than doubling its current outlays, Dr. Donald S. Fredrickson, president of the institute, said yesterday. ''It promises to be one of the century's greatest challenges and an opportunity to influence the course of the biomedical sciences,'' he said, speaking for the nine trustees. The sale of Hughes Aircraft to the General Motors Corporation for more than $5 billion in cash and stock would make the Hughes Institute wealthier than the Ford Foundation, which currently is the nation's wealthiest private philanthropy, with $3.8 billion in assets. The sale, which came after years of pressure on the tax-exempt institute to devote more money to medical research, is to be completed by Aug. 15.
6/6/1985	'COMPLEMENTARY' TECHNOLOGY SEEN AS GOAL OF G.M. PURCHASE	The General Motors Corporation's acquisition of the Hughes Aircraft Company is being viewed by students of the auto industry as a major step in G.M.'s long-term plan to diversify into non-automotive fields and to improve its competitive position by embracing new technology. ''G.M. is redefining the concept of what its industry is,'' observed Prof. Malcolm Salter of the Harvard Business School. ''This is a form of related, complementary diversification that makes sense. Hughes brings into G.M. a storehouse of useful resources. It's not U.S. Steel buying Marathon Oil.'' Transforming G.M. The takeover will continue the transformation of G.M. from the technically sluggish, essentially one-product company it was at the beginning of the decade into one that will have about 9 percent of its income unrelated to car and truck sales.
6/6/1985	G.M. Venture in Japan	Nihon Hatsujo, a Japanese manufacturer of automobile suspension springs, said today that it had agreed to establish a joint venture with the General Motors Corporation. The joint venture would be G.M.'s first in Japan.
6/5/1985	G.M. DEAL FOR HUGHES IS REPORTED	The General Motors Corporation has bought the Hughes Aircraft Company in a secret bidding contest, insiders said last night. The exact price G.M. agreed to pay could not be determined, but other sources familiar with the deal said it involved close to $5 billion, about half in cash and the other half in securities. The only other two bidders were the Ford Motor Company and the Boeing Company, Wall Street sources said. At a $5 billion price, the deal would rival the proposed mergers of the Allied Corporation and the Signal Companies, and of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds.
5/25/1985	G.M. Plans Outlay Of Over $9 Billion	The General Motors Corporation will spend more than $9 billion on product development and new factories this year, Roger B. Smith, company chairman, told shareholders today at G.M.'s annual meeting. The total, which represents a 50 percent increase over the $6 billion G.M. spent on new plants and equipment in 1984. would be the second-highest capital spending figure in the company's 77-year history. G.M. has several new automobiles under development, including the highly publicized Saturn, and has started construction of a new truck plant near Fort Wayne, Ind. It has also announced plans for a new plant to replace an old factory in Fairfax, Kan.
5/24/1985	U.S. CAR SALES UP 18.2% IN MID-MAY	A fresh round of buying incentives lifted sales of new American-made automobiles 18.2 percent in the May 11-20 period, the manufacturers reported today. Sales of light trucks jumped 37.4 percent. The incentives - in the form of below-market-rate financing - were introduced early in the month, but began to show results in mid-May. A sales analyst for the Ford Motor Company suggested that last week's reduction in the prime interest rate, and the subsequent rally in the stock market, helped renew consumer confidence.
5/24/1985	G.M. STEEL COSTS MAY FALL 3%	The General Motors Corporation is nearing agreements with its steel suppliers that are expected to cut its steel costs by about 3 percent for the next model year, steel company officials and industry analysts said today. General Motors is the nation's largest steel consumer. Last year, it bought 6.5 million tons, nearly all from domestic suppliers. Its purchases accounted for more than 8 percent of the total United States shipments.
5/17/1985	Final Evidence Given In G.M. X-Car Case	Lawyers for the General Motors Corporation and the Government hauled their final boxes and binders of evidence into Federal District Court today and officially rested their cases in the 14-month-old trial of charges that G.M.'s 1980 X-cars have unsafe brakes. The Government asserts that 1.1 million X-cars, are designed so that their rear brakes tend to lock too quickly in stops, sometimes causing dangerous spins and swerves.
5/16/1985	Vehicles Are Recalled By Two Auto Makers	The Ford Motor Company has recalled 135,600 vehicles for repair, including 119,000 mid-size 1981 models with a potential pollution problem, the company has announced. In addition, the General Motors Corporation said it had recalled 34,000 1985 Chevrolet Cavaliers for removal of a plastic decoration under the hood that could shake loose from its mounting and fall on hot engine parts.
5/16/1985	Hughes Lead By G.M. Seen	The General Motors Corporation is considered the front-runner in the bidding to acquire the technology-rich Hughes Aircraft Company, Wall Street sources said today. Bids are expected to range between $4 billion and $6 billion.
5/15/1985	Ratings Raised On G.M. Units	The debt rating affecting $25 billion of securities of the General Motors Corporation and its General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the GMAC Overseas Acceptance Corporation subsidiaries has been raised, Moody's Investors Service announced yesterday. General Motors' senior notes, debentures and industrial revenue bonds rating was increased to Aa-1 from Aa-2.
5/13/1985	It Is Time to Take Another Look at the Fuel-Economy Law	To the Editor: ''Reject the Plea From Ford, G.M.'' by Senators Daniel J. Evans and John Heinz (Op-Ed, April 20) was disappointing in view of their well-earned reputations for fairness and objectivity. But, by suggesting the law affords vehicle manufacturers the alternative of paying civil penalties instead of complying with fuel-economy standards, they do a disservice to readers and to the cause of promoting understanding of the havoc wrought by the fuel-economy law.
5/9/1985	Technology;   Auto Castings: A New Process	THE origins of the ''lost wax'' process of casting metal are lost in antiquity. Archeological evidence suggests it was in use as early as 2000 B.C. in the Middle East and some of the finely detailed gold and copper figurines that survive from the period are prized museum pieces. A variation on this ancient theme, ''lost foam,'' is a hot topic in foundry circles these days. Major manufacturers such as the General Motors Corporation, John Deere & Company and the Ford Motor Company are applying it to produce the castings that are the basic building blocks of their cars, trucks and tractors. G.M. has said the process will be an important part of its Saturn project, which is to be a new G.M. small-car division, to cut auto manufacturing costs by using new technology.
5/7/1985	Accounts	* The San Diego, Northeast Indiana and the Southern Cadillac Dealers' Marketing Associations to Sawdon & Bess.
5/2/1985	8.8% Financing Set For 6 G.M. Models	The General Motors Corporation today offered 8.8 percent financing for six car models, including the Buick Somerset and Oldsmobile Calais, two new models whose sales have not been as high as G.M. had hoped. The G.M. deal, in effect through May 31, will also apply to the subcompact Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird J-cars and the Cadillac Eldorado and Seville, as well as four-wheel-drive Chevrolet and GMC compact trucks.
5/1/1985	G.M. to Replace A Plant in Kansas	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would build a new automobile assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan., to produce cars for the 1988 model year. The plant will replace a 40-year-old G.M. plant nearby and will incorporate advanced technology. The new plant will employ between 3,500 and 4,000 workers, compared with 5,200 now working in the older plant. A spokesman said the reduction would be achieved through attrition over the next two years, avoiding layoffs. Construction is to be complete by 1987.
4/28/1985	INVESTING; WALL STREET STARTS SPURNING THE BIG 3	BIG THREE auto stocks are likely to sputter for the rest of 1985, according to many Wall Street analysts, who believe General Motors, Ford and Chrysler will lag behind the stock market over the coming year. Their reasoning: These issues have already enjoyed most of their climb for this economic cycle. And large institutional investors apparently agree - they have been dumping the auto issues throughout 1985, according to a Salomon Brothers Inc. study of the flow of institutional funds. ''We don't think these stocks can outperform the market,'' said Harvey E. Heinbach, vice president and auto analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
4/27/1985	JAPAN ALLOTMENTS SET ON CARS FOR U.S.	Japan's Government told the nation's major auto makers today how many cars each may export to the United States under the new quotas announced last month. The new limits, not yet officially published, generally reward the Japanese affiliates of American auto companies at the expense of the largest Japanese auto makers, auto industry officials said. The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation will be able to more than double the number of cars they import from their Japanese affiliates. These affiliates are Isuzu Motors Ltd. and the Suzuki Motor Company, which are G.M.'s, and the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, which is Chrysler's. Isuzu and Suzuki also sell cars in the United States under their own names. The Ford Motor Company does not currently import from its Japanese affiliate, the Mazda Motor Corporation, which also sells cars under its own name. G.M. and Chrysler had both asked for large increases in the cars they import and market under their names.
4/26/1985	No Retreat on Fuel Economy	To the Editor: I am writing to express staunch opposition to the petition filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on March 1 (docket No. PRM: FE002-A) by General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Automobile Importers of America to roll back corporate average fuel economy standards from 27.5 miles a gallon to 26 miles a gallon for model year 1986 and subsequent years. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 mandated a 27.5 miles-a-gallon fuel-economy average for automobile manufacturers in the United States by 1985, and with the sole exception of the Chrysler Corporation, this legislative goal will not be met.
4/24/1985	G. M. PROFIT FALLS 33.6% IN QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation today reported first-quarter earnings of $1.07 billion, or $3.26 a share, down 33.6 percent from a record income last year of $1.61 billion, or $5.11 a share. Auto industry analysts said that slowing car sales, spending on new product programs and other costs associated with the company's reorganization were responsible for the decline. Harvey E. Heinbach, who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., said: ''I think there are two different problems here. First, the company is losing market share by not doing the volume of business they should be doing.''
4/21/1985	THE CREATIVE MIND;THE INNOVATOR	I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND crazy to you,'' apologizes Roger B.  Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation. ''But do you know what really impresses me? I saw a robot pick up an egg !'' He is, arguably, the most powerful industrialist on the face of the earth: chief executive of the world's largest automobile company, master of an empire that spans 39 countries, employs over 750,000 people, sells $84 billion worth of products a year. But as he sits in shirt sleeves in the seat of power - his corner, walnut-panelled office on the 14th floor of the General Motors Building in Detroit - 59-year-old Roger Smith talks of robots with the wide-eyed wonder of a farm boy telling the tale of his first visit to the fair. ''You show me a robot that can pick up an egg and I'll show you . . . well, it's fabulous! Picking up an egg! You know, most robots go squish '' - Smith snaps his hand shut and goes squish - ''like that. That's what most robots do. They clamp on to pick something and they, they got it.'' Smith clamps on to the imaginary egg, and all that's missing is the sight of the yolk dribbling down his left sleeve. ''But you show me a robot that can literally pick up an egg . . . that's tremendous!''
4/20/1985	REJECT THE PLEA FROM FORD, G. M.	After posting record profits last year, two of the three big auto makers - Ford and General Motors - are asking help from the deficit-ridden Government. The Government should reject the plea, which would set a bad precedent, deprive Federal coffers of millions of dollars and reward companies that drag their feet, giving them unfair competitive advantage. Specifically, the auto makers are asking the Government to ease its fuel-efficiency standard for automobiles. They say that gasoline prices are coming down and that consumers want bigger, less-efficient cars. What they do not tell you is that easing the standard could save them approximately $500 million in fines for not reaching the required fuel-efficiency level. And that in turn is revenue that could be used by the Government to fund important social programs.
4/17/1985	CORRECTION	A chart in Business Day on Saturday with an article about bonuses given top executives by the Detroit auto makers misstated part of the income of F. James McDonald, president of the General Motors Corporation. He received a bonus of $810,000, half in cash and half in stock, and did not exercise any stock options.
4/17/1985	Analysts Favor G.M.'s Class E	FOR months now, Thursday, April 18, has been heralded as decision day for original holders of the class E common stock issued last October by the General Motors Corporation in its $2.5 billion acquisition of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation. The accepted word on Wall Street was that, if the stock were sold before April 18, shareholders would give up a lucrative plum, namely the right to retain a contingent promissory note entitling them to receive an effective high interest rate for a number of years. This note is not transferable. But as it turns out, G.M. sources explained late yesterday, the actual decision day was last Friday. That is because shares sold last Friday do not settle until Friday, April 19 - the first time that G.M. itself sees that the shares have changed hands.
4/13/1985	BIG BONUSES AT THE BIG 3 AGAIN	Top executives of the Big Three auto makers have collected big bonuses again this year for a 1984 in which the companies reported record earnings totaling almost $10 billion. The total pay levels for 1984 were larger than those for 1983, which had brought the auto industry a barrage of criticism from Washington, labor circles and the general public as well. Once again, Roger B. Smith, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, was paid the most in salary and various bonuses, a combination that brought him $2,342,000 for 1984. In 1983, he received $1,491,000. The 1984 increase mostly reflected a deferred bonus plan that averaged $250,000 a year for 1982 through 1984 but was paid this year.
4/13/1985	TRUST SUIT DROPPED BY CHRYSLER	The Chrysler Corporation announced today that it had dropped an antitrust suit seeking to stop the joint production of Chevrolet Nova cars in California by the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan. Richard Goodyear, vice president and chief lawyer for Chrysler, said he could not comment on the reasons for the out-of-court settlement because its contents were sealed by the United States District Court in Washington, where the suit was filed in January 1984. Chrysler's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, had denounced the G.M.-Toyota accord as an illegal linkup of industrial giants that could severely damage competition in the industry.
4/11/1985	G. M. to Close Major Foundry PONTIAC, Mich., April 10	The General Motors Corporation, citing excess capacity, said that it would shut its engine-block foundry in Pontiac, the second closing of a major G.M. foundry. Production will be cut in the summer of 1986 and will end the next year, affecting about 1,800 blue-collar and 200 management workers.
4/10/1985	G. M. Agrees to Recall 121,000 X- and A-Cars	The General Motors Corporation has agreed to recall up to 121,000 1984 X-cars and A-cars whose engines may leak gasoline and catch fire, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today. But the Center for Auto Safety, an independent watchdog group, said that General Motors and the safety agency were ''negligent'' because their investigation and reporting of the safety defect was tardy. A General Motors spokesman, R. T. Kingman, said the cars to be recalled have 2.5 liter, four-cylinder, fuel-injected engines.
4/5/1985	No Headline	''We are in a global industry now,'' declared Roger B. Smith, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation. ''All the companies in the automobile industry must consider how best to rationalize their facilities and production.'' Mr. Smith's comments came at the formal dedication today of one of the industry's most prominent such attempts, G.M's joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two companies are making Chevrolets in a former G.M. plant using Toyota's production system.
4/4/1985	NOW 'INTRAPRENEURSHIP' IS HOT	For years, management gurus have argued that entrepreneurship would be the panacea for the United States economy's competitive ills. Now, a theory has come onto the American business scene that, if not questioning the conventional wisdom, certainly casts it in a different light. The theory goes by varying terms: corporate entrepreneurship, corporate venturing, ''intrapreneurship.'' But they all convey the same idea - that employees can be entrepreneurs while working for large companies.
4/4/1985	LATE MARCH CAR SALES ROSE 6.9%	Sales of new domestically made cars rose moderately throughout March, gaining 6.9 percent in the last 10 days of the month from the 1984 period, the major manufacturers said today. ''This was pretty much in line with what we're looking for,'' said Jean- Claude Gruet, a securities analyst who covers the auto industry for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''The 10 days came in a little lower than the numbers we've seen in the last 8 to 10 weeks, but it is still in the expected range.'' In the period, which had 9 selling days this year and 10 last year, the companies sold a total of 301,496 cars, or 33,500 a day. For all of March, sales rose 5.6 percent, to 768,927 units, bringing the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate to 8.4 million.
4/1/1985	U. A. W. ACCORD IS REACHED ON CANADIAN INDEPENDENCE	An agreement has been reached allowing the Canadian division of the United Automobile Workers to leave the union. Canadian locals of the U.A.W. will vote later this year on whether to remain in the international union or to join the Canadian labor organization being formed. Under the terms of the agreement, reached Saturday in Toronto, the new Canadian union would receive $23.7 million from the Detroit-based union, which includes a $21 million strike fund, a $2.31 million general fund, buildings, mortgages and other Canadian union assets.
3/24/1985	47,000 Corvettes Recalled	The General Motors Corporation has day recalled 47,000 of its 1984 Chevrolet Corvette sports cars for repair of the cruise control systems, which it said could cause ''unexpected engine acceleration.'' Some customers in colder climates had complained that their cruise controls were acting up and a check showed that a part in the solenoid, an electrical coil, could corrode, Ed Lechtzin, a spokesman for General Motors, said Thursday. Dealers will replace the part and relocate it under the hood so it is not as exposed to the elements, Mr. Lechtzin said.
3/22/1985	Saturn Bidders Swamp G.M. DETROIT, March 21 (AP) -	The General Motors Corporation said today that it might miss the tentative May 1 deadline for choosing a site for its Saturn auto factory because of a flood of applications.
3/14/1985	Car Sales Rose by 3.3% In Early March Period	Sales of new American-made automobiles increased 3.3 percent in the March 1-10 period from last year, the manufacturers reported today. Several of the auto makers offered financial incentives to customers during the period. The six companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen and American Honda - sold a total of 193,896 new cars in the period, which had eight selling days this year and nine in 1984. The industrywide daily selling rate of 24,237 units was the highest for the early March period since 1981, when the companies were offering cash rebates to buyers.
3/13/1985	Iacocca Cites Chrysler Plan	The Chrysler Corporation's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, is predicting that the No. 3 auto maker will beat the General Motors Corporation with a high- technology small car. At a private dinner here on Monday night, he said, according to several people who attended but did not wish to be identified, that Chrysler's ''Liberty'' project was far enough along for him to boast about taking on G.M., which is more than four times the size of Chrysler. Mr. Iacocca did not say whether Chrysler would build the new car with a partner, such as its Japanese affiliate, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation.
3/8/1985	290,000 Cadillacs Recalled Because of Pollution Problem	The General Motors Corporation will recall 290,000 Cadillacs to fix potentially defective pollution control equipment, the third recall by the company in five months for the same problem, the Environmental Protection Agency says.
3/7/1985	CORRECTION	A front-page article last Saturday about President Reagan's decision against asking Japan for further export quotas on automobiles misstated the combined 1984 earnings of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. They were $9.8 billion.
3/5/1985	STATE TO OFFER G.M. 2 SITES FOR A NEW AUTO FACTORY	The Cuomo administration will offer two sites - one in western New York and one in the Hudson Valley - to General Motors for its new $1.5 billion Saturn car plant. Next Tuesday, joining a procession of more than a dozen other governors, Mr. Cuomo plans to travel to Warren, Mich., to try to persuade General Motors that New York State is where the Saturn auto factory should be. ''Our approach will be to sell General Motors first and foremost on coming to New York State, and there are a thousand reasons for them to do that,'' said Stephen J. Morello, the deputy director of economic development. ''We'll emphasize everything from the business climate, including our tax structure and pending income-tax reductions, to the quality of life, and we will focus on two particular sites.''
3/1/1985	G.M.-China Licensing Pact DETROIT, Feb. 28 (AP) -	The General Motors Corporation announced that it would license a Chinese company to build a line of transmissions for heavy machinery. The 10-year agreement, between G.M.'s Detroit Diesel Allison division and Qijian Gear Works in Sichuan Province, is its first with China, G.M. said.
2/26/1985	G.M. Unit's Stock Posts Decline	The class E common stock of General Motors' Electronic Data Systems subsidiary dropped $3.75 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $67.75.
2/18/1985	G.M. GETTING ROSES AND PROPOSALS FROM SUITORS FOR SATURN CAR PLANT	Some states have sent governors, and some towns have sent roses. They are all pursuing what many economic development officials consider the catch of the 1980's: General Motors' $5 billion factory to build the future Saturn car model and the 6,000 to 15,000 jobs it will create. Braving the snow and ice here, more than a dozen governors have been ushered into a small, sparsely furnished conference room in the suburb of Warren, Mich. There, they have delivered sales pitches for their states and answered questions from officials who are deciding where to manufacture the company's answer to the imported models that dominate the small- car market. Governor Kean of New Jersey had his turn on Friday, and the manufacturer has appointments with at least five more governors, including Governor Cuomo.
2/14/1985	Auto Sales Up 2.3% in Early February	Despite extremely cold weather over much of the nation, new-car sales for the six major domestic producers increased 2.3 percent in the first 10 days of February compared with the corresponding period in 1984, the companies reported today. The increase is on the basis of average daily sales, with eight selling days in this year's period and nine last year. The companies sold 165,221 new cars in the Feb. 1-10 period, or 20,653 a day. That compares with 181,694, or 20,188 daily, last year.
2/11/1985	DETROIT WOOS YOUNGER CAR BUYERS	She is about 34 years old and single, most likely a college graduate, and she earns between $30,000 and $35,000 a year. This is the customer who is the primary target of the General Motors Corporation's Chevrolet division as it prepares to bring the Nova, the product of its joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation, to market this summer. Research shows that 57 percent of all auto buyers are female.
2/10/1985	Seat-Belt Offer	In a safety program stressing that ''seat belts are life belts,'' General Motors began to give free life-insurance policies last April with all its new cars and light trucks. If anyone was fatally injured while buckled in a seat belt in the vehicles, G.M. said, it would pay $10,000 to the victim's estate.
2/6/1985	JAN. 21-31 CAR SALES OFF 4.1%	Sales of new American-made automobiles slipped 4.1 percent on a daily rate basis in late January from an extremely strong period last year, the six major auto makers reported today. The daily selling rate for the Jan. 21-31 period was 26,850, compared with 28,002 in 1984. For all of January, sales were up 3.5 percent. The daily sales rate of 24,155 was the best for the month since 1979. The rate in January 1984 was 23,337. In all, 628,037 cars were sold, compared with 583,429 in January 1984.
2/5/1985	NEW HEAD FOR SATURN UNIT	William E. Hoglund, a financial executive who has demonstrated a flair for automobile marketing, today was chosen president of the General Motors Corporation's Saturn subsidiary. He succeeds Joseph J. Sanchez, who died of a heart attack Jan. 6, after just a few weeks in thA post as chief 'xecutive of G.M.'s newest operating unit. Mr. Sanchez was 54 years old. Mr. Hoglund's new ob represents at least a nominal demotion, since he will have to give up his title of group executive. He will remain a vice president of 'he corporation, however, reporting to Lloyd Ruess, the head of G.M.'s Chevrolet, Pontiac, G.M. of Canada Froup.
2/5/1985	G.M. NET OFF 32.4% IN 4TH QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation reported today that it earned $877 million, or $2.71 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1984. The results were in line with analysts' expectations although they said a lower-than-anticipated tax rate gave the final period an artificial increase. The fourth quarter earnings were 32.4 percent below the $1.297 billion, or $4.11 a share, earned in the fourth quarter of 1983, with the decline attributed to union work stoppages and production delays related to quality problems. Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, noted that G.M. paid $45 million in taxes during the 1984 period, compared with $1.015 billion in the 1983 quarter.
2/5/1985	Norwest in Talks to Sell Mortgage Unit to G.M.	The Norwest Corporation said yesterday that it was holding ''preliminary discussions'' to sell its troubled mortgage-banking subsidiary to the General Motors Corporation. A sale would rid Norwest, a major bank holding company, of a subsidiary that has hurt its profitability. It would also move the auto giant into another sector of financial services.
1/30/1985	TOYOTA CALLS TUNE IN ITS G.M. VENTURE	Japanese auto manufacturers help insure that the interior of a car is installed properly by taking off the doors, so they will not be in the way, and then putting them back on farther down the assembly line. American auto executives have resisted the technique, saying it is too hard to get the doors to fit right the second time. But there is no argument about doors here, at the former General Motors Corporation assembly plant now operated by New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a 50-50 joint venture of G.M. and the Toyota Motor Corporation. On the Chevrolet Nova, the product of the new venture, the doors come off and go back on.
1/29/1985	CORRECTION	Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday of Joseph J. Sanchez, a General Motors executive, gave the date of his death incorrectly. It was Saturday.
1/28/1985	JOSEPH J. SANCHEZ OF G.M. DIES AT 54	Joseph J. Sanchez, a General Motors executive who was chosen three weeks ago to head the company's new Saturn Corporation, died Sunday at the Edward W. Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich., of complications following a heart attack. He was 54 years old and lived in East Lansing. Mr. Sanchez, who was considered one of the most talented and personable executives to rise through the ranks of the world's largest automobile manufacturer, was hospitalized Tuesday after he suffered a heart attack. The hospital said he went into cardiac arrest on Friday.
1/27/1985	JOSEPH SANCHEZ, G.M. OFFICIAL PICKED TO HEAD NEW DIVISION	Joseph J. Sanchez, a General Motors executive who was chosen three weeks ago to head the company's new Saturn Corporation, died today at the Edward W. Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich., of complications following a heart attack. He was 54 years old and lived in East Lansing. Mr. Sanchez, who was considered one of the most talented and personable executives to rise through the ranks of the world's largest automobile manufacturer, had been hospitalized Tuesday after he suffered a heart attack. The hospital said he went into cardiac arrest on Friday.
1/25/1985	G.M. Recalls 225,000 Cars	The General Motors Corporation is recalling about 225,000 1981 and 1982 cars to fix potentially defective pollution control equipment, the Environmental Protection Agency said today. The vehicles, equipped with 4.1-liter V-6 engines, include the 1982 Buick Regal and Regal Estate Wagon; the Pontiac Bonneville, Bonneville Wagon and Grand Prix and the 1981 and 1982 Cadillac DeVille, Fleetwood Brougham, Eldorado and Seville; Buick Electra, LeSabre and Riviera; and the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight and Toronado.
1/24/1985	Market Place;   Positive Tilt On G.M. Stock	WHEN the blue chips finally came to life on Monday in a surging stock market, a frequent comment on Wall Street was that ''the generals have started to catch up with the rest of the army of smaller issues.'' One general clearly on the move this week is the General Motors Corporation, whose shares sold yesterday at their loftiest price since 1973. On the New York Stock Exchange, G.M. rose 1 3/8, to 84 1/4. The stock of the automotive giant finished last Friday at 80 1/4. Its record price, incidentally, stands at 113 3/4 in 1965.
1/24/1985	JAN. 11-20 CAR SALES ROSE 4.1%	New-car sales by the nation's six major manufacturers rose 4.1 percent in the Jan. 11-20 selling period, the companies reported today. The average daily rate of sales was the highest for the period since 1973. The companies sold 168,668 new automobiles, or 21,084 a day, up from 182,273, or 20,253 a day, last year. There were with eight selling days in the period this year and nine last year. In the 1973 period, there were 23,390 cars sold a day.
1/24/1985	G.M. Aide Hospitalized	Joseph Sanchez, the new president of the General Motors Corporation's Saturn car project, suffered a heart attack and has been admitted to a hospital intensive care unit, G.M. said today. Mr. Sanchez, 54 years old, had been head of G.M.'s Oldsmobile division until his appointment to the Saturn post two weeks ago. Saturn is G.M.'s high-technology, car-of-the-future project.
1/16/1985	Early-January Auto Sales Rose 12%	Opening the new year with higher-than-expected sales, American auto makers reported today that new-car sales in the Jan. 1-10 period rose 12 percent, on a daily selling rate basis. The annual selling rate, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, was 8.9 million units, up from a rate of 8 million in the last 10 days of December and from a strong 8.2 million in the period a year ago. The daily selling rate for the early- January period of 23,859 was the highest since 1966, when the domestic companies sold cars at a daily rate of 28,922. Industry analysts had expected sales to be flat or down slightly from last year's robust level. Some cautioned that the better-than-expected sales were the result of slow sales in December because of cold weather and the holidays.
1/15/1985	New Cadillac Is Allante	The General Motors Corporation announced today that its 1987 luxury two-seat convertible from Cadillac would be named the Allante. The car will be assembled in Detroit, using bodies designed and manufactured in Turin, Italy, by the Pininfarina.
1/14/1985	G.M.'S INNOVATIONS AT SATURN	In a kiss-and- tell book about life in the executive suite at the General Motors Corporation, John DeLorean complained about the burden that paperwork imposed on top G.M. managers when he was a vice president there. Before an executive went to a meeting, he was expected to read the advance text of every presentation to be given, Mr. DeLorean recalled. ''There were literally 600 to 700 pages a day to be read and processed,'' he marvelled in the book, ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors,'' published some years ago. Last week, General Motors formed a new company to make the Saturn, its first new brand-name since World War I, and one of the ideas is to make cars without that blizzard of paper. ''They're going to have their own business systems,'' said Roger B. Smith, General Motors' chairman, and the enthusiastic patron of the new subsidiary. ''We want the minimum amount of paperwork. We've given them an 8 1/2-by-11 sheet of paper and told them to get everything they can on that, and throw the rest away.''
1/9/1985	G.M. CUTS ESTIMATE ON PROFIT SHARING	Production workers at the General Motors Corporation, who were told in contract negotiations last summer that they could expect to receive about $1,000 in profit sharing for 1984, will get only about half that amount, company officials said today. The profit-sharing provision was a key part of the contract negotiated last fall by the United Automobile Workers. Workers accepted pay increases of less than 3 percent a year in return for increased job security and the additional income from a share of General Motors' profits.
1/9/1985	G.M. STARTS SATURN CAR SUBSIDIARY	The General Motors Corporation, continuing the sweeping reorganization that began early last year, said today that it was establishing a subsidiary corporation to sell a new line of advanced-technology subcompacts under the Saturn name. It is the first time in 67 years that G.M. has established a new brand name and the first time it has tried to use a subsidiary, rather than a division, to make cars. G.M. said it would commit $5 billion to the new unit, to be called the Saturn Corporation, with an initial capitalization of $150 million. Separate Labor Contract The subsidiary will have its own labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union and its own network of dealers, G.M. said. The development of a separate corporaton, which was unexpected within the industry, is an outgrowth of Project Saturn, G.M.'s research effort to use advanced manufacturing technology and revised labor relations to produce small cars that are equal in cost and quality to those made in Japan.
1/5/1985	THE AUTO INDUSTRY'S BIG YEAR	American consumers bought a total of 14.1 million cars and light trucks in 1984, giving the automobile industry its best sales year since 1979. Although total sales fell below the peaks set in the mid-1970's, the robust year should produce record- setting profits for the Big Three auto makers, which are expected to report combined earnings of about $10 billion. That sum would easily surpass the previous record of $6.15 billion set last year and is well above the $4.5 billion earned in 1978, when total car and truck sales reached 15 million. Even allowing for inflation, $10 billion in profits for last year would be appreciably lusher than the 1978 earnings.
1/4/1985	Dec. 11-20 Auto Sales Fell 3% Shortage of Inventory Seen	Sales of new cars by the nation's six major auto manufacturers fell a slight 3 percent in the Dec. 11-20 period, the companies reported today. Industry analysts noted that while sales were down slightly, the comparable 1983 period was exceptionally strong and that some car lines were in short supply this year. ''Sales were not so much a reflection of demand, but an inventory-induced aberration,'' said Ted Sullivan, an economist with Data Resources Inc. The companies reported a daily sales rate of 21,801 in the mid-December period, down from the 22,469 daily rate in the comparable 1983 period. There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight last year.
1/4/1985	Ford Won't	- The Ford Motor Company said that it would not raise its car prices in response to the latest price increase by the industry leader, the General Motors Corporation. A statement issued by Philip Benton, Ford's vice president for North American operations,
12/14/1984	Dec. 1-10 Car Sales Rebound by 19.9%	Sales of new cars bounced back in the first 10 days of December with the nation's six major manufacturers today reporting sales of 184,470 units, up 19.9 percent from the period last year, on a daily rate basis. The annual selling rate for cars, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, rose to 9 million units, from an unusually low 6.4 million rate at the end of November. Automotive analysts, who often caution that one 10-day sales report does not indicate a trend, said the 30-day running average of about 7.8 million units was back to more normal levels. ''The erratic sales pattern of the past 40 days will have to show some stability for the next 20 days before anyone can really say where the market is going,'' said L.R. Windecker, an analyst for the Ford Motor Company. ''But the trend of the past 30 days is better than we saw through September and October.''
12/13/1984	Colombia Unit Of G.M. Ailing BOGOTA, Colombia, Dec. 12	The General Motors Corporation said today that its Colombian subsidiary lost $29.4 million in 1984 and by early 1985 will be close to bankruptcy. David Herman, president of the subsidiary, Colmotores Fabrica Colombiana de Automotores S.A., said G.M. wants the Government to allow price increases so it can stop operating at a loss.
12/9/1984	THE NATION ; G.M. Faces FactsOn Diesel Cars	In the 1970's, when the price of gasoline began soaring, many analysts thought diesel-powered cars were certain to capture a sizable portion of the American market. Last week, after years of poor sales and widespread complaints about performance, General Motors said that after the current model year it would offer the diesel option on just one of its many car lines.
12/6/1984	Read It and Weep	Ralph Nader yesterday issued 5,000 copies of ''The General Motors Lemon Grover,'' which he described as a compilation, to be published annually, of letters from disgruntled owners of cars made by the General Motors Corporation. ''This lets consumers speak for themselves,'' Mr. Nader said, adding that it was an attempt to counter some G.M. commercials in which car owners wax enthusiastic over the company's products. The 40-page paper sells for $1. Mr. Nader said a free copy would be sent to Roger B. Smith, chairman of G.M.
12/5/1984	NOV. 21-30 CAR SALES OFF 14.2%	New-car sales by the nation's major auto makers fell 14.2 percent in the last 10 days of November, surprising industry executives and analysts who were expecting the trend to continue upward from mid-November. Sales have been restrained recently by inventory shortages created by strikes at the General Motors Corporation and by a shortage of parts. Throughout November the companies produced cars at record levels and sales surged in the middle of the month, slightly above projections. But the companies reported today that, in the selling period that ended Nov. 30, deliveries totaled 186,721, down from 217,540 last year. That brought the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate to 6.4 million, down from 7.9 million for mid-November and 7.3 million for the end-of-November period in 1983.
12/5/1984	Norfolk Southern	The Norfolk Southern Corporation said it would buy 100 high-efficiency locomotives next year for $129 million. Norfolk Southern said it would purchase 50 locomotives from the General Electric Company and 50 from the General Motors Corporation's Electro-Motive division for its operating subsidiaries, the Norfolk & Western Railway and the Southern Railway.
12/5/1984	G.M. DROPS MOST OF ITS DIESEL CARS	The diesel- powered passenger car, which not all that long ago seemed on its way to capturing a big chunk of the American car market, now seems headed toward a dead end. The General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest auto maker, said today that it would quit offering the diesel option on all but one of its car lines after the current model year. It now offers diesels in various model lines of all five of its car divisions, from Chevrolet through Cadillac. General Motors said that the decision to drop diesels, which were once regarded as an important means of improving fuel economy, was a response to deeply depressed sales and more stringent emissions standards that are to go into effect next year.
12/3/1984	EXECUTIVES SPLIT ON TAX PLAN	Although the profound changes in tax policy proposed by the Treasury last week would eliminate major breaks for business, no single wave of opposition has yet to emerge from the corporate world. In fact, some corporations, at least in public, are putting in a good word for the principle of tax simplification and a more equitable system even as they complain about provisions that would hurt their industry. Not all industries would suffer equally under the changes. Basic industries might find capital formation more difficult, business people say, but service industries might benefit. Specifically, the Treasury's proposal would eliminate the investment tax credit, curb accelerated depreciation schedules and end much of the preferential treatment of capital gains. Some executives see these and other provisions as disruptive to the economy. But the plan would also lower the basic corporate tax rate to 33 percent, from 46 percent, a change that elicited some support.
11/28/1984	NOV. 11-20 AUTO SALES IMPROVED SHARP 28.8%	Automobile sales improved sharply in the Nov. 11- 20 period, the manufacturers reported here today. Sales by the six major companies jumped 28.8 percent in mid- November from the period last year. Industry analysts said the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 7.9 million was near normal, following a strike-induced slump that brought the rate down to 6.9 million early this month and the same level for all of October.
11/27/1984	TOP THREE AMERICAN AUTOMAKERS RECALL 4 MILLION VEHICLES	The nation's three largest automobile manufacturers today announced they were recalling more than four million automobiles to inspect and repair potential safety defects. The Department of Transportation announced that the General Motors Corporation had agreed to call back 3.1 million of its mid-size passenger cars from the 1978 to 1980 model years for ''inspection'' and repairs ''where needed'' of rear axles. Wear in the axle compartments had been found, in some cases, to cause separation of the axle shaft and wheel assembly from the rest of the vehicle. The callback was the largest such action of its kind since the 1973 recall of 3.7 million General Motors vehicles for correction of steering lock defects.
11/25/1984	Chevrolet's Trio Challenge Imports	GENERAL Motors has been doing some interesting things lately. First, there was the corporation's inner split into equal primacies, one for small cars - basically Chevrolet and Pontiac - and one for the traditionally bigger cars of Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac. Then there was the decision to join with Toyota in building a car in California. Next came a tiny, three-cylinder automobile, built in Japan by Suzuki but carrying the Chevy Sprint nameplate and sold only in nine Western states. And now there is a further bit of Balkanization.
11/25/1984	G.M. REJECTS A PLEA BY FEDERAL AGENCY FOR RECALL OF X-CARS	The General Motors Corporation has rejected a Government request that it recall its 1.1 million 1980 X-cars. The Government asserts that in certain circumstances power-assisted brakes on the 1980 Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix, Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile Omega do not operate unless intense foot pressure is applied. An official of the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration contended that the defect in the front-wheel-drive automobile has caused at least 106 accidents, 31 injuries and possibly one death. Brake Defects Denied Lawyers and spokesmen for General Motors have repeatedly denied that the X-car has any brake defects.
11/24/1984	FOREIGN AID BY U.S. IS TIED TO EXPORTS	In what Washington describes as an attempt to counter countries that unabashedly subsidize their exports, the United States is using funds intended for foreign aid to reduce the price of American exports. About a month ago, the United States allocated $4.2 million, which was to have helped the southern African country of Botswana buy commodities, to reduce the interest rate that Botswana will pay on a loan if it buys locomotives from the General Electric Company or the General Motors Corporation. If Botswana signs the contract for the locomotives, it will get the $4.2 million, which it can apply to the financing costs. This is the first mixed credit - so called because foreign aid is mixed into a loan - that the United States has offered, aside from an experimental program confined by legislation to Egypt.
11/23/1984	Jump Is Seen In Car Sales	Fifteen million cars and trucks will be sold in the United States next year, Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, predicts. Mr. Smith, in an interview Wednesday, said sales in this country by American and foreign companies will jump from 1984's expected level of about 14.5 million.
11/23/1984	Chevette Recall Suggested	The Federal Government said Tuesday that it had recommended the recall of 29,000 Chevrolet Chevette subcompact cars because of the potential for a rear- brake lockup.
11/16/1984	INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FLAT IN OCTOBER	Industrial production in the United States was unchanged in October, the Federal Reserve Board said today. But a number of analysts attributed the sluggishness to temporary factors and predicted modest gains in coming months. In September, according to revised figures, production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities declined a steep five-tenths of 1 percent, in the first setback since November 1982, which was the low point of the last recession. Many economists had expected the September decline to be erased by a strong gain in October.
11/15/1984	Nov. 1-10 Car Sales Fell by 4.7 Percent	Sales of new cars by the nation's six major auto manufacturers slipped 4.7 percent in the first 10 days of November, the companies reported here today. Sales by the six companies totaled 188,775 in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last, down from 198,126 in 1983. The decline was attributed to supply problems at the General Motors Corporation because of strikes against G.M. in September and October and to a shortage of parts needed for the 1985 models by G.M. supplier companies.
11/6/1984	OCT.21-31 CAR SALES INCREASED 3.3%	Sales of new American-made automobiles rose 3.3 percent in the Oct. 21-31 period from the comparable period a year before, despite strikes against the General Motors Corporation's Canadian plants that held down G.M. sales. The daily combined selling rate of 27,184 reported by the six domestic auto companies today was the highest in the late October period since 1979. Total sales for the period were 244,659, compared with 236,895 in 1983. There were nine selling days in each period.
11/2/1984	MOODY'S REVIEWS CAR MAKER RATING	Debt ratings for the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are being reviewed for possible upgrading, analysts at Moody's Investors Service announced yesterday.
11/1/1984	BOOM IN LUXURY CAR IMPORTS	For almost two decades, European car makers have nibbled away at the highly profitable American luxury car market with hardly any response from the Big Three. Stressing high performance and engineering advances, the Europeans are fielding such makes as the Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Audi, BMW and Saab to do battle with Detroit's traditional view of the luxury car: a big, lushly appointed highway cruiser with a large engine, like the Cadillac and Lincoln. In recent years, the Japanese joined the fray, exporting the Toyota Cressida and Nissan Maxima, among others. The imports are increasing their market share at a time when luxury models of all kinds, including the traditional makes, have become more popular, accounting for about 10 percent of total sales this year. Some American auto executives now concede that they were as unprepared to meet the Europeans at the top of the market as they were to take on the Japanese several years ago at the lower end. ''We didn't recognize as early as some other parts of the world that the market for luxury vehicles was changing in terms of what it wanted in addition to the traditional elements of comfort, image and prestige,'' said John O. Grettenberger, the general manager of Cadillac.
10/30/1984	G.M.-Korea Deal	The General Motors Corporation and South Korea's Daewoo group, a leading business conglomerate, said they had agreed to produce automotive parts by 1986 in a joint venture. Roger Smith, G.M.'s chairman, said total investment would come to $60 million. G.M. and Daewoo each would put in $10 million, with the remainder coming from loans, he said. G.M.'s Delco Remy division and Daewoo Precision Industries will turn out cranking motors, alternators, ignition distributors and ignition coils at the plant in Nongong, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, G.M. said.
10/30/1984	WORKERS APPROVE A CONTRACT AT GENERAL MOTORS IN CANADA	Automobile workers at the 13 Canadian plants of the General Motors Corporation ratified a new labor contract today, ending a strike that forced more than 40,000 layoffs in the United States. Meanwhile, the United Automobile Workers announced that others of its members had approved a new three- year contract with the Ford Motor Company in the United States by a vote of 33,312 to 18,386, or 64 percent to 36 percent. The contract is patterned after the General Motors pact for the United States.
10/27/1984	COURT ORDERS G.M. TO RECALL ENGINES	Vehicles violating emission control standards must be recalled even if automobile makers offer to offset the pollution by reducing emission levels in later models, a Federal appeals court ruled today. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia made the 3-to-0 ruling in a case involving a line of engines built by the General Motors Corporation. (The Associated Press reported the recall order applied to 700,000 Pontiacs built in 1979.)
10/27/1984	PROGRESS REPORTED IN AUTO TALKS TO RESOLVE G.M. STRIKE IN CANADA	Progress was reported today in negotiations between General Motors of Canada and the United Automobile Workers as the company made a new economic offer after almost a week of deadlock. The offer, described as a ''broad, all- encompassing proposal'' by the union's Canadian leader, Robert White, came as the effects of the nine-day-old walkout by 36,000 Canadian workers continued to spread in the United States. The details of the offer were not disclosed.
10/27/1984	G.M. to Rehire Laid-Off Workers	The General Motors Corporation plans to resume a second shift at its North Tarrytown plant, offering employment to the more than 1,800 people laid off two years ago, a company spokesman said today. ''We're planning to add a second shift in the spring and a shift averages about 2,000,'' the spokesman, Patricia Molloy, said.
10/25/1984	Auto Sales Fall 6.5%; G.M. Strikes Blamed	Sales of new American-made automobiles, held down by strikes at the nation's largest car maker, fell 6.5 percent in the Oct. 11-20 period, according to figures released today by the nation's six major automobile manufacturers. Selected General Motors Corporation assembly plants in the United States were shut down for six days late last month by the United Automobile Workers when negotiators failed to reach an agreement on a new labor contract. And workers in Canada walked off the job Oct. 17, when talks stalled on a new labor contract there. Many American assembly plants are dependent on components produced only in Canada, and G.M. began closing those plants late last week.
10/25/1984	G.M. STRIKE IMPASSE BROKEN, CANADIAN UNION LEADER SAYS	An impasse that stalled talks between striking United Auto Workers and the Canadian subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation was broken tonight, raising hopes of an early settlement, a union leader said. ''It's fair to describe it as a breakthrough in terms of getting the process started,'' Robert White, the union's director for Canada, a news conference. ''We have transformed the mood from pessimism to very cautious optimism,'' Mr. White said.
10/22/1984	AUTO UNION IS STRAINED BY IMPACT OF CANADIAN STRIKE	Union officials contend that the five-day-old strike by 36,000 Canadian automobile workers against the General Motors Corporation is putting a strain on relations with members of the same union in the United States who now face layoffs. More than 10,000 American members of the United Automobile Workers who recently voted to ratify a three-year contract with General Motors will be forced off the job Monday because of parts shortages caused by the shutdown in Canada, which began last Wednesday. Company officials here have said layoffs in the United States were likely to spread rapidly as nine auto assembly plants dependent on components made only in Canadian factories depleted existing stocks. Some of those forced off the job were recalled only within the last year from long layoffs caused by the auto industry's slump in the early 1980's and some had participated in the selective strikes last month that helped win the agreement with the company in the United States.
10/21/1984	UNION ACCEPTS G.M. CONTRACT	The outcome seemed iffy at times, but last week the United Auto Workers announced that its members had ratified a new contract with the General Motors Corporation. Union spokesmen said the agreement, rejected by several large locals in the early stages of the two- week voting period, had been approved by 57 percent. G.M. president Roger B. Smith and U.A.W. president Owen F. Bieber signed the contract, which covers 350,000 workers and stesses job security over wage increases, on Friday. The settlement was preceded by a strike at 17 plants that may have cost G.M. as much as $200 million. That will apparently be the pattern for Canada. At week's end, some 36,600 U.A.W. workers were on strike against General Motors of Canada. The walkout began after the union rejected a contract that Robert White, U.A.W. director for Canada, called an unacceptable ''rubber- stamp copy'' of the American pact.
10/20/1984	G.M. TO CLOSE PLANTS IN U.S. BECAUSE OF STRIKE IN CANADA	The General Motors Corporation will begin shutting down automobile assembly plants in the United States on Monday as a result of the strike at its Canadian operations, an official said today. The action will idle nearly 11,000 American workers initially, with the number likely rise next week as the closings spread. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Canadian United Automobile Workers in Toronto said bargainers for both sides did not appear to have narrowed their differences, although talks were to continue through the weekend. Top negotiators for the union and General Motors of Canada met late this morning for what Robert White, the union leader, said was ''a sharp exchange of views.'' He said there were still ''fundamental disagreements'' over what would constitute an acceptable agreement after the two-hour meeting at the main negotiating table.
10/18/1984	UNION WALKS OUT AT G.M. IN CANADA	About 36,000 workers in Ontario and Quebec struck the General Motors Corporation's Canadian operations today. An official of the United Automobile Workers in Canada, Wendy Cuthbertson, said the union formally rejected a revised company offer about 9 o'clock Tuesday night. Robert White, the head of the Canadian branch of the union, branded the second offer as a ''rubber stamp'' of one that was turned down by the union about a week and a half ago. It was the first time Canadian workers had struck G.M. since 1970, when they were off the job for 94 days.
10/17/1984	Union Rejects A G.M. Offer TORONTO, Oct. 16 (AP) -	Canadian auto workers rejected a new contract offer from the General Motors Corporation late today and Robert White, a union leader, said ''it would take almost a miracle'' to avert a strike by the company's 36,000 Canadian workers Wednesday at noon. Company and union officials said a strike in Canada would force layoffs at some United States plants within a few days. Mr. White, the United Automobile Workers Canadian vice president, told reporters that the G.M. proposal on wages and other economic issues - presented here 20 hours before the strike deadline - was rejected unanimously by the union bargaining committee.
10/16/1984	OCT. 1-10 CAR SALES ROSE 4.1%	New-car sales in the Oct. 1-10 period rose 4.1 percent, on a sales-per-day basis, compared with the same period last year, the nation's six major manufacturers reported today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate, however, fell to 6.6 million units, from 6.7 million in the last 10 days of September and 7.9 million for the month as a whole, but analysts played down the significance of the decline, citing a distortion in the factors used to compute the rate. ''It used to be that because of the way new cars were introduced in the fall, with much anticipation and hoopla, sales were very strong in the last part of the year and the seasonal adjustment factors took that into effect,'' Ann Knight, an auto analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said. ''Certainly between now and the end of the year the seasonal adjustment factors will tend to penalize sales for the old- fashioned new model introduction, which no longer takes place.''
10/15/1984	G.M. Recalls 760,000 Autos To Replace Pollution Device	The General Motors Corporation is recalling 760,000 automobiles made in 1981 and 1982 because of faulty catalytic converters. The recall was ordered by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which had been investigating the cars for the past year.
10/15/1984	G.M. ACCORD IS SET	Negotiators for the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers reached agreement on a new labor contract this morning. Also today, union officials said a pact with the General Motors Corporation had been ratified by 57 percent of the rank and file. The tentative agreement with Ford came after a continuous 24-hour bargaining session. It was reached almost two days after an informal deadline set for noon Friday and closely parallels the accord reached last month at General Motors, officials of both sides said.
10/10/1984	CLOSE VOTES RAISE DOUBTS OVER FATE OF G.M. PACT	Ratification of the tentative contract between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers by rank-and-file members is still in doubt, union leaders acknowledged today. The union has refused to provide any details on the voting, which has been under way since last week, but unofficial tallies being kept by news organizations indicate that votes favoring the pact are running only slightly ahead of those for rejection. The Associated Press reported that, with 46 of 149 locals reporting, the vote was 33,957 in favor to 28,772 against. ''We're more optimistic today than before,'' said Donald F. Ephlin, head of the union's G.M. department. ''But it is still close enough that today and tomorrow could decide it.''
10/8/1984	7 UNION LOCALS REJECT GENERAL MOTORS OFFER	Workers at the Bowling Green, Ky., Corvette assembly plant rejected a United Automobile Workers contract with the General Motors Corporation today. It was the seventh local to reject the pact out of 13 tallied so far. One local leader attributed the votes to a $22 increase in yearly union dues.
10/7/1984	A NEW COOPERAION SWEEPS DETROIT	THE recent agreement between the United Auto Workers union and the General Motors Corporation defies judgment by old standards. It is neither a victory for one side nor a defeat for the other. It is, however, a landmark pact that shows labor and management in a new cooperative relationship. The union, rather than seeking wage increases, focused instead on job security - and acknowledged how crucial the company's financial health is to it. In this new partnership, the union agreed to the unusual steps of accepting bonuses in place of contractual wage increases - a Japanese practice - and it plans to work with G.M. to help build up the company's business.
10/4/1984	SEPT. 21-30 CAR SALES OFF 7.8%	Sales of new American-made autos fell 7.8 percent in the last 10 days of September, compared with the daily rate from the same period a year ago, auto makers reported today. Sales for the entire month, however, were up from those of a year ago. The decrease for the last period in September, only the second decline this year, was attributed to strikes by the United Automobile Workers union at some General Motors plants, which decreased car supplies as a new labor contract was being negotiated. The six-day strikes ended Sept. 21.
9/30/1984	SECURITY HEADS U.A.W.'S NEW AGENDA	Owen F. Bieber, the president of the United Auto Workers, outlined the approach at a strategy meeting of local union officials in late spring: ''Let's say we forget about job security and simply go for the money package. Well, we'd be suckers, because we'd have played into G.M.'s hands.'' Last week, those local leaders approved by a wide margin a tentative contract with a modest wage package but a central feature - a six-year job security program, backed by a $1 billion fund. It will insure employment or income maintenance for any General Motors factory worker with more than one year's seniority who is displaced by new technology or the shifting of production overseas, known in the industry as outsourcing.
9/28/1984	AUTO ACCORD: G.M. SIGNALS	An underlying theme of the tentative agreement between the United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation, a number of authorities say, is that the United States auto industry must shrink its labor force to become competitive with foreign manufacturers. Another theme, some experts say, is that both sides wish to expand the worker-participation program that G.M., like some companies in other industries, has established. ''In the last few years we've seen a more comprehensive and deep relation between labor and management'' at G.M., said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of the Automotive Industry. Mr. Cole said that the job security provisions of the new contract, which was approved by the union's local leaders Wednesday, addressed the ''serious issue of having more permanent employment relations.''
9/25/1984	G.M. Earnings to Be Diluted	The General Motors Corporation said its earnings would be reduced by about 99 cents a share for five years by its planned purchase of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation. G.M., in proxy materials dated last Friday, said it would write off about $2.2 billion over the five years, the difference between its purchase price for E.D.S. and the lower book, or accounting, value of the data-processing company's assets.
9/23/1984	HONDA CIVIC COUPE IS RATED BEST IN U.S. TEST FOR MILEAGE	A Honda model, for the second straight year, captured the best mileage ranking among automobiles sold in the United States, according to the annual ratings released today by the Environmental Protection Agency. Foreign-made engines, six of them diesels, powered all the 10 top mileage- yielding 1985 autos that will go on sale this fall. The two-seater Honda Civic Coupe HF recorded 49 miles per gallon in the environmental agency's city driving test and 54 m.p.g. in the highway test.
9/23/1984	PACT IN AUTO AND COAL INDUSTRIES VIEWED AS A BLOW TO INFLATION	Economists and labor experts said today that automobile workers and coal miners appeared to have struck the year's most effective blow against high inflation in the tentative contracts they had just reached. Initial reports of the separate agreements the unions reached Friday with the General Motors Corporation and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association indicate that both the United Automobile Workers and the United Mine Workers accepted wage increases averaging no more than 3 percent annually for three years. No details of the pacts were given when they were announced. If the contracts are ratified by the rank and file, that would be less than the inflation of 4.2 percent of the past 12 months, and far less than the contract increases, sometimes above 10 percent, that unions and companies routinely agreed upon in the 1970's. In the 1981-82 recession, with its soaring unemployment, workers in many industries accepted reductions in wages.
9/22/1984	GENERAL MOTORS AND UNION REACH TENTATIVE ACCORD	The United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation reached agreement early today on a tentative three-year contract providing wage increases, added pension benefits and job security. In another major settlement that includes new provisions to protect the jobs of workers threatened by layoffs, the United Mine Workers and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association agreed today on a 40-month contract. (Page 10.) The General Motors settlement, at the end of a 16-hour bargaining session, came six days after the union began selective strikes that shut down over half of the manufacturer's car and truck production, idling about 110,000 workers. The pact covers 350,000 workers.

9/22/1984	ANALYSTS SAY G.M. ACCORD WON'T WIDEN INDUSTRY GAP	The proposed settlement between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers should not put the company at any greater disadvantage in the worldwide automobile market, analysts for Wall Street said yesterday. Analysts also said an end to the selective strikes against General Motors after only six days would not result in any additional auto shortages in a market that has been unable to keep up with demand in the recent months of rapid economic recovery. ''The way that I would describe the settlement is that it is a moderate one,'' said Arvid Jouppi, an independent analyst in Detroit. ''I feel very positive that this is a good settlement for the company.''
9/22/1984	Late Selloff Hits Stocks; Dow Closes Down 14.80	Stock prices dropped yesterday in heavier trading, despite a cut in the prime rate by a major bank and the news that an agreement has been reached in the General Motors strike. The Dow Jones industrial average was on a seesaw, closing down 14.80 points, to 1,201.74, after being ahead almost 12 points at 11:30 A.M. The overall market did considerably better than the Dow average, with declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange only outscoring those that rose by 832 to 731. The early advance was fueled by the announcement of a three-year contract settlement between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union, which reduced concern that the recently intensifying slowdown in the economy may eventually result in a recession, and by Morgan Guaranty Trust's decision to cut its prime rate to 12 3/4 percent, from 13 percent. Report of Sales by Salomon Analysts said that the market's late weakness resulted from investors' disappointment that other major banks did not follow Morgan's lead, and by reports that Salomon Brothers Inc. had instituted a major sell program for several of its institutional clients. The investment firm declined to comment on the reports.
9/20/1984	AUTO TALKS AT STANDSTILL, WITH 91,000 NOW ON STRIKE	Negotiations between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers Union appeared to be at a standstill today as strikes and layoffs left almost one-third of the company's workforce idle. ''Virtually no progress was made in bargaining thus far today,'' the union said in a statement late this afternoon. The only meeting between bargainers was over ''minor items,'' the union said. Owen F. Bieber, the union president, spent much of the afternoon huddling with other officers of the union.
9/19/1984	AUTO PACT TALKS RECESS AS UNION EXTENDS STRIKES	Talks between the United Auto Workers union and the General Motors Corporation recessed early this morning with the union increasing the pressure on G.M. by authorizing approximately 30,000 more workers to begin strikes. The strike authorizations for four big union locals in Detroit, Indianapolis, Lansing, Mich., and Flint, Mich., came after the union made a counteroffer to the company that its leaders said was intended to bring an early end to the talks. However, G.M. did not accept the proposal and responded with its own offer about 9 P.M. Tuesday. The talks recessed about 1 A.M. today and were scheduled to resume at 9:30 A.M. The announcement of new strike authorizations means that close to 100,000 of G.M.'s 350,000 workers could be on strike at mid-week.
9/17/1984	PACT IS REACHED AT 1 OF 13 PLANTS	Negotiators for General Motors and the United Automobile Workers continued bargaining on national issues early today as about 58,000 workers prepared to prevent 11 plants from resuming production today. However, because bargainers were unable to reach an agreement early enough to notify workers, it appeared all but certain that a strike would continue even if an accord was reached before work was scheduled to begin. A settlement on local issues was reached Sunday night at a plant in California, one of 13 struck Friday, the union announced. The Associated Press quoted K. C. Beck, personnel director at the California plant, as saying the settlement had ''nothing to do with the national agreement.''
9/17/1984	ISSUES IN THE TALKS	The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest automobile company, and the United Automobile Workers, which represents 350,000 assembly line and skilled trades workers in 147 G.M. production plants and parts warehouses. Negotiations at the Ford Motor Company, where 114,000 are employed, have been suspended until there is a settlement at G.M. ISSUES - The union's two main objectives are winning a pay increase for members, who made wage and benefit concessions in 1982, and providing increased job security for workers.
9/16/1984	TALKS IN RECESS	The assembly lines at the huge Buick complex in Flint were silent today and pickets waved placards as the United Automobile Workers began selected local strikes at 13 General Motors plants. The union called the strikes, which are ostensibly over local issues, at plants in nine states shortly before midnight Friday, as the deadline for a national strike approached and negotiations remained stalled. Talks resumed at 11 this morning and continued until about 7:30 P.M. The union issued a statement saying, ''We have continued to bargain with the corporation today on the full range of issues, and we have made progress in some areas. Many differences remain, however.'' Union Pledges to Continue Talks The statement added, ''Our view is that it is best for both sides to break off until tomorrow morning. We shall resume early Sunday, and continue to work for as long as necessary.'' As has been the case the case since Monday, there was no comment from General Motors.
9/15/1984	AUTO TALKS TO RESUME AS STRIKES ARE CALLED AT SOME G.M. PLANTS	The United Auto Workers union decided late Friday to continue working without a contract at most General Motors plants after all-day negotiations failed to produce agreement on a new labor pact with the auto maker. But the national union authorized 13 local unions, with about 60,000 members in nine states, to strike over local issues if they chose. Since all 13 locals had previously voted to approve strikes, the decision was the equivalent of ordering strikes at those plants. There are about 350,000 union workers at the General Motors Corporation.
9/14/1984	AUTO WORKERS SPLIT OVER JOB SECURITY AND RAISES	Recessions and gasoline prices have devastated the domestic automobile industry in the 14 years since Kenneth Phipps walked into Cadillac's big Fleetwood plant, thinking he had found himself a lifetime job. In all that time, Cadillacs kept selling, Mr. Phipps kept working and job security was not something he worried about. ''Buicks, Chevies and others went through layoffs,'' he said Wednesday. ''We thought that when you built Cadillacs, you'd always have people in power who'll buy them. So we thought we'd never have to worry.''
9/14/1984	Photo of Owen Bieber (page A14); AUTO UNION FACES MIDNIGHT DEADLINE IN TALKS WITH G.M.	Negotiators for the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers worked tonight against a deadline of midnight Friday to reach agreement on a new labor contract to replace the concessions of 1982. Both union officials and industry analysts have called the talks the most critical in recent decades and have predicted that the outcome will have an important impact on the future of the American automobile industry. The talks continued in a closed meeting, with neither side providing much information on developments. General Motors said it made a wage offer shortly before noon but declined to provide any details. Progress Is Termed Slow Owen F. Bieber, president of the union, joined a group of pickets from a struck auto parts plant who were demonstrating in front of the General Motors building for a few minutes this afternoon. Asked about the progress of the talks, he replied tersely that the pace was still slow.
9/14/1984	Pact Reached With U.S. On Michigan Waste	The Justice Department has reached an agreement with 87 defendants, including the General Motors Corporation, to pay more than $14 million in cleanup costs at a hazardous waste site in Michigan.
9/14/1984	Sept. 1-10 Sales of New Cars Up 29.7%	The major American automobile manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars in the first 10 days of September rose 29.7 percent from the same period last year, on a daily rate basis. The average daily selling rate of 21,463 was the highest since 1979. The rate last year was 16,542, when sales were restrained by low inventory.
9/11/1984	G.M. OFFER PLAN ON JOB SECURITY, TOP UNION GOAL	The General Motors Corporation made an offer today to the United Automobile Workers that the company said ''supplies job security to a significant portion of our work force.'' Job security has been the No. 1 goal for the union in this year's round of contract talks because of the rapid changes taking place in the automobile industry, such as growing imports of cars and parts and advances in automation. The talks are focusing on G.M., which employs 350,000 union members. Alfred S. Warren Jr., G.M.'s vice president for industrial relations, declined to provide details on the offer, which he characterized as ''costly.'' He suggested that the union might have to make concessions on work rules, and possibly in other areas as well, to give the company flexibility to extend job assurances.
9/6/1984	AUG. 21-31 CAR SALES UP 11.6%	New-car sales rose 11.6 percent, on a daily selling rate basis, in the Aug. 21-31 period, the six major American manufacturers reported here today. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said dealers delivered a total of 237,078 new cars, bringing the seasonally adjusted annual rate to 7.8 million units. However, the adjusted rate for the entire month of August was 7.7 million units - down from 8.4 million in July and the lowest for any month this year, although much improved from August 1983, when it was 6.6 million. Industry analysts said the August decline, while slightly greater than some estimates, was expected because car sales have been higher than normal for several months. They said low inventory levels and spot shortages of the best-selling cars slowed August sales.
9/1/1984	G.M. RAISING 1985 MODEL PRICES 2.3%	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was increasing the average price of its 1985 model cars by $292, or 2.3 percent. The increase was similar to the 2.4 percent increase at the beginning of the 1984 model year, although the company later increased prices of some best-selling models. The increase, along with the resurgent popularity of big, option-laden cars, brings the price of the average- equipped 1985 model from G.M. at introduction to $12,931, up $1,325 from the average of $11,606 at the end of the 1984 model year. The average price of G.M. cars is higher than industrywide averages because of the company's disproportionately big share of the large and luxury market.
8/30/1984	UNION PICKS TWO AUTO MAKERS AS STRIKE TARGETS	The United Automobile Workers today chose both Ford and General Motors as strike targets in the current negotiations for a new labor contract. However, Owen F. Bieber, the union president, was given the authority to designate one of the two companies as a strike target as the talks moved closer to Sept. 15, the expiration of the current contract. The decision by the union's leadership represents a departure from past practice. In most cases, only one of the auto companies has been chosen the focus of negotiations, to increase the pressure on it to grant the union's demands.
8/29/1984	G.M. AND FORD MAKE OFFERS BUT THE UNION SPURNS THEM	General Motors and Ford made their first offers today in contract talks with the United Automobile Workers. Both were quickly denounced as ''meager'' and ''inadequate'' by union leaders. The two proposals, while different, emphasized profit-sharing rather than wage increases and provided few of the assurances the union was seeking to prevent job losses through overseas production or by new technology. Union officials said the wide gap between what the companies were offering and what the union had demanded earlier would make it more difficult to reach an agreement by Sept. 15, the strike deadline.
8/28/1984	8 G.M. Plants to Stay Open As Pollution Controls Go In	The General Motors Corporation and the Federal Government agreed today that eight automobile assembly plants could remain open while the automaker installs $80 million worth of equipment to prevent the discharge of hazardous heavy metals and organic wastes.
8/28/1984	CORRECTION	A dispatch from Washington Thursday about investigations into reported problems with brakes in General Motors X-model cars contained two inaccuracies. It should have said that a Federal case against General Motors focused on allegations that the brakes had a tendency to lock, not that Federal officials had found a high incidence of brakes locking. Also, the case is a civil suit, not a criminal action.
8/28/1984	Paralyzed Man and G.M. Settle Trans Am Suit	General Motors and lawyers for a paralyzed 22-year-old man reached a settlement today in a $50 million lawsuit that charged the company manufactured an unsafe Pontiac Trans Am. The lawyers refused to disclose the terms, but both sides said they were pleased.
8/27/1984	OPEL STRATEGY TIED TO SPORTY NEW CAR	Adam Opel A.G., the European subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, is introducing a model next month that highlights broad changes in the company's production and design strategies. The new model may help the company reverse a slide in its key West German market. The car, to be built in West Germany, Belgium and Britain, is an updated version of Opel's popular Kadett, known in Britain as the Astra. The Kadett is a four-year-old workhorse that accounts for about 35 percent of the company's European sales.
8/27/1984	New Deutsch Accounts	David Deutsch Associates has added three new accounts with combined billings of $2 million.
8/24/1984	U.S. CAR SALES UP 32.1% IN AUG. 10-20 PERIOD	Sales of new American-made automobiles bounced back in the second 10 days of August, with the six major manufacturers today reporting an increase of 32.1 percent, on a daily selling rate basis, from the same period last year. The daily rate of 23,651 sales was the highest since 1979. Sales were down slightly in the first 10 days of this month, as inventory levels continued to fall below desired levels. Most of the auto makers have closed some operations to change over to 1985 models. The annual rate of sales, seasonally adjusted, rose to 8.1 million domestic units, from 7.4 million in the Aug. 1-10 period, and up from a 6.6 million rate last year at this time.
8/24/1984	NEW SPIRIT AT AN AUTO PLANT	Roscoe Dye, a 47-year-old auto worker, spent part of his day recently trying to assemble a truck. He was not working with steel, but with building blocks from a children's toy called Lego. It was one of many tests Mr. Dye had to pass in a four-day screening process before he was hired by Nummi, which is more formally known as New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the company born of General Motors' and Toyota's joint venture here. In the Lego exercise, said D. William Childs, Nummi's general manager of human resources, one person tells another how to assemble a truck, but the instructor is not allowed to use his hands. The purpose is to see how well applicants work together, to measure their creativity and to evaluate their leadership abilities.
8/23/1984	G.M. WITHHELD BRAKE DATA IN 2D INQUIRY, OFFICIAL SAYS	A senior Government safety official has accused General Motors of improperly withholding documents from a second investigation into possible safety problems with brakes in the company's 1980 middle-size automobiles. George L. Parker, chief of enforcement for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the auto maker had failed to provide 18 company documents for a study of allegations that certain 1980 models sometimes lacked enough engine vacuum to operate power-assisted brakes without intense foot pressure. The Government has also been seeking a recall of more than a million of the X-model cars because its studies have found a high incidence of the rear brakes' locking and causing dangerous skids. Mr. Parker's charges, which were made a year ago but became known only recently, concern an entirely separate investigation of the power-assist question. The Justice Department has filed a criminal action charging General Motors with trying to conceal the problem of rear-brake lockup. It was in reviewing material supplied in response to a subpoena in that case that Mr. Parker discovered the 18 documents that he says should have been provided for the investigation of the brakes' power assistance.
8/16/1984	GENERAL MOTORS PROPOSES CHANGES IN ITS EMPLOYEE HEALTH PROGRAM	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was seeking a major revision in the way it administers the nation's largest nongovernmental program of health care benefits. It was the automobile maker's first formal proposal toward a new contract with the United Automobile Workers, whose contracts with G.M. and the Ford Motor Company expire Sept. 14. Alfred S. Warren Jr., the company's vice president for industrial relations, said that G.M. proposed to offer each employee a choice of three options: a new network of ''preferred providers'' of health care, consisting of clinics and hospitals under contract to G.M.; an expanded system of health maintenance organizations, which handle all of a subscriber's health needs for a fixed fee, or a modified version of the current medical insurance system with stricter safeguards against potential abuses. The union's reaction was conciliatory. ''I think this is a positive approach to a serious problem,'' said Donald Ephlin, a U.A.W. vice president.
8/11/1984	AUTO PLANTS TRY TEAMWORK	Every morning at 8:30, the members of Work Group 17-25 at the General Motors assembly plant here walk to their meeting area and turn on the television set to watch the company's version of the morning news. The show is a 10-minute roundup of production and quality control figures from the previous day, announcements of employee birthdays, the weather and any special events around the plant, which opened last December. The broadcast is repeated during work breaks. While the broadcast departs from Detroit's hierarchical assembly-line tradition, little about Work Group 17- 25 draws on that tradition. Throughout the day, the group members work as a team on the same kinds of jobs - some interchangeably - assembling Oldsmobile 98's and Cadillac Fleetwoods and DeVilles. They may bring lunch from the cafeteria and eat together at their ''work group meeting areas,'' a glassed-in booth with picnic tables and chairs, a blackboard, a bulletin board and the television set. And their supervisor is not a foreman, but a ''group manager,'' aided by a ''coordinator,'' an hourly employee who is elected by the group.
8/7/1984	MORE ANALYSTS BULLISH ON G.M.	SOUND too good to be true? A giant industry leader with two dividend increases since November, rapidly rising profits, a treasure chest of cash and its common stock selling at less than five times estimated earnings for 1984 normally might be considered an attractive investment. Until recently, the shares of the General Motors Corporation, which fit this description, were distinct market laggards. In late July, G.M.'s stock languished below 65. Investors chose to shun the issue as they focused instead on such negatives as fear of a strike later this year, a falloff in profits after 1985 and the company's ongoing competition with Japanese auto makers. Then, too, stock buyers in general seemed to go on strike earlier this summer.
8/7/1984	Hang On to the Fuel Standards	Citing the slow sales of fuel-efficient vehicles, Ford and General Motors want the Government to lower its fuel-mileage standards for light trucks. If they succeed, they will almost surely ask for similar relief for autos. The companies make one sound argument. They could probably sell cars that comply with existing standards if gasoline prices had risen - or been raised by taxes - to the levels expected by Government when the standards were set.
8/4/1984	JULY 21-31 AUTO SALES SHOW INCREASE OF 15.7%	Sales by the six major domestic automobile manufacturers rose 15.7 percent in the July 21-31 period, the best performance for the period since 1979, the car makers reported today. Analysts cited recent favorable economic factors for the sales strength. They added, however, that the pace was not likely to be sustained much longer because of diminishing inventories. ''Consumers have every reason to be out there buying cars,'' said John Hammond, an analyst with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ''Inflation's low, interest rates have stopped rising for the moment, and it looks like there's a price break in the energy market. The problem is that the manufacturers just do not have the cars.''
8/2/1984	G.M. TO INVEST IN ROBOT 'EYES'	The General Motors Corporation, in another effort to speed new technology into its factories, said today that it would purchase minority interests in three companies that produce machine-vision systems that can automatically inspect parts as they go down an assembly line and that act as ''eyes'' for industrial robots. The move appeared to be an effort by the auto giant to develop, and to lock up for its own use, advanced manufacturing processes specifically tailored to the auto industry. Today's announcements were the latest in a recent series of investments and acquisitions by G.M., all of which have been in advanced technology areas. Development Funds Included Under the agreements, G.M. will acquire as much as 20 percent of Automatix Inc. of Billerica, Mass.; up to 20 percent of View Engineering of Simi Valley, Calif., and up to 30 percent of Diffracto Ltd. of Windsor, Ontario. G.M. will pay $12.1 million for the first 10 percent of Automatix. No terms were given for its investments in the other two companies, which are privately held.
8/1/1984	REAGAN ASKS RESTRAINT BY UNION	President Reagan has injected himself into the automobile labor negotiations, calling on the United Automobile Workers to use ''some restraint'' in demands this summer. If the union does otherwise, Mr. Reagan said, it could endanger ''the recovery, the expansion that we're having.''
7/31/1984	G.M. Adjusts Prices Of Some '84 Models	The General Motors Corporation increased the price of two of its better-selling models today and announced price reductions for the slow-selling diesel- engines option and domestically made economy cars. The company also made some previously optional equipment standard and increased the sticker prices accordingly. The changes in the price of these 1984 models come just a few weeks before the company will have to set at least tentative prices on its 1985 models for fleet sales. And they come just after the beginning of negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union, which has pledged to win a commitment from G.M. to hold down prices.
7/12/1984	AUTO MAKERS HOPING STATE LAWS SAVE THEM FROM AIR BAG RULING	The nation's three leading automobile manufacturers said today that they hoped enough states would pass seat belt legisation to allow them to avoid installing air bags in some of their 1987 model cars. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler criticized a Federal regulation requiring air bags or automatic seat belts in 10 percent of their 1987 cars, and said they would lobby legislatures to enact mandatory seat belt laws. If states with two-thirds of the nation's population do so, the air bag regulation would be dropped. The manufacturers also said they would concentrate on improving the crashworthiness of their cars with new designs and materials.
7/9/1984	AUTO MAKERS TURN TO KOREA	American auto makers are again looking to the Far East to find a nation that offers low labor costs, a well- educated and hard-working labor force and a government that encourages big business. But it is not Japan that has drawn their attention this time, but South Korea. In June, the General Motors Corporation and the Daewoo Motor Company signed a $426 million agreement to produce 167,000 cars a year in South Korea by 1987. About half those cars will be exported, with many expected to be distributed in the United States by the Pontiac Division of General Motors.
7/7/1984	Opel Estimates Cost of Strike	Adam Opel A.G., a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, said today that the recently ended strike by metalworkers had cost it sales of 2 billion marks, or about $707 million. An Opel spokesman said the 50-day strike had stopped the auto maker from building 121,462 cars that would normally have been assembled during that period.
7/6/1984	REAGAN TELLING CROWDS '84 IS 'WONDERFUL TIME'	With observations that God's existence is doubted less and the flag is respected more, President Reagan's opening message on the 1984 campaign trail could not be more basic. ''This is a wonderful time to be alive,'' he is telling the voters in his first extended political trip of the summer. Facing blue-collar workers near a busy assembly line here today and a happy crowd of family picnickers in Alabama Wednesday evening, the President invoked the bedrock political verities of God and the flag, the family and freedom as he fashioned his personal inclination toward optimism into a campaign vehicle. ''We're seeing a new respect for family and neighborhood,'' Mr. Reagan told the auto workers here at the dedication of a new General Motors plant. ''Remember when it was fashionable to claim that God is dead? Well, today I think we're seeing that He is alive and well in the hearts of our people.''
7/5/1984	AUTO WORKERS AWAIT REAGAN VISIT	In the summer of 1980, after more than a decade of bolting armrests onto automobile doors on one General Motors assembly line or another, Rich Kaltner was laid off. So was Mark Thornberry, whose job was stretching fabric for seat covers. That November, the two men voted for President Carter. Then they went home to wait for a call that did not come until last winter, when General Motors hired thousands of unemployed auto workers for a big, new luxury car plant in this rapidly growing township 30 miles from Detroit.
7/5/1984	Market Place; G.M. Attracts More Interest	THE General Motors Corporation's planned acquisition of Electronic Data Systems may not add much right away to G.M.'s prodigious earnings flow, but it apparently is causing some investors to give the auto giant's stock a second look. Last Thursday, when the $2.55 billion deal was announced, G.M.'s shares jumped 1 1/4, to 65 1/4. And the stock has pushed ahead another 5/8 point since then, closing Tuesday at 65 7/8. The spurt was one of the few signs of life G.M.'s shares have shown since the stock was trading around 80 earlier this year. Although there are some concerns about G.M.'s outlook, including a fear that rising interest rates could curb auto demand, many analysts and money managers say the stock should never have taken such a tumble.
7/4/1984	FISHER UNIT BREAKUP COMPLETED	The General Motors Corporation took another major step today in the sweeping reorganization of its North American automotive operations by announcing it had completed the breakup of its historic Fisher Body division. G.M. said that eight parts-making plants of the Fisher division had been combined with the Guide division, a producer of headlights and plastic parts, to form the Fisher Guide division. Other plants formerly operated by Fisher have been split among the two new automotive groups in the company - the Chevrolet-Pontiac and G.M. of Canada group and the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group - and other components operations.
7/4/1984	G.M. Modernizing	The General Motors Corporation has started a $154 million modernization project at its 65-year-old iron foundry after receiving a tax abatement from Saginaw and concessions from the United Automobile Workers union on job classifications. About $39 million will be spent installing a modern production line, said William O'Neill, a G.M. spokesman. Mr. O'Neill said employment, now at 3,300, would drop to about 2,350 during the project. Plans call for it to rise again to 3,000 at the plant, which makes cylinder blocks, brake drums, rotors and camshafts.
7/2/1984	Clients Added by Chiat, Muller and Deutsch	Last week ended with new business announcements from Chiat/Day, Muller Jordan Weiss and David Deutsch Associates. For Chiat/Day it was Barney's, the 60-year-old retail clothier, whose advertising account was previously at Epstein Raboy Advertising for three and a half years.
6/29/1984	G.M. ENTERING COMPUTER FIELD ON MAJOR SCALE	The General Motors Corporation moved today to take a major role in the electronics industry by agreeing to pay $2.5 billion for the data-processing company founded by H. Ross Perot, the Dallas billionaire. The acquisition of Mr. Perot's company, Electronic Data Systems Inc., would be G.M.'s biggest ever, and its first in the computer-services area. Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman, has said several times in recent months that the huge auto maker intended to diversify out of its primary business. The auto maker has more than $9 billion cash on hand as a result of the recent sharp upturn in auto sales, giving it the means for the deal.
6/26/1984	U.S. CAR SALES RISE BY 12.4%	Sales of new American-made cars in the mid-June period increased 12.4 percent over last year, auto makers reported here today. The increase was based on average daily sales, which were at the highest level for the period since 1978. The six major domestic companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold a total of 259,844 new cars, or 28,872 a day, against 205,444, or 25,681 daily, in the comparable 1983 period. There were nine selling days in the June 11-20 period this year and eight last year.
6/22/1984	RECALL ORDERED FOR G.M. CARS	The Environmental Protection Agency today ordered the General Motors Corporation to recall about 550,000 1980- model automobiles that have exhaust emissions exceeding Federal standards on nitrogen oxides. The agency said its investigation showed that the emissions were not within the the Government's 1980 standards because the vehicles' exhaust gas recirculation systems were defective.
6/14/1984	EARLY JUNE AUTO SALES UP BY 0.3%	The six major American auto manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars edged up only three-tenths of 1 percent in early June from the 1983 period. The sales are figured on a daily selling rate basis. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, American Honda and Volkswagen of America - said sales totaled 187,482 units in the June 1-10 period, or 23,435 units a day, compared with 210,188 and a rate of 23,353 daily a year earlier. There were eight selling days in the 1984 period versus nine last year.
6/6/1984	CAR SALES JUMPED 19.1% IN LAST 10 DAYS OF MAY	New-car sales in the last 10 days of May rose 19.1 percent from the 1983 period on a daily selling rate basis, the major manufacturers reported here today. The daily rate of 37,582 was the highest for the period since 1978. Analysts expressed surprise at the sales figures, which were stronger than anticipated for both the end of the month and all of May. Sales in the month were also the highest since 1978.
6/5/1984	G.M. Military Plan	The General Motors Corporaton said it was creating a Military Vehicles Operation to develop products and expand the company's role as a military supplier. The new effort will be based at G.M.'s Technical Center in Warren, Mich., with additional facilities at the Allison Gas Turbine division in Indianapolis and at the Delco Systems Operation in Santa Barbara, Calif., the company said in a statement. G.M. now makes a commercial utility cargo vehicle for the Army. Its contract calls for delivery of more than 53,000 trucks over three years, with options for the Army to double that number.
5/31/1984	GERMAN STRIKE SLOWING EUROPEAN AUTO OUTPUT	A strike by West German metalworkers for a 35-hour workweek is gradually crippling wide sectors of Europe's auto industry, including the subsidiaries of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation. The stoppages come as Europe's auto industry is emerging from a prolonged slump, and analysts say new approaches to inventory management instituted to deal with the industry's problems have exacerbated the impact. The strikes also cast a shadow over Germany's economic recovery, which has been sparked in large measure by sales of consumer goods, including automobiles.
5/22/1984	G.M. Will Retool Westchester Plant	The General Motors Corporation's troubled North Tarrytown assembly plant, which has been operating at half capacity for 20 months, will be retooled before the end of the year to manufacture a different model of car, the company said yesterday. Workers at the plant, who had feared it might soon be closed, regarded the decision as good news.
5/21/1984	AN IMAGE PROBLEM FOR DETROIT	To some people, the decision of General Motors and Ford, the two largest automobile makers, to pay record bonuses to their executives while enjoying protection from Japanese competition is a symbol of management high-handedness that may cause political problems for all of corporate America. The auto bonuses, in the two weeks since they were disclosed, have stirred a storm of protests that Detroit seems to be feathering its own nest. Executives of the auto companies acknowledge that they expected a hostile reaction to the payments, which put the compensation of top officers of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company well over $1 million each for 1983. Matching Other Industries But they say that high pay for key executives is standard in American business and that to leave auto executives' compensation below the levels of other manufacturing industries would risk seeing their most talented people go find better pay elsewhere. Allan Gilmour, Ford's vice president for external affairs, said public reaction was considered before the bonuses were paid.
5/19/1984	GENERAL MOTORS GOES COURTING	It might have been Fay Wray describing how King Kong had come calling at the stake: ''When a company the size of G.M. approaches,'' H. Ross Perot, the founder and controlling stockholder of Dallas-based Electronic Data Systems told a business group Thursday, ''you have to consider it. We were flattered that they came to us.'' Thus did Mr. Perot, a colorful Texas entrepreneur who once bankrolled and organized a raid on an Iranian prison to free two of his employees, confirm widespread rumors that the giant General Motors Corporation had come courting his $2 billion E.D.S. several weeks before. The object: combination of an unspecified nature.
5/18/1984	Talks With Electronic Data	The General Motors Corporation has opened discussions about the possibility of purchasing the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, according to a report published today. H. Ross Perot, founder and chairman of E.D.S., earlier confirmed that the company was discussing the possibility of a friendly acquisition by an unnamed company, but he said he did not want to sell.
5/16/1984	May 1-10 Auto Sales Jumped 25.5%	New-car sales in the first 10 days of May jumped 25.5 percent from the period a year earlier, the nation's major manufacturers reported today. The increase was on a daily rate basis, with nine selling days in the period this year and eight a year ago. The companies, G.M., Ford, Chrysler, A.M.C., Honda and VW, sold 238,240 automobiles in the May 1-10 period, or 26,471 a day. That was the highest daily rate for the period since 1979. Last year the six car makers delivered 168,785 units, or 21,098 a day.
5/10/1984	WESTCHESTER FIGHTS TO KEEP BLUE-COLAR JOBS	In the 20 months since the General Motors Corporation canceled the second shift at its assembly plant here, the survival of one of the largest bluecollar employers in the suburbs of New York City has been in doubt. Automobile assembly plants, like other smoke-billowing manufacturing concerns, tend to be short-lived when they are used at only half capacity. And now, after being offered a long list of economic incentives from the state, General Motors must decide whether to make a huge investment in its plant here or close it down. Efforts by state and local officials to keep the plant, designed to employ 5,000 workers, have been intensified by the fear that its loss would do irreversible damage to the suburban economy.
5/10/1984	26,000 Porsches Recalled Along With 357 Chevrolets	Volkswagen of America said Tuesday it was recalling 26,000 Porsche sports cars and Chevrolet announced it was recalling 357 of its 1984 Celebrity midsize automobiles. Volkswagen's recall involves Porsches manufactured since 1982 that are equipped with the wrong kind of rear seat-belt systems.
5/8/1984	G.M. Dividend	The General Motors Corporation's board declared a second-quarter dividend of $1.25 a share.
5/4/1984	LATE-APRIL AUTO SALES ROSE 36.6%	Sales of new cars by the nation's major manufacturers rose 36.6 percent in the last 10 days of April from a year earlier, the companies reported today. The increase was measured on a daily rate basis, with eight selling days in the period this year and nine last year. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate, which has been bouncing up and down the last two months, rose to 8.3 million in the April 21-30 period, from 7.7 million in mid-April, to reach 8.1 million for the month, about what analysts had expected. Ann Knight, an auto analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, said: ''These are good strong sales. They are sustainable. When we are in a period resembling normal demand, as we are now, you're going to see some fluctuation from one 10-day period to the next. Between now and the end of the second quarter, anything between a 7.5-million and 8.5-million rate will not surprise me.''
5/3/1984	G.M.'S SILICON VALLEY STAKE	For the first time since the early days of the auto industry, the General Motors Corporation has bought a minority interest in a small company rather than swallowing it whole. Last week, in a little-noticed move, G.M. paid $3 million for an 11 percent interest in Teknowledge Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., a small computer company that specializes in applications of artificial intelligence. To the auto giant, $3 million is cash for postage stamps. In this case, however, it is a small bet on what could be a major technological advance. The goal, G.M. officials said, is to develop automated systems that can diagnose problems in the increasingly complex cars of the future.
5/2/1984	G.M., Toyota Pick LOF	LOF Glass, a division of the Libbey- Owens-Ford Company, will supply all the glass for the General Motors Corporation venture with the Toyota Motor Company, a Libbey-Owens- Ford official said today. LOF will supply laminated windshields and tempered side and back windows made at its Lathrop, Calif., facility.
4/14/1984	EARLY APRIL AUTO SALES UP BY 33.2%	Sales of new American-made automobiles jumped 33.2 percent in the first 10 days of April, the six major manufacturers reported today. The daily selling rate of 26,299 was the highest for any early-April period since 1979. Sales in the period rose to 210,395 from 157,875 a year earlier, putting the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate at 8.3 million, up from a 6.6 million rate a year ago and 7.9 million for the past month.
4/12/1984	G.M.-Toyota Deal Approved WASHINGTON, April 11	The General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation got the Government's approval today to proceed with a plan to jointly build small cars at a former G.M. assembly plant in Fremont, Calif. The Federal Trade Commission, on a 3-to-2 vote, made permanent the provisional approval it had granted the project last December.
4/11/1984	GM AGENCY EXPANDS ITS INQUIRY ON BRAKING SYSTEMS TO FORD	The Government, already pressing a suit to have 1.1 million General Motors automobiles recalled because of brakes that lock prematurely, today announced an investigation into reports of similar problems in 431,000 Ford cars. The investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is concentrated on 1979 Ford Mustangs and Mercury Capris. The agency received 160 complaints about brakes locking.
4/10/1984	NEW WAYS AT 2 G.M. PLANTS	Tall and silent, except for a faint beeping tone to warn the unwary, 22 unmanned forklift trucks roll heavily along the aisles of the General Motors Corporation's automobile plant here, bringing parts to workers along the assembly line. The computer-controlled vehicles, which follow wires buried in the floor, are just one of the departures from old-fashioned car assembly incorporated in the plant, which began production late last year. The Orion facility, about 30 miles north of Detroit, and a nearly identical one outside St. Louis, in Wentzville, Mo., represent a combined $1.2 billion investment in tools and buildings by G.M. to try to improve the quality of its products and to cut costs. The vast new plants - Orion is half a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide - are now producing Cadillac DeVilles, Oldsmobile 98's and Buick Electras, the new generation of smaller front-wheel-drive luxury cars that were introduced last week.
4/6/1984	G.M. TELLS A STORY IN AD SERIES	THE General Motors public relations department a year ago engineered the corporation's first sponsorship of a television program. And it was to be a big one: a dramatization of the life of George Washington, a three-night miniseries on the CBS-TV network. While various divisions have sponsored shows, the corporate parent had never undertaken such a project. A total of 48 minutes of advertising during the three nights would be spread among the various divisions, with the corporate public relations department getting 16 minutes. The question became how to make the best use of the current advertising theme, ''Nobody sweats the details like G.M.''
4/5/1984	LATE MARCH AUTO SALES ROSE 18.7%	The nation's major domestic auto makers said today that new car sales in the last 10 days of March rose 18.7 percent from a year earlier, to the best end-of- March selling total since 1981. At the same time, the auto makers said, sales for the entire month rose 26 percent from a year earlier, to the best total for March since 1979. ''These sales looked fine,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an automotive industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. Mr. Phillippi said sales should remain high through this summer because of the large number of consumers who have yet to buy new cars in the current recovery. The six companies - G.M., Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold 313,443 new cars in the March 21-31 period, up from 263,963 a year earlier. For the month, the companies reported sales of 756,164, up from 600,303.
4/3/1984	Suzuki Ships Cars to G.M.	The Suzuki Motor Company has shipped the first load of 1.0-liter subcompact cars for the General Motors Corporation, a Suzuki official said today. The first shipload of 900 fuel- efficient, 60-horsepower cars, called the Cultus, left for the United States from central Japan on Sunday, he said.
4/3/1984	Cadillac's Prices	The General Motors Corporation raised the price of its new, front-wheel drive Cadillac DeVille by $344, to $17,472, and cut the price of the bigger, redesigned Cadillac Fleetwood. The Fleetwood will now have a sticker price of $20,402, down $37 from its previous price.
3/30/1984	M.T.A. TO BUY 400 NEW BUSES FOR $68 MILLION	The Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted yesterday to spend $68 million to buy 400 new buses. The decision is part of a plan to replace the 851 Grumman Flxible buses taken out of service last month for safety reasons. Delivery of the new buses - General Motors Model RTS-04's, a model that has been in service on New York streets for three years - should begin no later than Aug. 17, officials said.
3/28/1984	G.M.'S LUXURY-CAR GAMBLE	General Motors' latest and perhaps most important gamble, analysts and company executives say, is that buyers will accept the smaller size and wedge shape of its top-of-the-line luxury cars being introduced this week. Within the company they are called the ''C'' bodies. In dealers' showrooms they will be the new Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood, Oldsmobile 98 and Buick Electra. The gamble is especially important for G.M. since this is the second generation and most radical downsizing of its largest and most profitable cars.
3/27/1984	Advertising; Buick Campaigns On Pricing	-based Shiffman/ Ferguson/Stone is an agency whose foundations are built upon Buick dealer association advertising, which constitutes about 40 percent of its billings. So you can imagine how carefully the New Jersey agency listened when its biggest client
3/27/1984	'85 CADILLAC FACES GAS GUZZLER LABEL	The 1985 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham model may be the first American automobile to be sold to the public that would be labeled a ''gas guzzler'' by the Federal Government. Starting next fall, buyers would have to pay a $500 tax because the car's mileage rating apparently will not meet the 21.5 miles per gallon combined city and highway driving rating specified by Federal law. Cadillac officials said their tests indicated that the 1985 model will have a fuel economy rating as much as 0.2 miles per gallon short of the standard, which has been gradually rising from 15 miles per gallon in 1980 to a final 22.5 miles per gallon in 1986 and beyond.
3/27/1984	G.M.-Toyota Deal Gains	The Federal Trade Commission staff has recommended that the agency grant final approval to the proposed joint car-making venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation, an F.T.C. source said today. G.M. and Toyota hope to build up to 250,000 cars annually at an idle GM plant in Fremont, Calif., starting late this year.
3/24/1984	MID-MARCH AUTO SALES UP BY 33.7%	New-car sales in mid-March rose 33.7 percent over the same selling period last year, the nation's six major manufacturers reported today. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - reported sales of 231,481 cars in the March 11-20 period, up from 173,125 in the 1983 period, when Honda was not yet producing in this country. Both periods had eight selling days.
3/15/1984	MARCH 1-10 AUTO SALES ROSE 31.5%	The nation's six major auto makers reported today that sales in the March 1-10 period surged 31.5 percent from a year earlier, continuing the stronger- than-expected pace that has prevailed since December. Analysts and industry executives said the early-March figures showed that sales could be expected to remain strong for the remainder of the model year. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold 211,240 cars in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last, when they sold 160,617. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate was 8.1 million domestic units in the period. Most analysts had expected sales in the first quarter of about 7.5 to 7.8 million domestically produced units, but an 8.3 million rate for the month of January and an 8.5 million rate in February caused some to revise their forecasts for the year and brought about some minor adjustments in production schedules by the manufacturers for the second quarter.
3/14/1984	GENERAL MOTORS CALLS X-CARS SAFE	The General Motors Corporation argued today that its 1980 X-cars, which the Government says have defective rear braking systems, are among the safest automobiles on the highway, but the Government said it wanted all the cars recalled. In opening arguments in Federal District Court, a company attorney, Thomas A. Gottschalk, said the auto maker would introduce evidence showing that the 1980 X-cars had been built without safety defects. Last August the Justice Department, acting for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, sued General Motors seeking the recall of 1.1 million 1980 X-body cars and $4 million in damages, charging that the the manufacturer intentionally tried to cover up the brake deficiency.
3/12/1984	TRIAL OVER X-CARS OPENS THIS WEEK	Trial of a civil suit brought by the Justice Department is scheduled to begin in Federal District Court this week. In the suit, the United States seeks more than $4 million in penalties from the General Motors Corporation, which is charged with building 1.1 million defective 1980 X-cars. The Government asserts that G.M. knew the cars had defective brakes but manufactured them anyway. It also charges the company with failing to recall the cars to fix the defects.
3/12/1984	CORPORATE-GIANT LIST CHANGES	Vigorous economic growth throughout 1983 has shaken up the rankings of the nation's 25 largest nonfinancial corporations. And, as a result of regulatory changes and merger decisions, the list of America's biggest companies is almost certain to undergo even more dramatic change this year. As in years past, the names of big oil companies continued to dominate the overall rankings in terms of revenues and net income. But after a second consecutive year of soft prices, the petroleum industry's grip on the top spots has weakened.
3/7/1984	G.M., Daewoo To Build Car	The General Motors Corporation said that it had signed a memorandum of agreement with the Daewoo Corporation, a South Korean conglomerate, to produce a small Opel automobile beginning in the 1987 model year. The company said a new plant in Bupyeong, South Korea, near Seoul, would be able to produce 167,000 cars annually.
3/6/1984	FEB. 21-29 AUTO SALES ROSE 24.6%	The nation's major automobile manufacturers reported today that sales rose 24.6 percent, on a daily rate basis, in late February. The companies, G.M., Ford, Chrysler, A.M.C., VW and Honda, sold a total of 248,062 units in the Feb. 21-29 period, which had eight selling days this year and seven last year. Sales for the entire month of February, with 25 selling days this year and 24 last year, were up 42.5 percent, to 655,016. The daily selling rate of 26,201 was the best daily rate for February since 1979. Last year the car makers sold 441,226 cars, or 18,384 a day, in the month.
3/3/1984	AUTO WORKERS TO STATE GOALS FOR NEW PACTS	''This seat was made for you on the day shift by Team 7 at Fisher Body, Flint,'' reads a small sticker attached to the rear ashtray of some new Buick automobiles. The sticker, put on the seats made by three-worker assembly groups at the General Motors Corporation's Fisher Body plant in Flint, Mich., is an indication of efforts the auto maker has made in recent years to improve labor relations by fostering team spirit. It is also meant to convince consumers that they are not buying cars made by disgruntled, sloppy workers. Whether these beginnings of a more cooperative attitude between the world's largest automobile company and its workers will survive this summer is in some doubt as the company and the United Automobile Workers brace for what is expected to be a difficult round of negotiations on a new contract to replace the one that expires Sept. 14.
3/2/1984	G.M. in Pact With Daewoo	F. James McDonald, president of the General Motors Corporation, said today that G.M. and the Daewoo Motor Company had agreed to build a new small car in South Korea that could eventually be exported to the United States. ''We have either concluded or are close to concluding an agreement with Daewoo to produce a new car in Korea for the Korean market,'' Mr. McDonald said.
2/28/1984	G.M. Set to Recall 7,200 Employees	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would recall another 7,200 workers by June, bringing to 90,000 the total number called back by the company since January 1983, the peak month of unemployment in the automobile industry. F. James McDonald, G.M.'s president, said 2,900 employees would return to assembly plants and 4,300 to component operations.
2/22/1984	OLDS: A CONTINUING SUCCESS	Joseph J. Sanchez is in an unusual position for an American automobile executive these days. While most of his colleagues have to justify what went wrong with the domestic auto industry, the manager of Oldsmobile is busy explaining why things are so good. Last year the Oldsmobile division of the General Motors Corporation sold 1,007,559 cars and accounted for 11 percent of the total automobile market. Ten years ago, the division held just a 5.9 percent share of the market, but it has climbed steadily since then.
2/19/1984	DOCUMENT BY G.M. SHOWS LABOR PLAN	The General Motors Corporation will seek to eliminate annual wage increases for its blue- collar factory workers in favor of a profit-sharing plan in contract talks later this year, according to an internal company document made public by the United Automobile Workers. The company also hopes to reduce its unionized work force from the present level of about 370,000 to under 300,000 within three years, and would like to hire new workers at wage and benefit levels lower than the present union scale, according to the document. The union and G.M. are scheduled to begin bargaining on a new contract this summer to replace one negotiated in the auto sales slump in 1982 that eliminated the 3 percent annual wage increases that have been given for more than 30 years and contained other concessions from workers. The contract expires Sept. 15.
2/15/1984	FEB. 1-10 AUTO SALES ROSE 32.6%	Sales of new American-made automobiles rose 32.6 percent in the first 10 days of February from the corresponding period last year, the manufacturers reported today. The six major companies, General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen and American Honda, sold 181,694 cars in the Feb. 1-10 period, or 20,188 daily, the best daily selling rate for the early February period since 1979. The companies sold 137,078 cars in Feb. 1-10, 1983. There were nine selling days in both periods.
2/9/1984	G.M.-TOYOTA VENTURE CRITICIZED BY IACOCCA	Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, said today that 300,000 American jobs would be lost if the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation were allowed to jointly build small cars. Mr. Iacocca described the G.M.- Toyota plan as ''patently illegal'' in testimony before a House Commerce subcommittee. He added that if the deal was consummated, Chrysler might be forced to build its small cars in South Korea or Mexico to compete.
2/8/1984	G.M. EARNS $1.3 BILLION IN QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation reported today that it earned a record $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 1983, almost nine times as much as in the comparable 1982 period, and a turnaround from three years ago, when the company was reporting losses. For all of 1983. G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, reported record earnings of $3.73 billion, compared with $962.7 million for all of 1982. In 1980, G.M. lost $763 million, its first deficit since the early 1920's. Analysts attributed the rapid improvement in the company's fortunes to restraints on the import of Japanese cars, the ending of rebates, the strong performance of its financing subsidiary and reduced labor and materials costs.
2/7/1984	MINIVAN A HIT FOR CHRYSLER	Car dealers for the Chrysler Corporation are complaining about a shortage of the company's new minivan, but they have little hope of relief this year. The small vans, known as the Plymouth Voyager and the Dodge Caravan, were an instant success for Chrysler when the company started sending them to dealers late last year. Officially the vehicle went on sale early in January. ''I just wish I had some to sell,'' Jack Helfman, owner of River Oaks Chrysler Plymouth in Houston, said last week. ''If I had 200 on hand I wouldn't be worried. I've never seen so much activity on a vehicle.''
2/7/1984	U.S. Backing G.M. Over Chrysler Suit	The Justice Department today lent support to the efforts by the General Motors Corporation to have a Federal court here dismiss the Chrysler Corporation's lawsuit aimed at blocking a proposed joint venture by G.M. and the Toyota Corporation. In receiving permission to file a brief in the case as a friend of the court, the department said that ''the United States will take no position on the substantive merits of Chrysler's antitrust claims.''
2/6/1984	Washington Watch; A Quandary For the F.T.C.	T HE Federal Trade Commission spent 10 months last year scrutinizing an agreement for a joint manufacturing venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Company before giving its antitrust approval, and the commission remains haunted by the monumental case. In fact, the F.T.C. worries that it may be forced this week to legally cloud its December decision and perhaps wind up in court. Representative James J. Florio, chairman of the commerce subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has asked the commissioners to appear at a hearing Wednesday to defend their decision, about which he has expressed strong doubts. Among other things, he says the future of G.M.'s competitors may be threatened by the project. The Chrysler Corporation has already filed a suit challenging it.
1/28/1984	CHRYSLER'S JAPANESE BID	Lee Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation and the leading critic of the General Motors-Toyota venture, said today that Chrysler would probably make a similar deal with Mitsubishi, the Japanese auto maker that is a Chrysler affiliate. ''We will probably get together on some kind of venture some day,'' Mr. Iacocca said at a news conference. Mr. Iacocca met for several days this week with Toyoo Tate, Mitsubishi's president, and other executives in California. In a statement issued after the talks, he called the meetings ''very productive.'' He said the two sides had resolved ''several short-term issues'' and agreed to continue negotiations on building cars together.
1/26/1984	G.M.-Toyota Documents WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (AP) - The Federal Trade Commission voted today to make public 1,385 pages of previously confidential documents related to the proposed joint car-making venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation.	The panel voted, 3 to 2, to release the information, with two commissioners opposed because they said the agency was still withholding too much information. The Chrysler Corporation, a chief opponent of the joint venture, also expressed concern that some material was to remain confidential.
1/17/1984	2 UNIT TRUSTS OFFERED FOR EXXON AND G.M.	A new investment vehicle, tried previously with only limited success, is now being offered to the holders of Exxon and General Motors stock. The Americus Shareowner Service Corporation said yesterday that it has filed, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, proposals to establish two unit trusts, one for Exxon Corporation shares and one for shares of the General Motors Corporation. Each trust will have 10 million units and will allow holders to, in effect, divide Exxon and G.M. shares into conservative and speculative components. Holders will be able to exchange their common shares, on a one-for-one basis, for a trust unit of the respective company. There is a sales charge for the transaction.
1/15/1984	COMPANIES WIDEN WORKER ROLE IN DECISIONS	At the General Motors Corportion's battery plant in Fitzgerald, Ga., self- managing work teams make many decisions once reserved for management. Practices that have historically represented distinctions between blue- collar and white-collar workers have in part been eliminated, including time clocks, reserved parking and private dining rooms. This was not the way things had been done at the company, nor the way things are done at all of the company's plants today. But new management methods have become exceedingly important at General Motors. Today, numerous General Motors plants have some form of ''quality of work life'' program, and experts who have compared the plants that have the most intensive programs with other automotive plants have found the ones with the worker programs achieving lower absenteeism and labor costs, better manufacturing quality and greater customer satisfaction.
1/6/1984	DETROIT CLOSES OUT A BANNER YEAR	For United States auto makers, 1983 was a year when rebates ended and sharp cost cutting combined with solid sales to produce a financial turnaround that analysts said was little short of spectacular. The industry reported today that it continued its rebound last year from the worst sales slump since World War II, selling 6,786,977 cars for the year, an increase of 17.9 percent over the 5,756,658 sold in 1982. Including import sales of 2,368,764, a total of 9,155,741 cars were sold in the United States in 1983, making it the best sales year since 1979, when 10.5 million were sold. Sales in 1982 totaled 7,955,970.
1/2/1984	G.M. SAID TO WEIGH REVAMPING	The General Motors Corporation is considering a realignment that would consolidate its five automotive divisions into two groups, one to produce small cars and the other for larger models, according to sources in the company and the auto industry. The plan would link the Chevrolet and Pontiac divisions as the small car group, the sources said, while the Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac divisions would be responsible for larger cars. Each group would be headed by a group executive, to whom the division general managers, who are vice presidents of the corporation, would report, according to the sources. The division heads now report to a single executive, Donald H. McPherson, the group executive for G.M.'s North America Car Group.
12/29/1983	G.M.-TOYOTA: A GAIN	The Federal Trade Commission acted sensibly in approving the joint venture between General Motors and Toyota to assemble subcompact cars in an unused plant in Fremont, Calif. The commission's decision marks a departure from past antitrust policies that threatened to render American auto makers permanently uncompetitive in world markets. Observers with an eye to short- term domestic concerns are calling the venture a thinly veiled exercise in cartel building. In reality, the G.M.- Toyota venture is a rather small and normal step in the development of the international auto industry. It seems new to Americans only because of our unique and provincial concept of the industry.
12/29/1983	2 U.S. UNITS POSSIBLE FOR TOYOTA	The Toyota Motor Corporation, which won tentative approval last week for a joint auto making venture with the General Motors Corporation, could open a second assembly line here under an agreement between the two companies, spokesmen for Toyota and the Federal Trade Commission said today. Such a move would strengthen the Japanese auto maker's American foothold. Earl Kintner, Toyota's Washington attorney, said there is no plan to produce a second vehicle and called the idea a ''contingency'' in case protectionism in the United States stems the flow of cars Toyota currently exports from Japan. Under import quotas that expire next year, Toyota has been restricted to about 518,000 cars. Toyota sells most of its exported cars in the United States. ''You can readily see where there might be some pressure on Toyota to quickly gear up production,'' Mr. Kintner said.
12/28/1983	G.M. - TOYOTA STEP TOWARD MONOPOLY uf912	To the Editor: Consistency is perhaps a bugaboo of petty minds. But the strange alliance of General Motors with Toyota (editorial Dec. 21) has made me wonder about the passion with which the powers that be wanted to break up I.B.M. and failed, and spent millions to break up A.T.& T. and succeeded, both on antitrust grounds.
12/27/1983	Group Calls U.S. Blind To G.M. Autos' Defect	A consumer group asserted today that a Federal agency was refusing to continue investigating possible acceleration defects in 19 million General Motors cars. The company denied there were any problems with the cars.
12/20/1983	G.M. and Toyota Hit F.T.C. Snag	The Federal Trade Commission this evening abruptly canceled a Tuesday morning meeting at which it had been expected to approve a venture by the General Motors Corporation and Japan's Toyota Motors Corporation to jointly produce a Japanese-designed subcompact car in California, officials at the agency said. The two companies continued to bargain at the commission throughout the day in an effort to modify the plan to meet antitrust objections, but the negotiations remain snagged, according to an F.T.C. source who asked not to be identified. No new meeting date has been set.
12/20/1983	Union to Aid G.M. on Car	The United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation today announced plans to have hourly auto workers participate in the development of a new small car. The car is code-named ''Saturn,'' and is aimed at Japanese imports.
12/18/1983	THE NEW ALLURE OF MANUFACTURING	WATERLOO, Iowa WHEN Deere & Company decided in 1974 to build a new tractor assembly plant in the rolling farm country of northeast Iowa, the mandate from top management was to build one at the leading edge of manufacturing technology. That leading edge turned out to be ''flexible manufacturing,'' a technology born a decade ago that is finally beginning to transform the factory floors of some of the nation's largest companies. It's a marriage of robots and computers that might have allowed Henry Ford to turn out Model T's and Model A's almost simultaneously on the same assembly line. At Deere, the mix includes 10 different models of tractor transmissions and 5,000 configurations of tractors. ''We ended up with features in there we never even dreamed of at the start,'' said Robert W. Boeke, a senior vice president at Deere. ''We didn't realize then that you could tie the different computers in the plant together and drive the whole thing.''
12/2/1983	VENTURE BY TOYOTA AND G.M. GAINS	Staff officials at the Federal Trade Commission have effectively recommended to the full commission that a proposed $300 million auto making venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation be allowed to proceed. A commission official, who declined to be identified, said today that the agency's two principal fact-finding units and an outside consultant had reported to the commission that the benefits of the proposed venture far outweighed any anticompetitive implications. According to the official, there is a good chance that a final decision could be issued by Christmas. The five commissioners are not bound by staff recommendations, however, and have overruled them in the past.
11/24/1983	NOV. 11-20 CAR SALES DOWN 6.4%	The domestic automobile manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars fell 6.4 percent in the Nov. 11-20 period from the corresponding period a year earlier. It was the first decline since mid-May. The results, however, were skewed by a nearly 14 percent decline in sales by the General Motors Corporation, the industry's sales leader, reflecting financing incentives last November. The other five domestic auto makers - Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - reported flat to sharply higher sales.
11/17/1983	G.M. ACCORD IS SET ON CAR COMPLAINTS	The Federal Trade Commission, despite consumer protests, is permitting the General Motors Corporation to settle thousands of automobile defect complaints through an independent arbitrator, officials said today. The agreement, which calls on the Better Business Bureau to decide each case, concludes a three-year F.T.C. proceeding over complaints that General Motors failed to notify owners of engine, transmission and fuel-related problems that could involve 20 million automobiles dating to 1974 models. The commission tentatively approved the General Motors proposal last April but then was met with a barrage of criticism from consumer groups, including the Ralph Nader-sponsored Center for Auto Safety, and attorneys general in more than two dozen states.
11/15/1983	U.S. STARTS NEW INQUIRY ON BRAKES OF GENERAL MOTORS' 1980 X-CARS	The Government announced a new investigation today into the safety of power brakes on one million General Motors X-model cars. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was looking into a lack of power brake assist in the cars, 1980 models of the Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix, Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile Omega. The Federal agency said owners had complained that extra effort on the brake pedal would sometimes not stop their vehicle quickly enough and that it knew of 800 owner complaints involving more than 100 accidents and 30 injuries.
11/8/1983	G.M. RAISES DIVIDEND 40 CENTS, TO $1 A SHARE	The General Motors Corporation yesterday raised its quarterly dividend to $1 dollar a share, up from the 60 cents a share it has been paying since the second quarter of 1980. The dividend is payable on Dec. 10 to those who are stockholders of record as of Nov. 17. With the higher quarterly payment, the total 1983 dividend will be $2.80 a share, up from $2.40 a share in 1982 and also in 1981. Before the second quarter of 1980, General Motors was paying quarterly dividends of $1.15 a share.
11/4/1983	G.M.'S NEW ANSWER TO JAPAN	The General Motors Corporation today displayed the prototype of a small car intended to someday match similar Japanese cars in cost and match or exceed them in quality. G.M.'s slickly packaged glimpse of its so-called Saturn Project - a subcompact to be manufactured late in the 1980's - was evidently intended to refute charges by competitors and the United Automobile Workers union that the company was planning to stop making small cars altogether in the United States because it couldn't develop a subcompact competitive with Japanese cars. G.M. officials said they anticipate that a new manufacturing system they have designed to produce the Saturn car will cut production costs sufficiently to bring them close to those of the Japanese. One executive noted that because it costs $500 to ship a car from Japan, G.M. needs only to trim $1,500 from its current costs to match the Japanese.
11/4/1983	OCT. 21-31 AUTO SALES ROSE 25.5%	Domestic auto sales in the last 10 days of October rose 25.5 percent over a very slow period last year, the companies reported today. The six major auto companies said they sold a total of 236,895 cars in the Oct. 21-31 period versus 188,700 in the same period last year. Both periods had nine selling days. The daily selling rate of 26,322 was the best for the period since a daily pace of 27,969 cars was set in late October 1979. Last year's daily rate for the period was only 20,814 units.
11/4/1983	HOUSE 219-199, VOTES TO REQUIRE U.S. MADE PARTS IN IMPORTED CARS	In an expression of concern over extensive imports of Japanese cars, the House of Representatives approved a bill today that would require imported cars to be built with a substantial component of American parts and labor. The legislation, approved by a vote of 219 to 199, would take effect in 1987. It is aimed chiefly at Japanese manufacturers, whose exports now account for nearly 20 percent of all cars sold in the United States. If the Republican-controlled Senate approves the bill, which is considered unlikely, foreign auto makers would be forced either to increase manufacturing activity here or to reduce sales.
11/1/1983	JAPANESE CAR - EXPORT CURB KEPT	The Japanese Government announced today that it would extend restrictions on automobile exports to the United States for a fourth year, beginning next March. The number of Japanese cars shipped under the agreement will be limited to 1.85 million, up from the 1.68-million level for each of the past three years. The announcement came after morning discussions between Bill Brock, the United States trade representative, and Sosuke Uno, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry. Mr. Brock arrived here late last week. He lobbied for a small increase in the agreement, while Mr. Uno pressed for a somewhat larger increase.
10/26/1983	AUTO SALES ROSE 41.1% IN MID-OCTOBER PERIOD	The nation's six major auto manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars jumped 41.1 percent in the mid-October period from the same period last year, when sales were the lowest in more than two decades. The combined new car sales for Oct. 11 through Oct. 20 were 235,334, compared with 166,785 in the same period last year, when sales were at a 24-year low. In addition, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for mid-October was 7.6 million units, a sharp rise from the 6.7 million-unit rate in the first 10 days of the month.
10/25/1983	G.M. PROFIT UP SHARPLY IN QUARTER	The General Motors Corporation today reported that a healthy increase in auto sales, especially sales of profitable large cars, pushed third-quarter net income to $737 million, or $2.33 a share, a nearly sixfold increase from last year's quarter. General Motors was the first major automobile manufacturer to report its third-quarter results. Later this week the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are also expected to report substantial profits for the quarter. Analysts estimate that Ford earned about $250 million and Chrysler about $100 million.
10/21/1983	U.S. RELEASES DATA ON X - CAR DEFECT	The Department of Transportation today released hundreds of confidential documents from the General Motors Corporation that the agency said proved the automobile maker knowingly produced up to 1.1 million X-body cars with defective brakes in 1980. The department also charged that in the two years G.M. ''breached its statutory duty'' to report its knowledge of the problem, in which rear brakes locked, causing the cars to skid. The defect was associated with thousands of consumer complaints, 300 accidents and 14 deaths. ''If these documents had been provided to N.H.T.S.A. in 1981, as required by law,'' the Justice Department said in a brief, referring to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ''the agency would have been informed of G.M.'s own evaluation of the causes of rear brake lockup in X-cars.'' The brief was filed Aug. 3 for the highway safety agency, but it and the confidential G.M. documents were not made public until today.
10/21/1983	G.M. SETTLEMENT AND REAGAN TENETS	The negotiated settlement of a Federal job discrimination complaint against the General Motors Corporation directly contradicts a key tenet of the Reagan Administration's civil rights policy, which strongly opposes the use of numerical hiring goals. Attorney General William French Smith and the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, William Bradford Reynolds, have repeatedly denounced such goals as unconstitutional and illegal, saying they give preferential treatment to certain people on the basis of sex, race or national origin. But the G.M. agreement sets numerical goals for the hiring, promotion and training of female, black and Hispanic workers. The agreement was negotiated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a Federal agency that has independent authority to enforce Federal civil rights law as it applies to private employers. The settlement was unanimously approved by the four commission members, all appointed by President Reagan. The commission chairman, Clarence Thomas, hailed the $42.5 million agreement as a ''significant achievement.'' A novel provision calls for the automobile maker to help finance the education of female, black and Hispanic workers who seek jobs requiring knowledge of high technology.
10/19/1983	G.M. AGREES TO PAY $42 MILLION TO END CASE ON JOB BIAS	The General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest manufacturer of automobiles, agreed today to pay $42.5 million to settle a 10-year-old complaint charging employment discrimination against blacks, women and Hispanic people. It was described by Federal officials as the largest out-of-court settlement of an employment discrimination case. The agreement sets numerical goals for the hiring, training and promoting of women and members of minority groups. It also includes an unusual provision under which the company plans to give $15 million in endowments and scholarships to colleges and technical schools, primarily to assist G.M. employees and members of their families. Members of the ''affected class,'' the blacks, women and Hispanic employees, are to be given preference in the distribution of the education assistance funds.
10/14/1983	AUTO SALES SURGE 45% IN PERIOD	The nation's six major auto manufacturers opened the 1984 model year on a high note, reporting today that sales in the first 10 days of October rose 45 percent from the same period a year earlier. The producers said sales in the period were 191,695 units, up from 132,386 in the 1982 period. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the period rose to 6.7 million units, from 4.9 million units in the 1982 period and 6.4 million in the last 10 days of September.
10/11/1983	THE TOYOTA-G.M. VENTURE	Last February the Toyota Motor Corporation and the General Motors Corporation, the largest automobile producers in Japan and the United States, announced an agreement under which the two companies would jointly produce a new front-wheel- drive subcompact car at a now-closed G.M. plant in Fremont, Calif., near San Francisco. The companies would be 50-50 partners in the $300 million venture, with Toyota investing about $150 million and G.M. contributing the plant and perhaps $20 million in cash. About 200,000 cars, a version of Toyota's Corolla called the Sprint in Japan, are to be turned out annually. G.M. would buy the cars and market them through its Chevrolet dealers. The joint venture, which would operate for no more than 12 years, is to be headed by a Japanese chief executive, although the bulk of the work force would consist of Americans. Production of 1985-model cars would begin late next year.
10/6/1983	CHEVY TURNS TO THE JAPANESE	Beset by slumping sales, money-losing small cars and intense competition from Japanese imports, Chevrolet has been the most troubled of General Motors' five automobile divisions. Within a year, though, the division plans to strike back in the small-car market with what it describes as competitively priced, profitable, high-quality products. But, in a break with the past, the new cars will come from Japan or be made in this country under Japanese supervision. In preparation for the new cars, the division dropped the ''USA-1'' slogan from its ad campaign of the last few years.
10/6/1983	G.M. Will Reopen A Plant in Georgia	The General Motors Corporation announced today that it plans to reopen its idled assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., and transfer full-size car production from Oshawa, Ontario, to Wilmington, Del. G.M.'s president, F. James McDonald, said 1,625 indefinitely laid-off workers would be called back to the Lakewood plant.
10/5/1983	BIG 3'S '83 CAR SALES UP 16.7%	The Big Three auto makers ended the 1983 model year with a 16.7 percent increase in sales, the companies reported today. It was the first time since 1978 that the domestic auto makers had been able to report a year-to-year improvement in sales. The increase in sales has brought a dramatic turnabout in the financial outlook for the industry, which reported combined losses of more than $8 billion during 1979, 1980 and 1981. The increased sales, combined with new labor contracts and other cost- cutting measures have led analysts to estimate that the Big Three will report combined earnings of about $5 billion for the 1983 calendar year.
9/27/1983	Japanese Weighing Car Limit Renewal	The three-year program restricting the flow of Japanese automobiles into the United States still has six months more to run, but the campaign to extend it in some form for another year is already well under way. The Big Three auto makers in Detroit recently stated their positions on the matter. The Ford Motor Company wants the restrictions to continue at the current level of 1.68 million cars a year. The Chrysler Corporation would like the quota lowered.
9/26/1983	UNIVERSITY HELPS SAVE A FACTORY IN ALABAMA	Last fall, the betting among the 200 workers employed at the Rochester Products carburetor plant here was that they would be out of work before Christmas. The General Motors Corporation said the small factory, which has made replacement carburetors for G.M. cars for 20 years, was no longer profitable. Even after carrying out $1.5 million worth of cost-cutting measures, G.M. said it would have to trim yet another $500,000 a year from the operating budget of the Rochester Products plant to keep it open. That is when officials of G.M. and the United Automobile Workers joined community leaders in asking the University of Alabama, the community's largest employer and its dominant institution, for help.
9/24/1983	10-DAY AUTO SALES CLIMB 3.8%	Sales of new cars by the nation's three largest auto producers rose 3.8 percent in the Sept. 11-20 period, the companies reported today. A slim increase had been expected because mid-September last year was one of the few strong selling periods of 1982 and inventory shortages are now plaguing dealers. The Ford Motor Company said its sales grew 27.5 percent, while the Chrysler Corporation reported a 35.6 percent jump. But sales of the General Motors Corporation fell 8.8 percent. The three companies altogether sold 155,990 new cars in the period, up from 150,284 last year.
9/24/1983	G.M. Callback	The General Motors Corporation will call back 4,300 indefinitely laid-off workers for a second shift at its Framingham, Mass., assembly plant outside of Boston, according to a statement from F. James McDonald, G.M.'s president. The announcement followed by less than a week Mr. McDonald's Sept. 16 statement that 14,000 to 15,000 laid-off workers would be called back Dec. 1 to begin production of front-wheel-drive Cadillac De Ville, Oldsmobile 98 and Buick Electra models at Wentzville, Mo. and Lake Orion, Mich. G.M. has called back more than 65,000 laid-off workers so far this year, adding 12 shifts at United States and Canadian assembly plants, the statement said.
9/23/1983	U.A.W. WINS RECOGNITION AT COAST G.M.-TOYOTA PLANT	The United Automobile Workers union has been recognized as the bargaining agent at a plant in Fremont, Calif., where General Motors and Toyota will jointly produce small cars, the union and the companies announced today. Owen F. Bieber, the auto union president, described the agreement as a ''substantial victory'' for the union, which has so far been unsuccessful in organizing the American plants of other Japanese auto companies. The agreement was also announced in Washington by W. J. Usery Jr., a former Secretary of Labor, who represented the management in the negotiations. According to the union, the G.M- Toyota agreement recognized the union as the bargaining agent for workers at the plant once hiring begins, agreed to pay wages ''pegged to going rates in the U.S. auto industry'' and pledged to hire 2,500 of the 4,000 workers laid off when G.M. closed its Fremont plant in March 1982 because of slack demand.
9/22/1983	OPEL SALES CHIEF PICKED AS OLDSMOBILE PLANNER	John O. Grettenberger, director of sales for the General Motors Corporation's European operations, has returned to the United States to become the first director of product strategic and business planning at the Oldsmobile division in Lansing, Mich. In his new position, Mr. Grettenberger will be responsible for coordinating all Oldsmobile planning activities. With the appointment of Mr. Grettenberger, according to General Motors officials, Oldsmobile becomes the first G.M. car division to have such a planning coordinator.
9/22/1983	G.M. Plans Import Of Japanese Cars	The General Motors Corporation has informed the Reagan Administration that it plans to import thousands of Japanese cars starting in 1984 but is not lobbying to lift import restraints on Japanese autos, a company spokesman said. Clifford Merriott said that G.M.'s chairman, Roger B. Smith, visited Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and the United States trade representative, Bill Brock, in Washington on Tuesday.
9/21/1983	FORD MIGHT SUE TO BAR TOYOTA-G.M. VENTURE	A top official of the Ford Motor Company said today that Ford might join with other domestic auto companies in filing an antitrust suit to block the proposed joint venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation. Harold A. Poling, Ford's executive vice president for domestic automotive operations, said ''an antitrust suit is one alternative that would have to be considered'' if the Federal Trade Commission approves the tie between G.M., the world's largest auto company, and Toyota, the third largest. Ford is the second-largest auto company in the world. Until now, opposition to the joint venture, which is to produce Toyota-designed subcompacts at G.M.'s Fremont, Calif., assembly plant, had been led by the Chrysler Corporation.
9/19/1983	DETROIT STRESSING STYLE FOR '84	The nation's automobile manufacturers seem confident that affluent customers are returning in large numbers as the recession fades. What is more, these buyers may be ready to trade in their fuel-efficient subcompact cars for more powerful and luxurious models. So Detroit is gearing up for the 1984 model year with a new emphasis on performance and styling, rather than mileage and price. Strong sales of full-size and sporty cars have fueled the auto industry's recovery so far, and Detroit is shaping its 1984 lineup in an attempt to continue to take advantage of this trend. ''With gas prices stable right now, people don't seem to care about fuel economy as much as they did a year or two ago,'' said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''Detroit is simply following the market.''
9/17/1983	PRODUCTION SET FOR NEW G.M. MOTORS	The General Motors Corporation will begin production Dec. q of its new downsized luxury models, eventually creating 14,000 to 15,000 new jobs, F. James McDonald, G.M.'s president, said today. The company had planned to introduce the front-wheel-drive Cadillac DeVille, Oldsmobile 98 and Buick Electra models this fall, but a delay developed in May because of problems in the four-speed automatic transmission. Last week, company officials said they hoped to have the cars in showrooms in the spring. Today's announcement was the first official indication of when production would begin.
9/15/1983	Advertising; Sponsor's Role Set For G.M.	DESPITE the fact that it is the country's third-largest national advertiser, the General Motors Corporation has never sponsored a television show itself. Various divisions, such as Chevrolet, yes. But the whole company, never. That omission, however, is due to be addressed next spring, when the giant auto maker will sponsor a blockbuster of a show on CBS, a seven-hour dramatic miniseries on the life of George Washington.
9/15/1983	BIG THREE AUTO SALES CLIMB 20%	The nation's Big Three automobile manufacturers reported today that sales for the first 10 days of September were up 20 percent from very weak sales in the same period a year ago. Analysts expressed optimism for the the fourth quarter and for 1984. The three companies, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation sold 125,051 new cars, compared with 104,227 in the comparable period last year. There were eight selling days in the Sept. 1-10 period in 1983 and 1982.
9/15/1983	G.M. Sees Car Sales Rising	In his first sales forecast in almost three years, Roger B. Smith, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, predicted today that 13.5 million cars and trucks would be sold in the United States during the 1984 model year, a 15 percent improvement over the 1983 model year. Mr. Smith had halted G.M.'s long-standing custom of issuing usually highly optimistic sales forecasts after his prediction in December 1980 fell short of the mark. Since then, G.M. officials have said the market for the last few years has been too uncertain to reliably predict.
9/14/1983	MOBILE PHONE AS OPTION SET ON SOME '84 BUICKS	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would offer mobile telephones as options in some 1984-model Buick cars. The phones, which will be supplied by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, are the first to be offered by an auto maker as an option, according to the two companies. The phones will first be available on Buick Riviera coupe cars sold in the Chicago area, where a new type of mobile telephone service known as cellular radio is scheduled to start around November. The new cellular mobile telephone service, which is expected to be introduced to 30 large cities in the next two years, will tremendously expand the number of cars that can have telephones, making it economical for auto manufacturers for the first time to offer phones as an option, according to A.T.& T. officials.
9/10/1983	G.M. Denies X-Car Cover-Up	The General Motors Corporation has formally denied the Federal Government's charge that it failed to provide ''accurate and complete information'' on a reported brake problem in 1.1 million 1980 X-car models. In a brief filed Wednesday in Federal court in Washington, the automobile maker also asked for a week in which to prepare a motion to dismiss four safety-related counts in a six-count suit brought by the Government.
9/8/1983	S. & P. Lowers Chicago Rating	Chicago's credit rating was lowered yesterday by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which cited the city's ''continuing weakened financial position.'' Standard & Poor's lowered the ratings on some $625 million worth of city and Chicago Public Building Commission debt to BBBx from A-.
9/8/1983	S. & P. Lowers Chicago Rating	Chicago's credit rating was lowered yesterday by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which cited the city's ''continuing weakened financial position.'' Standard & Poor's lowered the ratings on some $625 million worth of city and Chicago Public Building Commission debt to BBBx from A-.
9/7/1983	AUTO SALES HELD BACK BY DROP IN INVENTORIES	Sales for the nation's Big Three auto makers rose a slight 13.1 percent in the Aug. 21-31 period, the companies reported today, with dealers unable to fill some orders because of drastically low inventories. From mid-June to early August, 10- day sales gains had ranged from 37.1 percent to 73 percent. But starting in mid-August, the increases in sales began to diminish as the shortage grew of cars ready for delivery. The three companies, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, sold 179,769 new cars in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last. The companies sold 158,928 cars in late August 1982.
9/6/1983	CHRYSLER AND AUTO WORKERS AGREE ON CONTRACT EXTENSION	Negotiatiors for the Chrysler Corporation and the United Automobile Workers reached tentative agreement on a new labor contract today, Owen F. Bieber, the union's president reported. Mr. Bieber said details of the pact, which will extend the current contract that was to expire Jan. 14, are being withheld until the union's 160-member Chrysler Council meets Tuesday. ''I believe the contract will be well received by the council and will, in fact, represent equity for our people,'' Mr. Bieber said. There was no immediate comment from Chrysler.
8/30/1983	AUTO MAKERS FEAR BIG FINES IF FUEL ECONOMY RULES AREN'T CHANGED	The country's two largest automobile companies are now almost certain that only relaxation of Federal fuel economy regulations can save them from heavy fines, according to officials of the companies. Both the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company have reported to the Government that they would not meet ''corporate average fuel economy'' standards this year and in the next few years, largely because sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars have slowed while those of bigger cars with thirstier engines have increased. The mileage standards increase each year until reaching 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985, meaning that the average fuel consumption of the cars each company produces and sells must not exceed that ceiling. The standards were passed by Congress in 1975 in response to the first Arab oil embargo. They were meant to force the auto companies to produce more efficient cars to lessen the country's dependence on imported fuel.
8/25/1983	BIG THREE AUTO SALES UP 19.8%	New-car sales continued to show year-to-year gains in the mid-August period, with the Big Three auto makers today reporting a 19.8 percent improvement from the same period in 1982. But the rate of recovery from depressed levels a year ago has slowed because of low dealer inventories and the elimination of incentives for buyers. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for all the major domestic auto companies, which is the broadest measure of the overall health of the industry, was 6.2 million units in the Aug. 11-20 period, compared with 7.9 million in early August and 5.1 million in mid-August of last year. The companies had been selling cars at rates of more than 7 million units since late May.
8/25/1983	DUAL-PAY PROPOSAL IS REJECTED BY UNION AT A G.M. DIVISION	Workers at the General Motors Corporation's Packard Electric Division in Warren, Ohio, have rejected a tentative contract that would have sought to preserve existing jobs by drastically cutting the wages of newly hired employees. The vote in Local 717 of the International Union of Electric Workers was 5,301 to 2,084 against the plan.
8/21/1983	RECALLED AUTO WORKERS REFLECT ON DISRUPTED LIVES AND SIDETRACKED DREAMS	The telephone call James Stoscup had been waiting to receive for almost a year came early this month. He was recalled to his job as a grinder at the General Motors Corporation's HydraMatic automatic transmission plant in nearby Ypsilanti. He was laid off last Sept. 9. His hands and arms were a little sore from the unaccustomed effort, he said. Otherwise, he was happy to be back on the job in a plant that turned out B-24 bombers in World War II and Kaiser and Fraser automobiles in the 1950's before being taken over by G.M. ''I feel real good,'' he said. ''They told us people with 1978 seniority, like I have, are back for good.''
8/21/1983	PARTS FOR BRAKES OF X-CARS FAULTED	While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking a court-ordered recall of 1.1 million General Motors 1980 X-cars because of alleged brake system defects, a spokesman for the agency said yesterday that it was not formally investigating additional charges by a consumer group that replacement brake linings worsen problems with the cars. The spokesman, Richard Burdette, said the agency had not sent letters to the manufacturers of replacement brake linings for the cars requesting information about specifications for their products. Such inquiries from the agency would constitute the first step of what could become a formal investigation.
8/16/1983	CAR SALES UP 40.1% IN 10 DAYS	The Big Three auto makers reported today that sales of new cars rose 40.1 percent in the Aug. 1-10 period, on a daily-selling-rate basis, the eighth consecutive year-to-year increase. The three companies, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, sold an average of 19,028 cars a day in the period, which had nine selling days this year and eight last year. The three sold an average of 13,585 autos daily in early August of 1982.
8/6/1983	SAFETY AGENCY ASSAILED AS LAX IN G.M. INQUIRY	A General Accounting Office study, made public today, concludes there were ''serious problems'' in the Government's handling of potential safety-related defects in General Motors 1980 X-model cars. The study by the G.A.O., an investigative arm of Congress, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not follow its own guidelines for investigations into safety-related defects and showed an ''apparent reluctance'' to inform the public. The report says the agency's investigation into the 1980 X-model cars extended from late 1979 to early 1983 and was ''allowed to remain essentially inactive for about 13 months.'' 'Campaign of Nonenforcement' Representative Timothy E. Wirth, the Colorado Democrat who had requested the study, released it in House hearings today, where he charged the safety agency with carrying out a ''campaign of nonenforcement'' under President Reagan.
8/4/1983	AUTO SALES BY BIG 3 UP 37.1%	The Big Three auto makers reported today that sales surged 37.1 percent in the last 10 days of July, continuing the recovery that has been pushing up sales sharply since April. The General Motors Corporation, the industry giant, said its 10-day sales rose 44.3 percent from last year, on a daily selling rate basis. The Chrylser Corporation, the No. 3 auto maker, said sales jumped 48.5 percent in the July 21-31 period, while at the Ford Motor Company, sales were up 17 percent. For all of July, sales by all the domestic manufacturers, including American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda, totaled 576,864, up 39.6 percent.
8/4/1983	G.M. IS SUED BY U.S. ON X-CAR DEFECTS INVOLVING BREAKS	The Justice Department sued the General Motors Corporation today, charging that the company had sold 1980 X-model cars knowing they had hazardous brake defects. The department seeks to have the manufacturer recall and repair all 1.1 million of those cars and pay the Government $4 million in civil penalties. The suit, filed in Federal District Court here, accuses General Motors of trying to cover up the extent of the problem by providing false information to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The suit further charges that company officials, under oath in some of the instances in the Government inquiry into the defects, gave answers ''they knew or should have known'' were false. A Justice Department spokesman, Brad Marman, said the department would not specify why it was not pursuing perjury charges.
