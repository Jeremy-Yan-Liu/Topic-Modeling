5/3/2012	How to Get Business to Pay Its Share	JAMES MADISON never played with an iPhone, but he might have had something to say about the news last weekend about Apple. Over the last few years, the company has avoided paying billions of dollars in state and federal taxes by routing profits through subsidiaries based in tax havens from Reno, Nev., to the Caribbean. This is a common practice among major American businesses, and back in 1787, Madison saw it coming. Someday, he warned, companies could grow so large they ''would pass beyond the authority of a single state, and would do business in other states.'' To make sure the companies remained accountable to government, he said the federal government should ''grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them, and the authority of a single state may be incompetent.''

Made with soft nappa leather accented by 18-karat gold and a silk-wrapped cord, the high-style headphones first made a splash in November, when they hit select retailers (Colette in Paris, Fivestory in New York) and gained approval from the fashion scenesters (Giovanna Battaglia, Harley Viera-Newton). Now two popular styles will be sold in Apple stores and on Apple.com. The Pleat, the collapsible over-the-ear style shown here, $400, and the Bight earbuds, $200, each available in black and white, come with a microphone and remote compatible with all Apple products.

But, of course, the Internet overlooks nothing. When asked by an analyst about Microsoft's Windows 8, a coming operating system that blends iPad-like touch-friendly features with some of the look of a traditional computer operating system, Mr. Cook said it was possible to force the convergence of any two devices. ''You can converge a toaster and refrigerator, but these things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user,'' Mr. Cook said.

Mr. Kutcher, the sitcom star of ''That '70s Show'' and ''Two and a Half Men,'' is set to portray Steve Jobs in an independent film about that Apple co-founder, Variety reported. The film, called ''Jobs,'' is to be directed by Joshua Michael Stern (''Swing Vote'') and written by Matt Whiteley, and is expected to chronicle Jobs's life from his relatively wayward youth to his involvement in the creation of Apple. Variety said the film is expected to start production in May while Mr. Kutcher is on a hiatus from ''Two and a Half Men,'' on which he plays Walden Schmidt, a wealthy Internet entrepreneur. This ''Jobs'' film is unrelated to a film adaptation of Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography ''Steve Jobs'' that Sony Pictures Entertainment is preparing.

A version of that monologue by Mr. Daisey, in which he chronicles his travels to the Foxconn factory in China where Apple products are manufactured, was retracted by the public radio show ''This American Life'' earlier this month. Journalists at that radio program said they were unable to confirm details from Mr. Daisey's monologue, and a translator who had traveled with him disputed key elements of his narrative, including supposed encounters with young teenage workers outside the plant and a meeting with a man who had been injured at the factory.

In remarks offered Thursday night before a panel discussion on the fallout from the revelations, Mr. Eustis was more critical of Mr. Daisey than he had been after the radio show ''This American Life'' first disclosed that incidents recounted in the stage production, about Apple's labor practices in China, had been invented or embellished. The radio show had run a lengthy excerpt of ''The Agony and the Ecstasy,'' only to retract it after discovering the inaccuracies.

Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public, said on Monday that he and Mr. Daisey had spoken at length about the content of the show after the weekly radio program ''This American Life'' on Friday retracted a report based on Mr. Daisey's visit to the Foxconn factory, which makes Apple products, after finding evidence that Mr. Daisey had invented damning details about life and work there. Mr. Eustis said that Mr. Daisey had decided on his own to change language, and to add a new prologue in which he acknowledged the controversy and said that he stood behind the content of the newly altered show. Mr. Eustis estimated that the changes amount to ''2 percent or less'' of the monologue.

This is the age of the iPad, and children have no shortage of things pulling at their limited playtime, which, let's hope, includes some time to build a snowman. How do the tech toys measure up? This is not a typical ''best of the year'' list; rather, it is an attempt to make you -- a busy parent or grandparent -- smarter than a fifth grader, in 1,200 words or less, while pointing out a few noteworthy examples. The prices are from Amazon.com, unless noted.

And second, your device is sending information to Apple, although in an anonymous, encrypted form. One part of Apples response is a little unconvincing, says David Pogue.

The following was added to one of the iPhone pages on Apple's Web site:We now know that the iPhone 4 antenna attenuation issue is even smaller than we originally thought. A small percentage of iPhone 4 users need a case, and we want to continue providing them a Bumper case for free. For everyone else, we are discontinuing the free case program on all iPhone 4s sold after September 30, 2010. We are also returning to our normal returns policy for all iPhone 4s sold after September 30. Users experiencing antenna issues should call AppleCare to request a free Bumper case.The quick take on this might be ''Apple to Discontinue iPhone 4 Case Program,'' but that is not quite what is happening here. The more accurate summation is ''Apple to Make You Jump Through a New Hoop to Get an iPhone 4 Case.'' Note the careful language in sentences two and three. Apple is not saying you can't have a free iPhone case anymore - it is saying that the company won't be distributing them as a matter of course. Furthermore, the iPhone app that people have been using to order their free case will no longer be available after Sept. 30. If you buy an iPhone after that date and feel that you're losing your signal, you can still call AppleCare and explain your situation. Those who are having signal dropouts can still get a free case from the company.

7/22/2010	An External Drive To Back Up a Network	Simple backup has always been an oxymoron. But I just tried a device that could change that: The Clickfree C2N drive can automatically back up Windows PCs and Macs over a home network with real set-it-and-forget-it ease. The 500-gigabyte Clickfree C2N costs $180 (it's $142 at Amazon), and that's definitely a premium over standard 2.5-inch 500-gigabyte external drives, which sell for $120 or less. But the C2N can be a truly digital-life-saving device for those who can't commit to regular backups.

Jobs, Apple's chief executive, announced news of the company's latest offering: the Apple TV. Mr. Jobs had high hopes for his latest creation, so high that he told his audience that he hoped the Apple TV would be a fourth leg to the Apple business among PCs and iPods and iPhones. When the Apple TV was unveiled a few months later in early 2007, Mr. Jobs reiterated these comments in an interview with USA Today:We've got two strong legs on our chair today - we have the Mac business, which is a $10 billion business, and music, our iPod and iTunes business, which is $10 billion. We hope the iPhone is the third leg on our chair, and maybe one day Apple TV will be the fourth leg.Yet it wasn't long before Apple downgraded its hopes of a living room accessory and fourth leg to its business, and Mr. Jobs started referring to the poor Apple TV as a ''hobby.''

7/1/2010	Reading Sheet Music, IPad Propped on the Piano	I heard a segment on NPR the other day about the George Gershwin classic ''Summertime,'' in which the cultural reporter Sara Fishko noted that the song has been performed in many different summer settings, from the Carolina coast where Gershwin wrote it in the 1930s, to the Woodstock festival in upstate New York where Janis Joplin screeched it out in 1969. But Ms. Fishko really grabbed my attention when she mentioned the somewhat remarkable fact that the song's melody consists of only six notes. (Bonus: It's written in the key of A minor, which means no sharps or flats.) As a not-so-talented pianist, this was too tempting to pass up. So in the spirit of summertime, I purchased the sheet music from Musicnotes.com and printed it on my laser printer. When downloading the sheet music, I noticed a tag that said, ''iPad compatible.''

6/17/2010	Showing iPad Photos Face to Face. How Quaint.	I bought an iPad from Apple last week - Wi-Fi-only, the cheapest model, for $499. And it's awesome. This year's ''it'' gadget has many talents, and chief among them is its ability to share photos, face to face rather than online. Just like the old days when they had those photos printed on paper. The iPad's 9.7-inch LED screen displays images in gorgeous, vibrant color in your choice of horizontal or vertical orientation. As with most things ''i,'' you add photos to the iPad by synching with your iTunes library. You can do so using iPhoto 4.0.3 (or later) or Aperture 3.0.2 (or later) on a Mac; Windows fans can use Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 (or later).

For example, if I were at a Britney Spears concert (not that I ever have been), I could create a group discussion by appending #britneyspears to my messages. Others at the event could search Twitter for this hash tag and find all concertgoers' messages tagged with it.

10/22/2006	iPod At the iWrist	There are males who see the Apple iPod as just a cool device. And then there are those more sartorially minded men who see an iPod as a thing of beauty, if not a joy forever. It is for this latter demographic that Zegna has designed the iJacket, a lightweight jacket that integrates an iPod (or perhaps the iPod integrates the jacket?) so the wearer can plug his iPod into an inner breast pocket and effortlessly direct its doings (volume, track and play/pause control buttons) from a panel near the left cuff. As a bonus, the luxury microfiber iJacket -- available in red, black or gray in either bomber or parka lengths -- protects the iPod from wear, tear and device-pilferers ($750 to $795 at Ermenegildo Zegna in New York, 212-421-4488).

9/3/2006	TO THE RESCUE	Over the years, Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple Computer, has had a somewhat contentious relationship with the news media. Most recently, Apple sued a Web site, seeking to learn the identities of anonymous sources that had leaked it confidential information about Apple products (a suit Apple lost). But last week, Mr. Jobs was asked by Reporters Without Borders, a journalism advocacy group, to intercede on behalf of two Chinese reporters who were facing a $3.8 million lawsuit by a Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer, Foxconn. The company, which assembles iPods for Apple, accused the reporters, Wang You and Weng Bao, of ''smearing its reputation'' in an article criticizing working conditions.

8/30/2006	Arts, Briefly	Linkin Park on iTunes Linkin Park, one of the few major acts that had not made its music available on Apple's iTunes Music Store, has changed course and made a deal with the service, Reuters reported. Three of the group's albums were available beginning yesterday, each with two bonus tracks and a third iTunes exclusive cut. In addition, iTunes is selling the video content featured on the group's ''Live in Texas'' and ''Collision Course'' DVD's. ''We were really excited when iTunes told us that we were one of their most requested acts,'' Mike Shinoda, a member of the group, said. ''We will never ignore our fans, and the timing seemed right to make our music available, with some special additions.'' Warning on Streisand Concert Tickets More than 1,000 tickets for the first United States concert tour of Barbra Streisand, below, in more than a decade have been invalidated because they were bought with stolen credit card information, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Organizers announced that the tickets, bought through Ticketmaster, turned up on various Internet resale sites. With tickets priced at $100 to $750, the 19-performance tour is to begin in Philadelphia on Oct. 4. (Performances in Madison Square Garden are scheduled for Oct. 9 and 11.) The national promoter, Michael Cohl, and Ms. Streisand's manager, Martin Erlichman, warned that no one holding the invalidated tickets would be admitted. Jessica Simpson's Lost Cord If timing is everything, then Jessica Simpson got nothing much yesterday. Nothing much, that is, besides a case of laryngitis. Just as she was about to begin promoting her new album, ''A Public Affair'' (Epic), she lost her voice, The Associated Press reported. ''She has been ordered to rest,'' said Rob Shuter, her press representative. ''She can talk; she can croak out a few sentences. She sounds a little off, but, you know, she can't sing.'' He said Miss Simpson, 26, became ill on Friday and has ''a strain, a bruise on her vocal cord.'' On Second Thought The rapper Foxy Brown, below, pleaded guilty and then pleaded for reconsideration when she appeared in Criminal Court in Manhattan on Monday to answer to misdemeanor assault charges, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Brown, 26, whose real name is Inga Marchand, was accused of kicking an employee of a salon and smacking a second in an argument over a payment for a manicure. When she appeared in court on Monday, she was spared jail time but, under a plea deal with the Manhattan district attorney's office, accepted three years' probation and agreed to attend anger management classes. Minutes later, she tried to return to the courtroom and withdraw her plea, contending that she had been rushed into her decision, said Edison Alban, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. He said the judge told her that ''the plea stands.'' Emmys Nip 'Pirates' The Emmy Awards might have provided joy aplenty for winners including Kiefer Sutherland and ''The Office,'' as well as the host, Conan O'Brien, but Sunday night's ceremonies were only so-so for NBC, The Associated Press reported. According to estimates from Nielsen Media Research, the show attracted its fourth-smallest audience ever, averaging 16.1 million viewers, down from 18.8 million last year, when CBS broadcast the awards in September. Nevertheless, NBC won the night's ratings race. The Emmys, seen from 8 to 11 p.m., beat strong competition in the form of ABC's broadcast of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' from 7 to 10 p.m. It averaged 10.2 million viewers. The Disney Channel has a new hit on its hands: ''The Cheetah Girls 2,'' seen on Friday from 8 to 9:55 p.m., drew an average of 7.8 million views, the most for an original movie debut in the channel's history.

On the one hand, many economists predict that the Fed will leave things unchanged, which would be welcome news for investors, but then again, who knows? The dearth of one-handed economists is legendary. (Tuesday.).

4/27/2006	In iTunes War, France Has Met the Enemy. Perhaps It Is France.	THE French take pride in their revolutions, which are usually hard to miss -- mass uprisings, heads rolling and such. So, with the scent of tear gas in the air this past month from the giant protests against a youth labor law, it was easy to overlook the French National Assembly's approval of a bill that would require Apple Computer to crack open the software codes of its iTunes music store and let the files work on players other than the iPod. While seemingly minor, the move is actually rather startling and has left many experts wondering (as ever): What has possessed the French? More is at stake than just whether French teenagers can get Chimne Badi tracks at iTunes for 0.99 euro. 
4/20/2006	The Virtues of a Second Season	Fervent computer gamers and the detectives on ''N.C.I.S.'' do it, but I had no plans to add a second monitor to my computer system -- not until I bought an upgraded video card for my PC and noted it had output connections for two monitors. Once I saw that, I could not resist dusting off my old 14-inch monitor and plugging it in along with my new 19-inch L.C.D. Recent Windows and Mac computers (and some Linux systems) can operate with multiple monitors; with my computer's Windows XP operating system, it took only a few keystrokes and mouse movements to set things up. Once I saw how it improved my productivity, I was an instant convert.
4/20/2006	Apple Reports Sharp Climb In Both Sales and Earnings	The ascent of Apple Computer continued in the most recent quarter with the company reporting a sharp increase in sales and profit. In a conference call yesterday, Apple executives offered a conservative outlook for the current quarter that fell short of Wall Street's projections. But investors seemed reassured by the strong quarterly results, showing that iPod sales were healthy in the postholiday quarter and that the sales of Macintosh computers held up.

4/13/2006	Run Windows And Mac OS Both at Once	ONLY a week ago, Apple released what seemed like an astonishing piece of software called Boot Camp. This program radically rewrote the rules of Macintosh-Windows warfare -- by letting you run Windows XP on a Macintosh at full speed. Now, some in the Cult of Macintosh were baffled by the whole thing. Who on earth, they asked, wants to pollute the magnificence of the Mac with a headache like Windows XP?
4/13/2006	For Demanding Music Lovers, An iPod Dock to Rival Apple's Own	When it comes to iPod docks, most offerings miss the bar. Some offer excellent sound and striking looks, but only Apple's own Hi-Fi system -- and now the Geneva Sound Systems Model XL -- can really fill a room with digital music. The Model XL, like the Apple Hi-Fi system, was made for audiophiles, and costs a hefty $1,075 at www.genevalab.com. It comes in three colors -- black, red and white -- and has an array of speakers rivaled only by a surround-sound system. The 600-watt system has two 1-inch tweeters, two 51/4-inch woofers and two 8-inch subwoofers. The XL includes an internal amplifier.
4/8/2006	G.M., Lucent and CBS Tackle Some Problems	FIXING lingering problems was at the top of the agenda for many big companies this week, from automakers to television networks. BURNING FURNITURE? General Motors hustled to raise much-needed cash by selling assets, notably a majority stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, for $7.4 billion immediately, with $10 billion expected by closing and a total of $14 billion over three years.
4/8/2006	Microsoft's Mac Attack	HELL froze over this week as Apple Computer unveiled Boot Camp, a free program that will allow its new Macintosh computers with Intel microprocessors to run Microsoft's Windows XP operating system as an alternative to Apple's OS X. The news media were agog and Apple's stock price zoomed at the announcement. In my view, it was mildly interesting, but hardly the revolution Apple users want to see. Many Mac enthusiasts view Boot Camp as a huge coup for Apple that will eventually take the computer hardware leadership away from Dell and the software leadership away from Microsoft. The more skeptical warn that Boot Camp shows the final mastery of the Apple platform by Microsoft. Both positions are absurd.
4/7/2006	Windows on Apple	Everyone saw it coming. First, Apple chose Intel, synonymous with Microsoft, to make chips for a new line of personal computers. Now Apple has announced Boot Camp, which will allow some versions of Windows to run more or less natively on an Apple machine. How you feel about this depends very much on whether you're a Windows or an Apple person. From one angle, Boot Camp looks like a sensible effort to expand Apple's slice of the personal computer market. So far, switching from a Windows desktop to a much sleeker iMac has meant abandoning Windows for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. That means giving up some highly specialized applications for which there is no Apple equivalent. For better or worse, Apple has never quite been able to destroy the preconception that Windows belongs to business in roughly the same way that Apple belongs to the arts. An Apple computer that can run Windows will do away with such distinctions.
4/6/2006	Scrapbooking With Video and Sound, Minus the Paper and Glue	For many scrapbookers, all that messy glue and paper is part of the fun. For others, it's just a mess. MemoryMixer, digital scrapbooking software from Lasting Impressions for Paper Inc., not only helps keep things neat and tidy, but also lets scrapbookers add video and sound to their collections of memorabilia.
4/6/2006	Yet Another Way To Pass Along the Contents Of Your Computer	What's the best way to share computer files with friends, family and associates? Many files today are too big for floppy disks, and many computers now lack drives for the disks anyway. Some files are too big to e-mail (especially to people with dial-up connections). Burning files to CD's is time-consuming, and most CD's can't be reused. And you hate to send out expensive U.S.B. flash drives. Memorex's answer is FlashDiscs, solid-state U.S.B. 1.1 flash drives that are cheap enough (three for $19.95) that you can hand out content on them the way you used to hand out floppies. Each FlashDisc holds 16 megabytes -- paltry compared with bigger flash drives, but equivalent to more than 10 floppies and big enough for the files most people share.
4/6/2006	When You Can't Take It With You, A Scan Saves the Pages for a Later Look	The interminable delays now commonplace in doctors' offices have one very minor benefit: the ability to while away the hours reading about Jessica Simpson's latest romance. Yet all too often the call to head off to the examining room seems to come just as one gets to the best part of the article. Instead of ripping out the page and ruining the magazine for everyone else, readers can scan the article with the new DocuPen RC800 from Planon.
4/6/2006	WINDOWS OR MAC? APPLE SAYS BOTH	After long imploring computer users to ''think different'' and defining the Macintosh as a lone bulwark against the Windows onslaught, Apple Computer has decided to open the gate, at least a bit. Two decades after the first Mac arrived, Apple said Wednesday that it would offer users of its latest models a simple way to run the Microsoft Windows operating system as well as its own.
4/5/2006	Yes, the New Macintosh And Windows Can Be Friends	YOU should see my new Windows XP computer. It's so cool looking. It's a compact, silent, rounded six-inch slab, only two inches tall. Its sidewalls are brushed aluminum, and the top is white acrylic -- with a big gray Apple logo in the middle. All right, you caught me. It's a Mac Mini.
4/2/2006	A Rock Career Built By Hand (And Mouse And Toolbar)	I'M not a musician, but I recently composed and recorded a song. More than that, in a Paul McCartneyesque fit of post-Beatles hubris, I played all the instruments and produced and engineered the entire thing, even though I have no experience producing and engineering anything more complicated than a Bombay martini. The title is ''Eventide,'' meant to evoke not some ye olde troubadour's serenade but the trademark I glimpsed on a fearsome-looking piece of sound reinforcement equipment backstage at a Ted Nugent concert. ''Eventide'' is four blistering minutes and 31 seconds long; it features three electric guitars, electric bass, grand piano, electric piano, two string sections, synthesizer, drums, congas, bongos, tambourine and shaker. I think it's smashing, frankly -- the old ''Avengers'' theme smudged with the dark atmospherics of Sigur Ros.
4/1/2006	An Open Mind on Open Borders	GIVE me a pint,'' gets lost in translation -- in Britain of all places -- thanks to the large numbers of immigrant bartenders and waiters, writes Andrew Leonard in the ''How the World Works'' blog for Salon. On a family trip last summer, ''Polish, Czech, Hungarian and Slovakian waitresses and bartenders abounded,'' he writes. ''But nary a pub featured authentic English-speakers.''
4/1/2006	Jitters Over Rate Increases and the Auto Business	QUESTION: Is a fast-growing economy good news or bad? Answer: Normally good, of course, but not always -- at least not if robust growth encourages the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates. That, at least, was the collective conclusion of the stock market last week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 96 points in the minutes after the Fed released its latest rate decision. Investors' moods were not helped by the prospect of a potentially damaging labor-management showdown in the auto industry. HIGHER AND HIGHER -- As expected, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent. As feared, it suggested that even more increases were coming.
3/30/2006	British Court Hears Apple v. Apple and 'Le Freak'	The High Court of Britain, accustomed to the sounds of bewigged barristers parsing the fine points of the law, was treated Wednesday to a funky playback of the disco anthem ''Le Freak'' as a lawyer for the Beatles' record company argued that Apple Computer's iTunes digital music store violated a trademark agreement between the companies. In a clash of cultural icons, the Beatles' record company, Apple Corps, wants Apple Computer to stop using its familiar logo, in the shape of an apple with a bite out of it, on the iTunes Music Store. Apple Corps contends that the use of the logo infringes on a 1991 agreement, which it says barred Apple Computer from using the logo in connection with the sale of music.
3/27/2006	For a 3rd Time, Two Apples Meet in Court	Apple Computer will meet the Beatles' Apple Corps in court this week in London, where a judge will determine whether Apple Computer's iTunes online music service violates a 1991 agreement between the two companies that, the Beatles' Apple claims, blocked the computer maker from selling music. Apple Corps, which represents the Beatles' business interests and markets their post-1968 recordings on disc, wants the computer firm to stop using the Apple trademark to sell recordings online, along with unspecified damages. Apple, the maker of Macs and iPods, said the 1991 agreement permitted using the Apple name to sell online data transfers, which are what downloaded songs amount to.
3/22/2006	Challenge to iPod Restrictions Advances in French Legislature	French lawmakers approved copyright legislation on Tuesday with a novel approach to the idea of digital freedom of choice: requiring online music vendors to make songs available for use on any digital player. The measure, which also addresses penalties for digital music pirates, was passed by a 296-to-193 vote in the 577-member National Assembly. It will now move from the lower house to the Senate for debate and a vote.
3/21/2006	The Errors Are Fatal, But Maybe There's Hope	ON two rows of plastic seats they wait, unblinking, in the hard fluorescent light. Their faces are drawn and worried. White-knuckled hands hold cellphones close and muffle frantic calls. Tears are not far off; frustration is palpable. One woman holds a tiny puppy in her arms, but no one seems to notice. Some remember the accident. Alcohol was involved. Others are baffled, still not sure what hit them. They're all staring up at a little screen at one end of the waiting room, feet tapping nervously, waiting for their number to come up. Waiting to hear, hoping against hope to hear, that everything will be O.K.
3/17/2006	France Weighs Forcing iPods to Play Other Than iTunes	In the digital music market, France is singing a different tune. A bill under debate in the French Parliament may require iPods to be able to play music purchased from competing Internet services, not just Apple Computer's own iTunes Music Store, forcing changes in the business model that gave rise to the revolution in legal digital music downloads.
3/12/2006	Much for the Few	ANDY STEWARD, a successful London computer consultant and sailboat racer, became exasperated when trying to watch his favorite sport on television. There were a few half-hour recaps of some major sailing races, but they were always shown late at night. Mr. Steward looked into creating a sailing channel on the Sky satellite service in Britain, but his idea was soon dead in the water. He would have had to pay ?85,000 (nearly $150,000) to start the channel and ?40,000 a month (nearly $70,000), as well as the production costs. That was a lot of money for an untested concept.
3/9/2006	Circuits; Almost iPod, But in the End A Samsung	ALL right, we've now entered Year 5 of the iPod Era. Apple's rivals have had plenty of time to study the iPod, figure out what makes it such a hit and offer reasonable competition. As you may have noticed, however, that hasn't happened. Of every 100 people walking by in their little music isolation bubbles, 78 of them seem to have telltale white iPod earbuds. Year after year, the iPod's market share drifts upward, leaving its rivals to fight over the scraps; call it Snow White and the 20 Dwarfs.
3/2/2006	Apple Laptop Has Looks And Brains	REMEMBER the famous five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance? If you're a fan of the Macintosh computer, meet the five stages of switching to Apple's new laptop: lust, anticipation, delight, dismay and waiting. Ordinarily, it's not really news when a computer company introduces a new laptop model. You don't see newspaper headlines blaring, ''Gateway's New P32-XC5 Adds Faster Processor, Third U.S.B. Port.''
3/1/2006	Apple Offers Hi-Fi System To Use iPod In the Home	Apple Computer furthered its push into home entertainment on Tuesday with the introduction of a high-fidelity stereo system for the iPod music player, as well as a new version of the Mac Mini computer with features for managing digital music and video. The announcements, which come as Microsoft pushes its own approach to digital home entertainment based on its Windows Media Center technology, shows Apple's increasing focus on consumer electronics.
2/27/2006	He Helped Build the iPod; Now He Has Built a Rival	When Samsung, the consumer electronics giant, decided to mount a serious challenge to Apple Computer's iPod music player early last year, it turned to a little-known Silicon Valley software start-up with a cluttered one-room office tucked away here in a building above a mortgage title company. The result of that partnership is Samsung's newest Z5 portable MP3 player, which will appear on store shelves March 5. The software inside the player was forged at Iventor Inc. by a small team of programmers led by Paul Mercer, 38, a veteran Apple Macintosh software designer.
2/24/2006	A Milestone for iTunes; a Windfall for a Downloader	It may well have been the best 99 cents Alex Ostrovsky ever spent. Early yesterday, he paid that amount to download ''Speed of Sound,'' a song on the Coldplay album ''X&Y,'' from the iTunes Music Store, the Internet music shop that Apple Computer started less than three years ago.
2/17/2006	Amazon Will Take On iPod With Its Own Music Player	Amazon.com is preparing to take on Apple Computer in digital music by introducing its own portable music player that would be linked to an online music service, according to several music industry executives involved with negotiations with Amazon. Unlike Apple, which sells songs for 99 cents each, Amazon will offer a service that charges a monthly or annual fee to customers, who will have the right to fill up their music players with as many songs as they like, the executives said. When they stop paying the fee, the music on the player will be disabled.
2/16/2006	A Jammed Video Arcade for Grown-Ups	WHEN I married and my husband asked me to convert, it was a pretty big deal. I was set in my ways. My orthodoxies were profound. But if I didn't abandon the personal computer for the Mac, he warned, the marriage wouldn't have a chance. We should not inhabit separate computing universes, he argued. I held my breath and jumped. Upon reflection, it was the best hardware decision I ever made. The Mac is easy to use, the technology refined. Most people get a watch or a piece of jewelry when they marry; I got an iBook G4 laptop and a honeymoon with five kids.
2/9/2006	A Keyboard and Mouse Set Made to Match the Mac Mini	When Steven P. Jobs introduced the Mac Mini, he expected customers to bring their own keyboard and mouse. But many keyboards -- salvaged from old family PC's -- clash with the look of Apple's austere products. The Logitech S530 addresses that issue handily. This three-quarter-inch-thick keyboard and mouse combo comes in blinding white and is cordless. Both the mouse and the keyboard connect to the computer via an unobtrusive U.S.B. receiver.
2/9/2006	Shopping On Both Sides Of the Hudson	NAVE, a boutique owned by Onward Kashiyama, the Japanese apparel company, is to open on Saturday in SoHo. Based on the idea of bringing the eclecticism of a specialty store to a single collection, Nave (below) will offer women's apparel created by a group of designers, invited to create items like sportswear, outerwear or accessories each season. The designer Richard Chai is acting as the consulting creative director of the boutique. Other design houses taking part include Barking Irons, Lincoln Mayne and Alice & Olivia of New York; Industry Rag and Ed Hardy of Los Angeles; and Rohka of Milan. Dresses, skirts, handmade knits, woven shirts, light outerwear and accessories are available from $50 to $500. At 159 Mercer Street, near West Houston Street, (212) 274-1255.
2/4/2006	Enough Enron? There's More	FOR those who follow the news only casually, highlights of the Enron trial, which started this week in Houston, may be enough. As The Houston Chronicle's trial blog observed on Wednesday, the first day of testimony, the ranks of reporters covering the trial ''are starting to thin out a bit.'' Many news organizations, the blog said, are covering the opening week and plan to return during interesting testimony, including that of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman; Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive; and Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer.
2/3/2006	The iPod Ecosystem; Add-Ons Have Become a Billion-Dollar Bonanza	In the weeks leading up to last month's Macworld conference, few people knew what the notoriously secretive Steven P. Jobs was going to announce. Gavin Downey, the director of product management at the Belkin Corporation, listened to all the rumors leading up to the everything-Apple conference in San Francisco, from the outlandish to the logical. He had to. His job is making sure there are cases, rechargers and other accessories that add features to all the variations of iPods that Apple Computer makes. Any change in direction by Apple means his company has to scramble.
1/25/2006	Intel Inside. Huh?!	THE buzzwords for the 2006 technology outlook fly thick and fast in nerd circles: high-definition DVD. ? la carte TV shows from the Internet. Windows Vista. Most of these goodies will take time to reach the masses. One, however, has already arrived, six months ahead of schedule: Apple's switch to Intel chips for its Macintosh computers.
1/20/2006	Tomorrowland: Apple Chief Set For Disney Role	Steven P. Jobs could be considered the Walt Disney of his era, breathing new life into animated movies with hits like ''The Incredibles'' and ''Toy Story,'' and reinventing Apple Computer as a media darling with its popular iPod. Now Mr. Jobs is in negotiations to join forces with the Walt Disney Company itself.
1/19/2006	Profit Rises At Apple, But Shares Tumble	Benefiting from brisk holiday sales of iPod music players, Apple Computer reported on Wednesday that its profit nearly doubled in the first quarter. But its outlook for the second quarter fell well below Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to fall as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading. Apple's report came after disappointing forecasts from Intel and Yahoo on Tuesday sent the technology sector into a sell-off that continued into Wednesday. EBay's outlook, announced late Wednesday, also fell short of expectations, and its after-hours trading suffered. [Page C6.]
1/16/2006	Michael Dell Should Eat His Words, Apple Chief Suggests	It may not be the last laugh, but on Friday afternoon, after the close of the stock market, Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple Computer, shared an e-mail chuckle with his employees at the expense of Dell, a big rival. The message was prompted by the 12 percent surge in Apple's stock price last week, which pushed the company's market capitalization to $72.13 billion, passing Dell's value of $71.97 billion.
1/15/2006	Letting Your Inner Couch Potato Go Out to Play	LIKE most other teenagers, Sydney Sheppard, 14, watches a fair amount of television when she's home. But Sydney, who lives in Porter Ranch, Calif., also watches her favorite shows while riding in the car, strolling at the mall or relaxing on the beach while on vacation in Honolulu. This highly mobile world of television-watching is possible because Sydney, an eighth grader, owns a pocket-size portable video player, and it is packed with many treasures, including episodes of ''Gilmore Girls'' and ''The O.C.'' that have been recorded from a television set. Sydney's uncle, John Messerly, a software engineer who lives in Honolulu, bought her the media player, made by Creative Zen, for about $300.
1/14/2006	The Bidding Keeps Going and Going and Going	IT was like a TV Land rerun marathon this week, with Boston Scientific topping Johnson & Johnson's bid for Guidant, the Dow eclipsing 11,000, General Motors scrambling to regain market share and Apple Computer being hailed as a blisteringly hot tech stock. There was even another sex-discrimination suit on Wall Street. Some things were new, however. China surpassed some Western industrial powerhouses with the size of its economy, and its global trade surplus set a record. FIGHT TO THE START -- It is a strange kind of bidding war when a last-minute offer from the underdog is about the same as the opening bid made by the heavily favored industry giant. But that is the case in the battle for Guidant, a maker of implantable heart devices.
1/12/2006	Pogue at MacWorld Expo	Every twelve months, Mac fans gather to meet each other to hear their prophet Steve Jobs talk about the religion known as Apple.
1/12/2006	Post-Christmas Comes a Geek's Gizmo-Rama	IF you're a nerd, geek or gadget freak, what dances in your head during the holidays isn't sugar plums. It's the prospect of the two big high-tech trade shows that kick off the new year with dazzling displays of new electronic goodies. First, a record 150,000 industry insiders and journalists descended on Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show -- and then a good number of them flew on to San Francisco for the Macworld Expo, a showcase for all things Apple.
1/8/2006	Linking a Device to a Gadget That's Wired to a Gizmo	THE average American household now owns some 25 consumer electronics products -- televisions and stereos and high-tech gimcracks of every imaginable flavor. That statistic brings that industry's annual convention in Las Vegas last week into stark relief. Some 130,000 people moved around a noisy, pulsing display space, with thousands of products covering a land mass that seemed roughly equivalent to Norway's. If a company wants its products to be among that 25, it is going to have to hustle.
1/8/2006	A MANSION TOO FAR	He may be able to revolutionize whole industries like consumer electronics and animated movies, but Steven P. Jobs is having a difficult time knocking down an old house. Mr. Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer and Pixar, lost his latest battle with preservationists over whether he can demolish a 60-year-old mansion in Woodside, Calif. Judge Marie S. Weiner of San Mateo County Superior Court ruled that a permit he received last year was invalid.
1/5/2006	Q&A	Getting a Modem To Dial on a Mac Q. We are a nonprofit organization, and we recently received a used Macintosh G3 computer with a built-in dial-up modem. Our old Windows PC dial-up connection worked fine but now the Mac can't seem to dial, and someone suggested that only a broadband connection would work. Why is that and what might be wrong? A. Macintosh computers with built-in modems work the same as Windows-based machines with modems inside. You should check the modem's software and hardware to make sure everything is functioning properly; the wrong software or a broken modem could be causing your dial-up problems.
1/1/2006	Working at the PC Isn't So Lonely Anymore	IN the beginning, personal computers were for loners. You sat at the desk and stared at the screen. To involve anyone else in what you were doing, you had to pull up an extra chair at that same desk, or carry a printout or floppy disk containing your work to a friend's or a workmate's machine. Working with computers became interesting, as opposed to merely useful, when it became a social activity. E-mail was the first big step, and the Internet the second. Now, with the BlackBerry and Skype and municipal WiFi and the omnipresent cellphone, it is tempting to think that technology has given us too many ways to stay in touch.
1/1/2006	Most-Admired C.E.O. Is Not an Oxymoron	Movie stars, supermodels and even high school students have their own popularity contests, so why not chief executives? Burson-Marsteller, the public relations firm, recently teamed up with the Economist Intelligence Unit to fill that yawning gap in human knowledge by surveying 685 ''global business influentials'' to rank the world's most-admired C.E.O.'s. At the top of the list is Bill Gates of Microsoft. Oops. He hasn't been a chief executive for more than five years, since he anointed himself ''chief software architect'' and made Steven A. Ballmer the C.E.O. in January 2000. But never mind.
12/11/2005	TV Stardom on $20 a Day	AMANDA CONGDON is a big star on really small screens -- like the 4 1/2- inch window she appears in on computer monitors every weekday morning or the 2 1/2 inches she has to work with on the new video iPod. Ms. Congdon, you see, is the anchor of a daily, three-minute, mock TV news report shot on a camcorder, edited on a laptop and posted on a blog called Rocketboom, which now reaches more than 100,000 fans a day. In terms of subject matter, Rocketboom is actually quite a standard -- one might even say traditional -- Web log: Ms. Congdon comments on intriguing items she, and the site's producer, Andrew Baron, have found on the Web, and includes links to them which appear just below clear, smooth-playing video. The items tend to be developments in Internet culture (robots and flash mobs, say, or flash mobs of robots) with a sprinkling of left-leaning political commentary (Ms. Congdon announced the posting of Representative Tom DeLay's mug shot while wearing a party hat and blowing a noisemaker) and samples of Web video from around the world.
12/7/2005	NBC to Sell TV Shows for Viewing on Apple Software	NBC Universal said yesterday that it would start to sell downloadable versions of 11 of its current and older television shows through the iTunes Music Store of Apple Computer. NBC is the second major television network to distribute programming through Apple. In October, Apple started to sell episodes from five current programs on the ABC network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company. Those programs can be watched both on Apple's latest generation of iPod portable players and on Apple and Windows-based personal computers running Apple's iTunes software.
11/29/2005	Music Players and Game Consoles Are Topping Lists	Two of the most-coveted consumer electronics items this holiday season are the Apple iPod music player and the Xbox 360 game console from Microsoft, according to retailers and industry analysts. That represents a major shift in buying intentions this year.
11/21/2005	TiVo to Transfer Shows to iPods, Sony PSP	TiVo, the maker of digital video recorders, plans to announce a new feature on Monday that will let TiVo owners watch recorded television shows on Apple's video iPods and on Sony's handheld PSP game machine. The announcement builds on TiVo's release in February of an update to its video recorders that allows its users to transfer programs to personal computers and DVD's, as well as to portable video players that support Microsoft's mobile video format. When the company releases new software in the first quarter of next year, it will extend that capability to the video iPod, released last month, and the Sony PSP.
11/10/2005	The Small Screen, Redefined	When Apple Computer introduced an iPod last month able to play video, it emphasized that it was not a ''video iPod,'' but simply an evolved iPod that had added a trick. That may have been a way of hedging its bets. Until now, sales of portable devices that play video have been disappointing, only ''in the thousands of units per month,'' said Ross Rubin, director of industry analysis for the NPD Group, a research firm.
11/8/2005	First for Free, Then for Pay At 2 Networks	In separate moves, the CBS and NBC Universal television networks said yesterday that they would start selling reruns of their top new shows within hours of their broadcast for 99 cents an episode through video-on-demand services on cable and satellite. The move follows ABC's recent deal to make several of its shows available for paid downloads on Apple's latest iPod portable music and video player. This is the first time the CBS and NBC broadcast networks have tried to be paid directly for newly broadcast shows rather than just rely on advertising revenue.
10/25/2005	Is Imitation Flattery, Theft or Just Coincidence?	A DISPUTE over the uniqueness of a popular new commercial for the Apple iPod is again raising the issue of what constitutes originality in advertising. The commercial, featuring the rap artist Eminem, is the most recent in a two-year-old campaign from Apple Computer that uses silhouettes of singers and iPod users to promote the iPod digital jukebox and the iTunes service. From Times Square to Turkey, the Apple commercial has been sending eyebrows skyward among writers and readers of Web logs devoted to advertising.
10/23/2005	Across the Bay, an Outpost of Cool	It was tremendously busy at the Staten Island Mall last weekend, but not for the usual reasons. No one flipped through the 2006 Orlando Bloom calendars at Day by Day Calendar Company, nor was there interest in the colorful bulk sweets at Candylicious. No lines materialized for the hydro-massage ''Spa Capsule'' chamber, even at the reasonable rate of $10 for seven minutes. Instead, mallgoers cheerfully elbowed their way into a new store with big glass windows and only a shining white silhouette of an apple to serve as its name. For its second retail location in New York after its two-story bazaar in SoHo, Apple Computer had chosen Staten Island. And although the island might seem an unlikely choice for a new Apple store ahead of supposedly hipper city districts, the decision seemed a smart one, at least judging by the crowds on its opening day, Oct. 15.
10/20/2005	An IPod Worth Keeping An Eye On	CALL it the iPod Paradox: with each successive version, Apple's 30-million-selling music player gets thinner and thinner, but its feature list grows longer and longer. By next year, no doubt, the iPod will act as a radio, remote control and coffee stirrer, but will be thin enough to roll up into a tube. The latest model, unveiled last week, is deliciously thin (4.2 by 2.4 by about 0.5 inches). In addition to its usual repertory (presenting music, digital photos, calendar, address book and song lyrics), it can now play video.
10/17/2005	Now Playing On a Tiny Screen; Is That a One-Minute Soap Opera, Or Is It Mom Calling?	When Eric Young directed his first episodes for the cellphone serial drama ''24: Conspiracy,'' it was the bullet holes that vexed him most. Mr. Young, hired to create 24 one-minute mobile episodes for a spinoff of the hit series ''24,'' learned that making video for a pocket-size screen is far different from making it for a 27-inch television set. About 70 percent of the images he used were close-ups of actors, because panoramic shots appeared blurry. He said he used tiny speakers to hear what ''the sound of a neck cracking'' would be like on a cellphone after one of the episode's characters died from a snapped vertebra. But for gunshot wounds, the director was forced to make the bullet holes extra large and to double the amount of blood so they could be easily identified on the small screen.
10/14/2005	Samsung to Pay Large Fine In Price-Fixing Conspiracy	The Samsung Electronics Company, the world's largest maker of computer memory chips, agreed Thursday to plead guilty and pay a $300 million fine for participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices, federal prosecutors said. It is the second-largest criminal antitrust fine ever levied. The Justice Department has spent more than three years investigating Samsung of Korea, along with its competitors Hynix Semiconductor of Korea and Infineon Technologies of Germany, on charges of conspiring to fix prices of dynamic random access memory chips from April 1999 to June 2002. Both Hynix and Infineon have already pleaded guilty for their roles in the scheme.
10/13/2005	With New IPod, Apple Aims to Be a Video Star	Having conquered the world of portable digital music, Steven P. Jobs set his sights on television Wednesday, unveiling an Apple iPod that can play video -- along with an online shop to fill it with TV shows, short films and music videos at $1.99 apiece. Mr. Jobs is undertaking his effort to transform the world of video with only two major producers -- the Walt Disney Company and his own Pixar movie studio, which have been uneasy partners in film distribution -- and without the broad support he lined up from the music business for selling songs online.
10/12/2005	Apple's Profit Quadruples, Yet Stock Falls	Apple Computer reported Tuesday that its earnings quadrupled in its fourth quarter on strong demand for both iPods and Macs. But overall sales of iPods fell short of analysts' high expectations, causing Apple shares to plunge in after-hours trading. Apple's report came a day before a product announcement that has the industry speculating about the company's next direction. Much of the speculation has focused on the possibility of an iPod that can play video, accompanied by music video sales through Apple's iTunes service.
10/10/2005	Japan's Music Industry Wants Fee On Sales of Latest Digital Players	In the United States, recording labels want a bigger slice of Apple's success in digital music by seeking higher prices on downloaded songs. Japan's music industry has a different idea: putting a fee on iPods. The industry has asked the Japanese government to charge a royalty, to be added to the retail price of portable digital music players like Apple's iPod, which has been explosively popular here. Money earned from the fee, which will be probably be 2 to 5 percent of the retail price, would go to recording companies, songwriters and artists as compensation for revenue lost from home copying.
10/2/2005	What Do TiVo and the Mac Mini Have in Common?	TODAY'S theme is elegant underdogs: the devices or solutions that don't lead their markets but are in many ways more admirable than the ones that do. For years the Apple Macintosh has defined this category. Indeed, the Mac's business history illustrates important changes in the role of the tech also-ran. From the mid-1980's through the late 1990's -- a period that started with the widening use of Windows and ran through the widening use of the Internet -- the pressures toward standardization created not just market leaders but also all-dominating market leviathans. Consider word-processing software: through the 80's and early 90's, there were a dozen contenders. Now, for practical purposes, there is only Microsoft Word.
9/29/2005	Circuits; Bargains in a Flash	Apple Computer got a bargain on the memory chips that make its new iPod Nano music players so slim. And in doing so, Apple has thrown the market for flash memory into a tizzy: forcing prices up for other manufacturers and driving prices down for consumers. Flash memory (or more precisely, NAND flash memory chips) stores data on a semiconductor. Most consumers use it in the form of U.S.B. flash drives to ferry data from one PC to another, or as memory cards that record hundreds of photos in digital cameras. Apple uses flash memory as a substitute for a hard disk drive so it can make its music player only a quarter-inch thick. (NAND is an industry term that refers to a form of logic gate programmed on the semiconductor.)
9/15/2005	Sony Says It's an IPod Killer, Not Just Another Walkman	Can the Walkman, the product that began the portable music revolution 26 years ago, make a comeback against the explosively popular iPod? The Walkman's maker, Sony, is betting that it can. But before it challenges Apple's global dominance, Sony must first prove it can beat its American rival in a market much closer to home: Japan.
9/15/2005	Defying Odds, One Sleek IPod At a Time	APPLE says its iPod music player and iTunes music store have 74 and 85 percent of their worldwide markets. But according to Gene Munster, a Piper Jaffray analyst, the end is near. ''Nobody can sustain an 80 percent market share in a consumer electronics business for more than two or three years,'' Mr. Munster told CNN. ''It's pretty much impossible.'' Well, he's right about one thing: Apple's market share won't stay at 80 percent. It's about to go up.
9/12/2005	Sun Microsystems Returns to Its Roots to Determine a New Direction	Scott G. McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, likes to describe his ''iPod moments'' -- businesses that could potentially snowball like something thought up by his counterpart at Apple Computer, Steven P. Jobs. Mr. McNealy, whose computer company is still looking for ways to grow again after the dot-com collapse of 2000, desperately needs at least one such moment. Now he may have found it in the work of a Sun co-founder, Andreas Bechtolsheim, who on Monday will deliver the first in a new line of computers that he returned to the company to design.
9/12/2005	Objects in Ears Are Not as Full as They May Appear	Last week, after Apple Computer unveiled the Motorola Rokr, a cellphone with Apple music software, there was immediate criticism in online discussion groups of the device's miserly 100-song limit. But a survey released last week suggests that people greatly overestimate how much capacity they need on their digital music players.
9/12/2005	Want 'Satisfaction'? You Won't Get It From This Best Songs List	When Rolling Stone magazine published a special issue in 2004 titled ''The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,'' some detractors noted that the list was heavily weighted toward old favorites. For example, there are 202 songs on it from the 1960's and only 21 songs from the 1990's. The No. 1 song was Bob Dylan's ''Like a Rolling Stone,'' followed by ''Satisfaction'' by the Rolling Stones and ''Imagine'' by John Lennon. In a shot across Rolling Stone's bow, Blender magazine, which is owned by Dennis Publishing and has a circulation of 630,000, is coming out with its own list, ''The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born,'' comprising only songs published after 1980. Their No. 1 song is Michael Jackson's ''Billie Jean,'' followed by ''B.O.B'' by OutKast and ''Sweet Child o' Mine'' by Guns N' Roses.
9/8/2005	IPod Phone Isn't Perfect, But It's a Start	''IPOD phone.'' It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? You'd better believe it. When Apple announced that it was about to unveil something big, its stock price zoomed to a record high. The Gizmodo Web site posted an exhibit of no fewer than 24 different faked ''iPod phone'' photos that have circulated online. Gadget freaks worldwide went foamy at the mouth.
9/8/2005	Apple Unveils A New Ipod And a Phone Music Player	Apple moved on Wednesday to extend its dominance over the digital music marketplace, introducing a compact iPod called the nano and confirming a widely reported digital music partnership with Motorola and Cingular. With his usual showmanship, Apple's chairman, Steven P. Jobs, saved the introduction of the new solid-state version of the iPod for last, slipping it from the change pocket of his blue jeans at the end of a press event at the Moscone Convention Center here.
9/8/2005	Q & A	Opening Windows On a Macintosh Q .I have a Macintosh and want to run .exe files on it, but it will not open them. Is there a Mac program that will let me play the files? A. The extension .exe stands for executable file, and it is typically the file type used by programs written to run on Windows and DOS systems. When a computer runs a program for you, it is ''executing the file.'' This can be a good thing for programs you want to use, but if you see .exe files you weren't expecting attached to e-mail messages, be wary, as computer viruses can also be executable files. Software programs written specifically for Windows hardware usually won't run on current Macintosh machines without special software. Programs like Virtual PC, however, let you mimic a Windows system on your Mac. You can run most software written for Windows and use some networking functions and hardware devices designed for the PC.
9/8/2005	The Arts, Briefly; Downloading Harry Potter	Harry Potter has conquered another medium. Apple Computer and the Random House Audio Publishing Group said yesterday that the entire series of Harry Potter audiobooks, read by Jim Dale, are now available as a digital download at Apple's iTunes site. The six audiobooks, previously available only on CD or tape, can be purchased individually for $32.95 to $49.95 each, or the entire 95-hour digital box set is available for $295. Apple said that the collection also includes a full-color digital booklet and ''previously unreleased readings from author J.K. Rowling.'' Random House has sold more than 5 million copies of audiobooks in the Harry Potter series. EDWARD WYATT
9/3/2005	Is Dell a Buy For Consumers Or Investors?	DELL, the world's largest maker of personal computers, earned its dominance by cultivating one of the most highly recognized and admired technology brands, while also being the industry's lowest-cost major manufacturer. Lately, though, the market has changed to suit the business models of competitors like Hewlett-Packard and Apple, and it shows in the performance of the three companies' stocks. Since the start of the year, Dell has fallen 17 percent and its rivals are up more than 30 percent.
9/1/2005	Apple Is Accused of Violating Software Patent	Creative Technology, a maker of portable music players, has accused Apple Computer of violating a newly granted software patent covering the way users navigate music selections. Creative Technology, which is based in Singapore and has United States operations in Milpitas, Calif., said it would consider every option available to defend the patent, including possible legal action. Apple declined to comment on the patent.
8/30/2005	An IPod Cellphone Said to Be Imminent	Apple Computer and Motorola plan to unveil a long-awaited mobile phone and music player next week that will incorporate Apple's iTunes software, a telecommunications industry analyst who has been briefed on the announcement said on Monday. The development marks a melding of two of the digital era's most popular devices, the cellphone and the iPod, which has become largely synonymous with the concept of downloading songs from the Internet or transferring them from compact discs.
8/27/2005	Apple, Digital Music's Angel, Earns Record Industry's Scorn	Two and a half years after the music business lined up behind the chief executive of Apple, Steven P. Jobs, and hailed him and his iTunes music service for breathing life into music sales, the industry's allegiance to Mr. Jobs has eroded sharply. Mr. Jobs is now girding for a showdown with at least two of the four major record companies over the price of songs on the iTunes service.
8/22/2005	Where to Spend $4 Billion? Google Has Plenty of Projects in Mind	In all the speculation that followed the announcement from Google on Thursday that it planned to raise an additional $4 billion by selling stock, no one seemed to recall the space elevator. The elevator -- a fanciful alternative to rocket boosters to reach earth orbit -- is one of the dozens of business ideas that have been considered by the company's wide-eyed founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. It also is one of the ideas that the company's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, has taken pride in keeping ''below the line.''
8/18/2005	The Free Toaster? Today, It's an IPod	When Nahs Horton, a 26-year-old entrepreneur, recently decided to join Lakeshore Athletic Club, a fitness center here, he cited two reasons, one big and one tiny, for doing so: the chance to play pickup games with National Basketball Association players who sometimes work out there, and the free iPod Shuffle that the club offered for signing up as a new member. ''To play against N.B.A. players -- that's the biggest reason I joined,'' Mr. Horton said. ''But they were like, 'Hey, if you join you get an iPod Shuffle,' and I was like, 'Cool, that's an added bonus.'''
8/15/2005	An IPod for Your Thoughts: A Web Site Offers Incentives to Reviewers	THE idea is so tantalizing, it is no wonder that online businesses keep trying to crack the nut: create a Web site for users to post valuable information, the thinking goes, and people will flock to it, with advertisers in hot pursuit. Countless dot-coms that harnessed themselves to that concept during the Internet boom went off a cliff in the Internet bust. But Judy's Book, a Seattle start-up that invites people to evaluate restaurants and other businesses in the towns where they live, finds it worth trying again. And it has hit on a gimmick that it says it believes will motivate people to undertake the otherwise uninspiring job of rating the Main Street diner or the garage across from the train station: free iPods.
8/11/2005	Q & A	To Buy a Mac Now Or Wait Awhile Q. I want to buy a new iMac now, but was wondering if I should wait until the new Intel-based versions appear. Is there any reason to wait? A. Apple Computer's recent announcement that it was changing the processors inside its Macintosh computers means some big changes when the company switches to Intel-based chips from the current PowerPC processors made by I.B.M. and Motorola. Apple plans to release some Macs with Intel processors starting in 2006, and hopes to have most new Macs running the chips by 2007. Such a change typically means that programs and software written to run on one type of processor must be rewritten or modified to work on a different processor. Some companies may create a version of a program that runs on both PowerPC and Intel chips, while others may sell the versions separately.
8/7/2005	Britney to Rent, Lease or Buy	THE Internet has been described, by enthusiasts, as a global conversation, a giant encyclopedia or a 24-hour news service -- and by detractors as the world's most technologically advanced time waster. What peeves record-company executives, however, is how many people see it as a free music store. A Supreme Court decision at the end of June, however, may eventually put an ''Out of Business'' sign on that store. In MGM Studios v. Grokster, the court found that the makers of software like Grokster, which lets Internet users freely browse and copy songs from one another, can be sued for their role in encouraging copyright infringement. The record companies' lawyers now have a green light to try to shut down the file-swapping services.
8/3/2005	When Computer Store Meets Historic District	Plunked amid a phalanx of ornate buildings on Fifth Avenue -- structures with classic Greek columns, cast-iron arches, filigreed cresting and intricate friezes -- is a two-story stub of a building that has preservationists gnashing their teeth at the Apple Computer Company. The preservationists do not particularly want the decidedly unremarkable, 3,550-square-foot building at 136 Fifth Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, to be preserved. They are not demanding that its proposed replacement mirror the florid style of its environs.
8/3/2005	Apple Offers a Mouse to Counteract the One-Button Blues	For decades one of Silicon Valley's favorite Zen questions has been, ''How many buttons should a computer mouse have?'' Apple Computer's co-founder and chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, once said that one was the obvious answer because that made it impossible to push the wrong button.
7/28/2005	Q & A	Solving the Mystery Of a Mac's Sounds Q. I hear the sound of a creaking or slamming door on my Mac OS X computer. Does that mean something or someone has just entered and left my computer? What is happening? A. The Macintosh operating system can play all sorts of system alert sounds, from warning beeps to audio cues that new messages have arrived in your e-mail in-box.
7/28/2005	In One Stroke, Podcasting Hits Mainstream	EVER since Steven P. Jobs returned to Apple Computer in 1997 after a 12-year absence, his company has thrived by executing the same essential formula over and over: Find an exciting new technology whose complexity and cost keep it out of the average person's life. Streamline it, mainstream it, strip away the geeky options. Take the credit. So far, Apple has worked this kind of magic on digital video editing, wireless networking, online music selling, R.S.S. feeds (a kind of Web site subscription) and other technologies. Its latest attempt, however, will be music to an awful lot of ears. With its release of the free iTunes 4.9 software for Mac and Windows, Apple has just mainstreamed podcasting.
7/21/2005	Q & A	Safe and Serene Behind a Firewall Q. How does a firewall program know if someone or some program is trying to deliberately break into a computer? A. Firewalls -- named after the flame-blocking structures designed to keep fires from spreading -- are programmed to analyze the network traffic flowing between your computer and the Internet. The firewall compares the information it monitors with a set of rules in its database. If it sees something not allowed, say, another computer trying to connect to one of the machines on your network, the firewall can block and prevent the action.
7/21/2005	Circuits; Secrets to Good Hard-Drive Hygiene	My cousin Steven Cristol should enter the lottery: he's already beaten seemingly impossible odds by enduring ''seven mechanical hard drive failures in five computers,'' as he describes it. One drive failure is unsurprising, but usually after several years of use. Two failures are improbable. Seven puts us into an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.''
7/15/2005	Upbeat Reports Send S.&P. To Highest Close in 4 Years	The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed yesterday at its highest level in four years, after good earnings news from Apple Computer, lower-than-expected inflation in June and stronger-than-expected retail sales. An additional lift came from a sharp drop in the price of crude oil, which fell 3.7 percent to a price below $58 a barrel.
7/14/2005	E.R. for Hard Drives	He knew it was important, but backing up his hard drive was the last thing on Ryan Risdal's mind. Mr. Risdal, 35, was too busy rearing four children and caring for his ill wife. One day after her death last August, Mr. Risdal was trying to recover some pictures from his computer to display at his wife's funeral. But the computer would not cooperate, and the local repair shop told him he was out of luck. The drive was inoperable, and nothing could be retrieved.
7/14/2005	IPod Sales Give Apple 75% Jump In Revenue	Showing continued strong growth of its popular iPod digital music player and impressive personal computer sales in the United States, Apple Computer reported quarterly earnings on Wednesday that far outpaced the expectations of financial analysts. Apple said net income for its third quarter, ended June 30, rose to $320 million, or 37 cents a share, from $61 million a year ago, or 8 cents a share, adjusted for a stock split. The results surpassed the consensus forecast of analysts, which was 31 cents a share. Moreover, revenue increased 75 percent to $3.5 billion, from $2.01 billion during the quarter in 2004.
7/6/2005	Apple Executive Calls Family Of Teenager Killed for IPod	As Errol Rose made preparations on Monday to bury his 15-year-old son, Christopher, who was killed last week in Brooklyn during a fight over an iPod, he received a telephone call from a stranger. The man spoke in tones that the grieving father said had momentarily quieted his anguish. The stranger, Mr. Rose soon learned, was Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer, the company that makes the iPod.
6/29/2005	Apple Offers New Access To Podcasts	Apple Computer added new utility on Tuesday to the device that gave podcasts their name. It made available a version of its iTunes software designed for subscribing to podcasts, audio recordings that can be downloaded to an iPod or other music player for portable listening. The company also announced that it was merging its iPod and iPod Photo product lines, creating a single line of MP3 players that all feature color displays with the ability to view album artwork, photos and slide shows as well as play music.
6/23/2005	You've Got Mail, Where You Want It	Q. Do I have to use America Online's software to download my AOL mail, or can I use the same e-mail program I use for my other mail accounts? A. Although America Online once required that you use its own software to send and receive mail from your AOL account, you can now use a standard e-mail program like Outlook or Eudora to manage your AOL mail. The e-mail program you use needs to support the IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) system for handling e-mail, which is different from the POP (Post Office Protocol) used by many mail programs. Some mail programs like Apple Mail can handle both IMAP and POP.
6/16/2005	Max Headroom No More	When Kevin Callahan started offering classical guitar lessons over an Internet video link, he wanted the sound to be as close as possible to being in the same room. After experimenting, he built a system that channeled three guitars, a microphone, and an orchestral synthesizer through a professional mixing board to his Macintosh. From there, he blended the sound with Apple's GarageBand software before sending it out over the Internet. ''It's not necessary,'' he explained a bit nonchalantly, ''but it gives me quite a bit of flexibility.''
6/11/2005	Think Similar	Nearly a quarter-century ago, Apple Computer ran a snarky ad after its onetime rival encroached on its territory: ''Welcome, I.B.M. Seriously.'' This week, however, Steven P. Jobs had a different message for Big Blue, which had since become a chief ally: ''Goodbye. Seriously.'' Mr. Jobs, 50, a co-founder of Apple, is famously brash and mercurial. Even so, the Apple faithful -- not to mention I.B.M. itself -- were caught by surprise by Apple's decision to end its 14-year relationship with I.B.M. and team with Intel for its computer chip needs.
6/7/2005	Apple's Next Test: Get Developers to Write Programs for Intel Chips	Steven P. Jobs took the stage at Apple Computer's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday to tell more than 3,000 of his most enthusiastic fans -- and occasionally also his harshest critics -- that he was giving them a new homework assignment: to rework their Macintosh programs to run on chips from Intel. Apple's decision to shift the Macintosh microprocessor business to Intel, a longtime rival, after more than a decade with I.B.M. was the latest bold maneuver in his eight years back at the Apple helm, a period in which he has reinvigorated the Macintosh line and overseen Apple's ascendancy in the digital music business.
6/6/2005	Apple Plans to Switch From I.B.M. to Intel for Chips	Steven P. Jobs is preparing to take an unprecedented gamble by abandoning Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chips developed by I.B.M. and Motorola in favor of Intel processors for his Macintosh computers, industry executives informed of the decision said Sunday. The move is a chesslike gambit in a broader industry turf war that pits the traditional personal computer industry against an emerging world of consumer electronics focused on the digital home.
6/4/2005	Apple Shares Slide on Reports Of a Slowdown in IPod Sales	Shares of Apple Computer dropped almost 5 percent on Friday on speculation that the company might be experiencing a slowdown in sales of iPods, the product that has largely driven its phenomenal growth the last few years. The concern came after an independent Web site, AppleInsider.com, reported that shipments of iPods, the portable digital music players, appeared to be ''flat or declining'' this month, and that the product was ''overstocked.''
6/2/2005	Q & A	A Software Key To Lock Up Data Q. I keep a spreadsheet file on my laptop with the passwords to all my online accounts and the Social Security numbers of my family members. I have it password-protected, but I would like a more secure file-encryption program. I tried PGP Desktop, but it seemed capable of doing much more than I needed. Is there a simpler program? A. PGP, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy, is a powerful encryption program used to protect sensitive data. The most recent commercial version of the PGP Desktop program can automatically encrypt e-mail, instant messages, archived files and more. There is a $99 version of PGP Desktop for home users with newer Windows and Macintosh operating systems (www.pgp.com) and an older version that works with many operating systems, free for noncommercial use, at www.pgpi.org.
5/12/2005	Q & A	A Bluetooth Path To the Printer Q. Is it possible to print wirelessly over a Bluetooth connection? A. Bluetooth, the wireless technology named after a 10th-century Viking king who united Denmark and Norway, can indeed be used for printing -- if you have the right equipment on both sides of the connection. Although it was sometimes confused with Wi-Fi wireless networking when first introduced, Bluetooth is intended to replace the cables used for short-range connections, like those from a computer to a printer or from a personal organizer to a laptop.
5/5/2005	Warp Smart Objects to the Vanishing Point With the New Photoshop	WHOEVER said ''the camera never lies'' was either a prankster, a simpleton or somebody who had never heard of Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop, of course, is the world's most popular photo-editing software (for Mac and Windows). Every time a magazine pastes a movie star's head onto a different body for its cover, you can bet that Photoshop was involved. Such digital manipulation is so common that ''Photoshop'' has become a verb: ''My ex-husband was on that trip, too, but I've Photoshopped him out of this shot.''
5/5/2005	CIRCUITS: Q & A	Programs That Start When XP Does Q. My Windows XP machine takes forever to start up. How can I tell what programs are loading during the start-up process? A. One way to sneak a peek at what programs start up when you turn on your computer is to use the System Configuration Utility that comes with Windows XP. To get to it, go to the Start menu and select Run. In the Run box, type ''msconfig'' (without the quotation marks) to start the utility. Click the Startup tab in the System Configuration box to see the list of programs that open when Windows starts up, along with check boxes to turn each program off or on during the next start-up.
5/2/2005	MediaTalk; An IPod Crime Wave? How Terrible. On Second Thought...	Read one way, a report last week by the New York Police Department seemed a public relations disaster for Apple Computer. Thefts of iPods were held accountable for an increase in subway crime, and the story traveled far and wide. The Daily Telegraph of Sydney, Australia, published an item under the headline ''iPod Crime Wave Sweeps N.Y.'' But finding different ways to read bad news is the lifeblood of public relations executives, some of whom said that the company could make a windfall of its misfortune. After all, if iPods are targets of theft, isn't the implicit message that iPods are objects of desire?
4/30/2005	Steve Jobs's Review of His Biography: Ban It	No one can accuse Steve Jobs of indifference. In an image-obsessed fit of pique, Apple Computer has banished books published by John Wiley & Sons from the shelves of Apple's 105 retail stores -- all because of Wiley's plans to publish an unauthorized biography of Mr. Jobs, Apple's chief executive.
4/29/2005	The Strange Pleasure of Upgrading Software	Like many Apple computer users, I'm in a pleasant state of expectation. I've ordered Apple's updated operating system, but it hasn't yet arrived. I have housecleaning to do before I can install it: deleting dead programs in my applications folder, for instance, and backing up my hard drive. Then will come the almost visceral pleasure of installing new software. This is one of the most pleasant tasks I know, vastly easier than straightening up the barn or taking the truck in for service. Somewhere at home I have the floppy disks of many previous upgrades, including versions of MS-DOS -- the first Microsoft operating system -- that date from the early 1980's. They are reminders of how strange the idea of software seemed to me at the time. It did not occur to me then that such strangeness was part of living in a hardware world.
4/28/2005	Apple's Tiger May Even Have PC Owners Longing for a Mac to Put It In	IF anyone considers tomorrow a special day at all, it's probably because it's Friday, or because ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' movie opens, or because it's Uma Thurman's birthday. But for one particular group of 25 million computer owners, April 29 is a much bigger deal. It's the day Apple releases Mac OS X 10.4, nicknamed Tiger -- the latest version of the software suite that makes up the Macintosh operating system.
4/28/2005	Apple Supported in Online Publishing Dispute	Apple Computer yesterday gained the support of the Intel Corporation and Genentech in its effort to make online publishers disclose their sources of confidential information about new Apple products. Intel and Genentech filed papers in state court in San Jose, Calif., supporting a ruling permitting Apple to subpoena two online news sites and an e-mail service provider. Apple is seeking to learn who gave the Web sites proprietary information about its GarageBand software, used to record and mix music.
4/21/2005	Loudspeaker Sound From a Docked IPod, for Those Who Can Bear to Listen	IPod docking stations with loudspeakers, aimed at living rooms, are popular new audio products. The problem is that most of these systems are capable of only average audio fidelity. Not so with the iFi system from Klipsch. Along with two magnetically shielded wall-mountable speakers built with titanium domes, the $400 silver docking station, available at www.klipsch.com as well as from audio retailers and online stores, has a separate 8-inch 200-watt subwoofer outfitted with a lightweight ceramic cone.
4/14/2005	Vaults That Let You Store (and Show) Your Photos, and Keep Shooting	WHEN you really stop to think about it, memory cards are a pretty delicate storage format for something as important as your digital photos. So many things can happen to memory cards: they can get lost, stolen, corrupted or, in the case of those little tiny xD-Picture cards, blown into the next ZIP code when you sneeze. The point, of course, is that memory cards are designed for temporary storage inside the camera. Once the card is full, your photos desperately want to be transferred to some larger, safer, more permanent home.
4/14/2005	Apple Beats Outlook on IPod and Mac Sales	Continuing a trend that has run for several quarters, Apple Computer on Wednesday reported a profit for the second quarter that beat even its expectations based on continued brisk sales of its iPod portable music player, as well as improving sales of Macintosh computers. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., posted revenue growth of 70 percent in the second quarter, from $1.91 billion to $3.24 billion. Profit in the quarter was $290 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with $46 million, or 6 cents in the period a year ago.
4/13/2005	Apple to Start Selling New Macintosh Operating System	Apple Computer said on Tuesday that it would begin selling the fifth version of its Macintosh OS X operating system later this month. The program, which is named Macintosh OS X 10.4 Tiger and will sell for $129, has a variety of new features and some new internal technologies, as well as improved compatibility with Microsoft's Windows.
4/11/2005	In Britain, Apple's iTunes Fans Have Reason to Be Confused	People who want to use Apple's popular iTunes service in Britain must go to the Web page www.itunes.com/uk, not www.itunes.co.uk. The minor difference may make very little difference to music lovers, but to Apple Computer and Benjamin Cohen, a 22-year-old British entrepreneur, it is a difference worth fighting over in court.
4/7/2005	CIRCUITS: Q & A	Maximizing the Life Of a Mac's Battery Q. I use my PowerBook G4 at home and on the road, and I would like to maximize the life of its rechargeable battery. Is it best to leave it plugged into a power source at home, or to leave it unplugged so it can discharge and then recharge it as necessary? A. Apple Computer does not recommend leaving the PowerBook plugged in all the time with its lithium-ion battery connected because the internal chemistry can stagnate, which may shorten battery life. Unplugging the laptop and working from the battery once a month or so helps to discharge the stored energy and gets those electrons moving. The company also recommends that you calibrate your laptop's battery every few months. Laptop batteries contain microprocessors that tell the computer how much of a charge is left, but they can get out of sync. This causes the computer to give incorrect information about the charge status. Calibration helps the battery and computer communicate more accurately.
4/7/2005	As the Going Gets Tougher, Nintendo Makes Plans for Some Shopping	Borrowing a page from Apple's marketing playbook, Nintendo, the Japanese video game giant, will open a retail store in Manhattan this spring. The Nintendo World Store, which company officials say will be the first anywhere, will feature many of the company's popular video games and consoles, including the GameCube, Nintendo DS and Game Boy line.
4/7/2005	What Sounds Better: Pay or Play?	To the Editor: As demonstrated by Apple's iTunes online store, people are willing to pay for downloaded music even when the same music is available free elsewhere. Most people are law-abiding. If the music companies were smart, they'd stop fighting new technology and start thinking about how they'll tap the market. Matt Clary Tallahassee, Fla., March 30, 2005
3/31/2005	Cable Lets the IPod Photo Link Directly to a Camera, Bypassing a PC Pit Stop	When the iPod Photo was released last year, it had one shortcoming: it could not display photos loaded directly from a camera. Now Apple offers a $29 accessory that allows photos to be displayed on the iPod Photo without a trip through a computer. The iPod Camera Connector plugs into the data slot on the bottom of the iPod and links to many digital cameras and memory card readers through a U.S.B. cable. (A list of compatible cameras can be found by clicking on the camera connector link at www.apple.com/ipodphoto/accessories.html.)
3/30/2005	Lively Debate As Justices Take On File Sharing	The much-heralded Supreme Court showdown in the Grokster case between old-fashioned entertainment and newfangled technology found the justices surprisingly responsive on Tuesday to warnings from Grokster, the software maker that allows Internet users to share computer files on peer-to-peer networks, that a broad definition of copyright infringement could curtail innovation. Justice David H. Souter asked Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the lawyer arguing for the Hollywood studios and the recording industry, to envision ''a guy sitting in his garage inventing the iPod.''
3/27/2005	From Gutenberg to Gigabytes	EAGER to spread technology to patrons who may not have it, the South Huntington Library has begun lending out iPod Shuffles loaded with popular titles like ''Reading Lolita in Tehran,'' by Azar Nafisi and James Lee Burke's ''In The Moon Of Red Ponies'' in the MP3 digital format. ''The library should be a place where technology can be made available to everybody,'' Ken Weil, the library's director, said of the iPod lending program, which started last month using a $1,300 state grant. The library already provides wireless Internet access in its new building and lets patrons borrow laptops.
3/24/2005	With Mac Mini, Apple Builds a Smaller Box	IT has often been said of personal computers that one day they will be like appliances. And while PC's have taken on some aspects of household machines, they are not necessarily the ones that futurists forecast. Much like, say, washers and dryers, most computers are placed in bulky cabinets styled with all the grace of a metal box and painted in colors selected mostly to avoid offense.
3/24/2005	Apple's Legal Drive to Stifle Web Sites Is Fruitless So Far	Since Apple Computer filed a lawsuit in January against Think Secret, a Web site operated by a 19-year-old Harvard student, accusing the site of publishing Apple's trade secrets, the company has sent a series of cease-and-desist letters to the student, Nicholas M. Ciarelli. So far, the letters appear to have done nothing to reduce Mr. Ciarelli's enthusiasm. He has continued to publish articles about Apple's new product plans.
3/24/2005	A Way to Put Your Music On Hold When the Boss Is on the Line	For some people, a clear advantage of working at home is the ability to play music through the computer. But when the telephone rings, hiding that fact from a distant boss or judgmental colleagues can mean fumbling with the keyboard and the telephone handset at the same time. PocketMac HoldIt automates the computer process for users of Macintosh computers running the current 10.3 operating system. Users who link to the Internet through Wi-Fi wireless links, cable or high-speed D.S.L. lines must first rediscover their computer's built-in modems and connect them to a phone line.
3/21/2005	To Cut Online Chatter, Apple Goes to Court	In the fall of 1981, Paul Freiberger, a reporter for the weekly computer industry newspaper InfoWorld, was preparing to run a story that Apple Computer was engaged in two secret development projects. But first, he listened as company co-founder Steven P. Jobs shouted at him over the phone that revealing the code names of products would offer a crucial advantage to the computer maker's Japanese competitors. In the end, the paper got its scoop -- Apple's new projects were called the Lisa and the Macintosh -- and the company still managed to handily trounce its competitors.
3/21/2005	Dancing Around Journalistic Issues in a Lawsuit Over Apple Secrets	Can a company's interest in protecting corporate secrets trump any privilege protecting the identity of a reporter's sources? That is the question avoided by the judge who is overseeing the lawsuit filed by Apple Computer to learn who disclosed details of a forthcoming product on various Web sites. In an opinion issued earlier this month, Judge James P. Kleinberg of the Santa Clara County Superior Court in San Jose, Calif., allowed Apple to issue a subpoena to the e-mail service provider for one of the Web sites.
3/17/2005	Language Anxiety? Try Immersion Therapy	TECHNOLOGY has not yet produced an effortless way to learn another language, but it can lend a helping hand. Advancements in multimedia and the growth of the Internet have led to an assortment of language tools that can complement academic studies or enable studying on your own schedule.
3/17/2005	Music Buffet: Loading Up For Takeout	A NAPSTER commercial on TV offers the following comparison. On top, there is a single iPod. The cost to fill it, Napster says, is $10,000. Beneath it are three MP3 players: the Dell Pocket DJ, the Creative Zen Micro and iRiver's new H10. With Napster to Go, the commercial says, you can fill all three with almost any song you can think of and you're out only $15. Next to that, in tiny print, are the words ''per month.''
3/17/2005	2,000 Talmud Tapes, Or One Loaded IPod	TWO weeks ago, about 26,000 Orthodox Jews crowded into Madison Square Garden to mark the completion of the Daf Yomi, a seven-and-a-half-year cycle of Talmud learning. Participants in the Daf Yomi -- who number, worldwide, in the hundreds of thousands -- study a page a day of the massive compendium of Jewish oral law, culminating in this celebration, known as the Siyum HaShas. At the door, handing out leaflets beside the Jews for Jesus and the teenage collectors for Jewish charities was a 23-year-old entrepreneur named Yehuda Shmidman. Mr. Shmidman was passing out glossy brochures showing a bearded, black-hatted Orthodox Jew, lighted in silhouette, wearing a pair of white ear buds.
3/17/2005	Security Center Makes Sure You're Alerted	Q. In the last few weeks I have persistently received System Tray balloons with an icon that looks like a shield and a message saying, ''Your computer might be at risk,'' along with other messages about viruses and spyware. What is this? I already use antivirus and antispyware programs. Do I still need to be concerned about these alerts? A. Although it might seem like annoying nagware, that importunate icon shaped like a shield belongs to the Windows Security Center, which is a part of the Windows XP Service Pack 2 system upgrade released by Microsoft last year. Windows Service Pack 2 contains features that are supposed to keep your PC safer from intruders, Internet worms and other online perils; more information for home computer users is at www.microsoft.com/athome/security/default.mspx.
3/13/2005	How the iPod Ran Circles Around the Walkman	SYNERGY AND OTHER LIES'' would be a good first reading assignment for Sir Howard Stringer, Sony's new chief executive, to be followed by ''The Synergy Myth.'' Then Sir Howard should recognize that the Sony he inherits is constitutionally incapable of making one (electronics) plus one (entertainment) equal three. Both books were written by Harold Geneen, the number cruncher who directed International Telephone and Telegraph during its heyday in the 1960's. He engineered 350 mergers and acquisitions, which brought such names as Hartford, Avis, Sheraton and Madison Square Garden under one roof. Mr. Geneen, however, harbored no illusions that ITT's individual components could be coordinated in mutually beneficial ways. Each had to make its numbers wholly on its own.
3/12/2005	Judge Says Apple Can Demand Names of Bloggers	A California judge ruled Friday that Apple Computer has the right to subpoena the names of sources and documents relating to confidential company information that was published late last year by three Web sites. Judge James P. Kleinberg of the Santa Clara County Superior Court in San Jose, Calif., said in a 13-page ruling that Apple's interest in protecting its trade secrets outweighed the public's right to information about Apple and the right of bloggers to disseminate that.
3/11/2005	Apple Backs Sony Format For DVD's	Apple Computer is backing the Sony Corporation's Blu-ray format for the next generation of digital videodiscs, bolstering Sony's effort to dominate the $26 billion United States market for DVD's and players. Apple, whose computers run software to create DVD's, joined the Blu-ray Disc Association's board, a statement by Blu-ray said yesterday. Sony is fighting to win support for its standard over one called HD-DVD that is backed by Toshiba and NEC.
3/10/2005	Good Things Still Come To Those Willing to Wait	IF you fall far enough behind the curve, every once in a while you may appear, oh so briefly, to be in step with the leaders. That insight, delusional as it may be, struck me not long ago when Apple Computer unveiled the Mac Mini in an attempt to lure the Windows crowd to take a walk on the wilder side. Finally, industry analysts cheered, homes that had been Apple-free would have a chance to take a bite for $499.
3/10/2005	A New Techie Mantra: Start Up, Then Sign On	THE story of a technological advance created in a garage by an amateur tinkerer is so common that it has become a clich. Now comes the technological advance that not only comes from a garage, it stays there. Melvin Benzaquen, a New York car restorer, and Thom Greenwald, a musician and computer engineer, have begun installing Apple's new compact desktop computer, the Mac Mini, in cars, including a souped-up 450-horsepower 1969 Nova SS muscle car and a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
3/7/2005	At a Suit's Core: Are Bloggers Reporters, Too?	In the physical world, being labeled a journalist may confer little prestige and may even evoke some contempt. But being a journalist can also confer certain privileges, like the right to keep sources confidential. And for that reason many bloggers, a scrappy legion of online commentators and pundits, would like to be considered reporters, too. A lawsuit filed in California by Apple Computer is drawing the courts into that question: who should be considered a journalist?
3/5/2005	Whose Patent Is It, Anyway?	Each shift, 200 workers, most of them women in smocks and bibs, labor in a factory tucked away in hilly farmland outside this city assembling a single product, one-inch hard drives. As China's emerging industrial centers go, Guiyang is an obscure outpost, bearing little resemblance to the booming factory towns of the east coast. And yet, as much as any other place in China this hard drive assembly may be at the front line of an intense global struggle to dominate high-tech manufacturing.
3/5/2005	Apple Asks Judge to Order Web Sites to Name Sources	A state judge in California heard arguments on Friday in a lawsuit brought by Apple Computer to force three Web site publishers to reveal the names of confidential sources who disclosed to them Apple's plans for future products. The outcome of the lawsuit, which was filed in December, could have far-reaching ramifications for the ability of bloggers to maintain the confidentiality of unnamed sources, which news gatherers often depend on for information.
3/3/2005	Faster Memory Cards Keep Up With the Action	Q. I recently purchased a four-megapixel digital camera and a regular 256-megabyte memory card. The sales clerk suggested that I buy a more expensive ''high speed'' memory card instead. What advantages, if any, would the more expensive card have given me? A. In addition to the various formats of memory cards available for different cameras, newer versions with the enticing label ''high speed'' are available, which may add to consumer confusion. What it boils down to is that certain digital cameras are designed to work with these high-speed memory cards, and they can snap pictures in quicker succession and then copy them to the card much faster than regular memory cards.
2/28/2005	Jef Raskin, 61, Developer of Apple Macintosh	Jef Raskin, a computer technology pioneer who started the team that created the Macintosh computer, died Saturday at his home in Pacifica, Calif., at age 61. The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Linda Blum. Mr. Raskin, who named the Macintosh after his favorite apple but altered the spelling for copyright reasons, played a significant role in transforming computers into friendlier machines, helping to catapult them into the commercial sphere. As the 31st employee at Apple Computer, Mr. Raskin advocated forcefully for the company to develop a computer that was easy for people to use, and he headed the Macintosh project starting in 1979.
2/12/2005	Apple Decides To Split Stock	Apple Computer, whose shares have more than tripled in value in the last year, approved a 2-for-1 stock split on Friday. Apple's stock price has been soaring largely because of the enormous success of Apple's iPod portable music player, which now accounts for nearly 35 percent of Apple's revenues.
2/10/2005	Mac Meets PC And Both Learn to Share	WHEN Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, introduced the $499 Mac Mini in January, he called it a ''bring your own display, keyboard and mouse'' machine. Implicit in that characterization is that the Mini is meant to appeal in part to PC owners who may want to give Apple a try, and who already have those peripherals connected to their Windows machines. The trouble is, if you're going to move your keyboard, mouse and monitor to a Mac, you will no longer be able to use the PC. That may be just fine with Apple, but not for users who don't want to give up their PC. While they may be attracted to the Mac for its easy-to-use software like iPhoto and GarageBand, they may prefer their PC for games or work-related tasks, or they may have one or two PC-only programs that they can't live without.
2/10/2005	Plug an Instrument Into an IPod And Play Along With the Band	One important reason for the iPod's popularity is its versatility: it can be many things to many people. To those, add musicians with thin walls or cranky neighbors. A product called the JamPod can turn an iPod into a portable private amplifier. The JamPod, which can be plugged into the earphone jack with a dock connector, gives electric guitarists an opportunity to shred along to their favorite MP3's.
2/10/2005	Home Video Made to Watch On HDTV	THERE are three good reasons you might not want to read this review of Sony's new HDR-FX1 camcorder. First, it costs $3,300 online(list price: $3,700). Second, it's a big black behemoth, 14 inches long; among the shiny silver microcams at a typical school concert, it would look positively idiotic. Third, it's appallingly basic: it doesn't overlay text or graphics on your video, has no infrared ''night shot'' mode and can't even take still photos (gasp). On the other hand, you might want to read about this machine even if you have no intention of buying it: it's the first three-chip, high-definition camcorder for consumers. That is, like professional TV cameras, it has three light sensors, one for each primary TV color, for superior color capturing. (The only other HDTV consumer camcorder, the JVC GR-HD1, is disdained by many amateur filmmakers because it has only one sensor.)
2/10/2005	AirPort Express Router Moves Off the Outlet and Onto the Desktop	Apple fans, frequently smitten by the company's industrial design as much as by the technology inside its products, often put their devices on display. But AirPort Express, a tiny wireless networking device, plugs directly into a power outlet.
2/3/2005	A Remote for the Times When the IPod Isn't Portable	If you connect your iPod to a stereo, you will not be carrying it in your pocket as you wander around your house. You can keep your finger on the controls, however. The AirClick remote from Griffin Technology allows you to play, skip and repeat tracks from up to 60 feet away. There are AirClick receivers for iPods (shown) and iPod Minis. There is also one that uses a U.S.B. dongle to link with Macintosh and PC computers. All share the same slim white hand-held remote built to match Apple's trademark industrial design. A cradle and a steering wheel strap for quick access at home or in the car are packaged with the remote control and receiver.
1/27/2005	They're Off to See the Wizards	IT was just past noon on a recent weekday at the Apple Store here, and the Genius Bar was buzzing. At one end of the 40-foot maple counter, a cherub-faced Genius in a black T-shirt spoke soothingly to a middle-aged customer whose iPod kept erasing songs. After a few minutes of probing, the Genius announced his diagnosis: the firmware needed updating. Then he showed the man how to do it.
1/27/2005	What the IPods Are Wearing These Days	FOR the iPod, perhaps the toy with the most toys, a couple in Sydney, Australia, want you to consider one more accessory: a sort of sleeping bag, better known as the foofpod. While silicone skins and stretchy cases are common remedies for those seeking iPod protection, Fiona Bury and Shane Wynter offer a softer solution at foofpod.com, which began taking orders in August.
1/27/2005	IPods Act as D.J.'s at Clubs Where Patrons Call the Tunes	''WHOSE iPod is this?'' yelled the manager. ''Is this the Pogues?'' Bar managers do not typically ask their clientele about the songs pumping out of the bar's music system. They tend to have intimate knowledge of the jukebox, or leave music questions to the D.J. But that is changing in some bars, where customers who bring their own iPods have started to take control of the tunes.
1/20/2005	New Ways To Manage Your Photos	IF you're not already aware that 2004 was the Year of the Digital Camera, here are a few clues. It was the year that Kodak stopped making film cameras, the year that digicams were even more popular holiday gifts than DVD players, and the year that three professional photographers I know each decided, with much grumbling, to buy a digital camera -- just to see what all the fuss is about. And if this month is any indication, 2005 will be the Year of the Software to Organize the Pictures You Took With Your Digital Camera.
1/20/2005	Behold The Artful Price Tag	YOU'VE read the same exciting story about design for years. As it goes, corporate America recognizes design as a point of difference, a sales edge, an emotional connection to buyers. And buyers recognize design as fashion, coolness, lifestyle.
1/17/2005	MediaTalk; Is Apple Thinking About Mac TV?	Does Apple Computer have designs on the living room? Onstage at the Macworld Exposition in San Francisco last week, Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, proclaimed 2005 as ''the year of high-definition video,'' a strange declaration from someone who was not trying to sell television sets. He kept his laser-like focus on the iPod and the Mac mini, a new low-priced, book-size computer.
1/16/2005	This Year, Investors Are Saying 'Show Us the Money'	CORPORATE earnings season is upon us -- but is earnings news what the stock market needs right now? Given the optimism that characterized the market rebound at the end of last year and the positive consensus for earnings in the last three months of 2004, the answer should be yes.
1/16/2005	After 20 Years, Finally Capitalizing on Cool	WHEN TV Guide updates its 1999 list of greatest commercials of all time, I must root against the current occupant of the No.1 position: Apple Computer's ''1984,'' broadcast for the 1984 Super Bowl. The ad's indelible image -- a sledge hammer thrown at Big Brother -- makes good art for a museum installation. But for transcendent greatness in the real world, the top spot should go to a more recent instance of Apple-sponsored genius: the iPod commercials. (It doesn't matter which one.) Their shimmying and shaking have firmly established the iPod as the icon of the dawning digital lifestyle and sped 10 million units out the door. Without saying a word, the commercials present viewers with a choice: orgiastic boogaloo-ing with the in crowd, or standing forlornly out of the picture. And now the price of admission is just $99.
1/13/2005	Price Tags Get Smaller At Apple	FOR geeks and gadget freaks, you might expect the holiday season to be the most thrilling time of the year. After all, that's when iPods appear in stockings, digital cameras appear under the tree and flat-panel TV sets appear on the wall. Truth is, though, the real fun doesn't begin until January. That's when two trade shows out West serve as launching pads for new electronic goodies that eventually blow eastward into the eager paws of early adopters.
1/13/2005	Apple's Profit Quadruples, Thanks to IPod	Apple Computer said yesterday that profit in its first quarter more than quadrupled -- the biggest increase ever -- on strong holiday sales of its iPod music player. The results came a day after the company embarked on a strategy to capitalize on the success of the iPod by selling a line of low-cost computers.
1/13/2005	Crisp, Bright Images On Flat-Panel Screens	THREE years ago, liquid-crystal-display computer monitors were mostly sleek, expensive novelty items. Now, of course, every cash register and home computer package comes with one. But the changes in the world of flat-panel displays go beyond affordability. The panels' physical advantages (smaller footprints, lighter weight and lower power consumption) have been matched by technical advances that make them a better choice than traditional monitors for many of the most demanding computer users.
1/13/2005	A Satellite Connection for IPod Reaches Out to Download Radio	Time Trax Technologies, the Washington company that created a stir late last year when it introduced products that allow satellite radio subscribers to record programming to PC's, has followed up with a product that turns iPods into MP3 repositories for hundreds of channels of music and talk from XM and Sirius, the two satellite radio broadcasters. DockTrax is an iPod docking station that connects to a U.S.B. port on any PC. When an iPod is inserted into the cradle, TimeTrax software can schedule recordings of XM or Sirius programs and download them to the iPod as MP3 files. Time Trax says it has taken measures to prevent peer-to-peer file sharing, embedding the serial number of the user's satellite radio receiver onto each MP3 file created.
1/13/2005	Apple Tries to Break Out	Apple Computer's classic advertisements urge buyers to ''think different,'' and this week the company took its own advice. It broke with its longstanding policy of catering to the connoisseurs of high-end cool and unveiled both a $499 desktop computer, called the Mac Mini, and a $99 stripped-down version of the iPod digital music player. We'll see whether the strategy works, but it's interesting to see a company whose customers have always regarded themselves as a lonely elite deciding to try a new direction. Despite Apple's complaints about Microsoft's dominance, one of the biggest drags on Apple's growth has been that its computers generally cost more than similar Windows PC's. But the Mac Mini has a base price hundreds of dollars below what had been Apple's lowest-priced computer. The $499 is misleading because it does not include a monitor, keyboard, mouse and other needed items, but the sticker price may get the attention of some Microsoft users, particularly the millions of people who have been introduced to Apple through iPods.
1/12/2005	Changing Course, Apple Offers Low-Priced Mac for the Home	Apple Computer introduced its first low-priced Macintosh on Tuesday, signaling its bet that most consumers now see computers as simply another appliance in the modern house. While computers have long been sold as machines that can turn a home into an office, most Americans now use them in their bedrooms and kitchens as e-mail terminals; as hubs for playing music, storing and editing photos; and as stations for navigating the Web.
1/11/2005	Free Speech, Or Secrets From Apple?	Against the backdrop of the Macworld Exposition in San Francisco this week, a series of legal actions filed by Apple Computer over the last month highlights the difficulties of defining who is a journalist in the age of the Web log. As part of a lawsuit filed by Apple in Santa Clara County Superior Court on Dec. 13, the company obtained a court order allowing it to issue subpoenas to AppleInsider.com, PowerPage.org and Thinksecret.com. The three Web sites published or linked to information on what they said was a future Apple audio device that was code-named ''Asteroid.'' The subpoenas are aimed at getting the operators of those sites to disclose the sources of the information that was reportedly leaked.
1/10/2005	Talk about suspense: Anticipation builds for Steve Jobs' annual presentation at Macworld.	IN what might be the next episode in Silicon Valley's longest-running soap opera, Apple Computer's chairman, Steven P. Jobs, is planning to surrender to the computer industry's received wisdom and introduce a sub-$500 Macintosh, according to several published reports. So much for ''Think Different.''
1/6/2005	Make a FireWire Connection to Upgrade Your Mac	Q. Is there an easy way to transfer all my files and settings from an old iMac with Jaguar to a new iMac G5 running Panther? A. One relatively hassle-free way of moving the information from one Mac OS X machine to another is to link the two computers with a FireWire cable and let the Mac OS X Setup Assistant program on the new iMac G5 do all the heavy lifting for you. This should work with a Jaguar (Mac OS X 10.2) and the current Panther (Mac OS X 10.3) versions of Apple's Macintosh operating system, as well as other Macs running at least Mac OS X 10.1.
1/5/2005	Album Sales Expected to Show 1.6% Rise	Sales of recorded music in the United States are on the rise for the first time in four years. The recording industry registered sales of about 667 million albums, an increase of about 1.6 percent, according to year-end data expected to be released today by the market research firm Nielsen SoundScan.
12/30/2004	Safe Mode in Windows Helps Fix What Ails It	Q. What is a Safe Mode boot? A. Windows can sometimes be a fussy operating system to start when you turn on the computer and the program senses that something is not quite right. A software installation gone bad, an incompatible device driver or a dynamic library link (D.L.L.) file can interfere with the ability of Windows to boot up properly. When this happens, the computer comes up in Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a diagnostic tool that lets you troubleshoot whatever is ailing Windows. It is a function of just about every version of the operating system Microsoft has released. When the PC starts in Safe Mode, it loads only the components the operating system needs to run. When Windows has opted for Safe Mode, the desktop will not have its usual pattern, the screen will display only 16 colors, and Safe Mode will appear in the corners of the screen.
12/28/2004	Apple Sues to Halt OS X Release on Net	Apple Computer, the maker of iPod digital-music players and Macintosh computers, has sued three software developers, contending they distributed unreleased versions of its OS X computer operating system on the Internet. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco last week, seeks to stop the illegal distribution of Apple products over the Web. It comes after a similar suit filed in California state court earlier in this month. In the latest suit, Apple said its financial performance depended on its ability to protect improvements to its operating system, used in its PowerBook, iMac and other computers. Apple's operating systems represent a ''minority share'' in the personal computer market, ''which is dominated by makers of computers using other operating systems,'' the company said in the lawsuit.
12/23/2004	IPod-to-Car Solution Avoids Some of the Previous Potholes	Music and driving go together like a horse and carriage, but for many iPod owners, crossing the portable player with the car audio system has been an exercise in frustration. FM transmitters can be unreliable in radio-heavy urban areas, and other options require the user to have a certain kind of stereo or car. The iCruze from Monster Cable, however, is designed to work with a large number of factory-installed or aftermarket car audio systems to put the iPod and its music library in the driver's seat.
12/23/2004	Return Policies Vary For Opened Software	Q. How do retail stores or manufacturers handle refunds on software? If I'm not happy with the software, can I get a full refund? The information provided on the box and in the online description is limited. A. In many cases, returning software to the store or manufacturer that you bought it from can be a little tricky if you've already ripped the shrink-wrap or torn open the box.
12/16/2004	And Now For Something Slightly Different	ENTER practically any electronics store and you're likely to find a digital music player from Apple. It's called the iPod and it weighs only a few ounces, but to its competitors it's the 800-pound white gorilla. It is hardly a secret that Apple's smart, sleek music players rule the market. Industry analysts estimate that more than 9 of every 10 high-capacity players sold in the United States are iPods.
12/16/2004	With Mini's Rivals, More Is Sometimes Less	IN February, Apple followed up its wildly popular iPod music player with the iPod Mini. This smaller, sleeker $250 player could hold 1,000 songs and came in five brushed-aluminum colors. But for only $50 more, you could buy a regular iPod that could hold four times as much music. Logical observers could draw only one possible conclusion: that Apple was out of its number-crunching mind. The San Jose Mercury News called the iPod Mini ''cool, colorful and too expensive.'' PC Magazine wrote that ''you are paying dearly for the miniaturization.'' And Business Week Online declared it doomed, another of the occasional ''fits of delusion'' by Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive.
12/16/2004	It Glistens While You Listen: An iPod Wrapped in Crystal	Twinkle and tech have produced a love child: the Crystalmini (above) from Simple Solutions Technologies, which takes the four-gigabyte iPod mini and gives it the Hollywood star treatment, paving it all over with Swarovski crystals. The pink Jaguar model shown is $999 at www.crystalmini.com. Other models are available for $699 to $999, as are higher-price custom versions. The company, which is not affiliated with Apple, offers its own one-year warranty on both the music player and the crystals. (Embellishing an electronic device usually voids its original warranty.) Some styles are available at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan; (212) 705-2000.
12/15/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Some Apple iPods Said To Be Altered	RealNetworks, which sells songs on the Web, said yesterday that Apple Computer had altered the software for some of its market-leading iPod digital music players so that music purchased from RealNetworks would not play. The changes affect the new iPod Photo, a RealNetworks spokesman, Matt Graves, said in an interview.
12/10/2004	I.B.M. Bids the PC Adieu	The news that I.B.M. is selling its personal computer division is not very surprising. The bloom is long gone off the PC market, profits have plummeted, and the machine has become utterly generic. The brand on the box matters less than it ever has. And that is the direct result of decisions made by I.B.M. before it introduced its first PC in 1981. In those days, the personal computer was synonymous with Apple, which kept a close hold on its machines. I.B.M. chose to create a PC with parts developed by other manufacturers. It was a great way to get computers into the hands of consumers and to guarantee plenty of competition. But it also meant that the only powerful proprietary grasp to arise from the PC belonged to Intel, which made the processor chips, and to Microsoft, which licensed the operating system called MS-DOS.
12/9/2004	Command Demystifies Missing Music Files	Q. I have some songs that play fine with the iTunes program, but when I look for the song files on my hard drive, I can't find them. How can I find these files? A. Apple's iTunes for Windows and Macintosh is a versatile music-management program that can do everything from converting songs from CD's to computer-friendly digital audio files to loading up your iPod and printing fancy jewel-case covers for homemade mixes you make for friends and loved ones. Although iTunes keeps its own default folder to store the audio files you make from CD's or for tracks you purchased from the online iTunes Music Store, the files do not have to be in this folder for iTunes to display or play them. That makes it possible for songs all around your hard drive to be listed in your iTunes database, regardless of whether they reside in the iTunes Music folder.
12/9/2004	Maroon 5 Makes Room on the IPod for Schoolwork	FOR Samantha Greene's parents, there was no getting around it: she had to have an iPod this year. Everybody at school was getting one. At the Brearley School, a private school for girls on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where Samantha is in the eighth grade, the iPod went from a ''want'' to a ''must have'' this year when its use was incorporated into foreign-language and classics courses. For about 300 girls in grades 7 through 12, the iPod is now required to do homework and classroom assignments.
12/9/2004	Stay in Control Wirelessly When Your PC Is the Media Hub	It's no secret that streaming movies and music from a computer to a TV or stereo has moved into the mainstream in the last couple of years. An unresolved question is how to easily control the digital media on your computer remotely.
12/5/2004	My Ipod, My World. Oh! We're There?	MARC KESLOW'S worst commuting nightmare isn't missing his train or having to stand all the way to Manhattan. It is running out of battery power for his iPod. Mr. Keslow says the iPod, the portable music player made by Apple Computer, has dramatically changed his commute. He listens to it while walking to the station in Greenwich, on the train and on the subway, and on the final 10-minute walk to his office.
12/3/2004	So Much More Than Music to My Ears	To the Editor: I enjoyed ''To Know Me, Know My IPod'' (Week in Review, Nov. 28), but it gives a one-dimensional view of what goes on inside the head of an iPod user. Certainly the player presents the opportunity for storing and organizing vast quantities of music, which is great, but there is another world out there (in there?) that can fill a 20- or 40-gigabyte hard drive: books.
11/28/2004	Ideas & Trends; To Know Me, Know My IPod	SOMEHOW, I had ended up inside of Ken's head -- in Kenworld. Kenneth Chang is a colleague who recently sold me his iPod. After just a few months, he needed one with more storage.
11/14/2004	Gates vs. Jobs: The Rematch	THE history of Apple Computer can be told through its advertisements as well as its products. There was, of course, the commercial that introduced the Macintosh. It was broadcast exactly once, during the 1984 Super Bowl, and signaled the company's bid to reclaim leadership in personal computers from I.B.M. and its tiny, little-known software partner, Microsoft. Late last month, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chairman, rented an ornate theater here to promote Apple's latest advertisement for its iPod music player -- a crisp psychedelic montage of the Irish pop band U2 playing ''Vertigo,'' a song from its next album. Unlike the 1984 commercial, this one is intended to help Apple preserve a big, and growing, lead in the marketplace.
11/4/2004	Power Pack for an IPod Keeps the Music Playing	Even if the battery on your iPod is in tiptop shape, it may not be enough. Eight hours, even 12, will not fill the time on a flight from New York to New Zealand, or on a weekend camping trip. At such times the next best thing to carrying a generator with you might be the TunePower, a rechargeable battery pack from Belkin.
10/31/2004	The Old New Thing	The Newton Some consumer products are famous for inspiring something that is more powerful than mere loyalty in their customer base. ''Customer'' isn't even the right word -- ''follower'' is more like it -- and what these people feel is devotion. Apple Computer is frequently used as an example of a company that makes such products. Aside from partisans for the Macintosh, there are also many determined fans of a smaller, hand-held device who are so united in their devotion that they form a kind of secret society. No, not iPod fans. Newton fans. The devotion of Newton users is all the more extraordinary because the product, introduced in the early 1990's, was a notorious flop. The Newton, you may recall, was a forerunner of today's popular Personal Digital Assistants, like the PalmPilot, that rely on a penlike stylus. (According to the lore, a series of ''Doonesbury'' installments mocking early handwriting-recognition problems was a pivotal event in the Newton's sad trajectory; in any case, this was an instance when the ''early adopters'' so beloved by tech-business gurus were laughed out of the room.) The Newton was killed off by Apple in 1998; yet consumer loyalty has outlived production itself. Thousands of Newton believers congregate by way of Web sites and e-mail lists like the Newted Community and NewtonTalk and in real-world user groups or even at last month's Worldwide Newton Conference in Paris.
10/28/2004	The IPod's New Trick: Photo Show	All right, Apple. The iPod has 92 percent of the market for high-capacity music players. You sold two million of them in the last quarter alone. Your music store, whose songs play only on the iPod, has 70 percent of the online song sales market, and you've just rolled it out in 10 new countries. What on earth do you do for an encore?
10/28/2004	PC's Can Speak Up For the Vision Impaired	Q. My 82-year-old aunt is slowly losing her sight, but she loves her computer and uses it every day. Are there software programs that will convert text to speech to help her keep up with e-mail and Web pages? A. Both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems offer some built-in functions to help people with visual impairments use the computer. There are also commercial programs that can read aloud text on the screen.
10/28/2004	New Food for IPods: Audio by Subscription	TUCKED away in their old farmhouse in Wayne, Wis., surrounded by dairy farms and cornfields, Dawn Misceli, 28, and Drew Domkus, 33, sit in their living room most nights and talk to each other as they normally would, cracking jokes and enjoying life as a young married couple. But a few hundred people get to listen in on a half-hour of the conversation from a distance, on computers and portable music players. They do so by way of a podcast, a new method of online audio distribution that has hundreds of amateur broadcasters springing up on the Internet.
10/27/2004	Newest IPod From Apple Holds Photos And Music	Apple Computer introduced on Tuesday its next generation iPod music player, which has the ability to display digital images as well as play songs. The new iPod Photo, priced at $499 and $599, will be able to store up to 25,000 wallet-size digital images and display them on a television via a cable. It comes with 40-gigabyte or 60-gigabyte disk storage, capable of storing up to 15,000 songs.
10/24/2004	Pixar's Mr. Incredible May Yet Rewrite the Apple Story	EVEN his biggest fans might see Steven P. Jobs, Apple Computer's chief executive, as a brilliant dunce. He has the absolutely best software to run a personal computer but can't figure out how to convert technical superiority into the industry standard. He has the absolutely best portable player for tunes but can't figure out how to convert market dominance on the music side into increased market share on the computer side. He's capable of better, much better. His record as C.E.O. of Pixar Animation Studios -- he somehow serves as the boss of two publicly traded companies -- suggests that, at Apple, he may yet pass from erratically great to best of the best. In the early years at Pixar, he had incredible technology and no idea what to do with it. But once the strategic vision came into focus, he started on a roll that is unlike any other and continues to this day.
10/21/2004	Google Takes On Your Desktop	THE modern PC is a marvel, isn't it? Here's a machine that lets an ordinary person with very little training create a new document, check its spelling, dress it up with graphics, send it electronically to someone across the globe -- and then save it accidentally into some dark corner of the hard drive, where it will never be seen again. Of course, every operating system offers a Find command. But the one in Windows is not, ahem, Microsoft's finest work. It requires too many clicks, it asks too many questions, it takes forever, it can't search your e-mail and its results are difficult to interpret. As a final insult, Microsoft endowed the supposedly ultramodern Windows XP with a cartoon dog that appears during the searching, as though to say, ''We know this is taking a long time, but hey, watch the puppy!''
10/18/2004	MediaTalk; Now Showing at Apple: The Return of Mr. Jobs	Steven P. Jobs, founder of Apple Computer Inc. and the computer industry's premier impresario, usually announces new products in front of thousands of cheering Macintosh aficionados. Last Thursday, however, he unveiled the first of Apple's new line of mini-retail stores in Palo Alto, Calif., with an understated flourish in front of a small gathering of reporters, cameramen and Apple Computer employees. In part, the more important unveiling was Mr. Jobs himself, who was making his first public appearance since undergoing cancer surgery in July.
10/14/2004	Apple's 4th-Quarter Profit More Than Doubled	Apple Computer announced yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled because of continued strong sales of iPod music players, beating Wall Street estimates by a wide margin despite a shortage of the semiconductors that are used in some of its computers. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported net income of $106 million, or 26 cents a share, for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 25. That compared with a profit of $44 million, or 12 cents a share, in last year's fourth quarter. Analysts had estimated profit of 18 cents a share on revenue of $2.15 billion.
10/14/2004	Fitting Your PC In a Pocket	IN the last few years, the biggest breakthroughs in personal computing haven't had much to do with personal computers. Instead, many of the most exciting and popular inventions have been designed to let you carry a copy of the data that's on the PC you already have. What's an iPod, for example, but a $300 portable hard drive containing a copy of your PC's music files? What's a Palm or PocketPC but a $300 data bucket for carrying away a copy of the PC's calendar and address book? And what's a BlackBerry but a $400 mirror image of the PC's e-mail?
10/14/2004	Be Commander in Chief Of a 30-Foot Radius	Multimedia keyboards that can control your digital-audio software and other programs have been around for a while, but the new Belkin MediaPilot keyboard can reach all the way across the living room to control the CD player, TV and other devices in the home entertainment center. An integrated remote control on the keyboard can direct eight different machines and can learn the infrared codes needed to do it from a wide variety of audio and video components.
10/11/2004	Sampling a World of New Ways to Grapple With the Web	At the moment, at least eight different Web browsers reside in my computer. There's no earthly reason to have so many except for the slightly obsessive fun of it. And these are just the non-arcane browsers -- the ones that didn't ask me to install supporting programs I don't understand. I've also resisted the temptation to build my own browser, which is the kind of project computer magazines like to publish. I know what my do-it-yourself browser would look like. The decals would be crooked and the paint would have fingerprints on it, just like the model airplanes I built as a kid. The number and diversity of these browsers is, to me, a very hopeful sign. Not that long ago, Microsoft and Netscape were fighting for control of the computer desktop, a battle that still goes on in one form or another. Microsoft argued that only a browser tightly integrated with the rest of the operating system could deliver the seamless, gratifying Web-browsing experience most people hope for.
10/4/2004	Battle of Form (And Function) In MP3 Players	As the trading of MP3 files ate into music sales, Damon Dash, the 33-year-old entrepreneur behind Roc-A-Fella Records, turned his hip-hop music company into a platform to sell other, more profitable products. He built Rocawear, a hip-hop-inspired clothing line, into a $300-million-a-year business. He launched Armadale Vodka, Tiret New York luxury watches and America, an urban luxury fashion magazine. He even bought the venerable Pro-Keds name to use on a new line of athletic shoes.
9/30/2004	A Transfusion of Fresh Power For an IPod on Its Last Legs	Music may last forever, but batteries do not. The battery life -- and life expectancy -- of Apple's iPod has been a hot topic among the faithful since the earliest models began to reach an advanced age. To help revive iPods with power cells that can no longer hold a charge, Newer Technology and Other World Computing have entered the iPod-parts business, introducing a high-capacity lithium-ion cell that can last longer than the iPod's original battery.
9/27/2004	Music Sites Ask, 'Why Buy If You Can Rent?'	Long before Sir Richard Branson dreamed of becoming the latest billionaire with a reality TV show, before he started his cellphone company, his airline and his record label, he sold music from the Virgin Record Shop on Oxford Street in London. When he began in 1971, of course, music was presented as grooves pressed into a vinyl disk. Today, Sir Richard starts a new music store, VirginDigital.com, this time selling music as streams of bits to be downloaded from the Internet. Virgin, a unit of the Virgin Group, becomes the first major music retailer to enter the download market, which has been dominated by Apple Computer and other technology companies.
9/21/2004	For Buyers Who Have No Time, Tips for Choosing a ... Computer	WHEN it comes to the PC needs of most small businesses, what is important is not speed but stability. ''The No. 1 mistake small-business owners make is that they buy more PC than they need,'' said Leo Laporte, a consultant and host of ''Call for Help,'' a PC support program on the TechTV network in Canada.
9/16/2004	Take Along the Music In All Its Many Formats	Q. Are there digital audio players that support not only MP3, WAV and Apple Lossless file formats, but also SHN and FLAC files? A. Digital audio file formats abound on the Internet, and two types that are becoming more common as a result of legal online sharing of concert recordings are Shorten, or SHN, and Free Lossless Audio Codec, FLAC. While you can usually find a software program to play the files on your desktop computer, finding a portable audio player that can understand some of the lesser-known formats can still be a bit of a challenge.
9/16/2004	Infineon To Pay a Fine In the Fixing Of Chip Prices	Federal prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they had cracked a global cartel that had illegally fixed prices of memory chips in personal computers and servers for three years, and that one of the companies involved, Infineon Technologies, had agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count and pay a fine of $160 million. At a news conference announcing the plea agreement, R. Hewitt Pate, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, said Infineon had participated in a series of discussions in the United States and elsewhere from July 1999 through June 2002 to set prices of memory equipment, known as dynamic random access memory, or DRAM. Such chips are used in an array of consumer and industrial products, including cellphones, hand-held organizers, digital cameras, television sets, games and MP3 music players. The American market for the memory equipment is about $5 billion a year.
9/16/2004	The Desktop Gets an IPod Of Its Own	GOOD morning, and welcome to ''Name That Apple!'' Fingers on buzzers? All right, let's begin. For 100 points: It's a compact rectangular slab that plays great-sounding music from a built-in hard drive. The front is shiny white acrylic with a screen at the top. The corners and edges of the back panel are gently rounded. Over all, the simplicity and purity of its design give this machine a calm, elegant beauty. Name that Apple!
9/15/2004	Yahoo to Buy Online Music Seller for $160 Million	In a move to expand its role in the online music business, Yahoo announced yesterday that it would buy Musicmatch, a company that sells music online, for $160 million. The move puts Yahoo in direct competition with Apple Computer's iTunes, Microsoft's new music store and RealNetworks in the small but growing market for online downloads of music. Yahoo already has a significant advertiser-supported free music business, with Internet radio and music video channels, along with information and discussion boards about music. The services are based on technology it acquired with Launch Media, which it bought in 2001 for $12 million. Yahoo has also introduced an Internet radio service that offers more choices and better sound quality but charges a fee. But until now, it has not offered users the ability to buy and download songs.
9/9/2004	Technology Briefing | People: Apple Computer Chief To Return	After undergoing surgery in late July for a rare form of pancreatic cancer, Apple Computer's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, left, is on the road to recovery and plans to return to full-time work later this month. Mr. Jobs, who underwent successful surgery to remove cancer from his pancreas, is attending some company meetings and plans to return to full-time work later this month, an Apple spokeswoman, Katie Cotton, said. The rare cancer was a far more curable form than typical pancreatic cancer, Mr. Jobs wrote in an e-mail message to employees after his surgery. At the time of his surgery, Mr. Jobs, 49, had estimated he would return to work in September. That apparently is on track. Tim Cook, an executive vice president who oversees Apple's sales, operations and Macintosh unit, has been running the company's daily operations during Mr. Jobs's absence.
9/2/2004	A Windows IPod Experience (Don't Forget the Tattoo)	It is not blue and they are not calling it the hPod, but Hewlett-Packard announced last week that it was finally releasing its answer to Apple Computer's iPod digital music player, originally promised earlier this year. Now known officially as the Apple iPod From HP, the music player will be available in early September at hpshopping.com and at Best Buy, CompUSA, Radio Shack and Costco. ''We are taking digital music to the mass market,'' said Vyomesh Joshi, an executive vice president at Hewlett-Packard, who said the company wanted to tailor the iPod experience for the Windows user. The Apple iPod From HP is essentially the same white hardware as the most recent version of the iPod from Apple, available with either a 20-gigabyte hard drive ($300) or a 40-gigabyte drive ($400) to hold songs and data.
9/2/2004	Microsoft Challenges Rivals With New Online Music Service	Microsoft started selling music tracks yesterday on its MSN online service, taking on Apple Computer and a host of others in the fast-growing market for digital music. The much-anticipated new service, called MSN Music, is a significant milestone for Microsoft as it tries to expand into a digital entertainment powerhouse. So far, downloaded music accounts for only 2 percent of all music sales in the United States, but analysts expect the market to take off in the next few years.
9/2/2004	Protecting Your Files When a Password Isn't Enough	IT'S a prospect that nobody likes to think about: a laptop or hand-held computer left behind on a train or bus -- or worse, stolen. As people amass larger amounts of personal and business data on their hard disks, it becomes increasingly important to make sure that confidential files will stay that way, even if a machine is lost.
9/2/2004	Problems Printing? One Error Decoded	Q. What is Spool32? It often shows up in error messages when I try to print. A. Spool32.exe is a small program used by older versions of the Windows operating system, including Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME. The primary responsibility of Spool32 is to manage files that have been sent to the printer.
9/2/2004	Missing Link for the Mac User Who Craves a BlackBerry	As the BlackBerry wireless e-mail device has grown into a full-fledged computer, it has left Macintosh users behind. The software provided by Research in Motion, BlackBerry's maker, for synchronizing address book and calendar data runs only on Windows-based computers. Now Information Appliance Associates, a company that makes software for linking Macs with PocketPC devices, has a $30 piece of software for Mac users who want to be BlackBerry owners.
9/1/2004	New IMac Makes Debut a Bit Later Than Apple Hoped	Apple Computer on Tuesday introduced an updated version of its iMac home computer with a minimalist all-in-one system that hides the computer's internal components inside a flat- panel L.C.D. display. The new computer, housed in a luminescent white plastic case, succeeds the current iMac, which has a separate screen and processing unit and has been affectionately nicknamed the ''iLamp'' by Apple fans.
8/30/2004	Can Microsoft Stomp iTunes With a Store Of Its Own?	When Microsoft unveils its online music store later this week, the first song offered should be Dave Brubeck's ''It's Dj Vu All Over Again.'' For Microsoft, taking a trail blazed by others -- then trying to dominate the market -- is a familiar tune. With the opening on Thursday, Microsoft will land itself in a market that Apple Computer pioneered more than a year ago with its iTunes online music store, in much the same way that it took on Netscape in the Web browser business and Sony in the market for console game machines. As a storefront on the MSN online service, Microsoft's music service will offer song tracks for downloading to personal computers and portable music players.
8/26/2004	Tunes, a Hard Drive And (Just Maybe) a Brain	WHILE Bob Angus was presiding over a summer dinner party at his Upper West Side apartment in Manhattan, his Apple iPod decided to reveal its softer side. Mr. Angus, a second-year graduate student at Columbia Business School, had selected the Shuffle Songs mode on his iPod, which was connected by an adapter cable to his stereo receiver. By doing this, he relinquished control of his 1,300-song music library -- and, as he would soon find out, of his party.
8/26/2004	A Digital Divide	Everyone covets a piece of Apple Computer's iPod. And for good reason. It essentially defines what consumers want in a digital music player: capacity, style, seamless integration with personal computers and, through them, access to an enormous musical database. The iPod itself has been wildly successful with consumers, and that translates into profits. The iTunes Music Store has been no less successful in its way, though it has been slower to make money. Apple's business strategy is to maintain control over both the music and its digital player. Some companies want to outdo the iPod with players of their own; others aim to compete with the iTunes Music Store. And some, like RealNetworks, want to be able to sell music from their online store for use on the iPod. That has led to an escalating feud between Apple and RealNetworks.
8/19/2004	In the Classroom, Web Logs Are the New Bulletin Boards	LAST spring, when Marisa L. Dudiak's second-grade class in Frederick County, Md., returned from a field trip to a Native American farm, all the students wanted to do was talk about what they saw. But instead of leading a discussion about the trip, Mrs. Dudiak had the students sign on to their classroom Web log. There they wrote about learning to use a bow and arrow, sitting inside a tepee and petting a buffalo. The short entries were typical of second-grade writing, with misspelled words and simple sentences. Still, for Mrs. Dudiak, the exercise proved more fruitful than a group discussion or a handwritten entry in a personal journal.
8/17/2004	RealNetworks Plans to Sell Digital Music at Half Price	RealNetworks plans to announce on Tuesday that it is putting its digital music offerings on sale at half price as part of an aggressive strategy to force its way onto Apple Computer's popular iPod digital music player. At the same time, the company acknowledged that the sale -- which lowers the price of songs on the online RealPlayer Music Store to 49 cents and the cost of most albums to $4.99, tentatively through Labor Day -- would have an impact on the company's finances.
8/10/2004	Seeing Google With the Eyes of Forrest Gump	Any investor intent on Google might do well to remember Gump. When the makers of the 1994 movie ''Forrest Gump'' sought a plot device that would render its main character fabulously rich, they cast him as an early investor in what Forrest Gump described as ''some kind of fruit company'': Apple Computer. By dumb luck, the movie suggested, its guileless hero had amassed so many millions that he could finance a Gump Medical Center, build a Baptist church and allow the family of his fallen friend Bubba to live in luxury.
8/6/2004	Loving Google but Not Its Public Offering	In Silicon Valley, hackers, engineers, venture capitalists and sales executives love to use Google. Just do not ask them to bet on it.
8/5/2004	Eyes on the Road, Tunes in the Ear	EVEN Apple acknowledges that there is one place its popular iPod music players can't easily go: for a ride in an automobile. ''We've heard from our iPod customers that we could really improve upon the experience in the car,'' said Stanley Ng, director of iPod product lines at Apple.
8/2/2004	The Cellphone's Next Makeover: Affordable Jukebox on the Move	First there was the ring tone. Then the camera. Now the music player. In its relentless push to add features to cellphones, the wireless industry is preparing to make affordable new phones that can store and play full-length downloaded music tracks.
8/2/2004	Apple Chief Has Emergency Cancer Surgery	Steven P. Jobs, co-founder and chief executive of Apple Computer, underwent emergency cancer surgery on Saturday. In an e-mail message sent Sunday to Apple employees, he said that the surgery had gone well and that he would return to work in September. Mr. Jobs, 49, said he had a form of pancreatic cancer that can be cured by surgical removal of the tumor. He said he would not have chemotherapy or radiation treatments.
8/1/2004	To Share or Not to Share	LAST fall, Pennsylvania State University asked 300 students which dorm amenities they wanted most. Music, they said. Even more than cable television, they wanted access to music, and they weren't talking about plugging in a stereo. Today, access to music means finding a path through the maze of digital music options while dodging lawsuits for illegal file sharing. The Recording Industry Association of America has so far sued more than 3,000 people, many of them students, for stealing music from unauthorized networks like Kazaa. Penn State and the University of Rochester have led the way by forging deals with Napster, the once-renegade network that now works with record companies to sell digital music. New this fall, Cornell, George Washington, Wright State and Middlebury will also offer Napster free.
7/30/2004	Apple Attacks RealNetworks Plan to Sell Songs for iPod	Apple Computer sharply criticized RealNetworks, the maker of media-playing software, on Thursday, saying it was investigating the legal implications of RealNetworks's decision to sell songs in Apple's music format. It accused RealNetworks of adopting ''the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod.'' Apple issued its angry statement just four days after RealNetworks started giving away software called Harmony that lets people download songs from its online music store and play them on Apple's popular iPod portable music players, as well as players using Windows Media Player and the Helix format from RealNetworks.
7/27/2004	A low-fare airline tries to build brand awareness by giving away goodies like guitars and Apple iPods.	FOR once, an airline may have hit on a promotional idea that its competitors will not find easy to copy. Starting today, Song, the low-fare brand created last year by Delta Air Lines, will be trying to build traffic and brand awareness by giving away, of all things, guitars. Apple Mini iPod music players and free downloads of songs from iTunes will also be offered. But the Gibson Les Paul Junior electric guitars engraved with the Song logo are the eye-catchers in an offbeat promotion for an airline whose future is in a whole lot more doubt than than that of rock n' roll.
7/27/2004	Cellphones, Say Hello to iTunes	Starting next year, users of Apple Computer's iTunes music service will be able to play songs on some Motorola cellphones, the companies said late Monday. The agreement is the first for the cellular phone industry, which is eager to add functions to phones to bring in additional revenue.
7/26/2004	RealNetworks Plans to Sell Songs to Be Played on IPod	RealNetworks Inc., the maker of media-playing software, has grown tired of waiting for Apple Computer Inc. to share. Tomorrow, without Apple's authorization, RealNetworks will start to give away software that will allow people to buy and download songs from its online music store and then play them on Apple's popular iPod portable devices in addition to those that use the Windows Media Player format and RealNetworks' Helix format.
7/22/2004	Apple's Base Station: No Wires, Lots of Bells and Whistles	IN his weekly ''60 Minutes'' commentary a couple of years ago, the inimitable Andy Rooney groused about the number of cables in our lives. ''Look behind the television set in your living room. It's a rat's nest of electrical cords,'' he said. ''All different -- no two the same. If Thomas Edison was so smart, how come he didn't come up with one cord that fits everything?'' Of course, it wouldn't be very hard for Mr. Rooney to answer his own question. To find out why cords are designed to fit only specific connectors, all he'd have to do is plug his headphones into an electrical outlet, just once.
7/22/2004	Revamped IPod Adds Juice And a Clickable Scroll Wheel	Apple Computer released the latest reworking of its versatile iPod digital music player this week, but did not reinvent the wheel this time -- the device's scroll wheel, that is. To navigate menus and control song playback, the new, fourth-generation iPods use the same springy touch-sensitive ''click wheel'' as the company's candy-colored iPod Mini models, released earlier this year. In addition to simplified scrolling and a slimmer design, the new iPods claim a longer rechargeable battery life, up to 12 hours, compared with the 8 hours offered by last year's model. Apple has also reworked the iPod's main menu screen, adding a Music category for tune-related tasks and placing the player's Shuffle Songs command right out front for those who want to sample their collections randomly without wasting time.
7/19/2004	ITunes Shores Up Its Defenses As Rivals Prepare to Invade	When Kevin Britten won Apple Computer's sweepstakes for downloading song number 100 million from the iTunes service last week, the 20-year-old Kansas resident disappointed customers who had been tracking iTunes sales in hopes of winning a Mac, an iPod music player and 10,000 free songs. But with the arrival of new competitors in online music this year and powerful new threats from the Microsoft Corporation and others, Apple is going to have to come up with a lot more than contests to keep market share. The company is focusing on making its music service as much an experience as a store, and is enhancing features to turn casual browsers into repeat customers.
7/15/2004	IPod Demand Leads Big Increase in Earnings for Apple	Apple Computer said on Wednesday that its fiscal third-quarter profit tripled, led by surging demand for the iPod portable music player and higher sales of its Macintosh computers. ''It was an outstanding quarter -- our highest third-quarter revenue in eight years,'' Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, said. ''Our Mac sales were up 19 percent, and we're thrilled with that.''
7/11/2004	Gates and Jobs, Together at Last	Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have been celebrated in books, magazines, newspapers, even a television movie. Now comes musical theater. Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner, authors of ''The Bomb-itty of Errors,'' an award-winning, hip-hop Shakespearean play, have written ''Nerds,'' which they call ''a musical software satire.'' It is to be performed this week at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
7/8/2004	A Military Mission With Style: Guarding a Sleek Music Player	If you take your iPod to the beach this summer, you could keep it protected in a plastic bag. But for a stronger and more stylish alternative, consider the oPod, by OtterBox Products (www.otterbox.com). The oPod is an iPod-size version of the water-resistant, dust-, crush- and shockproof cases the military uses to protect hand-held computers. And unlike some water-resistant boxes for the iPod, it gives users access to all of the device's controls except the hold switch.
7/4/2004	From a High-Tech System, Low-Fi Music	THE human genome must contain instructions that make building personal music collections a primal biological need. If you find yourself guiltily spending $2,000 a week at the iTunes Music Store from Apple Computer, you're not alone, historically speaking. In inflation-adjusted dollars, that's what the early adopter in 1890 was spending -- yes, weekly -- on phonograph records. Today, Apple's ingenious combination of the iPod, a marvel of design, and its iTunes store makes collecting and playing music ridiculously easy, impeccably legal and impossible to resist.
6/29/2004	Apple Putting More Focus On Simplifying Searching	Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple Computer, demonstrated on Monday his answer to one of computing's most pressing problems: searching for files and information stored on desktop computers. At a meeting here of some 3,500 software developers, Mr. Jobs showed off a coming feature for Apple computers, called Spotlight, that will allow users to search quickly for words and concepts stored on a hard drive by using search technology borrowed from the company's iTunes online music service. The feature will be part of the next version of the Macintosh operating system, called Tiger, which is scheduled for release in the first half of next year.
6/24/2004	From a Tiny Plug, a Cable-Free Household	Many people freed from the tangled tyranny of cables cannot imagine life without their wireless networks. Now a tiny new creation from Apple Computer makes it possible to go wireless from any room that has a broadband connection. Shiny, white and weighing in at just seven ounces, the Apple AirPort Express mobile base station plugs right into an electrical outlet and has jacks on the underside to connect a broadband Ethernet cable and a U.S.B. cable. Once the base station is set up, nearby computers with wireless cards can tap right into the Internet or print to a connected U.S.B.-enabled printer.
6/22/2004	Technology Briefing | Deals: Apple and BMW To Adapt iPods For Cars	Apple Computer and the BMW Group announced an agreement yesterday to permit Apple's iPod digital music players to integrate more easily with certain BMW and Mini Cooper models. An adapter designed by the two companies makes it possible to play music through the car's stereo by plugging the iPod into a cable in the car's glove compartment. Once installed, the system makes it possible to control the iPod from the steering wheel of the car. The adapter will cost $149, plus installation, and will be available this summer. John Markoff (NYT)
6/21/2004	European Labels Hope Piracy Succumbs to Digital Services	After several rocky years for the European music business, some of the biggest labels are hoping that the new digital music services can help stem the tide. Apple Computer Inc. started its iTunes service in Britain, France and Germany last week, about a month after Roxio Inc.'s Napster opened in Britain. Sony's Connect service is preparing to join them in Britain, France and Germany by next week Wednesday.
6/10/2004	Pipe Down, PC	To the Editor: I read ''To Quiet a Whirring Computer, Fight Noise With Noise'' (What's Next, May 27) with amusement and, as a devoted Mac user, irritation. I've had my Apple iMac since 1999, and to this day it has failed to make any undesirable noise whatsoever. The engineers at Apple, who are long used to thinking outside the box, cool the circuit boards silently, by convection. Will PC designers ever adopt a tao of simplicity? David Knight San Francisco
5/27/2004	The Mac Get Its Big Break: A Role in Home Theaters	Macintosh multimedia mavens who are dismayed by the multitude of Windows-based products that connect the computer to the home-entertainment altar finally have a device to call their own. The EyeHome digital media player from Elgato Systems is a small silver box that links the Mac to the television set so that music, photo and video files stored on the computer's hard drive can be seen and heard through the TV and home theater system. The EyeHome works with Apple's iTunes and iPhoto programs and can also play television shows that have been recorded on the Mac's hard drive with Elgato's separate EyeTV digital video recording system. Although it cannot play iMovie projects, the EyeHome can play video files in the MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and DivX formats. Software for organizing multimedia files on the Mac and a small remote control are also included.
5/20/2004	Mac Office: Windows All Over	SHORTLY after Microsoft releases a new version of its Office software, its designers begin to discuss what to put into the next version. Driving these meetings, no doubt, is a painful question: ''How on earth will we come up with more features that we didn't think of last year, or the year before that -- especially when most people consider Office too bloated already?'' Last year, Office 2003 for Windows revealed the company's latest strategy: Add very, very little, and hope that people upgrade anyway.
5/19/2004	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Creates iPod Unit	Apple Computer Inc. has quietly reorganized its product development activities, creating a new division for its fast-selling iPod digital music players. Jon Rubinstein, an Apple senior vice president who has headed hardware engineering for Apple, will lead the new division. As part of the reorganization, Timothy D. Cook, an Apple executive vice president who has led Apple's worldwide sales and operations, will be in charge of a newly organized Macintosh division. Tim Bucher, currently in charge of Macintosh system development, will lead Macintosh hardware engineering. The reorganization was announced Monday in a companywide internal e-mail message sent by Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. The shift reflects Apple's intention to transform its successful iPod into a broader consumer products line, according to a person close to the reorganization. The company made the shift in an effort to improve its ability to focus resources more appropriately, according to an Apple spokeswoman. John Markoff (NYT)
5/4/2004	Silicon Valley Gears Up for Another Big Thing	COMPUTER makers, software designers and telecommunications companies are scrambling to incorporate wireless capabilities into their business strategies. The rush to be at the forefront of what is seen as the next big thing -- high-speed wireless Internet communications -- has drawn players ranging from some of Silicon Valley's most venerable giants to aggressive new start-ups. Here are a few examples: INTEL Intel, the world's largest chip maker, has made considerable progress in helping liberate computer users from phone lines. At the center of its strategy is its Centrino chip set, designed specifically to enable laptops to use Wi-Fi, the most common type of wireless network. Intel has spent nearly $300 million to market Centrino, and its venture capital group has invested more than $4 billion on various wireless start-ups.
4/30/2004	What's on Your Playlist?	When a corporation misses its projections by 30 percent, you're entitled to think that something has gone wrong. Apple -- once just a computer company -- had hoped to sell 100 million songs in the first year of its iTunes Music Store. Instead it sold 70 million songs. But nobody seems to be complaining. At 99 cents per song, iTunes has generated nearly $70 million in legal Internet music sales that didn't exist before, and it is hoping to double that figure in the second year. What makes the first year of iTunes remarkable isn't just the way it has created a powerful new market for legally downloading music. Apple's profits have begun to ride increasingly on the extraordinary success of its MP3 digital music players: the iPod, which has been around for several years, and the iPod mini, introduced earlier this year. Attractive as the iPod is, its usefulness was limited, before iTunes, by the extent of one's own music collection and one's appetite for downloading, which, besides generally being illegal, also meant poor sound quality. Adding music legally to an iPod meant buying a CD, transferring songs to your computer and then storing the files on the iPod. The iTunes Music Store does away with the physical CD and, in most cases, reduces the actual cost of buying music.
4/29/2004	Apple Sells 70 Million Songs In First Year of ITunes Service	Apple Computer said Wednesday that it had sold more than 70 million songs during the first year of its online iTunes music service. The company, which struck a landmark deal with record companies last year to permit iTunes users to download copyrighted music, had originally said it believed it would sell 100 million songs during the first year of the service.
4/26/2004	Technology and Show Business Kiss and Make Up	''Content is king,'' trumpeted Carleton S. Fiorina, the chairman and chief executive of the Hewlett-Packard Company, as she opened the National Association of Broadcasters convention last week in Las Vegas. The slogan was old, but still sweet to the entertainment community, which packed the show to hear her. The company tossed out technology goodies as well, like a new system that could sharply lower the costs of animation. Hewlett also announced plans to develop film restoration and post-production technology with Warner Brothers.
4/25/2004	Oh, Yeah, He Also Sells Computers	STROLL the corridors and the atriums on Apple Computer's corporate campus these days and you will notice that something is missing. Gone are the posters and graphics accenting the company's sleek personal computers. In their place, in the main lobby, is a striking, three-story-high billboard celebrating Steven P. Jobs's brand-new billion-dollar consumer electronics business -- the iPod digital MP3 music player. In just two and a half years, Mr. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, has managed to take a well-designed hand-held gadget, add software connecting it to Macintoshes and Windows-based personal computers and convince the recording industry that he has found an elegant solution for ending its nightmare of digital piracy. In doing so, he has shifted the emphasis of Apple from what made it famous -- hip, even lovable computers -- to what he hopes will keep it relevant and profitable in the future: products for a digital way of life.
4/22/2004	PC Mission: Big Value, Small Price	PRODUCTS that are tagged as ''high value'' or ''value-priced'' bring to mind things that are faded copies of something else, like store-brand sandwich cookies that don't taste like real Oreos or an imported $75 guitar that can't begin to approach the warmth and tone of a Martin steel-string wonder costing several thousand dollars. Sure, these lower-priced items may perform the same function as the big-ticket goods, but not nearly as well, nor for as long, before falling apart. So when I noticed the abundance of computers now being marketed as high-value options, I was wary, mentally picturing hamster-powered boxes wheezing up barely enough processing power to open the Google home page. But once I got my hands on some offerings from several major computer makers, I was pleasantly surprised.
4/19/2004	Infighting left Sony behind Apple in digital music. Can it come back?; Teaching an Old Walkman Some New Steps	Last July, while most people were taking summer vacations, the Sony Corporation of America made a little noticed, but crucial announcement. Jay Samit, a longtime music industry executive, was appointed general manager of Sony Connect, a new subsidiary that will sell songs online and allow consumers to play them on their Sony gadgets. His appointment was largely overlooked outside the company, but inside, the move was immediately understood as a way to unite the sometimes conflicting electronics and content divisions.
4/18/2004	600 Macs, 4,000 Lines, One Giant Leap for DVD's	ON the second floor of an unassuming office building on the edge of Burbank, John Lowry is forging what might be the future of the DVD -- and, with it, the way that classic films will be stored, preserved, telecast and watched. Mr. Lowry, who has worked for decades at enhancing video imagery, is responsible for some of the best-looking DVD restorations in recent years, including transfers of ''Casablanca,'' ''Singin' in the Rain'' and ''Once Upon a Time in the West.'' Since last November, he has been immersed in a project that promises to advance the state of the art -- and that has been kept secret, even among most industry insiders, until now.
4/15/2004	Profit at Apple Almost Triples On a Sharp Rise in IPod Sales	Apple Computer Inc. said Wednesday that its profits nearly tripled in its second quarter because of continued strong sales of the iPod portable music player and notebook computers. For the three months ended March 27, Apple reported a net profit of $46 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with $14 million, or 4 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue was $1.91 billion, a 29 percent increase from $1.48 billion.
4/15/2004	In a Sequel, File Making Made Easier	SOMEWHERE along the line, electronic databases started getting a bad name. Once word spread that our buying habits, Web explorations and video rentals were being tracked and recorded, the reputation of the computerized database somehow drifted from ''symbol of efficiency, accuracy, and a better tomorrow'' to ''Big Brother's best buddy.'' If databases were human, they'd hire an image consultant right about now. But if the only affairs you want to track are your own, a database is one of the most useful pieces of software. Many small-business owners, in particular, would be lost without some convenient way to track inventory, print invoices, maintain customer lists, tally billable hours, prepare expense reports and so on. And even at home, a true-blue database program is a much more flexible system for keeping track of CD collections, eBay auctions and even recipes than typing them all into Excel spreadsheets.
4/15/2004	RealNetworks Seeks Musical Alliance With Apple	RealNetworks made a direct appeal last week to Apple Computer, its Internet music rival, suggesting that the two companies form a common front against Microsoft in the digital music business. The offer to create a ''tactical alliance'' was made on April 9 by Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks, the Seattle-based Internet music and video service, in an e-mail message to Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chairman.
3/26/2004	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Postpones Ipod Mini's Foreign Release	Apple Computer said yesterday that it had postponed the overseas introduction of the smaller version of its iPod music player from April to July, citing unexpectedly strong demand in the United States since the product's beginnings last month. ''The iPod mini is a huge hit with customers in the U.S., and we're sure it will be the same worldwide once we can ramp up our supply in the July quarter,'' said Timothy D. Cook, Apple's executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations.
3/25/2004	A Choice of Kill or Be Killed, With Futuristic Firepower	With the latest versions of Doom and Half-Life still months away from store shelves, fans of the combat video games known as first-person shooters found relief for itchy trigger fingers when Unreal Tournament 2004 was released last week. Its publisher, Atari, declined to release sales figures, but retailers have reported selling more than 100,000 copies since the game was issued on March 16. A spokesman for the retailer GameStop said that it was already its best-selling PC game of the year. The suggested price is $39.99, and don't bother trying to play it on an antiquated PC. The Windows version requires at least a one-gigahertz processor, and 1.5 gigahertz is recommended.
3/21/2004	Musical Chairs With the Big Boys	IS RealNetworks the next Netscape? Rob Glaser, the founder and chief executive of RealNetworks, a pioneering maker of music-playing software for the Internet, bridles at the notion. ''Our situation is very different in some important ways,'' he said in a lengthy interview last week.
3/12/2004	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Jobs Paid $74.8 Million In Stock	Apple Computer paid its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, $74.8 million in restricted stock in the last fiscal year after the company replaced his unprofitable stock options. Mr. Jobs, 49, takes ownership of his five million restricted shares in two years. He received $1 in salary, as he has since returning to the company in 1997, and no bonus, Apple said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A three-year slide in Apple's stock price before last March made Mr. Jobs's 27.5 million options unprofitable. The company approved a plan last year to replace his options.
3/11/2004	Choose Your Weapon (And Soundtrack, Too)	Move over, Fountains of Wayne. The Vangor Dragons are available for play on the iPod, even though they do not sing a note. In the mold of Dungeons and Dragons and wordy role-playing computer games, XO Play has released a text-based adventure game called The Rise of the Lost for the iPod. A player assumes the role of Sir Jacob Zavier, a knight, to battle the evil Grand Wizard Sazque, keeper of the Vangor Dragons and master of the Org army.
3/4/2004	Apple Opens A Store, And It Clicks	LATELY, this has been a city of long, expectant lines. First came the throngs of same-sex couples outside City Hall, waiting to be married and to make history in the process. Then, last Saturday morning, came the Apple Computer faithful, waiting . . . well, waiting to see a store that is practically identical, in its sleek interior design, to the company's 75 other retail outlets around the country. For some Apple fanatics, apparently, the queue's the thing.
2/19/2004	In Defense of IPod Rivals	To the Editor: Re ''For IPod, 6 Flavors of Flattery'' (State of the Art, Feb. 12), a review of some high-capacity digital audio players:
2/19/2004	1,000 Gigabytes Appease The Multimedia Glutton	If hefty digital video files, thousands of MP3 songs and scads of JPEG images are crowding your computer's 30- or 40-gigabyte hard drive, you may want to ease the space crunch by supersizing your system with an external hard drive. There are plenty of big drives that can add a few hundred gigabytes of extra space. And then there is the LaCie Bigger Disk hard drive, which holds a full terabyte -- that's right, 1,000 gigabytes -- of data.
2/16/2004	Mix-Up Over Sale of 'Silence' Cleared Up With a Little Talk	The silence was broken. Now it is fixed. The experimental rock band Sonic Youth was surprised to find out last week that Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store was restricting the sale of one of its songs, a 63-second stretch of silence called ''Silence'', by allowing it to be downloaded only by people who bought the entire 1995 album on which it first appeared.
2/12/2004	For IPod, 6 Flavors Of Flattery	EVEN this early in the campaign, the battle for the popular vote is really heating up; the incumbent is being challenged by lesser-known candidates from all over the country. The winner will be the candidate with the best balance of new ideas and appealing looks -- and battery life. I am referring, of course, to the battle for supremacy among portable music players.
2/9/2004	MediaTalk; Downloaders Can Get Nothing for Something From Apple	The top-of-the-line iPod music player from Apple Computer can hold four solid weeks of music. But what if you just want a little peace and quiet? As it turns out, Apple sells that too -- sounds of silence for 99 cents. Steve Halberstadt of Raleigh, N.C., made such a purchase last week after discovering that Apple's iTunes store, the Web's leading downloadable music outlet, had added ''The Whitey Album,'' a 1995 release by Ciccone Youth, a jokey side project of the rock band Sonic Youth. The album's second track album, ''Silence,'' consists of 63 seconds of exactly that. (The band has said, with tongue in cheek, that the track is a version of John Cage's famous silent composition ''4'33'','' only speeded up.)
2/6/2004	Technology Briefing | People: Apple's Financial Chief To Retire	Fred D. Anderson, the chief financial officer of Apple Computer, plans to retire in June. Apple's controller, Peter Oppenheimer, 41, will succeed Mr. Anderson, Apple said yesterday. Mr. Anderson, 59, will join Apple's board after he retires. Apple had $592 million in cash -- enough for five weeks -- and $400 million in loans about to come due when Mr. Anderson, left, joined in March 1996. He helped cut the work force by almost half and made arrangements to pay off the loans. In the first quarter, which ended on Dec. 27, Apple reported $4.79 billion in cash and short-term investments and $302 million in short-term debt. Shares of Apple rose 63 cents, to $22.42.
2/5/2004	The IPod as Boombox With a Magical Bass	Apple iPod owners who want to share their sound, or simply take their headphones off, can plug their player into Altec Lansing's inMotion ultraportable audio system. Unfold the system, which is the size of a paperback, and you have a dock for the iPod flanked by a a pair of small speakers. When placed in the dock, the iPod can handle all the data transfers and synchronization that a standard, free-standing iPod dock does; the dock can also charge any iPod with a docking connector. (Although it won't recharge them, the inMotion system also works with older iPods with a FireWire port, but not the new Mini.) Available exclusively through Apple stores, including www.store.apple.com, the $149 system can play for up to 24 hours on four AA batteries, thanks to a high-efficiency switching amplifier that delivers two watts to each speaker.
1/26/2004	Online Music Industry Is Focusing on Europe	Europe is the next battlefield for portable digital music, with its eager consumer market and attractive demographics, but complex cross-border legal and financial obstacles are delaying the entry of the biggest names, including Apple Computer. Still, the online music industry is hungry for the European market, according to many executives at an international music conference that started here on Saturday, and it is preparing to take on the established European leader, On Demand Distribution, a company co-founded by the musician Peter Gabriel that is known as OD2 and powers most existing music services in Europe.
1/22/2004	Now Playing on Your iPod, Words You'll Never Forget	Most iPod owners use the device mainly for entertainment. With an accessory from Griffin Technology called iTalk, however, the music player can also be put to work as a voice recorder. The iTalk plugs into any iPod except the new Mini. It contains a microphone, an outlet for an external microphone and a tiny speaker.
1/19/2004	New Economy; Apple's success with iPod may presage the ascendance of hardware over software.	LEAVE it to Steven P. Jobs to sell the razors and give away the blades. Common Silicon Valley wisdom has hewed for decades to the business adage that to establish a successful business in consumer products, you must be willing to lose money on the razors and look for profits from selling the blades. A notable example has been Microsoft's money-losing Xbox video game business. By hemorrhaging money on each video game console (razor) sold and hoping someday to make it up on game software (razor blades), Microsoft's home and entertainment division reported losses of almost $1 billion last year.
1/15/2004	Apple Exceeds Expectations for Quarter	Driven by strong sales of the iPod digital music player, portable computers and a new version of the OS X operating system, Apple Computer exceeded Wall Street expectations in its first quarter. For the three months that ended Dec. 27, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported a net profit of $63 million or 17 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $8 million or 2 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had projected earnings of 15 cents a share on revenue of $1.9 billion.
1/15/2004	Recording Studio In a Box	SINCE Steve Jobs's return to Apple in 1997, the company's most important new products have all begun with the letter i. There was the iPod, of course, and the iMac, and groundbreaking programs like iPhoto (for digital photos), iMovie (for camcorder video), iTunes (for organizing music) and iDVD (for creating homemade DVD's). In every case, Apple's goal was obvious: to create products so simple and creative that people would say, ''iWant, iLove, iBuy.'' At the Macworld Expo in San Francisco last week, Apple unveiled a new version of its ''i'' software suite, now called iLife '04. Because it's on the biggish side (several gigabytes in all), it will no longer be a free download. You'll have to buy it for $50 or get it preinstalled on a new Macintosh.
1/12/2004	Power Players	People watching the online music industry say two things about that digital marketplace: business is booming, and the business stinks. Dozens of companies have opened online music stores, drawn by the promise of riches if even a fraction of the tens of millions of people illegally downloading songs turn to legitimate services. But profits in selling songs are slim at best, and the industry is already too crowded. ''There are about three times as many music stores as there need to be,'' said Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester Research.
1/9/2004	Hewlett Joins With Apple In Music Deal	Hewlett-Packard said Thursday that it would begin selling a version of Apple Computer's iPod digital music player and bundling Apple's iTunes online music store with its personal computers in a new partnership that points to a major realignment of forces within the computer industry. The agreement -- which was completed only after an extensive bargaining session that ran long into Wednesday night between Carleton S. Fiorina, Hewlett's chief executive, and Apple's Steven P. Jobs -- represents a significant departure for both companies. For the first time, Mr. Jobs has stepped away from the self-enclosed Apple-only strategy he has pursued since he returned to run the company in 1997. Meanwhile, Hewlett, the second-largest computer maker in the world, has put its software partner, Microsoft, on notice that it will not necessarily follow its lead in every case.
1/8/2004	Lots of Players, Little Harmony	BRETT RENWICK, an enterprising refugee from the dot-com implosion, considers himself an especially tech-savvy consumer. He spent weeks poring over reviews and product specifications before deciding on a high-speed Internet service for his Harlem apartment. And he is studying the pros and cons of plasma, liquid crystal and digital light processing as he wrestles with finding a television ready for high-definition viewing. But when it comes to shopping for a digital music player, he huffs and throws up his hands.
1/8/2004	Retreating From Dial-Up Business, Microsoft Aims MSN.com at Yahoo	Microsoft said yesterday that it was repositioning its money-losing MSN Internet service operation to compete more directly with Yahoo's personalized Web portal and America Online's broadband premium service. At the same time, it is planning a new MSN premium service, priced at $9.95 monthly and modeled after Apple Computer's .Mac Internet-based customer support service.
1/8/2004	Sequel; The IPod's Little Brother Makes a Big Splash	Apple's Macintosh may have only 5 percent of the computer market, but its music players are flying high. At his opening address at the Macworld Expo here on Tuesday, Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, cited impressive market-share figures for the iPod music player (31 percent) and for the iTunes Music Store, Apple's dollar-a-song download service (70 percent).
1/7/2004	Apple Introduces a Smaller, Less Expensive IPod	Apple Computer introduced on Tuesday a smaller, slightly less expensive version of its iPod digital music players for $249 and a more powerful $3,000 to $4,000 server computer based on its new G5 microprocessor. The announcements were made by Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, on the opening day of the Macworld exhibition, which will continue here through Friday. They were less dramatic than the company's usual introductions aimed at wowing customers with innovative technologies and new product lines at this regularly scheduled event.
1/3/2004	In One Suburb, Asian-Americans Gain a Firm Political Foothold	Those seeking visions of the new Cupertino do not have to look far. It may be found in the neat rows of shoes on front doorsteps, in the tanks of live seafood at the Tin Tin supermarket, or the shopping malls bristling with signs in Mandarin. But perhaps the most potent symbol of the transformation of this sprawling Silicon Valley suburb may be found at the Joy Luck Place in the Cupertino Village shopping center, where members of the city's Asian-born power elite strike deals over dim sum and tea in a new twist on the smoky backroom.
1/1/2004	For the Ex-Buccaneer, A Pillage-Free Playlist	IT was time for the Schwartzes to go legit. No more pirated music for us. Of course, I am not talking about songs like ''A Pirate's Life For Me'' (We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot/Drink up me 'earties, yo ho!), but about the latter-day practice that its title suggests. I'm talking about copyright infringement, an international pastime enjoyed by millions thanks to file-trading services like Kazaa.
12/19/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Wal-Mart Offers Online Music	Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer and a top seller of compact discs, began offering music yesterday for customers to download from its Web site for 88 cents a song, a price that undercuts those of online competitors like Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store. Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., said it planned to gather customer feedback from the site in the next few months, make changes, and ''officially launch the service'' next spring. The service, called Music Downloads, is available at www.walmart.com. Competitors, including iTunes and Napster, offer song downloads for 99 cents. The move mimics Wal-Mart's entry into the business of renting DVD's by mail, when it cut prices to draw customers away from rivals like Netflix. Wal-Mart is seeking a foothold in online music as downloading is blamed for the declining sales of CD's. Global music sales fell 11 percent, to $12.7 billion, in the first half of this year, after declining 7 percent last year and 6 percent in 2001, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group. Shares of Wal-Mart rose 70 cents, to $52.60. The market for legally downloaded music will be $35 million this year, a fraction of annual music sales, said David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Research, a technology research firm. He estimates that online music sales will increase to more than $100 million next year and approach $700 million by 2008.
11/30/2003	The Guts of a New Machine	Two years ago this month, Apple Computer released a small, sleek-looking device it called the iPod. A digital music player, it weighed just 6.5 ounces and held about 1,000 songs. There were small MP3 players around at the time, and there were players that could hold a lot of music. But if the crucial equation is ''largest number of songs'' divided by ''smallest physical space,'' the iPod seemed untouchable. And yet the initial reaction was mixed: the thing cost $400, so much more than existing digital players that it prompted one online skeptic to suggest that the name might be an acronym for ''Idiots Price Our Devices.'' This line of complaint called to mind the Newton, Apple's pen-based personal organizer that was ahead of its time but carried a bloated price tag to its doom. Since then, however, about 1.4 million iPods have been sold. (It has been updated twice and now comes in three versions, all of which improved on the original's songs-per-space ratio, and are priced at $300, $400 and $500, the most expensive holding 10,000 songs.) For the months of July and August, the iPod claimed the No. 1 spot in the MP3 player market both in terms of unit share (31 percent) and revenue share (56 percent), by Apple's reckoning. It is now Apple's highest-volume product. ''It's something that's as big a brand to Apple as the Mac,'' is how Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, puts it. ''And that's a pretty big deal.''
11/24/2003	Bronfman Heir Plotting His Comeback, in Music	For the last three years, Edgar Bronfman Jr. has lived in the shadow of a monumentally bad decision. He sold his family's Seagram liquor empire for shares of Vivendi, a French utility-turned-media company, only to watch it nearly collapse and take with it his family's fortune. But today, Mr. Bronfman and a group of investors led by Thomas H. Lee Partners are expected to announce an agreement to buy Warner Music, home to Madonna and R.E.M. among many others, from Time Warner for $2.6 billion, people involved in the deal said yesterday. Mr. Bronfman, a onetime songwriter for Celine Dion and others, will become the company's top executive.
11/16/2003	PAGE TWO: THE READING FILE	Taking the Dj Vu View Of the Occupation in Iraq IN 1945, Allen W. Dulles, the head of the Office of Strategic Services, gave a briefing on the German occupation. In its latest issue, Foreign Affairs magazine reprinted what Dulles said, noting that the Truman administration had ''little clue'' how its occupation would turn out. Excerpts follow:
11/6/2003	Rewarding Apple Loyalty	To the Editor: ''Apple's Latest 0.1 Adds a Lot'' (State of the Art, Oct. 23), about the 10.3 version of the Mac OS X operating system, known as Panther, hits the nail on the head when it asks whether devoted Apple users are frustrated by having to pay $130 for a new upgrade every year. As a proud 17-year Macintosh user who has never owned a Windows machine (nor wanted to), I constantly brag about the distinct advantages of Apple computers and the Mac operating system to anyone who will listen. But Apple alienates users like me when it doesn't give us any break on pricing over first-time users who are just discovering Apple, or overly cautious Apple users who have yet to convert from version 9, even though OS X was introduced three years ago.
10/30/2003	Paying the Piper, Round 2: The Repertory Grows	IT'S the wacky parlor game that's sweeping the country: Design That Business Model! You're a recording-industry executive. You believe that those crazy kids, with their long music and loud hair, are eating into your profits by swapping digital music files online. Your goal is to design a music downloading service that they can use instead -- but this time, one that they'll pay for.
10/23/2003	Apple's Latest 0.1 Adds a Lot	THE reputation of the personal computer has taken a horrible hit this year. Viruses have made headlines week after week. Spam now exceeds 50 percent of all e-mail. Hackers and academics have uncovered one Windows security hole after another, turning Microsoft into a frantic little Dutch boy at the dike without enough fingers. If the computer industry were a celebrity, it would hire an image consultant. Correction: The Windows computer industry would hire one. Macintosh fans, on the other hand, have watched the tribulations of the much larger Windows population with mixed feelings -- sympathy, relief, even amusement -- because their operating system, Mac OS X, is so far 100 percent virus-free. And because Mac OS X comes with less of its plumbing exposed to the Internet than Windows, hackers are a far more distant worry.
10/22/2003	Low-Cost Supercomputer Put Together From 1,100 PC's	A home-brew supercomputer, assembled from off-the-shelf personal computers in just one month at a cost of slightly more than $5 million, is about to be ranked as one of the fastest machines in the world. Word of the low-cost supercomputer, put together by faculty, technicians and students at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, is shaking up the esoteric world of high performance computing, where the fastest machines have traditionally cost from $100 million to $250 million and taken several years to build.
10/17/2003	With Flair, Apple Extends Its Reach Into Online Music	Striking an alliance with America Online and a promotional agreement with PepsiCo, Apple Computer introduced its iTunes software for Windows computers on Thursday in an effort to capture a larger share of the market for downloading digital music. The announcement was the clearest statement yet by Apple that it is moving to make its distinctive brand play a vital role not just in computers but in the broader world of entertainment and mass-market consumer products as well.
10/16/2003	Apple Reports $44 Million Profit for the Quarter	Apple Computer reported on Wednesday fourth-quarter results that exceeded analysts' estimates. Those results were driven by a surge in sales of the iPod music player and Apple's newest generation of desktop computers. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said that its 63 retail stores were profitable for the quarter -- a first since Apple opened the chain in 2001.
10/16/2003	Accessories; Finishing Touches For the 'Pod	Apple Computer's technical support for the makers of accessories for its popular iPod music player has led to the creation of dozens of compatible products. Protective cases can be found in a variety of materials, including rubberized fabric ($19 to $30) and leather ($32 to $70) as well as soft transparent plastic (MaClear Zip Clear Case for iPod, $12.50, online specialty stores) or even aluminum (Matias's iPod Armor; www.halfkeyboard.com/ipodarmor, $40 to $46).
10/12/2003	What Price Music?	Since the introduction of vinyl records after World War II, recorded music has assumed many shapes and sizes, each one coming with a higher price tag than the last. Eight-track tapes cost a dollar more than LP's when they rose to popularity in the early 1970's, and cassettes commanded a premium over eight-tracks. And when CD's made their debut in the mid-1980's, record labels sold the shiny discs for $18, more than double the price for the same music on LP's and cassettes that cost more to manufacture. Unlike those formats, which the industry adopted voluntarily and marketed vigorously, the latest shift-- to digitized versions of songs that can be distributed online-- have been thrust upon it, the outgrowth of a technology it could not control. Battered by a sales slump it attributes largely to digital piracy and heartened by a limited test with Apple computer owners, this fall the record industry is trying to catch up with its file-swapping customers: the major labels and many independents have agreed to deconstruct the album, allowing anyone with a computer to buy any of hundreds of thousands of individual songs. Soon huge catalogs of every genre of music will be available for sale on the Internet from over a dozen retailers, bearing the blessing and license agreements of the major record labels. No one knows what all the effects will be. But one will certainly be on price; music in the new format will cost at least a little less than it did in the old. The standard charge has become 99 cents a track. Albums that cost between $12 and $18 on CD now sell for about $10 online. The labels have also authorized several services to offer a kind of online lease program for music: subscribers pay a flat $10 a month to listen to as many as half a million tracks as often as they want over the Internet, rather than storing them on a computer or burning them to a CD.
10/2/2003	Parking-Lot Etiquette For the Wireless Keyboard	Some wireless devices are like rude houseguests, always interfering with other gadgets under the same roof. But Apple's new cordless keyboard and mouse are models of decorum, discreetly taking the measure of their environment and bending over backward not to get in the way. The keyboard and mouse work on the Blue-tooth wireless standard, which uses the 2.4 gigahertz frequency, the same part of the radio spectrum employed by networked computers using the 802.11b standard, known as Wi-Fi. Bluetooth constantly hops among 79 channels, ostensibly to avoid interference. But problems can occur when it hops onto a channel claimed by Wi-Fi.
10/2/2003	For the Stylish MP3 Player, A Sleek Protective Sleeve	The iPod from Apple Computer is a designer music player, and with the least expensive model running about $300, it has a designer price tag. To protect the player's sleek, scratchable exterior and the miniature hard-drive technology inside, Terforma has released a new case called the iSleeve. Made of molded rubber, the iSleeve has no flaps, snaps or zippers to get in the way of the player's main control panel and display screen. The case's raised edges and rounded corners protect all sides of the player while a slit at the top exposes the iPod's headphones jack and hold switch. The iSleeve is also designed to work with iPods that use the iTrip FM transmitter from Griffin Technology to broadcast music through nearby radios in the car or home.
9/18/2003	First Aid; For a Creaky Mac, Tricks to Jog the Memory	LIKE Windows-based PC's, Macintosh computers -- at least those using the OS 9 operating system or earlier versions -- can be afflicted by memory malaise. Antidotes for the Mac can be tricky, though, depending on which operating system is involved. In most Macs running OS 9 or earlier, a predetermined amount of physical and virtual memory is allocated to software applications, said Mark Samis, a technical consultant with the Board of Cooperative Education Services, which provides technical services for school districts in New York State. He pointed out that OS 7, OS 8 and OS 9 have a utility that can manage virtual memory. ''It is a real pain, but you usually can get it to fix the problem,'' he said.
9/14/2003	Business People; Don't Disturb the Boss. He's Cruisin' on a Harley.	More truckers are becoming techies, according to the Atlas World Group, which last week released a survey of its 3,200 drivers. It showed that 95 percent of them use cellphones on the road, compared with just 62 percent who use CB radios, while nearly a quarter take along laptops. The company's biggest techno-geek may be its chief executive, Michael L. Shaffer, who recently plugged his Apple iPod into his 1998 Harley Davidson Road King Classic on a four-day road trip from Arizona to Washington, D.C. As Mr. Shaffer roared through the countryside with a gang of fellow motorcycle enthusiasts, he said, he hummed along with the iPod to rock tunes by the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan.
9/11/2003	Within a Lilliputian Player, a Hefty Archive That Travels	IT seems so simple: You push the Play button and you get an earful of Missy Elliott, Daniel Barenboim or whatever your musical whim. Unlike portable cassette or CD players, svelte digital audio jukeboxes like the silvery Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen or that sassy little white Apple iPod do not require swapping tapes or discs. Your entire digital music collection is on the device in the form of computer-encoded files in MP3, AAC, WMA or any of the other formats belonging to the alphabet soup of digital audio. You may have thousands of songs in your pocket, but do you really know where they live? Or what really goes on inside the jukebox as you scroll up your playlist or search frantically for that one song you positively must hear right this instant?
8/18/2003	New Economy; How an extra 32 bits can make all the difference for computer users.	APPLE COMPUTER has recently received much applause for its iTunes music service. But its new Power Mac G5 computers, set to arrive in stores today, will probably have a much larger impact on the world of personal computing. Apple already has 100,000 orders for its G5 machines, which are priced at $2,000 to $3,000, depending on the configuration. The breakthrough is that the computers use 64-bit microprocessors, a significant step beyond the 32-bit processors on current Apple machines and most Windows-based PC's.
7/28/2003	Out of the U.S. And Out of Luck To Download Music Legally	Online music-selling services have far fewer restrictions than the industry's early offerings, but they do not necessarily travel well. That became evident on Friday, after an Apple iTunes customer posted a complaint on the Web log of Declan McCullagh, who covers technology for CNet's News.com, and the discussion list of David J. Farber, a business and technology professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
7/17/2003	Apple Posts Decline in Profit, but Its Sales Rise	Apple Computer posted a sharp decline in profit for the quarter yesterday, but said that sales rose as it expanded its reach into laptops and music players. Net income fell 41 percent, to $19 million, or 5 cents a share, in its third quarter, down from $32 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 8 percent, to $1.55 billion, the highest in 11 quarters.
6/26/2003	Online Chat With Faces Attached	INSTANT messaging certainly has its charms. You and a conversation partner on the Internet type back and forth in a narrow window, your quips scrolling up the screen like a hastily written script. The fact that you can't see or hear the other person is either the best feature or the worst, depending on how self-conscious you are and how your hair looks. Better start combing. Last week both Microsoft and Apple incorporated audio and video into their popular chat programs, now called MSN Messenger 6 and iChat AV. You can download them free at messenger.msn.com or apple.com/ichat, respectively, as part of a public beta test -- a software company's way of saying, ''Sure they're buggy, but what do you want for free?''
6/24/2003	Apple Announces Chip Deal and Other Moves to Lift PC's	Steven Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer, unveiled a new alliance with I.B.M. today that will install a powerful I.B.M.-designed 64-bit microprocessor chip on Apple computers. The move is a bid to stay innovative and independent in a computing world dominated by Microsoft and Intel. The introduction of the new G5 chip, industry analysts said, is crucial to keeping Apple competitive with the ubiquitous Intel Pentium-based personal computers and to jump-start sales of Apple's Macintosh personal computers, which have been relatively flat the last two years.
6/15/2003	Adventures in Downloading Haydn	CLASSICAL music critics seldom get to feel that they're on track with a hip new product. So I came to iTunes with an extra sense of empowerment. ITunes, if you missed it, is the new music service from Apple that allows users to buy and legally download songs from a huge range of licensed albums. In the first week after it opened, in late April, the service sold a million music tracks. Finally, someone had figured out how to make money selling music on the Internet. And there I was with a new PowerBook, able to cruise iTunes' offerings of everything from rock to, yes, classical music. I felt ahead of the curve in another way: I knew the terrain. For nine months in 2000, I was the classical music editor of a Web site that sold music, legally, on the Internet, Musicmaker.com. In some ways it was a lot like iTunes, down to some of the same music, including large chunks of EMI's classical catalog. Like my PowerBook, Musicmaker helped me feel like a child of my own generation: it allowed me to share with my peers the experience of working for a failed dot-com.
6/12/2003	An Ergonomic Keyboard Has Typists Floating on Air	Unlike owners of desktop computers, laptop users are generally stuck with the keyboard supplied by the manufacturer. Owners of some laptops made by Apple, however, now have a choice. The TouchStream MacNTouch keyboard from FingerWorks not only rearranges the keys into what the company claims is a more ergonomic layout, but also allows users to direct the cursor and enter commands with hand gestures. Unlike regular keys, the ones on the MacNTouch keyboard are not pressed. The keys function by measuring the disruptions caused by hand movements to a small electromagnetic field above the keyboard.
6/8/2003	In Fight Over Online Music, Industry Now Offers a Carrot	Like a lot of music fans roaming the Internet these days, David Bishop registers one basic sentiment when he thinks about the record industry. ''They're a bunch of greedheads,'' he says. ''They've been really fat on what I think of as huge profits and now they're trying to maintain the status quo.'' Mr. Bishop is not your typical college-dormitory Internet pirate. A 49-year-old illustrator in San Rafael, Calif., he has steered scrupulously clear of file-sharing software like Napster and KaZaA. But he recently discovered how to play the music provided by other online fans without copying it, and has no compunction about flouting recent efforts to stamp out the practice.
6/7/2003	Editorial Observer; Downloading Music Over the Internet Without Feeling Like a Criminal	Hardly a week goes by without another salvo in the music wars, which have been going on now for years. And week by week the shape of the struggle seems to change. What set it all off was the emergence in 1999 of Napster, the file-swapping brainstorm that allowed computer users to download free music files. Napster was enormously destabilizing. It undermined the economic logic of $17.99 CD's by making the physical object itself, the CD in its jewel case, irrelevant. The recording industry knew exactly what to make of Napster, calling it theft, plain and simple. Recording artists had a harder time. Many musicians agreed that file swapping was a form of theft, but many of them also argued that their recording contracts were a form of theft, too. At the very least, file swapping became the perfect industry excuse for the prolonged downturn in CD sales, whether it was the real cause or not.
6/5/2003	Father of the iMac Wins Designer of the Year Prize	The British public helped elect Jonathan Ive, above, as the Design Museum of London's first designer of the year. Mr. Ive, the vice president of industrial design at Apple Computers and the father of the iMac, left, was awarded $40,000. Alice Rawsthorn, director of the museum, helped select the nominees, all born or based in Britain. The others were the jewelry designer Solange Azagury-Partridge; the designer Tord Boontje; and Rockstar Games, which designed the Grand Theft Auto video game. ''It was complicated to know what criteria to use,'' said the fashion designer Paul Smith, who was on the jury, along with the Australian designer Marc Newson; Paola Antonelli, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art; and Emily King, a design historian. A show on the finalists is at the Design Museum through June 29; www.designmuseum.org. CHEE PEARLMAN
5/21/2003	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple To Open 20 Retail Stores	Apple Computer will increase the number of its retail stores 35 percent over the next year by opening 19 more in the United States and one in Tokyo, its first overseas. Apple, which opened its first shop two years ago and now has 57 stores in the United States, said last month that it would have about 70 stores open by the end of 2003. Apple's chief executive, Steve Jobs, has been looking for ways to increase revenue as demand for personal computers has been in a slump for more than two years. After Apple lost market share to rivals that used the Windows operating system, which is owned by Microsoft, the company opened the stores as a way of attracting new users to its Macintosh personal computers. The stores have generated more than $650 million in sales since May 2001, Apple said. Apple shares declined 31 cents, to $17.79.
5/19/2003	Music Songs  la Carte	Apple Computer said last week that its Music Store, the recent addition to the music download services on the Internet, had sold more than two million songs since the store's debut on April 28. The service offers more than 200,000 song titles from major music companies for 99 cents each. The Apple store joins other music download sites that include Pressplay, MusicNow and MusicNet.
5/12/2003	Compressed Data; Apple Tweaks Microsoft Over a New Computer	A few years ago, when Steve Jobs introduced Apple's popular iMac computer, his archrival, Bill Gates, groused that Apple had reduced innovation in the personal computing world to translucent colored plastics. ''The one thing Apple's providing now is leadership in colors,'' Mr. Gates, the head of Microsoft, said at a conference for financial analysts at the time, News.com said. ''It won't take long for us to catch up with that, I don't think.''
5/8/2003	A Hit Single for $1	To the Editor: Re ''Online Piper, Payable by the Tune'' (State of the Art, May 1), about Apple's new on-line music service:
5/1/2003	Online Piper, Payable By the Tune	EVERY so often some gifted thinker stares at a long-entrenched product or tradition, and with sudden inspiration redesigns it and changes the world for the better. Thanks to these little moments of brilliance, society now takes for granted such advances as self-adhesive postage stamps, seedless watermelon and waxed dental floss. In 1984, Steve Jobs, Apple Computer's co-founder, pulled off just such a stunt with the Macintosh, whose icons and menus banished the cryptic commands of DOS to the great computer museum in the sky.
4/29/2003	Apple Offers Music Downloads With Unique Pricing	Apple Computer unveiled its online music store today in a move that both the company and the record industry hope will be the beginning of a lucrative and legal partnership for downloading popular music. The new service stands in contrast to both the free music swapping services that have proliferated on the Internet and the record industry's own initial efforts to develop a method for downloading songs to computers, which generally require consumers to subscribe to a service.
4/28/2003	Apple Is Said To Be Entering E-Music Fray With Pay Service	Apple Computer plans on Monday to introduce a digital music service, according to industry analysts. It is a move that thrusts the company into the middle of a contentious and technologically challenging area of digital commerce. Apple itself has provided few details of its new service, but people in the music industry and analysts said users would be charged 99 cents to download individual songs drawn from the catalogs of the big record labels. They said that once users download the music, they would be able to listen to it on their computers or transfer it to a portable music player.
4/12/2003	Apple Said to Discuss a Music Deal, but Not Too Seriously	Apple, the iconoclastic computer maker, has discussed an investment in Universal Music, the world's largest recording company, people close to the discussions said yesterday. These people, however, also cautioned that a deal was unlikely to be concluded. Universal Music is among the American entertainment assets that its parent, Vivendi Universal of France, is considering selling as it tries to pare down a huge debt. Potential suitors were seen as coming from an investor or player in entertainment. But Apple's interest came out of the blue.
3/21/2003	APPLE CHIEF TO SWAP OUT OF 22.5 MILLION STOCK OPTIONS	The chief executive of Apple Computer, Steven P. Jobs, will give up 22.5 million stock options after the company's board approved a plan to retire options made worthless by a drop in the stock's price. Mr. Jobs will exchange 27.5 million options for 5 million new ones that will allow him to buy shares in three years. The old options required Mr. Jobs to pay more for the shares than he would on the open market, a spokeswoman said. Apple's directors also voted on Wednesday to allow employees outside management to exchange current stock options for new ones.
3/20/2003	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Gore Elected To Apple Computer Board	Apple Computer Inc., the maker of iMac personal computers, elected former Vice President Al Gore to its board yesterday. Mr. Gore, a Mac user, helped popularize the term ''information superhighway'' and fought to get federal funds to help build what became the Internet, Apple said in a statement. Apple has added new products like a 17-inch laptop and cut prices for existing models as it copes with a slump in PC demand.
3/20/2003	A Vintage Palmtop Holds Users in Thrall	WHEN Victor Rehorst pulls out his oversize personal digital assistant, there is often someone with a question. ''They usually ask, what kind of a Palm is that?'' Mr. Rehorst said. The answer is that Mr. Rehorst's computer is not a Palm at all. Mr. Rehorst, 22, who works in the information technology department of a bank in Toronto, is among the enthusiasts who continue to use the Apple Newton, a hand-held that was abandoned by its manufacturer just over five years ago.
2/20/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft To Buy Some Assets Of Connectix	Microsoft said late yesterday that it would purchase some of the assets of the Connectix Corporation, a small maker of so-called virtual machine software, based in San Mateo, Calif. The deal includes the company's flagship product, Virtual PC, which permits Macintosh users to run applications written for Microsoft Windows and Intel-based personal computers. Virtual PC software is crucial for Apple Computer because it permits corporate users to run Windows-based applications that do not exist for the Macintosh. Of greater interest to Microsoft, Connectix has developed a similar product for Windows-based PC's that permits computer users to run multiple operating systems, including Linux, simultaneously. The Silicon Valley company also recently entered the market for server computers used by corporations. The software permits a single Intel computer to simultaneously run a variety of operating systems, including Windows 2000 Server, Unix and Linux. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. John Markoff (NYT)
2/17/2003	Microsoft Loosens Apple's Hold on Schools	Apple Computer, formerly the undisputed leader in sales of personal computers to schools, has steadily lost ground over the years to lower-priced PC's that run Microsoft Windows software. And these days the company faces another threat in the education market: a proposed class-action legal settlement by Microsoft that could result in the donation of hundreds of millions of dollars of Microsoft software to needy schools throughout California. Under the deal proposed last month, Microsoft would offer more than $1 billion in vouchers, ranging in price from $5 to $29, for technology from Microsoft and its competitors to California consumers who bought Windows, Office and other Microsoft products from 1995 to 2001.
1/30/2003	Movies or Music Files? A Jukebox Does Double Duty	First there was audio and then there was video. As television followed radio, the personal jukebox, once a mere music player, has progressed from spinning out MP3 tunes to playing video clips. The Archos Multimedia Jukebox 20 comes with a color liquid crystal display screen right on the front to display digital photographs and play video clips in the MPEG-4 format. The Multimedia Jukebox 20, which has a built-in microphone and ports for stereo inputs, can both play and record MP3 files. Its rechargeable battery can play up to seven hours of music between charges. Its color screen, which measures 237 by 234 pixels, can display photographs in the JPEG and BMP formats. The unit can also be connected to a television set for viewing the stored pictures on the big screen.
1/16/2003	Apple Posts Loss on Weaker-Than-Expected Revenue	Apple Computer reported yesterday that it lost money in its fiscal first quarter, ended in December, on revenues that were slightly weaker than analysts' expectations. Apple executives said business conditions would probably remain difficult in the current quarter, expecting a ''slight profit'' with revenues about the same level as in the December quarter.
1/9/2003	A Microsoft Watch Will Provide Much More Than Time	Microsoft, continuing its effort to extend its reach beyond computers, today introduced designs for a new class of watch that gives more than the time and a pocket audio and video player. The designs, which will be available from several manufacturers by the end of the year, were presented by Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, in a speech today that opened the annual International Consumer Electronics Show here.
1/8/2003	Apple Branches Out, Offering 2 Software Programs	Five years after returning to lead Apple Computer, Steven P. Jobs introduced software today in areas that others had long since ceded to Microsoft: a free Web browser tailored for the Macintosh and a $99 program for making elaborate business presentations. Microsoft's Internet Explorer dominates the Web browser market, even on the Macintosh, and its PowerPoint software holds virtually all of the presentation software market. Neither of those positions is likely to be jeopardized quickly by the announcements today.
1/6/2003	Apple May Plan Computer Chameleon to Reflect Owners' Whims	Apple Computer is known for its splashy computer designs, and there has been a notable buzz among the Macintosh faithful since the the Patent and Trademark Office's Web site published an Apple patent application several weeks ago. The company's United States patent application, No. 20030002246, entitled ''active enclosure for a computing device,'' describes a machine that contains an array of rainbow-hued light-emitting diodes. It seems that the quirky computer maker is considering the manufacture of a machine that acts something like a mood ring -- a computer whose shells change colors at the owner's whim.
1/2/2003	Embracing New Languages	To the Editor: ''For Foreign Language Learners, the Web Unties Tongues'' (Dec. 19) implies that some foreign-language-based communicative acts can be accomplished only on a Windows computer.
12/5/2002	Homemade, but It Looks Like Hollywood	SO you have a digital video camera, a computer and the creative urge. Where do you go from here to turn your video into a slick, professional-looking production on a DVD or a video CD, complete with title screens, fancy scene transitions, rolling credits and a personalized soundtrack? After some research, I found that I needed four things on the hardware side for smooth production: several gigabytes of spare hard-drive space, at least a Pentium III, 500-megahertz processor (or at least Macintosh's 300-megahertz G3 or later processor), a minimum of 128 megabytes of RAM and a FireWire port on the computer. On the software side, I needed a video-editing program.
11/25/2002	Compressed Data; Apple's Quirky Ads Evoke Parodies of Themselves	Apple Computer's quirky ads have never been as good at building market share as ''mind share,'' or buzz. The current campaign, with Macintosh users talking of why they switched from the Microsoft Windows world to Apple products, has received so much attention that imitations and parodies are showing up across the Web. Many of the fake ads use the same distinctive plinky-twangy music and stark white background of the originals. The site Macboy.com, for one, offers brief cartoons with such unlikely Apple switchers as Bill Gates and the ubiquitous ''Steve'' from Dell Computer's ad campaign. (''My name is Steve, and, dude, I'm getting a Mac.'')
11/21/2002	Upgrade a Mac Instead	To the Editor: Re ''The Old Computer: Upgrade or Retire?'' (Basics, Nov. 14): The headline should have been ''The Old PC: Upgrade or Retire?'' I use and maintain both PC's and Macs, and when I upgrade one of my Macs, I allow an hour and rarely need more. For PC's, I have learned through bitter experience to schedule a day or two.
11/18/2002	Businesses, Big and Small, Bet on Wireless Internet Access	From a rooftop overlooking hundreds of failed dot-com businesses in the South of Market district here, an inelegant picture-frame sized antenna is now radiating the Internet over a 20-block area. There are some here who think that the antenna, a wireless Internet-access transmitter and receiver, represents the next big thing.
11/14/2002	A Heavy Lifter for the Move From Windows to Mac	Packing up and moving all your things from one place to another can be stressful, whether the destination is a new house or a new computer, and a cross-platform move may even seem more daunting than a cross-country relocation. For those who are jumping from a Windows machine to a new Macintosh computer, the new Move2Mac kit from Detto Technologies can make transferring files quicker and easier than copying them all onto Zip disks or burning a stack of CD's. Move2Mac includes a special U.S.B. cable and software that can move photos, documents, spreadsheets, folders and music files between machines. Address book, database files, Internet Explorer favorites and certain system settings can also be transferred from PC to Mac, and it takes about 15 minutes to move 500 megabytes of data.
11/7/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Cuts Price Of Ibook Laptops	Apple Computer yesterday lowered the price of iBook laptop computers by as much as 17 percent and added faster processors to the machines, ahead of what may be the worst holiday shopping season in a decade. The personal-computer maker knocked $200 off the price of three iBook models, which now range from $999 to $1,599, and added PowerPC G3 chips that run at speeds of up to 800 megahertz. It also upgraded its Titanium PowerBook G4 computers, which play and copy compact discs and DVD's, Apple said. Last month, Apple forecast a slight sales increase for the holiday season, seeing no sign that an industrywide slump in PC sales would soon be reversed. Shipments of Macintosh computers fell 14 percent in the quarter ended in September, leaving Apple with only its second quarterly loss since the chief executive, Steve Jobs, regained control of the company more than five years ago. Apple shares rose 32 cents, to $17.22.
10/17/2002	Uncertainty in PC Industry Keeps Apple Earnings Flat	Fighting off a deepening technology recession, Apple Computer reported essentially flat revenue today for its fourth quarter of 2002. But a one-time write-down of investments resulted in a net loss for the quarter. Apple said it expected only a slight increase in revenue for its next quarter, which includes the holiday sales season.
9/21/2002	ORACLE EXECUTIVE QUITS AS A DIRECTOR OF APPLE COMPUTER	The billionaire software executive Lawrence J. Ellison, whose Oracle Corporation has had six straight quarters of falling sales, quit as a director of Apple Computer after five years that included bringing back Steven P. Jobs to lead a turnaround. ''He just didn't have time to come to the board meetings,'' Mr. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said in an e-mail message. Company filings show Mr. Ellison missed at least a quarter of Apple's meetings. Mr. Ellison is trying to reverse Oracle's sales slump, which has contributed to an 83 percent plunge in the share price since a September 2000 peak.
9/8/2002	Anthropologie and Others Arrive at the Westchester Mall	Shoppers will have new stores to choose from at at The Westchester in White Plains. Anthropologie opened in late May on Level 3. The store carries an eclectic selection of women's apparel, along with housewares and furniture reproduced from designs culled from Europe, India and the Far East.
9/5/2002	Tuning Up Mac OS X	To the Editor: ''Tuneup Lets the Mac Go Full Throttle'' (State of the Art, Aug. 22) argues that the Mac OS X 10.2 runs faster than its predecessor.
9/5/2002	The One-Piece Flat PC	To the Editor: Re ''IMac Envy: 2 PC's Try Going Flat'' (State of the Art, Aug. 29): The masses do in fact appreciate a ''one-piece, self-contained, flat-paneled computer.'' Long before the new iMacs appeared, many people had discovered that a laptop computer makes an excellent home computer.
8/29/2002	IMac Envy: 2 PC's Try Going Flat	EVERY now and then, I can't help marveling at the direction of popular tastes. I'll never understand why the TiVo video recorder isn't a smash hit, why men grow vertical-caterpillar goatees or why television viewers eliminated the singing sensation Tamyra Gray last week on ''American Idol.'' And ever since I got my hands on Apple's new iMac, I've marveled at another trend -- or the absence of one: that the masses don't seem to appreciate the benefits of a one-piece, self-contained, flat-panel computer. The iMac itself, a graceful piece of art whose astonishingly thin screen floats in air on a gleaming chrome elbow, sells well enough. But whenever a Windows PC maker tries something similar, buyers stay away in droves.
8/26/2002	Compressed Data; Happy Mac Becomes an Icon of the Past	Missing and presumed dead: the smiling ''happy Mac'' icon that for millions of Macintosh users had defined Apple's cuddly alternative to gray flannel corporate computing. Last week, Apple Computer announced 150 new features it added to the new Jaguar version of the Macintosh OS X operating system, but the smiling icon quietly vanished.
8/22/2002	Tuneup Lets Mac Go Full Throttle	WHEN Apple unveiled its Mac OS X operating system a couple of years ago, the company's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, explained that it offered two important benefits. First, Mac OS X (pronounced ''ten'') rests on a superstable, industrial-strength foundation called Unix. Second, Mac OS X is so beautiful, ''you just want to lick it.'' Many Mac fans weren't so sure they even wanted to touch it. Yes, Mac OS X is virtually crashproof. (In fact, one command tells you, in months, days and hours, how long your Mac has gone without having to be restarted -- a statistic that early adopters eagerly compared online.) But there was a price for this stability: a long list of beloved Mac OS 9 features had been moved around, stripped down or eliminated in Mac OS X, and the new system wasn't nearly as fast as Mac OS 9.
8/19/2002	Compressed Data; Out-of-It Eyebrow Lift Gives Apple a Superstar	Apple Computer has a hit on its hands. Not its elegant iMac desktop machines or the lustworthy iPod music player -- those are old news. This hit is a television ad featuring a slow-talking, engaging teenager, Ellen Feiss, who describes her decision to use Macintosh computers after a Windows PC ate her homework. ''It was, like, beep beep beep beep beep beep beep,'' she says, ''and then, like, half of my paper was gone.'' She characterizes the experience, over all, as a ''bummer.''
8/19/2002	Apple's Chief in the Risky Land of the Handhelds	It has long been Silicon Valley's favorite guessing game: What is Steven P. Jobs going to do next? The question is particularly engrossing as Apple Computer prepares to introduce the new version of its Macintosh OS X software operating system.
8/14/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Shifts Desktop Systems	Apple Computer said yesterday that it was shifting its entire professional desktop line of computers to dual microprocessor configurations. The systems will be available with twin 867-MHz, 1-GHz and 1.25-GHz G4 PowerPC microprocessors and range in price from $1,699 to $3,299. The new machines, available today, will come with Apple's newest Jaguar 10.2 version of its Macintosh OS X operating system, which is scheduled to be shipped commercially on Aug. 24. The computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it was reducing the price of two of the models of its flat-panel iMac line by $100 each, to $1,299 and $1,499 each. John Markoff (NYT)
8/14/2002	Companies Certify Data Today; Some Seem Quite Confused	Top executives at nearly half the companies required to do so have certified their financial statements ahead of today's deadline. But many companies remained confused last night about their responsibilities and potential penalties. Most companies are expected to file the statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have been reviewing their figures and consulting with their lawyers for weeks. After such a review, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced a modest earnings restatement yesterday.
7/18/2002	Struts and Stuff At Apple Show	YOU can have your Springsteen concert, your big Vegas magic show, your East River fireworks. For the true-blue Macintosh fan, they pale next to the greatest show on earth: the keynote speech at the annual Macworld Expo in New York. Yesterday Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, took the stage at the Javits Center, as he does each summer, to unveil Apple's latest work. But to call his presentation a speech would be like calling Noah's flood a puddle. In his reality-distortion field, every new machine is a revolution, every new program is a revelation -- and for two blissful hours, Microsoft and its 95 percent market share don't exist.
7/18/2002	In Midst of a PC Slump, Apple Still Aims for Growth	For Apple Computer, a product innovator with an anemic market share, a prosperous future depends on persuading some of the legions of people who use personal computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system to switch to Apple's Macintosh technology. The keynote speech yesterday by Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, at the Macworld trade show in New York, the company's new marketing campaign and its aggressive plan to open more retail stores this year in the midst of an industry slump all point to the need to win converts from the Windows camp.
7/18/2002	In Its New House, Apple Goes Bauhaus	CONSUMER products are the stars of the new Apple retail store in SoHo. The store's design is fairly bland compared with the suave styling that has won Apple's products legions of loyal fans over the years. But the shop's minimalist forms and neutral palette nonetheless go far toward establishing the claim that Apple's products are today's modern classics. The space, designed by Peter Bohlin and Ronnette Riley, under the direction of the Apple superhero Steve Jobs, is carved out of the ground and second floors of a handsome old post office on the northeast corner of Prince and Greene Streets. It opens today, bringing the number of Apple stores nationwide to 32.
7/17/2002	Gray Outlook From Intel; Bluer Skies At Motorola	Intel, the world's largest microchip manufacturer, said yesterday that it had encountered few signs of economic recovery in the second quarter and that it expected weaker than normal seasonal improvement in demand the rest of the year. As a result, Intel said, it plans cost-cutting measures, including a cut in capital spending and the elimination of about 4,000 jobs, almost 5 percent of its work force. It has cut about 5,000 jobs in the last year.
7/17/2002	Apple Reports Profit Slide; No Rebound Is Seen Soon	Reflecting doldrums throughout the computer industry, Apple Computer said today that its fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenues slid. Like other personal computer companies and chip makers, the company said it saw no early turnaround in its fortunes. Apple warned on June 18 that its third-quarter financial results would not meet initial analysts' expectations, but in a conference call today, Apple's chief financial officer, Fred Anderson, offered a litany of gloomy forecasts showing that the personal computer market was contracting sharply.
6/20/2002	A Shop Where Fun Meets Function	ON prominent display at Tekserve, a giant Macintosh repair center in Manhattan, is a battery-operated ''farm radio'' from the 1920's, its vacuum tubes glistening inside a thick glass case. There are also old television sets in wooden cabinets, manual typewriters and mechanical adding machines. ''Computers are only the latest technological wave,'' explained Dick Demenus, one of Tekserve's founders. ''There was radio, TV, the telephone -- each of those was at least as important.''
6/10/2002	Apple Ad Campaign Stars Former Microsoft Users	Apple Computer plans to begin a nationwide print and television advertising campaign on Monday focusing on people who have switched to Apple's Macintosh from computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. The series features individuals standing against a white background talking about how they felt after moving away from Windows. The statements are meant to be informal and personal, and one Macintosh convert likens using a Windows-based computer to ''being stuck in a bad relationship.''
6/5/2002	Technology Briefing | Software: Apple Introduces Media Player	Apple Computer made available the first public version of its software media player, QuickTime 6, yesterday. The new software competes directly with Real Player from Real Networks and Windows Media Player from Microsoft. All three companies are using their technologies to push personal computing into the entertainment and interactive media businesses. Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, said yesterday that QuickTime 6 was distinguished by its support for a new international standard for view multimedia called MPEG-4, which offers a variety of enhancements for viewing video and listening to audio via the Internet. Both Real Networks and Apple have endorsed the MPEG-4 standard while Microsoft has chosen to support a proprietary technology named Corona. Apple also said yesterday that it would make its new Emac computer more widely available. When the computer was originally introduced this year, Mr. Jobs aimed the machine at the educational market. He said the computer, which is priced at $1,099, was being sold more broadly because his customers ''had beaten him up'' for not making it available to all potential buyers. John Markoff (NYT)
5/20/2002	Compressed Data; Honest, a Balky PC Is Not a Pop Star's Fault	No, your computer has not become finicky, and it is not Celine Dion's fault, whatever other artistic misdeeds she may have committed. European fans of Ms. Dion have been discovering that her new CD, ''A New Day Has Come,'' incorporates technology to protect it against being copied and prevents it from being played in personal computers.
5/15/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple To Offer Server Computer	The Apple Computer chairman, Steven P. Jobs, said the company would re-enter the corporate computing market next month with a pizza-box-size machine designed for data centers. Apple is trying to capitalize on the popularity of its Macintosh OS X Unix operating system, which Mr. Jobs developed at Next Computer and then sold to Apple in 1996. The new rack-mounted Xserve computer will be priced at $2,999 to $6,500 and will come with as much as 480 gigabytes of storage and a high-speed network connection. Such computers have become a standard in corporate computing centers for applications that range from file storage and printer management to Web servers as well as database and scientific computing. Mr. Jobs said Apple's strategy in entering an intensely competitive computing market dominated by giant, well-established companies would be to focus initially on the company's strongest markets: education, creative services, biotechnology and video. John Markoff (NYT)
5/9/2002	From Symantec, Security Tools For Online Users of Mac OS X	Apple's OS X operating system, with its attractive interface, has gained plenty of fans since its debut last year. And more users took it to heart when Microsoft shipped its Office X software suite for Macintosh a few months ago. But for anyone using e-mail or the Web, there was another story. Running Office X or anything Net-bound on OS X meant running with no active virus protection. Now OS X is has an added measure of safety. Symantec (www.symantec.com) has begun shipping a variety of system enhancements for OS X (and its predecessors OS 9 and 8.1). One, AntiVirus, does what its name claims, and another, Personal Firewall 2.0, keeps hackers out of broadband users' computers. Each sells for $69.95; bundled as Internet Security 2.0, they go for $99.95.
5/7/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Introduces New Service	Apple Computer yesterday gave a brief demonstration of iChat, an instant messenger program that is intended to be compatible with America Online's AOL Instant Messenger Service. Apple demonstrated its new instant messenger client at the first day of the company's annual World Wide Developer Conference that began yesterday in San Jose, Calif. Officials of AOL, a unit of AOL Time Warner, said that this was the first time they had permitted another company to independently build an Instant Messenger client that was compatible with the AOL service that reaches 150 million users. The Apple program is planned for a late summer release as part of a new version of the company's Mac OS X operating system that was also demonstrated yesterday. John Markoff (NYT)
5/2/2002	Making Apple's MP3 Player Compatible With the Masses	With hundreds of millions more Windows PC's than Macs in the world, you may wonder why Apple Computer does not offer a version of its iPod portable MP3 player that is compatible with the majority. While Apple will not say whether it will ultimately offer software that would make the iPod play nice with Windows, two other companies have already made the leap.
4/30/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Offers PC For Schools	Apple Computer introduced the eMac yesterday, a white all-in-one computer resembling the original iMac that will be marketed to students and educators. The machine, with a 17-inch monitor and 700 gigahertz processor, starts at $999. For years Apple dominated educational sales, but its share has dwindled. Released in 1998, the iMac was a big success. The eEmac has a bigger screen, recordable CD-ROM drive, 40-gigabyte hard drive and 128 megabytes of memory. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
4/18/2002	The Beige Box Fades to Black	THE beige-box personal computer, the drab diehard of modern industrial design, became a visual standard without a lot of deep thought in 1981, when I.B.M. introduced its PC. It was functional, neutral, almost non-design, says Lee Green, the company's current director of design. Yet beige box it was, and bland proliferated for two decades, long after ''it was obvious they were beyond boring,'' Mr. Green said. Even earlier, the Apple II in 1977 was mostly beige, and the first cuddly Macintosh in 1984 was beige, though it was no conventional box. Irrefutably, however, it was I.B.M. that brought the personal computer into the mainstream, and the industry -- except for Apple -- followed its lead in industrial design, or the lack of it. The companies that rose in I.B.M.'s wake -- Compaq, Dell, Gateway and others -- were aptly termed clones.
4/18/2002	Apple Computer Beats Earnings Estimates in Second Quarter	Apple Computer overcame supply difficulties to post second-quarter earnings exceeding analysts' expectations, indicating the company's flashy new iMac home computer was being well received. Apple has been looking for a way to break out of its shrinking niche in the personal computer industry and win back market share, and the quarter's numbers indicated that it had made some progress.
4/5/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Buys Firewire Developer	Apple Computer Inc. said it had acquired Zayante, a closely held networking company, for an undisclosed price. Zayante, once called Firefly, was founded in 1996 by a group of former Apple employees who, while at Apple, had invented an unusually fast way of transferring data between devices. Zayante makes chips and software used with the technology, which is formally designated I.E.E.E. 1394 and is known as FireWire. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., said it had retained major employees of Zayante, including its president, Prashant Kanhere, and its co-founder and chief technology officer, Michael Johas Teener, who was the chief architect of the original FireWire project at Apple. Chris Gaither (NYT)
4/4/2002	U.S.B. Device Gives Mac Users Another Wireless Option	A tiny U.S.B. device from D-Link and a free software download from Apple now allow owners of newer Macintosh computers to use Bluetooth, the short-distance wireless system. They may, however, have trouble finding something to do with the technology. Unlike the 802.11b wireless standard, which Apple calls AirPort and others have named Wi-Fi, Bluetooth is not intended for computer networking or sharing high-speed Internet connections. Instead Bluetooth is mostly about replacing cables between electronic gadgets.
3/21/2002	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Apple Raising Prices Of iMac	Apple Computer said yesterday that it would raise prices on its popular flat-panel iMac by $100 because of cost increases in displays and memory chips. It said it had sold 125,000 of the new computers since it began shipping them at the end of January and that it now had a backlog of 100,000 orders. Apple Computer said at the end of January that it had orders for 150,000 computers, a rate that was faster than that for the original iMac. In recent weeks, reports of tight iMac supplies have led to speculation about Apple's quarterly results, but Apple said it was sticking by the guidance it issued at the beginning of the quarter. Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, said it was now making 5,000 iMacs a day, but that it was facing a 25 percent increase in display costs and a tripling in memory cost since the introduction of the new computer. John Markoff (NYT)
3/14/2002	Piracy, or Innovation? It's Hollywood vs. High Tech	Leaders of two of the nation's most prominent industries, entertainment and technology, have begun publicly sniping at each other over how to stop consumers from illegally copying digital movies, music and television programs. The feud grows out of Hollywood's frustration with the illicit flow of copyrighted works over the Internet. Despite courtroom victories against Napster and others deemed to contribute to Internet piracy, millions of people continue to download free digital copies of everything from Jennifer Lopez's latest hit single to the Disney movie ''Monsters, Inc.''
3/7/2002	Stopping Hackers, While Doing Detective Work on the Side	Worrying about hackers and viruses is becoming a way of life for Windows users, but Macintosh owners should not assume they are immune to Internet ills. For them, Symantec has announced Version 2 of its Norton Personal Firewall for Macintosh ($69.95 or $39.95 for an upgrade). The program is also available ($99.95 or $69.95 for the upgrade) in the larger Norton Internet Security suite, which includes Norton Anti-Virus and Aladdin's iClean clutter-reducing software. Symantec has also updated its Norton Utilities and Norton AntiVirus software, along with its SystemWorks suite. The updated programs include versions written specifically for Mac OS X and separate versions for Mac OS 8.1 to OS 9. (Details can be found at www.symantec.com/mac.)
3/1/2002	CD Technology Stops Copies, But It Starts A Controversy	The recording industry has begun selling music CD's designed to make it impossible for people to copy music to their computers, trade songs over the Internet or transfer them to portable MP3 players. Until now, most of the protected discs have been distributed in Europe, with little publicity. But the strategy has already provoked a reaction there. There are also objections from American music lovers who fear that they will be unable to use the increasingly popular portable MP3 devices or burn their own CD's to copy music that they have legally purchased.
2/28/2002	A Long Time Ago, in a Lab Far Away . . .	STEVE RUSSELL sat in a darkened movie theater recently watching the army of credits roll by after a computer-animated Hollywood blockbuster. There was a time, he recalls thinking, when a cutting-edge computer-generated fantasy could be conceived, written, tested and packaged for distribution in a few months, just through the part-time efforts of a small group of friends.
2/27/2002	Moog and Apple Computer Honored	For the machines behind the music, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is to award technical Grammys tonight to Robert Moog, who developed a groundbreaking synthesizer, and to Apple Computer Inc., the first time a computer company has received a Grammy. The academy noted that Mr. Moog's name became synonymous with the Moog synthesizer, which was introduced in 1965 and which helped fuel the electronic music revolution.
2/8/2002	Computer Safety Is Focus of Bill	The House approved more than $800 million in grants today covering the next five years for the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to conduct research on ways to strengthen network and computer security. ''Our economy relies on a vast information infrastructure that is woefully under protected,'' said Representative Brian Baird, Democrat of Washington.
1/29/2002	A Faster Line Of Computers From Apple	Apple Computer said today that for the first time it had broken the 1 gigahertz mark in single-processor performance in its personal computer product line, introducing a new high-end desktop system priced at $2,999. The company also said that it had begun shipping its flat-panel-display iMac G4, and that it had received more than 150,000 orders for the new system since it was introduced three weeks ago. The order rate is a record, the company said, with orders exceeding the original iMac computer introduced in 1998.
1/17/2002	Apple's Retail Stores Show Positive Data on Customers	Apple Computer said yesterday that 40 percent of the people who bought computers at the 27 retail stores it has opened in recent months were first-time users of Macintosh machines. The figure, analysts say, is an encouraging sign for the company's strategy of trying to lure newcomers to Macintosh, whose users are loyal but less than 5 percent of all personal computer buyers. The optimistic signal came as Apple reported quarterly results that underlined the challenge the company faces. Apple reported earnings that were in line with Wall Street's consensus estimates, but its sales results were somewhat below analysts' expectations.
1/14/2002	Media; A Cover for Steve Jobs, a Faux Pas for Time	Understatement is not common to conversation in the United States, but Canadians are good at it. Consider the words of Steven Frank, the Toronto bureau chief of Time magazine, on the frenzy after timecanada .com published the magazine's exclusive account of the new iMac computer a week ago Sunday night, 12 hours too soon. ''I know there was some kerfuffle about it,'' Mr. Frank said drily last week. ''But I'm not 100 percent sure what or why.''
1/12/2002	Federal Judge Deals Setback To Microsoft In Private Suits	Microsoft suffered a setback in its recent campaign to resolve its legal problems yesterday, when a federal judge in Baltimore rejected a proposed settlement of more than 100 private class-action suits against the company. Under the proposal, Microsoft had agreed to donate $500 million in cash, in addition to computers and software to thousands of public schools in low-income neighborhoods. Microsoft and plaintiffs' lawyers who agreed to the settlement estimated the total value of the settlement at $1 billion, though opponents of the five-year plan said the figure was inflated because the actual cost to Microsoft of software donations was very little.
1/11/2002	Bold New Look, Tired Old Metaphor	Yes, I love it, it's just too wonderful; now let's get down to business. Apple's new iMac is indeed unique. It is the first desktop computer of the new millennium to trigger a gale-force hype storm. The iMac has a flat-screen display joined by a swiveling stalk to a domed base. In some ways, it's great. I have long complained that personal computers are ugly and all alike and badly suited to the desktop landscape. The new iMac is not ugly, is distinctive and finally liberates some of the desktop space that PC's normally hog out of pure pigginess: the hemispheric base has a delightfully small footprint.
1/10/2002	Apple, in Search of Perfection, Enlarges iBook's Screen	A pleasant surprise awaited Apple executives when they tallied feedback forms from customers of the popular, all-white iBook laptop. Apple said the most frequent response to ''What would you like to see changed?'' was ''Not a thing.'' The No. 2 most popular answer was ''Make the screen bigger.'' At 12.1 inches, the original screen made small text hard to read.
1/10/2002	Video, Music, Now Photos: For Mac Users, the i's Have It	First came iMovie, free Apple software that made video editing simple on Macintosh computers, and iDVD, which allowed Mac fans to burn those movies onto blank DVD's. Then came iTunes, a free Apple program for managing music collections and burning them onto CD's. Now comes iPhoto, the latest prong in Apple's strategy to make the Macintosh a digital hub for gadgets like music players and cameras. When a recent-model digital camera is plugged into a Mac, iPhoto opens automatically; one click on an Import button extracts the photos from the camera and organizes them onscreen. A slider smoothly enlarges or shrinks images for easier examination.
1/10/2002	For Apple, To Be Flat Is a Virtue	HEY, kids, have you heard? It's new, from the makers of SimCity. It's the crazy business-simulation game that's got everybody talking: SimApple! You play Steve Jobs, the driven perfectionist who runs the world's least conventional computer company. Since 1998, Apple has sold six million iMacs, the one-piece, supersimple computers that you made available in a choice of translucent fruit colors. In homage to its influence, store shelves soon filled with translucent, fruit-colored flashlights, alarm clocks and soap dispensers.
12/11/2001	Judge Asks Further Look at Microsoft Plan for Needy Schools	A judge asked lawyers for Microsoft today whether a rival's idea for revising the company's plan to equip needy schools with computers was not a better idea. Judge J. Frederick Motz of the United States District Court said that Microsoft's proposed settlement contained ''structural biases'' that would help the company gain control of one of the few software markets where it faces vigorous competition. Microsoft offered the plan to resolve 150 lawsuits accusing it of using its Windows monopoly to overcharge consumers.
12/3/2001	Microsoft Deal Worries Apple	To Apple Computer, the proposal by Microsoft and plaintiffs to settle more than 100 class-action antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft is riddled with flaws -- and carries a big competitive threat. Microsoft's proposal to donate more than $1 billion in software, computers and expertise to the nation's poorest schools would do little damage to the company's bottom line, Apple and other critics say, but would help it shore up its lead in one market it does not already dominate: education. Apple has long been a significant player in the education market for computers, though its share has been shrinking in recent years.
12/1/2001	Apple Offers More Than an Update to Its System	Sometimes engineers fix software mistakes; other times the task falls to lawyers. When Apple Computer Inc. released the latest update to its operating system, OS X, it offered the compact disc with the updating software free to users who already had the earlier version of the system.
11/28/2001	U.S. Judge Questions Plan For Deal in Microsoft Case	A federal judge today questioned whether Microsoft's $1 billion plan to give computers to schools to settle consumer antitrust claims would give it an unfair advantage in one of the few markets where it faces competition from Apple Computer Inc. Judge J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court asked lawyers for class-action plaintiffs who negotiated the settlement to respond to criticism from Apple, Red Hat Inc. and industry groups that allowing Microsoft to donate software and refurbished personal computers would entrench the company's monopoly in operating systems.
11/11/2001	1,000 Songs In Your Pocket	Apple's new MP3 player, the iPod, is the ultimate fashion accessory for the chic and famous. Introduced yesterday, the high-design white and chrome iPod is the size of a cassette tape and weighs about six ounces: small enough to tuck into an inside pocket or evening bag.
11/7/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Software Damages Hard Drives	Some Macintosh computer users lost data from their hard drives as a result of a bug in a program that Apple Computer made available over the weekend, the company said yesterday. The bug was part of a program used to install the latest version of Apple's new music software, iTunes 2.0. Apple made the software available for download on its Web site on Friday night. The company said it quickly heard from several people who said their hard drives had been damaged when they installed the program. Apple said it had identified the problem and replaced the problem program by Saturday morning. The problem had not affected everyone who downloaded the program, Apple said, but only a subset who, among other particulars, were using Apple's Mac OS X operating system and had partitioned their hard disks into two or more drives.

11/1/2001	The 'Unveiling' of iPod	To the Editor: Re ''Apple's Musical Rendition: A Jukebox Fed by the Mac'' (State of the Art, Oct. 25), about the iPod portable music player, which Apple promoted but did not identify before its release:
10/25/2001	Apple's Musical Rendition: A Jukebox Fed by the Mac	APPLE doesn't send out greeting cards very often, especially by FedEx. So when the company mailed cards to reporters last week, too soon for Christmas and too rushed for Halloween, some curiosity was understandable. The message inside heralded the imminent unveiling of ''a breakthrough digital device'' that Apple wouldn't identify, except to say that it wasn't a Mac. What could the new machine be? On the Web, Apple fans and foes whipped themselves into a frenzy of speculation.
10/24/2001	Apple Introduces What It Calls an Easier to Use Portable Music Player	Apple Computer introduced a portable music player today and declared that the new gadget, called the iPod, was so much easier to use that it would broaden a nascent market in the way the Macintosh once helped make the personal computer accessible to a more general audience. But while industry analysts said the device appeared to be as consumer friendly as the company said it was, they also pointed to its relatively limited potential audience, around seven million owners of the latest Macintosh computers. Apple said it had not yet decided whether to introduce a version of the music player for computers with the Windows operating system, which is used by more than 90 percent of personal computer users.
10/18/2001	XP's 'Time Bomb'	To the Editor: The copy-protection scheme for Windows XP that you describe in ''Dear User: This Bootleg Copy Will Self-Destruct in 30 Days'' (Sept. 6) appears identical to the notorious ''challenge response'' system utilized by some software manufacturers in the Mac world. The problem is that a protection system tied to changes to hardware (or system software as well, in the case of the Mac) doesn't take into account the vagaries of real world usage. In Italy, far from e-mail or a phone, I once found an important piece of protected software not working because I had done a routine maintenance chore the day before.
10/18/2001	Apple Tops Analysts' Lowered Forecasts	Apple Computer, saying it has been buoyed by strong sales to schools and students, reported today results for its fourth quarter that exceeded analysts' expectations. But the company said its own expectations for the current quarter are below those previously forecast by many analysts, asserting that the terror attacks and the weak economy have made it cautious about holiday sales projections.
8/22/2001	Apple to Get Emmy Award For Device	Apple Computer is getting an unusual customer endorsement today -- an Emmy award from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Apple's Emmy is an engineering award for FireWire, an advanced data-transport technology for connecting peripheral devices to computers. FireWire has many uses, but in television production it is used to connect digital cameras and video-editing equipment to a computer, and then shuttle images quickly and flawlessly back and forth.
8/16/2001	The Apple Cube Entered The Museum as It Exited Stores	''True, it looks like it belongs in the Museum of Modern Art,'' read an advertisement from Apple Computer last year. ''But the G4 Cube is actually a supercomputer that belongs right on your desk.'' Now, less than a year after its introduction, the Cube is indeed in the Museum of Modern Art -- and out of production. The Cube was acquired for the Modern's design collection, along with six other Apple products, shortly before Apple announced the Cube's demise. ''The personality of these objects is incredibly important,'' said Paola Antonelli, the curator of Workspheres, a recent exhibition that included several Apple products. ''These objects give more meaning to the desk and the work. They are pleasant companions.''
8/2/2001	Gateway Heads for Campus With a New Notebook	With the school year soon to start, computer makers have begun rolling out machines intended to wind up in knapsacks. Following the lead of Apple's newest iBook, the Solo 1200 notebook from Gateway is aiming for part of the education market.
7/26/2001	So Many Online Providers	To the Editor: ''Is There Life After AOL?'' (June 21) left out perhaps the most essential fact about each of the seven other Internet service providers that you elected to discuss: that is, whether the I.S.P. provides software compatible with both PC and Macintosh computers. We Mac users would be wasting our time getting in touch with Juno since, as their Web site plainly states, it does not offer a Mac version.
7/26/2001	A Speedier Way to Run Mac Programs on Windows	Apple loyalists might consider selling Windows software at a Macintosh trade show akin to a Hatfield's showing up at a McCoy family reunion. But SoftMac Xpress, unveiled last week by Emulators Inc. at MacWorld Expo in New York, is the latest version of software that lets Windows users run Macintosh programs and open Mac files on their Windows machines. The new program, SoftMac Xpress, will work with Windows 98 and 2000 and the next version of Windows XP. Emulation software does just what the name implies: emulate or mimic a different operating system so users can run programs written for other systems without having to purchase new computers. Like its predecessor, SoftMac 2000, SoftMac Xpress works with the older 68K Macintosh programs but not with software written for PowerPC. (A PowerPC emulator is expected later this year.)
7/23/2001	New Economy; The pioneering spirit lives on at Apple Computer, and the industry cannot afford to ignore it.	BY the usual yardstick of market share, Apple Computer is a computing pipsqueak. Its slender slice of personal computer sales is less than 4 percent in the United States, and its share of the global market is even slimmer. Yet in terms of industry attention, press coverage and attendance at trade shows like the Macworld Expo in New York last week, Apple still looms pretty large. Why? History and wishful thinking are part of the explanation. Apple was a pioneer, so an inordinate share of industry people and technology journalists got hooked on computing thanks to the Apple II and, later, the Macintosh.
7/19/2001	Apple Announces Price Cuts And Product Improvements	Apple Computer Inc. announced yesterday a series of aggressive performance improvements and price cuts on its desktop computers for consumers and professionals, and previewed the first upgrade of its new OS X operating system. The pace of the improvement in the performance of Apple's machines, analysts say, is impressive. Some lines have nearly doubled the processing speed, doubled memory and tripled storage capacity, compared with machines at the same price just a year ago. In the past, Apple's computers have often been praised for their stylish design yet criticized for being more expensive than comparably powered standard PC's, which run on Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's microprocessor.
7/18/2001	Earnings at Apple Beat Expectations; Sales Miss Target	Apple Computer Inc. reported quarterly earnings yesterday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but its sales were slightly below analysts' estimates. The quarterly results suggest that Apple is managing its business efficiently during a difficult period for the personal computer business and the economy. But the soft revenue figures, analysts say, also indicate that the main issue surrounding Apple -- whether it can expand beyond its base of dedicated users and increase its share of the PC market -- remains unresolved.
7/12/2001	To Cash In on a Lifestyle, Apple Hits the Mall	THE store is so self-aware that it doesn't even have its name on a sign. Instead, a glowing white apple with an iconic bite beckons shoppers in an upscale mall in this affluent Washington suburb. Inside the white airy interior, black-clad salesclerks walk the bleached wooden floor, past translucent computers, petite digital cameras and slim scanners.

Inside the white airy interior, black-clad salesclerks walk the bleached wooden floor, past translucent computers, petite digital cameras and slim scanners.
7/4/2001	Apple Will Halt Production Of Its Cube-Shaped Computer	Apple Computer said today that it would stop making its Power Mac G4 Cube, a machine heavy on design innovation but short on buyers, less than a year after the product line was first sold. Sales of the cube-shaped computer have fallen sharply since its introduction in late July last year, causing Apple to miss earnings projections and contributing to the company's first quarterly net loss since Steven P. Jobs returned as chief executive in 1997.
6/28/2001	More Muscular Software Makes VCD's Feel the Burn	Still saving up the $800 for a DVD burner? In the meantime, the newest version of Toast software from Roxio Inc. makes it possible for Macintosh users to both encode and burn video CD's that will play on most DVD machines, although the picture quality will not match that of a true DVD. Roxio already produces a similar product for Windows, Easy CD Creator, but this is the first combination encoder and burner product especially for Macs. The new software, Toast 5 Titanium, updates the classic Macintosh CD utility with a new look and features. The $89 program has been upgraded to burn both video and audio CD's in the background while you tackle other tasks on the computer, and it's now compatible with Apple's music management and CD burning software, iTunes. (Toast can also copy VCD's of VCD's.)
6/14/2001	Making a Man Out of a Mac: Adding Gigabytes to an iBook	With iMovie being shipped with every Macintosh iBook and promoted in television advertisements, the 10-gigabyte hard drive that comes as standard equipment with the unit will quickly prove inadequate for anyone trying to edit even a short digital movie. The LaCie PocketDrive, which adds up to 30 gigabytes of storage in a portable hard drive, is one solution for laptop users who need more real estate. Hard drives, even those in laptops, are delicate and prone to damage from the bumps and bounces of travel. LaCie has tried to solve that problem by surrounding the PocketDrive with rubber bumpers. The company suggests that if you treat the drive with respect, it can stand up to the rigors of the road -- as long as those rigors are not too rigorous.
6/10/2001	Business; The Corporate Alliance, as a Tightrope Act	BY announcing last month that it would no longer sell tires to the Ford Motor Company, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. completed the unraveling of a relationship that had spanned nearly a century. But in the arena of business alliances, the surprise was that Firestone's ''Dear John'' letter came so late in the relationship.
6/6/2001	Apple Settles iMac Infringement Lawsuit	Apple Computer Inc. settled a lawsuit today with Future Power, a computer maker that was building Windows-based personal computers that looked like Apple's iMac. Future Power, a closely held company based in Santa Clara, said it had agreed to comply with a court order that prevents it from selling a 15-inch all-in-one computer with a translucent cover until Feb. 1, 2004. The two companies agreed that Future Power could sell a newly designed 17-inch personal computer with a colored plastic cover.
5/31/2001	4 Laptops Lilliputians Might Like	EVEN in these technologically enlightened times, most laptops fall into one of two equally compromised categories. First, there's the full-size laptop, which offers most standard PC features but begins to weigh as much as a small Steinway by the time you reach Concourse Z. Second, there's the ultralight laptop. Although they weigh only two or three pounds, these models relegate critical components like the CD-ROM drive to a detachable docking station. Unfortunately, without a CD drive, you can't install new programs or resuscitate a dead machine on the road, so many people wind up lugging along the docking stations -- piano-moving time all over again. At this rate, we'll soon see ads for a one-pound laptop that's nothing but a keyboard; the rest will be a ''docking station.''
5/21/2001	Grudge Match; For Michael Dell and Steve Jobs An Old Rivalry Still Boils	They represent the rival styles of the graying personal computer industry, and they don't seem to like each other very much. In one corner stands the 46-year-old Steven P. Jobs, co-founder and chairman of Apple Computer, the former prodigy who in 1977 introduced the Apple II, the machine that dominated the first generation of personal computing. In the other corner is Michael S. Dell, 36, founder and chairman of Dell Computer, who as a college student in the 1980's took the anti-Apple machine -- the Intel-Microsoft-based PC -- and began revolutionizing the way desktop computers were sold.
5/16/2001	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Apple To Open 25 Retail Stores	Apple Computer Inc., maker of the iMac personal computer, will open 25 retail stores this year to attract new customers by establishing more outlets for promoting its computers and software. The company will open stores in shopping areas that cater to affluent consumers in cities like New York, Chicago and San Jose, Calif., the chief executive, Steve Jobs, said. The first shops will open Saturday in McLean, Va., and Glendale, Calif.
5/8/2001	In a Shift in Strategy, Apple Is Making Plans to Open Its First Stores	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it was expanding into the retail business, confirming that it planned to open its first store on May 19. A computer industry analyst said the company might open as many as 10 stores as part of a strategy to extend the Apple brand.
5/2/2001	Apple Offers Lighter iBook For Classroom	Seeking to recapture its fading leadership in the educational computer market, Apple Computer Inc. introduced a more compact and less expensive version of its iBook consumer-oriented portable computer today. The machine, at 4.9 pounds and a starting price of $1,299, is about 2 pounds lighter and $200 cheaper than the previous iBook model. And it has more standard features than comparable machines offered by Compaq and Dell, said Steven P. Jobs, chairman of Apple.
4/19/2001	Apple Returns to Profitability on Strength of New Portable PC	Largely on the strength of its hot-selling one-inch-thick titanium-clad portable computer, Apple Computer surprised Wall Street today by reporting a net profit of $43 million, or 12 cents a share, for its second fiscal quarter. After a loss in Apple's first fiscal quarter, analysts had expected the company to achieve only a razor-thin profit of a penny a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
4/12/2001	Videodiscs With You As Director	TO do-it-yourself moviemakers, nothing is more frustrating than the current chasm between the technology for creating digital movies and the technology for distributing them. The first part is easy: using a $700 digital camcorder, you can capture footage with astonishing detail, sharpness and color fidelity. Using editing software, you can add credits, fade-ins and fade-outs, and music from an audio CD. The quality of the result is simply spectacular -- when played back on your computer monitor or the camcorder's little flip-out screen. But to present the finished masterpiece to your adoring fans worldwide, you face two grim alternatives: you must either dump it out onto a VHS tape, sacrificing 50 percent of the digital quality in the process, or post it on the Web as a crummy, flickering movie the size of a Wheat Thin. Either way, you'll find yourself standing outside Blockbuster that night in the rain, peering through the window at the shelves of smug little DVD's. You'll be tormented by the inaccessibility of their superior video quality, 100-year life span and handy menu system, which lets the viewer jump instantly to different video chapters.
4/5/2001	Operation Mac	To the Editor: Apple has routinely reinvented the Mac OS over the years. For ''A New Face (and Heart) for the Mac'' (State of the Art, March 29) to say the Mac OS 9 ''rests on the body of a 1984 Volkswagen Rabbit'' is like saying the Discovery space shuttle rests on the body of The Spirit of St. Louis. By contrast, the article characterizes the UNIX-based Mac OS X as a ''modern'' operating system. However, UNIX was christened around 1970 -- is the Mac OS X resting on the body of a VW Super Beetle?
4/5/2001	Operation Mac	To the Editor: The ac OS X is supposedly the move that will reverse Apple's ever-shrinking market share. This major advance is for the few -- the Mac OS X released on March 24 is still a test version, even though it sold for $129. It won't launch if you have peripherals attached, voids third-party RAM, loses applications, freezes laptops and is slow as molasses. ARTHUR STRAUSS, M.D. Irvine, Calif.
3/29/2001	A New Face (And Heart) For the Mac	APPLE may have revolutionized computing by popularizing overlapping windows, file icons and the mouse, but that was a while ago. When Apple designed the original Macintosh operating system, ''CD'' stood for ''certificate of deposit,'' ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' was on television, and floppy disks were still floppy. Since then, generations of Apple programmers have come and gone, piling on features and, behind the scenes, grumbling about the ''spaghetti code'' that the Mac OS was becoming. Today's Mac OS 9 is familiar, attractive and loaded with shortcuts, but as the Mac OS 9 parade float drives down Main Street, it rests on the body of a 1984 Volkswagen Rabbit.
3/22/2001	Apple, at Last, Has New Operating System for Macs	Seventeen years after first marketing the personal computer based on icon and mouse, Apple Computer will introduce on Saturday the first complete revision of the operating system for its Macintosh computers. The new Macintosh OS X (pronounced oh-ess-ten), as tempered by the company's tangled history, is a blend of several new technologies and the venerable Unix operating system, developed by Bell Labs in the 1960's and 70's. It will sell for $129 retail.
3/1/2001	Putting A New Soul In Your PC	I HAVE used the Macintosh operating system for more than a decade, and Windows off and on since it became less annoying a few years ago, but the notion of trying Linux intrigued me. Could someone like me, without a computer science degree or past love affairs with a Radio Shack TRS-80, do anything with Linux -- like installing it on an old PC and getting it to do things I usually do on my I.B.M. ThinkPad or Mac G4 desktop-tower machine? Linux, the free, sturdy operating system created 10 years ago by Linus Torvalds of Finland, has been getting more and more attention in the last couple of years because it has a populist cachet and runs well on inexpensive hardware; Version 2.4 of the Linux kernel (the brains of the system) was released in January. It has made inroads in the server market, but it is also starting to show up installed on personal computers from major computer makers like I.B.M. and Dell as an alternative to Windows.
2/22/2001	APPLE ADDING FEATURES	Trying to entice consumers with wild patterns referred to as Blue Dalmatian and Flower Power molded directly into the plastic of the popular iMac home computer, the chief executive of Apple Computer, Steven P. Jobs announced several new consumer-oriented products in Tokyo yesterday. The new multihued iMacs, which will have faster processors and the ability to both read and write CD's, will be priced at $899 and $1,499. Apple also introduced a faster version of its G4 Cube computer, which will also come with the ability to write directly to blank CD's and will be priced at $1,599. John Markoff
2/11/2001	He Said Surfboard, Not Stanford	Lawrence J. Ellison didn't need a college degree to achieve success. Neither did William H. Gates, whom he describes as his former friend, nor Steven P. Jobs, whom he describes as a best friend now. When Mr. Ellison's 18-year-old son, David, told his father that he wanted to go to Stanford, Mr. Ellison suggested that he look elsewhere. ''What about Pepperdine?'' with its terrific surfing opportunities, he asked his son. ''It's in Malibu.''
1/18/2001	Apple Posts $247 Million Loss for Quarter	Struggling to cope with falling demand for its consumer products, Apple Computer reported a $247 million loss today for its first fiscal quarter, normally its strongest. A year ago Apple earned $183 million, or 51 cents a share. Apple had warned in December that an industrywide decline in personal computer sales would lead to a loss for the quarter and had said the company was focusing on reducing the inventory backlog in its distribution channels that had ballooned to 11 weeks. The company had also warned that it would have a revenue shortfall of $600 million.
1/18/2001	Microsoft Gives Boost To Outlook for Macintosh	Not all the good news for Mac fans comes from Apple; Microsoft recently offered some good news, too. First, the company announced that it will be updating its popular Office 2001 software suite to run on Apple's Mac OS X, which goes on sale March 24 and works best with software specially written for it. Second, Microsoft has announced a new program that's of little value to solo Mac users, but huge import to Mac renegades in corporations: a Macintosh version of Outlook, the e-mail, address book, calendar and collaboration program that anchors the PC lives of millions of PC workers. This completely rewritten program replaces the earlier, poorly regarded Outlook Exchange Server for Macintosh.
1/11/2001	Onboard DVD-R Drive Option Another First For Apple	Like most computer makers, Apple Computer has been hit hard by the recent decline of the home computer market. But the company is coming off the ropes swinging, using this week's Macworld Expo in San Francisco as an opportunity to unveil not only its new product line, but also its strategy for the future: to serve as the premier hub for the digital gizmos we carry around these days, like MP3 players, digital cameras and camcorders, Palm devices and DVD players. A cornerstone of this ''digital hub'' strategy is what Apple calls the SuperDrive, the first recordable DVD drive ever to appear in a personal computer. This drive will be an option in the company's new, top-of-the-line Power Macintosh model, which will reach the marketplace in late February. The drive, which combines a DVD player, DVD recorder and CD-RW drive, can burn video discs that play in any standard consumer DVD player, a feat that used to require a specialized $5,000 burner unit from Pioneer. (Pioneer manufactures Apple's new drive, which will also be available in upcoming Compaq PC's.)
1/11/2001	An End To Laptop Envy	MACINTOSH fans don't always have it easy. They're often found patiently (or vehemently) defending their choice of machine, they must endure occasional pundit predictions that Apple is doomed -- and then there's the Laptop Gap. At this very moment, a Mac fan with a pudgy 6.5-pound Apple PowerBook G3 is crammed into an airplane seat somewhere, looking longingly across the aisle as a smug fellow passenger slips open a sleek, superslim Windows laptop. At the Macworld Expo this week in San Francisco, Apple unveiled a raft of new products that rewarded Macolytes for their continued faith. But the best news was a new laptop, more than a year in the works, that may just reverse the direction of those longing looks on the airplane: the PowerBook G4.
1/11/2001	A Cheaper Flat Panel From Philips Electronics	Philips Electronics is giving Apple Computer a run for its money in the flat-panel monitor department -- and the money in question is about $100. The Philips 150X flat-panel monitor has a suggested retail price of $899, compared with $999 for Apple's stylish flat panel of the same screen size. The 150X, a 15-inch monitor with a liquid-crystal display and a brushed metallic look to its sturdy plastic housing, also has built-in twin stereo speakers and a headphone jack. Compared with a standard cathode-ray tube monitor, L.C.D. screens, which flicker less and present a brighter image, are typically easier on the eyes. They also used to cost far more than C.R.T. monitors, but prices for flat-panel screens have been falling over the past few years and are available for less than $1,000.
1/10/2001	Apple Putting Hopes on New Macintosh Line	Proclaiming the onset of a third ''golden age'' of personal computing, Steven P. Jobs today offered Apple Computer's latest bid to regain its luster: a revamped Macintosh line and an ultra-thin, titanium-clad portable model. Mr. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, took the stage at the annual MacWorld Exhibition here and made only a single, brief reference to the company's recent financial troubles, which have led to marked declines in revenue and profit.
1/3/2001	APPLE CUTS COMPUTER PRICES	Apple Computer cut prices up to $1,000 on its desktop and portable computers yesterday. The company made the changes quietly, by posting the lowered prices on its Web sites with no public announcement. A spokeswoman said the company was currently in a quiet period and would have no comment. The company said last month that it was planning to make a series of moves to reduce inventory, and a person close to the company said recently that Apple was hoping to reduce its inventory drastically to put its business problems behind it quickly. The company reduced the price of its entry-level G4 tower computer by $300 to $1,299, while the price of its G4 Cube computer, which has met disappointing demand, was lowered to $1,499 from $1,799. Apple's retailers said it had also reduced prices on portable systems, and its G3 Portable now sells for as little as $2,199. Prices were not lowered in either the iMac desktop or iBook portable systems. Apple is expected to introduce new computers at its annual Macworld event next week in San Francisco and several weeks later in Tokyo. John Markoff
12/21/2000	Macintosh Fans Can Finally Join The Speech Transcription Game	For years, Macintosh fans have stood on the sidelines, looking on as Windows users enjoyed a choice of several speech-transcription programs. Now there are two Mac programs that can transcribe speech that is dictated at conversational speed. But each of the new programs has room for improvement. I.B.M.'s ViaVoice Enhanced Edition ($150), an upgrade to the company's ViaVoice Millennium Edition, includes improved speed and accuracy, particularly in the included SpeakPad word processor. The Enhanced Edition also makes it possible to dictate directly to a handful of popular Mac programs, like Microsoft Word 98, AppleWorks 6, and Internet Explorer 4.5, although slowly and with some quirks.
12/6/2000	Apple Warns It Will Record Quarterly Loss	Apple Computer today became the latest technology company to warn that its earnings would not meet earlier projections. It said it would record a quarterly loss for the first time since Steven P. Jobs rejoined the company as its chief executive three years ago. Blaming both external economic factors and its own business miscalculations, Apple projected that revenue for its first fiscal quarter, ending Dec. 30, would be around $1 billion. The projection, a sharp drop from the $1.6 billion the company projected in October, will translate to a loss of $225 million to $250 million for the quarter, the company said.
10/30/2000	New Economy; Airborne and grass roots. By popular acclaim, a wireless format with a name only a geek could love is taking hold.	AT the recent Agenda 2001 computer conference in Phoenix earlier this month, there was validation and a touch of irony for the conference organizer, Robert Metcalfe, co-inventor of the Ethernet office networking standard. Hundreds of those attending the conference sat in a huge auditorium with their portable computers wirelessly linked to the Internet via tiny PC cards plugged in to their machines.
10/19/2000	Apple Posts Results That Narrowly Miss Analysts' Estimates	Three weeks after warning investors that revenue would fall short of estimates, Apple Computer today announced quarterly earnings that narrowly missed even Wall Street's lowered estimates. Apple also sounded a new note of caution for the coming year, as it revised its earnings forecast for the current quarter and fiscal year. The computer maker's chief executive, Steven Jobs, announced a hiring freeze and said the company would cut prices on its newest offering, the cube-shaped PowerMac G4, which has failed to catch on the way the company expected.
10/19/2000	Office Renovated For Mac	MICROSOFT WORD 2001 for the Macintosh just came out this month, and as someone whose first choice for word processing is Word on a Mac, I am apprehensive. Like many writers, I still have fond memories of Word 5.1, which was released in the early 90's and was a straightforward, yet powerful word-processing program that didn't complicate the task of writing. I found the next version, Word 6.0, to be a wheezing, bloated mess of recycled Windows code that was confusing to use and took no advantage of the built-in elegance of the Macintosh operating system. I still have the 13 or so floppies that it came on, though, because they do make a nice set of matching coasters for parties.
10/12/2000	With New Office Suite for the Mac Microsoft Does More Than Windows	The Microsoft Corporation today released a new version of its popular Office suite for the Macintosh. This newest version underscores how the Macintosh market has continued to diverge from the mainstream of the PC world, because although it is similar to the Windows Office suite, it has some intriguing differences that relate to its history, and to the habits of the Macintosh faithful.
10/9/2000	Signs of Market Saturation in PC World	The personal computer industry, whose double-digit growth helped propel technology stocks for years, finally faces stiff competition -- from personal computers. Lately, it has become increasingly hard to sell consumers and corporations new computers because so many consumers and businesses already own them. Some analysts see signs of market saturation that could portend the end of the glory days for PC makers and their suppliers.
9/29/2000	Apple Says Quarterly Profit Won't Meet Expectations	Apple Computer said today that its fourth-quarter earnings would fall far below analysts' estimates because of weak September sales, an announcement that sent the company's shares plunging in after-hours trading. ''We've clearly hit a speed bump,'' said Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, adding that before investment gains, Apple would earn about $110 million rather than the expected $165 million for the quarter, which ends Sept. 30.
9/21/2000	Sit! Stay! Bark! Cut!	Computer makers, including Apple, Sony and Dell, are trying to spice up the market by providing digital video editing capabilities that can turn a passive computer user into a movie director; in addition, there is the new Lego Studios Steven Spielberg MovieMaker Set; lure of being able to tell personal stories by just cutting and pasting on a computer proves irresistible for some cosumers, but industry experts wonder how many people will actually make movies; photos (M)
9/21/2000	From Theory to Practice; Capturing Every Moment of That Saturday Soccer Match	IS it as easy as computer and video camera makers would have you think to edit a home movie on a computer? After spending a weekend making a short video of a youth soccer match, I can say that the definitive answer to that question is: yes and no.
9/21/2000	Mixing OS X and Microsoft	To the Editor: The new Mac operating system, Mac OS X, sounds impressive indeed (''Apple Breaks the Mold,'' Sept. 14). If Apple really wants to set the world on fire, it should produce a version of OS X that operates on Intel Pentium machines.
9/14/2000	Apple Breaks The Mold	THE last time Apple Computer introduced a fundamentally new operating system was in 1984, when System 1.0 was shipped with the original Macintosh computer. Ronald Reagan was president, Steve Jobs was the chairman of Apple, and consumers' embrace of Windows was still several years away. (In those days many computers ran on the DOS platform, which involved a lot of typed commands instead of pointing and clicking.) Since then, there have been upgrades and false starts, and Mr. Jobs has gone and returned. And yesterday, after years of waiting by the Macintosh faithful, Apple Computer released to the public a beta version of its Mac OS X (10) operating system software.
9/14/2000	Adventures in Beta Land; Aqua Everywhere: An Early Look at OS X	THE Mac OS X beta software comes neatly packaged from Apple inside a clean white folder with a big blue X on the front. Even though Apple says X should be pronounced ''10,'' the enigmatic appeal of the letter X seems vaguely more appropriate. X, after all, is the unknown -- and the unknown is both the joy and the curse of beta-ware. Following the documentation included with the Mac OS X CD-ROM, we installed a copy of the beta version of the Mac OS X onto a separate 9-gigabyte disk partition (akin to giving the OS a hard drive all its own) of a 400-megahertz iMac running Mac OS 9.0.4 with 128 megabytes of RAM. We were up and running in about 25 minutes.
8/31/2000	Classic Beauty, Cubed	COME away with me to my desert island, sort of a cross between ''Survivor'' and ''Fantasy Island.'' The fantasy comes into play in that the island would already have a Power Macintosh G4 Cube computer with a 15-inch flat-panel Studio Display, a set of Harman Kardon SoundSticks speakers and a fast Internet connection. Add to that just one luxury item, ''Survivor'' style, and that would be a copy of Culture 4.0, an endlessly fascinating CD-ROM from Cultural Resources. Culture 4.0 (www.culturalresources .com) is an ambitious Western civilization study guide for the Internet age, for adults as well as for students. It works with Windows computers as well as with Macs.
8/24/2000	A Long-Discontinued Macintosh Still Thrills Collectors to the Core	WHEN the subject is Macintosh, love often turns to obsession. Such is the case for a small group of Apple aficionados who have decided that the one true Macintosh is the Color Classic. As the last toaster-size Mac, the Color Classic followed the same basic design first offered in 1984 and was the only model to offer a built-in color display. Unveiled in 1993, the tiny all-in-one Classic disappeared from store shelves in 1994, but it still makes millions of brief appearances each day: the smiling icon that appears during every Mac start-up is a holdover from the Classic.
8/24/2000	APPLE TRADE-IN	Owners of the Apple PowerBook 5300 and 190 models can trade in their old computers for a significant discount on one of the company's 400-megahertz G3 laptops if they act quickly. From now until Aug. 31, Apple is offering $700 off the price of a new G3 PowerBook (usually $2,499) for those who choose to send their old 5300 or 190 models back to the company. The 5300/190 series, which was released in 1995, gained a measure of infamy because of a host of design and technical problems, and its overheating -- and occasionally combusting -- battery. Those interested in taking advantage of the offer should call Apple at (800) 767-2775. Although not so dramatic as bursting into flames, the discount seems a much safer way for the 5300/190 series to go out in a blaze of glory.
8/16/2000	APPLE NAMES A BOARD MEMBER	Apple Computer named Arthur D. Levinson, chairman of Genentech, to its board. Mr. Levinson, 51, became chief executive of Genentech in 1995 and chairman in 1999. He has a doctorate in biochemistry from Princeton University.
8/14/2000	Steven Jobs Finds Fault With Portrayal in Book	Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder and chief executive of Apple Computer, is not a happy man at the moment. Last week, Mr. Jobs called the chief executive of Random House, Peter Olson, to complain about a book the Broadway Books division is scheduled to publish in October, according to Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, a unit of Bertelsmann.
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: Yesterday I typed, ''Summertime and the living is easy,'' and my Microsoft Word for the Mac grammar checker corrected me (or should I say Ira?) to ''Summertime and the living are easy.'' I was wondering how to posthumously inform Mr. Gershwin of his error. LEWIS GOODMAN New York
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: The column about how a Mac fan survives in a Windows world seems to imply that there are no genealogy programs for the Mac. I have been using Reunion for several years on my Mac. I particularly like the ability to attach pictures and documents to individual names. KALMAN MILLER Somerset, N.J.
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: ''For Mac Users, Help From an Unlikely Quarter'' (State of the Art, Aug. 3) offered tips on Mac and Windows compatibility. You might want to know about an excellent Windows program, MacDrive 2000 by MediaFour, that sells for $59 and and will read Mac disks in Windows. It works with floppies, Zip disks and CD's. DR. MURRAY DAVID SCHANE New York
8/10/2000	Mixing Mac and Windows	To the Editor: J. D. Biersdorfer wrote, ''It's never easy living as a Mac user in a Windows world.'' Give me a break. Most of the software I use daily -- Digital Performer and Metasynth, for example -- is not even available on Windows. A lot of it has only recently been made available for Windows, like Media Cleaner, Pro Tools and Unity DS-1. I guess if you are slaving away in some cubicle, you may think you need Office whatever, but Apple Works does fine by me. Who needs Windows? WILLY DALTON Paterson, N.J.
8/3/2000	For Mac Users, Help From an Unlikely Quarter	IT'S never easy living as a Mac user in a Windows world, but it is a lot easier than it used to be. Microsoft, maker of Windows, was once thought to be Apple's greatest enemy. I will admit to referring to Microsoft as ''the Borg'' (taken from the dominating alien race on ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'') in those dark days of '97 when Apple's future looked shaky. But then things got better. Instead of trying to squash the Mac, Microsoft has actually spun off a unit to create Mac software from the ground up, instead of merely recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its programs. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.5 browser for the Mac featured many technogoodies, like a page-print preview option, that were not included in the concurrent Windows versions, and Internet Explorer 5 for Mac has even more.
7/24/2000	Warming Things Up, At Least Temporarily	It may not be ''Sex and the City,'' but relationships in the computer industry often run from frosty to passionate awfully quickly. Just look at that old yin-yang pair, Apple and Microsoft. In the Microsoft antitrust case, the longtime adversaries traded charges once more, depicting even their apparent armistice in 1997 as a kind of corporate hostage deal. Apple testified that Microsoft threatened to stop development of its popular Office suite for the Macintosh, unless Apple agreed to distribute Microsoft's browser. Microsoft replied that Apple was blackmailing it with a long-running patent dispute and paid it $150 million to stop the harassment.
7/20/2000	Apple's New Computer Goes Back to Square One	Steve Jobs officially unveiled the new PowerMac G4 Cube at Mac World Expo yesterday. But even before his speech, Mac fans, never shy in their ardor, couldn't contain themselves. The Cube -- the nickname that enthusiasts immediately gave the new computer -- is a 450-megahertz computer encased in an 8-inch cube. About one-quarter the size of the G4 computer that is currently on the market, the Cube sits in a clear plastic display case.
7/20/2000	Apple Redesigns Computers In Effort to Increase Sales	Apple Computer introduced a flurry of new products yesterday from a restyled mouse to an overhaul of its popular iMac desktop computers, whose sales have stagnated in recent months. Apple has enjoyed a remarkable corporate revival the last three years under the leadership of Steven P. Jobs, who returned to take the helm of the company he co-founded in 1975. But lately, industry analysts have pointed to signs that Apple's momentum may be slowing.
7/19/2000	Apple Reports Earnings Gain but Disappointing Sales	On the eve of its semiannual MacWorld trade show, Apple Computer today delivered mixed quarterly returns, with earnings exceeding analyst expectations but sales falling short of projections in light of disappointing sales of the iMac, the company's staple consumer computer. But Apple executives promised to introduce new products on Wednesday at MacWorld in New York that they suggested should spur sales.
7/18/2000	APPLE SLIPS, GATEWAY AND COMPAQ GAIN	Despite the success of its iMac model, Apple's Macintosh computers lost ground in American households last year, according to a survey being released today by Media Metrix, the Web market-tracking company. The Media Metrix survey shows that 3.8 million households owned Macs in January, compared with 4.1 million a year earlier and 4.9 million in 1996. In a separate survey, Media Metrix found that for the first time, Gateway and Compaq Computer are the leading brands of Windows PC's in homes in the United States, each in about 5.4 million homes, followed by the previous leader, Packard-Bell, with 5.2 million. Laurie J. Flynn
6/8/2000	Top Effie Award Goes to Apple	Apple Computer and its agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day in Playa del Rey, Calif., part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, won the top prize last night when the New York chapter of the American Marketing Association presented its 32nd annual Effie Awards, which recognize effectiveness in advertising. Apple and TBWA/Chiat/Day were awarded the Grand Effie for the ''Think different'' campaign, which also won a Gold Effie in the computer category. For the agency, it was the second consecutive year of winning the top prize, after being honored for work for the Taco Bell unit of Tricon Global Restaurants .
5/16/2000	Apple to Postpone Software Upgrade	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would release its widely anticipated new operating system software early next year and would use the edition coming out this summer as an additional test version. Apple had originally planned for the next version of the system, Mac OS X, to be the final edition, but the chief executive, Steve Jobs, said the next update would be a public preview ''beta version'' and the finished product would be introduced in January.
4/25/2000	U.S. Hoping 2 Microsoft Monopolies Are Gentler Than One	With its proposal for breaking up Microsoft, the government is betting that two monopolies, when no longer under the same corporate roof, will behave very differently than they do today -- and thus create a more open, competitive environment in the software industry. The essence of the Justice Department's tentative proposal, which is expected to be submitted to a federal judge later this week, would be to force the Microsoft Corporation to break off its industry-standard Windows operating system into one company, and its Office applications software business and most other operations into a second company.
4/20/2000	Apple Reports Big Profits and 2-for-1 Split	Apple Computer reported earnings today that handily beat analysts' estimates for its second fiscal quarter. In contrast to the slowing sales for many PC makers, Apple reported strong demand across its product lines. Not counting a one-time gain from a stock sale, Apple reported earnings per share of 88 cents. Analysts had expected 81 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Apple also beat the so-called whisper number of 87 cents.
4/13/2000	My Life, My Laptop	To the Editor: It seems that Peter H. Lewis, in his review of the Apple Powerbook G3 portable Macintosh computer, has fallen for that old Intel trick that more megahertz means a more powerful machine when he mentions that a new 650-megahertz Pentium III is faster than the G3 sitting on his lap.
4/13/2000	My Life, My Laptop	To the Editor: In the laptop review by Peter H. Lewis, he mentioned Intel's SpeedStep processor technology, which slows the computer to conserve battery power. The G3 laptops have similar options. In the Energy Saver control panel, there are options to allow processor cycling, to turn off the power to inactive PC cards and to reduce the processor speed. RICK SPIES Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
4/6/2000	Laptops of Luxury, When Price Is an Afterthought	WHY is this man smiling? Here he is, stuck in the middle seat between two large people in the third-to-last row of coach on a bumpy, 1,500-mile, early Sunday morning flight. But all is well, because the Apple PowerBook G3 portable Macintosh computer I'm testing has a gorgeous, 14-inch, high-resolution screen, a DVD drive and ample battery life to show a full-length movie.
3/9/2000	Mac Users Can Now Say 'I Love You' Out Loud	Not only are some of the major video game makers coming back to the revitalized Macintosh platform, but productivity software is also appearing on the once-dusty store shelves in the Mac section. I.B.M.'s ViaVoice for Mac software, a continuous speech recognition program, allows members of the Apple corps to freely dictate their thoughts and have the computer do the typing. Continuous speech recognition programs, those that allow the user to speak in natural rhythms and not pause uncomfortably after every word, have been making the lives (and hands) of PC users less stressed for years, but a similar product for the Mac was not available until the ViaVoice program was released a few months ago. A version of the program is also available for PC users.
2/21/2000	Building an Alternative to Windows	The Beatles never got back together, but four members of the original Apple Macintosh team are regrouping. And they mean to take the best of the quirky Apple computer and move it to the world of Linux software. Andy Hertzfeld, Mike Boich, Susan Kare and Guy Tribble are busy trying to recreate the innovative tone originally set by Apple Computer's founder, Steven Jobs, when he led a band of renegades to design the Macintosh in the early 1980's.
2/20/2000	Janus Capital Likes Apple	The Janus Capital Corporation, the white-hot mutual fund group, said it had raised its stake in Apple Computer to 9.99 million shares, or 6.1 percent of the computer maker's stock, as of the end of 1999. Janus owned about 5.83 million shares, or 3.6 percent of Apple's shares, as of Sept. 30. Still, Janus, which disclosed its increased holdings last week in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is only the second-largest institutional holder of Apple shares, behind AIM Advisors.
2/17/2000	In Japan, Apple Unveils New Items and Upgrades	Apple made no new-hardware announcements at its big Macworld computer show in San Francisco last month, but it made up for the lapse in Japan yesterday when it unveiled new and upgraded versions of its PowerMac, PowerBook and iBook product lines. Seeking to capitalize on the surprising success of the graphite-colored iMac Special Edition desktop computer that it introduced late last year, Apple introduced a special edition of its iBook notebook. But aside from a new color scheme and a modest increase in processing power, the new iBook SE is not as special as its desktop counterpart, whose appeal included more memory, a bigger hard disk and a DVD drive.
2/16/2000	Apple Introduces New Computers	Apple Computer announced a series of new portable and desktop computers in Tokyo today including a translucent graphite-colored version of its consumer iBook portable. The new model of the iBook will sell for $1,799 and have a faster 366 MHz processor. The existing 300 MHz models will have more memory and larger disk drives and continue to sell for $1,599.
1/27/2000	Apple Stakes Web Claim	GET ready to be served in a big way by the companies that make personal computer operating system software. Apple Computer and the Microsoft Corporation have been making frequent references lately to services they will provide to their clients (that's you, if you use either Mac OS 9 or the forthcoming Windows 2000) via the Internet. Apple unveiled the first four of its new Internet-based services, called iTools, this month on its redesigned Web site, www.apple.com. These inaugural iTools and their companion services, iCards and iReview, give a glimpse of the potential ways such services will change the way people use personal computers.
1/20/2000	Apple Chief Rewarded for Company's First-Quarter Results	Apple Computer Inc. once again handily surpassed analysts' estimates for its first quarter, and a grateful board thanked its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, for the company's turnaround by giving him a Gulfstream V jet and 10 million stock options. Mr. Jobs's options for Apple's common stock were awarded at last week's closing price of $98.99, but he will continue to receive a token salary of just $1 a year. After returning to a struggling Apple two and a half years ago, Mr. Jobs called himself the interim chief executive until earlier this month.
1/16/2000	Reckonings; Master of the Game	So Bill Gates is stepping down -- or up, or sideways, or something -- from his position as C.E.O. of Microsoft. Nobody seems to think that this will make much difference either to the way Microsoft is run or to the desire of the Justice Department to break up the world's most valuable company and humble its founder. But maybe the announcement provides a good occasion to reflect on the achievements of this elder statesman (44 years old!) of the New Economy. You might say that Mr. Gates is to business strategy what Heinz Guderian, the father of the blitzkrieg, was to military strategy. Germany didn't invent the tank or the bomber; but the German command understood, in a way that the British or the French did not, how these inventions changed the nature of war, and very nearly ended up conquering the world. Microsoft didn't invent either the personal computer or the point-and-click interface; but Mr. Gates understood, in a way that other contenders for empire did not, how these inventions changed the nature of business competition, and some think that he has come equally close to global conquest.
11/25/1999	PC's Are Adopting New Shapes, One Just a Bit Too Familiar	After Apple's iMac broke the ''any color as long as it's beige'' and ''any shape as long as it's a box'' molds, personal computer makers have been showing off odd-shaped and colorful computers. There were a spate of them at Comdex, the big computer industry trade show, in Las Vegas last week. Advanced Micro Devices was showing a new design, called EasyNow, which looks like the cross-section of a football and features a flip-top CD drive. PC manufacturers are starting to produce systems based on the design, under license from AMD.
11/25/1999	Not Born To Be Wired	WHEN Apple introduced the iBook several months ago as the portable version of its popular iMac desktop computer, one of its more intriguing features was a built-in radio antenna that in theory enabled the iBook to connect to the Internet and share files with other Macintosh computers without wires. But like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project, which scans radio emissions coming from deep space for patterns that might indicate alien intelligence, and perhaps even explain the Pokemon phenomenon, the antenna in my iBook picked up only static.
10/28/1999	The Blind Leading the Sighted	GREGG VANDERHEIDEN regularly washes his own clothes, but unlike most people, he never loses any socks. He is immune to that modern plague because he uses sock sorters, small plastic rings that keep each pair together in the laundry. ''I haven't had a mismatched or incomplete pair in years,'' Mr. Vanderheiden said.
10/21/1999	Flavors Are the Same, but New iMacs Have Some Spice	THE bubble-like, blue-and-white iMac was a classic from the day it was born. Apple has now come up with a born-again iMac that is so good it even has a glowing halo built into its new design. There are three new models, ranging in price from $999 to $1,499. All still suffer from some of the original sins of the first iMac -- the lack of a removable storage drive, a relatively small 15-inch screen and a clumsy mouse -- but they are redeemed by an impressive array of advanced features not found on any other home computer.
10/14/1999	Apple Posts Quarter Results That Exceed Predictions	After warning last month of an earnings shortfall, Apple Computer Inc. today reported results for its fourth quarter that exceeded Wall Street analysts' revised estimates. Apple executives also predicted strong sales for the December quarter. Apple said it had been able to ship only 6,000 of its new iBook laptops, which were announced in July, because of production delays caused by the Taiwan earthquake. Apple executives said they expected no material impact from the earthquake in the December quarter.
10/11/1999	Unsung Success in Revamping Software Holds a Clue to the Turnaround at Apple	Much has been said and written about the turnaround at Apple Computer in recent years, as measured by its return to profitability, the resurgence of its share price and the explosive sales of its fruit-colored iMac machines. But in fact, the seeds of Apple's remarkable renaissance were sown in a contentious meeting that took place here in January 1997 and that involved the unsung part of Apple's business: software. The meeting was held only days after Apple's chairman at the time, Gilbert F. Amelio, purchased Steven P. Jobs's Next Computer. And Next's chief software designer, Avidis Tevanian Jr., was huddling for the first time with Apple's top engineers. The session, according to several people who participated, escalated into a shouting match between Mr. Tevanian and the head of Copland -- Apple's troubled effort to create a next-generation operating system.
10/7/1999	New iMac Offers More Than a Choice of Colors	With its announcement of new models this week, Apple has significantly redesigned and improved the iMac, a popular computer for home and school users. Breaking with its original philosophy of making only one version of the iMac -- the hard part for buyers was choosing the color -- Apple has created three models. All have features that makers of Windows-based computers are probably already scrambling to try to copy.
10/6/1999	Apple Computer Rolls Out New Assemblage of iMacs	Apple Computer Inc. announced a new family of its iMac computers today, including an entry-level model priced below $1,000. Timing the introduction to build demand heading into the Christmas quarter, Apple described several new features aimed at home buyers.
9/24/1999	Stocks Plunge Over Remark On Microsoft	Stock prices, already weighed down by fears about interest rates and the dollar, fell hard yesterday after the president of Microsoft said high-technology companies like his were considerably overvalued. A session in which most prices were meandering lower was quickly transformed into a steep decline, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq market absorbing a loss of 3.79 percent, its biggest since April. The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 205.48 points, or 1.95 percent, closed at 10,318.59. That put it more than 1,000 points below its record set on Aug. 25.
9/21/1999	Apple Says Shortage of Chips Will Weaken Results for Quarter	In the first setback for Apple Computer Inc. since the return of the company's co-founder Steven P. Jobs two years ago, the company said today that shipments, revenue and earnings for the current quarter would fall short of expectations because of smaller-than-expected deliveries of microprocessors from Motorola Inc. Apple made the announcement after the market had closed. But the warning sent Apple's share price down almost 10 points in after-hours trading this evening. After rising $2.125, to $79.0625 -- within pennies of its high -- in regular Nasdaq trading, Apple dropped quickly to $69.875 after the warning was issued.
9/13/1999	I.B.M. to Introduce New Server for Unix	I.B.M. plans to introduce a new server today, the RS/6000 S80, which it says will offer the highest performance of any computer running the Unix operating system. The company will also introduce a new so-called thin-client desktop terminal called the B50, powered by the Power PC chip that I.B.M. developed with Motorola and Apple Computer.
9/9/1999	A New Stylish Carrying Case For iMac Users on the Go	Way back in 1984, Apple's brochure for the first Macintosh featured the no-bigger-than-a-breadbox computer in various smart poses all over the verdant Stanford University campus. But with today's popular iMac at 38 pounds, hauling it down to the quadrangle would cause even sports scholars to break a sweat. A company called Grabpac (www.grab pac.com) hopes to ease the strain with a wraparound carry case that slips and snaps into place, much like the tight-fitting car bras designed to protect the front ends of Camaros and Corvettes. The form-and-fashion accessory comes in gray, teal or black and sells for $59.95. It cleverly manages to integrate a mouse pad into the keyboard flap, which folds up against the monitor's glass face to protect it from minor bumps and scratches. Pockets on either side give shelter to the mouse, a disk drive and a bottle of aspirin, in the event of a sore shoulder.
9/9/1999	Where the Help Desk Goes for Good Advice	MAC OBSERVER www.macobserver.com FOR Macintosh addicts, one of the most energetic geek sites on the Web is the Mac Observer, which is updated several times a day. The site is a full-service on-line magazine, with news reports, original stories, opinionated columnists and editorials that celebrate, cogitate and occasionally berate Apple Computer's creations.
9/9/1999	Where the Help Desk Goes for Good Advice	MACINTOUCH www.macintouch.com CREATED by Ric Ford in 1994, the Macintouch site provides Macintosh users with insightful, timely technical information about their cherished platform. While many geek Web sites offer fancy graphics, the Macintouch site is positively plain: mostly just black type on a white background.
9/2/1999	Apple Is Now the Champ In Computer Speed Wars	Apple Computer humbled the rest of the personal computer industry this week by introducing a new desktop machine based on the Motorola Power PC G4 processor, which Apple calls ''a supercomputer on a chip.'' Using the Intel Corporation's own benchmark software, a 500-megahertz G4 Macintosh simply smoked the fastest chip in Intel's PC lineup, the Pentium III. Intel countered by announcing that its long-awaited Coppermine Pentium III processor, operating at a minimum speed of 700 MHz, will be available in new PC's by the end of October. Coppermine is a code name for Intel's new chip manufacturing process, which packs all the circuitry of a Pentium III chip into a much smaller package. The result is a chip that runs faster.
9/1/1999	Early, Apple Shows Off New Mac G4	A buoyant Steven P. Jobs, the interim chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., introduced the latest, most powerful Macintosh today, describing it as a supercomputer for the desktop. The new Macs, the G4 series, were not expected until next year, but Mr. Jobs, who demonstrated the machines at the Seybold Publishing Conference here, said shipments of them began today. Although they are substantially more powerful than the G3 series they replace, their price increments are the same: $1,599 for a Mac with a 400-megahertz processor, available immediately; $2,499 for 450 MHz, available in September, and $3,499 for 500 MHz, available in October.
8/27/1999	Saudi Prince Discloses Bearish Outlook	Prince Walid bin Talal, the Saudi Arabian billionaire who is the biggest individual shareholder of Citigroup Inc. and Apple Computer Inc., says United States stocks are so expensive that he would not make any new investments for the foreseeable future. Prince Walid, 42, who estimates his fortune at $14.5 billion, said he expected a significant decline in stocks and would wait until it occurs before buying a large stake in any company in the world.
8/24/1999	An Old-Fashioned Brawl Among Options Exchanges	Facing new challenges from electronic trading systems and regulatory inquiries into anticompetitive practices, the nation's leading options exchanges opted today for an old-fashioned market brawl. The Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock Exchange fired the opening salvo this morning by listing options of the Dell Computer Corporation, which for years had been traded exclusively on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The two won huge market share on the first day of trading.
8/19/1999	Windows In iMac Clothing	BACK in college, a classmate turned in a writing assignment that was almost identical to a short story written years earlier by Ray Bradbury. Only the characters' names and some minor details had been changed. The instructor suggested that the work was dangerously close to plagiarism. ''It's not plagiarism,'' the student declared defiantly. ''It's homage.'' The response itself was too good to have been original. And the same might be said for the new eOne computer from Emachines, which is, shall we say, a very good homage to Apple Computer's popular iMac. Only the operating system and some minor details are different. And, oh yes, the price: The eOne went on sale last week at Circuit City for $799, about $400 less than the iMac.
8/12/1999	New E-Gadgets, Dressed Like iMacs	If you are one of those PC users who is green with envy over the iMac's teal shell, don't fret. Marketing experts around the world are not about to miss the Bondi Blue wave. One example is the E-Power, a PC that looks remarkably like the iMac, with a curved monitor, translucent blue sides and curved grips on the top for portability. The computer comes with Windows software, built-in speakers, a 15-inch monitor, a Celeron chip with speeds up to 500 megahertz, a 56K modem and a CD-ROM drive. Future Power, the American company that plans to sell the computers in September for $799 each, says that it did not copy Apple's design. The company's designers chose to create the E-Power, said Priscilla Lynn, Future Power's marketing manager, ''because of the trend in the market.''
8/5/1999	Reading Mac Disks On Windows Machines	A few years ago, when Brian Landwehr was trying to sell software that enabled PC's to read Macintosh floppy disks, people probably thought he was crazy. Here was a product based on two technologies that surely would soon vanish: Apple computers and floppy diskettes. A few years later, Apple has resurged, floppies are still around and Mr. Landwehr has a new version of his product called MacDrive 98 Version 3. ''Trading files via removable media isn't going away any time soon,'' he said.
8/3/1999	Start-Up Offering iMac's to Lure Customers	A Los Angeles-based start-up company said today that beginning next month it intended to give away one million of Apple Computer Inc.'s popular iMacs to customers who sign up for its Internet service. The news briefly sent Apple shares to a new 52-week high, but they had settled back by the close of the market. The start-up, Freemac.com, said it would give away iMacs to customers who qualified for a Freemac-brand Visa card and agreed to pay $19.95 a month for three years for Internet service. Freemac said it was a partner with Earthlink Network, a major Internet service provider; First USA, the Visa and Mastercard issuing subsidiary of the Bank One Corporation; Cybercash, an electronic commerce company, and Peter Max, the 1960's pop artist, who will serve as spokesman and ''chief creativity officer.''
8/1/1999	Behind the Apple Of Many Eyes	Apple Computer's iBook, introduced two weeks ago, has a high ''ooooh'' factor -- the involuntary reaction elicited from some people when they see a thoughtfully designed product. The person mainly responsible is Jonathan Ive, 32, a London native who is the personal-computer industry's leading design rebel. To Mr. Ive, Apple's design director, the term ''generic'' is a derogatory epithet, and he calls generic design (think beige box) ''the curse of computing.''
7/29/1999	More Gadgets For Macs	THE Mac is back. Apple Computer Inc., which was nearly given up for dead a year ago, has emerged as the most innovative and aggressive personal computer maker in the industry. Apple has sold nearly two million colorful iMac computers in the last 11 months, and it asserts that nearly half of those went to first-time computer buyers or people who were returning to the Mac after being seduced by cheaper but more complicated PC's based on the dominant Windows operating system. Apple filled the last gaping hole in its product line last week at the Macworld trade show in New York, introducing a low-cost portable iMac computer called the iBook. Particularly intriguing was the iBook's optional Airport wireless networking system.
7/29/1999	It Looks Like What?	To the Editor: Why on earth did ''Apple Shrinks Its iMac to Size of a Notebook'' (News Watch, July 22) choose to describe Apple's new iBook as ''shaped vaguely like a toilet seat''? If the remark was unflattering but true, I'd bite my tongue and live with it, my Mac loyalties notwithstanding. But the glaring ineptitude of the description makes me wonder. Aren't most toilet seats wider toward the hinge? Is the resemblance to a clamshell so hard to spot? Is the power of analogy lost in tech writing? BEN SHIN New York City, July 22, 1999
7/22/1999	Apple Offers iMac's Laptop Offspring, the iBook	With its corporate comeback gaining momentum, Apple Computer Inc. introduced a powerful notebook computer yesterday intended for the consumer market -- a machine that breaks new ground in the personal computer industry for both its industrial design and its use of wireless technology. The housing of the shell-shaped laptop computer, called iBook, combines translucent white plastic with rubber sheathing in either of two colors -- blue or tangerine orange. In being colorful, the new notebook echoes Apple's popular iMac desktop model, introduced last August, which comes in five colors. And like the iMac, the Apple iBook has been designed to be easy to use and to get access to the Internet.
7/22/1999	Apple Shrinks Its iMac To Size of a Notebook	How can Apple Computer top the phenomenal success of the iMac? With an iMac to go, Apple's chief executive, Steve Jobs, said yesterday at the Macworld trade show in New York City. The new iBook portable Macintosh, which will cost $1,599 when it goes on sale in September, continues Apple's recent string of impressive, innovative and colorful consumer computers.
7/22/1999	Living the 8-Bit Dream in a 32-Bit World	AS a mathematician at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Steve Judd harnesses the power of Unix work stations and Cray supercomputers to detect and prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. When he goes home, he basks in the light of his 15-year-old Commodore computer, a one-megahertz machine with 64 kilobytes of RAM. It can move chunks of data in the same size packages as a Nintendo Game Boy and has 3 percent of the memory capacity of a Palm III organizer.
7/15/1999	Apple Reports Strong Third-Quarter Sales	Buoyed by impressive sales of its iMac consumer machine, Apple Computer said today that it had earned $114 million in its fiscal third quarter. The results were 5 cents stronger than the 64 cents a share that analysts had expected, according to the First Call Corporation. That was the seventh consecutive quarter the computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., has been profitable under a turnaround executed by the company's co-founder and acting chief executive, Steven P. Jobs.
7/8/1999	Computer Shock	To the Editor: I am a 14-year-old student at Exeter High School in New Hampshire. It is known that for beginners, Windows computers are somewhat difficult to use. However, a Macintosh computer would have been much easier for Dr. Edwin Rothman to use (''Agony, Ecstasy, Agony: Enter the Computer,'' July 1). If people are completely against Macintosh, I'd recommend Web TV, a Gateway computer or some other easy-to-set-up, color-coded-wire device. JAMES FERGUSON Exeter, N.H., July 2, 1999
7/8/1999	Computer Shock	To the Editor: ''Agony, Ecstasy, Agony: Enter the Computer'' (July 1) was a great essay, but it should have ended on this note: ''I should have bought an iMac.''
7/8/1999	Computer Shock	To the Editor: If Dr. Edwin Rothman (''Agony, Ecstasy, Agony: Enter the Computer,'' July 1) had purchased a Mac and had been set up with a server, he could have been on line on Monday, May 17, without problems! WILLIS A. SMITH Naples, Fla., July 2, 1999
6/24/1999	Quicktime's Virtues	To the Editor: I could not fathom your News Watch item on the release of Quicktime 4 from Apple (''High-Quality Playback From Apple Computer,'' June 17). After very briefly mentioning the features of Quicktime 4, the article devoted three times as many paragraphs to jokes about problems with the beta release version, which was just that -- a beta release version. The average reader comes away from that item associating Quicktime 4 with bugs and bombs instead of learning that the final version is a stable application with amazing streaming video and audio features, the ability to recognize nearly 100 different digital audio and video formats and a stunning musical instrument synthesizer.
6/24/1999	Credit for Macintosh	To the Editor: While the new NEC Packard Bell machine is certainly nice looking (''Thinking Outside the Beige Box,'' June 17), you omitted any mention of the first nonbeige integrated flat-screen-computer combo: Apple's 20th Anniversary Macintosh, which combined a 200-megahertz 603e processor (hot stuff at the time) with an LCD panel display, 32 megabytes of RAM and very high-quality speakers. It was overpriced and underpowered, even compared with its siblings in Apple's product line, but it was a fine piece of design. PAUL ROBICHAUX Huntsville, Ala., June 17, 1999
6/24/1999	Pitfalls of Office 2000	To the Editor: Was ''Office 2000 Is Well Connected'' (June 10) supposed to be a review of Office 2000? There are glaring problems with the 97/98 (Windows and Mac) versions of the software suite: weird corrections like capitalizing letters, automatic outlining that doesn't quite work, inaccurate rendering of HTML with tables, Powerpoint's lack of layout flexibility. So what about Office 2000? Your reviewer doesn't really address whether these problems still exist, but one has suspicions. And what about the competitors, mentioned in the last sentence of the article? Does Word Perfect even exist any more? Are there other competitors of note?
6/24/1999	Apple Aid for Refugees	To the Editor: I was pleased to see coverage of how the Kosovo refugees at Fort Dix, N.J., are using the Internet to search for information on lost relatives (''For Kosovo's Scattered Refugees, the Internet Is a Lifeline,'' June 10). One detail that was missing from the article was that the 12 computers at Fort Dix were iMacs, donated by Apple Computer. But I wonder why it was that Apple responded to those refugees' need and not the other, much larger personal computer makers? Too bad more computer makers don't ''Think Different.'' SUSAN M. SANDERSON Basking Ridge, N.J., June 14, 1999
6/20/1999	When Cyberspace Was a State of Mind	In 1996, when TNT first approached him about doing a television movie on the history of the personal computer industry, Martyn Burke brushed off the suggestion. ''I told them I'd rather do a history of cornflakes,'' recalled Mr. Burke, a screenwriter, novelist and documentary filmmaker. A rich history perhaps, he figured, but how do you tell a technology story to a mainstream audience? No life-and-death drama, no love story and far too much nerdish widgetry to slog through.
6/18/1999	A Couple of Nerds Trying to Take Over the World	The swashbuckling title ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is absolutely right for a film about the birth of the computer age. After all, the tale of the battle for dominance between Apple Computers and Microsoft is brimming with those age-old elements of high drama: invention, big bucks and backbiting. Apple's founder, Steve Jobs (savvily played by Noah Wyle), is the visionary and rebel here, as comfortable with cosmic consciousness as bytes of information. ''It's better to be a pirate than to run the navy,'' he tells his employees.
6/17/1999	Thinking Outside the Beige Box; The iMac May Have Put the Focus on Design But Flat Screens Are Inspiring PC Shapes	IF the millions of desktop computers in the world could be stacked into a great wall, the resulting construction might resemble some enormous Louise Nevelson sculpture dominated by one oppressive shape: the box. The BUB, the computer industry's self-mocking acronym for Big Ugly Box, has ruled computer design for years. Now a wave of design innovation, or imitation, is cresting at personal computer companies looking for a way to break out of the box.
6/17/1999	High-Quality Playback From Apple Computer	Apple Computer last week officially released Quicktime 4, the latest version of its multimedia software for Windows and Macintosh systems. Quicktime 4 (which can be downloaded from www.apple.com/quicktime) offers high-quality playback for both streaming and stored video and audio files, a component that can display video and image files in a wide variety of formats, and support for MP3 and other compression technologies. Unfortunately, the launching wasn't always as smooth as well-streamed video. Apple unveiled a beta version on April 19, the work-in-progress release of a program that allows the company to get plenty of time-saving bug reports and comments from unpaid testers. As is the case with beta software, however, bugs and bombs were not uncommon. Ric Ford's Macintouch page (www.macintouch.com) began posting user feedback on the software a few months ago, and Apple also maintains a lively message board and tech-tip exchange on its site. Perhaps the biggest bait for the beta testers was the high-quality version of the ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' Web trailer, exclusively in the Quicktime 4 format. Apple reports that 6.25 million copies of Quicktime 4.0 have been downloaded since the beta version was made available. Users were not shy about posting reports of system glitches they were enduring after installing the beta version, including unexplained crashes and problems that spread to other programs, causing some to believe that maybe the Quicktime 4 beta version itself was a phantom menace. The final release of Quicktime 4 came out on June 8. ''The good thing was, we didn't find many bugs that would be considered show-stoppers by any software company on the planet,'' said Frank Casanova, the director of Quicktime product marketing. ''Of course, software is never finished. It's done, but it's never finished.'' J. D. BIERSDORFER
5/31/1999	Hip Joins Hip With Little Ado	Think different. Dress casual. Whatever. The culture of khaki joined the colorful world of the iMac computer last week, when Millard S. Drexler, president and chief executive of Gap Inc., joined the board of Apple Computer Inc.
5/13/1999	Color Printers In Color	ONE of the advantages of ugly, boring computers is that they look relatively good when attached to ugly, boring peripherals, like printers. So when Apple Computer introduced its boldly fruit-colored line of iMac and G3 computers last year, it brightened millions of desktops but also called attention to the homeliness of most other peripherals in its general vicinity. Epson to the rescue. The company has just introduced a fruit-colored ink-jet printer, the Color Stylus 740i, which becomes the first -- and so far the only -- printer designed to match the iMac and Power Macintosh G3 color schemes. The printer costs $279, but has a $30 mail-in rebate.
5/12/1999	I.B.M. to Make Game Part For Nintendo	Underscoring the growing significance of inexpensive video game machines in the computer industry, the International Business Machines Corporation and Nintendo Inc. plan to announce today a $1 billion agreement for Nintendo to build its next-generation system with I.B.M.'s PowerPC processors. Until now, the PowerPC chip has been best known as the processor that powers the Macintosh line of computers from Apple Computer Inc. The deal is something of a coup for I.B.M., which will gain a coveted foothold in a booming market being fiercely contested by three Japanese giants -- Nintendo, the Sony Corporation and Sega Enterprises.
5/11/1999	Apple Offers Thinner Types Of Portables	A resurgent Apple Computer introduced a new lighter Powerbook today that the company maintained would permit it to retain its performance lead over the larger Intel-based computing world. The company's co-founder and interim chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, announced two new models at the company's annual development conference, which began here today.
4/26/1999	Apple and PC's, Both Given Up for Dead, Are Rising Anew	Ask Jon Rubinstein, the man in charge of hardware at Apple Computer Inc., about the supposedly imminent ''post-PC era,'' and he answers like someone who works for Microsoft or Intel, the twin pillars of the personal computer industry, rather for than this quirky California computer maker. For though it has become fashionable to say that the PC era is waning and the future of computing lies in a burgeoning assortment of wired and wireless hand-held consumer electronics gizmos, Mr. Rubinstein is still a true believer in powerful, full-featured personal computers.
4/22/1999	PC vs. iMac: The Grass Is Always Greener Across the Divide	I'M conflicted. The iMac is a sensation, with more than a million units sold since its release last August. And like a lot of former Mac users who had made the switch to a Windows 98 PC, I have found myself drawn, even taunted by the iMac's cool esthetic. It has conjured up that old Apple magic for me, that self-righteous promise of a better-built mousetrap that not only compelled me to use Apple computers once but also prompted me to move west and go to work for the company. I bought an iMac the day it went on sale and yet, as I revise this article on a Windows 98 personal computer, I wonder if that magic is enough to pull me back for good.
4/20/1999	Apple Media Software Challenges 2 Rivals	In a direct challenge to both the Microsoft Corporation and Real Networks Inc., Apple Computer today introduced a new version of its Quicktime multimedia software designed to permit computer users to receive video and audio programming over the Internet. The distribution of multimedia material is emerging as one of the hottest businesses on the Internet. Last week in Hollywood, Microsoft announced its own technology in the field, known as MS Audio 4.0, and the International Business Machines Corporation and Sony Inc. announced an agreement to make their competing systems compatible with each other.
4/15/1999	Apple, Against the Grain, Reports Strong 2d Quarter	Reporting its second-quarter earnings today, a resurgent Apple Computer Inc. again beat analysts' earnings estimates. Apple said strong demand for its iMac and G3 machines increased unit sales by 27 percent, or nearly twice the industry average. Apple's renewed fortunes are all the more striking at a time when the rest of the personal computer industry is mired in price wars and slowing growth. Last week the Compaq Computer Corporation, the world's largest PC manufacturer, warned that earnings for the current quarter would fall far short of estimates, and on Tuesday the Intel Corporation said sales for its first quarter were slower than expected.

4/1/1999	Grolier Interactive Presents Color-Coordinated Software	With hardware vendors scrambling to create stylish peripherals to complement Apple Computer's trendy translucent iMac, it was probably only a matter of time before software manufacturers followed suit. Grolier Interactive has just created a special edition of its popular multimedia encyclopedia CD-ROM that is specifically tailored for iMac users. The 1999 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia Deluxe 2-CD iMac Edition not only offers users a program interface that nicely matches the original iMac's Bondi Blue case color, but it also has been enhanced to take advantage of the machine's advanced video and stereo capabilities. The two-disk set contains 36,000 articles, 15,000 pictures and graphics, and 1,200 maps, plus video and digitally remastered sound clips. In addition, 22,000 articles are available through on-line access to two more encyclopedias.
3/17/1999	Apple Adopts 'Open Source' Code Strategy	The ''open source'' software movement won a vote of confidence today from yet another major computer maker as Apple Computer released an open source operating system for the server computers that connect desktop and laptop machines across a business or to the Internet. The company said its Mac OS X Server would position Apple to compete in the hot market for small servers priced below $5,000, a market now dominated by Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and I.B.M.
3/11/1999	G3: Blue and White and Different All Over, Except the Name	THE official name of Apple's most powerful and most stylish Macintosh is the Power Macintosh G3. Apple Computer, which has been creative in so many other ways recently and whose current motto is ''Think Different,'' was apparently thinking undifferent that day and merely recycled the name from an earlier, uglier model also known as the Power Macintosh G3. Fortunately, Apple's loyal customers quickly dubbed the new machine the G3 Blue and White, in an attempt to distinguish this innovative new desktop machine from its boring, beige and boxy G3 predecessor, which has been discontinued.
3/4/1999	New Program Is Introduced To Ease Use of Linux System	The free software movement today took its most significant step yet toward a direct confrontation with the Microsoft Corporation by introducing software that gives the powerful and free Linux operating system the ease-of-use found on Windows and Macintosh computers. The program, which is known as Gnome, for GNU Network Object Model Environment, was introduced here at the first Linux World computer exhibition. Its designers said that Gnome would make it possible for people who are not programmers or technicians to use Linux and the software that runs on it comfortably.
1/26/1999	At Microsoft Trial, Accounts Differ on Dealings With Apple	The Justice Department's lead lawyer in the Microsoft antitrust case clashed today with the company's highest-ranking witness as the Government charged that the software maker had used its market power as ''a club'' in its dealings with Apple Computer Inc., while the Microsoft executive countered that his company was responding to a threat of ''patent terrorism'' from Apple. The conflicting accounts of how Microsoft convinced Apple to make Microsoft's Internet software the preferred choice over that of its browser rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation, was the main focus of the Government's early cross-examination of Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, who took the stand this afternoon.
1/14/1999	Apple Reports Earnings Gain That Beat The Estimates	A resurgent Apple Computer Inc. today reported its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. Excluding a one-time gain, Apple earnings exceeded Wall Street estimates by more than 10 percent. Apple's unit sales grew by 49 percent in the quarter, year-over-year, several times the average for the personal computer industry. Apple sold 519,000 of its translucent teal iMac's in the quarter, fewer than the most optimistic analysts' forecasts, but a huge number for any single computer model by any other measure. Apple also had strong sales of its G3 Macintosh machines, aimed primarily at professionals, even as these beige boxes are phased out for a new line.
1/7/1999	Apple Shows Its Colors	In a barrage of introductions that blended technological prowess with a delightful sense of style and fun, Apple Computer this week introduced a powerful new line of desktop computer systems in a color scheme it calls translucent blueberry and ice, as well as an array of improved iMac computers that come in an assortment of colors including blueberry, grape, lime, tangerine and strawberry. Although translucent blueberry is its major color theme, Apple is clearly not singing the blues any more. At the Macworld Expo trade show here, Apple disclosed that it is in the black for the fifth consecutive quarter after a disastrous two-year stretch that nearly pushed the fabled Silicon Valley company into irrelevance.
1/6/1999	New iMac's Are Introduced Along With $100 Price Cut	Unveiling a colorful array of sleek machines that more closely resemble a pack of Life Savers than a new computer line, Apple Computer's interim chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, today introduced the second generation of the company's popular iMac computers. Mr. Jobs told an overflow crowd of almost 5,000 at the annual Macworld computer exhibition here at the Moscone Convention Center that color and fashion would increasingly become more important than measures of megabytes and megahertz that have traditionally attracted computer buyers.
12/24/1998	Apple's Store on the Web Is Closed for Renovations	It was the week before Christmas, and all through North America consumers were snatching up Apple Macintosh computers as fast as Apple could make them. So why, then, did Apple close its on-line store for the holidays? The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., earlier this year brazenly vowed to teach Michael Dell a thing or two about selling computers over the Internet. But it has been herding potential customers away from its Web operations (www.store.apple.com) in recent weeks, at the height of the busiest sales time of the year. And then, this week, visitors to the Apple Store were greeted with a notice that the site would be closed for renovations until Jan. 5. (Apple executives did not respond to requests for comment.)
12/17/1998	Rumor Mill Churns Overtime About New Apple Portable	Apple Computer has been officially tight-lipped about rumors it will soon release a new portable computer along the lines of its translucent blue iMac. While the company has said it plans one, Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, said pointedly last week that no such portable would be unveiled in January at the Mac World trade show in San Francisco.
12/17/1998	Behind iMac's Popularity	To the Editor: In ''Go Cheap or Buy the Best?'' (Dec. 10), the article gives a number of reasons why the Apple iMac has been the most popular personal computer sold in computer stores each month since its introduction. But the article missed the most obvious reason of all.
12/10/1998	I'll Always Love You, but Is It Time to Move On?	DURING the long months of my first pregnancy, I exhibited the usual range of tender maternal feelings. As I lay awake at night, I hoped that my daughter would be born healthy, with my husband's hair and with a strong aversion to dating boys who rode motorcycles. But when I went into labor, I forgot such trivial concerns. Between contractions, I was seized by a bizarre, urgent thought: I needed to find my hardcover copy of ''Emma,'' by Jane Austen.
12/7/1998	For Microsoft, a New Industry Dispute	One evening last month at an impromptu gathering of reporters at the Comdex computer trade show, William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, enthusiastically described a breakthrough technology for improving the readability of text on the flat-panel color displays used on laptop computers. The new technique, which he said would be added to Microsoft's Windows operating system next year, is known as Cleartype, and it makes text on a portable computer almost as readable as a newspaper or a book, Mr. Gates asserted.
11/12/1998	PC's Just Cost Less	To the Editor: In his letter, Peter Haynes (''Dissent on Mac OS,'' Nov. 5) claims that PC's dominate the market because they work better than Mac's. It is widely acknowledged that PC's achieved market domination in the 1980's because they could be had for a fraction of the cost of comparatively powerful Macintosh computers.
11/12/1998	Beauty of a Flat Monitor	To the Editor: I recently wrestled with the question of whether or not to buy a flat computer monitor.
11/10/1998	A Microsoft Rebuttal but Nothing to Rebut	Expecting the Government to play a damaging videotape in Federal court today, executives of the Microsoft Corporation summoned reporters to an early morning news conference to offer an advance rebuttal in the form of their own videotape. The Government's videotape, Microsoft feared, would purport to demonstrate that Microsoft had -- in the words of an Apple Computer executive -- ''sabotaged'' Apple's Quicktime multimedia player.
11/6/1998	Judge in Microsoft Case Tries to Cut Through Jargon as He Questions Witness	Exhibiting increasing frustration with the slow pace of the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation, and with the sometimes incomprehensible techno-jargon, the presiding judge stepped forcefully into the courtroom proceedings today, repeatedly rebuking Microsoft's lawyer and then asking the witness, an Apple Computer Company executive, a long series of questions that went directly to the heart of the case. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court is both judge and jury in this case, and he has made clear over the course of the trial that he is not a technophile. He has also shown impatience with Microsoft's long and often tedious cross-examination of Government witnesses.
11/5/1998	Dissent on Mac OS	To the Editor: The article ''Mac OS Is Better Than Ever'' (Oct. 29) is generally on target. But Mac OS 8.5 is not easier to use and more elegant than Windows 98. I have been a systems consulting professional for 16 years. I have worked on mainframes, minis, Mac's and PC's. PC's dominate the market for a reason -- they work better.
11/5/1998	Microsoft Defends Tactics In 1997 Talks With Apple	The Microsoft Corporation argued in court today that it had every right to tell Apple Computer last year that it would stop producing word processors and other software for Macintosh computers unless Apple adopted Microsoft's Internet browser as the default choice on all its computers. ''Suppose Microsoft simply decides not to offer a product,'' said Theodore Edelman, a Microsoft lawyer. ''Do you have a problem with that?''
11/5/1998	Dissent on Mac OS	To the Editor: ''Mac OS Is Better Than Ever'' (Oct. 29) about OS 8.5 mentioned that Apple's success with the iMac was enticing software developers to produce more Macintosh software. We purchased an iMac as soon as it was available and are very pleased, up to a point.
11/3/1998	Gates on Tape: Scant Memory Of Key Details	The William H. Gates on the courtroom screen this afternoon was evasive and uninformed, pedantic and taciturn -- a world apart from his reputation as a brilliant business strategist, guiding every step in the Microsoft Corporation's rise to dominance in computing. In two hours of videotaped questioning selected by Justice Department lawyers from their 20-hour deposition of Mr. Gates last summer, Microsoft's chairman professed ignorance of key meetings and strategies that lie at the heart of charges in the Government's antitrust suit against his company. These included purported plans to bully competitors like Apple Computer Inc. and the Netscape Communications Corporation into abandoning Internet software markets that Microsoft sought to dominate.
10/31/1998	Apple Executive Testifies of Threats and Bullying by Microsoft	Shortly after Avadis Tevanian Jr. joined Apple Computer Inc. as a senior executive last year, he recalls, a software developer warned him that if Apple did not stop selling its highly successful Quicktime multimedia software product, ''Microsoft would take any necessary action to drive Apple out of businesss.'' Eighteen months later, ''I appreciate the prophetic import of his words,'' Dr. Tevanian stated in written testimony as a Government witness in the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corporation.
10/29/1998	Mac OS Is Better Than Ever	HOW unfortunate that 95 out of 100 personal computer buyers might not care that Mac OS 8.5, Apple Computer's new operating system software for Macintosh computers, is easier to use, more elegant, more innovative and more reliable than Windows 98. But for the nearly 5 percent -- Apple's current share of new computer sales -- who do care, and for the unknown percentage of computer owners who may be frustrated with the industry-standard Windows operating system, the good news is that Mac OS 8.5 is now available, as a $99 upgrade package for Macs of recent vintage or as the default system on new Apple computers. Mac OS 8.5 is certainly a better operating system than earlier versions of the Mac OS and, in some ways, for some users, better than Windows. It is not free of headaches, of course, and an operating system upgrade should never, ever be taken lightly. Several of my favorite older applications crashed when introduced to the new OS.
10/28/1998	In Its Case Against Microsoft, U.S. Now Cites Note From Apple	After four days spent watching lawyers for the Microsoft Corporation attack its key witness, the Justice Department today introduced a host of new documents, videotaped depositions and fresh testimony to strengthen its antitrust case and undermine Microsoft's defenses. Among the new evidence potentially most damaging to Microsoft was a handwritten note describing what the Government portrays as strong-arm tactics Microsoft successfully employed to force Apple Computer Inc. to ship Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, with Macintosh computers.
10/22/1998	NEWS WATCH	APPLE's NEW OPERATING SYSTEM -- Still basking in the warm glow of the iMAC's success, Apple Computer this week released MAC OS 8.5, the new operating system for Macintosh. Among the features the company is touting: Sherlock, a ''personal search detective'' that can browse the Internet by combining several search engines (including Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista) and can browse desktop files by content as well as by name, and the ability to copy files across a network twice as fast as the previous MAC OS and about 20 percent faster than Windows NT.
10/18/1998	Financier to the Garage Start-Up	AT 6 A.M. on Wednesdays, some of Silicon Valley's most prominent financiers gather at a basketball court of the Pacific Athletic Club in Redwood Shores, Calif., to rub -- and throw -- elbows. In that weekly pickup game, Guy Kawasaki, 5 feet 9 inches tall, has established himself as career leader in assists. Now he wants to become the leader at assisting off the court as well -- and get rich doing it. Mr. Kawasaki, 44, has taken a leave of absence from Apple Computer to concentrate on Garage.com, an Internet-based company that will match high-technology entrepreneurs with private investors and take stakes of its own in promising ventures. The name alludes to the fabled beginnings of many high-technology giants in their founders' garages.
10/15/1998	Apple's First Annual Profit Since 1995	Sounding a confident note of personal vindication, Steven P. Jobs, the interim chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., announced today that the company earned $106 million in its fourth quarter and was reporting its first profitable year since 1995. Easily outpacing analysts' forecast of 48 cents, Apple reported earnings of 68 cents a diluted share for the quarter, which ended on Sept. 25. That compared with a loss of $161 million, or $1.26 a share, in the corresponding period a year ago.
10/8/1998	Mac Program Generates Effortless Prose	THESE days, a freshly created word-processing file on a computer screen takes the place of the blank page as an object of terror for most writers, but The Fear remains. Now, if only there was a computer program that would actually do the writing for you. . . . Enter McPoet.
10/8/1998	Mac, Windows And Now, Linux	SINCE it was first developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki, the operating system called Linux has engendered strong -- some might say fanatical -- loyalty among a growing community of users. To be a Linux devotee today is a bit like being one of the early users of the Internet, when using it required a solid technical grounding. As it inches its way into the computing mainstream, Linux is beginning to enjoy more widespread acceptance. Last month, Intel and Netscape, along with venture capital firms, invested in Red Hat Software, a company that sells a packaged version of Linux together with applications. And rumors abound that Intel is planning investments in other Linux companies as well. Other well-established computer companies -- Oracle, Informix, Computer Associates, Corel Computer and I.B.M. -- have announced plans to make products available for Linux.
9/9/1998	Microsoft Asks For Dismissal Of U.S. Suit	In a long, derisive court brief, the Microsoft Corporation asked a Federal judge today to dismiss the Government's antitrust suit, arguing that the Justice Department and 20 states were trying to ''distract the court from the fatal defects in their claims by slinging as much mud as they can.'' Microsoft was answering a Justice Department brief filed last week that detailed new evidence accusing Microsoft of trying to tyrannize several competing companies, including the Intel Corporation, Apple Computer Inc. and the Intuit Corporation, maker of the Quicken accounting software. The Microsoft trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 23.
9/4/1998	Mircosoft Ordered to Provide More Antitrust Evidence	A Federal judge ordered the Microsoft Corporation today to give the Justice Department reams of new evidence that Government lawyers say will bolster their antitrust case against the software giant. Microsoft's lawyers had argued that the new evidence, intended to demonstrate that the company pressured and bullied the Intel Corporation, Apple Computer and the Real Networks Corporation, should not be a part of the case since it was not specifically mentioned in the original lawsuits filed by the Justice Department and 20 states on May 18.
9/1/1998	Apple TV Spot Wins Emmy Award	A commercial for Apple Computer Inc. in Cupertino, Calif., won the Emmy Award for outstanding television commercials at the annual competition sponsored by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The winning spot, created by TBWA Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., part of Omnicom Group, introduced the Apple ''Think different'' campaign saluting ''the crazy ones'' like Einstein, Gandhi and Picasso. The winning spot was one of five nominated in the commercial category competition; it was honored at a ceremony on Saturday at which creative awards were bestowed in advance of the televised Emmys presentation on Sept. 13.
8/20/1998	iMacs Are Selling Fast But the G3 Is Truly Hot	Sales of Apple's new iMac are hot. So is one problem with Apple's new Powerbook G3 series laptop computers, according to customers and technicians. ''It is definitely an issue,'' said Jason D. O'Grady, publisher of O'Grady's Power Page (www.ogrady.com), a Web site for Powerbook information. He said his own 292-megahertz Powerbook G3 occasionally became so hot he could not touch the bottom. Mr. O'Grady noted, however, that powerful Windows-based laptops could become just as warm.
8/13/1998	Stalking the Mac Thrill of Yesteryear	FOR nearly two years, my friend Nancy Bendit has blamed me for persuading her to buy a Macintosh Performa. Her complaints fall into three categories: 1. There is not enough cool software to run on the Mac.
8/13/1998	2 New Apple Entries Are Heavy on Design and Light on Price	Anyone can see through Apple Computer's latest efforts to win back customers. That's because two of Apple's most innovative products -- both featuring translucent plastic cases -- go on sale this week at prices lower than Apple has charged in a long time. There's the $1,299 iMac computer, of course, which Apple said had attracted more than 150,000 orders in advance of its release on Saturday. Analysts expect Apple to sell out its first production run of 400,000 iMacs before the end of the year.
8/11/1998	Sales Booming for New Apple Computer	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had received more than 150,000 orders for its new iMac Macintosh computer since the company began taking orders a week ago. The iMac, which is aimed at the consumer and education markets, goes on sale Saturday at a suggested retail price of $1,299. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has high hopes for the iMac, which features a translucent green case, an integrated monitor and an illuminated mouse, and some analysts have estimated that the company could sell more than one million of the new machine in its first year.
8/10/1998	Apple Chooses Earthlink for iMac Service	Apple Computer Inc. has chosen Earthlink Network Inc. as the default Internet service provider for its new iMac home computers. Users who choose Apple's one-step Internet setup will be hooked up with the Earthlink Network, which will waive its usual $25 setup fee and give 30 days of free service to iMac buyers.
8/6/1998	Gandhi as Salesman	To the Editor: Your Aug. 3 Business Day article on Apple Computer's ''Think Different'' advertisements merely alluded to the questionable ethics of this advertising campaign. What would Mohandas K. Gandhi -- whose philosophy was based largely on his rejection of material goods -- say about his humble portrait being used to hawk computers five decades after his death?
8/3/1998	Apple Endorses Some Achievers Who 'Think Different'	A computer marketer wants to become the apple of your eye by advertising itself as the Apple of your icon. For almost a year, Apple Computer Inc. has been displaying images of some of the world's most-admired achievers in fields from government and business to human rights and the arts as the centerpiece of a campaign that ungrammatically urges consumers to ''Think different.''
7/30/1998	Dartmouth Gives iMac A Stamp of Approval	The Apple iMac, to be released Aug. 15, got a vote of approval from Dartmouth College, which placed the computer on its recommended list for incoming students.
7/30/1998	For Macintosh Users, the Little How-To Book That Grew	THE LITTLE MAC BOOK, FIFTH EDITION By Robin Williams (Peachpit Press, $19.95).
7/30/1998	Praise for iMac	To the Editor: The iMac article (''Who Said Computers Have to Be Square?'' July 23) claimed that there was little software available for the Mac. There are more than 12,000 software titles available for the MAC OS. The fact that there are thousands more available for the Windows/DOS platform is acknowledged, but many of those are of questionable use -- just how many games do computer users need? How many different word processors do they need? Most, if not all, major applications are available in Mac OS and Windows versions.
7/30/1998	Praise for iMac	To the Editor: The comparison of Apple's soon-to-be released iMac and the I.B.M. Aptiva (''Who Said Computers Have to Be Square?'' July 23) suggests how far from rational our computer purchasing decisions have roamed. Both machines are priced as ''entry level'' machines, which means that they cost the equivalent of only one month's mortgage payment on a $175,000 house. Each has a functional shelf life of approximately one year (while these machines will undoubtedly function for more than a year, they will certainly fall into disfavor if not disuse within the year), so the cost works out to about $100 to $150 per month. Add an Internet service provider and the occasional game, and the cost of ownership approaches the lease price of a 1998 Ford Taurus. Which seats six.
7/30/1998	Praise for iMac	To the Editor: Your article on Apple's new iMac (''Who Said Computers Have to Be Square?'' July 23) seemed to suffer from the idea that bigger always means better -- e.g., for hard-drive space (when's the last time you used four megabytes of it?) and monitor size (if anything, monitors are clunky and cumbersome monstrosities that eat desk space). The iMac allows consumers one device in a simplified package. As for the lack of a disk drive, this is a godsend because no one can use floppies in any useful multimedia way anymore and they will go the way of the dinosaurs. If anything, this is forward thinking.
7/28/1998	TV Ads Nominated For Emmy Awards	Five commercials have been nominated for 1997 Emmy Awards by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The winner will be announced in September. One nominee is ''Freshman,'' a commercial for the AT&T Corporation in which a mother leaves her freshman daughter at college as Frank Sinatra sings ''Our Love Is Here to Stay'' on the soundtrack. The spot was created by Young & Rubicam Advertising in New York and the production company Gartner in Los Angeles.
7/26/1998	Is This the Factory of the Future?	THE conveyor belt deposits a tray holding a half-built computer and a stack of parts in front of Sheila Roby. Wielding an electric screwdriver, Ms. Roby installs the arrayed circuit boards, memory chips and disk drives. Within five minutes, she is ready to snap on the beige cover, emblazoned with a gleaming red Compaq logo. As that machine glides away, it is replaced by another chassis and another package of parts for Ms. Roby to assemble. But this time, the logo on the cover is blue, and it says I.B.M.
7/23/1998	Who Said Computers Have to Be Square?	APPLE was certainly ''thinking different'' when it created the iMac. The new personal computer, which goes on sale on Aug. 15, has already won popular acclaim for its creative design and its refreshing departure from the computer industry standard of boring beige boxes. By rushing the iMac to market, Apple succeeded in getting on the radar screens of buyers before the next school year starts. There is a pent-up demand among owners of older Macintoshes for an affordable upgrade, and Apple is expected to sell all the iMacs it can make in coming months.
7/20/1998	Compressed Data; Microsoft's Apple Stake Is Hardly Altruism	When the Microsoft Corporation invested $150 million in Apple Computer last August, the action was viewed as a kind of self-interested donation. In the bargain, Apple agreed to drop a lingering patent suit against Microsoft and also agreed to use Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the standard browser on its Macintosh machines. With Apple then in dire financial straits, Steven P. Jobs, the company's co-founder and acting chief, said the appropriate response from the Apple faithful was to ''treat Microsoft with a little gratitude.''
7/16/1998	Apple Earnings Again Exceed Expectations	Confounding the skeptics yet again, a resurgent Apple Computer Inc. exceeded earnings estimates made by Wall Street analysts for the third consecutive quarter today. Apple said it had sold a record number of its G3 Macintosh computers and that profit margins improved in the quarter. Apple reported its results after the market's close, but in anticipation of a strong quarter, Apple shares closed at $34.4375, up $1, at a new 52-week high in Nasdaq trading. Analysts said the company's revenues were as expected, but that higher margins raised earnings because Apple sold a greater percentage of high-end machines. Revenues might have been higher had the company been able to meet demand for its new Powerbook laptop models.
7/14/1998	At Macworld Show, Apple Turns Out New Products and Plenty of Promises	THE relatively sparse crowds and smaller exhibit booths at last week's Macworld trade show in New York were tangible evidence of the decline of Apple Computer in recent years. Visitors to the show typically found that promises almost outnumbered actual products. But while dazzling new products were scarce at Macworld, no doubt many people were just as happy to take home some optimism about the future of Macintosh. The centerpiece of the show was a aqua and white beach ball of a computer called the iMac. The iMac, which is the computer equivalent of a new Volkswagen Beetle, was announced more than two months ago and will not reach stores for another month.
7/13/1998	Compressed Data; The Mac Is Out; The Mac Is Back	Just as Steven P. Jobs was taking the stage in New York to flaunt Apple Computer's financial upturn and sing the praises of the company's new consumer strategy, Wells Fargo Bank was busy informing its on-line banking customers that it would no longer support the Macintosh version of Quicken, the leading financial software program from Intuit Inc. In their announcement, bank representatives said that users of Mac Quicken amounted to only about 1 percent of their on-line users, or 7,000 customers. As of Aug. 7, they would no longer be able to log on, the announcement said.
7/9/1998	A.D.S.L. Lines of BellSouth To Start Including Mac Users	BellSouth plans to tap into the Apple market as the phone company speeds up its rollout of the A.D.S.L. high-speed Internet connection. When the company, which provides local phone service in the southeastern United States, first announced its rollout of A.D.S.L. (asymmetric digital subscriber line) technology in May, it focused on Windows computers. But the company then received what it called a huge demand for the service from Macintosh devotees, something that caught its attention.
7/7/1998	Powerbooks Give Macintosh Cause for Optimism	THE largest gathering of Apple Macintosh fans on the East Coast begins tomorrow in Manhattan, and they have several reasons to be optimistic after more than a year of darkness and turmoil. Led by co-founder Steven P. Jobs, Apple appears to have stabilized its management team, cut costs, made some money, halted a precipitous decline in market share, outlined (at last) a clear path for its Mac operating system, and streamlined and reinvigorated its product lineup. The company is not out of the woods yet, of course. Apple's decision last year to kill the Macintosh clone market may have boosted Apple's financial prospects, but it was of no benefit to consumers and it contributed to the overall decline in market share for the Macintosh operating system. (Even the Palm Pilot operating system and Windows 3.1 outsold the Mac OS last year.)
7/2/1998	Living With Windows 98	To the Editor: ''Windows 98: $90 Worth Of Duct Tape'' tells the truth about the new release: there is nothing compelling about it. Except that it includes Apple's Quick Time 3.0 technology.
7/2/1998	Flaw in Word 98 Can Spread Your Personal Information	It's a paranoid computer user's worst nightmare: private information from your hard disk made accessible for the reading enjoyment of strangers. And it could happen if you use Microsoft Word 98 for Macintosh. As reported last week on the Mac in Touch Web page (www.macintouch.com), hidden chunks of old E-mail, disk-directory paths, Web addresses and other confidential information from a user's hard drive or RAM can be embedded in Microsoft Word 98 documents. The unintended information can be made visible when the documents are opened with a text-editing program like BBEdit, thus making E-mail or network files a potential security risk.
6/11/1998	A Long Way From Simplicity	To the Editor: Do computers have to be difficult to use? No: buy a Mac. SEAN GRAINGER London, June 2, 1988
6/4/1998	Computers: Hard to Use?	To the Editor: I have just finished reading your article on computer simplicity (''Do Computers Have to Be Hard to Use?'' May 28). It does address a lot of the concerns that consumers have about using computers. However, it focuses mainly on Windows computers and either ignores or presents in a negative way the computers that pioneered the idea of computer simplicity, namely Macintoshes.
5/14/1998	Adding Polish to Home Video	DR. STEPHANIE EISENSTAT of Concord, Mass., had only a basic working knowledge of personal computers when her neighbor encouraged her to learn a video editing program for the Macintosh. Dr. Eisenstat, 43, runs a domestic violence program at Massachusetts General Hospital and was trying to find more efficient ways to teach her fellow doctors, all short of time, to be more sensitive to the needs of victims. So, armed with little but her Windows-based knowledge, she taped a patient's testimony at the hospital, then took it to her neighbor's house and edited it on Avid Cinema, a video editing program that has been included with some Power Macintosh models, adding music, titles and fades.
5/14/1998	New Mac Gets an A For Offbeat Cuteness	Some people who have seen the iMac, the new Apple computer that is scheduled to be in stores in August, say it reminds them of a Volkswagen Beetle, a cartoon turtle or even a giant electronic gum drop. Its mouse glows in the dark. It is a brightly colored, roly-poly computer that like the earlier Apple IIs is a one-piece design -- the monitor and central processing unit are in one box.
5/12/1998	Rhapsody's Out, OS X In, in Shift Of Gear at Apple	Continuing to gamble big in his efforts to resurrect Apple Computer Inc., Steven P. Jobs, the company's interim chief executive, today effectively killed the Rhapsody operating system, which Apple acquired when it bought Mr. Jobs's company Next Software Inc. for $425 million in 1997. In its place, Mr. Jobs unveiled Mac OS X, a system that he said would be commercially available in the third quarter of 1999 and contain all the modern software features that the company has been promising its customers since the early 1990's.
5/7/1998	Chapel Hill Campus in Uproar Over Issue of Computer Choice	A small but determined group of students and staff members at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is organizing resistance to a university plan to require each student to own a personal computer by 2000. What has especially riled the students is that the plan calls for designating the types of computer that students will be told to get. Laptop instead of desktop, for instance.
5/6/1998	INTUIT TO PRODUCE QUICKEN FOR MACINTOSH AFTER ALL	Intuit Inc. said yesterday that it would produce its popular Quicken personal-finance software for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh next year, reversing an earlier decision. Intuit, which makes personal-finance and tax-preparation software, said it would produce a packaged software version of Quicken for Macintosh in the second half of 1999. Intuit said last month that it would stop developing new versions of its flagship program for Macintosh, citing declining sales. Apple has had trouble persuading software developers to write new programs for Macintosh as its market share continues to slide. Yesterday, an Intuit spokesman, Adam Samuels said, ''We're excited about Apple's prospects and its upcoming consumer products,'' adding that the two companies had been in talks for the last two weeks. Intuit, based in Mountain View, Calif., also produces a version of its tax-preparation software, called Macintax, for Macintosh computers.
4/24/1998	Prisoner Of Paradox	The Dalai Lama finds himself these days tending to so many fires at once that, whichever direction he turns, he is likely to get burned. A Nobel Peace Prize laureate treated in some quarters as a terrorist, a ubiquitous icon courted by certain heads of state only in private, he has had to lead his people from a distant exile for almost 40 years and to abandon full-time spiritual practice for the back rooms of geopolitics since the age of 15. So when a full-page portrait of him was recently featured in an Apple Computer advertising campaign (under the words, ''Think different''), some friends of Tibet shuddered a little to see his image once again prized before his cause. With his popularity and prestige, the Dalai Lama was sure to help Apple, but would Apple be helping the Dalai Lama?
4/23/1998	Intuit Is Backing Away From Quicken for Macs	In yet another bruise for Apple, the maker of the popular Quicken 98 personal finance program quietly announced last week that it would not release a new version of Quicken for Apple Macintosh computers this fall. The company, Intuit, cited declining Mac sales and said it would transfer its Macintosh engineers to work on Intuit's Web site (www.quicken.com). Intuit will continue to provide support for Mac Quicken 98 users, the company said, and will continue to develop new versions of Macintax, the company's Federal and state income tax program.
4/22/1998	Next to Gates, Rockefeller Shines	To the Editor: ''Apple Removes Dalai Lama From Its Ads in Hong Kong'' (Business Day, April 17) quotes an Apple Computer spokeswoman as saying: ''The Dalai Lama really stands for our message in the United States. But in China, he may not get across the message that Apple is trying to convey.'' Over here, where its safe to show an image of the Dalai Lama, Apple is happy to do it. But in China, where displaying his image would truly reflect Apple's slogan, ''Think Different,'' the company backs down. Like many other companies vying for their share of the Chinese market, Apple takes great pains not to offend the Chinese Government.
4/21/1998	Intuit to Halt Quicken Updates for Macs	Intuit Inc. said yesterday that it would stop developing new versions of its flagship personal finance software, Quicken, for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computers, citing declining sales. Intuit sent letters to the 365,000 registered customers of the Macintosh version of the program to notify them that it would not produce a new Macintosh version of the software this fall.
4/17/1998	Apple Removes the Dalai Lama From Its Ads in Hong Kong	Apple Computer, the self-styled rebel of the American computer industry, has removed images of the Dalai Lama from an advertising campaign in Asia for fear of offending China. Apple has used Tibet's exiled spiritual leader in the United States, where he appears as one of a series of revolutionary figures from politics, academia, culture and business. But he will be conspicuously absent from Apple's ads here, which will feature Muhammad Ali, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Alfred Hitchcock, Pablo Picasso and Amelia Earhart.
4/16/1998	Apple Profits Are Double Expectations	Confounding the skeptics again, Apple Computer Inc. reported quarterly earnings today that were more than twice the consensus forecast of Wall Street analysts. The surprisingly strong results -- the first time the company has posted back-to-back quarterly profits since 1995 -- came, however, largely as a result of improved profit margins and sharp cost-cutting. Revenue fell 12 percent in the company's fiscal second quarter from the comparable quarter a year earlier and 11 percent from the fiscal first quarter.
4/16/1998	A Response From Apple	To the Editor: We don't think our 28 million installed-base users would agree with your assessment of Apple (''Clan Macintosh Feels the Pain,'' April 2).
4/11/1998	Apple Denies Patent-Infringement Claim	Apple Computer Inc. today denied claims made in a $1.1 billion patent infringement suit filed in February by Imatec Ltd. and said that it would ''vigorously defend'' itself. Imatec sued Apple in February, contending that Apple's Color Sync systems infringed patents held by Imatec and issued to Hanoch Shalit, who is chairman and chief executive of that company. The suit sought $1.1 billion in damages and was filed in Federal court in New York.
4/9/1998	A Switch? Many Mac Fans Say 'No'	The New York Times received more than 150 letters from readers -- nearly all from outraged Mac fans -- in response to ''Clan Macintosh Feels the Pain'' (April 2). Here are a few of them:

4/2/1998	Clan Macintosh Feels the Pain	Most people merely buy a computer. Apple Macintosh customers fall in love. Some Mac owners love their computers so much that they tattoo the rainbow-stripe Apple logo into their skin, proclaiming a passion unsurpassed in consumerism except by certain riders of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Even though Windows-based computers now outsell Macs by more than 20 to 1, when was the last time you saw people with ''Windows 95'' flags or ''Intel Inside'' logos pierced into their flesh with needles?
4/2/1998	Breaking the PC Barrier	STEPHEN MOORE, a director of computer services at Georgetown University, likes to log in with his Macintosh from home and run programs built for Windows machines. He runs a program named Virtual PC that makes it simple for Macintosh users to fit in with the dominant culture. Mr. Moore, like all Macintosh devotees, faces continual pressure at work to switch to a PC, but he refuses. An avid guitarist and fan of Frank Zappa and Miles Davis, he says that the best software for musicians is on the Mac and that he has little trouble fitting into a PC world.
3/26/1998	In the Race for the Fastest Chip, Just Don't Blink	THE past week went fast, and faster. Steve Jobs, the acting chief executive of Apple Computer, showed off what is now the fastest personal computer on the planet, a 300-megahertz version of the G3 PowerPC Macintosh. Then, to top it off, Mr. Jobs demonstrated a 400-MHz prototype that used a new copper (instead of aluminum) wiring scheme on the chip. Apple has not wasted any time capitalizing on its speed advantage over Intel Pentium-based machines, with new advertisements that show a Pentium II chip strapped to the back of a snail and one of Intel's bunny-suited chip technicians being toasted to ashes by the speed of Apple's rival PowerPC chips. Intel did not waste any time retaliating. No sooner had Mr. Jobs finished his demonstrations than he was upstaged at the German CeBIT trade show by Intel's Albert Yu, a senior vice president, who showed off a prototype Pentium II chip operating at 700 MHz. Don't look for it in stores until the millennium, Mr. Yu said. On the more immediate horizon, Intel plans to release both a 400-MHz and a 450-MHz version of the Pentium II later this year.
3/18/1998	Apple Executives To Receive Stock	Apple Computer Inc. has set aside 17 million shares, or 13 percent of its total shares outstanding, to be awarded to executives in an effort to prevent the loss of top talent. The shares will be given to senior executives, including the chairman, chief operating officer and other ''key employees.'' The new plan, outlined in Apple's proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, expands the number of shares that may be awarded and the types of stock-based performance awards that may be granted.
3/12/1998	Standing Up for Mac	To the Editor: I am an avowed Macintosh user. That said, let me take issue with the assertion that Macs are too expensive (''Who Bucks Tide and Chooses Mac?'' March 5). I recently helped an acquaintance of mine buy a computer on a budget of $2,000 for everything, including a modem and printer. I compared Macintosh with a Windows box with comparable features and functions. There was no price difference. Let me say it again. There was no price difference. The cry that Macintoshes are more expensive is just not true. It was true many years ago, but it isn't true today, nor will it be tomorrow.
3/12/1998	Apple Computer Hiring Compaq Executive	Apple Computer said today that it had named Timothy D. Cook, the No. 2 manufacturing executive at the Compaq Computer Corporation, as its senior vice president for worldwide manufacturing operations. Mr. Cook was vice president for corporate materials at Compaq and previously worked at I.B.M. for more than a decade, most recently in charge of manufacturing and distribution for I.B.M.'s Personal Computer Company in North and Latin America.

2/28/1998	APPLE COMPUTER TO DISCONTINUE NEWTON LINE	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would stop making Newton software and products so it could focus on its Macintosh operating system. The Newton operating system is used in Apple's Messagepad 2100 and eMate 300 computers. The company plans to sell the remaining Newton-based hand-helds and will begin making Mac OS-based models next year. Apple's decision comes amid increasing competition in the palmtop-computing market from machines that use Microsoft's Windows CE software and computers like 3Com's Palm Pilot that use their own systems. Apple's shares rose 12.5 cents yesterday, to $23.625.
2/5/1998	AT HOME WITH: Jonathan Ive; Making Computers Cute Enough to Wear	THE afternoon sun is spilling through the living room windows of this house perched on a hill overlooking the city where the computer designer Jonathan Ive is talking about creating computers based on what he calls ''emotional human forms.'' There is a fireplace in the sparsely appointed interior and a tiny television sitting atop an upscale stereo with a turntable, and virtually all the furniture is on wheels. The room is lighted by a futuristic lamp, which appears to hang like a red orb, but there isn't a personal computer in sight.
1/30/1998	Fast-Growing PC Maker Out Of Business	The Power Computing Corporation, until last summer the fastest-growing personal computer company of the 1990's, has apparently gone out of business. The company, which started selling Apple Macintosh clones in 1995 and had revenue of $400 million in 1996, held an auction here today to sell the last of its physical assets, right down to the cafeteria tables and paper clips.
1/29/1998	Best Buy to End Apple PC Sales	The Best Buy Company, operator of electronics and office stores in 32 states, said yesterday that it would no longer carry Apple Computer Inc. computers. But the company will continue stocking Apple software products, a Best Buy spokeswoman. Best Buy said the change was a mutual decision by the two companies, stemming from ''an ever-changing and fiercely competitive PC market and a time of redirection for Apple Computer.''
1/28/1998	Layoffs Set at Apple Unit	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would lay off 300 workers from its Claris software subsidiary in the latest in a series of job cuts by the computer maker. Apple said it would reorganize Claris to focus exclusively on its Filemaker Pro data base software. The unit will change its name to Filemaker Inc. and shed all products other than the Filemaker Pro line. Apple will take over development and distribution of the unit's Clarisworks productivity software on Feb. 1.
1/26/1998	Iomega is spending heavily to loft its brand into the name-recognition stratosphere.	EVEN as computer technology becomes more imbedded in mainstream culture, it remains uncommon for a branded product to command the loyalty of the garden variety customer. Those achieving that status are, of course, some of the world's most powerful brands: Apple's Macintosh; Microsoft's Windows; Intel's Pentium chips. The Iomega Corporation, a leader in the formerly arcane computer technology niche called portable data storage, aspires to that level of branding power. Iomega markets the Zip drive, a data-storage system with disks holding 100 megabytes of data, the equivalent of 70 standard floppy disks.
1/15/1998	Sales of G3 Computer Lift Apple Back to Profitability	Apple Computer Inc. today delivered on the return to profitability promised last week by Steven P. Jobs, the company's co-founder and interim chief executive. Apple attributed its surprisingly strong quarterly results to better-than-expected sales of its G3 Power Macintosh computers and to cost reductions. But Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, cautioned analysts not to expect revenue growth in the current quarter, noting that it is generally the slowest for the company. He said he did not expect year-over-year growth in revenue until this summer.

1/7/1998	Apple to Post Quarter Profit Of $45 Million	Apple Computer's acting chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, stunned Wall Street analysts this morning by reporting that Apple would register a $45 million quarterly profit on revenue of $1.575 billion. The announcement, which was delivered a week before the computer maker is scheduled to report its 1998 fiscal first-quarter results, was delivered with Mr. Jobs's characteristic flair: as a seeming afterthought that punctuated a 90-minute speech before a crowd of more than 4,000 Macintosh enthusiasts.
1/5/1998	1997 HIGHLIGHTS	Homespun Suitor Wins Fight for MCI It seemed like the perfect marriage for a decade of globalization: MCI and British Telecommunications, which already had an international alliance, would form a trans-Atlantic colossus. But after it appeared that MCI's dowry might not be as large as anticipated -- MCI disclosed unexpectedly high costs in its effort to move into the local telephone business -- the British company and its shareholders turned cool. That opened the door to two United States rivals: GTE and a young suitor, Worldcom, with a more humble background but ambitious plans. In the end, Worldcom swept MCI and Wall Street off their feet with a $36.5 billion winning bid.
1/3/1998	Shares of Apple Computer Rise Sharply	The shares of Apple Computer Inc. rose 24 percent today amid optimism that the company, the maker of Macintosh computers, will have surprise news at next week's MacWorld Expo in San Francisco. The company's shares rose $3.125, to $16.25, on trading of 6.4 million shares.
11/30/1997	Always Faithful	''We fight back for Mac in an honorable way,'' says Jesse (the Sarge) Brown, a former Marine sergeant who heads a band of Macintosh users called the Mac Marines. His goal sounds more wonk than warrior: to protect Apple Computer's market share against ''Wintel boxes,'' the Intel-chip-equipped computers that run the industry gorilla, Microsoft Windows. Roughly 1,800 strong, the Marines are die-hards (the Sarge is a Mac support staff member at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md.) who speak up for their favorite company during its desperate times. Their major weapon -- their only weapon, in fact -- is E-mail. The Macmarine Web page includes, under the heading ''ammo,'' technical info and stats for use in barrages directed at companies and institutions that are planning to dump their Macs or at unfriendly journalists.
11/11/1997	Apple to Offer Custom Orders Over the Internet	Falling significantly short of announcing any of the jolting deals that had been rumored for weeks, Steven P. Jobs spoke today at a college auditorium packed with more than 2,000 Apple Computer employees, journalists and analysts, and said the struggling computer maker would begin selling by way of the Internet and building computers to order in its factories. Indeed, it is a measure of Mr. Jobs's charisma and leadership prowess that despite the lack of a rumored network computer deal with the Oracle Corporation that had been predicted by a number of publications, analysts today gave the company's co-founder and acting chief executive positive marks in his bid to restore Apple to stability.
11/4/1997	APPLE IS CUTTING THE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTORS	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it was cutting the number of its domestic distributors from five to two as of Dec. 1 to more effectively manage the company's shrinking sales. Ingram Micro Inc. and Microage Inc. will be the remaining distributors of Macintosh computers in the United States. The Techdata Corporation, the Inacom Corporation and Merisel Inc. will sell Macs overseas. The move reflects insufficient sales by Apple to spread among five resellers. The company said in September that it was cutting to $2 million from $20 million the amount dealers must spend on Apple annually to buy computers directly from the company. Apple shares rose 34.375 cents, to $17.375.
10/20/1997	As Yale Moves Away From Apple Computer, Cries (Nay, Shouts) of Conflict of Interest	Last June, students preparing for their freshman year at Yale received a letter from the university's director of information technology, Daniel A. Updegrove, steering them toward the purchase of personal computers using the Windows operating system from Microsoft, equipped with microprocessors from Intel. It was unlikely, the letter said, that appropriate software would continue to be available for computers made by Apple Computer -- until recently the most popular machines on campus. ''The University cannot guarantee support for Macintoshes beyond June 2000,'' the letter said.
10/16/1997	Apple Reports Quarterly Loss That Is Larger Than Expected	Apple Computer reported a loss for the fourth fiscal quarter today that was wider than expected, as its revenue was badly hurt by a sharp decline in Japanese business. The report showed the hard-pressed computer maker continuing to struggle as it looks for a way to regain its share of the market. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., did not post a quarterly profit all year, ending with a loss of $1.045 billion, compared with a loss of $816 million in its previous fiscal year.
9/29/1997	New Apple Ad Lifts Off From Disney's Land	Apple Computer Inc. has not officially adopted the Walt Disney ditty ''It's a Small World'' as a corporate song. But it might as well after the cozy events surrounding the introduction last night of a highly anticipated advertising campaign. The Apple campaign, carrying the theme ''Think different,'' began with a slick, star-stuffed television commercial during the broadcast of the animated film ''Toy Story'' on ''The Wonderful World of Disney,'' a new weekly ABC series. The 60-second commercial, which ran twice during the movie, is the start of an ambitious, multimillion-dollar effort to polish Apple's image, which has been bruised by serious setbacks in the personal computer market.
9/27/1997	Apple Shifts Ways It Sells Computers	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it planned to simplify how it sells computers to dealers to put its products in more stores. The moves include adding 100 people to work closely with dealers and cutting the amount of unsold inventory that can be returned to Apple. The actions will probably help lower Apple's costs, analysts said, and make the company, which has suffered from sliding sales and sharp losses, a bit more efficient.
9/15/1997	Apple Picks TBWA To Handle Europe	The European unit of Apple Computer Inc. has selected TBWA International in Amsterdam to handle its creative account, with billings estimated at $20 million, after a review in which the agency had been left off the official list of participants. The decision echoed the course of a review that began in June for the domestic portion of Apple's account, with billings estimated at $80 million. That review began without the North American unit of TBWA International, TBWA Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., but ended with TBWA Chiat/Day's selection on Aug. 10.
9/12/1997	Motorola Sees Low Earnings; Stock Tumbles	Motorola Inc. said yesterday that its earnings in the third quarter would be significantly below expectations, hurt by weak sales of pagers and one-time costs. It also said it would stop producing clones of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, resulting in one of those costs, a $95 million charge. The announcement, after the close of the market, sent Motorola stock sharply lower in after-hours trading. The shares, which had been nearly flat in the regular session, plunged $8.375, to $66, after the close.
9/9/1997	Motorola and I.B.M. Look Beyond Chip Pact With Apple	In the latest fallout from the troubles at Apple Computer, the company's chip partners, Motorola and I.B.M., said today that they were refocusing the Power PC microprocessor family into new markets beyond the computer industry, toward applications in consumer electronics and industrial markets. The Power PC chip, which drives the Apple Macintosh personal computer and its clones, evolved from a grand alliance struck by Apple Computer, Motorola and I.B.M. in 1992 in an effort to thwart the growing power of chips made by the Intel Corporation and software by Microsoft.
9/6/1997	In a Reversal, Apple Decides It Will Keep Its Newton Unit	In a reversal, Apple Computer Inc. has decided not to spin off its Newton division and will instead develop a general purpose version of the company's Emate portable, which is now sold only to schools. The move is one of several sweeping changes that Steven P. Jobs has made at Apple since taking over as the company's unofficial chief executive last month. Earlier this week, Mr. Jobs announced that Apple would not expand its licenses with clone makers and that it was buying out the license of its largest competitor, the Power Computing Corporation.
9/3/1997	Apple Decides Cloning Isn't Its Route Back To Profitability	Apple Computer Inc. has effectively ended its strategy of attempting to grow through the cloning of its Macintosh computers, agreeing to buy the Macintosh business of its largest licensee. The embattled personal computer maker said today that it would spend $100 million to purchase the Macintosh business of the Power Computing Corporation, the largest and most aggressive of the handful of companies that have been selling computers that run the Macintosh operating system. Apple will acquire technology and take on some employees as well as the direct marketing and build-to-order capabilities of Power Computing, which is based in Austin, Tex.
9/2/1997	Weighing Time for New Little Mac	MEMBERS of the so-called Macintosh community get extremely touchy when anyone so much as hints that the Macintosh might not be the coolest, most elegant electronic device in the known universe. The Macintosh engenders a sort of fanaticism unknown among the competition; no one ever refers to a ''Windows community.'' But then, Windows users, who constitute the vast majority, tend not to think of themselves as members of some elite group. Macintosh computers still offer several advantages over their Windows counterparts. They are easier to link together, simpler to attach peripherals to, less likely to cause software errors because of sound or display problems and recover more easily from some kinds of trouble. But as Mac and Windows both keep getting more and more complex, it becomes increasingly clear that the Macintosh can be every bit as difficult to use and learn. In many ways the Mac is not better, just different.
9/1/1997	An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil	The steady stream of cyclists who roll by the big steel gate here each weekend may scarcely have time to glance through the bars at the baronial estate inside as they pedal to the hills overlooking Silicon Valley. But behind that gate is an explanation -- or an interpretation, at least -- of the early glory and recent perils of the valley's most storied company.
8/12/1997	Apple Foresees Weak Fourth Quarter	Apple Computer Inc. does not expect to be profitable in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September, the company said in a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it expected that net sales -- sales minus returns -- would be below the levels of a year through at least March 1998.
8/11/1997	Apple Sending Clone Makers Mixed Signals	With all the momentous announcements at last week's MacWorld Expo trade show, Apple Computer executives were nearly silent on an issue of strategic importance to the future of the troubled company: Whether Apple would continue to license the Macintosh operating system to makers of lower-priced Mac clones. The absence of any straight answers is fueling speculation that Apple executives -- starting, apparently, with Steven P. Jobs, the company's co-founder -- seem to think the clones do Apple more harm than good. Clone sales now account for one of every five Macintosh computers sold.
8/11/1997	TBWA Chiat/Day Gets Apple Account	Apple Computer Inc., as expected, has named TBWA Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., to handle its domestic account, with billings estimated at $60 million to $80 million. The account had been handled by the BBDO West unit of BBDO Worldwide in Los Angeles until that agency resigned in June rather than participate in a review. A TBWA Chiat/Day predecessor agency, Chiat/Day, handled the domestic duties from 1983 until 1986, when Apple dismissed Chiat/Day in favor of BBDO West. Both TBWA Chiat/Day and BBDO are owned by Omnicom Group.
8/10/1997	Bailout of Apple Won't Increase Competition	To the Editor: The Microsoft Corporation's $150 million investment in Apple Computer Inc. (front page, Aug. 7) is hardly altruistic. Microsoft is simply insuring that homeless Apple customers do not migrate to a Java operating system or to the network computer -- an inexpensive machine that would provide access to all the information held on corporate networks and the global Internet. Java, with its flexibility, and the network computer, with its simplicity, threaten to overwhelm a computing industry in which profits are linked to how often users can be made to upgrade and how strongly dependent they are on a particular vendor.
8/10/1997	An Industry and Its Founders Grow Up	THE personal computer industry was created in the mid-1970's by a few hundred fiercely competitive, idealistic young men barely out of their teens. Their mission was to change the world by democratizing digital technology (and, yes, to get rich too). They pursued their goals with the energy and passion of youth. Disagreements had a way of escalating into shouting matches, and conflicts became holy wars. Today, the computer industry has grown to become a $150-billion-a-year business and the people who built it have grown up as well. Most of them are now in their 40's, married with children. They have less hair and more pounds. Many are worth millions or, in a few cases, billions of dollars.
8/9/1997	Microsoft Monopoly? Not So Fast	Op-Ed article by Michael L Dertouzos, director of MIT's computer science lab, says Microsoft's $150-million investment in Apple giveds company chance to regain its lost footing in personal computer marketplace; hopes Apple can summon will to embark on aggressive, visionary mission to enhance helpfulness of computers in human life (S)
8/8/1997	The Apple of Microsoft's Eye	Even in cyberspace, the moment can only be described as surreal. Two thousand Apple computer loyalists greet the return of their hero and Apple co-founder, Steven Jobs, at a Boston trade show, only to gasp as the looming picture of Apple's archenemy, Bill Gates of Microsoft, appears on a huge on-stage screen. It was Mr. Gates, after all, who copied Apple's visionary point-and-click system of computer commands, marketed it far more aggressively and successfully, and drove Apple to near-collapse. Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs announced that Microsoft would inject more than $150 million into Apple and take other steps to guarantee Apple's near-term survival. Some Apple zealots in the audience hooted. Others sighed in relief. Virtually all were surprised and confused. Even in cyberspace it is odd for one company to bail out its only rival in a key area of business. Between them, Microsoft and Apple sell the operating systems, which dictate how computers analyze and display information, that run virtually every personal computer.
8/7/1997	Apple's Worst Enemy No More	Robert X Cringely Op-Ed article holds Microsoft Corp deal to aid rival Apple Computer Inc involves mutual self-interest; cites big profit Microsoft makes on software for Apple computers; hails change in makeup of Apple board (M)
8/7/1997	Microsoft Comes to the Aid of a Struggling Apple	In a stunning alliance that could alter the map of the computer industry and help insure the survival of Apple Computer Inc., the company announced a financial and business partnership today with its archrival, the Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft, whose personal computer operating system software has long been the dominant alternative to Apple's Macintosh software, agreed today to invest $150 million for a nonvoting minority stake in Apple. The companies -- whose advocates in the PC industry and user communities are divided into almost cultlike camps -- also agreed to cooperate on several sales and technology fronts.
8/7/1997	True Believers Seem Resigned To Alliance	This year's Boston Macworld Exhibition is running true to form: a cacophonous mix of sideshow hucksterism, computer geek convocation and religious revival. Apple Computer Inc., the quirky Cupertino, Calif., computer maker, has always had a huge camp following of devout Macintosh users whose commitment to their machine has been akin to religious zeal. Among the faithful, the pantheon of heroes has long included Stephen Wozniak and Steven P. Jobs, the fathers of the company's Apple II and Macintosh technologies. The villain has been the Microsoft Corporation's chairman, William H. Gates, whose Windows operating system juggernaut has left ever less room for alternatives in the computer industry.
8/7/1997	Jobs's Team And Name Are on the Line	Little more than a week ago, as Steven P. Jobs was becoming more and more involved in running Apple Computer Inc., the Silicon Valley rumor mill had him ready to step in as chairman and chief executive of the company he had co-founded. Not so, Mr. Jobs said in a brief telephone conversation. He explained that taking on the rehabilitation challenge at Apple full time would play havoc with his family life and that he already had a full-time job at Pixar Inc. -- the computer animation studio behind the film ''Toy Story'' -- a company he founded and heads.
8/7/1997	Computer Industry In the Apple Camp	If Apple Computer fails now, it won't be from lack of industry support. Yesterday's announcements of a reconstituted board of directors and an alliance with the Microsoft Corporation places virtually every major computer hardware and software company -- many of which are at war with each other -- into the Apple camp.
8/7/1997	After Microsoft, Apple Computer plans a second reunion, with an ally from '1984' fame.	FIRST, Apple Computer Inc. united with an old enemy by agreeing to cooperate with the Microsoft Corporation. Next, the troubled maker of Apple computers plans to reunite with an old ally. Barring some last-minute hitch, Apple is expected to announce tomorrow that it will return responsibilities for its American advertising, with billings estimated at $80 million to $90 million, to TBWA Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif. A predecessor agency, Chiat/Day, handled those duties from 1983 until 1986, when Apple dismissed Chiat/Day in favor of the BBDO West unit of BBDO Worldwide in Los Angeles. Both TBWA Chiat/ Day and BBDO Worldwide are owned by Omnicom Group.
8/1/1997	Jobs Is Said to Have Found the Executive Apple of His Eye	Steven P. Jobs, who stepped up his role as an adviser at Apple Computer three weeks ago, has been trying -- unsuccessfully so far -- to persuade Eastman Kodak's chief executive, George M. C. Fisher, to come to Apple, according to an executive who knows both men. As recently as two weeks ago Mr. Fisher said publicly that he had no desire to leave Kodak, after reports that he had been approached about the possibility of taking the top spot at AT&T.
7/23/1997	APPLE HIRES HEIDRICK & STRUGGLES FOR EXECUTIVE SEARCH	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it had hired Heidrick & Struggles Inc., an executive search firm based in Chicago, to help the struggling computer maker find a new chief executive. The company said it could not commit to a specific time frame, but such a search ''is typically expected to take about 90 days.'' Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said Heidrick & Struggles would work closely with a search committee established by the company's board. Earlier this month, Apple removed Gilbert F. Amelio as chairman and chief executive.
7/17/1997	3d-Quarter Loss at Apple Computer Is Smaller Than Expected	A battered Apple Computer Inc. surprised analysts today, reporting a smaller-than-expected loss and allaying fears that the company was on the verge of collapse. The company's loss grew to $56 million, or 44 cents a share, in the most recent quarter, which ended on June 27, from $32 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Still, that was significantly better than the 61 cents a share that analysts surveyed by First Call had expected.
7/14/1997	Apple's executive MacMath: The greater the loss, the greater the salary.	''KLEPTOCRACY'' is a harsh word, but it is the term that some disgusted employees have been using to describe the governance of Apple Computer Inc. over the last few years -- and especially now, when the company is in a mortal struggle for its existence. What they lament is a style of leadership, practiced by the company's board and three different chief executives in less than four years, that has allowed its revolving-door management to leave with increasingly large sums of cash even as the company's losses mount and its share price craters.
7/14/1997	Apple Getting Reactions On the Web	Last week was yet another episode in the soap opera ''as the apple turns,'' also known as the continuing saga of Apple Computers. News of the forced resignation of its chief executive, Gilbert Amelio, last Wednesday could not have been a cause for rejoicing among many of the devotees of the company and its operating system: whatever emotions an individual executive may generate, the turnover of three chief executives in four years is seldom good news for any company.
7/11/1997	Who Will Answer When Apple Calls?	Wanted: a chief executive to run a deeply troubled personal computer company with shrinking market share, mounting losses and some of the world's fiercest competitors. Who will step forward for the most thankless job in the computer industry?
7/10/1997	Apple Computer Ousts Chief In Response to Poor Results	With its sales sliding steadily, Apple Computer Inc. announced yesterday the resignation of its chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio -- a surprising move that casts doubt on whether the company that pioneered the personal computer industry can be revived. The abrupt ouster of Mr. Amelio, who was hailed as a turnaround specialist when he was named Apple's chairman a year and a half ago, is the latest unsettling development for a company whose recent history has often resembled a corporate soap opera. And like a soap opera, yesterday's resignation left many important questions unanswered: It is unclear whether the move signals a new direction in the turnaround effort or even who will guide the company.
6/27/1997	Apple Computer is seeking to burnish its results by finding a new agency for its domestic account.	THEY say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, but a big bite of the Apple Computer Inc. account has finally fallen from its longtime perch. Apple, struggling to reverse a severe slump in sales and profits, said yesterday that it would begin a review on the largest portion of its worldwide account: the domestic duties, with billings estimated at $80 million to $90 million, handled since 1986 by BBDO West.
6/25/1997	Simply a Better Machine	To the Editor: Nowhere in your June 24 Science Times article on Dr. Michael L. Dertouzos is there any mention of the ''simpler'' personal computer that has been available to consumers for years: Apple's Macintosh.
6/19/1997	Jobs Registers To Sell Shares	Steven P. Jobs has registered to sell all but one of the 1.5 million shares of Apple Computer that he acquired when he agreed in December to sell Next Software to Apple for $400 million. Since the acquisition, Mr. Jobs has served as a part-time adviser to Apple, which he cofounded. Mr. Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985.
5/23/1997	Apple to Spin Off Newton Unit As Wholly Owned Subsidiary	Ending months of speculation about its Newton hand-held computer division, Apple Computer Inc. announced yesterday that it would spin off the division into a wholly owned subsidiary, presumably to better attract a buyer for it. ''They're dressing it up for sale,'' said Kimball Brown, a computer industry analyst with Dataquest of San Jose, Calif.
5/21/1997	Another Ranking Executive At Apple Decides to Resign	In the latest senior management departure from struggling Apple Computer Inc., George Scalise, the company's executive vice president for operations, resigned today to become president of the Semiconductor Industry Association. He will leave Apple at the end of the month. Mr. Scalise, 63, had followed Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's chairman and chief executive, to the company from the National Semiconductor Corporation and had earlier in his career held executive positions at Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor and Motorola. Mr. Scalise had also previously worked for the Semiconductor Industry Association, the chip industry's trade organization, as chairman of its public policy committee.
5/13/1997	Apple to Preview New Operating System	Apple Computer Inc., still trying to find the comeback trail, will reach a crucial milestone on Tuesday, when the company demonstrates an early version of the new operating system software on which Apple is staking its future. The demonstration will come at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference. There, the faithful and the skeptical will convene for a first look at the operating system, code-named Rhapsody, that Apple hopes will restore the company's reputation for software that is as innovative as it is easy to use.
4/30/1997	Head of Oracle Halts Bid to Buy Apple Computer	A quest by the chairman and chief executive of the Oracle Corporation, Lawrence J. Ellison, to acquire Apple Computer Inc. came to an abrupt -- if temporary -- halt late today, when he issued a statement saying that for the moment he had decided not to buy the troubled computer maker. But in a one-paragraph statement, issued from Mr. Ellison's Atherton, Calif., home, the billionaire software entrepreneur, raised as many questions as it answered.
4/28/1997	Erosion of Apple Image Extends to Music Scene	For years, Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computers have been losing battles to machines using chips from the Intel Corporation. Now Apple seems to have thrown in the towel in an especially visible arena: the lower Manhattan music scene. The Macintosh New York Music Festival, which attracted thousands of fans over the last two summers, has become the Intel New York Music Festival.
4/28/1997	Strong Growth in PC Industry, Reports Say	Despite Wall Street anxieties about the market for home computers, the personal computer industry over all continues to show strong growth, according to two reports to be issued on Monday. Figures from both Dataquest Inc. and the International Data Corporation indicate that the personal computer industry grew by about 16 percent worldwide during this year's first quarter, compared with last year's period.
4/22/1997	EXPONENTIAL SAYS DEFECT TO DELAY CHIP PRODUCTION	Exponential Technology Inc., a closely held computer chip maker partly owned by Apple Computer Inc. and UMAX Data Systems, said yesterday that a design defect would delay production of its highest-speed chips. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., had planned to ship the chips by July. They run at speeds of 500 megahertz, about twice the speed of current processors. Richard Bergman, Exponential's vice president of marketing, said, ''We're really pushing the edge and sometimes you break things.'' Apple played down the delay. ''We haven't announced any specific products'' using Exponential chips, said Russell Brady, a spokesman for Apple.
4/17/1997	Apple Computer Posts Loss; Sale Advice May Be Sought	As expected, Apple Computer Inc. reported a big loss yesterday for its second fiscal quarter. Sales fell from the previous quarter and from the corresponding one a year earlier, but Apple executives said demand had picked up and that the company now had a significant backlog of orders. Still, the loss, which was reported after the close of the stock market, was bigger than analysts had expected. The company's shares closed yesterday at $18.5625, up 12.5 cents, on the Nasdaq.
4/15/1997	The Lightness of Being Newton	I AM writing this column with its subject, the Newton Mes sagepad 2000 from Apple Computer Inc. It is a direct descendant of the original Newton, the pen-based hand-held computer widely ridiculed for its perversely hilarious attempts at turning people's block printing into computerized text. So why does the opening sentence not read ''I an Uriting this Co/snn lit3 its Subjait. tha Nanton MassogcrPcd Zooo,'' which is how this new model recognized my scrawl? Because I cheated and used the keyboard.
4/9/1997	Apple Faces A Showdown With I.B.M.	In a showdown that could portend the final blow to the shaky personal computing alliance between Apple Computer and I.B.M., the two companies plan on Wednesday to try renegotiating license fees for Apple's Macintosh operating system software. Apple, financially troubled and struggling to find a turnaround strategy, has shown signs lately of regretting the decision two years ago to let various other companies clone its Macintosh computers. And so it has proposed raising Macintosh license fees as much as tenfold, in an attempt to slow the clones' erosion of Apple's own sales.
4/7/1997	Apple Offers a New Macintosh Line	Apple Computer Inc. on Friday introduced the Power Mac 6500, a line of Macintosh machines intended to replace the Performa line for students, home and small-business customers. With prices from $2,000 to $3,000, the computers offer processor speeds of as much as 300 megahertz, the fastest currently offered in a personal computer. Analysts said the new machines could provide Apple some much-needed sizzle at a time when the company is broadly perceived to be on the ropes.
4/4/1997	Saudi Prince Sees Promise In Apple Stake	Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who has acquired slightly more than 5 percent of Apple Computer, said today that he had looked at more than 10 technology companies in the last year and believed that Apple had an ''incredible franchise, loyal customers and actually a very cheap price.'' In two telephone interviews from his farm about 50 miles east of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, the prince said he was keeping ''all options open'' with regard to his Apple stake. He emphasized that he was neither opposed to Apple's management nor to Larry Ellison, the chairman of the Oracle Corporation, who has said he is considering a takeover bid for Apple.
4/3/1997	Apple Is Said To Be Seeking Friendly Deal	Apple Computer Inc. is actively looking for a friendly merger candidate, several executives close to the company said today. The disclosure of a search for a partner came to light shortly after another strange twist to what may become the end-game for the troubled computer maker.
4/2/1997	Saudi Arabian Prince Says He Bought Stake in Apple	Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia has purchased more than 5 percent of the shares of Apple Computer Inc. The prince, a prominent international investor with large stakes in T.W.A., Citicorp, Euro Disney and several hotel chains, said early today that he purchased the Apple shares ''over the last several weeks for an aggregate investment of $115 million.''
3/28/1997	Oracle Seeks Public Views On Possible Bid for Apple	Should Larry Ellison, the chairman and chief executive of the Oracle Corporation, buy Apple Computer Inc.? Anyone who wishes to advise him can do so on the Internet, at savapple@us.oracle.com. Mr. Ellison has mused publicly about taking over the ailing Apple on various occasions since April 1995, and did so again in an interview published today in The San Jose Mercury News. Now Oracle, which had heretofore maintained that such speculation was Mr. Ellison's personal business, has taken the unusual step of setting up an Internet polling booth where customers, employees, competitors and anyone else can vote on the prospect.
3/15/1997	Apple to Trim Jobs and Its Product Line	Saying it was finally turning a corner, but leaving many questions unanswered, Apple Computer Inc. announced today that it would lay off 4,100 employees and temporary workers. Apple will take charges totaling $250 million over the next three quarters to pay for the job cuts. The layoffs represent about 30 percent of the company's total work force of 13,400, but they were less than what many analysts had expected. Apple has been struggling to stem the hemorrhage in its business for more than a year, and after a disastrous Christmas quarter last year, it has been facing a chorus of critics who have increasingly raised doubts about Apple's ability to survive.
3/5/1997	APPLE CHAIRMAN TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF REVAMPING	Gilbert F. Amelio, the chairman of Apple Computer Inc., told employees yesterday that he would announce details on March 14 of the company's long-expected plan to cut jobs and costs. Katie Cotton, a spokeswoman for Apple, said that Mr. Amelio would specify the number of jobs to be cut and the amount of any charge for severance payments and that he would name any units to be sold or closed. The personal computer maker is trying to reduce expenses by $400 million, or 25 percent, as its sales plummet. Analysts have estimated that as many as 5,000 of Apple's 13,500 workers could be cut.
2/19/1997	Apple Official Resigns Amid Reshuffling	Marco Landi, the executive who was Apple Computer Inc.'s chief operating officer until the company reshuffled its top management earlier this month, has resigned, the company said late today. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it was reorganizing its sales organization in an effort to create a flatter and more centralized sales force reporting directly to Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's chairman.
2/17/1997	A Fast Notebook Is Among Apple's New Products	Apple Computer Inc. will ship several new products today, including a Powerbook model that will give the company the right to claim the world's fastest notebook computer. Apple is also shipping new and faster Power Macs, two new Newton devices and a digital camera. The Powerbook 3400, which Apple executives said on Friday would be in stores this week, has microprocessor speeds of 180 or 200 megahertz, with a 240-megahertz version due in April. These speeds compare with 150 megahertz for the fastest notebook computers equipped with the Intel Pentium chip. The Powerbook 3400 will be priced at $4,500 to $6,500, depending on configuration.
2/16/1997	The Work-at-Home Executive	To the Editor: Re ''Job? Kids? A Sad Route to a Happy Balance'' (Jan. 12), which discussed the journey of Mike Zisman from high-powered chief executive of Lotus Development to a lesser role that lets him become a ''Mr. Mom'':
2/11/1997	A Top-10 List Not Too Many Care to Be On	As if Gilbert Amelio, the chief executive of Apple Computer, and Paul Fireman, the chief executive of Reebok International, did not have their hands full already, the public pressure for improved stock performance is about to grow. Both companies are on a list that the huge California Public Employees Retirement System plans to release today of its 10 target companies for 1997. The other companies on the list compiled by Calpers, as the $108 billion state pension fund is known, are Novell, Bassett Furniture Industries, Fleming Companies, Rollins Environmental Services, Sensormatic Electronics, Stride Rite, Summit Technology and Sybase.
2/11/1997	Apple to Take Big Write-Off On Acquisition	In two moves underscoring the extent of Apple Computer's planned corporate overhaul, the company said today that it would incur a huge loss this quarter to reflect the cost of acquiring Next Software Inc. and that its executive in charge of courting outside software allies would leave the company after only a year in the job. Apple said it would take a $322 million write-off for acquiring Next, which it agreed to buy in December in an effort to create fundamentally new software technology for Apple's aging Macintosh computer line. The company also said it would pay about $30 million more for Next than the $400 million previously estimated.
2/6/1997	Apple Chief Executive Seeks More Time to Aid Company	Gilbert F. Amelio gave the best speech of his one-year tenure as chief executive of Apple Computer Inc. today, persuading frustrated shareholders to give him more time to turn around the troubled computer company. Mr. Amelio's speech, before an audience of about 500 shareholders, employees and journalists, was given on his first anniversary of joining Apple, which has seen its stock price plummet and which had a huge $867 million loss in 1996.
2/5/1997	Some Shifts At Apple, But No Layoffs or Unit Sales Yet	Apple Computer Inc. shifted its top management today but failed to announce its much-anticipated reorganization, as company officials conceded that they were still not ready to say if they would lay off more workers or sell any units. Apple did announce that both of its co-founders, Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, would join its executive committee as advisers to Gilbert F. Amelio, the company's chairman and chief executive.
2/3/1997	Apple Plan to Cut Costs 25% Might Include Significant Layoffs	Apple Computer Inc. will disclose the details of its restructuring plan this week as the struggling company tries to cut its costs by 25 percent. The plan is expected to include substantial layoffs. Under the plan, an executive close to the company said, Apple will divide into three groups to better focus on its core markets in education, publishing and graphics, and the Internet.
1/26/1997	For Investors, Is It Time to Bite?	IN the investment community, Nick Whitridge is a lonely voice -- an Apple enthusiast. A senior vice president of David L. Babson & Company, Mr. Whitridge has bought more than 800,000 Apple shares for the Babson Value Fund and the firm's other accounts in the last 18 months. Mr. Whitridge has kept buying Apple shares through its travails of the last year. His average cost, at year-end, was $26 a share, and he has even bought some more Apple shares this year. At the company's closing price of $16.875 on Friday, the shares have scarcely been a bargain.
1/26/1997	The Incredible Shrinking Apple Computer	IT was intended as a flashy display of futuristic technology, as proof that Apple Computer Inc., though troubled and humbled, could still deliver the old magic, a truly distinctive computer. The audience could not have been more receptive -- some 4,000 Apple loyalists packed into the cavernous ballroom of the San Francisco Marriott on Jan. 7 for the annual Macworld computer conference. In good years, these gatherings are celebrations. But this year, with Apple reeling from losses and cutbacks, the Macworld conclave was an effort to revive the sorely tested beliefs of the Apple faithful.
1/16/1997	Apple Reports a Loss of $120 Million for First Quarter	Apple Computer Inc. posted a loss of $120 million for its first quarter today and said that it does not expect to return to profitability as quickly as it had predicted, with the first positive earnings not aniticipated until the fourth quarter in September. Separately, Sun Microsystems Inc., which a year ago entertained the prospect of acquiring Apple, reported record revenues and earnings for its second quarter, exceeding analyst estimates.
1/13/1997	At Macworld, Apple failed to regain believers among the once-faithful.	AT a time when Apple Computer most needed to send a message of confidence and clarity, its performance at last week's Macworld exposition in San Francisco offered little evidence that it had begun digging itself out of its very deep hole. Macworld is a semiannual event where thousands of loyal Apple customers and software developers gather to pore over the Macintosh industry's latest offerings. This time, they also came to gauge whether Apple would survive: Another gloomy financial forecast had sent Apple's stock price plunging the week before.
1/12/1997	Creating Jobs	On a soft november day in northern california, steve jobs is guiding his gray Porsche convertible out of San Francisco, and he is talking about Apple Computer Inc. That, of course, is what Jobs is famous for: as a co-founder of Apple in 1976, he was a leader of the computer revolution, until he was ousted in 1985 in a board-room coup. Jobs was 30, and he walked away with $150 million but no small measure of hurt. As he negotiates the Friday afternoon traffic on Route 101, Jobs keeps insisting that he does not want to talk about Apple. Then he goes on at length about how the company needs to reinvent itself, how it needs to regain its lost mantle as the personal computer industry's leading innovator. He is intimate but elusive, and undeniably articulate. He recalls his years at Apple fondly, then makes it clear that he is doing nothing more than reminiscing. After all, he has other things to worry about, like running Pixar, the digital-animation studio that created ''Toy Story,'' and overseeing Next, the computer-software company he started when he left Apple.
1/8/1997	BUSINESS DIGEST	Apple Invokes Its Past While Outlining Its Future Apple Computer's chairman, Gilbert F. Amelio, left, invoked the company's past as it outlined its plans for the future. On the opening day of its Macworld computer show, Apple re-united the company's two founders, Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, for the first time at the company since 1984 and discussed plans for a new operating system, called Rhapsody. $(D2.$) Stocks Rise to Another Record A late turnaround pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to another record as bargain-hunting investors shrugged off rising interest rates.

1/8/1997	Saying It Has a Future, Apple Puts Its Past on the Podium	Apple Computer invoked its past today as it outlined its plans for a new computer operating system. On the opening day of the Macworld computer conference here, Apple sought to portray itself as an embattled underdog working to regain its role as software innovator. Summoning a metaphor, it ran a clip from the film ''Independence Day'' showing an embattled planet. And invoking a happier past, it reunited the company's two founders, Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, for the first time at a company event since 1984.
1/7/1997	Apple Stock Battered by Forecast of Loss	Apple Computer Inc.'s shares were hammered today, falling nearly 18 percent following the company's disclosure on Friday that it would report a loss of $100 million to $150 million in what is typically its strongest quarter. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., had been hoping for strong holiday sales, but the announcement on Friday suggested that a yearlong turnaround effort by the company's chairman, Gilbert F. Amelio, may be falling short. Wall Street reacted strongly today, driving the computer maker's stock down $3.875 a share to $17.875 in Nasdaq trading.
1/4/1997	Apple Expects A Big Loss For Quarter	Apple Computer Inc. said late today that it expected to report a loss of $100 million to $150 million for its most recent quarter, a much sharper loss than analysts had expected. Apple cited weakness of demand for its Performa line of consumer-oriented Macintosh computers, and short supply of its Powerbook portable machines.
12/31/1996	In Changing Times, Whither Apple?	IN January 1984, just before he demonstrated the new Macintosh personal computer to Apple Computer Inc.'s board of directors for the first time, Steve Jobs recited a line from the Bob Dylan song ''The Times They Are A-Changin'.'' In his book ''Insanely Great,'' a history of the Macintosh computer, Steven Levy recounts the event but does not disclose which one of Dylan's lines was uttered. It is just as well, because the times they are a-changing once again, and the song is as appropriate today as it was nearly 13 years ago.
12/30/1996	Apple Seeing Mixed Results From Cloning	Sean Anker, chief engineer for Innovative Edit, a video production company based in Indianapolis, recently decided to stay with a technology that many business people have fled: Macintosh computers. But instead of an Apple machine, he bought a Macintosh clone from the Umax Computer Corporation, a tiny start-up company based in Fremont, Calif. ''It absolutely screams in terms of speed,'' Mr. Anker said of his Umax SuperMac S900L model, purchased for about $3,000 -- some $500 less than a comparable Power Macintosh 9500 from Apple Computer would have cost. ''And it holds up well for video work and image editing,'' he said.
12/23/1996	Why Apple Sees Next as a Match Made in Heaven	Sometimes breaking the rules works best. Despite her reputation as a stuffy corporate manager, Apple Computer's chief technical officer, Ellen Hancock, picked up the telephone in mid-November and returned a call from an unknown marketing manager at Next Software Inc.
12/22/1996	Apple Hopes Its Founder Rediscovers His Old Magic	In May 1985 a dejected Steven P. Jobs stood at the back of a small company meeting at Apple Computer and said, ''I guess I don't wear the right kind of pants for this company anymore.'' Mr. Jobs, who had become a jeans-clad American hero by helping found Apple in a Silicon Valley garage in 1976, had collided with a buttoned-down executive and lost one of the most dramatic battles for corporate control in history, just a year and a half after the introduction of the Macintosh computer.
12/21/1996	Steven Jobs Making Move Back to Apple	In a daring gamble to revitalize itself, Apple Computer Inc. announced tonight that its co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, would return to the company to help create an operating system based in part on the technology he developed after resigning 11 years ago. Apple is also acquiring Mr. Jobs's company, Next Software Inc., for $350 million in cash and stock and will assume about $50 million in debt.
12/16/1996	Windows NT Chip Support Is Dropped	In a move that shows how efforts by I.B.M. and Motorola to establish a successful competitor to Intel's Pentium computer chip are flagging, both companies are dropping support for the Windows NT operating system on computers built around their Power PC microprocessor. The decision, which was made last week, leaves Apple Computer's Macintosh line and its clones as the only high-volume desktop computers to use the Power PC chip.
12/11/1996	Alliance Formed Around Sun's Java Network	In a show of strength intended to rally Internet software developers around its Java programming language, the Javasoft division of Sun Microsystems Inc. said yesterday that more than 100 companies -- with the conspicuous exception of the Microsoft Corporation -- were agreeing to more closely adhere to the rules set by Sun on Java network applications. A senior Microsoft executive said last night that to the best of his knowledge, Microsoft had not been invited to join the group.
11/26/1996	Apple Is Beaten to a Pact For Use of Operating System	The Power Computing Corporation, the largest maker of Macintosh clones, has agreed to license a new computer operating system produced by Be Inc., jumping ahead of Apple Computer Inc., which has been seeking an alliance with Be. Be, which is led by Jean-Louis Gassee, a former Apple executive, is a small private company that is trying to create an extremely fast, simple system that controls the look and feel of a computer, stepping ahead of both the Apple and Microsoft systems. Almost every personal computer sold uses one of those operating systems.
11/25/1996	A New Language Is Adding Depth to the Flat Computer Screen	As new business uses for the Internet erupt, the lusterless, two-dimensional computer desktop display is rapidly giving way to a richer, three-dimensional representation that can be simultaneously viewed by dozens or even hundreds of computer users. Electronic shopping malls, real estate tours, businesses, political groups and even professional sports teams are rushing to virtual reality. Science fiction novels like Vernor Vinge's ''True Names,'' William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Neal Stephenson's ''Snow Crash'' introduced the original vision of a shared computerized world, called ''cyberspace'' by Mr. Gibson and the ''metaverse'' by Mr. Stephenson. Beginning in the 1980's, that vision captured the imagination of a generation of computer network designers.
11/19/1996	Solidity, Versatility and Economy	WE were prepared to say nice things about Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh Performa 6400/ 200 computer when all of a sudden Apple cut the price. Now we are compelled to say even nicer things about it. The Performa 6400 is not cheap, either in price or in construction. But when Apple recently cut the suggested list to $2,199, from $2,799, it eliminated our only major criticism of the machine. The result is a solid, fast, versatile and easy-to-use personal computer for the home and small office markets.
11/18/1996	The Companies Want to Know: Like a Little Cyber in Your Cafe?	First they put computers where we work, then they pushed computers where we live. Now, the computer companies are going after us where we eat and drink. Both the Intel Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. are planning to serve their computer technologies to a broader consumer market through technology-themed restaurants and coffee shops.
11/18/1996	Apple Software Leader Quits; New Questions for Company	The executive in charge of Apple Computer's troubled operating systems division for the last two years resigned Friday, raising new questions about the company's ability to sort out its problems and differentiate its Macintosh operating system from Microsoft's Windows 95 program. Isaac Nassi, a veteran computer researcher, came to Apple seven and a half years ago to direct a research project at an Apple laboratory in Cambridge, Mass. He has headed the Applesoft Division for the last two years, during which the Microsoft Corporation has, in the eyes of many executives, closed a software gap where Apple had led commandingly.
11/9/1996	APPLE COMPUTER PLANS TO SIMPLIFY DOMESTIC SALES	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would simplify its domestic sales structure as it tried to improve its sagging sales. The plans include simplifying the company's product offerings, improving the relationship with resellers and giving those resellers wider access to Apple products and marketing support. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., is changing a sales system that ''does not reward those in the channel who are strong advocates of Apple products,'' the company said in a statement. Apple said only that it would encourage retailers who gave Apple products high visibility in their stores. In the last few weeks, Apple has cut prices as much as 30 percent on some product groups.
11/6/1996	APPLE COMPUTER REDUCES THE PRICE ON SOME SERVERS	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it had lowered by 12 percent to 23 percent the price it charges resellers in the United States for its servers based on its Macintosh operating system. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., said the new prices cover products bundled with software for World Wide Web and Internet publishing, Mac OS-based applications and Appleshare file and print services. Servers affected by the price cuts will range in estimated retail price from $1,900 to $6,100. The Compaq Computer Corporation, a seller of personal computers that use the Windows operating system, also cut server prices, reducing the price on selected Compaq Prosignia 300 servers by up to 12 percent.
11/5/1996	No Hot Rod, but a Nice Family Car	IN olden days, when Apple Computer Inc.'s graying senior executives were young and when cool technology was epitomized by hot-rod automobiles instead of computers, it was fashionable in some quarters to paint flames on the side of the car to indicate great speed. There are several reasons not to paint flames on Apple's new Powerbook 1400 portable Macintosh computer. First, it conjures up unpleasant memories of the ill-fated Powerbook 5300 series, which counted among its many quirks a propensity, though a rare one, for spontaneous combustion.
10/28/1996	Hoping to Bolster Its Hold on School Computers, Apple Introduces a Cheaper Model	Hoping to strengthen its foothold in the $4 billion educational computing market, Apple Computer Inc. plans to introduce today a new kind of computer for elementary and high schools that will sell for about half the price of current multimedia systems. The new computer, called the Emate 300, is not based on the Macintosh, which is already the most popular computer system in American classrooms. Instead it borrows technology from the company's Newton line of hand-held computing devices to create a sleek notebook-sized device for Internet browsing, word processing and other basic computing tasks.
10/27/1996	Linked to Apple but Trying to Branch Out	WHILE scores of analysts mull over the fate of troubled Apple Computer, some investors are taking a look instead at companies that are related to Apple. They want to see if those enterprises are as endangered as Wall Street may think. Of course, as Apple's troubles have grown, many companies that make software and other peripherals used in Apple's Macintosh computers have seen their sales plummet. And Apple's problems, including product recalls and delays, are clearly huge. Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30, for instance, was off 23 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
10/21/1996	Face Lift at Apple	Exponential Technology Inc., a small Silicon Valley chip maker, is planning to introduce a new version of the Power PC microprocessor Monday that could well mark the return of Apple Computer Inc. as a personal-computer industry innovator in 1997. Apple, along with I.B.M. and Motorola, designed the Power PC chip, and the new chip is likely to give Apple a significant performance advantage over its Intel-based competition in the second half of next year. But it is also a telling reminder that Apple has lost its traditional role as the personal computer industry's hardware design leader, a position it held from 1977 until just recently.
10/19/1996	Apple Introduces 2 More Performas	Apple Computer Inc. introduced two new Macintosh Performa models today and announced price cuts of as much as 20 percent in its consumer line. The cuts came two days after Apple surprised Wall Street with a return to profitability.
10/17/1996	Unexpectedly, Apple Halts String of Losses	Defying Wall Street predictions of yet another money-losing period, Apple Computer Inc. reported a $25 million profit for its fiscal fourth quarter today. The surprisingly strong financial results, which were reported after the close of the market -- and sent Apple's stock price up 7.6 percent, to $28.25 in after-hours trading -- were the best news the company's chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, has been able to report since taking the company's reins last February.
10/8/1996	Changes in Focus Ruled Out by Apple	The chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., Gilbert Amelio, said today that the company planned to focus on making personal computers and shrugged off suggestions that its machines could not compete with ones run on operating systems made by the Microsoft Corporation. ''We have to offer a very distinct choice,'' Mr. Amelio said at a panel discussion of executives of high-technology companies at a conference in Lake Buena Vista. ''Our focus has been and will continue to be on the end user and not the people in between.'' The conference was sponsored by Gartner Group.
10/2/1996	Apple Officer Sees Return to Profitability	The chief financial officer of Apple Computer Inc. said today that the company could return to profitability as soon as December as a turnaround plan improves Apple's gross margin. ''We are still confident we can return to profitability no later than March,'' the executive, Fred Anderson, said in an interview. ''Could it happen sooner than that? Yes.'' Apple had previously said it would be profitable by the end of March.
9/17/1996	Motorola Introducing PC's With Apple System	Motorola plans today to introduce a line of personal computers equipped with Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh operating system, as the companies bid to expand the market for such machines at a time when it is threatened by I.B.M.-compatible computers running Microsoft Windows software. The new line, called Starmax, will be priced from $1,600 to $4,000 and aimed at business customers.
9/13/1996	Apple and Hewlett In Printer Talks	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it had entered discussions with the Hewlett-Packard Company to collaborate on the development of ink-jet printers. The printers would be made by Hewlett-Packard to Apple specifications, and would be sold under the Apple logo through Apple dealers. Hewlett-Packard is the largest maker of ink-jet printers, with more than 60 percent of the worldwide market. If an agreement was reached, Apple would discontinue its practice of reselling ink-jet printers made by Canon Ltd. under the Apple logo, although it would continue to sell replacement ink cartridges and laser printers made by Canon. Although the Apple Stylewriter line of ink-jet machines has essentially consisted of relabeled Canon printers, Apple plans to add more Macintosh technology to the printers made by Hewlett-Packard. The new printers would be available within 9 to 12 months, Apple said.
9/9/1996	Be, a novel start-up, can offer software to Apple beyond conventional systems.	INSIDE the beleaguered Apple Computer Inc., a comment is often heard about the appointment earlier this year of Gilbert F. Amelio as chairman and president: ''Thank God there's finally some adult supervision around here.'' But seven months after Mr. Amelio's rise to power at the troubled computer maker, it is clear that simply putting a grown-up in charge is not enough to provide the tectonic shift that Apple now needs.
8/14/1996	APPLE COMPUTER TO LOWER ITS SPENDING ON RESEARCH	Apple Computer Inc. planned to cut the percentage of revenue it spends on research, according to Ellen Hancock, vice president for research. The cost control measures include freezing research staffing and possibly charging customers for software that is now given away free. Ms. Hancock said yesterday that Apple's president, Gilbert F. Amelio, had given senior executives orders to lower research spending. ''He has given us specific targets,'' she said, while declining to elaborate on the targets. Unlike most personal computer makers, Apple designs its own hardware and operating system software. Analysts estimate Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., spends about 6 percent of total sales on research. In the quarter that ended in June, Apple's sales were $2.2 billion.
8/13/1996	Apple's Best Hope: On-Line Sales	AFTER six months on the job, Heidi Roizen, a former software developer who is now Apple Computer Inc.'s head of developer relations, says she has identified Apple's biggest problem. ''It's the perception of future risk, not the reality of what's happening now,'' Ms. Roizen said. ''People are worried about Apple. They are worried that the application they need either isn't available or won't be available. They wonder, 'How much can I depend on Apple to be there in the future when I need them?' ''
8/9/1996	For Motorola, Computer Lead	Motorola Inc. said today that it expected to ship computers based on the Power PC platform in the first quarter of 1997, beating Apple Computer Inc. in offering machines that run Macintosh software as well as Microsoft's Windows NT. Apple said on Wednesday that its comparable machines would not be available until the second half of next year.
8/9/1996	Chief of Apple Computer Soothes the Jittery Faithful	If there is to be a comeback by Apple Computer, it may be led by true believers like William C. Wantz, a lawyer from Hagerstown, Md., and his 12-year-old son Toby. Mr. Wantz bought his first Apple Macintosh when his son was still an infant, and now he and Toby were at the head of a quarter-mile-long line of faithful Mac-heads waiting to hear Apple's new chief executive, Gilbert Amelio, deliver a crucial keynote address to the Macworld convention, which began here Wednesday and will end Saturday.
8/8/1996	Apple Computer Shifts Course on Its New Operating System	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had scrapped plans for a major upgrade of its flagship Macintosh operating system software next year, and would instead roll out key features of the new code on a regular but piecemeal basis from now on. The fundamental shift in strategy, disclosed at the Macworld computer conference here, comes as Apple is struggling to remain competitive in the computer marketplace, especially in the face of the increasing dominance of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.
8/3/1996	NEW POWER MACINTOSH LINE OF COMPUTERS IS DISPLAYED	Apple Computer Inc. yesterday displayed a Power Macintosh line of computers based on the Power PC 604e chip. The line offers speeds of as much as 200 megahertz and all models now include 8X-speed CD-ROM drives. The line includes Apple's first multiprocessing desktop model, which features dual Power PC 604e processors running at 180 MHz to improve performance on compute-intensive tasks. The Power Macintosh 9500/200 includes a 200 MHz chip and will be fully available in September for an estimated price of $4,899. The multiprocessing model, the 9500/180MP will ship in September and will retail for $5,699. The Power Macintosh 8500/180 includes a 180 MHz chip and will be fully available in September for $4,499.
7/18/1996	Apple Surprises Wall Street by Cutting Losses	Defying gloomy predictions from Wall Street that have sent its stock to its lowest point in 10 years, Apple Computer reported a surprisingly small quarterly loss yesterday and said that it had stemmed a slide in its revenues. The results were helped by a one-time after-tax gain of $39 million from the sale of stock in America Online Inc.
7/10/1996	Market Place;People close to Apple don't rule out a sale of some of its parts.	ARE slices of Apple Computer up for sale? Just five months after Apple's board spurned a takeover bid by Sun Microsystems and chose, instead, to hire Gilbert F. Amelio as chairman and chief executive, Mr. Amelio's turnaround prospects look increasingly grim.
7/4/1996	Apple Names Technology Chief and Puzzles Many	Five months after beginning his overhaul of Apple Computer Inc., Gilbert F. Amelio put in place today the final -- and, perhaps, most crucial -- piece of the new management team that hopes to return Apple to its former position as the computer industry's top technological innovator. But in naming Apple's new chief technology officer today, Mr. Amelio left much of the industry puzzled by his choice.
6/28/1996	Taking Business To the Movies	"Apple Computer Inc. is going to the movies again with a campaign tied to the 20th Century Fox film """"Independence Day,"""" which is being modeled on an Apple campaign last month tied to the Paramount Pictures film """"Mission: Impossible."""" Separately, Mercedes-Benz is joining with MCA/Universal and Amblin Entertainment for worldwide marketing and promotions for the movie """"The Lost World,"""" the sequel to """"Jurassic Park."""" An Apple commercial that begins running tomorrow, created by the BBDO West unit of the Omnicom Group in Los Angeles, features scenes from """"Independence Day,"""" which Fox, owned by the News Corporation, will release on Tuesday.In those clips, the actor Jeff Goldblum, playing a computer programmer, uses an Apple Powerbook to help repel an alien invasion of Earth. The spot carries the theme """"The power to save the world."
6/27/1996	Deal for Power Computing	The Power Computing Corporation, the first company to license Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh operating system, has been awarded a contract to replace or upgrade 3,000 older Apple computers of Lockheed Martin Astronautics. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
6/25/1996	Microsoft Hires 2 Apple Software Writers	The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had hired two key software designers from Apple Computer Inc. to work on its chief software products, adding to its roster of star computer scientists. Steve Capps, one of the original software designers of the Macintosh personal computer, and Walter Smith, who designed the software for Apple's Newton hand-held computer, plan to work in Microsoft's Internet platform and tools division.
6/11/1996	Executive Changes	APPLE COMPUTER INC., Cupertino, Calif., said James Groff, who left this year, had rejoined the company as senior vice president and head of the new Internet appliance unit.
6/6/1996	Co-Author of Macintosh Program Quits Apple	The software engineer who was co-author of the program that gave Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh its distinctive look and feel, and who represented the current company's most direct link to its early innovative tradition, has left the company. The engineer, Steven Capps, who was one of a core of technical employees with the mandate to chart Apple's technological future, said today that he had resigned on Monday.
6/5/1996	Apple Plans An Offering Of 6% Notes	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would offer $575 million in convertible debt, in what analysts called a positive step by the troubled company to raise cash. Apple's offering was announced as Treasury prices recovered from an early slide to end slightly higher for the first time in three sessions.
5/22/1996	APPLE NAMES LANDI AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT	Apple Computer Inc. yesterday named Marco Landi, an Apple executive in Europe, to the post of executive vice president and chief operating officer. Mr. Landi, 52, is currently president of Apple Computer Europe, Middle East and Africa. He plans to assume his new position on June 1, overseeing four newly formed product divisions, worldwide sales, marketing and manufacturing operations. Analysts said Mr. Landi would be a welcome addition to the management team because of his solid reputation in Europe and his familiarity with the company and its woes.
5/14/1996	Apple Unveils Strategic Plan Of Small Steps	Anyone hoping to hear a grand rescue plan for Apple Computer Inc. probably came away disappointed. But 100 days after being given the job of leading Apple out of the financial desert, Gilbert F. Amelio, in his first public strategy speech, said today that the company's comeback path would consist of many small steps -- rather than the single bold move he said the news media might be expecting.
5/13/1996	Former Chief Executive Offers Apple Encouragement and Says OldStrategy Can Still Work	"The financially troubled Apple Computer Inc. has received a vote of confidence from its former chairman, John Sculley, who argues in an article in the current issue of a Silicon Valley magazine that the """"hot-product"""" marketing strategy that made Apple the nation's leading personal computer maker in the late 1980's and early 1990's can still work. Mr. Sculley's comments come at a time when Apple's new chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, is preparing to offer a new strategy for saving the company. Mr. Amelio will outline the strategy Monday at an annual Apple developers meeting to be held at the San Jose Convention Center."
5/10/1996	Apple Plans to Repair Problems Of Some Macintosh Computers	Apple Computer Inc., already facing falling sales and big losses, agreed today to repair problems with some models of Macintosh desktop and portable computers. Apple said that it had asked distributors and dealers to return flawed Powerbook portables, and it said it would ask individual owners to take flawed desktop models -- they include many Performa models and a few Power Mac models -- to authorized service providers nearby for free repairs. It said customers with defective laptops would eventually be asked to ship them to a central repair facility. The company said computer owners may call (800) SOS-APPL.
5/7/1996	Apple Licenses Macintosh System to I.B.M.	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had licensed its Macintosh operating system to the International Business Machines Corporation in an effort to prop up its shrinking market share.
4/23/1996	Apple Shows New Computers	Apple Computer Inc. introduced four new Power PC personal computers today with faster processors as the troubled computer maker tries to spur more interest in its products.
4/23/1996	The Joys of Mac Color Scanning	EVEN without opening the box, one can guess that the new Apple color scanner is not flawless. If it were, someone at Apple Computer Inc. might have used it to scan in a bunch of $20's and $50's (the new $100 bills are harder to counterfeit) and then send them to a color laser printer to help offset the company's financial losses. Wait! Only kidding. It is illegal for anyone but the Government and certain Internet start-up companies to manufacture money.
4/18/1996	More Job Cuts Set at Apple As Loss Exceeds Estimates	Burdened by its own internal turmoil and a broad slowdown in personal computer sales, Apple Computer Inc. reported a $740 million loss for the second quarter, somewhat larger than it had predicted a month ago. The company also said that it would eliminate another 1,500 jobs in the next 12 months, in addition to the 1,300 job cuts previously announced. Some analysts had been expecting far more drastic cuts, and it seemed unlikely that today's announcement about job cuts, made after the stock market closed, would restore confidence in the struggling computer maker.
4/16/1996	Apple, With Losses Rising, Loses Its Head of Research	Apple Computer Inc., in the midst of a corporate make-over, announced the resignation yesterday of its longtime head of research and development. The executive, David C. Nagel, is leaving Apple after eight years to head the newly formed AT&T Laboratories, a research organization created from a group of scientists and engineers that AT&T retained from its recently spun-off Bell Laboratories unit.
4/10/1996	I.B.M. and Apple Reported Near Licensing Agreement	I.B.M.'s chip-making division and Apple Computer Inc. are said to be close to concluding a licensing deal for Apple's Macintosh software operating system. But while Apple's stock rose today on news of the talks, industry executives said they did not expect -- as many investors apparently did -- that the agreement would lead to the manufacture of Macintosh clones by I.B.M. or any other major computer maker.
4/9/1996	Bridging the Mac-Windows Gap	THE human race has functioned fairly well for thousands of years despite a large number of operating system incompatibilities. There are different standards for sex, language, race, religion, politics and personal computers. With its new program Soft Windows 95 for Power Macintosh, Insignia Solutions Inc. has done little to resolve the battle of the sexes or the 1996 election, but it has succeeded fairly well in forging a closer relationship between the Macintosh and Windows cultures. Soft Windows 95, with an estimated retail price of $350, effectively converts a fast Macintosh into a slow 486-based PC that is capable of using Windows software.
4/7/1996	Less Cash, Large Losses: Apple's Dwindling Dollars	"WILL Apple Computer run out of cash soon? David Dreman, the chairman of Dreman Value Advisors in Jersey City, thinks so. """"The company can't continue on as it has for another 60 or 90 days,"""" he said. """"The cash drain will cause a crisis. Or force an enormous scaling back or the sale of the company."""" Many are more optimistic than Mr. Dreman. But while much of the talk about Apple these days focuses on how it could restore consumer confidence and reacquire its former glory, the nation's No. 3 computer maker may be facing a more mundane and immediate problem: an empty wallet."
4/5/1996	Apple Agrees to Sell a Big Macintosh Plant	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had agreed to sell its manufacturing plant in Fountain, Colo., to SCI Systems Inc. for an undisclosed amount. SCI, a major contract electronic manufacturer based in Huntsville, Ala., will produce Apple products at the plant. The Fountain plant was one of two large Apple manufacturing sites in the United States, along with a factory near Sacramento.
4/2/1996	Apple Chief Is Seen Retreating From Price Cuts	Apple Computer Inc. may be preparing to extract itself from the computer industry price wars. Apple's new chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, is planning to return the embattled computer maker to a strategy of setting itself apart from the rest of the personal computer industry by trying to develop machines so reliable and sought after that customers willingly pay premium prices, according to employees who have attended meetings with him. For the last three years, Apple had adopted a strategy of competing directly in price with makers of personal computers based on Intel chips and Microsoft operating systems, which dominate the market.
3/28/1996	Apple Expects It Will Lose $700 Million	Apple Computer said today that it expected to report a $700 million after-tax loss for its fiscal second quarter, a sign that the nation's third-largest personal computer maker is in even deeper financial trouble than had previously been recognized. The company said that more than half of the loss it was projecting for the quarter, which ends March 31, would come from write-downs against more than $1 billion in unsold products. An additional 25 percent would be related to restructuring costs, the company said, indicating that another wave of layoffs is imminent.
3/26/1996	The Latest Macintosh Operating System Revisions: Comet or Candle?	WAS it just a decade ago that we waited for the glorious arrival of Halley's Comet, only to see a little fuzzball smudging the night sky? Despite the disappointment of that event 10 years ago, some of us still venture out in the wee hours to catch a glimpse of potential greatness. So, on a dark night last week, we went looking for two new transients, one Comet Hyakutake, or 1996 B2, whizzing through space to make its closest approach to Earth, and the other Apple Computer's new Macintosh System 7.5.3 operating system software.
3/14/1996	Is Pippin a Breakthrough or Outmoded on Arrival?	It seems a potent combination: Apple Computer Inc. and Bandai Company Ltd. developing a simplified home computer to combine the American company's innovative Macintosh technology with the Japanese toy maker's knack for fun. The Power PC meets the Power Rangers. But as the Pippin Atmark goes on sale this month in Japan, questions are being raised about whether the machine really combines the best of the computer and toy worlds or is merely an unacceptable compromise -- underequipped as a computer yet, at about $620, overpriced as a video-game machine.
3/13/1996	Seeking to Fix Damaged Image, Apple Hires Burson-Marsteller	Apple Computer Inc., still recovering from its public relations debacle during merger talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. and the ouster of its chief executive, said today that it had retained Burson-Marsteller to manage its worldwide public relations. During years of affiliation with Regis McKenna Inc., the seminal Silicon Valley public relations firm, Apple had made little use of outside agencies. But Regis has switched its focus to marketing consulting and last month, Apple announced that its two top public relations executives, Barbara Krause and Betty Taylor, were leaving. Now the company has turned to Burson, a unit of Young & Rubicam Inc., Satjiv Chahil, Apple's senior vice president of corporate marketing, said in a telephone interview.
3/12/1996	As eWorld Sinks, Which Lifeboat?	APPLE COMPUTER INC.'s on-line information service, eWorld, is eVaporating, and by the end of the month will be eXtinct. Apple says it will shut down eWorld on March 31 and refocus its attention on the Internet's World Wide Web. Even so, Apple does not want to be known as the company that created 147,000 homeless people in cyberspace. It is encouraging eWorld refugees to migrate to America Online; AOL software will be bundled with most new Macintosh computers, and AOL will develop new software and services especially for Mac users.
3/2/1996	Apple to Close Its On-Line Unit	Apple Computer Inc. has decided to discontinue its once-heralded on-line service, eWorld, on March 31. The move was announced yesterday in a memorandum to publishers on the service. Apple had said late last year that it planned to increase its presence on the Internet's World Wide Web but had not yet decided whether or how to mesh its on-line service into that effort.
2/20/1996	Apple Computer Makes Motorola Licensing Deal	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would license its Macintosh operating system to Motorola Inc. and for the first time Apple said that it would allow Motorola to sell its own sublicenses to the popular software program. While the announcement was expected, industry analysts said the licensing arrangement points to a new Apple strategy of confronting the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation in parts of the world where the personal computer market is not yet well developed. However, the new agreement still fell short of providing Apple with a licensing partner among the top PC makers in the United States.
2/19/1996	Innovation, Hence Survival, at Apple	If Apple Computer's new chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, has a grand vision for remaking the personal computer company as it approaches its third decade, he has not yet disclosed it. Meeting with journalists on Friday for the first time as the company's chief, Mr. Amelio offered a clear and concise message: Apple's problems are not life-threatening and can be corrected without slashing the work force or merging with another company.
2/18/1996	FROM THE DESK OF: LLOYD M. KRIEGER;Hey, Mac, Don't Fail Me Now!	MEMBERS of my computer-savvy generation can be divided into two groups: PC people and Macintosh people. The difference goes beyond what sits on our desks or what we carry in our briefcases. It reflects our attitude about our work and  ourselves. I have always been a Macintosh person. I got hooked while in college at Stanford, a stone's throw from Silicon Valley. I bought my first Mac when I was  a sophomore in 1986. I used it to write term papers and to make presentations and run statistics for my biology class. It was a modular design, without wires  and a separate monitor. In that pre-laptop era, on a warm day, I would take it outside and work in the sun.
2/18/1996	A $40 Million Conceit	WHEN California's new money collides with old money, the results can be, well, unsettling. Set in the hills west of Stanford University, Woodside has a population of 5,000 and a tradition of wealth. Members of the Bay Area's power elite have traditionally kept horses on sprawling estates here, and strict zoning ordinances maintain a woodsy, rural feel.
2/17/1996	New Chief Outlines Strategy to Revive Apple Computer	The new chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., Gilbert F. Amelio, said today that the personal computer maker could straighten out its business strategy quickly and that the company could make needed changes without huge layoffs as has been widely expected. He also reiterated that the company was not in merger talks.
2/14/1996	Pay for New Apple Chief Seen Topping $10 Million	However shaky the future of Apple Computer Inc. may be, Gilbert F. Amelio, the company's new chairman and chief executive, is sure to be financially secure. Mr. Amelio's pay package, according to one expert on executive compensation, will total at least $10 million a year for the next five years, and could go much higher if Apple's stock price improves. In addition, Mr. Amelio is guaranteed a payment of $10 million if the company is sold within a year -- a possibility, given Apple's recent merger talk with Sun Microsystems Inc.
2/13/1996	Apple Suspends Quarterly Dividend for First Time	"Apple Computer Inc. has for the first time suspended payment of its quarterly dividend, the company said in a filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Apple did not declare a dividend for its first fiscal quarter, which ended Dec. 29, and does not expect to declare one """"in the near future,"""" according to the filing."
2/11/1996	Computer Lesson	"A mere 12 years ago, Apple Computer brought forth the Mac and changed history. But Apple, reeling from unprecedented losses, has been struggling to stay independent. At the very best, it must make itself over, probably through downsizing, which threatens to leave its Mac Revolution sadly incomplete. When Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak set up Apple Computer in 1976, computing was an esoteric technical specialty. As a marketing concept, home computers seemed about as promising as thermonuclear toothbrushes. But the Apple II of 1977 was a hit. I.B.M., it's fair to guess, was puzzled at first (""""what do you do with it?"""") but then realized that here was the perfect solution for propping open the machine-room door."
2/9/1996	Apple Vows To Remain Independent	"Apple Computer Inc. said today that it intended to remain an independent company under its new chairman, and it blamed recent """"speculation"""" about a potential merger for making the company's dire financial outlook even bleaker. The company said that customer uncertainty would contribute to a financial loss for the current quarter that would """"significantly exceed"""" the $69 million loss it reported for the fiscal quarter that ended in December."
2/7/1996	Apple Computer Talks With Sun	Despite widespread public speculation that Apple Computer Inc. had broken off merger talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. last week, executives from the two companies met secretly at a Palo Alto, Calif., law firm over the weekend, people familiar with the discussions said today. It could not be determined whether the meetings indicated that the companies were considering a merger, or other types of strategic alliances.
2/6/1996	Apple Computer Cuts Prices on Its Performa Line	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had reduced the prices of its Performa line of consumer-oriented Macintosh's as much as 12 percent, and broadened a rebate program on printers and monitors. Separately, Apple said it was developing a version of Linux, a popular form of the Unix operating system, to run on the Macintosh. The company said Linux would allow scientists, students and other Unix users to run both the Macintosh operating system and Unix on a single machine. Apple said it expected the software to be available this summer and that the company would post updates on the World Wide Web at: http://www.mklinux.apple.com.
2/5/1996	Apple Computer Over Time	"Almost from the time it was founded in 1976 in a garage by Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, Apple Computer has enjoyed a special place in American business, sort of the corporate equivalent of the Grateful Dead. Its customers were fanatically loyal and could hardly walk by another manufacturer's personal computer without making contemptuous remarks. Every article in a computer magazine about hardware-software compatability or lack of standards for peripherals would prompt letters that said, in effect, """"Not on my Macintosh."""" Apple still hopes to avoid the fate of Sony Corporation's Betamax technology for video cassette recorders, which was a superior product to VHS rivals, and lost out."
2/4/1996	Changing Guard at Apple: The Board Says 'Enough'	"On a late afternoon last fall the chief executive of Apple Computer Inc. stood dejectedly in the office of a longtime friend at 3000 Sand Hill Road, a venture-capital enclave in Silicon Valley's nerve center, and complained that at age 52 he was a burned-out man. Beset with a heart condition and his wife ill with cancer, Michael H. Spindler said he was fed up. He had taken the reins of Apple after the company ousted the former chairman and chief, John Sculley, in 1993. First as an Apple sales executive in Europe, then as chief operating officer in the United States and now as the man whose job it was to salvage a company that symbolized American high-tech, the German executive had been worn down by 18-hour days that had earned him the nickname """"Diesel."
2/3/1996	Apple and Disclosure: How Golden Is Silence?	American investors expect to be told, promptly and publicly, all the important information they need to gauge the value of a company's stock. But for weeks, Apple Computer Inc.'s investors have been trading in the dark. There had been, of course, conflicting reports over the status and terms of a rumored merger with Sun Microsystems Inc., which day after day neither company confirmed nor denied. The murkiness reached inky proportions yesterday morning, when buyers and sellers of Apple's shares literally did not know who was running the company.
2/3/1996	A Corporate Doctor Gets Mixed Reviews	"Having rescued National Semiconductor Inc. from near bankruptcy, Gilbert F. Amelio is known as a turnaround artist, though he shuns the term. A turnaround artist """"follows a ruthless formula,"""" Mr. Amelio said in a recent book. By contrast, a transformation expert, as he likes to be called, """"looks for long-term solutions"""" that allow the company """"to become strong and thrive for years."
2/3/1996	Shake-Up at Apple Computer Places Director in Chief's Job	Financially troubled Apple Computer said last night that Michael H. Spindler had been dismissed as president and chief executive. He is being replaced by Gilbert F. Amelio, already an Apple board member, who will become chairman and chief executive of the struggling personal computer maker. Stepping down to the post of vice chairman is an Apple founder and its longtime chairman, Armas C. (Mike) Markkula Jr.
2/2/1996	Apple-Sun Deal Is Reported to Be Near Collapse Again	Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems on Thursday once again came close to merging, but the talks may now collapse in wake of reports today that Apple's chief executive, Michael Spindler, will be replaced with National Semiconductor Corporation's head, Gilbert F. Amelio. The two companies have been discussing a merger for more than a month. Following an all-day meeting of Apple's board on Wednesday, the computer maker was said today to be on the verge of accepting an offer that was several dollars higher than Sun's first bid of $23 a share. News of the initial offer, which Sun made on Jan. 23, sent Apple's stock downward.
1/31/1996	With No Deal on Horizon, Apple Shares Are Slipping	Shares of Apple Computer Inc. continued to slide today, hitting another 52-week low on concerns that no deal is imminent for the struggling company. Apple shares fell $1.813 to close at $27.313 in heavy Nasdaq trading. Analysts said the shares had been buoyed by the widespread assumption that Apple would be acquired, and the stock was now seeking its natural level.
1/30/1996	Apple Freezes Most Spending For Research	Uncertainty about Apple Computer Inc.'s future continued to gnaw at the company today, as Apple froze most research spending, while Standard & Poor's downgraded Apple's debt rating and a selloff pushed the company's shares to a 52-week closing low. An internal memo announcing the research freeze said that Apple's management was preparing a reorganization plan that would be presented to the board within two weeks.
1/30/1996	U.S. PC Makers Don't Gain Any Market Share in Japan	Makers of American personal computers stopped gaining market share in Japan last year, having brought about ferocious price competition by their Japanese competitors, a market research firm reported today. The NEC Corporation of Japan kept its No. 1 position, and vaulting to second place was Fujitsu Ltd., which more than tripled its shipments of personal computers in 1995 to 1.05 million, and doubled its market share, to 18.3 percent, the market research firm Dataquest Japan said.
1/30/1996	A Clash of Titanic Web Browsers	FOR many people, Netscape is synonymous with the Internet. The Netscape Communications Corporation, whose corporate symbol is a fire-breathing monster nicknamed Mozilla, makes the Netscape Navigator software used by millions of people to operate and browse the Internet's popular World Wide Web. But fans of Japanese science fiction films will recall that Mozilla's role model, Godzilla, had some tough fights. Sure enough, a titanic struggle looms between Mozilla and its genetically altered twin: Microsoftra, better known as Microsoft Internet Explorer.
1/29/1996	The Man Who Would Buy Apple;But Sun's Chief, Scott McNealy, Probably Won't Be Caught Overpaying	At the headquarters of Sun Microsystems Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., there is no corporate art on the walls. There are no company limousines or reserved parking places. No one is allowed to personalize the stationery, by having a name embossed on the company letterhead. Those frills cost money. When Scott G. McNealy, the boyish-looking, 41-year-old chairman, decides to have a serious talk over lunch with one of Sun's executives, he splurges by going to Chevys, a nearby Mexican restaurant. The bill typically weighs in at about $10 -- for two.
1/29/1996	Along with talk about a merger with Sun are reports that Apple is pondering new  agency ties.	THE tumult surrounding Apple Computer Inc. is extending to the company's agency relationships. Apple executives discussing whether to sell the company to Sun Microsystems Inc. are also focusing on Apple's advertising. According to agency executives who spoke late last week on the condition of anonymity, the Apple executives have begun talking to several shops about working for Apple in some capacity.
1/27/1996	No Sign of Shift in Talks on Apple-Sun Merger	If anyone thinks a deal is imminent between Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems, Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun, is apparently not among them. He is planning to spend Saturday and Sunday in Monterey, Calif., playing in the AT&T Pro-Am golf tournament. Rumors continued to fly yesterday that a merger of Apple and Sun would happen, including a report by Bloomberg Business News that the companies would announce a deal after the stock market closed. They did not.
1/26/1996	Future in Doubt, Apple Still Fills A Crucial Post	Indicating that business goes on even as its fate as an independent company hangs in the balance, Apple Computer Inc. today filled a high-level executive post that had been open for nearly a year. The company named Heidi Roizen, the co-founder and former chief executive of a software producer called T-Maker, to be vice president in charge of its relations with independent software developers.
1/25/1996	Apple invented most of its technology. Now it must reinvent its strategy.	THE world has been watching while Apple Computer Inc. has apparently been having a very public nervous breakdown. Its anemic financial performance and only vague and mostly defensive explanations on how it intends to fix its longstanding problems reportedly has the company considering selling itself at a fire-sale price.
1/25/1996	Sun's Bid for Apple Computer Placed Below Stock's Price	Sun Microsystems wants to merge with Apple Computer, but it thinks Apple is worth far less than its current market price. Sun offered only about $2.76 billion, or $23 a share, for Apple, according to several people familiar with the negotiations at both companies, far lower than the $4 billion indicated in published reports this week.
1/25/1996	What Is an Apple Worth?;Ailing Innovator's Luster as an Acquisition Dims	The board of Apple Computer Inc. met for a second consecutive day yesterday to try to devise a rescue plan for the fabled Silicon Valley company, which is leaking money, market share, talent and industry support at an alarming rate. Despite persistent reports of an impending deal in which Sun Microsystems Inc. would acquire Apple, some executives familiar with recent talks between the two companies said that the two sides remained far apart on the question of price; at least one person said the talks broke off yesterday. With neither company willing to comment, the situation remained unclear.
1/25/1996	Apple's Woes May Benefit Consumers	This may be a difficult time to be an Apple Computer shareholder, but that does not make it a bad time to buy an Apple Macintosh computer, computer industry analysts say. Despite the confusion surrounding Apple's weak financial performance and corporate revamping, including reports that the company may soon be acquired by Sun Microsystems Inc., analysts insist that there is little risk in buying a Macintosh.
1/24/1996	Apple Takeover Rumors Fuel Feverish Trading	"Shares of Apple Computer Inc. fell in after-hours trading today, after the company's chairman attempted to contain continuing rumors of an impending takeover by flatly stating, """"Apple is not for sale."""" In today's regular trading session, Apple shares rose on heavy volume, while Sun Microsystems Inc.'s stock fell, after a published report quoted an unidentified person as saying that a deal between the two companies was """"imminent."
1/23/1996	Works Within Works	WHEN you start Clarisworks 4.0, the new version written to take full advantage of Windows 95, the screen presents a list of its six modules: word processing, drawing, painting, spreadsheet, database and communications. You select one to start with.
1/21/1996	Apple's Alter-Ego	Poor Apple. Its computers are elegant, its customers devoted and, many experts insist, its technology is the best. Yet last week Apple Computer Inc. reported a $69 million loss in the Christmas quarter and said it plans to lay off 1,300 workers. The problem? Apple has failed in the basics of business. Elsewhere, the Microsoft Corporation has proved the power of marketing. In the early 1980's Microsoft's operating system, Windows, was a clunky imitation of Apple's. But Microsoft kept improving Windows and its marketing strategies, capping its efforts with the release last August of Windows 95, which has sold like no other product in computer history. The company reported last week that its quarterly profits jumped more than 50 percent. STEVE LOHR
1/19/1996	Market Place;For contrarians and risk takers, Apple's woes may be good news.	IT is not an investment strategy for the weak of heart, but buying Apple Computer Inc. at its lows has historically been one way to make nice returns. So, are there any buyers? Apple's shares fell to a 52-week low yesterday, dropping $2.0625, to $31.9375, after the company reported on Wednesday that it had a loss of $69 million in its first fiscal quarter, and that it would lay off 1,300 employees as part of a restructuring plan.
1/18/1996	Apple Plans 1,300 Layoffs And Takes Loss	Apple Computer Inc., reporting a loss for its first fiscal quarter, said today that it would lay off about 1,300 employees as part of a restructuring. But Apple gave computer industry analysts and investors little indication of how it would alter its business to regain profitability. Indeed, the company now expects a second-quarter operating loss.
1/11/1996	Apple Raises Loss Estimate, In a Surprise To Wall Street	Apple Computer Inc., which warned last month that it might report a loss for the quarter, put a number next to that prognosis today, and it was twice as bad as most analysts had expected. The company said it now expected to report next week a loss of about $68 million for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 29. The news came after the stock market closed, but in after-hours trading shares of Apple -- which had ended regular Nasdaq trading up $1.50 at $34.25 -- plunged to the $31 range.
12/19/1995	Apple Warned On Debt Rating	Two leading debt-rating agencies warned yesterday that they might lower their ratings on the debt securities of Apple Computer because of worries about the company's earnings and revenue. Last week, Apple said that its profit margins were slipping and that sales had not met projections, leading it to anticipate a loss for the quarter ending on Dec. 31.
12/18/1995	Doonesbury' and Apple Hatch a Comic Surprise	"Egg freckles?"""" No. it doesn't make much sense. Which is why the cartoonist Garry Trudeau coined this apt (or inept) bit of idiocy to lampoon the original hand-held Newton computer's difficulty in deciphering handwriting."
12/16/1995	Apple Expects To Post Loss This Quarter	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it expected to show a loss for its current quarter, usually its strongest period of the year, and the company hinted that substantial layoffs might be imminent. The announcement deepens the atmosphere of crisis that has hovered over Apple all year. Apple's stock plunged 8 percent on the news, losing $3, to $34.25, which is close to its 52-week low in Nasdaq trading.
12/12/1995	Canopener Adds New Gadgets	Abbott Systems started with Canopener, a Macintosh utility that looks into files, even damaged ones, that the Mac cannot otherwise open and allows text and graphics to be copied. Canopener is still around, now in version 3.0; it costs $59. Abbott's team of programmers, both of them, have since added seven other little programs to the mix. You can waste a lot of time with the first one, Kaleidoscope, which is high praise. It paints an image of the Mandelbrot set (you know, those entrancing chaotically repeating things) on the screen, and lets you zoom in and out, isolating details that resemble the whole thing, altering colors and speed and type of motion, saving images, moving them into other programs or printing them or sending them out on the network. The images can be transformed into pseudo-screensavers, though the brief instructions forgot to tell how to turn it off. (Command-period, of course.) A Powermac, or a Macintosh with a math co-processor (F.P.U.) is required, and the program can work with 24-bit color. The version tried here was 1.0; 2.0 is better for Powermacs. Kaleidoscope is $29.
12/2/1995	Apple Prices Cut for Holidays	Apple Computer Inc. cut its recommended prices for six desktop computers by an average of 15 percent today, aiming for more sales during the busiest shopping season of the year. The cuts ranged from 8 percent to 25 percent, with the deepest cuts on the oldest models. Two Power Macintosh 7200 models, which have been on sale just since August, were cut 8 percent to 11 percent.
11/30/1995	Apple Computer Co-Founder Strikes Gold With New Stock	"In the world of high technology, which keeps score in part by tracking the ups and downs of the stock market, Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer, re-emerged today as a captain of industry. Mr. Jobs's company, Pixar Animation Studios, the maker of the blockbuster movie """"Toy Story,"""" offered its stock to the public today, and by the end of trading the shares had almost doubled in price. As such, his Pixar stake of 80.2 percent was worth more than $1 billion on paper -- more than the value of his Apple stock at any time during the eight years he ran that company."
11/18/1995	Apple and I.B.M. End Multimedia Joint Venture	Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M. said today that they were closing one of their three joint ventures, Kaleida Labs Inc., which makes programming tools for multimedia software. Kaleida had never managed to dislodge the industry standard, Macromedia Inc.'s Director program, from its perch. Kaleida had only 79 employees, some of whom will be offered positions at Apple and I.B.M., the companies said.
11/16/1995	UMAX DATA OF TAIWAN IN APPLE CLONE DEAL	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would permit UMAX Data Systems, a maker of computer equipment that is based in Taiwan, to make clones of Apple's Macintosh computers in Asia and later in the United States. The deal, announced at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas, Nev., is the second major licensing agreement reached by Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif. Earlier this year the company signed licensing agreements with two small companies based in Silicon Valley, the Power Computing Corporation and Radius Inc. Apple, I.B.M. and Motorola Inc. also announced a common hardware standard that will enable a computer to use a variety of operating systems, including the Macintosh OS, Microsoft NT and I.B.M. OS/2. Volume shipments of computers with the new standard, known as the common hardware reference platform, are not expected for another year.
11/13/1995	Apple Gives Messagepad a Tuneup	"New software for Apple Computer's Newton Messagepad is winning positive early reviews. But just when Apple's long-ridiculed hand-held computer is finally earning some respect, there are reports around Silicon Valley that the computer maker is thinking about deserting the project. """"Michael Spindler is absolutely adamant about not continuing to pour money into Newton,"""" Andrew Gore, an executive editor at Macweek, an industry weekly, said, referring to Apple's chief executive. """"On the other hand, it's hard to kill a product that got as much bad publicity as this one, just when it starts to look good."
11/13/1995	Apple Led Domestic PC Sales In 3d Quarter, 2 Surveys Find	Apple Computer Inc. was the nation's largest maker of personal computers in the third quarter, according to surveys to be released on Monday by two leading market-research companies, Dataquest and the International Data Corporation. Apple had led the industry in the 1980's and early 1990's. Since then, its market share has significantly declined.
11/7/1995	ADOBE VENTURES TO FOCUS ON IMAGING SOFTWARE	Adobe Systems Inc. announced yesterday that it had formed alliances with Apple Computer Inc., the Eastman Kodak Company and Metatools Inc. to simplify digital-imaging technology. Adobe also introduced Adobe Photodeluxe, software that lets personal computer users retouch photographs. The company said the alliances and its software, would allow easy access to technology for image input, editing and enhancement. Adobe and Apple are working to integrate the Apple Quicktake 150 digital camera with the Windows and Macintosh versions of the Photodeluxe software. Adobe and Kodak are trying to simplify the process of accessing digital photos from a computer. And Adobe and Metatools are working on a variety of special-effects tools in Adobe PhotoDeluxe.
11/7/1995	Apple Clone, by Any Other Name	"THE Power Computing Corporation refuses to call its computers """"clones,"""" and Apple Computer Inc. refuses to allow them to be called """"Macintoshes."""" But everyone else is going to call the Power Wave 604 a Macintosh clone, and a very impressive one at that. In the last year the Power Computing Corporation has created a line of highly regarded computers that use the same Power PC microprocessor and Mac OS operating system that Apple uses. With the newest line, the Power Wave 604's, Power Computing has actually stepped ahead of Apple in introducing new technology."
11/3/1995	An Apple Computer Executive Resigns, the 4th in a Year	Daniel L. Eilers, Apple Computer Inc.'s head of worldwide marketing, abruptly resigned today, the fourth senior executive to leave the company in the last year.
11/1/1995	Defying Skeptics, Apple Raises Its Market Share	Defying predictions of its impending demise, Apple Computer Inc. regained worldwide personal computer market share in the third quarter and reclaimed second place behind Compaq Computer, according to figures released today by Dataquest, the market research firm. Despite widely publicized problems with its supply of parts for its desktop computers and an embarrassing battery fire that stalled the introduction of a new portable, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., raised its market share of worldwide computer shipments to 9 percent from 7.4 percent for the previous quarter. Compaq had 10 percent of the personal computer market, shipping 1.485 million machines, a gain of 21.6 percent over the 1994 period.
10/30/1995	Powerwave to Make Debut	The Power Computing Corporation, the first company to license Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh operating system, said it planned to introduce its newest line of Macintosh clones on Monday. The new Powerwave computers, which feature the fastest Power PC processors, cost between $3,199 and $4,499. The new 604 Power PC processors are manufactured by the International Business Machines Corporation and Motorola Inc. Power Computing, which is based in Austin, is planning to ship 100,000 units by May 1996, Stephen Khang, the founder of the company, said.
10/23/1995	Behind the Scenes;A Short Cut Into Virtual Reality	"While Michael Douglas thumbed through his employer's secret files with ease in """"Disclosure"""" using a virtual reality program, the actual applications of that technology are are more suited to the fields of architecture, electronic games and business presentations. But everyday users cannot create virual reality scenes easily. Conventional virtual reality applications require huge amounts of computing power to generate realistic scenes. Trying to generate scenes in real time on a computer is akin to trying to stuff an elephant into a hall closet. A scaled-down alternative is Apple's Quicktime VR, a technology for creating and displaying scenes made from photographs, video stills or computer renderings. Programmers are just beginning to use the technology for games and architectural applications."
10/19/1995	Apple's Income For Quarter Falls 47.6%	Capping a strenuous year of slipping market share and an inability to meet demand for its most popular products, Apple Computer Inc. reported yesterday that its earnings fell 47.6 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter. The results were below Wall Street's expectations for a quarter that Apple's chief executive, Michael H. Spindler, had called the company's most difficult.
10/16/1995	Apple Rejects Request to Put Operating System on I.B.M.'s	Apple Computer Inc. has rejected a request by a small Swiss company to license its version of the Macintosh operating system for use on computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation. Apple officials confirmed the decision after learning that MacWorld magazine would report the news in its issue on Monday.
10/10/1995	ORACLE SAYS IT IS DESIGNING LOW-COST COMPUTER	The Oracle Corporation said yesterday it was designing a $500 computer using chips from an Apple Computer Inc. venture. Oracle's chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison, told shareholders that the new machine would be much simpler than personal computers costing three times as much and would provide functions like electronic mail, word processing and Internet access. The Oracle computer uses the ARM chip, from Advanced RISC Machines Group, in which Apple holds a controlling stake. Mr. Ellison declined to say who would build the machines.
10/6/1995	Apple and I.B.M. as One: Can It Happen?	A decade ago, I.B.M. and Apple Computer were bitter enemies engaged in an epic battle to dominate the personal computer industry. Now, many in the computer industry and on Wall Street -- including Apple's departing chief financial officer -- believe that the only hope for Apple is to sell itself to I.B.M., or some other savior. Talk of an Apple-I.B.M. combination, around for years, has returned as Apple struggles to overcome manufacturing and management mishaps that have seen it pass up millions of dollars in sales even as the personal computer market booms. On Wednesday, Joseph A. Graziano, Apple's respected chief financial officer, said he would be leaving the company after Apple's board rejected his argument that the company could no longer thrive as an independent enterprise.
10/6/1995	Bruised, but Buoyant;The Chief of Apple Computer Says the Worst Is Over	"Give us one strong quarter and all this will go away."""" That was the response today from Michael H. Spindler, chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., a day after his top lieutenant resigned and the board gave Mr. Spindler what was widely perceived as merely a pro forma vote of confidence."
10/5/1995	Apple Official Steps Down In Board Feud	"The executive vice president and chief financial officer of Apple Computer Inc. abruptly resigned his positions today, the apparent loser in a board room skirmish with the chief executive of the troubled computer maker. Although Apple officially said that the parting of Joseph A. Graziano was """"amicable,"""" citing only a difference of opinion between him and Michael H. Spindler, people close to the situation said Mr. Graziano had attempted to persuade board members that the company should be sold, possibly to the International Business Machines Corporation. But the board closed ranks behind Mr. Spindler, who argued that Apple should remain independent, and Mr. Graziano chose to quit."
10/4/1995	A New Computer Dazzles a Jaded Industry Crowd	It may prove a quixotic journey in a computer industry increasingly dominated by the mighty Microsoft and the giant Intel. But the sheer dazzle of a new personal computer demonstrated today by Jean-Louis Gassee, the former engineering head of Apple Computer Inc., drew a standing ovation from a normally skeptical crowd of 500 of some of the most discerning executives in technology, who are here for an annual conference called Agenda.
9/23/1995	APPLE COMPUTER RESUMES SALES OF POWERBOOK	The Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it had once again begun shipping its Powerbook 5300 portable computer, but this time with a nickel metal hydride battery, replacing the lithium ion battery that led to a product recall on Sept. 14. The machines, announced in August, had just begun shipping when Apple said it had halted deliveries because several computers being used by Apple employees had caught fire when a battery malfuntioned. The computer maker said that it was still investigating the nature of the lithium ion battery problem and that it would not make these batteries, which offer longer life, available until it was certain it had identified the problem. The computer maker said it was reducing the cost of its computers by about $100 across the product line, which ranges from $2,099 to $6,399. It said the machines would begin showing up on dealers' shelves immediately.
9/18/1995	Apple's Newton Poised for a Rebirth	The Newton, Apple's hand-held computer, is on the brink of a second life, and industry analysts who have seen prototypes say the new version comes significantly closer to meeting its original promise than the first model, which was widely derided as John Sculley's folly. At a closed meeting for about 400 software developers in San Francisco early this month, Apple Computer Inc. introduced new Newton software. People close to the company said the new operating system, called the Newton OS 2.0, will go on sale in November.
9/16/1995	Computer Fires Set Apple Back At Crucial Time	For months, Apple Computer Inc. had been contending that once consumers looked at Microsoft's new Windows 95 software, the comparison would help Apple's own business catch fire. Now, in a sense, its prophecy has come true, and the company is less than delighted. Some of Apple's newest portable machines have burst into flames, and the company is recalling them.
9/11/1995	Apple Holds School Market, Despite Decline	At a time when Apple Computer Inc. is facing sharp attacks on many fronts, the maverick company is maintaining a secure foothold in one crucial arena: the $4 billion market for computer equipment and software in public schools. In an annual survey of public schools being released this month to coincide with the start of the school year, Apple's share of computer sales to elementary and high schools was expected to climb from 46 percent of all educational computers bought last year to 58 percent of the total being bought in the 1995-96 school year.
9/5/1995	Sizing Up the Latest Powerbooks	"APPLE has finally put some """"power"""" in its Powerbook portable computers. But somewhere along the way, they lost some of their pizzazz. Several new models of the Powerbook family were introduced last week, all but one of them built around the Power PC microprocessor upon which Apple is basing (and betting) its future. The new 5300-series and 2300-series Power PC-based Powerbooks appear to be solid upgrades of the Powerbook and Duo line, and bargain hunters will definitely want to look at the Powerbook 190."
8/28/1995	Apple to Announce More Powerbooks	Apple Computer plans to announce a new generation of its Powerbook portable computers Monday, lowering prices and for the first time offering models that include its faster Power PC microprocessor. The new line, ranging in price from $1,679 to $6,799, will place Apple back in the lead in portable computer performance, analysts said.
8/22/1995	Intriguing Promises From Apple	WINDOWS 95, the system software upgrade that will finally be released this week by the Microsoft Corporation, has a number of keen and spiffy new features that will delight anyone who has never used an Apple Macintosh. Once they install Windows 95 and spend hundreds of dollars replacing their existing applications with Windows-95-compliant versions, Microsoft's customers will be able to use long file names; organize files in nested folders; use a mouse to drag files from one window on screen to another; add new peripherals without needing an electrical engineering degree, and so on.
8/9/1995	Windows 95 Shows Apple's Miscalculation	"To the Editor: """"Business Often Goes to the Swift, Not the Best"""" (Week in Review, Aug. 6), on the dominance of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system software over Apple misses essential aspects of the competition. The theory that aggressive and swift software marketing yielded long-term market control would be better applied to how Windows beat out the OS-2 operating system than to its competition with Apple."
8/7/1995	Macworld Fills the Pre-Windows Quietude	Apple Computer Inc., taking advantage of the lull before Hurricane Windows strikes the computer industry with full force later this month, plans to introduce three new models in its desktop Power Macintosh product line today. Apple will also announce a new software package that the company said would make it easy for Macintosh users to connect their machines to the Internet.
8/6/1995	Ideas & Trends; Business Often Goes to the Swift, Not the Best	"IT was Emerson, by most accounts, who said: Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door. And for a nation of optimists, inventors and entrepreneurs, the maxim embraces an American ideal -- smarts and hard work will be rewarded. Woolly-headed nonsense, according to some leading economists. """"It's naive to believe that efficient engineering solutions win in the marketplace,"""" declares Paul A. David, a professor at Stanford University and a senior research fellow at Oxford University's All Souls College. """"That view is not supported by the study of history."
7/31/1995	Bracing for a Microsoft Onslaught, Apple Sees No Reason to Panic	In Silicon Valley it is fashionable to predict that the imminent arrival of Windows 95 spells the ultimate demise of Apple Computer Inc. A growing chorus of pundits and Wall Street analysts has zeroed in on Apple and its home-grown operating system as the biggest potential losers in the wake of the introduction, due in late August, of the Microsoft Corporation's updated computer operating system. Apple popularized the personal computer in the late 1970's and made computing much simpler with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. But its lead in simplicity will be narrowed by Windows 95.
7/31/1995	How the Software and the Network Stack Up	"SOFTWARE: THE DESKTOP Many of the technological improvements in Windows 95 mimick characteristics long available in Apple Computer's Macintosh operating system and I.B.M.'s OS/2 -- particularly the use of visual icons and task bars to make it faster and easier to operate the computer. All three operating systems now offer """"plug and play,"""" meaning that peripheral devices like printers and CD-ROM drives can be added with no need for the user to reconfigure the software. With Windows 95, users can do this only with software programs created specifically for it. Windows 95: The start button summons the initial menu of options. A sub-menu lets the user launch programs directly, instead of searching through several sub-directories, as the old Windows required. Users can add frequently needed applications to the task bar that always appears on the screen. Macintosh: There are several ways to start programs and organize files on the Macintosh. One way is the Apple menu. Another way is the launch pad, which made its debut last year in System 7.5. It is a round-up of icons for the user's most frequently accessed applications. OS/2: OS/2 also features a launch pad. The software also integrates so-called drag-and-drop mouse commands, which make it easy to fax or print a document, simply by dragging the document icon to the printer or fax icon. FILE MANAGEMENT With the Windows update, individual files are now handled much the same way in all three operating systems. The differences lie in efficiency. OS/2 offers true """"multi-tasking,"""" which means that the computer can perform several tasks simultaneously. Windows 95 offers true multi-tasking only when all of the programs in use are ones designed specifically for the new Windows. Otherwise, tasks like sending a fax can slow down other operations. Windows 95: The user can organize the files into folders and sub-folders of his or her choosing, displayed in a tree-and-branch format. Individual files created in the same program are all represented by the same icon, for easier visual identification. Macintosh: Windows 95's file-management approach is similar to the Macintosh's. Macintosh's visual desktop setup uses icons to represent the hard drive and other components, as well as a trash can for deleting files. OS/2: Files are organized in folders as icons, as shown above, or using the tree-and-branch motif. INTERNET ACCESS Unless the Justice Department intervenes, Microsoft plans to offer direct access to its new Microsoft Network and to the Internet through Windows 95. Apple offers Internet access through its own eWorld service. OS/2 offers Internet access through I.B.M.'s network. Windows 95: This is the Microsoft Network's E-mail screen. While most users choose services based on their content, they actually use plain-Jane tools such as E-mail most frequently. OS/2: The OS/2 interface allows for full use of the Internet, including the World Wide Web. A user dials into I.B.M.'s systema and the comptuer is automatically configured to use E-mail, the Web and other tools. THE NETWORKS: A COMPARISON On Aug. 24, the same day it begins selling Windows 95, Microsoft also plans to enter the on-line business with the Microsoft Network, known as MSN. Tables show how it will compare with the current leaders. MICROSOFT NETWORK LAYOUT Designed to be fully integrated with Windows 95, the Microsoft Network uses a visual navigation system very similar to that of the operating system.

On-line support for Windows 95 and other Microsoft programs is available through the Categories area."
7/25/1995	Electronic Pen With Its Own Eraser	"AS a drawing or painting tool, the computer mouse is only slightly less effective than a potato. This is particularly a problem for artists who want to use the power of the personal computer to create new forms of electronic art, but it also makes life difficult for people who want to draw maps, make sketches or simply doodle with a computer painting program. The Wacom Technology Corporation recently introduced a new graphics tablet for Apple Macintosh computers that uses a cordless """"ultra"""" pen, instead of a mouse, to enable artists to draw, paint and trace images more naturally."
7/22/1995	STOCK FALLS 7% FOLLOWING DECLINE IN EARNINGS	The stock of Apple Computer Inc. fell 7 percent in heavy trading yesterday, a day after the company said its third-quarter income fell 25 percent, well below Wall Street's expectations. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., said late on Thursday that it was having trouble producing enough of its Power Mac computers to meet demand, citing a shortage of chips and other components. Despite the slide in profits, sales were up 20 percent from a year earlier. Apple's shares closed at $43.75, down $3.1875, in Nasdaq trading of almost 6.8 million shares yesterday.
7/21/1995	Compaq Earnings Rise 17%; Apple Net Income Down 25%	The Compaq Computer Corporation yesterday reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates and helped restore some measure of calm to the market for technology stocks. But Apple Computer Inc.'s earnings for its fiscal third quarter -- reported after the stock market had closed -- fell far short of estimates, and its shares fell in after-hours trading.
7/17/1995	Apple Computer to Offer 2 New Macintosh Models	Apple Computer Inc. will introduce two Macintosh models today in its consumer-oriented Performa line, offering aggressive pricing and advanced multimedia features. The machines play to Apple's strengths in the publishing, education, multimedia and consumer markets. The two models, together with software and services aimed at specific market segments, will help Apple regain market share this year and next, Michael Spindler, Apple's president and chief executive, said at a news briefing. Rather than compete across the board with PC clones of dubious quality, Mr. Spindler said, Apple will focus its efforts. Though its overall market share is about 8.3 percent, in certain markets the Macintosh has a dominant share, and this can be increased, he said.
7/17/1995	Companies Use Web Hoping to Save Millions	The Internet's World Wide Web -- that great repository of data -- has yet to become that great market. But right now a number of innovative service-oriented companies are using the Web not to make money but to save some -- and not nickels and dimes either, but possibly millions of dollars. For companies ranging from overnight package deliverers to banks, the Web is the place to offer technology-savvy customers a new convenience: automated customer service. In the process, these companies are finding that a Web site is a lot cheaper than operating customer phone banks.
7/12/1995	APPLE'S NEWTON CHIEF IS HIRED BY CADENCE DESIGN	"Cadence Design Systems Inc., a developer of computer-aided design software, said yesterday that it had hired the head of Apple Computer's Newton hand-held computer unit, Shane Robison, as its senior vice president of engineering. Mr. Robison, 41, took over Apple's Personal Interactive Electronics business after Gaston Bastiaens left in April 1994. Cadence, based in San Jose, Calif., counts Apple as one of its largest customers. The company said Mr. Robison would bring a strong engineering background as well as management talent. An Apple spokeswoman said Mr. Robison's departure """"doesn't diminish Apple's commitment"""" to the Newton."
6/27/1995	A Powerful Machine, a Better Bus	"Apple's much anticipated overhaul of its Macintosh family is expected to occur in August, bringing a new generation of Power PC microprocessors to its desktop and portable computers. But Apple gave an early preview of the new systems last week when it introduced the high-end Power Macintosh 9500, code-named Tsunami. The Power Mac 9500 was designed to appeal to professional graphic artists, publishers, multimedia software developers and other demanding Macintosh users who can say """"768 megabytes of RAM and several gigabytes of hard disk, please"""" without giggling. It essentially replaces the Power Mac 8100/110, which has been in chronically short supply anyway."
6/26/1995	Video conferencing technology, hyped for so long, may finally be near.	HUMANS so rely on facial expressions to convey emotion that we usually try to replicate them, when we are separated by time and space, in other forms of communication. Early in the development of electronic mail, users invented emoticons -- sideways faces formed like this one : ) with the aid of punctuation marks -- as an antidote to the inevitable misunderstandings that result when people type at each other instead of talking face-to-face.
6/20/1995	For Nonprogrammers	PROGRAMMING is not for most of us. It requires both excruciating attention to detail and a creative bent. Both left brain and right brain work hard. But programming does not require vast knowledge of mathematics, at least beyond the grade-school-to-early-college levels. Basic arithmetic helps, as it does in the rest of life, and algebra and a touch of symbolic logic can reward a programmer, but Godel's theorem is not required reading.
6/20/1995	I.B.M. Takes Step to Offer Apple's Software	The International Business Machines Corporation took a step yesterday toward offering the software that underlies Apple Computer Inc.'s popular Macintosh, but I.B.M. executives were vague about how closely they would embrace their rival and partner. The statements, which were made during the announcement of I.B.M.'s new Power Series computers, confused many analysts, illustrating the difficulty the company has had articulating its strategy for the new line.
6/19/1995	I.B.M. to Introduce New Computer Line With Power PC Chip	The International Business Machines Corporation will introduce a new generation of personal computers today, the first major change to the I.B.M. PC's basic design since the company set the industry standard in the early 1980's. But instead of the favorable buzz that normally accompanies such announcements, I.B.M. faces embarrassment for having delayed the introduction of the new technology and for giving the Microsoft Corporation, its archrival, a head start over I.B.M.'s own struggling software.
6/1/1995	The Pop Life	Music Festival
5/23/1995	AT&T ALLOWS APPLE'S VIDEOCONFERENCING ON ITS NETWORK	The AT&T Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. announced an agreement yesterday to allow Apple's videoconferencing software to run over AT&T's network. AT&T, the nation's largest network company, previously had arrangements with the makers of I.B.M.-compatible personal computers and Unix-based work stations. The new agreement lets owners of Apple's computers using Quick-Time Conferencing technology to have video conferences with all others linked through a service that AT&T markets as Worldworx. Quick-Time Conferencing technology, a software-based architecture, lets personal computer users communicate via audio, video and data.
5/23/1995	EMI Finally Advances Into Multimedia	EMI Music, the only major record company that is not part of a diversified media conglomerate, is leaping into multimedia. The company is expected to announce a series of alliances today to produce CD-ROM's and on-line services based on the music of EMI artists like the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner and the Beastie Boys.
5/15/1995	Apple Offering Newton Rebates	"Apple Computer Inc. is offering rebates of as much as $100 to buyers of its miniature computer, the Newton Messagepad. The rebates on the hand-held computers, which sell for about $600, run through July 31. Customers who buy just the Messagepad are eligible for a $50 rebate. Those who buy extra storage, a fax modem or other """"qualified"""" accessories can get a $100 rebate, the company said."
5/11/1995	Hall of Fame Names Three Advertisers	"The New York chapter of the American Marketing Association has added three advertisers to those that """"have built their names into outstanding brands"""" -- Apple Computer Inc., the Walt Disney Company and the MTV Networks unit of Viacom Inc. -- by naming them to its Marketing Hall of Fame. They will be honored on June 7 at a ceremony to present the 27th annual Effie Awards, which recognize effectiveness in advertising."
5/4/1995	End Is Sought To Videodisk Format Rivalry	Hoping to put an end to a fierce format rivalry, a group of leading American computer companies has urged Japanese and European consumer electronics companies to develop a unified standard for the digital videodisk, a highly anticipated future product. The computer industry committee, composed of technical experts from Apple Computer, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Microsoft, did not endorse either the system proposed by the Toshiba Corporation or a rival system developed by Sony and Philips Electronics N.V. Each computer company will decide on its own which format, if any, to support.
5/2/1995	Safe, Friendly, Small Neighborhood	APPLE COMPUTER INC.'S Eworld on-line information service, the latest stop on our tour of cyberspace communities, will celebrate its first anniversary this summer by adding Internet access and some multimedia features. With the forthcoming Internet links, Eworld stands the best chance of any of the second-tier networks of joining the leaders of the consumer on-line industry. Or, it may instead become a good example of a popular niche network, one that has a distinct personality and a valuable set of features that appeal to a loyal but limited community of users.
5/1/1995	Russia Awakens To the World Of Computers	"Everyone has his own idea of heaven. For Nikolai Gereshenko, it's a place driven by a Pentium computer chip. """"This is the fastest thing I have ever seen,"""" said the wide-eyed, sallow-skinned salesman, as he sat mesmerized last week before a 21-inch monitor set up at Comtek, Russia's enormous annual computer show. """"I really want one of these. They are expensive, but how can we live without them? I'd even trade my car for one."
4/21/1995	Apple Earnings Rise Fourfold, But Still Below Expectations	Stung by a surprising loss in foreign-currency dealings, Apple Computer Inc. reported earnings today that fell far short of Wall Street's expectations, even though they surged nearly fourfold. Even without the currency losses, Apple earnings were at the low end of analysts' estimates.
4/18/1995	APPLE REDUCES PRICES OF POWERBOOK UP TO 27%	Apple Computer Inc. reduced prices yesterday on its Powerbook notebook computers by as much as 27 percent. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it had also added a new configuration to the Powerbook 150 line, with a bigger hard drive at lower prices.
4/17/1995	First of Mac Clones To Be Offered Today	The Power Computing Corporation, a tiny start-up company led by one of the original copiers of the I.B.M. personal computer, is expected to introduce the first clones of the Apple Macintosh today. The arrival of copy-cat computers that run the Macintosh operating system are the core of Apple Computer Inc.'s new strategy to increase its stalled market share and slow sales of Intel-based PC's that use the Windows software of the Microsoft Corporation, which now outsell the Macintosh computers by an estimated 10 to 1.
4/17/1995	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: The Executive Computer; It took a while, but an industrial-strength visual development tool for the Macintosh is in the works.	FEW businesses need a new word processor with more features than Microsoft Word or a spreadsheet with prettier pie charts than Lotus 1-2-3. But businesses do need software development tools that let them create custom applications quickly. To provide companies with that ability, an array of visual programming tools has emerged, like the Microsoft Corporation's Visual Basic, or Powerbuilder by Powersoft, which allow software developers to create applications by point-and-click and drag-and-drop, rather than by laboriously writing thousands of lines of computer code. Now the Oracle Corporation, which owns more than half the market for corporate data-base management software, is set to enter the fray, with a tool called Power Objects.
4/10/1995	The Executive Computer	"AS the first clones of the Macintosh begin to reach customers in the coming months, Apple Computer Inc. may be learning there's wisdom in the old adage, """"Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it."""" In November, Apple began handing out licenses to its crown jewel, the Macintosh operating system, and acknowledged that it should have done so years earlier."
4/5/1995	Apple Sales Chief Out in Cloning Struggle	Ian Diery, the man who led Apple Computer's United States sales organization and hardware business, has resigned after losing an internal struggle in which he opposed the decision to encourage the cloning of its computers, Apple announced today. Apple said that Mr. Diery was stepping down as part of a reorganization of the company along more functional lines, combining its hardware and software development organizations into a single unit along with three other divisions.
3/29/1995	Apple Stock Falls on Chip-Supply Concern	The shares of Apple Computer Inc. dropped nearly 8 percent yesterday on concerns about possible shortages of chips for its new lines of desktop and notebook computers. Apple has said it will introduce the products, based on the Power PC microprocessor, in late March or early April. An analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., Lucianne Painter, said it now appeared that Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., would not release the desktop system until early summer, and the notebooks could be delayed until fall.
3/27/1995	Microsoft Sues Apple Computer	Microsoft filed a counterclaim on Friday in response to a suit by Apple Computer that accuses Intel and Microsoft of misappropriating technology vital to multimedia software. On Feb. 9, Apple added Microsoft and Intel to a lawsuit it had filed against the San Francisco Canyon Company. Apple has contended that without its permission, San Francisco Canyon had given Intel, the chip maker, and Microsoft, the software publisher, software that had originally been developed for Apple.
3/22/1995	APPLE DISCLOSES SHORTAGES OF HIGH-END UNITS	"The chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., Michael H. Spindler, acknowledged yesterday that the company had problems filling orders for its top-of-the-line Power Macintosh personal computers and other models because of poor planning and component shortages. """"We were a little timid"""" in forecasting, Mr. Spindler said at a news conference in London. """"As a result, we left some money on the table."""" Mr. Spindler said Apple was """"limited by chips"""" in some of its machines. Last week, two analysts cut their ratings for Apple because of Power Macintosh shortages, causing shares of the company to fall 8 percent, to $35 a share. The high-speed Power PC chip for the high-end computers was jointly developed by Apple and the International Business Machines Corporation. Shares of Apple rose $1 yesterday, to $36.25, in Nasdaq trading."
3/9/1995	I.B.M. Cleared by Jury In a Stress Injury Case	A Minnesota jury decided today that I.B.M. was not liable for injuries a former high school secretary said had been caused by the design of its computer keyboards. The case has been closely watched by makers of office equipment and lawyers around the country for thousands of clerical workers who believe that poorly designed data processing equipment has led to an epidemic of neck, shoulder, arm and hand ailments collectively known as repetitive stress injuries, or R.S.I. While the ruling does not set a direct precedent for what juries can decide in other cases, it will encourage equipment companies not to settle such claims.
2/28/1995	Apple Settles Lawsuit on Repetitive Stress Injury	Faced with a damaging blunder by its lawyers, Apple Computer Inc. has dropped its effort to fight a claim by a former high school secretary that the company was partly to blame for disabling injuries to her hands and wrists. The tactical misstep leaves I.B.M. as the sole defendant in the case, which has been closely watched by lawyers for thousands of clerical workers who believe that poorly designed data processing equipment has led to a wide variety of neck, shoulder, arm and hand ailments collectively known as repetitive stress injuries, or R.S.I.
2/21/1995	A Machine That Bridges 2 Worlds	"FOR the young Macintosh enthusiast, it was agony. He had access to a Mac Quadra computer with a CD-ROM drive, but a relative had given him two tantalizing Windows CD-ROM programs, """"Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time"""" and """"Wing Commander III."""" Spending $2,000 or more for a Windows multimedia computer just to run the games was out of the question, given the pittance he received each week for his allowance. And Dad's Windows machine had been off limits ever since the young man replaced all of its boring system sounds with an assortment of belches, sneezes, screams and other rude noises."
2/13/1995	Japanese Will Make a Mac-Compatible PC	"The Pioneer Electronic Corporation will become the first Japanese company to make a personal computer compatible with Apple Computer's Macintosh, industry officials said on Friday. Pioneer scheduled a news conference for Wednesday to announce the development of a personal computer with the """"cooperation"""" of Apple."
2/12/1995	The Executive Computer; Is Video Conferencing Coming of Age?	"IF there were an official ranking of hype, somewhere on the list between low-fat junk food and the O. J. Simpson trial might be the term """"video conferencing."""" But if Apple Computer and other industry players are right, this could be the year video conferencing finally lives up to its promise. At an industry trade show in San Francisco last week, Apple announced a new software technology that has the very real potential of driving down the cost of personal video-conferencing equipment, while solving some of the problems that have nagged this talking-heads technology since it first arrived on personal computers a few years ago."
2/9/1995	The point-and-click universe is expanding into movies, television and marketing campaigns.	DIALOGUE boxes. Pull-down menus. Tool bars. Windows. Icons. Button strips. Arrows. Screen savers. These are the visual signatures of the mouse-controlled computer screen, and they are everywhere these days -- in television and print advertisements, in feature films and in television dramas and sitcoms.
1/24/1995	Lotus Makes Price Cuts On Notes	The Lotus Development Corporation yesterday announced a new, cheaper version of its hot-selling Notes groupware product and a price cut for the full version of Notes, in a bid to widen its lead in the growing market for such communications software. Lotus also announced agreements with I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. to ship a scaled-down version of the product called Notes Express with I.B.M.'s new OS/2 Warp operating system and certain Apple Power Macintosh and Powerbook computers. Jim Manzi, Lotus's president and chief executive, said these alliances could lead to millions of new Notes users.
1/24/1995	Some Simple Tools For Sunday Painters	OWNING a computer and a painting program will not make most of us artists, any more than owning oil paints, brushes and canvases will. But whether Rembrandt or Richard Roe, an artist or would-be artist needs the proper tools. Flying Colors, from Davidson & Associates of Torrance, Calif., phone (800) 545-7677, provides many: stamps (images); an eraser; brushes; ovals and rectangles both solid and hollow, and patterns. On the monitor of a computer running Windows 3.1 with 256 colors, the screen is so sparkling that you may hesitate to mar it with your own efforts.
1/20/1995	Apple Has Big Increase In Earnings	Buoyed by strong Christmas sales, Apple Computer Inc. reported today that its earnings surged more than fourfold in its first fiscal quarter, far exceeding Wall Street analysts' estimates. Apple said that it had shipped its one-millionth Power Macintosh personal computer or upgrade, reaching this milestone two months ahead of plan, or 10 months after introduction of its systems based on the Power PC microprocessor jointly developed by Apple, Motorola and I.B.M.
1/20/1995	From Mac Users, Fury at Microsoft	Can great big software companies write truly great computer programs? The question is being raised by users of Apple Macintosh computers, who are widely reviling and rejecting the newest version by the Microsoft Corporation of its word processing program, Word, for use on the Macintosh. Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, dominates the market for Macintosh software, including a 65 percent share of Macintosh word processing programs.
1/17/1995	The Joys of Upgrading An Everyday System	IT was past time. I had avoided upgrading the workaday Macintosh, a Quadra 660AV, to System 7.5 from 7.1, because of a strong disinclination to make a major change during a big project. Now the project is finished. The installation, from a CD-ROM, went smoothly. The machine seems faster, and Wordperfect 3.0 has definitely speeded up. The most noticeable addition is that the Apple menu is now hierarchical; when you pull it down from under the Apple logo at the upper left corner, rightward-pointing triangles next to some of the entries lead to submenus. Selecting Control Panels, for example, offers access to all the control panels in the system folder -- ways of adjusting color, keyboard, mouse and more -- without leaving a running program. That also means that the Apple menu is huge. With the eight items I have added to it because they represent programs I like to be able to get at easily, there are now 18 choices, so many that the list scrolls off the screen.
1/12/1995	APPLE COMPUTER SHARES RISE ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION	Shares of Apple Computer Inc. rose 7 percent yesterday on renewed speculation about a possible takeover. The stock gained $3.0625, to $46.75, on Nasdaq volume of 7.8 million shares. Dan Dorfman, a business news correspondent for CNBC, said an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, Bruce Lupatkin, had told him that the International Business Machines Corporation would eventually acquire Apple for $60 a share. Both Apple and I.B.M. declined to comment. Shares of I.B.M. fell 62.5 cents, to $76, on the New York Stock Exchange.
1/7/1995	Apple Shares Up on Rumor Of Takeover	Shares in Apple Computer Inc. rose sharply today on the latest speculation that the company could be the target of a takeover bid. Apple's stock jumped $3.125, to $42, in Nasdaq trading, and it was the most actively traded issue today, with more than nine million shares changing hands, almost five times its recent daily trading average.
1/4/1995	A Change in Wireless Computing	The long-heralded era of wireless computing will draw a step closer Wednesday when the Motorola Corporation introduces a version of Apple Computer's Newton hand-held computer that can transmit electronic mail using radio signals. The new machine, known as the Marco Wireless Communicator, will be priced between $900 and $1,400 and weigh 1.8 pounds. It will permit users to send and receive electronic messages without being connected to a land-based telephone line.
12/29/1994	For Apple, Clones and Competition	Apple Computer Inc. has picked its first Macintosh clone maker, a little-known company that may soon give Apple some tough competition. Since Apple announced in September that it would begin licensing its Macintosh operating system, there was speculation that the company would first choose a large personal computer maker like Acer America to produce Macintosh-compatible machines. But Apple has turned to the Power Computing Corporation, a start-up company led by Stephen S. Kahng.
12/27/1994	PC Sales Over Holidays Rose 33% From '93 Level	Consumers bought a record number of personal computers this holiday shopping season, despite a shortage of some popular systems. Sales of personal computers from mid-November through Christmas were up 33 to 35 percent over the similar period last year, said David M. Goldstein, president of the Channel Marketing Corporation, an electronics consulting and market research company in Dallas, which tracks holiday retail sales through daily surveys of stores. Thirty to 35 percent of personal computers for home use were purchased in the fourth quarter of the year, he said.
12/27/1994	From a Tiny Flaw, a Major Lesson	WHEN Macintosh users count their blessings for 1994, many will rejoice that they are counting them on a Power PC microprocessor instead of a Pentium chip. Sorry. The original intent of this year-end column was to celebrate a few of the more interesting Macintosh products of 1994, including the Power PC microprocessor, not to dwell upon the Intel Corporation's much publicized problem with its flagship chip.
12/25/1994	The Executive Computer; In Marketing Wars, Apple Holds Its Fire	IF there was ever any question which was the kinder, gentler computer company -- Apple Computer or I.B.M. -- their respective handlings of the recent missteps at Intel and Microsoft should set aside all doubt. I.B.M. played pit bull, Apple pussycat. It doesn't necessarily mean that the people at Apple are fundamentally nicer -- just that they have their own good reasons for diplomacy.
12/20/1994	KALEIDA LABS SHIPS SCRIPTX MULTIMEDIA PROGRAMS	"Kaleida Labs Inc., owned by Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation, began shipping its long-delayed ScriptX computer programming language yesterday. ScriptX lets video and computer graphics professionals merge video, sound, music and computer-based special effects into """"multimedia"""" software. ScriptX has been delayed because Kaleida was juggling several other projects along with ScriptX. In May, displaying impatience with the delays, I.B.M. and Apple told Kaleida to cut 20 percent of its staff of 126 and focus on ScriptX."
12/13/1994	CD-ROM Review; The Hardware Choices: On PC's, CD's Can Be a Pain	ON Apple Macintosh computers, installing CD-ROM hardware and software is not quite as simple as connecting an audio compact disk player or playing a music CD, but it comes close. On other machines, the process can be a pain. The simplest way to get multimedia hardware for DOS and Windows is to buy a computer conforming to the Multimedia PC Level 2 standard (MPC2), which demands, at a minimum, a 486 SX/25 microprocessor, a double-speed CD-ROM drive and a 16-bit sound card. Another way, if you have a sufficiently powerful machine, is to buy an MPC2 upgrade kit ($200 and up): sound card, CD-ROM drive and, often, free programs and cheesy speakers.
12/13/1994	A Simple Argument for the Mac	FOR more than a decade the Apple Macintosh personal computer has set the standard for ease of use. It is still the easiest one to set up, learn to use, operate and upgrade. The Mac remains innovative in several technical areas and currently offers the most powerful microprocessor and the most intuitive operating system software on the market. It is an ideal platform for the multimedia and graphics-intensive software that makes personal computing so much fun these days.
12/13/1994	CD-ROM Review; Disks for Mac: Voyager Still Leads	Far more CD-ROM titles are produced for Windows-based personal computers than for the Apple Macintosh, even though the Mac is arguably the preferred machine for exploiting CD-ROM technology. Still, there are scores of interesting Mac CD-ROM titles from which to choose, especially if one has the System 7 operating system and at least 4MB of system memory. Many CD-ROM's are produced in dual versions that can be used on either a Mac or a Windows machine. In such cases, the instructions for using the CD-ROM disks, in this case a language instruction program, are enlightening:
12/12/1994	Apple Lawsuit May Renew Legal Battle With Microsoft	Apple Computer Inc. has filed suit against a small San Francisco software developer in a case that may reignite a legal quarrel between Apple and the mighty Microsoft Corporation, its principal competitor in operating software. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., filed the complaint Dec. 6 in Federal District Court in San Jose, accusing a small Apple contractor, the San Francisco Canyon Company, of theft of intellectual property and breach of contract.
12/1/1994	From Apple's Chairman, Potshots at the PC Vision	Whoa, there, wide-eyed computer industry executives. Michael H. Spindler, Apple Computer's chairman, has some words of caution: You have too much vision.
11/24/1994	Group Seeks A Bridge for PC Systems	I.B.M., AT&T, Apple and Siemens will announce next Wednesday a plan to create a universal communication language for computers and computer networks. The agreement would standardize the way that computers talk to each other, erasing the communications difficulties between a notebook computer, for example, and an office network of personal computers.
11/21/1994	Apple Lawyer Will Become New Director Of Gay Group	The nation's largest gay political organization has reached into the corporate world for an executive director to guide it through what promises to be a tumultuous period in the gay-rights movement. Elizabeth Birch, the 38-year-old chief litigator at Apple Computer Inc., is to be named today as executive director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an organization that is based in Washington and claims more than 80,000 members. The fund fights discrimination against homosexuals through organizing, lobbying and financial support for political candidates.
11/18/1994	I.B.M. Plans To License Macintosh	"Confirming longstanding computer industry speculation, I.B.M. said yesterday that it expected to license the Macintosh operating system from Apple Computer Inc. and install it on I.B.M. personal computers. """"Are we going to offer the Mac operating system preloaded on our machines? Yes, we are going to do that, assuming our customers want it,"""" Roger Bolton, a spokesman for the International Business Machines Corporation, said in an interview. Mr. Bolton said I.B.M. would not modify the Macintosh system."
11/15/1994	EXPANSION OF A BRITISH INTERACTIVE TV TRIAL IS PLANNED	The Oracle Corporation and BT, formerly British Telecommunications P.L.C., plan to expand their British interactive television services trial to 2,500 homes in the middle of 1995. Previously, the service has been delivered to the homes of BT employees. The system will offer consumers living in Colchester and Ipswich, England, movies-on-demand, home shopping and other services. The service uses a set-top controller based on an Apple Macintosh computer.
11/15/1994	Apple's PC's Top Shipments	"Apple Computer Inc. topped the Compaq Computer Corporation for third-quarter shipments of personal computers in the United States, the global market research company Dataquest Inc. said today. Apple shipped more than 600,000 PC's, the most in what Dataquest said was the largest quarter ever for the United States PC market. Apple's Power Mac, representing 25 percent of Apple's total shipping volume, is on pace to surpass the company's projected shipment of one million units by March. """"Obviously, the pent-up demand for high performance on the Macintosh platform is greater than even Apple expected,"""" Philippe de Marcillac of Dataquest said."
11/13/1994	The Executive Computer; Can Apple and I.B.M. Go It Together?	"APPLE COMPUTER and I.B.M. have defined the personal computer industry at least once each separately, perhaps twice in Apple's case. Can they do it again together? The answer is yes, but not without a lot of qualifiers. So dominant is the design originated by I.B.M., which is based on a microprocessor from Intel and operating system software from Microsoft, that no new platform is likely to supplant it. But if they move quickly, and with few missteps, Apple and I.B.M -- two of the three largest PC makers -- can create a viable alternative. Last week, Apple, I.B.M. and Motorola announced that they would jointly develop a hardware blueprint for computers based on the PowerPC microprocessor they have jointly produced. The new machine would be a computing chameleon, able to run operating systems like I.B.M.'s OS/2, Apple's Mac OS, and versions of Unix from I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems. As does Apple's Power Macintosh, the new machine could run Microsoft Windows, but only under """"emulation"""" -- a """"let's pretend"""" software technique that has never been totally satisfying. Critics were quick to cry """"too little, too late,"""" saying that the companies should have reached this agreement three years ago when they began work on the PowerPC chip. And there was the loud sound of just one shoe falling: where was an agreement by Apple to license Mac OS to I.B.M.? Trade publications have reported that Apple will disclose licensing plans tomorrow at the Comdex computer convention in Las Vegas, but the company has declined to comment. The projected delivery date of the hardware design, sometime in 1996, also seemed too far away to matter, leaving Microsoft and Intel to carve up the market in the meantime. """"If this lands in mid-1996, who cares?"""" asked Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest. """"Why would anyone invest in this merged platform unless Apple licenses the operating system?"""" But corporate buyers were more receptive to the proposed machine than were the pundits. They like the idea of a single computer that could run all the multiple operating systems they live with today on multiple computers, which would reduce confusion and lower technical support costs. Just knowing such a machine is coming makes buying a Power Macintosh a safer choice today, because there is a migration path. Also, the oft-projected decline and fall of the Macintosh line of computers -- usually based on the argument that it has attained only a 10 percent share of the market -- would seem a false prophecy. During the third quarter, for example, Apple's United States shipments of 640,000 Macintosh's made it the leading personal computer for that period, ahead of Compaq at 600,000 and I.B.M. at 500,000, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research organization based in Framingham, Mass. Personal computers based on Intel or Intel-compatible microprocessors and Microsoft's Windows operating systems (the kind that used to be called I.B.M.-compatible) are going through a transition of their own -- from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95. This is more than a simple software upgrade; it is a shift from a 16-bit operating system to one that processes data in 32-bit chunks. That potentially rocky road to Wellville could create an opportunity for alternatives, like a new platform from I.B.M. and Apple. """"The market power of these two companies is greater than the sum of their market shares,"""" said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix. """"Most people who have criticized this venture have focused on today. This is not about today,"""" he continued. """"This is about the 32-bit environment, which will grow and come to dominate the market by the end of the decade."""" For many years already, Apple's Macintosh has been a 32-bit machine running a 32-bit operating system. I.B.M.'s recently introduced OS/2 Warp is a 32-bit operating system. But Microsoft is still making the transition to a 32-bit operating system with Windows 95, which will not ship until some time next year. Windows NT, Microsoft's more advanced operating system introduced last year, is a 32-bit system. But so far it has achieved only modest market penetration, and only as a """"server"""" system on large networks, not on individual desktops. Microsoft has sought to smooth the journey to Windows 95 and 32-bit computing by seeing to it that all existing 16-bit software will run on the new system, but it's not likely to be a totally painless trip. The installed base of Windows applications insures that Windows 95 will have strong sales, but it presents the possibility of compatibility problems. A version of Windows 95 for the PowerPC chip is not likely to materialize, unless I.B.M., Apple and others achieve unexpected sales volume. Windows is written in software code that ties it closely to the internal workings of the Intel chip, and to convert it would be a major undertaking. Windows NT, however, can run on many chips, and a version for the PowerPC is in the works. One ace up I.B.M.'s sleeve is development of a much publicized but never officially confirmed version of the PowerPC microprocessor that incorporates emulation into the chip itself. In theory, this hardware emulation would allow machines using the chip to run Windows applications at speeds so close to their """"native"""" performance on Intel boxes that the difference would be moot. With the added benefit of running Macintosh, OS/2, Unix and Windows NT applications, such a machine would appeal to shops using a mix of hardware. But the performance of this mystery chip or of the coming joint Apple-I.B.M. computer design had better be good. """"The real challenge they face is having compatibility real enough and fast enough, because the installed base is everything,"""" said a PC buyer for a Big Six accounting firm, who spoke on the condition he not to be identified. """"It better be double the performance"""" of competing machines, """"because it's not like PC makers or Microsoft are gouging on price,"""" he said. Others say outperforming Microsoft and Intel at their own game is a long shot. They see the new machine as a Mac clone. Apple has said it will license its operating system when the hardware specification is complete; in any case one could purchase Mac OS separately and run it on the new machine. In addition to I.B.M., Apple and Motorola, companies developing or producing PowerPC-based machines include: Bull Systems, Canon, FirePower, Hitachi, Power Computing, 3DO, the Taiwan New PC Consortium and Toshiba. Many are likely to seek Mac OS licenses when Apple makes them available. """"Where I.B.M. and Apple would have a real advantage is if they would combine their operating systems,"""" said John McKenna, president of Entex Information Systems in Ryebrook, N.Y., which claims to be the largest reseller of PC's to corporate customers. """"Suppose I.B.M. were to throw all its weight behind integrating the Mac operating system."""" It would be no large task for I.B.M. to add its own extensions to the Macintosh that would make it an ideal """"client"""" in networked computer systems using I.B.M.'s mainframes and minicomputers. But for I.B.M. to fully embrace the Macintosh operating system would seem a step back from its commitment to the OS/2 operating system, on which it has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars. Similarly, for Apple, the prospect of licensing Mac OS to the company it once equated with George Orwell's Big Brother must cause at least a mild shudder. """"The real question,"""" said Seymour Merrin, a consultant to the PC industry who is based in Mountain View, Calif., """"is whether any product can be developed by I.B.M. and Apple when their own businesses are the biggest obstacle to anything getting done,"
11/8/1994	I.B.M.-Apple PC Deal Meets With Skepticism	"Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M. formally announced today their plan to build a personal computer that will run either company's software. But many experts remained skeptical about the companies' chances of dominating the computer industry unless they also eventually agreed to pursue a single software strategy. """"They actually need the same software on every machine,"""" said Phil Lemmons, editor in chief of PC World magazine, a trade publication."
11/7/1994	Caution Greets Plan On New PC	Attempting to regain the leadership roles that each once held in the personal computer market, I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. will announce today the details of their plan to develop a shared computer design. Many corporate buyers, companies that sell computers and computer industry consultants say they welcome the development but made clear that they were skeptical about its prospects for success.
11/4/1994	After 3 Years, a PC Alliance Is Ready to Fight	Consolidating a three-year-old alliance that had seemed to be faltering, Apple Computer, I.B.M. and Motorola will announce on Monday a new personal computer design with the backing of several other big computer makers. The alliance is considered by many in the industry to be the companies' last best hope of breaking the domination of the PC market by machines using chips from the Intel Corporation and software from the Microsoft Corporation.
10/19/1994	Market Place; Apple may defy the doomsayers, even in the long run.	IS Apple Computer for sale? Despite a gangbuster quarter that suggests the company's Power Macintosh family of personal computers is taking off, conventional wisdom suggests that Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., will soon wilt before the inevitable onslaught of a yet-to-be-shipped and untested Microsoft operating system, Windows 95.
10/18/1994	Apple Computer's Earnings Soar, but Its Stock Slumps $1.375	Apple Computer Inc. reported late today that its earnings soared in its fiscal fourth quarter, exceeding Wall Street's estimates. Investors, who had enjoyed a significant run up in share prices in recent weeks, sold shares heavily near the close of trading, causing the stock price to drop $1.375, to close at $39.75 in Nasdaq trading. The earnings were not announced until after the close, but traders were locking in profits, rather than risking a surprise that would send shares sliding.
10/11/1994	Apple Stock Continues Sharp Rise	Shares in Apple Computer Inc. continued their sharp rise today, in reaction to reports that Apple and I.B.M. were making progress toward agreeing on a common standard that would make each company's computers compatible with the other's. The International Business Machines Corporation also released new versions of the Power PC microprocessor today that it developed with Apple and Motorola Inc. and lowered prices on some existing chips.
10/10/1994	Apple and I.B.M. Are Seen Close to PC Accord	Executives of Apple Computer and I.B.M. are close to agreeing on a common standard that would make the computers each company produces compatible with one another, industry executives familiar with the discussions said yesterday. For consumers, such a standard would mean they could buy a single machine that, without any modifications, would run software using several different operating systems: OS/2, which is the operating system that I.B.M. promotes; Apple's Macintosh and the Windows NT program made by the Microsoft Corporation.
10/6/1994	Rumors of Motorola Move Spur Apple Computer Rise	Shares of Apple Computer Inc. soared today after rumors circulated that Motorola Inc. might make a substantial equity investment in Apple or acquire it outright. Neither company would comment. The rumors stemmed from the announcement by Motorola on Tuesday that it intended to enter the personal computer business with a product based on the Power PC chip jointly developed by Apple, Motorola and the International Business Machines Corporation.
10/4/1994	I.B.M. and Motorola Plan Debut of Power PC Lines	Continuing efforts to establish their Power PC microprocessor chip as a standard in products ranging from home electronics and video games to the most powerful computers, I.B.M. and Motorola Inc. plan separate introductions today of new Power PC machines for the corporate market. Timed to coincide with an industry trade show in Manhattan, the two introductions seemingly pit the allies, which along with Apple Computer Inc. developed the Power PC technology, against one another. Each is introducing new machines that range from powerful work stations for individuals to server computers capable of supporting tens or hundreds of workers.
9/29/1994	Power PC Gets a Lift At Toshiba	Lending strength to the faltering alliance between Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M., the Toshiba Corporation will license the alliance's Power PC microprocessor, industry officials said today. Toshiba, one of Japan's more successful computer makers, is expected to initially use the microprocessor in servers, which are powerful machines used as central data repositories in computer networks.
9/28/1994	Personal Digital Assistant, Part III	First there was the EO Personal Communicator from AT&T, which was deemed so expensive and hard to use that it is no longer made. Then came the Newton Message Pad from Apple, whose initial handwriting recognition software became the butt of jokes, and which has had total sales of only about 100,000 units after more than a year on the market. Now, hoping for better results, the consumer-electronics giant Sony Electronics is introducing the latest attempt at a portable computer-communications device -- with, as it turns out, the help of the AT&T Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. Not to mention Motorola Inc., another partner in this multi-corporate effort, in which the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan and Philips Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands also have roles.
9/20/1994	Of Soaps and Computers: What Became of I.B.M and Apple?	THE Charles and Diana of computer companies, I.B.M. and Apple, are supposed to be married but rarely appear in public together any more. Yesterday each company made a major appearance at which the other was conspicuously absent. Apple unveiled its plan to allow the development of legal Macintosh clones, while I.B.M. unveiled a new family of personal computers to replace its PS/1 line. On a practical level, there was no compelling reason for the two companies to work together on those announcements. They are, after all, competitors in the marketplace. But on another level, the one familiar to viewers of soap operas and readers of supermarket tabloids, there was a hint of Tom and Roseanne in the air.
9/14/1994	Computing's Bold Alliance Falters	It was to be the alliance of former enemies, teaming up to conquer common foes. At least that was the strategy three summers ago when I.B.M. and Apple Computer stunned their industry by announcing a joint plan to attack the domination of the personal computer industry by machines based on Intel chips and Microsoft software. Apple and I.B.M. called their planned weapon the Power PC, and to make sure they had sufficient firepower, they recruited the big chip maker Motorola Inc. to their team.
9/6/1994	Microsoft Is Bringing Out Its First Computer Keyboard	Making its second foray into the computer hardware business, the Microsoft Corporation will begin shipping a keyboard on Tuesday with a suggested retail price of $99. Microsoft said the keyboard would be broadly available through computer retailers in early October.
8/30/1994	Market Place; The booming personal computer industry defies economic gravity.	THE personal computer boom just won't quit. Wall Street analysts expect a new sales surge to drive up computer companies' stocks during the second half of the year. In June a number of Silicon Valley insiders were quietly betting that Apple Computer Inc. was about to take a fall. The rumors were that huge cutbacks in orders for disk drives signaled that the computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., was sitting on a sizable inventory.
8/14/1994	Sound Bytes; An Underwater Path to Apple	LIKE many employees of Apple Computer, David C. Nagel has held a lot of jobs in a relatively short time. His first position, as manager of application technology in Apple's Advanced Technology Group, lasted exactly one month in 1988. By 1990, he was vice president of the group, Apple's R.& D. operation. Mr. Nagel's route to Apple was typically Silicon Valley -- only on close scrutiny does its logic appear. He had been a research scientist with a passionate interest in the way people hear underwater. Later, his interests expanded to the myriad ways people learn and process information. In the early 1980's, he applied the same principles to aerospace work at NASA's Ames Research Center, where he began using a Macintosh. His affection for the Mac eventually led him to Apple.
7/27/1994	Expense Account Heyday Over, Companies Demand Cheap Fares	Many American companies, eager to cut costs, are rebelling against the airlines' 16-year-old policy of making business travelers pay higher fares than leisure travelers. These companies are finding ways for their traveling employees to save money, even if that sometimes means inconveniencing them. They are also driving harder bargains with the airlines. Apple Computer Inc., for instance, has set up a network that provides employees, working on computers, options for planning their trips, including information about the potential savings from discounts the company has negotiated with airlines.
7/26/1994	Major Update for Macs, Though Not the Big One	LAST week in this space we learned about the forthcoming Microsoft Windows 4.0 operating system, code-named Chicago. This week we can preview Apple Computer's next Macintosh operating system update, System 7.5, expected to be released in September. Chicago is the Windy City, a toddlin' town, hog-butcher to the world. If Apple's System 7.5 were a city, it would probably be New Orleans, the Big Easy. It has approximately 50 new features that make the Macintosh even easier to use. New Orleans also conjures images of jazz and gumbo and just a hint of mystery. There is all of that in System 7.5, too.
7/23/1994	Earnings Rebound At Apple	Apple Computer, showing evidence of a financial and technological comeback, reported today that stronger sales of its new Power Macintosh computers led to a 15.5 percent increase in revenue for its third quarter and higher-than-expected profits. In the corresponding quarter last year, Apple reported a loss because of charges it had taken for a corporate revamping.
7/20/1994	APPLE'S QUICKTIME IS CHOSEN FOR SET-TOP BOXES	The Bell Atlantic Corporation said Apple Computer Inc.'s Quicktime multimedia technology would be used as the software component in the television set-top boxes for its full-service telecommunications networks. Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, has said it will spend $11 billion during the next several years to upgrade its telecommunications network to offer phone, video and two-way services. The company will initially offer multimedia services in six areas in the mid-Atlantic region.
7/12/1994	A Nice, Pretty, Quiet Online Neighborhood	APPLE COMPUTER INC.'s new online information service, called E-World for Macintosh, is the prettiest and friendliest town in cyberspace. The service, which Apple is promoting with each new Macintosh computer it sells, has cute little buildings, including an entertainment center, a post office, a computer center, a school, a marketplace, a community center, a corporate skyscraper and a newsstand. While other online services are about as easy to navigate as the New York City subway system, E-World's pathways are logically laid out.
7/12/1994	Dell Computer to Abandon Retail Store Sales	Seeking to play to its strengths, the Dell Computer Corporation said yesterday that it would stop selling computers in stores and concentrate instead on direct sales to consumers. The move is expected to have little overall impact on Dell. The company has already pared its retail business to roughly 2 percent of its annual sales of $3.5 billion, and the operation is not profitable, Michael S. Dell, chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
7/11/1994	Apple Offering New System for Macintosh PC's	Stung by a growing industry perception that the Microsoft Corporation is borrowing its best ideas, Apple Computer Inc. has introduced a version of its Macintosh software intended to maintain its lead in the personal computer ease-of-use wars. The announcement on Friday came as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit prepared to hear Apple's appeal of a Federal District Court ruling in 1993 that Microsoft and the Hewlett-Packard Company did not unfairly copy the distinctive on-screen appearance and functions of the Macintosh computer. The appeal will be heard on Monday.
6/28/1994	Software Puts Meals And More On a Menu	THE city is London, the time is almost 6 P.M., and the immediate question is, what about dinner? Out comes the Newton Messagepad. Luckily, the hotel room is bright enough to see the screen. You tap the stylus on Extras, then on the Timeout London Guide icon. A menu appears, not of entrees but of options: About This Guide, Accommodations, Eating and Drinking, Entertainment, Exploring, Information and Services, London by Area, Maps, Shopping. You tap Eating and Drinking.
6/28/1994	Profit and Ego in Data Secrecy	If the web of thousands of computer networks around the world can be thought of as an information superhighway, then Jim Bidzos is one of its best-placed toll takers. Mr. Bidzos expects to become very rich -- unless the Government has its way. As president of a Silicon Valley company called RSA Data Security Inc., Mr. Bidzos, 39, controls the patents for software crucial to scrambling and unscrambling computer messages so they can be sent confidentially.
6/26/1994	Sound Bytes; Designer Opens On-Line Doors	LAST week Apple Computer Inc.'s on-line service, eWorld, passed from the nether realm of trial runs -- beta testing, in computerese -- to commercial launch. Apple licensed some technology from America Online, itself a licensee of Apple technology, so eWorld will look familiar to users of that service. The twist is that eWorld replaces America Online's simple icons and text with a whimsical drawing of a little town: click on the post office for mail, click on the library for research, click on the newsstand for, you got it, news.
6/14/1994	Virtual Reality Plans To Grow More Real	VIRTUAL reality is an experience many people associate with bizarre bug-eye helmets, electrode-studded gloves and powerful workstation computers. But two new software inventions shown last week at the Digital World conference in Los Angeles hold the promise of bringing a tame form of virtual reality to the technologically timid, without requiring them to dress as if they were going to a class reunion at the University of Mars. But first, it's time for a reality check on virtual reality.
6/14/1994	Investing in a Temporary Bargain	"WITH Apple Computer Inc. switching to a new family of processors, the reduced instruction set chips (RISC) of the Power Macs, this seems an odd time to buy one of the older Macintoshes. If everything goes according to plan, the machines will be obsolete in a year or two. But the geriatric Macs are plunging in price, and the higher-level ones can get a central processing unit transplant when a sufficient range of software has been rewritten for the new computers. Adrian Mello, the editor in chief of Macworld, writes in the July issue: """"For the time being, I recommend the Quadra 650 for those who want to have their cake and eat it too. I've seen this model priced at $2,300, and it's still the best price/ performance value among the 680X0-based Macintoshes. When the native Power Mac applications you need are ready, you should be able to purchase Apple's PowerPC upgrade card and get 66MHz PowerPC performance."
6/3/1994	Apple Project In Ukraine	Apple Computer Inc. plans to announce on Friday a software development and education project for Ukraine that is designed to take advantage of a labor force with high computer skills and low wages. In a joint agreement with the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Apple will train programmers, assign them basic programming and market Ukrainian software inventions abroad.
5/31/1994	Smile or Scowl! You're on Digital Camera!	"THE subject looked at the new camera, and the photographer, suspiciously. """"Did you remember to put film in the camera this time?"""" she asked, needlessly rubbing in the memory of the last family vacation. """"No, I didn't bring any film this time, either,"""" the photographer said. """"Big smile."
5/22/1994	The Executive Computer; Preparing for the Battle in Mix-and-Match Software	SO far in the 1990's the software business has seen a continuous battle for control of the most visible aspect of computing: the graphical user interface. In this war, Apple Computer's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows have vied for the hearts and eyes of the computing public with their competing software systems: each is based on the concept of executing commands by pointing and clicking at pictographs on a screen instead of typing arcane words or numbers.
5/17/1994	Apple Sets Standard With Its New Lineup Of Powerful Notebooks	APPLE COMPUTER INC. is back on track with its new Powerbook portable computers, which were introduced yesterday. The new Powerbooks are innovative and powerful machines that could help Apple recapture the lead it once had in the notebook computer category. Unfortunately, Apple's new Powerbooks may have also recaptured the lead in prices, with the high-end models topping out at more than $6,000. And Apple's biggest rival in high-end portable computers, the I.B.M. PC Company, is expected to introduce its own batch of innovative new Thinkpads today. Some of the new I.B.M. models will also cross the $6,000 threshold.
5/16/1994	New Line of Laptops Offered by Apple Today	Aiming to regain the high ground in the hotly contested laptop computer market, Apple Computer Inc. on Monday will introduce six models in its Powerbook line of portable Macintoshes. The new computers are available immediately, at suggested retail prices ranging from $2,269 to $5,539. A hit laptop is crucial to Apple if it is to regain market share lost to the Compaq Computer Corporation and I.B.M., both of which have been quicker to introduce more powerful machines with higher-resolution screens. Recent studies by Dataquest, a market research company based in San Jose, Calif., show Compaq edging ahead of Apple in laptop and overall personal computer sales.
5/15/1994	Sound Bytes; Maverick Remakes Kaleida	"Mike Braun compares the stresses of running a joint venture of I.B.M. and Apple Computer to those of raising teen-agers: """"They only agree when you wish they didn't."""" Mr. Braun is president and chief executive of Kaleida Labs Inc., the three-year-old joint venture of the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. that set out to create a multimedia software development language for Macintoshes, I.B.M. personal computers and compatible models and Unix computers, as well as for future interactive television devices."
5/10/1994	I.B.M.-Apple Venture To Cut Back Activities	"Three years after setting out to establish a software standard for """"interactive"""" television and computing through a joint venture called Kaleida, Apple Computer and I.B.M. have decided to scale back Kaleida's activities substantially, curtail spending and reduce its 125-member staff by more than 20 percent, according to people familiar with the decision. The decision to rein in the venture comes when the industry's development of interactive television is being slowed by regulatory uncertainty, concerns about the high costs involved and various technical issues. It also comes when both Apple and the International Business Machines Corporation are experiencing pressure on profit margins in their personal computer business."
4/26/1994	APPLE INTRODUCES COMPUTER LINE TO CONTROL NETWORKS	Apple Computer Inc. introduced a line of computers yesterday based on the PowerPC microprocessor chip to control personal computer networks. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., also announced plans to work with Novell Inc. to develop software to control communication between computers in networks of Apple units as well as in networks of other computers. The new Workgroup Servers are significantly more powerful than Apple's existing line of servers, which are computers that control data storage and traffic in networks. The collaboration with Novell will allow users of I.B.M.-compatible computers to gain access to data on Apple's servers. In Nasdaq trading yesterday, Apple rose $1.25, to $31, while Novell climbed $1.0625, to $17.50.
4/26/1994	Sun and Fujitsu to Broaden Pact to Bolster Sparc Chip	Sun Microsystems Inc. and Fujitsu Ltd. said today that they would significantly broaden their longstanding collaboration and jointly work to bolster Sun's Sparc microprocessor against competitive threats from chips made by the Intel Corporation and other companies. Sun, the world leader in engineering work stations, has long supplied its products for sale in Japan by Fujitsu, this nation's largest computer company. And Fujitsu has long manufactured Sparc microprocessors, which Sun uses in its machines.
4/22/1994	APPLE COMPUTER INC. (AAPL,NMS)	Apple Computer Inc. reported yesterday that its earnings fell 84.3 percent, to $17.4 million, in its second fiscal quarter, despite increased revenues and unit shipments. But the company said that sales of its new Power Macintosh models, introduced in March, were ahead of plan and partly compensated for slowing sales of older machines. Apple's earnings of 15 cents a share were well below the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, which was 22 cents. That did not account for a debt offering in February that cost about 5 cents a share.
4/20/1994	Toys Now, Computers Tomorrow?	Will video-game machines be the supercomputers of tomorrow? Or, put another way, will Microsoft's software hegemony be supplanted by Sonic the Hedgehog software? Questions of that sort are troubling some computer designers and executives, who are wondering whether the personal computer industry may be ripe for a fall -- soon to be overtaken by $250 video-game players and computerized boxes for the television set-top. Consumer devices that Nintendo, Sega and Sony plan to introduce over the next year will outstrip the processing power of the fastest desktop computers from Apple and I.B.M., and the speediest personal-computer chips from Intel and Motorola.
4/20/1994	Toys Now, Computers Tomorrow?	Will video-game machines be the supercomputers of tomorrow? Or, put another way, will Microsoft's software hegemony be supplanted by Sonic the Hedgehog software? Questions of that sort are troubling some computer designers and executives, who are wondering whether the personal computer industry may be ripe for a fall -- soon to be overtaken by $250 video-game players and computerized boxes for the television set-top. Consumer devices that Nintendo, Sega and Sony plan to introduce over the next year will outstrip the processing power of the fastest desktop computers from Apple and I.B.M., and the speediest personal-computer chips from Intel and Motorola. Most personal computer makers scoff at the notion that they could be unseated by such consumer gadgets. 'The personal computer industry isn't going to slow down any time soon,' said Bob Metcalfe, publisher of Infoworld, a personal computer newspaper. 'They're all in the business of slitting each others' throats while performance skyrockets.' But some industry experts recall the hubris of the big mainframe computer companies 15 years ago. In those days, most mainframe giants dismissed the PC as a hacker's toy unsuitable for business use -- only to watch brash new personal computer makers win the hearts and desktops of Corporate America and a college dropout from Seattle named Bill Gates ascend to the industry summit. Most mainframe makers have since failed or withdrawn from the field, and the remaining leader, the International Business Machines Corporation, is making money from its PC's while trying to wring profits from a mainframe business that seems to be drying up quickly. But now, personal computer makers may be no more able to take advantage of the fastest computing technologies than were mainframe computer vendors a decade ago. 'I'm struck by the quandary personal computer makers are in,' said Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America. His company plans next year to offer its $250 Project Reality video-game player, which will surpass the computing performance of even the most powerful personal computers. Besides games with interactive, TV-quality video and sound, the Project Reality player will also act as a communications device, over cable television networks. And in terms of its ability to manipulate large amounts of data, the Project Reality player will be able to operate more powerfully than the original Cray 1 supercomputer, which astounded the computing world with its speed in 1976. 'If you put something this powerful and this cheap in the market,' Mr. Lincoln said, 'what happens to everybody else?' Applications Raised Demand Demand in the personal computer industry was heightened by the creation of new applications -- spreadsheets, word processing, electronic mail; it did not simply take over old mainframe functions like payroll processing and customer billing. And now consumer electronics companies, which have already sold millions of video-game machines, are developing systems that they hope will soon offer a broad range of consumer applications for which personal computers hold no particular edge. And this home market is potentially much larger than the $66 billion annual market for personal computers. 'This is the last frontier,' said Jim Clark, the former chairman of Silicon Graphics Inc., a leading maker of powerful computer-graphics work stations that can cost $10,000 or more. Mr. Clark recently left Silicon Graphics to form his own company, which is seeking alliances with consumer electronics companies to make computerized devices that would sell for a few hundred dollars. 'We're talking about creating true consumer computers,' he said. These new consumer machines go beyond being faster and cheaper to represent a much more fundamental transformation. 'The trend is for the fastest to also be the smallest and cheapest,' said John Moussouris, cofounder of Microunity, Inc., a Silicon Valley chip maker. 'This will continue to disrupt the computer industry to a greater degree than the auto disrupted the horse and buggy, or the calculator disrupted the slide rule.' Personal computer executives deny that the new class of video-game machines and set-top 'interactive TV' players will be a threat, contending that they are highly specialized machines without the flexibility of the personal computers and without the range of software applications that suits PC's for a variety of professional, home-office and leisure activities. But the new technology renegades say that increasingly, like its mainframe predecessor, the personal computer industry is too bound to its huge installed base of products to make radical shifts toward new technology. Indeed, today's personal computer industry is even more wedded to a narrow set of 'architectures' than was the mainframe business. There were seven competitors to I.B.M. in the 1960's and 1970's; today there are only two basic personal computer designs: machines based on Intel chips and Microsoft operating systems, and machines based on Apple Computer designs. Today's consumer-oriented computing devices, by contrast, are free to follow where computing technology wants to lead. In the past computers were used almost exclusively for calculation and control. Now a new wave of computing is shifting the focus to communications. Supercomputing power is being harnessed to make home machines simple to use and to make it easier for people to communicate with each other through video, sound and data. Long Learning Curve That will represent a departure from the personal computer, which despite great strides toward 'user friendliness,' still requires considerable time and effort to learn to use. 'The conventional computer industry is going to be the funky, behind-the-times part of the business,' said Charles Ferguson, a consultant based in Cambridge, Mass. He predicts that the transition will present a new opportunity for Asian electronics giants. 'The design and software will be overwhelmingly America,' he said. 'But it's also going to be the Japanese and Koreans who will manufacture this stuff.' Also helping drive computing into the consumer-products realm is the inexorable trend in chip technology. For more than three decades, the number of transistors squeezed onto a single silicon chip has doubled approximately every 18 months. In the 1970's the world's fastest computers had more than 100,000 chips; by the end of the 1990's the fastest machine will be on a single chip. All of this can make for strange chip fellows. Several years ago, when designers at Kendall Square Research, the supercomputer maker, set about manufacturing their newest processor chip, they chose the same Sharp Electronics factory line in Japan that produces the control chips for the Sharp Wizard 'personal organizer' which sells for less than $500. And currently, looking to stay at the top of the supercomputer race, Cray Research has secretly turned to Microunity to provide microprocessors for its fastest massively parallel supercomputers. But Cray will have to share the chips with makers of television set-top boxes and videophones. Microunity's superchip is planned to execute a billion operations a second, more than 10 times Intel's fastest Pentium processor. On the software side, economics seems to be pulling toward the consumer market. In 1993 Sonic the Hedgehog II, the standard bearer for Sega's line of home video games was a $400 million software best seller, dwarfing almost all of the most popular business software titles for personal computers. Does this mean that the likes of NBA Jam will be the 'killer application' of the 90's, as Lotus 1-2-3 was for personal computing in the 80's? It is too early to say. But certainly, big money-makers like these are providing the financial wherewithal for creating a new industry, said Bruce Lupatkin, a financial analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco-based investment firm. 'The next 10 years in computing,' Mr. Lupatkin said, 'are going to be driven by automating the consumer experience.'
4/19/1994	Newton Unit Executive Quits Apple	The executive that Apple Computer Inc. hired to introduce its Newton handheld computer resigned today, and analysts said he had been forced out by Apple's inability to spur lagging sales of the pen-based machine. Gaston Bastiaens, a former executive of Philips Electronics, had served as general manager of Apple's personal interactive electronics division, which developed and markets the Newton. In a statement issued late in the day, Apple said Mr. Bastieaens was leaving to set up his own business.
4/14/1994	APPLE REPORTS WEAKER-THAN-EXPECTED SALES OF NEWTON	"The president and chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., Michael H. Spindler, said yesterday that sales of the company's Newton Message Pad, heralded by Apple as the future of computing, had been """"weaker than expected."""" Mr. Spindler, speaking at a presentation in Toronto, declined to give specific sales figures. He blamed what he called retailers' inability to present the product to customers for its poor sales performance. """"People don't buy it if it just sits there,"""" Mr. Spindler said. """"You have to explain the product."""" The Newton, a hand-held computer with optional paging and wireless faxing functions, has been plagued by glitches since its introduction last July."
4/12/1994	New Top Officer at Intuit Is Former Apple Executive	Intuit Inc., the fast-growing personal finances software company, said today that it had named William V. Campbell, a former executive of Apple Computer Inc., as its president and chief executive. Mr. Campbell, 53, succeeds Scott D. Cook, 41, Intuit's founder, who continues as the company's chairman. Mr. Cook remains the largest shareholder in Intuit, which went public last year. Intuit shares closed today at $32.75, up 87.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading; the company made its announcement after the market's close.
3/22/1994	The New Power Macs Seen as a Triple Threat	APPLE'S new Power Macintoshes have been unveiled at last. There is a price war in the air, the software makers are making sweet promises, the competition is bellowing, and Macintosh shoppers are emerging from hibernation. Spring has come once again to the computer industry. The Power Mac desktop computers introduced last week at Lincoln Center in New York represent the most significant new products developed by Apple Computer Inc. in several years, at least since the Powerbook portables.
3/15/1994	Market Place; Sun Microsystems says reports of its demise are premature.	"WHILE the technology world's focus has been on Apple's faster Macintosh line, which was displayed yesterday, and Intel's recently announced quicker Pentium chip, it has been easy to discount Sun Microsystems, the leading maker of computer work stations. In fact, the common wisdom in Silicon Valley has been that Sun would simply be gored by the twin horns of ever-cheaper and faster personal computers and Microsoft's commercially oriented NT operating system. But Sun, which prides itself at being both quirky and arrogant, has been counted out before. """"As usual, reports of our demise are premature,"""" said Eric Schmidt, Sun's chief technology officer. Now the computer maker is set to catch up in the work station business and may end up giving fits to its chief competitors -- Hewlett Packard, Digital Equipment, Silicon Graphics and I.B.M. Sun, which introduced the $10,000 Voyager, its first """"transportable"""" work station, yesterday, will soon add the Sparc 5 and Sparc 20, work station models designed to refresh the performance of Sun's desktop systems and put the company back """"in the hunt"""" in the performance-sensitive work station market -- a market it created. Several weeks ago the company, based in Mountain View, Calif., treated analysts to a sneak preview of its new product family scheduled to be introduced later this month. Since then the buzz that the new products have created has begun turning some heads on Wall Street. The word is, there has never been a better time to buy Sun's stock, which had been languishing in the $20 range since the beginning of January. But the buzz has already prompted buying. Yesterday the stock closed at $29.875, up 50 cents. While the stock is still below its 1987 high of $45.75, it has risen 8 percent in the last five trading days. But trading all year has been volatile. The stock closed last year at $29.125. """"I don't always have kind things to say about Sun, but I do right now,"""" Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said. """"If you're going to buy Sun, this is the window."""" What Sun did wrong in the past was essentially fumble the transition between one generation of its Sparc microprocessor and the next, when its ally Texas Instruments took far too long to complete designing a crucial new chip. That could have been fatal, but during the period that Sun lagged in performance, none of its competitors could dislodge it from its 30 percent share of the work station market. """"Sun has been a company that is perceived to have lagged technically,"""" said Doug van Dorsten, a stock analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, """"but they still have the largest market share, so they're doing something right."""" That something, he said, was to develop systems that spoke directly to the needs of its core customers, who wanted to """"downsize"""" -- move critical applications off expensive mainframes into the Unix work station market. That, in turn, has protected the company's margins in the last year, because Sun's high-end server computers have sold better than the computer maker's internal projections. """"Any way you look at it, Sun is an inexpensive stock,"""" Mr. van Dorsten said. """"You could make a credible case that Sun should be valued as high as Hewlett Packard."""" Currently Hewlett Packard is selling at $90, three times Sun's price. In addition to getting higher marks from Wall Street analysts for getting its technology act together, Sun also has a solid business story. A number of analysts said that Sun had managed its business efficiently in the last year, holding its inventories significantly below both Hewlett Packard and Silicon Graphics. And the company recently restructured its distribution channels, cutting back from five or six to just two distributors, thereby halting price discounting and maintaining profit margins. """"To their credit, they've never been out of it,"""" said Jeffry Canin, a financial analyst at Salomon Brothers in San Francisco. """"It's quite astonishing that they've done as well as they have."
3/13/1994	The Executive Computer; Will New Power Macintosh Put Apple Back on Top?	APPLE COMPUTER will introduce the Power Macintosh tomorrow, and Mac lovers everywhere can breathe easy. Apple appears to have pulled off the most important product transition in its history without crashing. Nothing in Apple's history has made this a sure thing. The faithful could look back through the years at the debuts of the Newton, Lisa and Apple III, and find much to worry about. Even the introduction of the original Macintosh in January 1984 was less than an unqualified success: Apple rolled out a slow machine at a high price with little software and no compatibility with its core product at the time, the Apple II.
3/11/1994	Chip Makers' Competing Creeds	RISC or CISC? This seemingly esoteric computer industry debate, on which every techie will opine, has boiled over into a theological dispute that has turned Silicon into a Valley divided. Intel, whose chips are the dominant standard in personal computers, is high priest of a chip technology known as CISC. But Apple Computer, long computing's heretic, is converting to the RISC creed with the new generation of Macintosh computers it will introduce on Monday. Each approach has its technical merits, but customers and software developers must ultimately make a leap of faith.
3/4/1994	Apple's Newton Reborn: Will It Still the Critics?	"As consumer products go, it may be comparable to Ford's seeking a second chance for the Edsel. On Friday, Apple Computer will bring out an improved Newton. When the original $799 Newton Messagepad hand-held computer came out last summer, its attempts to recognize handwriting provided such fodder for """"Doonesbury"""" and Jay Leno that the ridicule all but drowned out the machine's cadre of supporters who quietly said, in effect, """"Give it time."
3/4/1994	Intel Will Accelerate Drive For Acceptance of New Chip	The Intel Corporation will accelerate its drive to make the personal computer market rapidly accept its new generation of chips with the introduction on Monday of two faster versions of its Pentium microprocessor. For Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, the strategy of pushing the market quickly toward Pentium chips serves to fend off growing competition on two fronts. Intel is under increasing pressure from makers of PC clones, like Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix, whose chips mimic the performance of Intel's 486 microprocessors, and a new chip architecture, the Power PC, developed by I.B.M., Motorola and Apple Computer. Later this month, Apple will begin selling the personal computers equipped with the Power PC chip.
2/27/1994	Forget Penmanship, Spelling. The Laptop Is Required Here.	"SPANISH class at the Suffield Academy was about to begin, and one of the students, Tucker Taffe, had a high-tech problem. His laptop computer, overloaded with too many games, was not working. """"You may open your computers now,"""" the class's teacher, Amparo Adib-Samii, said. """"Once you open Hyper Card, go to the verb exercise."""" Mrs. Adib-Samii has been a language teacher for 27 years at the private, coeducational secondary school."
2/11/1994	Home Video	"A new CD-ROM disk expands the idea of interactivity, with one man's recollections of a concentration camp and World War II. Interacting With History To many people, the much-ballyhooed term """"interactivity"""" suggests little more than rallying the reflexes to play video games."
2/11/1994	APPLE TO INTRODUCE SET-TOP DEVICE FOR INTERACTIVE TV	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would introduce a device next week for television sets that can order and receive so-called interactive TV services like movies on demand. Apple will demonstrate the system on Tuesday in Los Angeles, with a system by the Oracle Systems Corporation for storing and distributing movies over fiber optic lines. Oracle is developing software to control computers that will process orders for interactive services. Apple's set-top box and others being developed by the General Instrument Corporation and Scientific-Atlanta Inc. will turn those signals into television images.
2/10/1994	APPLE TO CUT PRICES ON MACINTOSH QUADRA LINE	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would cut the prices of its line of Macintosh Quadra personal computers by as much as 18 percent to spur sales of the machines just before the company introduces its next generation of personal computers. The company also said it would give mail-in cash rebates of $150 to customers in the United States who buy selected Quadra computers with certain Apple printers.
1/25/1994	Apple to Offer a Paging Plan for Newtons	In an effort to pick up sluggish sales of its Newton hand-held computer, Apple Computer said yesterday that it would begin offering the system with a paging service under a two-year lease program with Mobilecomm, a subsidiary of BellSouth that offers a nationwide paging system. Apple also said sales of the Newton were better than had been speculated. Gaston Bastiaens, vice president and general manager of Apple's Personal Interactive Electronics division, said the company had sold 80,000 machines through the end of 1993. He said that the number did not include those sold by Sharp, one of Apple's partners in the Newton Project.
1/21/1994	Apple's Earnings Plungs as Revenues Rise	In the midst of a delicate product transition involving its decade-old Macintosh line of computers, Apple Computer said today that its revenues increased 23 percent for the first quarter, but earnings fell 75 percent. After a big revamping in July, Apple has been struggling. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., has had difficulty differentiating its computers from the Intel-based systems that run Windows software developed by Microsoft. Apple plans to introduce new versions of its Macintosh products in March, based on a new microprocessor chip called the Power PC, as part of an alliance with the International Business Machines Corporation and Motorola Inc.
1/19/1994	Apple Loses Key Official To Motorola	Apple Computer Inc. is losing the executive in charge of its new line of computers whose success is crucial to the company's future. The executive, Randall Battat, 34, is leaving to join Motorola Inc., both companies announced yesterday.
1/18/1994	If Powermac Comes, What's a Mac User to Do?	AS Apple Computer Inc. prepares to mark the 10th anniversary of the Apple Macintosh this month, it is also getting ready to unveil the Mac's successor, a next-generation machine reportedly called the Powermac. If rumors of a March introduction prove true, a difficult decision awaits many Macintosh users. Should they take advantage of what are likely to be lower prices as Apple tries to clear out its inventory of existing Macintosh models? Or should they leap to the Powermac platform, which promises at least to double the processing power of today's fastest Macintoshes?
1/6/1994	I.B.M.-Apple Partnership Adds Hewlett	The Hewlett-Packard Company will announce today that it is joining Taligent Inc., an I.B.M.-Apple alliance to develop a new generation of computer operating software. Founded in 1992, Taligent is mainly an effort to prevent the Microsoft Corporation from ruling the market for powerful software used by corporations, as it already does in personal-computer software. Recently, some industry executives have doubted the commitment of I.B.M. andApple Computer, both suffering from financial strains, to the project.
1/5/1994	COMPANY NEWS; Citibank-Apple Card Offers Discount Toward Computers	Citibank and Apple Computer Inc. yesterday introduced joint Mastercards and Visa credit cards that provide rebates on Apple products to customers. Analysts said the venture, which links the nation's largest bank card issuer with the second-largest computer manufacturer, was intended by Citibank to regain a larger share of the market in the increasingly competitive credit card industry, and for Apple to increase sales.
1/3/1994	Apple to Introduce On-Line Computer Service	So popular did on-line services for personal computers become in 1993 that one leading computer maker has decided to begin 1994 by entering the on-line game. On Wednesday, Apple Computer Inc. will announce that it is introducing a new service, called E-World, that is intended to compete with established forces like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy.

1/2/1994	Profile; Reprogramming the Hacker Elite	"FIRST and only"""" is a familiar phrase to Donna Auguste. The first member of her family to graduate from college, she was also the first black woman to enter the Ph.D. program in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. And in her chosen field, one dominated by white males, she is a definite rarity. Until last month, she managed the elite team of programmers who helped create Apple Computer's Newton pen-based computer, and this month she starts work as a researcher at U S West's Boulder, Colo., advanced technology group developing multimedia technology for interactive cable television."
12/29/1993	Apple Details Severance	Apple Computer Inc., which gave its former chairman, John Sculley, a multimillion-dollar severance package, has outlined the packages it provided for two of his close aides. Apple agreed to pay Albert A. Eisenstat, the executive vice president and secretary, a $646,000 package next month as well as medical benefits, according to proxy materials for the annual meeting on Jan. 26. The agreement also allows him to exercise options immediately to buy Apple shares valued at $13.4 million.
12/15/1993	U.S. Concerns Split Over Japan Law	Several American computer companies are arguing in favor of a change in Japan's copyright law that the United States Government and many other American companies vigorously oppose. The break in the unified front of the American computer industry at a hearing here Monday could make it easier for Japan's Government to justify the revision of the law.
12/12/1993	Marketer's Dream, Engineer's Nightmare	JOHN SCULLEY, chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., traveled the world last year to preach about products he predicted would set his company apart from the rest of its industry. The star of his show was a palm-sized computer that would read handwritten notes jotted on its screen with a special pen, convert them to text, store them for future use, even transmit them wirelessly to other computers. More than that, the computer would anticipate its master's needs like a secretary -- for example, automatically entering into the machine's electronic datebook an appointment time transmitted from someone else. Dubbed the Newton, the new device would arrive, he promised, not in the 21st century but well in time for a place under the Christmas tree in a year or two.
12/10/1993	Market Place; How to play the new chip, PowerPC? Apple gets a vote.	"THE new chip jointly developed by I.B.M., Motorola and Apple, the PowerPC, is a tantalizing product for investors. It is being billed as """"twice the performance of Pentium, for half the price,"""" a market challenge to Intel's newest microprocessor for desktop computers. The slogan contains a measure of hyperbole, but computer and chip analysts agree that the new chip poses the first serious challenge to Intel's position as the industry standard."
12/8/1993	Computer Disk About Vietnam	"CBS, The New York Times Company and Apple Computer Inc. announced yesterday that they would jointly produce an """"interactive multimedia"""" encyclopedia of the Vietnam War. Material for the CD-ROM encyclopedia will be drawn from the archives and reporting of The New York Times and CBS News. The product will include a time line that will allow users to pick any date during the war and call up pictures and text on important events at that time in Vietnam and in the United States."
12/8/1993	Texas County Retreats Over Apple's Gay Policy	A Texas county beat a clear retreat today in its battle over Apple Computer's policy of granting health benefits to homosexual couples. Williamson County, eager to attract high-tech jobs, offered new tax breaks that the company quickly accepted, calling them equal to those the county commissioners turned down last week in protest of that policy. As he did last week, Commissioner David Hays provided the swing vote at a jammed meeting at the courthouse in Georgetown, the county seat. After arm-twisting by Gov. Ann W. Richards, who had lobbied to keep Apple from going to another state, Mr. Hays joined two other commissioners to approve nearly $1 million in tax incentives to Apple in return for the company's agreeing to build an office complex in this suburban county a few miles north of Austin. Apple said it planned a ground-breaking next spring on the $80 million customer support center.
12/8/1993	Nippon Seeks Alliances	The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation is discussing separately with the Microsoft Corporation and the Apple Computer Corporation possible alliances to explore new businesses, the president of the huge Japanese telephone phone company, Masashi Kojima, said today.
12/8/1993	Nippon Phone Seeks Alliances	"The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation is talking separately with the Microsoft Corporation and with the Apple Computer Corporation about possible alliances to explore new businesses, the president of the Japanese phone company said today. Masashi Kojima, N.T.T.'s president, said he had met with Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and Apple's president, Michael Spindler, and N.T.T. had formed working groups with each company to explore what he called """"quite exciting"""" opportunities that would combine computing and telecommunications."
12/7/1993	Give the Latest Fantasy In an Electronic Form	YOUR favorite computer users probably work all day on spreadsheets, data bases and other boring software, so it may be advisable to avoid business programs as holiday gifts, unless you are the type who gave Mom a new ironing board last year. By day they may enter data and process words, but by night they long to swash their buckles, defend Earth against alien invaders, pilot experimental aircraft and vaporize enemy tanks. Here are some recommendations for Apple Macintosh games and entertainment software. Games for Windows-based computers will be discussed later. Realistic Pinball Crystal Caliburn, the third title in a series called Solid State Pinball from the Japanese developer Little Wing, will be at the top of Silicon Santa's gift list this year. As did its predecessors, Tristan and Eight Ball Deluxe, Crystal Caliburn transforms the Macintosh screen into a pinball game, with the keyboard used to control the flippers and the plunger.
12/7/1993	Industry Group's Stand on Encoding	An industry group plans to tell the Clinton Administration that it is prepared to support the Administration's proposed method for scrambling phone calls and computer communications, but only if it is a voluntary standard and the Government is willing to drop strict export restrictions on other commercially available encoding technologies. The group, including some of the nation's largest computer makers and software publishers, plans to make its case today in a letter to President Clinton signed by 24 computer and telecommunications companies and organizations. The group includes Apple Computer, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Lotus Development, Microsoft, Oracle, Prodigy Services and Sun Microsystems.
12/5/1993	The Executive Computer; Another Move Toward Coexistence in the PC World	APPLE COMPUTER INC. is developing a new Macintosh that includes an Intel 486SX microprocessor, giving the computer the ability to run DOS and Windows software along with Macintosh software. One would think such a machine would create a stir because it represents something close to the Holy Grail of personal computing: a computer that runs all the popular programs, including DOS, Windows and Macintosh. It also represents the most tangible evidence yet of big changes at Apple under its new chief, Michael Spindler.
11/23/1993	Apple Lawsuit Ends in Accord	"Apple Computer Inc. said today that Albert A. Eisenstat, who quit its board and sued the company, had reached an agreement to settle the suit. The suit has been """"dismissed with prejudice,"""" the company said."
11/23/1993	Apple Going Into Home Marketing	Apple Computer Inc. will jump into the home-shopping market next month with a compact disk that contains text, sound and images from mail-order catalogue companies like Lands' End, Williams-Sonoma and Tiffany & Company. The disk, called En Passant, includes 21 catalogues from 18 retail companies as well as information on personal finance, video interviews and magazine articles.
11/14/1993	The Executive Computer; Another Drop-In Guest Could Crash a Big Event in Vegas	THE heavyweights of the personal computer industry are preparing once again to slug it out in Las Vegas, Nev., where the annual Comdex/Fall trade show opens tomorrow. The tone for this year's extravaganza was set earlier this month when a man in a powered parachute sailed down into the Las Vegas boxing ring where Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe were fighting for the heavyweight title. If there is a similar disruption this week, it will be the arrival of the Power PC chip. The chip is a new microprocessor forged by the alliance of International Business Machines, Apple Computer and Motorola. It could drop into the ring where the Intel Corporation -- the heavyweight champ for the past decade -- is beating the chips out of its many challengers.
11/9/1993	Of Zoomers, Newtons and Real Life: So Far, Promise Exceeds Usefulness	"WHEN the Newton Message Pad finally arrived a couple of months ago, Apple Computer Inc. was widely criticized for promising too much and delivering too little. Billed as a """"personal digital assistant,"""" the Newton was the first of what was expected to be a new generation of pocket computers that combined information management and communications. Now comes the Casio Z-7000 """"Zoomer,"""" which uses technology licensed from the maker of its fraternal twin, the Tandy Z-PDA, and one must conclude that these small, pen-based information managers are simply ahead of their time. Although the Zoomer appears to be marginally more useful than the Newton, at least for now, it, too, is most likely to appeal mainly to what Casio refers to as """"early adopters of innovative consumer electronics technology,"""" in other words, gadget buffs who do not mind spending $700 or more for a gizmo of unproven utility, and who are willing to endure some frustration in learning to use it. The suggested list price for the Casio device I tested was $899.95."
10/19/1993	Sculley to Head Small Networker	John Sculley, who resigned on Friday as chairman of Apple Computer Inc., confounded the computer and communications industries today by betting his grand vision of a digital-information future on a little-known wireless networking company. Mr. Sculley said he would become chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information Technologies Inc., a company based in Manhasset, L.I., that controls a series of crucial patents related to the wireless transmission of computer data.
10/16/1993	Visionary Apple Chairman Moves On	John Sculley brought an era to an end in Silicon Valley today by resigning from Apple Computer Inc., the innovative company he joined 10 years ago and built into a giant in the personal computer industry. Mr. Sculley, a former Pepisco Inc. executive, made his mark by bringing marketing skills and corporate discipline to Apple, a company founded in Steven P. Jobs's parents' garage. During Mr. Sculley's reign the company's sales grew tenfold, from $800 million a year to $8 billion, and he was credited with helping the industry push the personal computer beyond office desktops and into the homes and onto the laps of America.
10/15/1993	A Small Profit for Apple Computer	Apple Computer Inc. reported a steep drop in its fourth-quarter earnings and profit margins today, but it defied Wall Street's most pessimistic expectations by eking out a small profit and posting a substantial gain in sales. The results are a sign that Apple's strategy of slashing prices and cutting operating costs might still pay off. Analysts had been anticipating a small loss and far lower sales.
10/11/1993	Apple to Offer Disk Product	Apple Computer Inc. plans to announce on Monday that it will begin marketing software for Macintosh and Windows-based computers delivered on a CD-ROM disk. The new system will allow personal computer users to try demonstration programs on their systems, then call an 800 number and receive a numeric unlocking key upon purchase of the application.
10/4/1993	Apple Business System	In one of the first indications that Apple Computer Inc. is moving in the direction of separating its software and hardware businesses, the company is planning to introduce an advanced version of its System 7 operating system Monday that will include features for corporate and small-business users. The new version, called System 7 Pro, will add functions to the standard Macintosh software, including built-in electronic mail that permits users to send messages that include animation, graphics and sound. System 7 Pro is priced at $149.
10/1/1993	A Search for Direction at Apple	Perhaps the clearest indicator of the change and uncertainty at Apple Computer Inc. lately is the way Bill Fernandez, the software engineer who became the company's first employee in 1976, spends his time these days. He reads the Help Wanted ads in the newspaper. Mr. Fernandez is among the 2,500 people Apple has laid off since July, when the company reported a $188.3 million third-quarter loss and announced a reorganization intended to reverse its plummeting value in the stock market.

9/25/1993	Apple Executive Is Let Go and Sues	The Apple Computer executive and board member who handled the Apple-Microsoft suit was laid off Thursday and immediately resigned from the board and sued Apple over his severance. The departure of Albert A. Eisenstat, a 13-year employee who was the company's executive vice president and in charge of its legal affairs, is the most recent of several executive departures at Apple.
9/21/1993	COMPANY NEWS: Big Mac Attack; Intel's Ads Take Aim At Apple Enthusiasts	If the Intel Corporation cannot be in your computer, it will at least be in your face. This week, Intel takes its long-running Intel Inside advertising campaign promoting its microprocessor to the pages of MacUser, MacWeek and MacWorld, magazines for users of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, the only major personal computer that is not designed around Intel's chips.
9/19/1993	Technology; The Tools of a New Art Form	"When the photographer Rick Smolan decided to create a multimedia version of """"From Alice to Ocean,"""" his coffee-table book about a young woman's walk across the Australian desert with four camels, he had rich material to work with: his own photographs and narration by the woman, Robyn Davidson, reading from her own best seller on the trip, """"Tracks."""" To these Mr. Smolan added short video clips on Australian cultures, animal life and his photographic techniques. The challenge was to put it all together in an interactive form that could be viewed on a personal computer with a CD-ROM player and allow the user either to sit back and let the story unfold or use a mouse to select annotated side trips, like a photo essay on life in an aboriginal village. Mr. Smolan said the project may not have been possible without a software tool called Director, produced by Macromedia, a San Francisco company whose multimedia development software has become a de facto standard. Director enables multimedia producers to link text, video, graphics, animation and sound, without writing the many lines of software code that such an undertaking might otherwise require."
9/15/1993	Shifting Burdens: Business and the Health Plan - A special report.; Companies Big and Small Tally Effects of Clinton Health Plan	President Clinton's plan for reshaping the health care system would cause a vast shift in financial burdens among American corporations. Health costs would ease for companies, most of them manufacturers, that now offer generous benefits, and rise for those that do not, among them not only small neighborhood shops but also corporate giants like Wal-Mart, Sears and Wendy's. How those burdens would be reapportioned emerges from a look at insurance costs and prospects at four companies representing the variety of corporate experiences: Ford Motor Company, an older manufacturer; Apple Computer, a young high-tech company; Lehigh Valley Racquet and Fitness Centers, a small Pennsylvania business that uses part-time instructors, and Manpower Inc., the nation's biggest supplier of temporary workers.
9/8/1993	Apple Introduces a Multimedia Kit for Use on Rivals' PC's	Apple Computer Inc. announced three new multimedia kits for personal computers, including the first for non-Apple PC's. While the Apple Macintosh and Performa series computers introduced a year ago have come with options that include a CD-ROM drive and speakers for multimedia performance, Apple previously shied away from offering any product that connected with a nonproprietary product.
8/17/1993	Apple Offers Teachers An Extra-Value Deal	"STUDENTS aren't the only ones looking for back-to-school computers. Judging from the mailbag, many teachers and school administrators are also shopping, or at least yearning, for computers of their own to use at home and in the classroom. By far the most interest seems to be in Apple Macintosh computers, which are traditionally more popular in schools than they are in the business world. Apple deserves an """"A"""" for its recent introduction of an excellent new classroom computer, the LC 520, perhaps the best value in the entire Macintosh product line. It also deserves extra credit for allowing elementary and secondary teachers to buy new Macintosh equipment for personal use at a discount. But Apple also deserves a """"D"""" -- for disappointment -- because the new LC 520 is not sold to the public. Only schools can buy it."
8/10/1993	Motorola Said to Buy Right To New Microsoft Software	Motorola Inc. has reportedly bought the rights to use the Microsoft Corporation's new operating system software, Windows NT, with Motorola's Power PC line of microprocessors. The Power PC chip, developed jointly by Motorola, the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc., is aimed at breaking the near-monopoly of the Intel Corporation in supplying the central chip in personal computers.
8/8/1993	The Executive Computer; With New Machines, Apple Keeps Its Edge in Multimedia	MOST of the attention at last week's Macworld computer trade show was focused on a little green Apple, a handheld unit called the Newton. But Apple Computer Inc. also decided the time was ripe to introduce its most powerful Macintoshes to date. The new Macintosh Quadra 840AV and its smaller sibling, the Centris 650AV, are the first of what Apple says will be many computers using AV -- audio-visual -- technologies.
8/5/1993	APPLE DIRECTOR QUITS OVER POTENTIAL CONFLICT ON INTEL	"Venture capitalist Arthur Rock, citing a potential conflict of interest, resigned yesterday from the board of Apple Computer Inc. Mr. Rock, a founder and board member of the Intel Corporation, said the new """"perception of competition"""" between the two companies made it impossible for him to remain as a director of both. Mr. Rock pointed to advertising and news coverage that pits the PowerPC, a microprocessor developed by Motorola Inc., I.B.M. and Apple, against Intel's new Pentium chip."
7/31/1993	MESSAGE RECEIVER FOR APPLE COMPUTER INTRODUCED	"Motorola Inc. has introduced a credit card-sized message receiver for Apple Computer Inc.'s new Newton personal communicator. The three-ounce Newton Messaging Card will permit users to receive wireless messages, data and news services via an unspecified nationwide paging service, the company said. The price of the card, which uses the PCMCIA format, has not been announced. Apple is negotiating with the Mobil Telecommunication Technologies Corporation for the cards' use in its Skytel message service, but Skytel's spokesman, David Alan, said, """"There isn't an agreement yet""""."
7/30/1993	Stakes High in Apple's Bet on PC	In high-tech country this week, the favorite topic around the water coolers and Stairmasters is whether Apple Computer Inc. has a hit product or a flop in its hand-held Newton Messagepad computer. First announced 17 months ago, with its debut set for a computer trade show in Boston on Monday, the Newton has generated a flurry of opinions on whether Apple has produced the next equivalent of the cellular phone for mobile workers. The machine, which fits in the palm of the hand, is designed to read handwriting, serve as a digital appointment book and use radio waves to send and receive faxes and electronic mail.
7/27/1993	APPLE SHIPS LOWER-PRICED FILE SERVERS	Apple Computer Inc. shipped two more models of the network server line that it introduced last quarter. The new machines -- the Workgroup Server 60 and 80 -- cost $2,949 to $3,899 and $5,489 to $9,049, respectively, less than Apple's first two servers, the Workgroup Server 95 machines, which cost $7,598 and $12,989. File servers are computers that store files and programs used by all computers on a network. Apple sold no servers of its own until the Workgroup line.
7/21/1993	Market Place; When It Comes to High Tech, the Valley Says the Street Is Myopic.	SOMETIMES it seems like the technology wizards of Silicon Valley and the investors of Wall Street live on different planets. The Valley's refrain is that the Street doesn't see past the latest quarter and frequently misses the reality of high technology: Spending on product development generally pays off many quarters down the road.
7/17/1993	Apple Stock Is Hammered For 23% Loss	Shaken investors wiped out nearly a quarter of the value of Apple Computer's shares yesterday, a day after the troubled personal computer maker announced its largest quarterly loss ever and an expensive restructuring plan. Apple shares plummeted $8.25, or 23 percent, closing at $27.50 in Nasdaq trading on volume of almost 19 million shares. Other technology stocks also fell, dragging down the stock markets. [ Page 36. ]
7/16/1993	Big Loss and Big Revamping at Apple	The extent of Apple Computer's troubles became more fully evident today. The company announced a much bigger quarterly loss than had been expected and a big restructuring, even as it began laying off employees at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.
7/13/1993	Apple Cuts Prices Again To Aid Sales	In an effort to revive sluggish sales and make its computers more attractive to mainstream business buyers, Apple Computer Inc. cut prices today on many of its portables, desktops and departmental computers. The new round of price reductions is the third in three months.
7/11/1993	Sound Bytes; Wooing the Suits and Ties On Behalf of PowerPC	"HIS business card lists his official title as """"Lord of the High End,"""" but Frank Casanova of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh division is really """"Lover of All Things Fast."""" """"Fast cars, fast computers, fast food,"""" he said, listing a few of his favorite things. Mr. Casanova came to Apple, where he has been a product manager for the Macintosh IIfx and Quadra computers, from Apollo Computer Inc., where he worked on high-performance work stations."
7/9/1993	It's Batten-Down, Button-Down Time at Apple	The era of Silicon Valley's Magic Kingdom may finally be drawing to a close. Apple Computer Inc. has long been revered as a special company, successfully violating many norms of corporate behavior with its blue jeans and T-shirts culture. But the new chief executive, Michael Spindler, has sent what some consider his first clear signal that the new Apple will increasingly fit the Corporate America mold rather than break it.
7/7/1993	Apple Cutting Its Work Force 16% Worldwide	Under deepening pressure from its personal computer rivals, Apple Computer Inc. confirmed today that it would restructure its operations and slice its work force by 16 percent, or about 2,500 employees worldwide. The company also said it would take an unspecified charge against its third-quarter earnings, due to be announced next week. Some analysts predict the charge may be as high as $300 million and will result in a loss for the period.
6/30/1993	APPLE INTRODUCES I.B.M.-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS	"Apple Computer Inc., increasingly merging its operating world with that of I.B.M.-compatible computers, introduced two products yesterday that help its machines talk to I.B.M.-based systems. Apple said the first product, now being shipped, would also be sold by the International Business Machines Corporation. The SNA.ps 5250 software package was developed under the Apple/I.B.M. Enterprising Network Initiative. It allows users of Apple's Macintosh computers to work with applications on I.B.M.'s AS/400 family of midrange computers. Apple also introduced the Newton Connection Kit, which enables data to flow between a Newton device and a personal computer or a Macintosh computer. Newton, Apple's long-delayed hand-held """"personal digital assistant,"""" is scheduled to come to market in August."
6/29/1993	Better Color for Diehard Mac Users	AIRPLANE cabins are wonderful places to flaunt new portable computers. As thousands of computer buyers and sellers fly into New York this week for the PC Expo trade show, which opens today, more than a few will be flaunting their brand-new Apple Powerbook 180c's. The 180c is the flagship of Apple Computer Inc.'s Powerbook fleet, the first Powerbook to employ an active matrix color display. Active matrix is a flat-panel technology that produces images almost as bright and sharp as those on a desktop video monitor.
6/23/1993	Notebooks May Hold Key to I.B.M.'s Revival	"When I.B.M. brought Bruce Claflin back from Tokyo last year to manage the company's notebook computer unit, he was elated. The 40-year-old marketing executive had been given his own business to run. Then reality set in. """"It took me about a month to understand how deep a hole the business was in,"""" Mr. Claflin recalled. """"I don't think you could get it any worse than it was."
6/23/1993	Duties Ended On Computer Flat Screens	Caught in the awkward position of fostering one high-technology industry at the expense of another, the Commerce Department has revoked import duties on advanced screens that are used in laptop computers and other equipment. In its decision, announced late Monday, the department brushed aside the protests of a handful of fledgling American companies, which argued that the duties were crucial to developing a domestic advanced-screen industry. Flat-panel displays that are capable of producing vivid colors and detailed images are central components in notebook computers and are expected to be used heavily in high-definition television systems.
6/21/1993	Apple Computer, Faltering, Strives to Refocus	Apple Computer's horizon is rich with crystalline visions of hand-held gadgets that are smart enough to read handwriting, machines that recognize speech, work stations with the power of supercomputers and boxes atop televisions that would transform the sets into computers. But in the here and now, Apple suddenly seems to have lost its focus. With sales from its future products at least months if not years away, the company has seen market share and profit margins shrink for its line of personal computers. And the company, which in the hard times of the past had slashed its work force, might be on the verge of layoffs again.
6/19/1993	Sculley Gives Up One Post At Apple	The chairman of Apple Computer Inc. said today that he would relinquish his role as chief executive to pursue alliances involving new computer-based technologies. John Sculley, 54, who came to Apple 10 years ago from Pepsico, will retain the title of chairman and hand over the chief executive's job to Apple's president, Michael Spindler.
6/18/1993	NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE LOOKS AT JOINT EFFORTS	"Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's main telephone company, is discussing possible cooperation in multimedia technology and communications with Apple Computer Inc. and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, a spokesman said yesterday. """"Many things are being studied,"""" the spokesman, Kenya Nakatsuka, said, including a possible investment in General Magic, a Silicon Valley company that is developing technology for personal communicators, which are hand-held devices that transmit messages by phone or radio wave. Apple and A.T.& T. are also interested in N.T.T.'s help in assuring that Japan has communications networks that can be used by personal communicators and for transmission of video signals."
6/11/1993	Top Effie Prize Goes To Apple Campaign	Advertising awards for effectiveness and creativity were presented last night in New York. Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., and BBDO Los Angeles shared the top prize in the 25th Annual Effie Awards, given by the New York chapter of the American Marketing Association in recognition of effectiveness in advertising. The two won the Grand Effie for a campaign that introduced Apple's popular Power Book laptop computer, which in four months grew to account for 20 percent of all sales of portable computers. In addition, they shared a Gold Effie in the computer category.
6/10/1993	Apple Says Its Profits Will Drop	The personal computer price war has wounded another company: Apple Computer Inc., which was once thought to be above the fray because its easy-to-use machines had no direct competitor. The value of Apple's stock plummeted by 10.6 percent today, after the company predicted that its earnings would fall because price-cutting had eroded the company's profit margins. The plunge followed declines in the two previous days of trading, meaning that Apple's shares have lost more than 19 percent of their market value this week.
6/8/1993	APPLE COMPUTER SHARES DECLINE ON ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES	Shares of the Apple Computer Corporation declined more than $4 yesterday after a Dean Witter analyst, Eugene Glazer, cut his estimates for the company's earnings. Mr. Glazer wrote in a report that there was a risk Apple would not meet third-quarter revenue expectations and that the computer manufacturer might have to cut prices to raise revenue. Mr. Glazer also cut his estimates for the third quarter ending June 30 to 89 cents a share from $1.04 and slashed his 1993 estimate to $4 from $4.30. For the comparable period a year ago, Apple's net income was $530.4 million, or $4.33 a share.
6/2/1993	Judge Finds Against Apple in Its Copyright Suit	Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker said today that he would grant summary judgment in favor of the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company on the last significant issue remaining in the five-year-long copyright infringement suit brought against the two companies by Apple Computer Inc. Judge Walker's formal ruling will be filed within several days. Apple, which had said last week that it would not contest the ruling, said today that it would appeal the case on grounds others than those decided in the summary judgment. Wall Street Approves Although the case could drag on through the appellate level for years, Wall Street greeted its close at the district level as a positive. Microsoft shares rose $3.625, to $96.25, in Nasdaq trading; Hewlett-Packard closed up $2.25, to $85.625, on the New York Stock Exchange, and Apple gained 37.5 cents, to $57, on the Nasdaq.
5/29/1993	No Jury Trial in Apple Suit	The jury trial scheduled for June 28 in the long-running copyright infringement suit by Apple Computer Inc. against the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company has been removed from the court calendar with the approval of the three companies. A pretrial hearing scheduled for Tuesday by Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker will still take place, and the case could still proceed to an appeal after the judge's has ruled.
5/27/1993	Apple Aims for Ex-Soviet States	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would begin a new effort to compete head-on with the International Business Machines Corporation in Russia and the other former Soviet republics. The lifting of cold war restrictions on exports of technology to the former Soviet Union has provided Apple and other personal computer companies with a potentially enormous market.
5/25/1993	School Computers Emulate Games To Capture the Attention of Pupils	A NEW wave of innovative computer programs and interactive devices is about to hit the nation's schools, driven by a national desire to address education problems, rapidly falling prices of computer and video technology, and the keenness of software companies to invade the vast educational market. Representatives from Sega and Nintendo, the computer games companies, joined Apple, Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics and luminaries from government and education at a conference convened in Washington this month by the National Academy of Sciences. Their purpose was to explore how the bright new technologies of computer entertainment and communication might be harnessed to enliven the nation's classrooms.
5/25/1993	Japanese Joining Computer Display Venture	Kaleida Labs, a joint venture of Apple Computer and I.B.M., announced here today that three Japanese electronics giants had joined its quest to create a standard for computers that can display video images and reproduce music and voices. Hitachi Ltd., the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation -- along with Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation -- have become charter members of an alliance to use Script X, Kaleida's computer language for the creation and playback of multimedia programs. Also joining is Creative Technology Ltd. a Singapore company known for its Sound Blaster circuit board that allows personal computers to reproduce sounds. Opportunity for Growth Script X is being advanced as a standard for multimedia computers and consumer devices, particularly those that store programs on CD-ROM's, variations of the audio compact disk. But many leading companies have not yet signed up to use Script X.
5/25/1993	Market Place; Adobe's New Acrobat Software Could Prove to Be a Winner	ADOBE SYSTEMS INC. is dramatically silencing its doubters. The creator of the software technology called Postscript, which has enabled high-quality printing in the personal computer market, recently fought off a substantial challenge from Microsoft and Apple Computer to keep its role as industry standard-setter. Now it is preparing to ship a new software technology for electronic documents that many industry experts believe will be an even bigger win than Postscript.
5/23/1993	TV Without Film or Tape	THE pace may be quickening, but the adoption of new technology for capturing video journalists' work is a time-honored tradition. In the mid-1970's, for instance, the cinematographer James Wong Howe became captivated with videotape, then a relatively new technology. Because each reel of one-inch videotape held only four minutes of material -- he had his assistant, Scott Billups, follow him with a cart holding a 120-pound video recorder and spare reels during filming.
5/23/1993	In Pursuit of Computing's Holy Grail	"AT FIRST, the names on the conference rooms seem merely quirky: Dumbarton, York and Edinburgh. Maybe the boss got carried away after a summer vacation to Britain. But walk along the tree-lined atrium, up a flight of stairs to the larger meeting rooms, and the clues on the doors get stronger: The Gorge, The Evil Lair. The names are from Arthurian legend. And the 300 designers here from the International Business Machines Corporation, Motorola Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. who are trying to transform the computer-chip business have named their building and their make-or-break program """"Somerset"""" -- after the English county where, according to legend, the knights of the Round Table gathered at King Arthur's castle, put aside their differences and set off in pursuit of the Holy Grail. """"It seemed appropriate for what's going on here,"""" explained Bill Goins, an Apple designer."
5/20/1993	APPLE COMPUTER COPYRIGHT CASE IS NARROWED	A judge has further narrowed the scope of the five-year-old Apple Computer copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. Tuesday's ruling by Federal District Judge Vaughn R. Walker means that a jury will now consider only 4 of the 147 software features that Apple originally contended had been copied by Hewlett-Packard, and none of the 189 specific Microsoft features that Apple had originally challenged. The judge set a June 28 trial date for the case, which had already been substantially reduced. Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have contended that many of the contested symbols are generic or were derived from icons used earlier by other companies.
5/18/1993	Speed and Clarity at a Low Cost	"APPLE COMPUTER INC. has revamped its family of printers in recent months, including several new laser models. But the really hot news is at the bottom end of the line, where Apple has significantly improved its low-cost Stylewriter for the Macintosh. """"The new Canon printer engine they use is much faster, and it has great print quality,"""" said Charles LeCompte, editor of the Hard Copy Observer, a newsletter that covers the printer industry. """"People who have a Stylewriter will notice a big improvement."
5/18/1993	Being Superintegrated	IT has been said, no doubt by an Apple partisan, that Microsoft Windows makes a PC almost as good as a Macintosh. Well, Clarisworks for Windows makes a PC almost as good as a Macintosh running Clarisworks. Claris of Santa Clara, Calif., is the software subsidiary of Apple Computer Inc. But getting in bed with the enemy has always been a popular choice, especially one as well-armed as the Microsoft Corporation.
5/11/1993	New Apple Chip in Challenge to Intel	Sounding a direct challenge to the Intel Corporation's chips, Apple Computer's chairman, John Sculley, predicted today that in 1994 Apple would sell more than a million of a new generation of personal computers based on a chip Apple has developed in an alliance with I.B.M. and Motorola. Mr. Sculley said the company was on schedule with development of a new generation of personal computer, to be introduced next year and based on the Power PC chip. The technology is derived from the microprocessor used in the International Business Machines Corporation's powerful RS/6000 work stations.
5/9/1993	The Executive Computer; Do Apple's Compromises Make Business Sense?	Apple Computer Inc. has introduced a family of powerful Macs under the name Centris, trying to close the gap between its Macintosh computers and the more popular and cheaper Windows-based personal computers. Compared with previous Macintoshes, the Centris models 610 and 650 offer impressive power at surprisingly low prices. But the lower prices were achieved in part by jettisoning features that are important for many business uses, especially in the case of the 610.
4/27/1993	New PC Chip Is Shipped By Motorola	Motorola Inc. said today that it had begun shipping samples of the Power PC microprocessor. The chip, jointly developed with I.B.M. and Apple Computer, is meant to compete with Intel's new Pentium chip as the standard for the next generation of personal computers. Motorola said the Power PC chips, expected to appear in an Apple desktop computer by early next year, would be priced much lower than analysts had expected and at about half the price the Intel Corporation is expected to charge for the Pentium, which is not as powerful as the Power PC.
4/25/1993	Where the Cubicle Is Dead	APPLE COMPUTER INC. had a problem: Its computer designers wouldn't come to work. Unable to concentrate in the typical modern office -- small cubicles in large, wide-open rooms -- many simply stayed home to do technical work. But this improvisation wouldn't do. The best ideas, Apple executives realized, are nurtured when there's a feeling of community, when engineers can toss suggestions around at the water cooler. Such suggestions become products. And in the computer business, an extra month or two in a product's development can cost millions of dollars or mean the loss of a market edge.
4/21/1993	Apple Computer Will Open Sales Operation in Mexico	"Affirming its commitment to the personal computing market in Mexico, Apple Computer Inc. said today that it was opening Apple Computer Mexico. The new marketing and distribution development office will provide local sales, marketing, service and support to Apple's resellers, third-party software developers and partners in Mexico. """"The Mexican marketplace offers tremendous growth opportunities for both Apple and our partners,"""" John Floisand, the president of Apple Pacific, said in a statement. """"We're convinced we'll be able to build a strong infrastructure in Mexico capable of addressing customer needs in all market sectors."""" Apple Computer Mexico is part of Apple Latin America, which is one of five regions that make up Apple Pacific."
4/19/1993	Market Place	AFTER Apple Computer Inc. announced a decline in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, analysts rushed to revise their estimates for the year. Some revised them downward, as one might expect, but some raised their estimates and others even issued new buy recommendations. Apple shares closed up 87.5 cents, at $48.125, when trading ended on Friday. Analysts at Bear, Stearns; S. G. Warburg; Salomon and Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded their investment ratings. Lehman Brothers and First Boston maintained buy ratings, while analysts at Hambrecht & Quist; Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs were negative.
4/17/1993	Lower Earnings Fail to Halt Apple's Stock Price	Shares of Apple Computer Inc. rose today even though the company reported lower quarterly profits because of price cuts and costly product introductions. Apple shares rose 87.5 cents, to $48.125, in Nasdaq trading. The company reported results for its second quarter late on Thursday.
4/6/1993	APPLE COMPUTER UPGRADES ITS SERVICE OPTIONS	Apple Computer Inc. upgraded its service options, including extending warranties on its entire line of personal computers and peripherals. Apple also said three of the nation's largest distributors, Ingram Micro Inc., Merisel Inc. and the Tech Data Corporation, would recruit other dealers to become authorized dealers of Apple peripherals.
3/31/1993	APPLE COMPUTER ESTABLISHES MULTIMEDIA UNIT	Apple Computer Inc. has formed a division to expand its forays into multimedia computing. Apple, of Cupertino, Calif., first built microphones into its Macintosh personal computers 10 years ago and added video and CD-ROM options throughout its product line during the last 18 months.
3/25/1993	In a Shift, Apple Licenses a System	Apple Computer Inc. announced several new licensees today for its Newton hand-held computing system and indicated that it planned to share the technology even more widely. The move is a significant shift by the computer maker, which has a tradition of fiercely protecting its Macintosh and Apple II computers from imitators.
3/22/1993	Apple Offers New System For Desktops	"In a shift that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, Apple Computer Inc. will introduce on Monday a line of multi-user computers designed to make the company's desktop systems more appetizing for corporate buyers. The new computer family, which features three """"server"""" computers to store and retrieve data for networks of desktop machines, is a sharp contrast to the """"one worker, one computer"""" credo on which Apple has stood since it was founded in the mid-1970's."
3/14/1993	The Executive Life; A Gadget With Status Written All Over It	"IN the land of the big screen, the latest sensation is the littlest screen: a featherweight """"notebook"""" computer -- Apple's Powerbook, if possible -- for showing off one's business savvy, job dedication and techno-knowhow, or just for showing off. """"It's another gadget,"""" said Melissa Bachrach, executive vice president at Michael Jackson's Nation Films, """"to make us into 'better' executives."
3/12/1993	APPLE WILL GET SOME HELP FROM SIEMENS	Apple Computer Inc., which failed to deliver its highly touted Newton Notepad last year, has recruited Siemens A.G., Europe's biggest electronics company, to help jump-start the product, which combines telecommunications and computing. Siemens and Apple will show a product concept called Notephone at the Hanover CeBit trade show on March 25, a Siemens official said yesterday.
3/9/1993	Aids Kit for Powerbook	APPLE COMPUTER INC. is selling Powerbook portable Macintosh computers at a rate of more than a million a year, which is a remarkable pace for a computer that is mostly incompatible with 90 percent of the other PC's in the world. As might be expected from those who march to the beat of a different drummer, or at least to the code of a different operating system, people who tote Powerbooks seem to take a particular pride in fine-tuning their machines. One way to jazz up the Powerbook is to load it with the Norton Essentials for Powerbook, a $129 package produced by the Symantec Corporation of Cupertino, Calif.
3/7/1993	The Executive Computer; Owners Love the Powerbook, but Also Have Complaints	"THE scene would alarm the owner of any portable computer. The technician at the local computer store looked at the tiny new Express modem from Apple Computer Inc. that he was preparing to install in a Mac Powerbook Duo and said: """"I've never done one of these before. The tech over at the Berkeley store said his first one took him three-and-a-half hours."""" Apple's new high-speed modem-on-a-chip is several months late to market, and expensive and difficult to install. It also serves as an effective illustration of the refinements needed in the Powerbook, which has become not just the nation's most popular laptop computer but also the best-selling computer of all time."
3/7/1993	The Executive Life; Democrat Days In Silicon Valley	WHEN President Clinton sat down for dinner with Silicon Valley chief executives recently at the California Cafe in Los Gatos, sitting on one side of him was John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer. That wasn't surprising. But on the other side of the President sat Regis McKenna, head of a locally based marketing firm. Although Mr. McKenna is a well-known figure in tech circles, his placement next to the new President was notable. So was the seating of David J. Barram, Apple's vice president of worldwide affairs and public policies, next to Vice President Gore at a nearby table.
3/7/1993	Sound Bytes; Becoming Washington's Policy Wonk on Technology	John Sculley's personal odyssey is continuing. The former president of Pepsico was once sarcastically asked by Steven P. Jobs whether he wanted to spend his life as a sugar water salesman. Since then he has made the transition to Apple Computer's chief technology officer and now is on the brink of becoming what President Clinton affectionately referred to as a Washington technology policy wonk. Mr. Sculley was prominently seated next to Hillary Rodham Clinton when the President presented his economic package before Congress last month. A week later, when President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited Silicon Valley to introduce the President's high technology program, they dined as Mr. Sculley's guests in Los Gatos, Calif.
2/16/1993	Book-Disk Combinations for the Mac	"COMPUTER books are often packaged with software disks, making it difficult to decide which is the dog and which is the tail. There is no doubt with """"Big Mac Secrets,"""" by Mark Bilbo and Ken Maki (Que; $39.95). Even a five-megabyte tail (the amount of software on the disks) would have a hard time wagging a 1,249-page dog. This heavy volume covers it all: buying, customizing and upgrading hardware and software; troubleshooting; networking, and using the accompanying software. Two of the programs, Masterjuggler and Diskflash, are versions of commercial offerings. The six other major programs and a bunch of little ones are shareware; you try them out and, if you like them, you are honor bound to pay a registration fee, usually small."
2/9/1993	A.T.& T. Deal on General Magic Disclosed	Even as A.T.& T., Sony, Apple Computer and three other companies were formally announcing their alliance known as General Magic yesterday, an unannounced facet of the deal was stirring the first hints of controversy. The alliance, as expected, is to develop devices, computer programs and special networks that would carry data like electronic mail and may someday lead to portable Jetsonian devices that also carry voice and video.
2/9/1993	Apple Computer to Roll Out Six New Macintosh Models	In its third big announcement of new products in the last six months, Apple Computer Inc. will introduce six Macintosh computers and two laser printers Tuesday at the MacWorld Expo in Tokyo. The new machines are all intended to offer higher performance at lower prices than existing Macintosh models, reflecting Apple's resolve to increase its share of the personal computer market. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said the new machines would be available immediately in the United States, although, as with past Apple product introductions, high demand may cause a backlog for certain models.
1/17/1993	The Executive Computer; New Apple Printers Are Not for the Timid Buyer	Apple Computer Inc. earlier this month introduced its first color printer, an inkjet, and its first high-resolution laser printers -- and broke some ground on the price front as well. Several companies have already introduced color printers using the same engine Apple is using, and several others have laser printers capable of printing 600 dots per inch, compared with the 300 d.p.i. of the first-generation lasers. Nonetheless, the Apple printers are significant because they mark a push into potentially lucrative areas where Apple has lagged -- color printing and corporate networks -- and, in the case of the lasers, they bring Apple into line on the price front, where others have tended to lead the way down.
1/15/1993	Record Sales For Microsoft And Apple	Apple Computer Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation, two of the computer industry's hottest rivals, today announced record revenues for their first and second quarters, respectively. But neither company was able to show the earnings strength that sent technology stocks up on Wednesday in the wake of the Intel Corporation's strong fourth-quarter report.
1/15/1993	General Magic to Disclose Its Strategy and Sponsors	One of Silicon Valley's most closely watched start-ups will introduce its corporate sponsors and some of its strategy at a New York City news conference on Feb. 8, perhaps shedding some light on just where Apple Computer Inc. is heading as it tries to extend personal computing into growth areas involving portable electronic gadgets. Many computer companies are trying to build these gadgets, and to what extent Apple is determined to lead and to what extent it will work with General Magic, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that it helped found in 1990, is unclear.
1/13/1993	Apple Names Chief of Unit For Software	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had named David C. Nagel to lead its Macintosh Software Architecture division, succeeding Roger Heinen, who left last week to join the Microsoft Corporation. Mr. Nagel, a former NASA scientist, most recently was Apple's senior vice president for the advanced technology group.
1/9/1993	Apple's Share Price Climbs Sharply	Shares in Apple Computer Inc. soared today after a senior executive was quoted as saying that the company's revenue and unit shipments grew significantly in its first quarter, which ended Dec. 31. Apple also demonstrated the first working prototype of its Newton family of personal digital assistant, a handheld portable computer, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., today.
1/6/1993	New Keypad For Apple PC Is Adjustable	Apple Computer on Wednesday will become the first large computer maker to introduce a computer keyboard designed to reduce hand injuries from typing. But in doing so, the personal computer maker is touching off disputes over whether its keyboard will actually solve the hand problems it is designed to ease and whether the product copies patented technology developed by a small Silicon Valley inventor. Adjusting the Angle The Apple Adjustable Keyboard can be split into two pieces to permit a typist to hold his or her wrists in a more natural position. The keyboard lets the user spread the left- and right-hand sections up to a 30-degree angle to find the most comfortable typing position. It also includes a palm rest, similar to the ledge introduced recently on the company's Powerbook portable computers.
12/29/1992	A 2-Way Street for Sharing Data Between Macs and I.B.M.'s	"EXCHANGING files between two computers in a home office or small business is sometimes easiest via the """"sneaker net,"""" making a copy of a file on a floppy disk in one machine and walking over to put the floppy into the other one. You would not want to run a multinational corporation that way, but when the other computer is in the same room, or just down the hall, it is a quick and dirty solution. Physically linking the computers is more elegant, but not everyone wants to set up a network, even a little one. Another route is a hardware-software combination like Laplink, a popular and effective way to share files."
12/20/1992	Blue Point Residents Opposing Plan For a Drug Rehabilitation Center	"A PROPOSAL by a drug rehabilitation organization for a residential center in Blue Point has angered residents there. Although the organization, Apple Inc., operates 15 rehabilitation centers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the one in Blue Point would be the first for a category called on mentally ill chemical abusers on Long Island. """"We're hoping that like other communities we've dealt with, the people of Blue Point will overcome their fear of the unknown,"""" a spokesman for Apple, Mark Howard, said."
12/7/1992	Computer Agreement	Apple Computer Inc. and America Online Inc., a supplier of electronic information services based in Vienna, Va., have announced that Apple will manage and market services developed by America Online. The two companies also announced on Friday that they planned to work together to develop enhancements to America Online.
11/19/1992	APPLE LIFTS PLAN TO BUY BACK SHARES TO 9.6% FROM 1.2%	Apple Computer Inc.'s board cleared the Cupertino, Calif., personal-computer maker to add 10 million shares to its stock-buyback plan. The move lifts the buyback to 9.6 percent, or 11.4 million shares, from 1.2 percent, or 1.4 million shares. The 1.4 million shares remain from a previous authorization, Apple said yesterday. At its Sept. 25 fiscal year-end, Apple had 118.5 million shares outstanding. Based on yesterday's closing price of $57.75, up $2.50, in national over-the-counter trading, the total buyback is valued at $658.4 million. The buybacks are intended to offset the impact of shares issued for stock options that are exercised and for employee share plans, a spokesman said.
11/15/1992	Beyond the PC: Apple's Promised Land	JOHN SCULLEY wants to become the apostle of the information age. From Japan to Hollywood to Germany, the chairman of Apple Computer Inc. has been preaching about a post-industrial promised land where four giant industries -- computers, consumer electronics, communications and information -- will converge. Picture an affordable electronic personal assistant that fits in your hand and works anywhere. It not only has all the functions of a computer -- calculating, word processing and tapping into data bases anywhere in the world -- but also acts as a television, telephone, note taker (you can use a pen or your voice), fax machine, mailbox, appointment calendar and even a sketch pad for artists and designers. Cerebral and soft-spoken, sounding more like a college professor than an evangelist, Mr. Sculley describes an emerging industry that he says will be a $3.5 trillion business within a decade. It will, he says, be more than half as large as the combined economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico are today.
10/20/1992	PowerBooks Include One More for the Road	APPLE COMPUTER introduced several new PowerBook portable Macintoshes yesterday, bolstering its most popular line with more power, better displays and the ability to connect directly to a wide variety of desktop monitors. Apple also added two new members of the desktop Macintosh II family, the Mac IIvi and the Mac IIvx.
10/19/1992	Latest Apple Bridges 2 Worlds	"In his obsessive pursuit of a quarry known to pursuers simply as Bob W., the head of Apple Computer's portable computing division once sent a product manager to an industry trade show to surreptitiously videotape competitors' products. Now, after a year of these and more traditional research methods, Apple believes it has come up with Bob W. -- an abbreviation for the """"best of both worlds"""" computer combining attributes of portable and desktop machines."
10/16/1992	I.B.M. Stumbles, While Apple Sets Records; Laptop Sales Spur Strong Earnings	Apple Computer Inc. today reported a 20 percent increase in fourth-quarter income and record revenues and earnings for the fiscal year, buoyed by sales of its Powerbook notebook computers. With more than $1 billion in sales during the year, the Powerbook is the most successful new personal computer since the original I.B.M. PC. Certainly, a good portion of those sales reflect pent-up demand because of Apple's delay in introducing a reasonably portable computer. Nonetheless, the Powerbook's sales have been superb, making it the leading notebook on the market.
9/22/1992	A New Mac Family for Your Home	"APPLE COMPUTER INC. has introduced a new family of low-cost Macintosh computers for use at home. The new Macs are called Performas, and they are the vanguard of what Apple executives say will be a series of """"consumer"""" products aimed at first-time buyers. The Performas will be sold only in department stores, office supply stores and consumer electronics stores, but not in traditional computer stores. The segmented distribution of the new models is a risky step for Apple, as it can cause confusion. A shopper who inquired about the Performas at his local computer store last week was told by an insistent sales clerk that the computers did not exist."
9/17/1992	60,000 Notebook Computers Are Being Recalled by Apple	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it was recalling some of its Macintosh Powerbook 100 notebook computers because of a potential safety problem. Apple said the malfunction, an electrical short that can cause a small hole to melt in the computer's plastic case, had occurred in only three of the nearly 60,000 Powerbook 100's that could be affected. No personal injury has occurred, the company said.
9/15/1992	Brand Names Fight Back Against the Clones	THE year is not yet over, but 1992 is likely to be remembered in the personal computer industry as the year the empires struck back against the rebel clones. First Compaq, then Digital, and now I.B.M. and Apple have begun impressive counterattacks against the low-cost personal computers that have hectored them for the last five years.
9/15/1992	New PC's From Apple	Apple Computer Inc. yesterday introduced a new line of Macintosh personal computers aimed at the home market and first-time buyers. The Performa line, which has three models, will be sold through mass merchandisers like Sears and Office Depot. They will not be available through computer dealers, which will continue selling the existing Macintosh line. The Performa 200 is identical to the Macintosh Classic II except for packaging and distribution and is expected to sell for about $1,250. The Performa 400 duplicates the Macintosh LC II and will sell for about $1,450, not including a monitor. The Performa 600 is a new design using a faster processor and an optional built-in CD-ROM drive. Including the drive but not a monitor, the model will sell for about $2,500.
8/28/1992	Apple to Sell Computers Priced for Home Market	"Apple Computer is poised for aggressive entry into the market for inexpensive home computers, hoping to tempt first-time computer buyers before they commit themselves to cheap I.B.M. clones, which now sell for well below $1,000. Apple said today that it was planning a Sept. 14 news conference in New York, where it would announce a new line of Macintosh computers aimed at a """"family"""" audience."
8/25/1992	A Way to Make Easy Even Easier	COMPUTER users will argue about it endlessly, but a strong case can be made that the Apple Macintosh is the easiest personal computer to use. The reason is Apple's operating system, which uses point-and-click commands. Even so, Apple has developed a new program that makes it even simpler to use the Mac. The software is called At Ease, and it is intended for children, teachers, business executives and people who hate computers. At Ease ($59) is actually a facade for Apple's regular System 7 operating system. Just as Microsoft's Windows hides the DOS operating system behind a pretty shell, At Ease hides the Macintosh's regular screen display behind a new screen design. It works only with System 7.0 or newer versions of the Mac operating system, and it requires a minimum of two megabytes of system memory.
8/4/1992	APPLE COMPUTER TO OFFER FASTER, CHEAPER POWERBOOK	Apple Computer Inc. said it would offer a midpriced version of its popular Powerbook notebook computer, offering higher performance at a lower price. The new Powerbook 145 incorporates all of the features of its predecessor, the 140, but offers 35 percent better performance by means of a faster microprocessor. It is available immediately, at $2,399 with a 40-megabyte hard disk, or $2,799 with an 80-megabyte disk. Apple's price reduction and improved performance reflect similar moves by makers of I.B.M.-compatible notebook computers.
7/21/1992	Making Your Mac Say Aargh!	"FROM the beginning, the Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh has had built-in sound and graphics abilities that other personal computers could match only with expensive add-ons. These abilities are getting better, as a new series of book-disk combinations from Hayden makes clear. """"Cool Mac Sounds,"""" by Craig O'Donnell, contains all the information an average user will need to load existing sounds or create new cheeps, beeps and burps. The accompanying disk includes several utilities for this purpose, some freeware, others shareware, which means you are asked to pay a nominal fee if you continue to use them. Almost two megabytes of programs and sounds have been compressed onto the 1.4-megabyte disk; you will need a newer Mac equipped with a Superdrive for access to them, and about three megabytes of space on a hard disk. The book assumes you are using System 6.0.7 or later."
7/16/1992	Armistice for Apple and Microsoft	Is nothing sacred in the computer world? For years, Apple and Microsoft have been at odds with each other, battling -- sometimes bitterly -- in forums ranging from the marketplace to the courtroom. In the last month, for example, an Apple advertising campaign has lambasted Microsoft's Windows program as being inferior to Macintosh software.
7/12/1992	The Executive Computer; A Computer or Not? Apple Readies Its Newton	"And now for something completely different! Stand by for Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton, a """"personal digital assistant"""" that Apple hopes to start selling next year. Some people who have seen a prototype have described the Newton as """"a Sharp Wizard on steroids""""; others say it recalls the communicators used by Captain Kirk and the crew of the Starship Enterprise. The Newton weighs about a pound, uses a special, unattached pen for data entry and runs on standard penlight batteries."
6/30/1992	Of Gaps and How to Bridge Them	THE personal computer industry is diverging and converging at the same time. An example of divergence is the split between International Business Machines and Microsoft on operating systems. An example of convergence is the alliance forged between I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. A smaller instance of convergence is that Claris, the software subsidiary of Apple, is introducing programs for Microsoft's Windows. One strength of Windows is that it makes a P.C. almost as easy to use as a Macintosh, and Claris has been making Macintosh software since 1987. I am writing this with the word-processing component of ClarisWorks, I keep my address book in the database module and, one of these days when we get organized around here, I will put my income-outgo information in its spreadsheet.
6/24/1992	Apple-I.B.M. Venture Chief Is Named	Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M. confirmed today that they had appointed A. Nathaniel Goldhaber, a venture capitalist and computer entreprenuer, as president and chief executive of their joint venture, Kaleida. Kaleida will begin business at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., until a permanent location is found in the San Francisco area. The venture will develop multimedia computer systems, which can combine audio, video and data displays on one machine.
6/24/1992	Apple to Work With Toshiba On 'Multimedia' Products	Apple Computer Inc., continuing its thrust into the consumer electronics business, said today that it would work with the Toshiba Corporation of Japan on joint development of products that combine sound and video with computers. At a news conference here, Apple and Toshiba said they would develop consumer-electronics devices that play CD-ROM's, which are compact disks that can store data, text and images as well as sound. The first product, which Toshiba will manufacture and both companies will sell, is expected to reach the market by the middle of 1993.
6/24/1992	Symantec and Apple in Accord	Apple Computer Inc. and the Symantec Corporation said today that they had agreed to develop and market technology enabling software developers to create programs that will run on either the Apple Macintosh or on personal computers using Microsoft's Windows software. The technology would ultimately support other software operating systems as well.
6/16/1992	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Apple Finds a New Arena For Its Fight With Microsoft	"After four years of battling the Microsoft Corporation and its Windows software in the courts, Apple Computer Inc. took the fight to a new arena last week with an advertising campaign that questions its rival's contention that the software is easy to use. Windows is a """"shell"""" program that runs on top of Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system software to give it an appearance and """"user friendliness"""" similar to Apple's Macintosh. With either system, users execute commands and create files by selecting graphical icons with a mouse pointing device. Both present what has come to be known as a graphical user interface."
6/11/1992	NORTHERN TELECOM'S VIDEO TELECONFERENCING SYSTEM	Northern Telecom yesterday introduced a video teleconferencing system designed to work with computers that are compatible with Apple Macintosh and I.B.M. machines. The Visit Video system will cost $2,900 to $3,500 and will require a special high-speed telephone connection. The system transmits a black and white image to the computer screen of another user. It also allows two people to work on the same computer document while connected over telephone lines. The system does not provide full-motion video, but instead transmits 8 to 15 frames a second. Earlier this year, Compression Labs Inc. and A.T.& T introduced a similar system that works with a personal computer or with a special video telephone.
6/2/1992	Macintosh Via Mail Delivers On Color	THERE were two surprisingly large boxes and a small one. Even after one has grown a bit blase, the arrival of a new computer brings a slight thrill of anticipation. The birth of a fifth child may not be accompanied by the same hoopla as the first, but neither is it humdrum. The boxes were big because of the padding -- paper, plastic and foam. It took about two hours, with several breaks, to set up the new machine. Most of the effort was for unpacking.
5/31/1992	Making a Difference; Chapter 3 From Apple	"After months of leaks and rumors, Apple Computer Inc. last week gave the world the first glimpse of its Newton technology, the key to a new line of portable pen-based computing devices. Apple expects these devices to bridge the gap between personal computers and consumer electronics. Lawrence G. Tesler, Apple's vice president for the Newton group, said the aim of the four-year-old project was to create devices that """"you would hold in your hands, that would be portable and very easy to use, but that would still have some computer-like properties."
5/29/1992	Apple to Give the Public Its First Look at Newton	On Friday, Apple Computer Inc. will take the wraps off its first entry into what its chairman, John Sculley, predicts will be a $3.5 trillion industry combining entertainment, communications and computing with digital technology. Dubbed Newton, the pocket-size, pen-based computer is the first completely new product introduced by Apple since the Macintosh in 1984, and the first created since the departure of Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder.
5/22/1992	Apple Forms A New Unit	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had formed a new business unit to develop the small, hand-held devices sometimes known as personal digital assistants. The new unit, Personal Interactive Electronics -- or Apple Pie -- is based at Apple headquarters here and has 200 employees.
5/19/1992	Of Turning The Pages Without Any Pages	ON his most recent business flight, the traveler tucked several novels into his shirt pocket and, as a last-minute precaution against having the book go blank, tossed an extra battery into his flight bag. One does not usually associate extra battery life with reading novels, but in the case of the Voyager Company's Expanded Books -- books designed to be read on an Apple Computer Macintosh Powerbook screen instead of on paper -- battery life becomes important. It simply would not do to have the book lose power just as the dinosaur's dripping jaws start to close on the hero's leg and . . .
5/13/1992	Apple Suit By Quorum	Quorum Software Systems Inc. said today that it had brought legal action against Apple Computer Inc. in United States District Court here. Quorum said it has asked the court to rule that Quorum has not infringed any copyrights or patents of Apple and to prohibit Apple from making assertions that Quorum's products violate any Apple intellectual property rights. Based in Menlo Park, Calif., Quorum produces software that allows application programs written for Apple's Macintosh, such as word processors or spreadsheets, to run on computer work stations, including those made by Sun Microsystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc. Quorum's lawsuit stems from recent letters in which Apple accused the company of infringing its intellectual property rights, and revoked Quorum's privileges as an Apple-certified software developer.
5/13/1992	Apple Ruling Reconsidered	A district court judge agreed today to reconsider his April 14 ruling throwing out most of Apple Computer Inc.'s long-running copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. Judge Vaughn Walker gave lawyers for Hewlett-Packard 20 days to file briefs in response to Apple's request for reconsideration. But the judge again chastised Apple for being late in its filings and for ignoring, until the last minute, his requests for an item-by-item account of the way the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company's products infringe Apple's copyrights.
4/16/1992	Ruling on Apple May Ease Development of Software	With most of Apple Computer's arguments in the company's four-year-old copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard tossed out by a Federal judge on Tuesday, many industry analysts said today that a freer operating environment could ensue for software developers. Still, they cautioned that the decision was an oral ruling by a lower court. Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker could offer different details in his final written ruling, or an appellate court could overturn it. Indeed, Apple Computer Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif., said it would proceed with its case.
4/15/1992	Most of Apple's Copyright Suit Is Dismissed	Apple Computer's long-running copyright infringement suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard was gutted today when Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker threw out its central elements in a surprise ruling. A few remaining items will be discussed at a hearing scheduled for May 12.
3/27/1992	Apple and Sharp Form Electronics Venture	"Apple Computer Inc. and the Sharp Corporation of Japan today announced an agreement to cooperate on the development of a computerized consumer electronics product. The agreement was part of Apple's effort to apply its software expertise to develop a series of new devices, which John Sculley, Apple's chairman, called """"personal digital assistants."""" These machines, many of which will be small enough to hold in a hand, would allow people to store their appointments and phone lists, send and receive information or store reference information."
3/23/1992	Apple Printer For Windows	In a foray into enemy territory, Apple Computer Inc. will introduce on Monday a laser printer and a scanner tailored for computers using the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system for I.B.M.-compatible equipment. The products represent efforts by Apple to increase its revenues by spreading its technology beyond users of its Macintosh computers. Apple has recently begun making some software available for computers other than the Macintosh.
3/20/1992	Apple's New Damage Claim	The Microsoft Corporation said today that Apple Computer Inc. had increased the amount it is seeking in damages in its long-running copyright infringement suit. The new amount, $5.55 billion, up from a previous claim of $4.37 billion, is subject to further adjustment during the course of the suit, and can be awarded only if there is a finding of infringement.
3/13/1992	Sun Link Is Sought By I.B.M.	I.B.M. has quietly invited the world's leading maker of computer work stations, Sun Microsystems Inc., to join an alliance that aims to set the course of the desktop computer industry. The International Business Machines Corporation, the world's largest computer maker, asked Sun in February to join Taligent, the joint venture it formed last year with Apple Computer Inc., the second-largest maker of personal computers.
3/8/1992	The Executive Computer; Apple-I.B.M. Venture, With New Leaders, Searches for a Soul	Taligent Inc. officially opened for business last week with 170 experienced employees, two new leaders, the most impressive venture backing in Silicon Valley and one of the toughest challenges faced by any computer software company. Taligent is an independent joint venture of Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation, with a mandate to develop operating system software that will be the foundation for business computers in the mid-1990's and into the 21st century.
3/5/1992	Apple to Adopt Pen-Based Units	Apple Computer Inc. said it would give its Macintosh computer the ability to be operated by a pen instead of a keyboard and mouse controller in the coming years. At a conference here on the company's software plans, Apple's chief executive, John Sculley, also clarified how the Macintosh operating system would compare with a new operating system being developed by Taligent, a joint venture of Apple and I.B.M.
3/4/1992	Apple Shows Products For Its Macintosh Line	Im an unusual sneak preview, Apple Computer Inc. today lifted the curtain on new software technologies that will begin appearing in its Macintosh computers over the next two years. In a two-day conference that began today at a wine-country resort, Apple executives said the Macintosh would continue to be a central product for Apple at least through the year 2000.
2/25/1992	Executives Appointed To I.B.M.-Apple Venture	The software joint venture between Apple Computer and I.B.M., outlined its senior management team and board members at a news conference here today. As expected, Joseph M. Guglielmi, a vice president from the International Business Machines Corporation, was named chairman and chief executive of the venture, Taligent Inc. But most of the executives who will report to him are from Apple Computer Inc.
2/21/1992	I.B.M.-Apple Appointment	Joseph Guglielmi, a vice president of I.B.M., will be named Monday to head Taligent, one of two joint ventures being formed by I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. as part of their broad alliance, industry officials said today. Mr. Guglielmi, a longtime I.B.M. employee, is now a leading official behind I.B.M.'s push to revive the OS/2 personal computer operating system, which has so far been slow to catch on with computer users.
2/12/1992	Microsoft Discloses Apple Claim	The Microsoft Corporation today disclosed that Apple Computer Inc. was seeking $4.37 billion in damages in its long-running copyright infringment suit against the software company. Apple sued Microsoft and the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1989, contending that Microsoft's Windows 2.03 and Hewlett-Packard's New Wave programs copied the look and feel of the Macintosh's visual displays. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., later amended its suit to include Windows 3.0, the version currently marketed by Microsoft.
1/28/1992	Apple Is Said To Set Price Cuts	Apple Computer Inc. will slash prices on some desktop Macintosh computers by 17 to 36 percent next week, the industry newspaper Macweek reported today. Macweek, which attributed its information to anonymous sources, said the cuts would come on various Macintosh II models as well as on the Macintosh LC and the Macintosh Classic II. An Apple spokeswoman said the company had no comment.
1/21/1992	Broader Use Of Macintosh Software Set	A Silicon Valley company plans to announce a program on Wednesday that permits users and developers to run programs designed for Apple Computer's Macintosh on Sun, I.B.M. and Silicon Graphics work stations. It will be the first significant attempt to use software designed for the Macintosh on other computers. The company, Quorum Software Systems, said that it had shown the software to Apple executives and that the companies were discussing possible licensing or other arrangements.
1/17/1992	Apple's Net Is Up 10.3% In Quarter	Spurred by sales of its new products, Apple Computer Inc. said today that net income for its first fiscal quarter increased 10.3 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. The Cupertino, Calif., personal computer company said net income for the three months ended Dec. 27 reached $166.0 million, or $1.36 a share, compared with $150.5 million, or $1.28 a share. Revenues grew 10.7 percent, to $1.86 billion from $1.68 billion.
1/12/1992	The Executive Computer; Reports With Sound Effects and Video	Quicktime, one of Apple Computer Inc.'s most exciting recent innovations, holds the promise of making video, animation and sound almost as easy to use in computer programs as text and graphics. A flood of products designed to take advantage of Quicktime will be demonstrated at the Macworld Expo trade show, which begins today in San Francisco. Quicktime, which is invisible to the average user, is essentially a set of standards and tools for software developers who are expected to use it to make spreadsheets, data bases, graphics programs, word processors and other applications capable of working with sound and video along with text and standard graphics. It was sent to software developers last month as an extension of the Macintosh operating system.
1/5/1992	Technology; Can Apple Sustain Its Drive Into Japan's Computer Market?	Armed with an array of incentives and a few technological advantages built into its computers, the Apple Computer Company has been enjoying a large measure of success in Japan in the last three years. But the company's continued prosperity in Japan depends in part on its ability to persuade United States software makers to participate in its efforts there. The allure of Japan for Apple is not hard to understand. With $7.6 billion in hardware sales in 1990, Japan has become the world's second-largest computer market, after the United States. And this market has been growing at double-digit annual rates, far outpacing the sluggish demand in the United States and Europe. Yet Japan has a low penetration rate of computers -- only about 14 percent of potential users already have computer hardware installed.
1/5/1992	The Executive Computer; Daunting Hurdles to Using System 7 on the Mac	Many executives and veteran computer users have long followed a policy of staying away from any software package whose version number ends in zero. Often through bitter experience, they have learned that software publishers frequently view their initial customers as an extended testing ground. Rather than contending with computer crashes and lost data, these veterans believe it is safer to wait for version 1.1, or even 1.5, rather than rush out to buy the hottest new program. This philosophy caused considerable anxiety last year among the many companies that use Macintoshes. After Apple Computer Inc.'s new operating system, 7.0, was introduced in May, companies had to decide whether to take the plunge. Would the expected benefits in productivity be worth the anguish of the transition?
1/4/1992	Apple-I.B.M. Plan Backed	The Federal Trade Commission has given I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. approval to proceed with two ventures planned to develop advanced personal computers and multimedia consumer products. The ventures, Taligent and Kaleida, will be set up in Silicon Valley in California with employees from both computer makers in an effort to carry out an ambitious plan hatched last year by executives of the computer makers. The officials called the plan an effort to revitalize the computer industry.
12/23/1991	Apple Settles Class Actions	Apple Computer Inc. says that it had agreed to settle two class-action lawsuits filed against the company in 1984 and 1991 by stockholders. Apple continues to deny any wrongdoing in the cases, and the company said Friday that it settled to avoid the expense and risk of further legal proceedings.
12/10/1991	Apple Chief Expects Gains	"John Sculley, the chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., said today that he expected Apple to keep growing strongly in 1992 despite continued sluggish growth for the personal computer industry as a whole. Speaking at the Technologic Partners personal computer conference, Mr. Sculley said he expected Apple's unit sales of computers to grow percentagewise by """"strong double-digit numbers."""" That level would be lower than the 60 percent unit growth Apple recorded in its 1991 fiscal year on the strength of new low-priced computers, but it would be far greater than the 5 percent unit growth Mr. Sculley said he expected for the personal computer industry as a whole."
12/8/1991	Technology; Two Men, Two Visions of One Computer World, Indivisible	With computer technology advancing at a lightning pace, it's hard to imagine that anyone could work on the same project for more than 30 years -- and still not finish it. But that is the case with two legendary figures of computerdom: Theodor Holm Nelson and Douglas C. Engelbart. The two men are very different.
11/30/1991	3 Companies Said to Invest In Venture	Sony and Motorola have joined Apple Computer in investing in a closely watched Silicon Valley start-up company that is developing a new type of portable computing device, industry executives said today. The start-up, General Magic Inc., was formed last year by three former Apple Computer Inc. employees with a minority investment from Apple. It is developing what it calls a personal intelligent communicator, which is believed to be a pocket-sized device that will help people organize personal notes and appointments and will receive and transmit faxes and computer data by radio waves.
11/28/1991	Apple Protests Loss of Air Force Contract	Apple Computer Inc. has formally protested the award of a billion-dollar Government contract to two small, privately held companies. Apple's lawyers said officials of the Air Force Standard Systems Center had told them that 20 of the 22 companies submitting bids were disqualified on technical grounds. The contract, known as Desktop IV, was awarded last week to the Compuadd Corporation, based here, and Sysorex Information Systems Inc. of Falls Church, Va. It calls for the delivery of as many as 300,000 desktop computers in the next three years, along with related software, peripheral equipment and support services.
11/11/1991	Apple Gives A Blueprint For Future	"In an unusual move to help customers, Wall Street and the computer industry to comprehend its strategy, Apple Computer Inc. has prepared an extensive document outlining its product directions for the future. The """"Blueprint for the Decade"""" does not discuss new products in detail, and some of its contents have been stated publicly by Apple executives in the last year. Nevertheless, the document contains some new information, particularly in light of Apple's recent cooperative agreement with the International Business Machines Corporation, and is another sign of a new openness at Apple, which has been reluctant to talk much about its future plans. Two-Part Strategy As Apple executives have suggested, the company seems to be separating its strategy into two parts -- one focusing on products for individuals and the other on more complex networks of computers for large corporations. The document further stresses that Apple will continue to seek alliances with other companies and """"will no longer go the distance alone."
10/29/1991	Apple's New Vision for Notebooks	COMPARED with DOS-based notebook computers, the three new Apple Powerbook notebook computers introduced at the Comdex Fall trade show in Las Vegas last week might appear rather mundane. Makers of I.B.M. PC-compatibles have been selling smaller, lighter, cheaper and more powerful notebooks for two years. That does not mean that Macintosh users will not buy Powerbooks as fast as Apple Computer Inc. can make them, of course. They are greatly superior to Apple's original Macintosh Portable, an expensive, heavy model, now discontinued.
10/27/1991	Technology; Mouse! Movie! Sound! Action!	"For years, Tony Bove has been collecting bootleg music videos and songs by the Beatles and other groups. Now, by using programs based on a new Apple Computer software standard called Quicktime, which allows video and sound to be incorporated in Macintosh computers, he is developing his own presentations for friends to play back on their Macs. These creations are like music videos, but they are also """"interactive,"""" allowing the computer user to cut among songs, movie scenes, animated graphics and excerpts from documentaries in response to whatever is on the screen at any moment."
10/22/1991	Both Ends of the Apple Spectrum	Apple Computer Inc., making it clear that it will no longer be an outsider in the personal computer industry, introduced an impressive collection of new Macintosh computers today at the Comdex Fall computer trade show here. Comdex Fall is the biggest annual event in the computer industry, but until this year Apple had been a minor participant in a show dominated by I.B.M. PC and compatible computers. Buoyed by its recent alliance with the International Business Machines Corporation, Apple not only came to Comdex, but also made one of the biggest opening-day splashes.
10/20/1991	The Executive Computer; Not Just Blue Sky: I.B.M. and Apple Have a Product	The new Apple-I.B.M. alliance is real and is about to deliver its first tangible products, so forget all the talk about it being years before the partnership bears fruit, executives of the two companies pronounced last week from a stage at the Networld trade show here. Ellen Hancock, vice president and general manager of the International Business Machines Corporation's communications division, and Michael Spindler, president of Apple Computer Inc., said the first joint product was a Token Ring network adapter board for the Macintosh, a green card that finally gives Apple resident status in the land of corporate computing. It will be ready by the end of the year, they said.
10/18/1991	Digital Net Up as Apple Posts Decline	The Digital Equipment Corporation, still suffering from the prolonged economic woes of the computer industry, said yesterday that profits rose 9.2 percent in the first fiscal quarter. And Apple Computer reported an 18 percent earnings decline even as sales grew almost 12 percent. The mixed results reflect Apple's shift to products with higher volume but lower profit margin, which has not yet been offset by internal cost-cutting efforts.
10/13/1991	FORUM;Farewell, PC -- What's Next?	The personal computer died this month. Its passing was marked by the alliance announced by Apple and International Business Machines in San Francisco, just north of the suburbs where the PC revolution began a little over a decade ago. The announcement amounted to belated admission by the two industry giants that the future of computing lies in the development of new systems as radically different from today's offerings as the original PC's differed from their predecessors.The personal computer may turn out to be like the horseless carriage, whose effect on our expectations was greater than its impact on our lives.  PC users daydreamed of electronic cottages and global villages but settled for word processors and spreadsheets instead.
10/13/1991	The Executive Computer; The Brave New World of I.B.M. and Apple	The contract was a foot thick, which gives some idea of the complexity of the deal signed earlier this month by Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation. Reduced to essentials, Apple and I.B.M. have agreed that they must join forces if they are to salvage any meaningful role in the personal computer industry of the 21st century. The two biggest PC makers vowed to work together to develop a generation of powerful business computers and an operating system for those computers. They hope to be done by the mid-1990's, meaning it will be years before the main results of the alliance are evident -- if the effort does not collapse under its own weight before then.
10/10/1991	Apple Computer's Next Ally May Be Sony	A week after Apple Computer put the finishing touches on a broad strategic alliance with I.B.M., it is quietly negotiating another major linkup, one that could blend American and Japanese technological strengths. This time the partner would be the iSony Corporation. Senior executives of both companies have confirmed in recent days that they have discussions under way about a new venture, but the details are closely guarded.
10/8/1991	Printing and Scanning	APPLE COMPUTER INC., returning its attention to the desktop publishing market that made the Macintosh computer so popular, introduced two new laser printers and a remarkable new scanner system last week. The scanner software, in particular, is a breakthrough product that promises to make it much simpler for average users to incorporate pictures into their laser-printed documents. Three new technologies are employed in Apple's products. One is called Fineprint, which is built into both of the new printers and which appears to be very similar to the Resolution Enhancement Technology pioneered by the Hewlett-Packard Company. Fineprint alters the placement of the little dots that make up text and drawings, reducing or eliminating jagged lines.
10/6/1991	Making a Difference; Apple's Man at the Front	After 11 years in key positions at Apple Computer Inc., Edward W. Birss is leaving. But he's not going far. Mr. Birss, 38, is expected to become the chief operating officer of Taligent, a joint venture being formed by Apple and the International Business Machines Corporation that is perhaps the most far-reaching part of their broad alliance.
10/3/1991	I.B.M. Now Apple's Main Ally	"Apple Computer and I.B.M. today signed the contract to create the much-heralded alliance that executives promised would """"change the landscape of computing in the 90's."""" But don't look for mountains to rise and rivers to change course just yet. In announcing details of their agreement at a news conference here, the one-time archrivals indicated that the fruits of their joint labors would not appear for two to four years in most cases, and that the biggest impact would not come until the second half of the decade, later than had been anticipated when the alliance was announced this summer."
9/30/1991	New Products Due From Sun and Apple	In a host of product introductions this week, Sun Microsystems Inc. will introduce powerful new computers, Apple Computer Inc. will announce sophisticated new printers and two companies will begin to challenge the Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor business. In addition to important computer products that will be introduced this week, details of the alliance between Apple and the International Business Machines Corporation are expected to be released. The flurry of announements reflects both the opening of Seybold Publications' desktop publishing conference in San Jose, Calif., this week, and an anticipation of Comdex, the huge personal computer trade show in Las Vegas in late October. And partly it is just coincidence.
9/24/1991	Aim of Apple-I.B.M. Tie Is Discussed	The chairman of Apple Computer and the president of I.B.M.'s personal computer business explained their proposed alliance publicly for the first time at an industry conference here today. They said the partnership was intended to restore growth and innovation in the desktop computer market, which has slowed markedly as it has matured. But the two executives refused to go beyond general comments on the new relationship, which stunned the computer world when it was announced earlier this year. A number of executives at both companies said the negotiations, which have at times involved as many as 400 people, had gone slower than had been expected, although they insisted final terms were near.
9/9/1991	Apple Verdict Is Reversed	A Federal judge has reversed a jury verdict that found the former chief executive of Apple Computer Inc. and another former executive liable for some $100 million in damages in a shareholder lawsuit. Judge James Ware of the United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., ruled on Friday that there was no evidence that the two executives had violated securities law, an Apple press release said. But Judge Ware ordered a new trial to determine whether Apple had itself violated the law. The jury had exonerated Apple.
9/9/1991	A Second Apple-I.B.M. Tie Expected	As part of their broad alliance, Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M. are expected to establish a second joint venture to concentrate on multimedia computing and to cooperate on radio communications for computers, industry executives and trade reports said over the weekend. In announcing their alliance in July, the two companies said they would form a jointly owned but independently managed company to develop advanced operating-systems software. They also said they would cooperate on multimedia, which means the ability of computers to display video images and reproduce sound. But they never gave specifics about the form of their multimedia cooperation.
9/7/1991	Apple Verdict Is Reversed	A Federal judge reversed a jury verdict today that found the former chief executive of Apple Computer Inc. and another former executive liable for some $100 million in damages in a shareholder lawsuit. The verdict had sent a chill through Silicon Valley, where shareholder suits are common but had never before resulted in such large damages.
9/4/1991	Sun to Enter Race to Offer Software	Sun Microsystems Inc. is beginning an attempt to become a major supplier of operating system software for computers, putting it into direct competition with Microsoft and a new joint venture of Apple and I.B.M. Sun will announce on Wednesday that it is developing a version of its operating system, which is the basic set of commands for controlling computers, that will run on personal computers using microprocessors made by the Intel Corporation. Sun's operating system now runs only on machines that use Sun's Sparc microprocessor. Such machines are mainly Sun's own work stations.
9/3/1991	Finally, No-Mess Painting for Kids	"KIDPIX is a new paint program for the Apple Macintosh that has the potential to become the computer-era equivalent of fingerpaints. Broderbund Software Inc., which makes the popular Carmen San Diego series of educational games, has crafted Kidpix to be easy to learn, simple to use and just plain fun. Kidpix is not a replacement for """"grown-up"""" Macintosh paint programs, like Pixelpaint, Superpaint or Canvas, which can be used to create sophisticated graphic arts images and business presentations. It is, instead, a simple paint program that comes with dozens of wacky tools and special effects, including sounds. The program is virtually guaranteed to keep the interest of any child, and even grown-ups are likely to be enchanted by it."
8/29/1991	Apple Computer Offering Rebates	Apple Computer Inc. said it would offer rebates of $125 to $800 on certain Macintosh computers sold in the United States between Sept. 1 and Jan. 5, 1992. To qualify, customers must also buy a printer or monitor or purchase three computers at once. Apple said the rebates were intended to encourage buying during the back-to-school and Christmas seasons.
8/21/1991	Apple Venture With Adobe	Healing a rift between the two companies, Apple Computer Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc. signed a letter of intent today that calls for Apple to include Adobe's computer font technology in a future version of System 7, Apple's new operating system for the Macintosh. In May 1990, Apple announced that it would develop its own software to replace Adobe's Postscript, which controls the output of laser printers. Apple backed away from that stand a year later, saying it would continue to license Postscript from Adobe, and today's agreement goes a step further. Apple said it would develop the software necessary to support Adobe's Type 1 font technology within the Macintosh operating system. Apple said it would also continue to support its own Truetype font formats.
8/14/1991	Apple Is Planning Research Center	Apple Computer Inc. will build a $102 million research and development center on a site now occupied by Motorola Inc. Apple said in a quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the center would include 856,000 square feet in six buildings, which will be used for general research on hardware and software.
8/6/1991	On Shuttle, Wristmacs Help Out	As the space shuttle Atlantis passes overhead this week, several of the astronauts are wearing Wristmac watches that can display data taken from an Apple Macintosh Portable computer that is on board. When it is time to snap photographs of a particular feature on Earth or in the cosmos, a Wristmac will sound an alarm and display a two-line individual chore reminder. If schedules must be changed, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials at the Johnson Space Center in Houston can transfer updated files to the orbiting Mac Portable from Earth-based Macintoshes via fax modem, said Debra Muratore, a NASA engineer. Ms. Muratore is manager of a project looking for the best ways to use computers on a space station.
7/30/1991	Apple Computer In Soviet Market	Apple Computer Inc. is selling its Macintosh machine with Russian-language software in the Soviet Union. Greg Borovsky, Apple's director in the Soviet Union, said the company signed a one-year contract this month to set up dealerships with Intermicro, a Soviet-Austrian venture based in Moscow.
7/26/1991	Rulings in Macintosh Suit	A Federal judge today dismissed several claims raised by the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company in response to a copyright suit by Apple Computer Inc. over its Macintosh display technology. In a series of pretrial rulings, Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker said Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard would not be allowed to argue at trial that the Macintosh pictorial window displays lacked the originality required for copyright protection.
7/18/1991	Loss for Apple; Record Profit at Intel	Apple Computer Inc. today reported increased revenues but a net loss for its third fiscal quarter because of lower profit margins and charges associated with layoffs and reorganizating. Apple also said that while growth in shipments of its Macintosh personal computers remained strong, the growth rate fell to 60 percent, from 85 percent in the quarter a year earlier.
7/14/1991	The Executive Computer; What's in I.B.M.'s and Apple's Gunsights? Microsoft	The real significance of the recently announced treaty between the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc., some analysts say, is that it is likely to end the industry's dependence on the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, which started out supplying key components of the original I.B.M. PC and eventually wrested control of the personal computer industry and its profits. Since I.B.M. introduced its PC 10 years ago, personal computers and software have grown into a $60 billion annual market. But I.B.M.'s share of the PC market has been reduced by hungry rivals, and Apple has been hurt by its inability to gain a foothold in the corporate market. Through their alliance, they hope to reassert control. In the proposed deal, Apple would become, in essence, a software company competing directly against Microsoft. I.B.M. would provide the microprocessor technology for a generation of powerful desktop business computers. The chip itself is to be built by Intel's archrival, Motorola Inc., as well as by I.B.M. itself.
7/14/1991	A Quirky Loner Goes Mainstream	When Apple Computer Inc. announced its all but unthinkable partnership with the International Business Machines Corporation earlier this month, some Apple employees coverd up the rainbow-colored apple in front of their building with a new logo - also an apple, but one done in the characteristic blue stripes of i.B.M. It might have been meant as a protest or merely as a joke. But it was certainly symbolic - Apple is changing its stripes. The agreement is only one piece, albeit the biggest, of a huge transformation that the personal computer pioneer is undertaking. Long content with being the BMW of the computer industry, suppying finely crafted machines to a relatively small number of fanatic customers, Apple now wants to become a Ford or Toyota, to move into the mainstream.
7/12/1991	I.B.M. to Buy Metaphor to Aid Apple Plan	As a first step toward establishing a joint software development company with Apple Computer Inc., I.B.M. announced yesterday that it would buy Metaphor Inc., a Silicon Valley software developer. Metaphor is reported to be the focal point of the two computer makers' plan to create a joint software system that will redefine desktop personal computing in the second half of the decade. Terms of the proposed purchase by I.B.M. were not disclosed.
7/7/1991	The Executive Computer; Can You See the Standards Through the Fog?	Like fog banks rolling over an already jumbled terrain, in the last two weeks two alliances each proposed to create a new industrywide standard for the class of powerful personal computers known as RISC-based work stations. Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation signed a letter of intent on Wednesday to develop advanced operating system software that will run on the next generation of both Apple and I.B.M. high-end personal computers. The computers will be built around a new version of I.B.M.'s RISC System/6000 microprocessor, which will be jointly developed by I.B.M. and Motorola Inc.
7/7/1991	Headliners; For Computers, Call David and Goliath, Inc.	ONLY a month ago it would have been unthinkable, but last week freewheeling Apple Computer and staid I.B.M. put aside their decade-long rivalry and agreed to jointly develop software and hardware and set a new standard for the next generation of computers, which will combine pictures and sound with more conventional means of displaying data. The agreement of intent signed by the two largest makers of personal computers is the latest in a series of collaborations between manufacturers and software developers trying to reverse sliding profits.
7/7/1991	Making a Difference; Pact Leaves Motorola in an Odd Position	Last week's extraordinary agreement between Apple Computer and the International Business Machines Corporation, longtime archenemies, may have left executives at Motorola Inc. wondering if they would end up in the catbird seat or the hot seat. As part of their agreement to form a joint venture in software, Apple and I.B.M. both also agreed to use a new version of I.B.M.'s RS/6000 microprocessor to be designed and manufactured by Motorola. The new chip will make Motorola a strong contender in the race to define an industry standard based on RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, a technology that simplifies and speeds up computers. But it also put Motorola in the uncomfortable position of manufacturing a chip which could wipe out its own RISC processor, the 88000.
7/4/1991	I.B.M. and Apple Give Up Rivalry To Preserve Grip on Their Industry	Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M., longtime archenemies, threw in their lots together today in a bold attempt to maintain their powerful yet threatened positions in the computer industry. The two companies have signed a letter of intent to work together to create advanced software and powerful computers in a deal that despite being rumored for weeks still had the industry abuzz when it was officially announced.
7/3/1991	Apple-I.B.M. Pact Is Said To Be Near	Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation are expected to announce Wednesday the formation of an alliance that would combine the strengths of two of the most powerful companies in the computer industry. The agreement, which has been the subject of industry speculation for several weeks, is expected to be even broader than what has already been reported. In addition to a technology exchange, the pact is expected to pave the way for the two companies to sell some of each other's products, according to one industry executive who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
6/27/1991	Snag Seen With I.B.M. And Apple	"Talks between Apple Computer and I.B.M. about creating a far-reaching technology alliance have bogged down over a number of thorny issues, people involved in the talks said yesterday. As late as midday Tuesday, executives at both companies had been saying a joint news announcement would be held in San Francisco on Thursday. """"It's not cooked, so we're not ready to take it out of the oven,"""" one participant said yesterday. No timetable has been set for continuing the discussions, he said."
6/25/1991	New Software for Apple Links With I.B.M. Units	As part of an increased effort to attract corporate customers, Apple Computer Inc. yesterday introduced its first software package that allows users of large networks of its Macintosh personal computers to communicate easily with I.B.M. mainframes and minicomputers. Analysts said the Apple software was an improvement over the cumbersome communications software now available from third-party suppliers.
6/23/1991	Making a Difference; Biting Back	"As Apple Computer Inc. began to implement its plan to eliminate 1,500 jobs through layoffs and attrition, the specter of collective bargaining raised its head again last week in the largely nonunion Silicon Valley. An employee group, which had formed during the last batch of layoffs in February 1990 but later disbanded, reformed and staged a demonstration at the company's Cupertino headquarters. Many of the protesters are not interested in forming a traditional union, said Richard M. Eames, an Apple engineer and self-appointed spokesman for Employees for One Apple, which numbers about 500. Instead, said Mr. Eames, their goal is to create """"a communications channel so that we can talk with management rather than have them come to us with directives."
6/21/1991	Apple to Cut Executive Pay	As part of an effort to reduce costs, top executives at Apple Computer Inc. will take pay cuts, effective June 28, the company said today. John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, will take a 15 percent cut; Michael Spindler, Apple's president and chief operating officer will take a 10 percent cut, as will all members of the executive management team and all senior vice presidents, all other executives will take 5 percent cuts in salary.
6/20/1991	Union Talk At Apple	A group of Apple Computer Inc. workers, upset by the company's plan to eliminate 1,500 jobs, said today that they were considering a collective-bargaining effort, raising the specter of a union in the largely nonunionized Silicon Valley. Leaders of the workers' group, called Employees for One Apple, say that its membership totals 500. They have been talking with management since February 1990, but only recently began considering forming a union or a collective-bargaining group.
6/18/1991	Apple May Expand Its Copyright Suit	A Federal District Court judge granted Apple Computer Inc.'s request to add two software packages to the list of products that Apple contends infringe the copyrights for the company's Macintosh personal computer. The additional products in Apple's three-year-old copyright suit are Windows 3.0 by the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company's New Wave 3.0. The suit had applied to Windows 2.03 and New Wave.
6/16/1991	Business Diary/June 9-14	COMPANIES Can Apple and I.B.M. Find Common Ground?
6/14/1991	Progress Reported in Talks On an I.B.M.-Apple Venture	Apple Computer and I.B.M. are making progress toward forming an alliance after a high-level meeting between the two companies on Monday at I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. Officials of the companies agreed on the very broad outlines of a technology exchange accord, industry executives said. Work is proceeding at lower levels within the companies toward more specific terms.
6/14/1991	Apple Suit With Hewlett	A Federal District judge today heard several motions from Apple Computer Inc. and the Hewlett-Packard Company in the long-running copyright infringment suit brought by Apple against Hewlett-Packard and the Microsoft Corporation. Apple sued in 1988, claiming that visual elements in Microsoft's Windows and Hewlett's New Wave programs infringe its copyrights on the Macintosh user interface.
6/10/1991	TECHNOLOGY LINKS WILL BE DISCUSSED BY APPLE AND I.B.M.	Top executives of Apple Computer Inc. will be visiting the headquarters of the International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., on Monday to discuss a far-ranging technology alliance that could have a major impact on the computer industry, industry executives say. One part of the talks, according to these executives, is a proposal for I.B.M. to license from Apple, and perhaps even to help develop, basic software for a new line of Apple computers that will be a successor to its Macintosh family.
6/8/1991	One-Two Punch for PC Makers	"For years, the personal computer industry has been regarded as one of America's most vibrant businesses. It seemed to embody the American corporation's ability to innovate and to capitalize on cost-cutting research. As the industry brought powerful computers within the reach of businesses and households, bountiful profits were generated for the companies and their investors. But now the industry, and particularly its leaders -- Apple Computer, Compaq and I.B.M. -- face a real test. A squeeze at both ends of their market has sent their profits plummeting. The question is whether they can define strategies that will help them break out of the industry stall and produce the kind of growth and profitability they are used to. 'The Desktop Is Dead' """"The secular problem is the desktop is dead,"""" said Roger McNamee, an industry analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. """"The PC industry is mature, and MS-DOS is aging,"""" he added, referring to the operating system that is used by the majority of I.B.M. and I.B.M.-compatible personal computers. """"The only things that are growing are graphical interface, portable computers and network computing. If you don't have two out of three, you're dead."
6/4/1991	An Apple PC Version of Lotus 1-2-3	"The Lotus Development Corporation today announced its long-delayed 1-2-3 spreadsheet program for the Apple Macintosh. Lotus vowed to catch its rival, the Microsoft Corporation, whose Excel spreadsheet has a commanding lead in the Macintosh market. """"This is a product that will meet any scrutinizing that any skeptic might have,"""" said Apple's chairman, John Sculley, who spoke at Lotus's annual meeting here. """"I was skeptical,"""" he added, but he said that Lotus had finally developed a version of 1-2-3 that was suitable for the Macintosh. That view was shared by several analysts. No Direct Stake Apple has no direct stake in the Lotus product, but computer companies are always pleased when popular software becomes available for their machines because it enhances sales. This time, Mr. Sculley has a particularly strong reason to cheer: A Macintosh using the new Lotus program can read 1-2-3 files from an I.B.M. or compatible computer, either directly from a disk or over a network."
6/1/1991	Jury Backs Investors in Apple Suit	Two former executives of Apple Computer Inc. misled investors in 1983 about the fruitless attempt of the company to build its own disk drive and should pay millions of dollars in damages, a Federal jury has decided. A. C. Markkula, an Apple co-founder, and John Vennard, a former vice president, failed to disclose the degree of technical problems Apple had in developing a disk drive that was nicknamed Twiggy, the panel decided on Thursday.
5/26/1991	The Executive Computer; More Oomph With Mac's System 7.0	"The Apple Macintosh has long been acknowledged as easier to use than the more widely sold I.B.M. PC's and compatibles, and the key to that ease of use has been the computer's operating system software. Apple Computer Inc.'s improved version of the Macintosh operating system, called System 7.0, adds more power to the computer without increasing its complexity. The first thing a user will notice about System 7.0 is the subtle addition of 3-D effects and color shading on the """"desktop,"""" the area of the screen where work takes place. But the beauty of System 7.0 is more than screen deep, and executives who tap into its power will discover a series of features that will wring more power from their software."
5/24/1991	Apple Broadens Attack In Copyright Lawsuit	In a surprise move, Apple Computer Inc. has opened a new line of attack in its copyright infringement lawsuit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard by asking the court to rescind a 1985 licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft. If Apple's request is granted it will leave the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company far more vulnerable to infringement claims, since the licensing agreement has been the central part of their defense.
5/21/1991	Apple Computer to Reduce Staff 10%, Cutting 1,560 Jobs	Apple Computer Inc. confirmed today that it would reduce its work force by 10 percent, or about 1,560 people, as part of the company's efforts to reduce costs. Apple said the work force reduction, the fourth and largest in the company's history, would affect all job classifications worldwide, including contractors and temporary employees. Apple shares fell $2 Friday on rumors of the reduction and closed today at $44.25, off an additional $2.75, in over-the-counter trading. Apple made its announcement today after the market's close.
5/20/1991	Companies in Apple Suit Pessimistic on Settling	"The companies in the closely watched copyright lawsuit filed by Apple Computer Inc. against the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, have discussed settling the case, according to a court filing. The companies said, however, that """"there are no foreseeable prospects for a settlement."""" The brief mention of settlement talks was in a statement filed jointly by the companies on Friday in the Federal District Court in San Francisco. The filing was designed to outline the positions of the companies on where the case should go from here. Judge Vaughn R. Walker will hold a hearing on that subject on Thursday."
5/20/1991	Market Place; Apple Pays Price For New Strategy	THE move by Apple Computer Inc. to gain market share by introducing lower-priced machines is succeeding, but the resulting strain on profits has driven its stock down. Its supporters among Wall Street analysts say the company is being penalized for long-term planning. When Apple warned three weeks ago that its earnings for the quarter ending in June could be below the levels of a year before, investors hammered the stock, sending it plummeting $7.75, to $47.25, in one day of over-the-counter trading. Since then the shares have rebounded a bit, but on Friday they closed at $47, down $2 for the day. Within the last 52 weeks, Apple traded as high as $72.
5/19/1991	The Executive Computer; For Macintosh Users, a Very Long Wait Is Over	Apple Computer Inc. last week formally introduced a substantially upgraded version of the Macintosh operating system, called System 7.0. It had been eagerly awaited and long delayed. Apple officials said they expected 1.5 million to 3 million Macintosh users to switch to System 7.0 this year, and analysts said System 7.0 was Apple's best hope for keeping the rival Windows operating system from the Microsoft Corporation at bay. Indeed, the analysts hailed the introduction of System 7.0 as one of the most significant events in Apple's flagship product line since the debut of the original Macintosh in 1984.
5/18/1991	Apple Is Quiet On Job Cuts	Apple Computer Inc. today refused to confirm or deny a published report that it was considering laying off up to 12 percent of its work force of 15,600. A spokesman, Christopher Escher, said the computer maker was exploring ways to offset its lower profit margins by reducing operating expenses, but that he could not speculate as to what form the reductions might take. The San Francisco Chronicle reported today that Apple executives were discussing layoffs of 600 to 2,000 employees, primarily administrative personnel.
5/15/1991	Rival's Building In Apple's Ad	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would continue to run newspaper advertisements for its Macintosh software, even though a photograph of a competitor's office building is inadvertently featured in the ad. The ad, which ran in three nationally distributed newspapers today and on Monday, shows a Macintosh computer hooked up to the I.B.M. Tower in Atlanta. Apple's ad agency, BBDO Los Angeles, said it obtained the photo from a studio after requesting a generic picture of an office building.
5/7/1991	Apple Ready to Introduce Delayed Macintosh System	System 7, the long-awaited upgrading of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh operating system, is scheduled to be introduced next Monday. By offering Macintosh users new abilities to exchange data between computers and between different programs, the new software could lift sales of Apple's more expensive machines, just as those machines have begun to lag.
5/2/1991	Apple Warns of an Earnings Dip	Although its sales are growing rapidly after it cut prices on its popular Macintosh machines, Apple Computer Inc. said today that its earnings for the third quarter of its fiscal year might be lower than for the corresponding period a year earlier. Apple executives said the dollar's resurgence on currency exchanges and the company's shift toward lower-priced products would hurt profit margins for the quarter ending June 30.
4/23/1991	Apple to Halt Use of CFC's	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had developed a new technique that could eliminate the use of environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons in computer manufacturing. Apple said it had started using the new technique in its factories and would share it with the rest of the electronics industry. The personal computer company, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., said it would eliminate its own use of chlorofluorocarbons by 1993 and possibly by 1992.
4/20/1991	Apple Computer Settles Claim on Job Bias	Fourteen black people who charged that Apple Computer Inc. refused to hire them because of their race have won jobs with the company and a settlement of more than $400,000. Apple Computer admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, the largest of its kind negotiated in the Labor Department's San Francisco region.
4/16/1991	Apple Computer Profits Off; Cheaper Machines Lift Sales	Reflecting its shift toward selling higher volumes of lower-priced machines, Apple Computer Inc. today reported increased revenues but a slight decline in earnings for the second fiscal quarter that ended on March 29. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it shipped 85 percent more Macintosh personal computers than during the same period a year ago.
4/5/1991	Apple Planning A Revamping	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would reorganize to focus on new areas. The Cupertino, Calif., company said it would create separate divisions for its Macintosh hardware and system software and for dealing with large corporations. The divisions will have their own engineering and marketing staffs to speed up product development.
3/21/1991	Apple Will Buy Colorado Plant	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would expand its manufacturing capacity by purchasing a 340,000- square-foot building in Fountain, Colo. The building, which is owned by the Data General Corporation, will be Apple's fourth manufacturing plant, adding to existing factories in Fremont, Calif.; Cork, Ireland, and Singapore. Fountain is about 12 miles south of Colorado Springs. Apple's Fountain plant, which will employ between 800 and 1,000 people in the next several years, is expected to begin operation this fall. Apple plans to staff the factory mostly with locally recruited employees. It will be managed by Jim Bilodeau, who has previously held several key positions in Apple Worldwide Manufacturing.
3/19/1991	Type Without Tears	TRUETYPE is a new technology from Apple Computer Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation that greatly improves the way text appears on the computer screen and on printed documents. Truetype allows the user to make the type as big or small as needed, in any increment, and it gets rid of the jagged lines and broken curves that appear when you least want them. Impatient Macintosh users can add Truetype to the latest operating system software (version 6.0.7) by obtaining a special Truetype program from user groups or from on-line information services like Compuserve or America Online. Otherwise, Truetype will be included in the next versions of Macintosh system software (version 7.0, expected in May) and Microsoft Windows (version 3.1, later this year) for I.B.M. PC's and compatibles.
3/19/1991	Apple May Widen Sale Of Operating Systems	Apple Computer Inc. is likely to become much more aggressive in competing with the Microsoft Corporation and others as a vendor of operating systems, the basic software for controlling computers, according to Apple officials and industry executives. In a speech here today and in remarks to reporters afterward, Apple's chairman and chief executive, John Sculley, suggested that Apple was developing a new operating system that could run on several different types of microprocessors and on different types of computers, not only Apple's machines. A Dramatic Departure The move would be a dramatic departure for Apple, which has always guarded its operating systems software like a crown jewel. And it would match a move by the Microsoft Corporation, which is developing a new operating system called OS/2 Version 3, which will run on computers using a variety of microprocessors, including those using advanced technology known as RISC, or reduced instruction set computing.
3/12/1991	Printers Catching Up	APPLE COMPUTER INC., which has achieved remarkable success in the last five months with its low-cost Macintosh Classic and Macintosh LC personal computers, now has a pair of low-cost, laser-quality personal printers to go along with them. In the same announcement yesterday, Apple also introduced its long-awaited Truetype font technology and cut the prices of most of its other laser printers by $500 to $1,000, depending on the model.
3/12/1991	Apple Cutting Computer Price	Continuing its recent strategy of moving to increase market share by cutting profit margins, Apple Computer Inc. announced significant price reductions today on its mid-range and high-end Macintosh personal computers. The price cuts on the SE/30, IIci and IIfx modes range from 10 percent to 31 percent and are effective immediately. The SE/ 30 is now $3,369 to $3,869, depending on hard disk drive and memory; the IIci is now $5,269 to $5,969, and the IIfx is now $7,369 to $8,669.
3/11/1991	2 New Printers From Apple	Apple Computer Inc. will introduce two new lower-cost printers on Monday as part of its strategy to make the Macintosh personal computer and associated equipment more affordable. The new printers, which will be immediately available, are priced at $599 for the Stylewriter, an ink-jet printer, and $1,299 for the Personal Laserwriter LS, a laser printer.
3/8/1991	Ruling Bolsters Apple Shares	The stock of Apple Computer Inc. moved up today and that of the Microsoft Corporation moved down in the wake of a court decision that was favorable to Apple in its long-running software copyright suit against Microsoft and the Hewlett- Packard Company. A Federal judge on Wednesday rejected two arguments made by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard that would have weakened Apple's lawsuit or resulted in its being thrown out of court. While the three-year- old case is far from over, it is moving closer to a jury trial.
3/7/1991	Judge Favors Apple Stand On Copyright	A Federal judge today dismissed two critical defenses offered by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in the software copyright-infringment lawsuit filed against them by Apple Computer Inc. The ruling could move the now three-year-old case closer to trial. Had the judge accepted the arguments by the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, Apple's case would have been substantially weakened and might have been tossed out entirely.
3/1/1991	An Apple Vice President To Head Software Unit	Daniel L. Eilers, a nine-year veteran of Apple Computer Inc., has been named president and chief executive of the Claris Corporation, Apple's software subsidiary in Santa Clara, Calif. The appointment is effective March 18. Mr. Eilers, who is 35, succeeds William V. Campbell, who left last month to become president and chief executive of the Go Corporation, which is developing operating software for pen-based computers. No successor has been named to Mr. Eilers's current position as Apple's vice president for strategic planning and corporate development.
2/19/1991	Personal Professors, Pupils and Pitfalls	"THERE are two new professors on the faculty, and they're eager to start teaching. Professor Mac and Professor Windows are instruction programs that use, respectively, the Macintosh operating system and Microsoft Windows 3.0 to train beginners in these two similar approaches to running a personal computer. But aren't those operating systems so straightforward, so friendly, that lessons in them are unnecessary? Frankly, no, despite carefully fostered impressions to the contrary. Clicking a button on a mechanical mouse is not part of the species' genetic inheritance, although it may be slightly more intuitive than typing """"copy a:*.* c:."
2/16/1991	Sony Is Near Macintosh Pact	"The Sony Corporation will manufacture significant portions of a new Macintosh laptop computer being developed by Apple Computer Inc., Sony executives said. The officials said the two companies had not reached a final agreement on the exact extent of Sony's involvement in the computer. Reports of Sony's involvement in the Macintosh laptop first appeared several months ago. Earlier this week, Apple's chairman, John Sculley, refused to comment on the laptop computer until it was formally announced, but he noted that Apple was already one of Sony's biggest customers. Sony supplies Apple with floppy disk drives and computer screens. """"The two companies get along very well together,"""" he said."
2/12/1991	Apple Upgrades Portable, Cuts Cost	Apple Computer Inc. lowered the price of its Macintosh Portable by more than $1,000, added back lighting to make the screen easier to read and increased the internal memory by one megabyte. The changes represent an effort to improve the poor sales of the machine, but they are not expected to help much because the computer, which weighs more than 15 pounds, is still considered too heavy to compete with notebook computers that weigh five to seven pounds. The Macintosh Portable, which has a built-in 40 megabyte hard disk drive, will now sell for $4,200 with two megabytes of internal memory. Apple's stock rose $1.50 today, to $61.375, in over-the-counter trading.
2/9/1991	Group Seen Nearing PC Accord	A powerful group of computer makers and software publishers is nearing an agreement to develop a standard for an advanced desktop computer that it hopes will unseat the reigning powers of the personal computer industry by the middle of the decade. The emerging alliance, led by Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Digital Equipment, is gambling that it can create a personal computer based on a chip design called RISC that is simpler and faster than that used in computers made by I.B.M., Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems, the leaders in the desktop sector of the industry.
1/29/1991	Apple Seeks Radio Slot For Use by Computers	Apple Computer Inc. asked the Federal Communications Commission today to set aside radio frequencies to allow personal computers to receive and transmit data without wires. Allowing computers to communicate by radio would give more mobility to users of miniature portable computers that are now appearing on the market.
1/24/1991	Small Company in Effort To Clone an Apple Computer	Working in a small office here two miles from the headquarters of Apple Computer Inc., a start-up company is close to completing the technology for what it says will make possible the first legal clones of the Apple Macintosh computer. The company, Nutek Computers Inc., will face many legal and marketing obstacles in selling its technology. It was also impossible to verify the company's claims that machines that could be made with the technology would be able to run the same software operational programs that Macintosh does and work with Macintosh printers, pointing devices and other peripheral products.
1/18/1991	I.B.M. Surprises Wall Street With Strong Quarterly Net; Apple Posts 20.6% Rise	"Buoyed by strong sales of three new Macintosh models, Apple Computer Inc. reported increased sales and earnings for its first quarter, which ended Dec. 28. With demand exceeding supply of the Macintosh Classic, a new low-priced computer, Apple's results could have been stronger yet. """"Our strategy to significantly increase the installed base of Macintosh users by offering the computers people want at more affordable prices is clearly working,"""" John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement."
1/9/1991	Sales Are Strong For Macintosh	Apple Computer Inc.'s chairman, John Sculley, said the new Macintosh Classic should sell more machines in its first year than any other computer introduced by Apple. The Classic, with an entry price of $1,000, was introduced in October, and Apple has been unable to keep up with demand. But Apple executives said the company should catch up by the end of March. Mr. Sculley did not disclose any sales numbers, but his description suggested that Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., might sell nearly a million Classics this fiscal year.
1/8/1991	Mac Classic's Hot Price	"THE biggest drawback of the new Apple Macintosh Classic is that it is sometimes difficult to find. Introduced nearly three months ago, it is only now starting to appear in stores in significant numbers, and Apple Computer Inc. says that orders could be backlogged until April. """"We were very aggressive in forecasting demand for the Classic, but it exceeded our wildest expectations,"""" an Apple spokesman said."
1/8/1991	Apple Computer	Apple Computer Inc. introduced a series of products that are intended to make it easier for its Macintosh computers to connect to other computers in networks using the popular Ethernet standard. Providing easier connections to other computers is considered essential for Apple, because Macintosh computers are not compatible with the vast majority of personal computers in an office. The new products include Ethernet connectivity circuit boards for the Macintosh II family of computers and for the Mac LC.
11/28/1990	Chip Company Is Established	"A new computer chip company has been formed with the backing of Apple Computer Inc., VLSI Technology Inc., Acorn Computers of Britain and the Sanyo Electric Company of Japan. Based in Cambridge, England, Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. will develop and produce chips using reduced instruction set computing technology in designs originating at Acorn. The company will focus on applications in which ultralow power consumption, high performance and low cost are critical, including personal and portable computers and telephones. VLSI will manufacture the designs. Larry Tesler, an Apple vice president, said in a statement, """"We believe that the technology represents an important trend for the 1990's."""" He did not indicate how Apple might use the chip. Apple's involvement could be read as a blow to Motorola Inc., which has supplied the central microprocessor for the company's computers. While Motorola itself produces microprocessors based on RISC, they have been slow to gain market acceptance. Apple has yet to build a computer using RISC, a technology for speeding computation."
11/24/1990	Apple-VLSI Pact Is Seen	Apple Computer Inc. and VLSI Technology Inc., a maker of custom chips called application-specific integrated circuits, or ASIC's, are expected to announce a joint development agreement on Tuesday. The companies declined to elaborate except to confirm that they would make a joint announcement at VLSI's headquarters in San Jose. Shares in VLSI shot up 20 percent Wednesday on rumors that Apple would be taking a financial stake in the company. VLSI has supplied Apple with custom chips since 1981. VLSI's shares closed today at $4.875, up 25 cents in over-the-counter trading. Apple also rose 25 cents, to $36.375.
11/13/1990	Apple Shifts President's Title	"Michael H. Spindler, Apple Computer Inc.'s chief operating officer, has been named president. The appointment does not involve any changes in responsibilities but endorses Mr. Spindler's leadership role, Mr. Spindler will continue to report to John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive who had also been president. Mr. Spindler was also nominated to Apple's board. """"These actions represent strong votes of confidence in Michael Spindler and ringing endorsements of the excellent job he has done at Apple since becoming chief operating officer in February,"""" Mr. Sculley said. After several years of fast growth, Apple has recently experienced a slowing of its sales and a decline in its share of the desktop computer market. Critics said the problems were caused by the high prices Apple charged for its Macintosh line at a time when clones of the International Business Machines Corporation personal computers dominated the low end of the market. Apple has now overhauled its strategy, hoping to trade high profit margins for increased sales. It introduced low-cost Macintoshes last month that start at just under $1,000. Mr. Spindler, who headed Apple's European operations, was made chief operating officer in a top-level reorganization. He took over sales, marketing, manufacturing and corporate communications while Mr. Sculley focused on research and development."
11/6/1990	Sit Up and Do Tricks	COMPLETELY unscientific research has determined that the Apple Macintosh is more fun to use than a standard PC, and it is going to get a lot more amusing with Stupid Mac Tricks, a new book and disk combination from Bob (Dr. Macintosh) Levitus. Stupid Mac Tricks ($19.95 from the Addison-Wesley Publishing Company of Reading, Mass.) is a compendium of 14 silly, nonproductive, sophomoric and in some cases essential programs that can be loaded into a Mac -- yours or your designated victim's.
10/23/1990	Preview of a Coming Attraction	"OF the three new Macintosh computers recently introduced by Apple Computer Inc., the sleek Mac LC is perhaps the most intriguing. It is also the least visible, since Apple does not plan to make it available until late January. The new Mac Classic has a low price, but it lacks color, processing power and expandability; the Mac IIsi has all of these but its price is above the reach of many people in home offices or schools. The new LC falls in a happy middle ground as Apple's lowest-priced color Macintosh. It is also the most radical departure from conventional Macintosh design, with a low, slim profile that resembles a high-tech pizza box. A Mac LC equipped with two megabytes of system memory, a 1.44-megabyte diskette """"superdrive"""" and a 40-megabyte hard disk drive will have a list price of $2,499. List prices for Apple products are typically discounted 25 percent to 30 percent at retail, so one can expect to pay less than $1,800 for the LC. The price includes a keyboard and mouse but not a monitor. With Apple's 12-inch color monitor, the street price would still typically be less than $2,400, making the LC an extremely attractive alternative to comparably powered 386SX PC's. Apple also introduced a new color monitor last week, the 12-inch RGB Display. At $599, the new color monitor is $400 less expensive than Apple's slightly larger 13-inch color display. The tradeoff is that the resolution of the 12-inch display -- the number of picture elements, or pixels, on screen -- is 512 dots horizontally by 384 vertically, as against 640 by 480 on the 13-inch model, so the 12-inch color model can display 36 percent less information. On the other hand, the new monitor looks pretty good, unless one is accustomed to the sharper 13-inch model. And for the money, many people may decide that the extra pixels are unnecessary. If they change their minds, the Mac LC works with the 13-inch color monitor. It will not work with larger monitors without an optional video adapter. So, for a discounted cost of less than $3,000, one can have a Macintosh system that is almost equivalent to the original Mac II color system, which sold for more than $6,500. The LC uses the same 16-megahertz version of the Motorola 68020 chip used in the original Mac II back in 1987. Apple almost certainly chose to use the older 68020 chip to keep costs down and to keep the Mac LC from eating into sales of the more powerful (and profitable) Mac II family, but it sacrificed some power in doing so. People who need more power will probably prefer the new 68030-based Mac IIsi or its more powerful siblings, the IIci and the IIfx. Home and school users, meanwhile, are likely to find the Mac LC more than sufficient. Apple officials said that the Mac LC has twice the performance of the Mac SE. Potentially more significant is Apple's assertion that the Mac LC outperforms I.B.M.-style PC's based on the very popular Intel 386SX 16-MHz microprocessor. We have seen no independent benchmark tests to confirm or dispute this, but technical specifications alone are not enough to determine the better computer. Unless the potential customer has a substantial investment in DOS-based software, the Mac LC will probably win a lot of people away from the 386SX machines. The Mac is much easier to set up and operate than standard PC's. If price and performance are roughly equal, as they appear to be, the Mac LC wins the contest simply because it is less aggravating to use. Apple is developing a new plug-in card to let the Mac LC run software written for the Apple IIe in addition to its own Macintosh software. The price for the card, due in March, has been set at $199. The Apple II family has been a mainstay in education for more than a decade, but it has now been overtaken by the march of technology. It is to Apple's credit that it has provided a bridge from the old technology to the new, instead of expecting its users to leap to a new standard."
10/21/1990	Looking for Growth in the Domestic Market	LEAD: At Mr. Micro, a three-store personal computer chain in Dallas, sales of the International Business Machine Corporation's sharp new PS/1 home computer have been brisk.

6/23/1990	Sales Officer For Apple Unit	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said today that Michael L. Dionne had been named vice president, sales, of the Apple U.S.A. division, effective immediately.
6/12/1990	News From the Macintosh Front	LEAD: SO much attention has recently been paid to Windows 3.0, a program that makes Compaq and compatible computers work in much the same fashion as Apple Computer's Macintosh, that some Macintosh owners are becoming testy. Via old-fashioned paper mail, electronic mail, voice mail and fax modem, they complain that the accolades rightfully belong to the original, not to the imitation.
5/29/1990	Using the Familiar Macintosh For Literary Purposes	LEAD: WRITENOW version 2.2 is a lean and mean word-processing program for the Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh. It has all the features needed to create simple documents and many of the features needed to create more complex ones, and it zips right along.
5/25/1990	Adobe Expects Lower Profits	LEAD: Adobe Systems Inc., which supplies software that controls laser printers, said its revenues and earnings in its second quarter would be sharply lower than anticipated, largely because of a decline in sales to Apple Computer Inc., its largest customer.
5/15/1990	Apple Says Xerox Claim Is Dismissed	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said the Xerox Corporation's one remaining claim in a copyright suit filed in December had been dismissed.

4/22/1990	The Executive Computer;   The Power Culture Elbows In at Macworld	LEAD: Tens of thousands of Apple Macintosh users visited the Macworld trade exposition here earlier this month, examining the hardware and software on offer. But unlike the Macworld shows of a couple of years ago, when people in blue jeans and polo shirts came to look at Apple's small and relatively underpowered computer family, this year's show attracted what appeared to be an unusually high percentage of corporate users.
4/19/1990	Apple's Profits Rebound on Strong Foreign Sales	LEAD: Driven by strong international sales, Apple Computer Inc. today reported unexpectedly strong sales and earnings for its second quarter. The Cupertino, Calif., company had notified analysts on March 15 that results would be better than expected after a disappointing previous quarter, but today's numbers exceeded even the most bullish of revised estimates.
4/17/1990	Looking at Life From Both Sides	LEAD: At first glance, the Radius Pivot monitor seems to be just another gimmick.

12/18/1987	Apple Optimistic	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said it expected record revenues and earnings for its first fiscal quarter, which ends Jan. 1. Analysts have estimated the earnings at between 65 and 85 cents a share, with revenues between $925 million and $980 million. In the comparable period last year, Apple earned 45.5 cents a share, after an adjustment for a 2-for-1 split, on revenues of $662.3 million.
12/6/1987	Keeping on Top of All Those Details	LEAD: HERE at Mission Control we use a Rolodex file to keep track of sources and telephone numbers. We use a small pocket diary and a larger desk calendar to keep track of appointments and meetings. We keep track of expenses on slips of paper that we stuff into pockets or desk drawers, to be gathered and added up later with a pocket calculator.
11/22/1987	For Mac Owners With Wanderlust	LEAD: PORTABLE computers are an increasingly common sight on airliners these days. Even so, I was amused on a recent flight to see a businessman sitting nearby hugging an Apple Macintosh to his chest like a baby. He was still hugging it and smiling vacantly as he wandered off the plane.
11/17/1987	A Sincere Form of Flattery	LEAD: Until recently I.B.M. and Apple, the big two of personal computers, have turned out models that were as different as a utilitarian Volvo and a sporty Porsche. Now, they risk becoming as alike as a Pontiac and a Chevy.
11/8/1987	PIED PIPER ON THE COMPUTER	LEAD: IT WAS A SUNNY afternoon in Los Angeles, and the researchers at Alan Kay's computer lab were outside on the playground, shrieking their way through recess. Inside, in the art room of a rather down-at-the-heels elementary school in West Hollywood, a group of local technologists - people from the University of California at Los Angeles, the Rand Corporation, the International Business Machines Corporation, Pacific Telesis, the Times Mirror Company - were gathered around Formica-topped tables to hear Kay talk.
10/22/1987	Apple Investment Post	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would broaden its strategic investment activity to potential acquisitions of public or privately held companies.

Eilers to vice president of strategic investments, a new position; as director of strategic investments he has been responsible for the company's venture capital efforts.
10/15/1987	Apple's Profits Surge on Sales of New Products	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc., benefiting from strong sales of new products and the rebound in the personal computer industry, today reported substantial gains in net income and revenues for its fourth-fiscal quarter and the fiscal year.
10/10/1987	New Borland Unit	LEAD: Borland International Inc., a personal computer software company based in Scotts Valley, Calif., said it had formed a division to develop, produce and market software for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Borland said the division, which will be managed by Ron Posner, vice president, sales, will cooperate closely with Apple on distributed data base and office-systems products using Apple's data communications technology.
9/4/1987	Ashton-Tate Ships Macintosh dBase	LEAD: The Ashton-Tate Corporation said it has begun shipping the long-awaited dBase Mac program, a version of its industry-standard data base management software for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. This is Ashton-Tate's first product for the Macintosh and the first truly powerful data base program for that popular computer, although releases from competitors are imminent.
8/30/1987	Apple Invades I.B.M.'s Domain	LEAD: WALK into any major corporation and check the computers used there. The latest market surveys find that 85 percent of them are I.B.M. PC's or I.B.M. compatibles. That's hardly a surprise.
8/25/1987	Sybase President Gains The Confidence of Apple	LEAD: Mark Hoffman, president of Sybase Inc., believes that future computing will consist of many high-powered work stations linked in networks, which would have the ability to gain access to large data bases. That belief gained a vote of confidence yesterday, when Apple Computer Inc. announced that it was making a minority investment in the Berkeley,
8/18/1987	It's, Well, HyperCard	LEAD: IN 1983, Bill Atkinson introduced his MacPaint program for the Apple Macintosh, and it forever changed the way people think about personal computers. Here he goes again. At the Macworld Expo here last week, Mr. Atkinson unveiled HyperCard. It is software for the Apple Macintosh, but beyond that no one is quite sure what to call it.
8/11/1987	Apple to Introduce Unusual Software	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. will introduce an unusual database and management information program Tuesday that the company hopes will help it maintain its lead in technology for making computers easy to use.
7/24/1987	Apple to Introduce Software Products	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. will introduce two significant software products next month, the company's chairman, John Sculley, told securities analysts. While he did not name the products, one is expected to be internal operating system software that would allow a Macintosh computer to handle several tasks at once.
7/15/1987	Apple Opposes A Toshiba Ban	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would suffer financially and competitively in the home computer market if proposed legislation banning imports of Toshiba Corporation products and those of its subsidiaries were adopted by Congress.
7/14/1987	Apple Net Up by 66% In Quarter	LEAD: Buoyed by strong acceptance of its new products, Apple Computer Inc. today reported sharply increased sales and earnings for its third quarter ended June 26. The gains exceeded both the estimates of the company and analysts.
7/10/1987	New Apple Unit	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said that its new software subsidiary would be named the Claris Corporation, reflecting ''clarity and distinctiveness.'' Apple said in April that it planned to spin off its software sales effort into an independent company in which it would retain a minority stake.
6/9/1987	Apple Names Sales Executive	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had promoted Charles M. Boesenberg to senior vice president and group executive, United States sales and marketing. Mr. Boesenberg, 38 years old, succeeds William V. Campbell, who in April was named president of Apple's new applications software subsidiary.
5/10/1987	DRESSING UP ROUTINE PAPERWORK	LEAD: WITH its new PS/2 series of computers, I.B.M. is beaming its spotlight on large corporations. Indeed, the new line would seem to be the opening act in a drama whose logical finale is a business environment in which everything is hooked up to, or at least able to communicate with, I.B.M.'s big mainframe computers.
5/5/1987	A FASTER WAY TO PAINT	LEAD: WHEN I began reviewing a new graphics package for the Macintosh last week only to discover that the publisher had sneaked advertisements for other products onto the program disk, I was incensed at the liberties taken with the bits and bytes consumers are expected to pay for.
4/30/1987	Key Apple Officer Will Head Spinoff	LEAD: William V. Campbell was the first executive recruited by John Sculley after he joined Apple Computer Inc., and as executive vice president for sales and marketing he has been said to epitomize the chief executive's teamwork approach. Soon Mr. Campbell will start assembling his own team. On Tuesday,
4/29/1987	Apple to Spin Off Software Business	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. plans to spin off a company that will develop, publish and sell software for Apple personal computers, the company said today.
4/26/1987	BUGGY WHIPS OF THE INFORMATION AGE	LEAD: THE skunk cabbage was peeking through last year's matted brown leaves and coltsfoot bloomed in the meadow. In the space of 24 hours, nature had shrugged off winter and announced that, yes, finally spring had arrived. This was no day to hang around computers. Better to go riding. I popped off to the tack shop to replace a broken set of reins neglected over the dreary winter months.
4/23/1987	Apple Declares Quarterly Payout	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif., declared its first quarterly cash dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split to shareholders of record on May 15. Apple declared a cash dividend of 12 cents a share on a pre-split basis for the quarter ended March 27, with the issuance of the new shares and payment of the dividend both scheduled for
4/20/1987	Apple's Software Chief Shifts to New Program	LEAD: Guy Kawasaki joined Apple Computer Inc. in 1983, when the Macintosh personal computer was still perceived by software developers as innovative, but too slow and lacking in power to appeal to business users. His job as self-described ''software evangelist'' was to ''use fervor and zeal to convince developers'' to write programs for the new machine.
4/16/1987	Apple Net Up 6.6%	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc., aided by the strong sales of its new Macintosh SE computer, recorded surprisingly high sales and earnings in its second fiscal quarter ended March 27.
4/8/1987	Apple Shifts Managers	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. today announced management changes that the company said would ''broaden the breadth and depth of Apple's executive leadership.''
3/10/1987	MACINTOSH SE: THE APPLE EVOLVES	LEAD: OF the two new Macintosh computers introduced by Apple last week, the flashy, powerful Mac II attracted the most attention. Yet it is the other model, the Mac SE, that is expected to attract the most buyers.
3/2/1987	APPLE'S 2 NEW MACINTOSHES	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. will introduce two Macintosh models on Monday that will usher in a new generation of technology for personal computers and serve as the basis for the company's growth for years to come.
3/2/1987	VYING TO ENHANCE THE MACINTOSH	LEAD: A few years ago, three engineers took out second mortgages on their homes and formed a company to make circuit boards that plugged into an I.B.M. personal computer, increasing the machine's memory and capability. The company, AST Research Inc., now has annual revenues of $170 million.
2/6/1987	HIGH TECH'S GLAMOUR FADES FOR SOME VENTURE CAPITALISTS	LEAD: The venture capital industry, which has nurtured the growth of hundreds of high-technology companies such as Apple Computer, Genentech and Lotus Development, is shifting its focus to more mundane investments that have little to do with technological innovation or creating new jobs.
1/31/1987	COMPUTER VENTURE CONFIRMED BY PEROT	LEAD: H. Ross Perot, founder of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, confirmed today that he had invested $20 million for a 16 percent stake and a board seat in Next Inc., the start-up company formed by Apple Computer Inc.'s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs.
1/29/1987	New Apple Devices For Business Users	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc., in the first of a barrage of product announcements scheduled for the next few months, introduced two devices today aimed at gaining greater acceptance of its Macintosh computer with business customers.
1/25/1987	The In Crowd Is Watching Apple	LEAD: I.B.M. watching, long a leading sport in Silicon Valley, consists in large measure of following Big Blue's every move with an eye toward making a few million dollars here or there by producing cloned or compatible products. The International Business Machines Corporation, meanwhile, zigzags through the marketplace trying to avoid giving the competition any clues concerning the destiny of computing.
1/21/1987	APPLE UP	LEAD: Wang Laboratories, citing inventory write-downs, problems in plant consolidations and sluggish sales, said yesterday that it had a loss of $78.6 million in the second fiscal quarter, ended Dec. 31.
1/13/1987	New Apple IIe Is Introduced	LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. today introduced an updated version of the Apple IIe personal computer that has as features an expanded keyboard with a built-in numeric keypad, improved training materials and the company's new platinum color scheme.
1/11/1987	THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER	LEAD: WITH the release last year of the Macintosh Plus, it looks as if Apple is beginning to make real inroads on business computing. The current dominance of the I.B.M. standard has thrust into virtual oblivion the fact that brokers, insurance agents and financial analysts snapped up the original Apple II to computerize their work on their own individual machines.
1/6/1987	Ziff Buys MacUser	LEAD: The Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, a subsidiary of the Ziff Corporation, has acquired MacUser magazine, a publication for owners of Apple Computer's Macintosh. Peter Godfrey, chairman, and Felix Dennis, publisher, will continue to work at the magazine they founded. The acquisition brings Ziff-Davis's computer magazines to seven.
12/18/1986	Chief Sells Holding In Apple Computer	John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., sold nearly all of his Apple shares last month, according to information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Sculley sold 107,503 shares, or about 97 percent of his holdings, at $39.81, the reports said. Barbara Krause, an Apple spokesman, said it was company policy not to comment on executives' private financial decisions but added that Mr. Sculley retains 392,497 options to purchase Apple shares at an exercise price of $16.85.
11/4/1986	A WAY WITH WORDS	THE early Apple Macintosh was cute. It had a great personality, it was easy to get to know, and its little mouse was lots of fun to play with. But could a serious writer have a meaningful relationship with it? The Mac was feebleminded, with 128,000 characters of internal memory and one dinky disk drive that was excruciatingly slow. Hooking up a letter-quality printer was a task for Rube Goldberg. The screen was too small. The keyboard lacked cursor and function keys, and the mouse kept demanding that the writer take one hand away from the keyboard. MacWrite, the word-processing software that came with the Mac, was outclassed by word processors available for the I.B.M. PC.
10/15/1986	STRONG GAIN POSTED BY APPLE	Buoyed by increased acceptance among business users and continued strength in educational sales, Apple Computer Inc. today reported a 46.9 percent increase in earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 26. For all of the fiscal year 1986, the company's net income more than doubled from depressed results of the previous year. Another company in the computer business, Honeywell Inc., said yesterday that its quarterly profits were hurt by the slump in capital spending and fell nearly 42 percent.
10/10/1986	Delays Seen for Apple Model	Apple Computer Inc. appears to be experiencing delays in shipping its new II GS personal computer. Dealers say they got demonstration units for the model's Sept. 27 introduction but do not expect to receive any inventory before next month.
10/7/1986	Advertising; Apple Returns To Screen	TO make sure that it is noticed when it returns to television after a year's absence, Apple Computer has had its new agency produce 11 commercials using the talents of three top directors and about $6 million for production. The advertising is scheduled to break Oct. 18 during the World Series coverage on NBC. And, since the Cupertino, Calif., company will be aiming different ads at different audiences - men, women and children, in business, education and the home - it will be buying time during sports, news-oriented and family-type prime-time programming. Sundays especially will be Apple time. The commercials were shown here yesterday at a news conference presided over by John Sculley, chairman, president and chief executive of Apple. There was particular interest from the advertising community since it was something of an Apple debut for Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, which had won the domestic account in competition with Chiat/ Day, a producer of award-winning work for Apple.
9/16/1986	Apple Price Cuts	Apple Computer Inc. said that it was lowering prices for its Macintosh computers and Laserwriter printer.
9/15/1986	FOR APPLE, REBOUND AND NEW COMPUTER	Only a year ago, the once high-flying Apple Computer Inc. seemed to have crashed to earth, its top executives feuding bitterly as their empire collapsed around them. Now, Apple is staging a recovery. Late last year, the company's profits began to rise, due not to sales growth but to layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. A few months ago, sales began to climb, as the company's Macintosh computer finally caught on with corporate customers. Today, in a local auditorium, Apple will introduce the Apple IIGS, a powerful computer that is expected to breathe new life into the nearly 10-year-old Apple II line.
9/7/1986	Why Greenspan Stumped for Apple	LAST year, from March through July, Apple Computer ran a series of TV and print ads focusing on two ''achievers'' who used Apple computers. For one of those achievers, the connection to Apple was clear-cut - she was Barbara Blackborn, a secretary who set the world speed typing record on an Apple IIc. But the other was Alan Greenspan, who did not even own an Apple computer before the commercial aired. (The company gave him one afterward). From Apple's point of view he provided ''name value and believability,'' says Bruce S. Mowery, the company's advertising and sales promotion manager. And from Mr. Greenspan's vantage point, the Apple commercials provided a chance to do ''something different from what you do day-to-day,'' as well as an opportunity to shoot jibes at politicians and Government economists.
8/12/1986	Bridge: New Instructional Program For Apple II Is Being Shown	A quantum leap in the technique of bridge instruction was provided last year by Random House. Advanced students who loaded the company's ''Tournament Bridge'' program onto a personal computer found themselves forced to rely on skill: luck would never save them. The first version was for I.B.M.'s and compatibles. The second, for the Apple II, is to be demonstrated at 5 P.M. today at the Beverly Club, at 130 East 57th Street.
8/11/1986	Ashton-Tate 'Mac' System	Ashton-Tate, the leading vendor of data management programs for personal computers, will introduce on Monday its first product for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computer. The product, known as dBase Mac, will be a database management system priced at $495 and available in the fourth quarter of the year.
7/29/1986	Chief of Operations Appointed at Apple	Delbert W. Yocam took time out from water-skiing yesterday to be promoted to executive vice president and chief operating officer of Apple Computer Inc. Mr. Yocam, who joined Apple in 1979, was taking a six-week sabbatical with his family at Lake Tahoe when he moved up from being executive vice president and group executive of product operations. Mr. Yocam, who is 42 years old, is sometimes credited as the architect of the reorganization of Apple, which over the last year has consolidated the previously separate Apple II and Macintosh divisions. He has also been instrumental in decreasing inventory and instituting cost controls, which raised margins and put the company solidly back in the black. ''He has been running the company's internals since the reorganization,'' said Michael Murphy, editor of the Technology Stock Letter.
7/7/1986	Behind the Computer Magic, Young Brains	The displays included a computer game and a computer program that teaches differential calculus, and the whizzes that proudly stood before these exhibits included two fifth graders from Wellesley, Mass., and a recent high school graduate from St. Paul. The event was a high-technology show-and-tell by the winners of an annual competition sponsored by Apple Computer Inc. The 22 winners and runners-up were chosen for their outstanding computer projects in the areas of community service, basic programming, integrating computers into a schools curriculum, and general achievement. The winners got free computers and software as well as a trip to Washington, including tours of the White House, the monuments and the Smithsonian Institution. Apple, based in California, sponsored the competition for the more than 10,000 computer clubs it has around the world. The clubs are designed to encourage student achievement in different aspects of computer use. Most of them are affiliated with schools, according to Apple.
6/29/1986	APPLE SNAPS BACK	What a difference a year makes. Last June, Apple Computer Inc. was in the doghouse. Sales of all models were slow, and a management dispute between chairman John Sculley and co-founder Steven P. Jobs over the company's future led to Mr. Jobs's departure.
6/3/1986	Education Venture By Apple, 2 Others	Apple Computer Inc. said that it had entered into a technical collaboration with the National Geographic Society and Lucasfilm Ltd. to explore the use of optical technologies such as videodisks and compact disks in education. Apple said the effort would explore ways to use the immense storage capabilities of optical media to bring together text, film, video, audio and software to provide teachers with new ways to deliver information. In March, Apple's former chairman, Steven P. Jobs, acquired a majority of Pixar, Lucasfilm's computer graphics division. Mr. Jobs's other new company, Next Inc., is developing a sophisticated computer work station for the educational market.
5/21/1986	Advertising; B.B.D.O. Gets Apple Computer	BATTEN, BARTON, DURSTINE & OSBORN has won the shootout with Chiat/Day for the domestic business of Apple Computer, reported to bill $50 million. So ends a two-and-a-half-month confrontation in which the strategic thinking and actual advertising of both agencies on an assigned project were evaluated by the agency. In both areas, said Bruce Mowery, advertising and sales promotion manager, B.B.D.O. ''seems to be most appropriate for the direction we will be taking in the future.
5/13/1986	Apple Founder To Get Degree	Steve Wozniak, who built the first Apple computer in his garage and became a multimillionaire as Apple Computer Inc. grew into one of the world's leading high-technology companies, will finally receive a college degree this Saturday. Mr. Wozniak, who is 35 years old, will get a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California at Berkeley, where he first enrolled in 1971.
4/24/1986	Apple Sees Strong Earnings	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it expects continued strong earnings for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 26. The company also said it had increased its expenditures on marketing and product development.
4/17/1986	TANDY CLIMBS BY 91.8%	Apple Computer Inc. reported today that earnings more than tripled in the second quarter ended March 28. Separately, the Tandy Corporation, based in Fort Worth, announced improved earnings, though analysts said the increase was not as great as had been expected. Apple earned $31.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $10 million, or 16 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Sales, declined by 6.1 percent, to $408.9 million, from $435.3 million in the period a year ago.
4/7/1986	APPLE TO ELIMINATE 600 OF ITS DEALERS	Apple Computer Inc. is cutting off 600 dealers, a move that will reduce the number of stores authorized to carry Apple products in the United States by about 23 percent. The cuts were announced in letters mailed out last Thursday to the affected dealers. Before the cuts, Apple had 2,600 dealers. Apple's move is the latest by computer makers to help shore up dealers, who are going through a shakeout caused by a slowdown in growth in computer sales and an overabundance of computer stores. Computer manufacturers are becoming concerned that if the dealers are not healthy, the manufacturers will also be hurt in the long run.
4/1/1986	Lotus Cuts Price Of Jazz Software	The Lotus Development Corporation, trying to revive sales of its faltering Jazz program for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, said it would lower the software's list price to $395, from $595.
3/23/1986	FINALLY, DESKTOP SOFTWARE FOR APPLES	DESKTOP accessory programs have been with us for a couple of years now. They offer computer users instant access to an on-screen calculator, notepad, appointment calendar and maybe an automatic telephone dialer or even a complete telecommunications package - without ever having to exit from the task at hand, be it word processing or working on the maze of a spreadsheet. The most popular of the desktoppers is no doubt Borland International's Sidekick, but there is a plethora of others, almost all of them aimed at the I.B.M. PC market. A version of Sidekick is available for the Macintosh, which is a bit ironic in view of the fact that the Mac's user-friendly operating system started the entire ''desktop'' approach. For some reason, Apple has never taken advantage of the bandwagon it so innovatively started.
3/15/1986	Co-founder Sells More Apple Stock	Steven P. Jobs, co-founder and former chairman of Apple Computer Inc., has sold another 885,000 shares in the company. The sales occurred between Feb. 3 and Feb. 24 for prices from $22.79 to $25.25, according to reports of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Jobs could not be reached for comment on the sale, and it was unclear how many shares he still owns. After losing a power struggle last summer with John Sculley, who he had originally hired away from Pepsico Inc. to be Apple's president, Mr. Jobs left the company and started a new venture called Next.
2/20/1986	Apple Buys Loan On Computercraft	In an unusual move, Apple Computer Inc. has helped bail out a computer store chain by purchasing a loan from a bank. The chain, Computercraft Inc. of Houston, is one of the biggest supporters of Apple among computer retailers, with Apple products accounting for about half of the chain's sales.
2/11/1986	THE 'PLUS' IN MACINTOSH	IT is time to burrow through the mound of mail that accumulated during the busy Groundhog Day week. From Apple Apple writes to say that its new Macintosh Plus is now in the stores, and not a minute too soon, either, since the company is already making plans to introduce another new Macintosh in the fall. Not counting the Lisa, which was rechristened the XL shortly before its demise, these mark the third and fourth incarnations of the computer. At first glance the Macintosh Plus has no extra chrome or tail fins to distinguish it from its prececessors, and it uses the same microprocessor chip. The big changes are inside. The Plus comes with one megabyte of random access memory, twice as much as 512K, and Apple says it will be able to handle 4 megabytes when more powerful computer chips become available. For now, the full megabyte capacity means the computer can use more powerful software, and use it more quickly. The built-in disk drive has been replaced with a double-sided model that can store 800K per disk, a much-needed improvement. The keyboard has also been modified to add cursor control keys and a separate numeric keypad.
1/30/1986	Apple Names Its Chairman	Apple Computer Inc. today named its president and chief executive, John Sculley, to the additional title of chairman.
1/18/1986	Steven Jobs Settles Suit Filed by Apple	Apple Computer Inc. and its former chairman, Steven P. Jobs, reached a settlement today in their lawsuit filed when Mr. Jobs formed his own company with other Apple employees. While both sides hailed the agreement as favorable, it does place some restrictions on Mr. Jobs and his new company, Next Inc. For example, it gives Apple the right to inspect Next products before they are marketed to determine if they contain what Apple views to be trade secrets. Next officials said the restrictions would not interfere with company plans. ''The key thing is the lawsuit was dismissed and this is just great,'' Mr. Jobs said in an interview. Apple sued Mr. Jobs in September when Mr. Jobs, after a bitter falling out with Apple's president, John Sculley, left Apple and started his own company, along with five other Apple employees. In its suit, filed in a state Superior Court in Santa Clara County, Calif., Apple charged Mr. Jobs with breach of fiduciary responsibility and with masterminding a ''nefarious'' scheme to steal Apple's trade secrets.
1/16/1986	APPLE WOOS BUSINESS MARKET	Apple Computer Inc. will announce faster and more powerful models of its Macintosh computer and Laserwriter printer on Thursday, as well as some corporate alliances intended to spur sales of the Macintosh to businesses. The arrangements include an agreement with Northern Telecom Ltd. to develop the ability to connect the Macintosh to other computers through Northern Telecom's telephone switches. Apple also plans to announce an agreement to work with the MCI Communications Corporation and Dow Jones & Company on the development of data communications and information retrieval products. In addition, Apple executives said the company planned to start a venture capital operation to invest in companies that want to develop software and other products for use with Apple computers.
1/15/1986	APPLE NET UP 23.4% TO RECORD	Apple Computer Inc. today reported a 23.4 percent gain in earnings for its first fiscal quarter, despite a 23.5 precent decline in sales. The increase brought the computer company's profits to a record, only two quarters after Apple had the first quarterly loss in its history. Earnings for the quarter, which ended Dec. 27, were $56.9 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with $46.1 million, or 75 cents a share, for the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Sales declined to $533.9 million from $698.3 million.
12/31/1985	Jobs's Apple Stake	Steven P. Jobs, the former chairman of Apple Computer Inc., has reduced his stake in Apple from 7.2 percent of its shares outstanding to 5.6 percent. Mr. Jobs did not disclose details on the sale of one million Apple common shares in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Jobs resigned in September after a dispute with Apple's board.
12/19/1985	APPLE SEES RECORD NET IN QUARTER	Apple Computer Inc., in an announcement that surprised Wall Street, said today that it expects record earnings in the current quarter, despite a drop in revenues. Apple said it expects net income for its first fiscal quarter, which ends Dec. 27, to be about $52 million, or 85 cents a share, up 13 percent from $46 million, or 75 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Analysts had been expecting earnings this quarter of about 50 cents to 60 cents a share, so the announcement sent Apple stock soaring in heavy trading. Apple, traded over the counter, closed at $22.125, up $1.50 a share, with almost 2.5 million shares changing hands.
11/30/1985	WOZNIAK BUYS APPLE STOCK	Apple Computer Inc. said today that Stephen Wozniak, the company's co-founder, had bought $5 million worth of Apple stock and announced plans to buy as much as $15 million more. Shares in the personal computer company, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., closed today at $20, unchanged from Wednesday, in over-the-counter trading.
11/9/1985	DIGITAL PLANS I.B.M. LINKAGE	The Digital Equipment Corporation said yesterday that it plans to introduce an I.B.M.-compatible personal computer, leaving Apple Computer Inc. as the sole American computer maker that has not adopted the I.B.M. architecture. Digital's chief executive, Kenneth H. Olsen, confirmed the company's plan at the company's annual meeting in Boston.
11/5/1985	APPLE WILL INTEGRATE PRODUCTS	Apple Computer Inc., saying that it had regained its footing after the most tumultuous year in its history, outlined a plan yesterday to integrate its products in an ''I.B.M.-defined world'' of computer systems. The company said the move marked a broad refocusing that some Apple officials conceded would concentrate less on flashy new technologies and more on making machines attractive to businesses. In a presentation to Wall Street analysts late yesterday, Apple also predicted that its restructuring earlier this year would allow the company to post ''significantly stronger'' earnings in the fiscal year 1986 than in 1985. ''I think that the big news is that Apple is doing far better today than many people, even people inside Apple, thought possible five months ago,'' John Sculley, Apple's chief executive, said in an interview yesterday. ''We're a lot more pragmatic today.''
11/1/1985	Apple Products	Apple Computer Inc., hoping to bolster sales of computers to corporations, plans to introduce products in the next 3 to 18 months to allow its Macintosh computers to tie into networks of computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation. In a speech in Dallas Wednesday, later released by the company, Apple's president, John Sculley, said that products were being developed to allow data and text from the Macintosh to be sent to I.B.M. mainframes and to communicate with other larger machines through I.B.M.'s System Network Architecture.
10/22/1985	QUEST IN NETWORKING: SOFTWARE	WORD processing is supposed to turn writing from a chore into a pleasure. Spreadsheets permit an almost infinite juggling of numerical data in a trial-and-error search for the best solution to quantifiable problems. The benefits of a database manager are a little more difficult to define. ''Personalized electronic organization'' might come close to covering the concept, except that most computerized databases are shared by several users, or at least were meant to be.
10/15/1985	I.B.M. ADDS 10 MEGABYTES TO NEW AT	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES has rolled out a new model of its most powerful personal computer, the AT. The new version comes with a 30-megabyte hard disk, able to store 30 million characters of information, 10 million more than previous models. This means the new AT can store the equivalent of a few more James Michener novels than the 20-megabyte (20-MB) version. In addition, a second 30-MB hard disk can be installed in the new AT for users with truly Texas-sized storage needs. The new AT, which will be arriving in I.B.M. product centers this month, also comes with 512 kilobytes of random access memory and a high-density (1.2-MB) floppy disk drive. It has a list price of $5,995, just $200 more than the older 20-MB model, which was bedeviled by cantankerous hard disks from the start.
10/8/1985	APPLE GIVES ITS MACINTOSH A HARD DISK	APPLE has finally introduced its own hard disk drive for the Macintosh, the aptly named Hard Disk 20 (it holds 20 megabytes - 20 million characters - of data, roughly the equivalent of 12,000 double-spaced, typewritten pages). That may seem a lot, but hard disks work just like attics: as more space becomes available, more junk materializes to fill it. The need for such storage space for the Macintosh was recognized long ago by everyone except Apple, it seems, and about a dozen brands of hard disks for the Macintosh are now on the market. So, Apple is in the odd position of hopping on its own bandwagon.
10/2/1985	Apple Cuts Prices On All Computers	Apple Computer Inc. cut the prices on all of its computers by roughly 10 percent to 25 percent and discontinued the lowest-priced version of its Macintosh computer.
10/1/1985	Digital Research To Modify GEM	Digital Research Inc. of Monterey, Calif., said that it would modify its GEM operating systems programs to avoid claims by Apple Computer Inc. that the programs violate Apple's copyrights.
10/1/1985	OVERHAUL OF THE APPLE II: IT'S MORE LIKE A MACINTOSH	APPLE has just introduced a bushel of new peripherals that make the Apple II more like a Macintosh. The Apple II product line is getting its first major overhaul in years, gaining an external 3 1/2-inch disk drive, an add-on board that can increase the IIe's memory eightfold to more than a megabyte, and software that mimics the Macintosh's cute little icons and happily cluttered ''desktop,'' allowing the user to work on several projects at one time. Small Disk Drive The Apple II is ripe for the $499 disk drive, called Unidisk. The most obvious difference between Unidisk and the existing built-in and external disk drives is size. Although smaller than the standard 5 1/4-inch disk drives now used by Apple and most other computers, the 3 1/2-inch Unidisk can store 800,000 characters (800K) of data on each disk - 400,000 per side, like a tiny phonograph record - in contrast to the maximum 143,000 for the existing Apple drives.
9/25/1985	Jobs Calls Apple Suit 'a Shock'	Steven P. Jobs, the former chairman of Apple Inc. said today that a lawsuit Apple filed against him over his attempt to set up a new computer company was ''absurd and a shock.'' He said he had offered to agree in writing that his new company would not hire masses of Apple employees or use Apple's proprietary technology. The suit, filed Monday, accused him of misappropriating Apple secrets and of breaching his fiduciary responsibility by plotting to form a new company and recruiting selected employees while still the chairman of Apple's board of directors. Mr. Jobs resigned as chairman last week after the dispute broke out. To defend himself, Mr. Jobs today called reporters to his spacious but sparsely furnished mansion in the hills south of San Francisco. ''When someone calls you a thief publicly, there's just a time to say something,'' he said.
9/24/1985	Apple Sues Ex-Chief Over Computer Venture	Apple Computer Inc. today filed suit against its former chairman, Steven P. Jobs, in connection with his attempts to set up a new computer company staffed by five former Apple employees. The suit, which had been threatened by Apple for more than a week, also names Richard A. Page, one of the five Apple employees who resigned from the company to join Mr. Jobs in his new venture. Mr. Jobs is charged with breach of fiduciary responsibilities, threatened breaches of contract and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information.
9/24/1985	LINKING MAC TO THE I.B.M. PC	IF the field of personal computing seems somewhat confused and disoriented, then the dichotomy between the I.B.M. and Apple Macintosh operating systems seems downright schizophrenic. Had the automobile industry developed both left-hand and right-hand drive cars, with separate roads for each, the situation would be roughly analogous to that now existing in the realm of personal computer operating systems. More than just those two operating systems are at odds: CP/M is still in use in older Kaypros, ProDOS in the Apple II's, and Unix, Xenix and half a dozen other 'ix's. But the real confrontation is between PC-DOS, the I.B.M. standard developed by Microsoft, and the Mac's. These two take opposite tacks to the ''user interface,'' the means by which one gets the machine to do what is wanted.
9/19/1985	APPLE COMPUTER ENTREPRENEUR'S RISE AND FALL	In his years of guiding Apple Computer Inc., Steven P. Jobs had become the epitome of the American entrepreneur, a symbol of the wealth and power that can arise almost overnight in California's Silicon Valley. Even President Reagan, in a recent address, urged the nation's youth to ''follow in the footsteps of those two college students who launched one of America's great computer firms from the garage behind their house.'' The tale of Mr. Jobs's visionary leadership at Apple came to a bitter end on Tuesday when he resigned as the company's chairman after disclosure of his plans to start a new company. A Prominent Salesman Mr. Jobs has been the most prominent salesman of the personal computer revolution, preaching that the new technology would change everyone's lives. And just as Mr. Jobs is falling, the revolution he foretold is stalling: Consumers and businesses are slowing their purchases of computers and questioning how much they really need the machines.
9/17/1985	Apple Review Of Chairman	Steven P. Jobs, chairman and co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., has recruited five Apple employees to join him in forming a new company, he told Apple last week. As a result, the Apple board is reviewing his status with the company, a spokesman said.
9/10/1985	Better Outlook Seen by Apple	Apple Computer Inc. expects Christmas sales to be strong this year and has increased its advertising budget somewhat, the company said today. The remarks appeared to be more optimistic than predictions made in late July by the company. Apple officials also indicated that the company expects to be profitable in the current quarter, which ends Sept. 30.
9/7/1985	Ailing Franklin's New Computer	The Franklin Computer Corporation, which filed for reorganization under Federal bankruptcy laws last year, introduced a new personal computer that is compatible with Apple Computer Inc.'s machines. Until now, no company has been able to make a computer compatible with Apple's software, Morton E. David, Franklin's chairman and chief executive, said.
8/30/1985	Apple Founder Cutting Stake	Steven Jobs, chairman of Apple Computer Inc. and one of its founders, intends to sell 500,000 Apple common shares, further lowering his stake in the personal computer company. The sale, valued at $7.4 million, raises the number of Apple shares sold by Mr. Jobs since July to 1.3 million. Mr. Jobs disclosed his plans in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
8/20/1985	Apple Computer Selling a Factory	Apple Computer Inc. plans to sell a factory that makes keyboards and ''mice'' for its Macintosh computer to the Alps Group, a Japanese company that now supplies Apple with disk drives and other components.
8/13/1985	Software Transforms Apple IIe Into a Typewriter	WHEN you get right down to the core of the matter, what sets the Apple IIe apart from most other personal computers is that it's just plain fun. First introduced eight years ago, by microelectronic standards it is an antiquated technology. But the IIe still has a lot to offer those who already own one. Unlike the later IIc, whose closed system precludes the add-on boards that popularized the Apple computers, the IIe invites curiosity and exploration. There's always one more accessory you can buy to help turn the machine into ''The Endless Apple,'' as Charles Rubin entitled his book for Apple enthusiasts.
8/11/1985	PUMPING UP MACINTOSH'S MEMORY	ONE of the amusing facets of writing a review column is that with a little skill and luck one can quite often achieve that happy state wherein almost all readers agree - that the columnist is wrong. Whenever I write about the Macintosh, I try to balance the machine's faults against its strengths, watching carefully for my own prejudices. Invariably, on such occasions, I receive letters from Macintosh radicals accusing me of being a true-blue I.B.M.'er who simply does not understand the marvel that Apple has created. I receive an equal number of missives from I.B.M. fanatics, who are convinced that I am an Apple spokesman who has been taken in by the Macintosh's fancy graphics and now is simply incapable of understanding how far superior to the Mac I.B.M.'s computers are.
8/6/1985	Stock Quotes Via Macintosh	Apple Computer Inc. will cooperate in marketing a new service to deliver stock and commodity quotes and other financial information to users of its Macintosh computer. The service will be announced next week by Bonneville Telecommunications, a subsidiary of the Bonneville International Corporation, a radio and television station owner in Salt Lake City.
8/3/1985	Stock Sale by Apple Founder	Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder and chairman of Apple Computer Inc., is selling about one-eighth of his Apple holdings, raising further questions about his future with the company. In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Mr. Jobs said he planned to sell 850,000 shares for about $14 million.
7/21/1985	MAKING MACINTOSH MORE VERSATILE	APPLE Computer's travails in the microcomputer marketplace seem to continue unabated. Over the last couple of years, the company appears to have surrendered the small-business market as well as the so-called home market by neglecting any true development of its classic Apple II series. Instead, Apple has focused on the Macintosh office in an attempt to become a supplier to large corporations. The Macintosh is a truly innovative machine. And now, with a hard disk finally available for it from HyperDrive, it is an innovative business machine as well. At least it would be if someone would market a decent replacement keyboard. But the Mac's place is still largely limited to art departments and small businesses. Without I.B.M. compatibility, or at least the ability to exchange information with Big Blue's PC's, the Macintosh is doomed to remain isolated. It remains, in fact, isolated even from its brothers. The Macintosh still has no file server, a device that allocates files and time on the hard disk, allowing more than one machine to use its information at the same time. The file server is a ''Macpromise'' that is taking a long time to be realized, and unless one appears this year, Apple may find itself locked out of the very market it covets.
7/19/1985	APPLE COMPUTER POSTS A LOSS OF $17.2 MILLION	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it lost $17.2 million in its third fiscal quarter, the first quarterly loss for the personal computer pioneer since it incorporated in 1977. The loss resulted from a one-time charge against earnings of $40.3 million, owing to the recently announced consolidation of the company that includes the closing of three of the company's six factories and the dismissal of 1,200 of its 5,800 employees. Apple said that its pretax profits from operations for the quarter, which ended June 28, were $3.5 million. In the third fiscal quarter a year ago, Apple had pretax operating profit of $28.3 million and net income of $18.3 million. Revenue for the quarter dropped 11.2 percent, to $374.9 million, from $422.1 a year earlier.
7/16/1985	Some Ins and Outs of Modems	MODEMS - the devices that allow computers to talk to one another over regular telephone lines - come in internal and external versions. While both versions do essentially the same job, each has advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it is to be used. External modems are about the size of a paperback book and sit on the desk as a separate, or stand-alone, unit connected to the computer's serial port with a standard RS-232C cable and to a power outlet by a cord.
7/14/1985	INTEGRATED SOFTWARE FOR THE THIN MAN	IN the battle for the Macintosh's mind raging among the purveyors of integrated software, Ensemble may have been first, but not, it turns out, the program with the most. Jazz, a new competitor from the Lotus Development Corporation, has more features, but it lacks a macro facility, which allows users to accomplish with one or two keystrokes what normally would require a dozen. Considering that Lotus's research indicates that most users of its best-selling 1-2-3 program take advantage of this feature, the omission is amazing. There is also Excel, from the Microsoft Corporation, which hopes to become the favorite integrated package for the Mac - once it is released. Owners of the 128K Macintosh do not have much of a vested interest in the fray, however, since neither the Lotus nor the Microsoft program will run on their so-called Thin Macs. That makes Ensemble ($299.95 for the Apple Macintosh with 128K of memory from Hayden Software, Lowell, Mass., 01853, (617) 937-0200) the only integrated software product available for users of this machine.
6/27/1985	APPLE SEEKS SUPPLIER LINKS	Apple Computer Inc. wants to increase ties with outside software and hardware suppliers in an effort to quickly increase the versatility of its Macintosh computer, Apple's president and chief executive, John Sculley, said here today. Mr. Sculley, making his first public remarks since Apple's sweeping layoffs and corporate restructuring, also said the company would rely more heavily on dealers to sell its products and abandon most of its direct sales efforts. ''We want to actively build bridges - starting now - with other companies,'' said Mr. Sculley, who spoke at an industry conference on the Macintosh, organized by Future Computing Inc., a market research concern.
6/15/1985	LOSS SEEN	Apple Computer Inc., battling a fierce downturn in personal computers as well as problems in its own ranks, said yesterday that it was laying off 1,200 employees, more than a fifth of its work force. In a terse statement from John Sculley, president and chief executive, who consolidated his position atop the company in a reorganization two weeks ago, Apple also said that it expected a loss from write-offs in its third quarter, ending in June. Apple spokesmen said they could not estimate the size of the loss, but sources close to the company predicted that the pretax write-offs could total as much as $30 million, giving the company an after-tax loss of $12 million to $18 million. Last quarter, the company earned $10 million, on sales of $435.3 million. ''We expect these steps to significantly reduce the break-even point of the company,'' Mr. Sculley said in the statement.
6/1/1985	THE RESTRUCTURING OF APPLE COMPUTER	Apple Computer Inc. took a giant step today in the painful transition from its entrepreneurial origins to the ranks of more conventionally managed multibillion-dollar companies. In a move aimed both at streamlining Apple and moving it out of the shadow of its co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, the company announced a corporate restructuring that does away with its two separate product divisions, in favor of manufacturing and marketing divisions responsible for all Apple products. The restructuring eliminates the day-to-day operating responsibilities of Mr. Jobs, who had been general manager of the Macintosh division. Mr. Jobs will remain only as chairman of the board, and will take what the company called a ''more global role'' in product development and strategy formulation. Apple insiders and analysts saw the move as an urgent attempt by John Sculley, president and chief executive, to assert leadership at a time when the company is beset with numerous problems. There is a growing feeling on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley that Mr. Sculley, who was recruited two years ago from Pepsico Inc., must act soon to turn the company around.
5/31/1985	RESTRUCTURE OF APPLE HELD NEAR	Apple Computer Inc. will announce a major restructuring of the corporation Friday in an effort to streamline its operations and cope with rapidly declining sales a source close to the company said late today. The reorganization will eliminate the two separate product groups in Apple, the Macintosh and Apple II groups, the source said. They will be replaced by a division in charge of manufacturing and product development for all Apple products and another division in charge of sales and marketing of all products. There will also be a separate An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the report.
5/30/1985	Apple Accord With China	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it had reached an agreement to sell personal computers to China, with shipments expected to begin in four to six months. The company, which did not estimate how many sales it expects in China, said it would be allowed to ship both its Apple II computers and the more powerful Macintosh models.
5/28/1985	Apple to Curtail Direct Sales to Corporations	Apple Computer Inc. plans to abandon most of its efforts to sell computers directly to large corporations, officials said this weekend. Eight of the 60 people in Apple's national accounts sales force, which sold to the largest companies in the nation, have been assigned to selling computers to the educational market.
5/25/1985	PROFIT DROP EXPECTED BY APPLE	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it expects its revenues and earnings for the current quarter to drop below levels of the last quarter and below the expectations of Wall Street analysts. The company also suggested that further layoffs and product consolidations were in store. Apple had previously said it was experiencing sluggish sales, but this was the first statement it has made about earnings. It indicated the situation was worse than most analysts had thought.
5/23/1985	Apple Is Closing San Jose Unit	Apple Computer Inc. has decided to close its disk-drive manufacturing operations in San Jose and has laid off 80 employees who worked there, a company spokesman said today. The 80 employees had been making hard disk drives for the now discontinued Lisa computer, and had been scheduled to produce a future hard disk drive for the Macintosh, as well as an electronic filing system, known as a file server.
5/21/1985	Takeover Talk About Apple	SINCE its start in 1976, Apple Computer Inc. has reveled in its role as the most independent company in a valley of free spirits. Its cutoffs-and-T-shirts approach to computer design, in fact, has become one of its greatest selling points against the staid International Business Machines Corporation, Apple's nemesis. Suddenly, though, Apple's independence seems threatened. Both Wall Street and Silicon Valley have been aflame with rumors in recent weeks that Apple is a takeover target. That seems an unlikely, though not impossible, prospect to most industry insiders.
5/15/1985	Layoffs at Apple	Apple Computer Inc. said it would lay off about 100 employees at its Carrollton, Tex., plant, near Dallas, where the now-canceled Macintosh XL computer was made.
5/3/1985	Microsoft Develops Program for Apple	The Microsoft Corporation yesterday introduced a spreadsheet program for the Apple Macintosh 512 computer, in a move that Apple Computer Inc. hopes will increase sagging sales. The new program, called Excel, combines a spreadsheet, a graphics package and a data base in a single program.
4/22/1985	1ST QUARTER EARNINGS LACKLUSTER	Corporate profits in the first quarter, mirroring the weak 1.3 percent economic growth rate figure released by the Commerce Department last week, generally appear to be disappointing, according to economists. ''Earnings are not shaping up to be anything close to robust at all,'' said Robert A. Gough, a senior vice president at Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm. ''Earnings in toto will probably be flat for the first quarter.'' Analysts said the weakness in profit growth for the first three months of the year was not unexpected in light of the surprisingly low 1.3 percent annualized growth rate in the nation's gross national product - the total output of goods and services - reported by the Government for the first quarter last Thursday. It was the smallest increase in G.N.P. since the recovery began in late 1982.
4/17/1985	APPLE INCOME INCREASES 9.9% IN LATEST PERIOD	Apple Computer Inc. reported today that net income for its March quarter rose 9.9 percent on a 45 percent increase in revenues. Two United States makers of mainframes, the Burroughs Corporation and Honeywell Inc., reported gains in sales and earnings for the first quarter. Apple said net income for its second fiscal quarter, ended March 29, was $10 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with $9.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the corresponding 1984 quarter. Sales rose to $435.3 million, from $300.1 million.
3/14/1985	APPLE APPOINTS FINANCIAL OFFICER	Apple Computer Inc. yesterday named David J. Barram, an executive at a small Silicon Valley enterprise, to be its chief financial officer. For the last two years, Mr. Barram has served as chief financial officer and vice president of finance and administration at Silicon Graphics Inc., a technical graphics company that designs and manufactures high-performance work stations. A privately held company, Silicon Graphics was formed almost three years ago. Thus far, the company has had $20 million in sales. Last year, Apple reported sales of $1.5 billion.
3/12/1985	CONSUMERS BENEFIT FROM UPHEAVAL IN SOFTWARE	SOFTWARE publishing is undergoing some major upheavals, the most publicized one being the collapse of many companies, even such major ones as VisiCorp. From the consumer's point of view, however, the biggest change is the emergence of a number of companies producing a stream of software that is relatively inexpensive, often innovative and has a reputation for consistency of quality. Three such concerns come immediately to mind: Borland International, publisher of Turbo Pascal and Sidekick; Software Publishing, noted for its easy-to-use and almost foolproof small-business programs, and Broderbund, a game originator now broadening its scope to include such other entertainment packages as Print Shop, which permits the combination of printed graphics and texts for making one's own greeting cards, posters and similar missives. One of the most recent programs from this last concern is Dazzle Draw (for the Apple IIe or IIc, $59.95 from Broderbund Software, San Rafael, Calif. 94903, telephone 414 479-1170). Dazzle Draw provides Apple II owners with a MacPaint lookalike that will run on their machines.
3/12/1985	FEAR OF DISK DATA LOSS SPURS INTEREST IN TAPES	EVER since International Business Machines introduced the high-performance PC AT desktop computer last August, rumors have been growing that there are troubles with the model's 20-megabyte fixed disk. Some AT owners - far from a majority but enough to make everyone else nervous - have complained to various trade publications that the fixed disk needs to be fixed. They report maladies ranging from a creeping ''cancer'' that slowly eats its way through data across a few sectors of the disk, to crashes that wipe out megabytes of information at once. Because a fully souped-up AT with twin fixed disks can store a total of 40 million bytes (40 megabytes) of data, equal to 20,000 double-spaced typewritten pages or the equivalent of a good-sized company's payroll records, for example, such a crash could be catastrophic.
3/8/1985	APPLE SETS OUTPUT HALT FOR WEEK	Apple Computer Inc. said today that it would close its four factories for a week because of an oversupply of computers brought about by sluggish sales. It is the first time that fast- growing Apple has ever had to shut down production. Company officials said inventories of computers had built up as a result of sluggish sales affecting the entire computer industry. But some analysts and other industry officials said Apple appeared to be hit worse than some of its competitors.
2/8/1985	COMPUTER IMPORTS SOUGHT BY SOVIETS	The Soviet Union is negotiating to buy large numbers of Western-made personal computers, including Apple and I.B.M. models, according to industry sources. The computers are apparently for use in scientific institutes and schools. The move marks the first time the Russians have sought personal computers from Western nations and Japan in the open market. It is possible because of recently liberalized high-technology trade rules that went into effect five weeks ago.
2/7/1985	BUSINESS PEOPLE ;   Apple Co-founder Leaving Company	Stephen Wozniak, the brilliant and erratic computer whiz who with Steven P. Jobs founded Apple Computer Inc. in a garage in 1976, announced yesterday that he intends to leave Apple to start up a home video products company. ''I've been really into computers for 10 years, and that's a long time,'' Mr. Wozniak said in an interview. ''I don't know many people who stay with the same thing that long.''
1/25/1985	Apple Settles Lawsuit	Apple Computer Inc. will pay an undisclosed sum to Management and Computer Services Inc. to settle a trademark-infringement lawsuit, the companies said today. The software company sued Apple for using ''Mac'' to describe items associated with its Macintosh personal computer. Management and Computer Services uses ''Macs'' as a trademark.
1/24/1985	G.E.-APPLE DEAL	The General Electric Company said it and Apple Computer Inc. are offering a new telecommunications service called Applelink, a prototype for a commercial version to be called Dealertalk. The company said Dealertalk, scheduled for commercial availability early in the second quarter, would use Apples's Macintosh personal computer as an intelligent work station linked to G.E.'s worldwide telecommunications network. The system would allow communications between companies and dealers or distributors.
1/18/1985	New Apple ComputerGets Super Bowl Debut	Just as Apple used last year's Super Bowl telecast for a block-busting $500,000, 60-second commercial to introduce its Macintosh computer, it will use Sunday's Super Bowl for another super-commercial to introduce its new business computer.
1/7/1985	ATARI TAKES ON APPLE'S MACINTOSH	A slimmed-down Atari Corporation this weekend introduced its first of a new line of powerful home computers. The machines, shown at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show here, are similar to Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh model, but less than a third of the price. Unlike the Macintosh, however, which is sold exclusively in computer specialty stores, Atari said it would rely on mass merchandisers such as K Mart, Toys ''R'' Us and Dayton Hudson's Target chain - already marketers of the least-expensive home computers - to sell the more powerful systems. Analysts consider the strategy one of many risks Atari is taking with the machines, because the sales staff at such discount stores are usually not trained in the complexities of sophisticated computers. Further, Atari's computers will not use the programs designed for the popular Macintosh.
12/14/1984	G.E.-Apple Deal	The General Electric Information Services Company and Apple Computer Inc. have reached an agreement under which the General Electric unit would resell Apple's products.
11/22/1984	APPLE'S MAC TAKING ON I.B.M.	When Steven P. Jobs, the brash and free-wheeling 29-year-old chairman f Apple Computer Inc., appeared before the top data processing executives of some of the nation's largest corporations earlier this year, it seemed likely to be the ultimate clash of cultures. ''I was afraid to have him here, frankly,'' said Naomi Seligman, senior partner of the Research Board, a low-profile New York group composed of chief data processing executives of 50 of the nation's largest corporations. These customers are ''the slickest, toughest, most critical large users,'' she said. ''I've seen them eat even some I.B.M. corporate vice presidents for lunch.'' But Mr. Jobs came through his ordeal with flying colors. ''They have never been as impressed with any single individual,'' Mrs. Seligman said. Since then, she said, Apple has received a few orders, still not publicly announced, that are worth millions of dollars apiece.
11/13/1984	Lotus Software For Macintosh	The Lotus Development Corporation, as expected, introduced a software product that Apple Computer Inc. is counting on to help it sell its Macintosh machine to large corporations. Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a leading supplier of personal computer programs.
11/13/1984	A LESSON IN LOGIC TAUGHT BY A ROBOT	'' MOVE on to the eye and activate the robot's periscope.'' ''Bring that extra energy crystal along. I always bring everything with me. Don't drop it there. I want a neat and orderly robot.'' ''Can't we pick up two crystals at once?'' ''No.'' ''Hey, look, you can hide an object inside the robot and the sensor doesn't detect it.'' ''You need to split it with a nor-gate there.'' This conversation between my two daughters, punctuated with clicks and clacks of computer keys, whileanother leftover Halloween goody was consumped, would have been unimaginable between a couple of kids 10 and 13 years old a mere five years ago. Yet here were Tanya and Genevieve, the latter a self-proclaimed computer dyslexic, wholly absorbed in the task of designing a robot.
11/10/1984	Lotus Software for Apple Expected	The Lotus Development Corporation is expected to announce on Monday a business-oriented software package for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh personal computer. The move would likely add momentum to Macintosh sales, especially to businesses, analysts said. The package is expected to be similar to the integrated package, called Symphony, that Lotus introduced last summer as the sequel to its first integrated package, known as 1-2-3, several analysts said.
11/7/1984	Advertising; Apple and Newsweek Special	THE characteristics that might be best remembered about the super-colossal display of Apple Macintosh advertising that will dominate the special Newsweek Election issue could well be its classy graphics and, given the topic, its delightful sense of humor. As the only advertiser in the news weekly's first special issue outside its 50th anniversary celebration, Apple Computer had its longtime agency, Chiat/Day, Los Angeles, create 39 pages of advertising that showcase not only the single product but also the talents of the agency. The inside front cover spread serves as an introduction to the ad opus with a picture of the computer, whose screen explains that just as Election Day demonstrated the one- person, one-vote principle, the advertising to follow is ''going to demonstate the principle of democracy as it applies to technology. One person, one computer.''
10/26/1984	Coast Suspect Is Held In Threat to Ferraro	An employee of Apple Computer Inc. was arrested today and charged with threatening to shoot Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, when she visited the company's headquarters in Cupertino this morning. Larry Charon, 36 years old, was arrainged before United States Magistrate F. J. Woelflen in San Francisco and ordered to appear in San Jose next Thursday for bail setting.
10/19/1984	Apple's Profit Bounds Back SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 18	Apple Computer Inc. said today that its latest three- month profit soared sixfold from last year's depressed level. Sales jumped 75 percent.
10/3/1984	Fake Apple Computers Lead to Indictment of 2	An indictment was unsealed yesterday charging two Silicon Valley computer importers with smuggling counterfeit Apple computers into the country, according to the United States Attorney's office in San Francisco. The indictment, handed up Sept. 25, appears to mark the first time that Federal officials have brought criminal charges for violations of the copyright code. Until now, virtually every copyright action has taken the form of a civil suit, in which the copyright holder seeks damages for infringements.
9/11/1984	I.B.M., APPLE UPGRADE MODLES	The International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. announced major improvements for their personal computers yesterday. Industry analysts said the improvements would heighten the competition between the two companies in the low-cost, desktop computer market. ''Anytime these two companies change their personal computers, particularly in graphics, you see the competition pick up,'' said Sanford J. Garrett, a technology analyst at Paine Webber Inc.
8/19/1984	THE COMPUTER GIFT...	ON parents' night last October, the principal of a California elementary school rolled a newly donated Apple computer into the hallway for all to see. Moms and dads smiled approvingly as the principal wondered in silent panic, ''What are we going to do with one computer and 700 kids?'' The question was on the minds of thousands of California educators last year after Apple Computer Inc. gave away $21 million worth of computers and equipment in exchange for state-approved tax breaks. Nearly every public and private school in California - 9,250 of them - received a free Apple IIe between August and October of last year. California's Legislature approved the program, the only one in the nation, in 1983 after Federal legislation proposing to give away a free computer to every school in the country failed to pass the Senate in late 1982.
7/10/1984	APPLE TO INCREASE MACINTOSH OUTPUT	Apple Computer Inc. plans to double the manufacturing capacity for its new and highly successful Macintosh computers by the end of this year, its president said yesterday. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., introduced the Macintosh in January, and dealers say that demand has far exceeded supply. Although Apple would not say how many of the computers it was actually making, it said it is now capable of producing about 40,000 a month. John Sculley, Apple's president, discussed the company's plans at the National Computer Conference in Las Vegas, Nev.
6/8/1984	I.B.M. CUTS PRICES ON PC LINE	In a move to step up pressure on competitors, the International Business Machines Corporation yesterday announced deep price cuts on its entire Personal Computer line, including its troubled PCjr home computer. The reductions, which have long been expected in the industry, range from 18 percent to about 23 percent. The computer giant, whose three- year-old Personal Computer has become an industry standard, also quadrupled the amount of internal memory it offers with its entry-level models - making even the most basic machines capable of running some of the most popular and increasingly complex software packages. But it did not announce any changes in the much-criticized design of the PCjr, which has floundered since its introduction in January.
5/3/1984	Key Atari Scientist Switches to Apple	Alan Kay, the chief scientist at Atari Inc. and the key figure in Atari's effort to regain prominence in the home computer market, resigned to take a top research post at Apple Computer Inc., Apple said yesterday. Mr. Kay is considered one of the leading scientists in the computer field. While at the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970's he led a team that developed what many consider to be the first personal computer, incorporating many of the concepts now being used for the first time in second-generation computers made by Apple and other major manufacturers. Considered Blow to Atari Analysts said Mr. Kay's defection was a sharp blow to Atari, a unit of Warner Communications. Some said it could impair the company's ability to meet its stated goal of developing an entirely new kind of computer that home users would regard as a needed ''appliance,'' rather than as a toy or a sophisticated typewriter.
4/27/1984	Peachtree Shows Line	Peachtree Software, the microcomputer division of Management Science America, introduced 26 products yesterday that are designed primarily for computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. Analysts said it may have been the largest single line of microcomputer programs announced. Included were those for accounting, education, word processing and communications.
4/24/1984	APPLE IS BANKING ON NEW PORTABLE: THE IIC COMPUTER	Apple Computer Inc. is introducing the portable version of its successful Apple II family of computers Tuesday - the portable IIc - before 3,500 dealers in an elaborate, daylong extravaganza in San Francisco. It is no routine event. The flourishes and razzle-dazzle at Moscone Center, including dinner music by the jazz artist Herbie Hancock, were orchestrated by Apple's president and chief executive, John Sculley. It also signals the wind-up of a yearlong dash by the company, beginning with Mr. Sculley's arrival last May 3, to convince the investment community and consumers generally that Apple can be an effective competitor against the industry's aggressive giant, the International Business Machines Corporation.
4/17/1984	TANDY ADVANCES 9.1%	Apple Computer Inc., spending heavily to produce and market a new line of personal computers, today reported a 61.9 percent decline in net income for its second fiscal quarter. The company said, however, that sales jumped 31.6 percent, as demand for its IIe computer, which retails for $1,295, remained strong. John Sculley, chief executive, said Apple was unable to keep up with demand for the IIe. Alexander Stein, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., put the unit sales at more than 100,000 a month.
4/9/1984	APPLE PLANS PORTABLE COMPUTER	DAVID E. SANGER In two weeks Apple Computer Inc. plans to introduce a briefcase-size, battery-operated version of its popular Apple IIe that analysts say could pose a significant challenge to the International Business Machine Corporation's PCjr home computer. The new Apple IIc, the company's first portable computer, will be shown to the public on April 24 in San Francisco. Its introduction, at a base price of $1,295, marks the second major product announcement by Apple in three months aimed directly at I.B.M.'s growing share of the personal computer market; the Macintosh, Apple's powerful and so far highly successful entry against the I.B.M. Personal Computer, was brought out in late January. ''It's going to get exciting,'' said Lissa Morganthaler, an analyst for Woodman, Kirkpatrick and Gilbreath. ''I.B.M. is really going to have to sit up and pay attention.'' The Apple announcement comes at a time when I.B.M.'s PCjr is reported to be off to a rocky start, with many dealers saying that consumers are finding the machine too expensive and, with its small keyboard and limited ability to run other I.B.M. programs, awkward to use.
3/25/1984	NEW PLANTS MAY NOT MEAN NEW JOBS	IN Fremont, Calif., Apple Computer Inc. just opened a new factory that could be a flagship for high-technology manufacturing in this country. The plant manufactures the Macintosh, perhaps the hottest consumer-oriented computer since International Business Machines unveiled its Personal Computer in 1981. Apple hopes that half a million Macintoshes will spill from the $20 million facility by the end of the year, and if early orders are any indication, the estimate may be conservative. Best of all, notes Apple's co-founder, Steve Jobs, ''this is a machine that is made in America,'' a theme he repeated time and again as he took a promotional Macintosh road show around the country a few months ago.
3/1/1984	Apple Is Sued By 3 Holders	Three shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. have sued the company, charging that some Apple executives reaped $84 million from sales of their own shares before the price of Apple's stock plunged last fall.
3/1/1984	Advertising; The Birth Of Apple's Ad Insert	THE ad campaign for Apple Computer's new Macintosh model, especially the outstanding 20- page magazine insert, has received some high marks from some aficionados of the language. But more important, it has had a major impact on consumers, and a rush to buy is reported. The insert is winning praise because it makes the workings of the Macintosh understandable and really does create a desire for ownership. The person largely responsible for the insert is Penny Kapousouz, a 31-year- old, Glen Cove, L.I., native. For most of the last seven years, she has worked in the Los Angeles office of Chiat/Day, Apple's agency since it began advertising.
2/29/1984	IMPORT BAN ON APPLE IMITATIONS	The United States International Trade Commission ruled unanimously yesterday that nearly two dozen manufacturers in Asia had infringed on patents and copyrights held by the Apple Computer Inc., and it banned the foreign companies from exporting the imitation Apple machines to the United States. The commission said that within two weeks, it would issue an ''exclusionary order'' with details of the decision. Before the order takes effect, President Reagan will have 60 days to accept or alter it. Yesterday's ruling was another major victory for Apple and other computer makers that have been fighting imitators, both foreign and domestic. In September, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the Franklin Computer Corporation of New Jersey had violated Apple's copyrights on computer programs known as operating systems, which are etched on a computer's circuitry.
2/27/1984	BRITISH RACE IS ON IN MICROCOMPUTERS	Just as in the United States, leading computer companies in Britain are homing in on the booming microcomputer market. In the process, solid homegrown competitors, several of which hope to become high-volume international players, are confronting the American companies. The center of attention is the lucrative business segment for personal computers. Sinclair Research Ltd., a world leader in inexpensive home computers, is about to enter the fray with its first business computer, the unabashedly named Quantam Leap.
2/25/1984	STRONG SALES SEEN IN '84 FOR APPLE'S MACINTOSH	More than 600 business computer buyers put Apple Computer Inc.'s new Macintosh through its paces at a trade show here this week. After 40 minutes on the machine, Robert Dieter, an executive of the Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of San Diego, was still not sure which microcomputer maker would get the big order he expects to place for Home Federal's 160 branches. But, he said, ''Whatever it is has to be easy to use, and this is easy to use.'' And he added, ''I'm impressed.''
1/26/1984	Apple Pirates Sentenced TAIPEI, Taiwan, Jan. 25 (UPI) - The owners of six local companies were sentenced to eight months in prison for illegally reproducing computer software designs developed by Apple Computer Inc. of the United States, a court source said. The source, who declined to be identified, said the defendants were the first convicted in Taiwan of pirating Apple computer software.	Taiwan's current copyright law safeguards the legal rights of publications, but does not specifically cover computer software programs.
1/25/1984	APPLE IS EXPECTING REBOUND IN PROFITS	Apple Computer Inc. expects its profits to begin rising again ''by the end of the year,'' John Sculley, president and chief executive, said today. Mr. Sculley's projection drew cheers from many in the crowd of 2,500 shareholders at the annual meeting here. The company is counting heavily on a cluster of four new computers, including the much-discussed Macintosh personal computer, which it formally introduced at the meeting.
1/23/1984	The Other Superbowl: I.B.M. vs. Apple	Yesterday's Super Bowl telecast marked the opening of a far bigger competition than a mere football tussle: International Business Machines vs. Apple for dominance in the personal computer market.
1/23/1984	FOR APPLE, A RISKY ASSAULT ON I.B.M.	When Apple Computer Inc. introduces its long-awaited Macintosh computer tomorrow, it may represent the last serious assault on the dominance of the International Business Machines Corporation in the personal computer industry. The Macintosh, unlike many personal computers introduced over the past year, is completely incompatible with the I.B.M. Personal Computer. Thus, it is a gamble for Apple because many of the most widely used computer programs on the market are designed for the I.B.M. machine. ''They are taking an awesome risk,'' said David Lawrence, an analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''The bottom line is 'Can you establish an alternative to I.B.M.?' ''
1/20/1984	COMPUTER MAKERS PURSUING CAMPUS SALES AND RESEARCH	The leading manufacturers of personal computers are offering sharp discounts on their machines and multimillion-dollar research contracts as part of an aggressive effort to achieve prominent roles on the nation's major campuses. The companies, including Apple Computer Inc., the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation, are competing both for the loyalties of the newest generation of potential computer users and for the talents of some of the world's leading computer science research laboratories. ''Universities are not the biggest market, or the most profitable,'' said Robert F. Trocchi, product group manager for educational computing systems at Digital Equipment. ''But they are a microcosm of the entire computing world, and success there increases our chances of success everywhere.'' Under more than a score of special deals worked out in the last few months, students at such leading schools as Stanford, Harvard, Dartmouth and Michigan can now buy some of the most sophisticated desktop computers at half price, or less.
1/16/1984	APPLE EXPANDS PRODUCT LINE	One year ago Apple Computer Inc. hoped to dazzle the computer world with a revolutionary new machine called Lisa that was said to be the key to the company's future. But Lisa turned out to be a poor seller, and Apple's earnings and its leadership in the personal computer market crumpled under an attack from the International Business Machines Corporation. Now Apple is preparing to try again with another new machine called Macintosh, which will be introduced at the company's annual meeting on Jan. 24. The stakes for Apple are even higher now, especially if it wants to remain a force in the computer business. It is Apple's third and probably last chance to reduce its dependence on its Apple II line, which is nearly seven years old. Macintosh, which is expected to sell for $2,500, is only part of Apple's strategy. The company is also announcing newer, faster versions of its Lisa with an entry price as low as $3,500. And later in the year the company is expected to announce two new versions of its Apple IIe and to push that product more strongly into the home market.
1/5/1984	FRANKLIN AND APPLE SETTLE SUIT	The Franklin Computer Corporation agreed yesterday to pay Apple Computer $2.5 million in damages for copying crucial elements of Apple's most popular personal computer. The settlement marks a victory for computer manufacturers battling inexpensive copies of their own designs. Franklin, a privately held company based in Cherry Hill, N.J., also agreed to stop marketing an operating system that it admitted was a copy of an Apple design. Such systems tell a computer how to store and retrieve data.
11/8/1983	APPLE SEES FLAT PROFIT OUTLOOK	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that its earnings in the next two quarters probably would not improve from the 8 cents a share reported for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30. That was down sharply from 32 cents a share a year earlier. John Sculley, the president of Apple, made this earnings forecast in an address to securities analysts. After two quarters, he said, Apple expects a ''gradual return of margins to our traditional level about a year from now.''
10/1/1983	Apple Planning To Aid Customers	Apple Computer Inc. has agreed to help hundreds of customers who bought Apple machines at discounts from a retailer that has since filed for protection under Federal bankruptcy laws and can not deliver its orders. The Van Nuys dealership, Compuplus, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of Federal Bankruptcy Laws last March.
9/25/1983	INSURANCE FOR THE INDUSTRY'S FUTURE	EARLIER this month, a Federal appeals court in Philadelphia delivered a landmark ruling that may have saved the future of the United States computer software industry. In a case brought by the Apple Computer Company against the Franklin Computer Corporation, in which Apple sought to stop Franklin from copying two of its popular models, the court decided that all computer software, whether it appears on a floppy diskette or is etched into the silicon chips deep inside a computer, is protected by United States copyright laws. It was a landmark decision for the protection of intellectual property. And the court wisely cut through the technical jargon that Franklin had introduced to make the case seem more complicated than it was.
9/24/1983	Apple's Stock Tumbles 25%	Apple Computer Inc. lost a quarter of its market value in heavy trading yesterday after predicting ''sharply lower'' earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, ending Sept. 30. Apple shares fell $8.25, to $24.25 bid, in over-the-counter trading.
9/23/1983	APPLE EXPECTS BIG EARNINGS DECLINE	Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter ending Sept. 30 would be ''sharply lower'' than its earnings in that period last year. The announcement indicated that even Apple, one of the fastest-growing companies in history and a leader in the personal computer business, was severely suffering from overcrowding in that business and from the growing dominance of the International Business Machines Corporation in that market. Both those factors helped lead to the collapse of the Osborne Computer Corporation last week. Apple said the earnings drop - its first since the company went public in 1980 - resulted from flattening sales, combined with special write-offs and heavier investments needed to position the company for the future.
9/16/1983	PRICE CUTS EXPECTED AT APPLE	Apple Computer Inc. will cut by 18 percent the price of its new Lisa computer in an attempt to stimulate lagging sales of the innovative but expensive machine, industry sources said yesterday. The price of Lisa will be reduced to $8,190 from its current list price of $9,995, they said, and Apple will allow customers to buy the hardware separately without the software for $6,995. The six software programs that come with Lisa can be purchased for $1,195 as a package and the six programs plus a dot-matrix printer and printer interfacer can be purchased for $1,495. It is also believed that Apple plans to sell the programs individually for prices ranging from $195 to $395.
9/2/1983	Market PlaceVartanig G. Vartan I.B.M. 'Peanut' Affects Apple	IN the high-stakes business of personal computers, the stock of Apple Computer Inc., has provided considerable excitment for its followers. From a low of 10 3/4 last summer, shares soared to a record price of 63 1/4 this June, then plummeted to 30 on Monday of this week before regaining a measure of strength. On Wednesday, in continued heavy trading in the over-the-counter market, Apple jumped 4 3/8 points, to 37 1/4. Yesterday, it closed at 36 3/8. What has been causing such price gyrations for this Cupertino, Calif., company that was one of the ''hot new issues'' of 1980?
12/30/1980	A 'Hot' Offering Retrospective; Genentech And Apple Varied Greatly COMPANY NEWS Recent 'Hot' Issues: A Retrospective Risky but Desirable	"When Apple Computer and Genentech's initial stock offerings first came to market this year, they seemed to be the stuff of which investment bankers' dreams are made. They, and similar """"hot"""" issues, were viewed as the potential I.B.M.'s and Xeroxes of the dawning decade, and almost every knowledgeable investor, it appeared, wanted to own the shares of such high-technology companies."
12/16/1980	Apple Stock Order Reversed	BOSTON, Dec. 15 (AP)--The Massachusetts Secretary of State, Michael J. Connolly, today reversed an earlier order and allowed the publicly issued stock of Apple Computer Inc. to be sold in his state.
