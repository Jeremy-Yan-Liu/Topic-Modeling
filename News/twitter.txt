2012-07-03	Judge Orders Twitter to Turn Over Protester's Messages	Thoughts may be ephemeral, but a tweet, apparently, is forever. A Criminal Court judge in Manhattan ruled on Monday that Twitter must turn over to prosecutors messages sent by a Brooklyn writer during the Occupy Wall Street protests last fall. In doing so, the judge, Matthew A. Sciarrino Jr., indicated that although private speech was protected, the same did not apply to public comments on Twitter.

They are technology enthusiasts spread across military bases and mazelike corridors at the Pentagon. In the five years since Wired.com started its Danger Room blog, it has attracted a steady following in the national security community. The blog has 35,094 Twitter followers, makes up 10 percent of the traffic on Wired.com, and has broken stories as geeky and alarming as the one on a virus spreading through drone cockpits and ''burn pit'' trash disposal exposure in Afghanistan. Danger Room appears to be reaching readers the military sometimes has trouble connecting with in its own ranks.
2012-06-11	Twitter Finds Sleep Patterns In Four Cities	Twitter knows when you nap. At least its engineers think they have a pretty good idea when you nap, because those are the few times when you're not pouring your heart out in 140-character bursts. Peering into its fire hose of tweets from four big cities around the world, a pair of Twitter engineers, Miguel Rios and Jimmy Lin, have discovered that the Twitter users in Istanbul don't sleep much in August -- and why would they, considering how many people are strolling along Istiklal Avenue on summer evenings.

2012-05-20	All About You	Recently I tried to persuade a friend, a professional woman in her 40s, to create a Facebook account. Like many people, I'm a regular user, usually to post photos and updates of my daughter's sports and academic accomplishments -- and to keep track of friends and family. But my friend believed Facebook would drain her time. She said that if she couldn't maintain friendships in the real world, she wasn't interested in keeping up with the small details of people's lives. There has been a lot of scholarship devoted to the study of Facebook, sparking debate about the mental health and personality traits of frequent users. Most recently, research from Western Illinois University suggested, like other studies before it, that Facebook appeals to our most narcissistic tendencies. The study, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, asked 292 people to answer questions aimed at measuring how self-involved they were.
2012-05-20	Pakistan Blocks Access to Twitter Over Cartoon Contest	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The Pakistani government blocked access to the social networking service Twitter for much of Sunday, after publicly holding Twitter responsible for promoting what it described as a blasphemous cartoon contest taking place on Facebook, officials said. The restoration of Twitter service late in the evening was as sudden as its suspension earlier in the day. No official statement or explanation was given for an act that some rights campaigners saw as much as a warning shot at the media and public expression as a reaction to controversial content.

But in recent weeks, the cardinal and his office prepared for an entirely different kind of address: his first Twitter message.
2012-05-18	Books With 140 Characters	I run a book club. It's a highly democratic operation, and the members choose what books they want to read. What with varying tastes and all, building a consensus can prove challenging. That may be true of any reading group, but my predicament is unusual: this book club has, at last count, 64,483 members. I'd cite the hoary adage about herding cats, but even cats speak the same language. My readers live in Sierra Leone, Germany, Spain, Australia, China and Singapore, to name just a few far-flung countries. Oh, and we don't meet once a week to engage in high-minded literary discourse. The conversation never ends. As soon as the New Yorkers are going to sleep, the Australians are reaching for their books.

Cuomo might, in fact, have felt ''FABULOUS'' after the passage of same-sex marriage legislation last year. On Twitter, thankfully, there needn't be any doubt. While officials in City Hall and Albany use the medium to communicate judiciously -- eager to please, careful not to offend -- a band of imitators has formed a shadow Twitter government all its own, raising a funhouse mirror to the feats and foibles of New York's political class.

The guidelines do not ban teachers from using social media and, in fact, recognize that it can offer tremendous educational benefits. Nor do they address cellphones and text messaging between teachers and students, which, according to a review by The New York Times of dozens of Education Department investigations in the past five years, have been more widespread and problematic.
2012-04-30	A Little Barb At Microsoft, Remixed	Timothy D.

But, of course, the Internet overlooks nothing. When asked by an analyst about Microsoft's Windows 8, a coming operating system that blends iPad-like touch-friendly features with some of the look of a traditional computer operating system, Mr. Cook said it was possible to force the convergence of any two devices. ''You can converge a toaster and refrigerator, but these things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user,'' Mr. Cook said.

She was not hospitalized as some news outlets reported. She performed Tuesday night in Stockholm, then called off a second performance on Wednesday night after consulting with a doctor.Rihanna joins several high-profile performers who have cancelled major concerts for health reasons this year, among them Adele, who is undergoing surgery to repair bleeding in her vocal chords, Taylor Swift, who had a bout of laryngitis, and Caleb Followill, the lead singer for Kings of Leon, who cancelled half his band's tour to rest his voice.

The dominant nouns then formed their own relationships. Early Internet searching was an art. The available results were mostly useless, so you had to “refine your search” — you had to try to think like the algorithm just as the algorithm was trying to think like you. An unexpected partnership. I always thought this was why search took off: you had the vague feeling that you were working with someone else, on the path to refinement.

They found that a fairly small number of people who use Twitter generate an awful lot of the posts. As with many things Webby (e.g. Wikipedia), Twitter empowers a small set of superusers.

No user information appears to have been stolen in the attack. But the security breach -- the third major one at Twitter this year -- underscores the continuing weakness of the company's systems as its micro-blogging service is becoming more important to business and even global politics.

More plainly, his firing suggests that vulnerable publishers, under pressure as the noose on advertising-supported print seems to tighten, are willing to groom away the moguls if that's what they think the advertiser wants.

The accusation wasn't entirely off-base. In Iran and elsewhere, this year showed the growing importance of social networks to U.S. foreign policy. Long before the protests in Iran started, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. civilian international broadcasting, had in place software to counter censorship in countries like Iran, so people could better access the blogosphere. And the State Department financially supports agencies that make it easier for Iranians and others to surf the Web. After the protests began, the State Department asked Twitter to reschedule a maintenance outage so the activists could continue to spread the word about their movement.
