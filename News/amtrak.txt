The break in service, which began about 8:30 a.m., affected dozens of Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains and more than 30,000 riders, according to representatives of the railroads. The disabled train, traveling from Long Branch, N.J., was carrying about 300 passengers, who were transferred in the tunnel to a Long Island Rail Road train, a New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said. Both railroads said that normal service resumed in the afternoon and that the disruption was not expected to affect this morning’s commute.

The machines, which officials said would eventually operate in 150 stations in the nation, will replace a version that has been in service since 1999. By the end of this month, Amtrak hopes to have 19 of the blue self-service machines installed at Penn Station. Officials said the kiosks, which have brighter screens and better panels, can complete a sale in about 30 seconds, down from the 60 seconds needed on the current machines.
2007-05-15	Colorado: Train Evacuated After Bomb Talk	A long-haul Amtrak train was evacuated after passengers said they had heard a man talking about a bomb and a knife. The man, whose name was not released, was taken off the eastbound California Zephyr about 20 miles west of Denver, but was released after questioning when the F.B.I. determined he was not a threat, said Agent Rene VonderHaar. “I think that it’s one of those things that just escalated,” Ms. VonderHaar said. About 220 passengers were evacuated from the train late Sunday and taken by bus to Union Station in Denver, the train’s next scheduled stop. Passengers reboarded the train there and continued eastward, about three and a half hours after the original stop, said Marc Magliari, an Amtrak spokesman. Mr. Magliari said he did not believe that the passenger who was removed from the train had reboarded. “I believe he made alternate travel plans,” he said.

2006-10-24	Memo Pad	FIRST OF THE VERY LIGHT JETS Eclipse Aviation said it expected to deliver the first so-called very light jet as early as this week to David Crowe, the co-owner of Magnum Aviation in California. Eclipse has more than 2,500 orders for its $1.52 million Eclipse 500 jets and expects to deliver 10 of them this year and 515 in 2007. The Federal Aviation Administration has predicted that 5,000 very light jets will be operating within 10 years. Besides Eclipse, which has booked the highest number of orders, other manufacturers making their own versions of the jets include Cessna, Adam Aircraft, Embraer and Honda. Some very light jets will be used to supplement corporate fleets for short-haul trips; others are being bought by companies that expect to operate them as on-demand air taxis, and some are being bought by individuals as entry-level private jets.

For now, however, there is just a concrete platform, a bench in a plexiglass shelter and Ken Shea, who confronted a sharp wind and not much else when he stepped down from the two-car Amtrak train he takes each day from New Haven. He was on his way to welding classes at a technical school in East Windsor, across the Connecticut River from the station, where he arrives, not always on time, on the 11:11 a.m. train.

Clifford Black, an Amtrak spokesman.
2005-12-11	Congressman Adds More Vegetables to Amtrak's Load	Amtrak certainly knows how to lose money, but the railroad says it can lose less if only it can get out of the business of hauling cars of ''premium'' freight like perishables behind its cross-country trains. Instead, Congress has told Amtrak to increase sharply the number of carloads it hauls or forgo $8.3 million in additional federal money.
2005-12-06	National Briefing | Washington: New Post For Ex-Amtrak Chief	David L. Gunn, who was president of Amtrak from 2002 until he was fired by the railroad's board last month in a dispute over restructuring the company, was named as an adjunct scholar by the conservative Free Congress Foundation. Free Congress's founder, Paul M. Weyrich, is a former member of Amtrak's board and of the Amtrak Reform Council, a group chartered by Congress that called for introducing more competition in passenger rail service. Mr. Weyrich said in a statement about Mr. Gunn that ''his firing, which was engineered by the White House, was a travesty.'' David Laney, the chairman of the Amtrak board, had no comment on Mr. Gunn's new job. Matthew L. Wald (NYT)
2005-11-26	Budget Gives Amtrak Carrots, But Wields Sticks as Well	Congress was fairly generous with Amtrak in the transportation budget it passed just before it went home for Thanksgiving, but the package has some unusual strings attached. The measure, awaiting President Bush's signature, is designed to keep Amtrak in the business of hauling freight cars, which it wants to quit, and the budget, as passed, could threaten Amtrak's ability to serve meals to passengers. It would give the transportation secretary the power to raise the price Amtrak charges commuter railroads, like New Jersey Transit, for their use of the Northeast Corridor tracks, which Amtrak owns. And it seeks to limit Amtrak's ability to discount tickets and reduce the airline-style pricing that the railroad has been using.

A parade of Republicans and Democrats denounced the board for firing the president, David L. Gunn, who had earned widespread praise for stabilizing Amtrak's operations.

The concerns come as the board faces new questions about its future.
2005-11-12	The Troll On The Tracks	Amtrak's president was fired this week, which was good news for those of us who love trains and want a reformer in charge of the railroad. Yet members of Congress along the Northeast Corridor immediately denounced the firing. One obvious reason is that these politicians are indebted to Amtrak's unions, which want no part of reform. But there also seems to be a more baffling reason. Northeastern politicians actually like the railroad the way it is. After being held captive for decades by Amtrak, they're suffering from the Stockholm syndrome.
2005-11-10	Amtrak Fires Its President In Dispute Over Future	Amtrak's board fired the company's president on Wednesday morning, widening a divide between the Bush administration and Congress over the future of the railroad. The board chairman, David M. Laney, said that the president, David Gunn, helped develop a strategic plan that would have injected more competition into passenger operations, but that Mr. Gunn's ''enthusiasm and commitment seems to have drained away.''
2005-11-10	A Disgraceful Signal at Amtrak	The sudden firing by the Amtrak board of David Gunn, the best president in years of the nation's only passenger railroad, was a body blow to anybody who cares about long-range passenger trains. Mr. Gunn has done a masterly job in the last three years of holding down costs without dismantling the railroad. That, apparently, was his problem. Mr. Gunn was trying to save Amtrak, but the Bush administration wants to privatize it, bit by bit.
2005-11-06	The Last Stop Draws Near: Catching Up With the FL9	WHEN George L. Humphreys Jr. became a conductor in 1971, the first FL9 locomotives had already been in service for 14 years. Now, Mr. Humphreys and the FL9 are in the twilight of their careers, so it was fitting that he was a conductor on a special rail-fan excursion from Stamford to Canaan two weeks ago that was a farewell to the FL9. Mr. Humphreys, who plans to retire next year, has worked mainly on the Danbury branch, where the FL9's were still hauling passenger trains until about three months ago, when they were replaced by eight newer Genesis engines leased from Amtrak.
2005-10-14	Courts' Slow Recovery Begins at Train Station	The inmates, bleary from trying to sleep on a fenced-in chunk of pavement outside the bus and train station in New Orleans, parade upstairs to the makeshift courtroom, their hands in white plastic cuffs. The prosecutor hustles up from his office -- aka the Taste of New Orleans gift shop -- where his file folders now share the display window with bottles of hot sauce and plastic ladles that say ''Cooking with Jazz.'' The magistrate judge, Gerard J. Hansen, is making do behind an old desk, briskly setting bail for some of the 1,100 people arrested in the metropolitan area since Hurricane Katrina hit on Aug. 29.
2005-10-13	Free Upgrade to Amtrak Ends For Some New Jersey Riders	What may have been the best commuting bargain in America is about to disappear. For more than 20 years, some New Jersey Transit customers have been riding Amtrak's faster and more comfortable trains to and from New York City at no extra charge. But after Oct. 28, there will be no more free upgrades.
2005-10-13	Train Board Backs Shift Of Corridor	The Amtrak board has approved an essential step in the Bush administration plan to break up the railroad, voting to carve out the Northeast Corridor, the tracks between Boston and Washington, as a separate division. The board, made up entirely of Mr. Bush's appointees, voted in a meeting on Sept. 22 to create a new subsidiary to own and manage the corridor, which includes nearly all the track that Amtrak owns.
2005-10-12	National Briefing | Washington: Agreement Reached In Amtrak Case	Several engineering and construction companies have agreed to pay the federal government nearly $24.75 million to settle a dispute related to claims on some Amtrak projects, the Justice Department said. The companies were accused of overcharging Amtrak for work on a system to deliver electricity to trains along the route between New Haven and Boston. The companies involved in the matter included Balfour Beatty Construction of Atlanta, the Massachusetts Electric Construction Company of Boston and the J.F. White Contracting Company of Boston. The matter was prompted by a whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former Balfour Beatty employee, Ian Cartwright; he will receive about $3.9 million of the settlement, the Justice Department said.

2005-09-30	High-Tech Gates Fail to Avert Car-Train Crash	Before Amtrak started running its high-speed Acela Express trains in the Northeast corridor five years ago, it installed sophisticated warning systems to head off collisions with cars at grade crossings. But one of those new gates, which cost about $1 million per crossing, was not enough to prevent an accident that took the lives of two occupants of a Ford sedan in Waterford, Conn., on Wednesday morning.
2005-09-28	The Little Engine That Could	WE'VE learned a lot about evacuating cities in recent days, much of it deeply troubling. But if the failures of New Orleans and the gridlock of Houston show anything, it's that we urgently need a third way out of cities, something other than flying or driving. Fortunately, there is such a way: passenger rail. If local and federal authorities had worked with Amtrak to make better use of its trains in New Orleans, thousands could have been evacuated before the worst of Katrina hit. And if Houston had gone ahead with earlier proposals to develop high-speed rail links, the same might have been true there.
2005-09-25	Caught in a Train Delay, A Protest Takes a Detour	An electrical failure in New Jersey disrupted train service between New York and Washington for five hours yesterday morning, leading to confusion, delays and an impromptu protest outside Pennsylvania Station by antiwar activists who gave up on plans to join a larger rally in the nation's capital. Service was shut down just before 5 a.m. Vernae Graham, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, said the electrical failure occurred in Rahway when a crane accidentally dropped a beam on the wires that provided power to the trains, severing the connection.
2005-09-25	F. Y. I.	Names With a Past Q. In the Biltmore Room of Grand Central Terminal, there is an old chalkboard schedule, kept for nostalgia's sake, with the names of long-distance trains of the past, like the Yankee Clipper, the Murray Hill, the Knickerbocker and the Mohawk. Could you tell me where these trains used to go? A. Sure, but first, a romantic aside. The Biltmore Room, once connected to the Biltmore Hotel, was also called the Kissing Room because loved ones would be greeted there as they exited the long-distance trains at Grand Central on Tracks 39 through 42.
2005-09-22	Amtrak Reports Steady Ridership Despite Problems	Amtrak will end its fiscal year in a few days with ''no measurable impact on our ridership'' from the brake problem that sidelined the Acela fleet this year, the chairman of the railroad's board told Congress on Wednesday. As Congress enters the late stages of the annual subsidy dance, with Amtrak allies proclaiming that the railroad is on a starvation budget and opponents saying taxpayers are throwing good money after bad, the chairman, David M. Laney, portrayed the railroad as making progress in putting its financial house in order. But he acknowledged that major structural changes were needed.
2005-09-16	After Backlash, Amtrak Delays Fare Increase	The next time Amtrak officials decide to spring a hefty fare increase on their most loyal customers, they may want to pass along an early warning to the members of Congress among them. Their failure to do that last week fueled a backlash in Washington that forced Amtrak's chief executive, David L. Gunn, to call off a plan to raise fares on Tuesday. Amtrak said yesterday that it would postpone the increases while it takes more time to explain its plan to elected officials and riders.
2005-09-10	Amtrak Raising Fares a Bit and, if You're a Frequent Rider, a Lot	Citing the high cost of diesel fuel, Amtrak said yesterday that it would raise its train fares across most of the nation by at least 5 percent this month, but that its most frequent riders would face much steeper increases. Amtrak, which has been battling in Washington for enough federal financing to maintain its operations, said ticket prices would rise an average of $4 in the Northeast and $3 elsewhere on Sept. 20. For commuters who ride Amtrak trains daily in the Washington-Boston corridor, however, the cost will rise by up to $375 a month.
2005-09-09	Amtrak Is Said To Be Planning A Big Fare Rise For Commuters	Amtrak is preparing to announce a significant increase in fares that will push up the monthly cost of commuting for thousands of train riders in the Northeast by as much as 50 percent, according to railroad industry officials, commuter advocates and Congressional staff members. Some commuters who travel regularly on Amtrak trains between Washington and Boston said ticket agents had warned them of a pending increase that could add hundreds of dollars to the cost of their monthly passes. By yesterday afternoon, people who work on Capitol Hill said Amtrak employees had told them an announcement about a big rise in fares was imminent, probably coming next week.
2005-09-04	Father and Son, 5, Share a Journey and a Memory	WHENEVER I told someone I was taking my 5-year-old son, Dean, on the overnight train to Chicago, I heard the same words in response: ''He'll remember it for the rest of his life.'' Then I'd hear stories. Everyone, it seemed, had taken an overnight train as a child and remembered very specific details, like lights flying by the window at night, or eating in the dining car with all the plates bouncing around, or stepping out onto a station platform in the South and feeling that first press of humidity just before dawn. (The colleague who told me that last one said he could still feel the warmth of that morning if he closed his eyes.)
2005-08-04	Power Failure Halts Amtrak Between New York and Philadelphia	All Amtrak trains traveling between New York City and Philadelphia were canceled yesterday evening, inconveniencing thousands of commuters and other travelers. A train left New York shortly before midnight and a spokeswoman said reduced service would likely be restored this morning. Service was first shut down around 6:30 p.m. because of a power failure in Pennsylvania. Several electrical wires that provide power to the trains were knocked down in the area between Levittown and Grundy, Pa. Service between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. was also reduced.
2005-07-25	Penn Station Evacuated After Bomb Threat	A man who falsely claimed to have a bomb in his bag prompted the authorities to evacuate Pennsylvania Station for more than an hour yesterday, causing delays for travelers across the Northeast and punctuating a tiresome week of increased security in New York City's subway stations. During a dispute with an Amtrak ticket agent, the man, whom the police identified as Raul Claudio, 43, of the Bronx, placed a bag on a ticket counter and said a bomb was inside, the police said. The threat was unsubstantiated, but caused personnel including National Guardsmen in military fatigues to clear the station just after noon.
2005-07-24	Restoration and Repairs on Amtrak	Amtrak passengers traveling on the Empire Builder's scenic route across eight states from Chicago to Seattle and Portland, Ore., next month will enjoy renovated rail cars and new on-board services and amenities. Amtrak expects to have the renovations on the five sets of trains that operate on this route completed by Aug. 21. First-class sleeping cars are being redecorated and will have updated bathrooms and redesigned showers. The interiors of the coach, the dining cars and the lounge cars are also being refurbished for the first time since they went into service about 20 years ago.
2005-07-22	National Briefing | Washington: Acela Trains To Travel North Of New York	Amtrak plans to resume Acela Express service north of New York on Saturday, for the first time since the trains were halted on April 15 because of cracks in the brakes. The high-speed trains re-entered service between New York and Washington on July 11. Amtrak will run one Acela to Boston on Saturday and bring it back on Sunday. Beginning on Monday it will run one round-trip daily between Boston and Washington. The railroad expects to have all 20 repaired by fall. Matthew L. Wald (NYT)
2005-07-12	After 3 Months on the Shelf, Acelas Begin a Return to Service	Amtrak put two of its Acela Express trains back in service on Monday, nearly three months after all 20 were sidelined because of cracked brakes. Travelers with tickets for the 7 a.m. Metroliners northbound from Washington and southbound from New York were surprised to end up riding the Acelas instead. For now, the high-speed trains are running on the Metroliner schedules -- about 10 minutes longer, for a trip of about three hours.
2005-07-02	Train Kills Man, Tying Up Penn Station	A Long Island Rail Road train hit and killed a man last night in a railyard in Sunnyside, Queens, causing the disruption of train service into and out of Pennsylvania Station. The man, who was believed to be in his late 20's or early 30's, was struck shortly after 7 p.m. and was pronounced dead at the scene, said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
2005-06-19	Comings and Goings	Amtrak has tentative plans to resume a limited schedule of the Acela Express next month. The high-speed trains between Washington and Boston were taken out of service in April because some of the trains were found to have brake problems. The return will be gradual, with all 20 Acela trains expected back in service sometime in the fall. Because of the high cost of gasoline, 55 percent of Americans expect to drive less this summer than they would have otherwise, according to a nationwide Gallup Poll. And just under half, 46 percent, of the 1,006 adults surveyed May 20 to 22, said the price of gas would affect their vacation plans this year. Through Labor Day, a new guided walking tour of Philadelphia is escorting visitors on a mile-and-a quarter journey to 21 sites throughout the historic area of the city. The 75-minute Constitutional Walking Tour has several departures each day from the Independence Visitor Center at Sixth and Market Streets and costs $15, $12.50 for children aged 3 to 12.

2005-06-12	Amtrak: Stuck In Its Tracks	AMTRAK, it turns out, may be too sick to kill. The national passenger railroad has never managed to pay its own way, absorbing $29 billion in federal aid over its 34-year history. That has made it a perennial target for budget-cutters and fiscal conservatives, who say that what Congress cobbled together in 1971 from the fading passenger operations of the major freight railroads was not a phoenix but a Frankenstein.
2014-01-02	Beyond Brakes, Amtrak's Woes Hit the Cafe Car	Riders on Amtrak may think that the $3.25 hot dog and the $1.50 bag of chips in the cafe car are no bargain. Neither does Amtrak. It is spending just over $2 for each dollar of food it sells on its trains, according to auditors. But the financially beleaguered railroad said at a Congressional hearing on Thursday that while it could lose less, it has little hope of breaking even there.
2005-05-29	A Title That's Not As Boss as It Looks	WILLIAM SCHULZ forgives people who think he has moved up in the world when they see his business card. It now says ''chief'' where once it read ''vice president.'' But Mr. Schulz, a corporate communications official for Amtrak in Washington, was not promoted. Instead, when a new directive at the railroad reduced the number of vice presidents to 10 from about 85, Mr. Schulz wasn't considered senior enough to keep the title. So he became the chief of his department, in the process picking up the hottest title around.
2005-05-19	Repairing Rail Bridge in Kearny May Take a Year, Amtrak Says	Amtrak officials estimate that repairing the railroad bridge in Kearny, N.J., that caught fire last week will take as long as a year and cost $4.6 million, an Amtrak spokesman said yesterday. But Amtrak expects to finish fixing the tracks on the bridge within 10 days, allowing trains to resume crossing it at full speed, said the spokesman, William Schulz. Until then, Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains leaving New York City will fall a few minutes behind schedule as they slow to 30 miles per hour on the bridge, he said.
2005-05-14	Trains Crawl Back Into Service After Kearny Bridge Fire	Transit workers restored train service between New York City and Newark in time for commuters to get to work yesterday after a fire shut down a critical railroad bridge in Kearny, N.J., the night before. No one was hurt in the fire, which was ignited by a dangling electric wire, the authorities said. But a few hundred commuters were briefly stranded on the tracks in the Meadowlands of New Jersey after their westbound train became tangled with the faulty wire and lost power. Unaware that a fire was smoldering beneath the bridge they had just crossed, those riders sat in the dark as night fell, wondering what had caused the loud pop they had heard and the sparking some of them had seen.
2005-05-12	Amtrak Official Outlines Roots of Acela Problems	The Acela Express trains were far closer to a serious accident than Amtrak officials believed, with many more cracks in their brake spokes, when all 20 of the trains were abruptly taken out of service on April 15, an Amtrak official testified on Wednesday before a House subcommittee. The official, Fred E. Weiderhold Jr., the railroad's inspector general, also said for the first time that the company that manufactured the disk-and-spoke brake units had recommended their frequent inspection. But there were no regular inspections, Mr. Weiderhold said, because those instructions were ''lost in translation'' between the brake company and the consortium that built the trains.
2005-04-26	Keeping Amtrak Going	For Amtrak's 25 million riders each year, the most distressing news in recent days has been about the faltering Acela -- the high-speed train that was supposed to be Amtrak's salvation. The Acelas are now off the rails because of problems with the brakes. As The Times outlined on Sunday, the trains have been a classic Amtrak problem from the beginning, a mishmash of a design that never quite fit America's needs. But an even larger emergency is threatening Amtrak, America's coast-to-coast passenger railroad. The Bush administration is proposing to spend as little as nothing -- a big ominous zero -- to support the future of Amtrak. If Washington comes close to carrying out its threat or even stalls next year's contribution to the railroad, Amtrak could be forced into bankruptcy -- a mistake of historic proportions.
2005-04-24	Acela, Built to Be Rail's Savior, Bedevils Amtrak at Every Turn	It was called the American Flyer, and its goals were ambitious: to speed train travel between Northeastern cities, steal customers from air shuttles, provide the model for a nationwide fast rail system and help its deficit-prone parent, Amtrak, earn a profit. ''These trains will enable Amtrak to carry its customers into the 21st century aboard 21st-century trains,'' said Thomas M. Downs, Amtrak's president, at a 1996 ceremony announcing a $611 million contract for the new trains.
2005-04-23	Blame for Amtrak's Mess	"To the Editor: Re ""The Railroad to Nowhere,"" by John Tierney (column, April 19):"
2005-04-22	What's the Matter With Amtrak?	To the Editor: Re ''The Railroad to Nowhere'' (column, April 19):
2005-04-22	What's the Matter With Amtrak?	To the Editor: I agree that Amtrak did not properly research all options for high-speed trains and therefore did not end up with the best possible system. A high-speed line needs dedicated tracks, which will never be built in this country without the political will.
2005-04-22	Amtrak Offers Package Seeking More Money From States	Amtrak proposed a package of changes on Thursday that would seek additional money from states and from commuter rail lines that operate on its tracks. The proposal raises the possibility of allowing other companies to take over some services or even run trains. In exchange, Amtrak asked Congress for $1.8 billion for the next fiscal year, about 50 percent more than it is receiving.
2005-04-22	What's the Matter With Amtrak?	To the Editor: It should have been clear in the days after 9/11 -- and the subsequent shutdown of the country's air traffic system -- that a good passenger train system was needed. It should be regarded as a matter of national security.
2005-04-22	What's the Matter With Amtrak?	To the Editor: The problem with Acela is that it was a compromise high-speed system. Instead of building from the ground up, including tracks, Amtrak chose to beef up an antiquated technology.
2005-04-22	What's the Matter With Amtrak?	To the Editor: John Tierney suggests that Amtrak will never succeed without competition. History suggests otherwise. The era of competition created a hodgepodge of inept and inefficient railways. It wasn't until Amtrak that there was serious national coverage.
2005-04-21	Acela Trains Will Not Run Until Summer, Amtrak Says	Amtrak said Wednesday that brake problems on its Acela Express trains would keep them out of service until sometime in the summer and that in the meantime, it was bringing back the old Metroliners. They will be used to fill nearly all of the Acelas' departure slots from Washington to New York, and Amtrak is also adding some trains from New York to Boston. Amtrak abruptly took all 20 of its high-speed Acelas out of service last Thursday after cracks were discovered in brake parts.
2005-04-19	The Railroad to Nowhere	Nearly five years ago, as Amtrak officials were hailing their new Acela train as ''a giant step forward'' for America and ''the kind of rail system we've all been dreaming about for decades,'' a former Amtrak official named Joseph Vranich offered another perspective. ''I say without equivocation,'' he told The Hartford Courant, ''that the Acela program is turning into the world's worst high-speed program.''
2005-04-19	Amtrak Says Brake Trouble Will Not Hurt in Long Run	The chairman of Amtrak said yesterday that the brake problem on the Acela Express trains would not seriously hurt the railroad in the long term, but that no one knew when the trains would be back in service because no one was sure what it would take to fix them. David M. Laney, who became the Amtrak chairman last May, said in a telephone interview, ''We don't want to head down a path that requires a significant investment and then a significant reinvestment if you have to replace them again a month later or six months later.'' Apart from repair, the loss of the trains, he said, was costing Amtrak millions of dollars in revenue.
2005-04-18	After Refitting, Amtrak Plans Limited Acela Service	At least one Acela Express train will be ready to run by Monday morning, an Amtrak spokesman said on Sunday, after mechanics took axles with good brakes from 18 Acela trains and were installing them on two other trains. A brake problem has forced Amtrak to halt all its Acela Express trains since Friday morning. The railroad was also planning to use conventional, lower-speed equipment to make some of the trips normally made by Acela Express trains, said the spokesman, Clifford Black. To make that possible, Amtrak has canceled some regular midday trains, called Acela Regionals.
2005-04-17	Amtrak, Lacking Acela, Tries to Make Do With Other Trains	Amtrak predicted on Saturday that it would have more travelers than seats between Washington and Boston for the coming week because its Acela Express trains were sidelined on Friday after cracks were discovered in the brakes. But the railroad was redeploying equipment to try to meet demand, and was also anticipating that customers would plan ahead as they could not on Friday, when they showed up for express trains that they did not know had been canceled, and had to squeeze onto local trains.
2005-04-16	CRACKS IN BRAKES PROMPT AMTRAK TO HALT ACELAS	Amtrak took all its Acela Express trains out of service early Friday morning after a government inspector looking under a train following a speed experiment noticed cracks in the brakes, and a quick check found hundreds of similar flaws on other trains. The discovery of widespread fissures in the brake discs disrupted the travel plans of more than 10,000 people who ride the Acela Express trains every weekday along the Northeast Corridor between Boston, New York and Washington.
2005-04-13	Metro Briefing | New York: U.S. Awards $42.1 Million In Homeland Security Aid	The New York City region will receive $42.1 million to improve security in its subway, commuter rail and bus systems, the Department of Homeland Security announced yesterday. The area is to receive $37.6 million for rail security, to be shared by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, New Jersey Transit and the Connecticut Department of Transportation. About $4.5 million will go for security on Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New Jersey Transit buses. The department provided the region with about a third of the $130.3 million in such funds provided nationwide. The department also said it would give Amtrak $6.4 million to improve security along the Northeast Corridor and at the railroad's Chicago hub and hold a grant competition for $5 million to improve security on ferry systems.

2005-03-25	Amtrak Board Wary of Bush's Overhaul Plan	The chairman of Amtrak, David M. Laney, has signaled for the first time that the independent board that runs the railroad objects to significant parts of President Bush's plans to overhaul the passenger rail system, especially the idea to reorganize the company through bankruptcy. But the board Mr. Laney heads has still not agreed on its own proposal. Mr. Bush has called for the elimination of federal aid in six months, which would kill the railroad unless it is restructured. Under his plan, if Amtrak can be reorganized, most subsidies would be paid by states, an idea that many state officials reject.
2005-03-18	New York Official to Head U.S. Rail Agency	President Bush intends to nominate Joseph H. Boardman, the head of the New York State Department of Transportation, to be the federal railroad administrator, the White House said yesterday. The Federal Railroad Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, is a safety regulator and also a conduit for grant money. Mr. Boardman, transportation commissioner in Albany since 1997, has taken a special interest in rail transportation and is chairman of the rail committee of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
2005-03-17	Tax Cut Plan Withstands A Challenge In the Senate	President Bush's tax cuts survived an important challenge in the Senate on Wednesday, when lawmakers voted by the narrowest of margins to defeat budget language that would have made it more difficult to extend the cuts for another five years. In a 50-50 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected so-called pay-as-you-go rules, which would have required that any tax cuts or new spending programs be offset with savings in other areas. Last year, the Senate approved the rules, prompting a dispute with the House that ultimately prevented Congress from passing a budget.
2005-03-02	Don't Cut Off Money for Amtrak	To the Editor: Re ''Starving Amtrak to Save It,'' by Norman Y. Mineta, the transportation secretary (Op-Ed, Feb. 23):
2005-02-23	Starving Amtrak To Save It	SOMETIMES in government, it takes more than words to bring about change for the better. Case in point: earlier this month President Bush, frustrated that Congress had not moved on his proposed reforms to the passenger rail system, said that subsidies for Amtrak should be eliminated starting Oct. 1. And since then, something interesting has happened: lawmakers, journalists and citizens are starting to talk seriously about the future of passenger trains in America. Many have been critical of the changes the president and I have proposed. That's understandable. For three decades, Amtrak has been synonymous with intercity passenger rail -- because it alone has been the conduit for all federal passenger rail investment. But the 34-year partnership between the government and Amtrak has failed. Far from yielding a vibrant and growing passenger system, it has produced one that limps along on life support from year to year.
2005-02-20	Amtrak's Own Board Sows Alarm About System's Future	As Amtrak's supporters in Congress seek to renew the federal subsidy for the railroad despite President Bush's plan to eliminate federal aid, the railroad faces a new challenge: the ambivalence of its own board of directors. The board, whose four members were appointed by President Bush, missed a Feb. 15 deadline to submit a budget request to Congress. Two days later, the chairman, David M. Laney, sent a letter to Congress saying that the board plans to make a grant request, but that ''the status quo at Amtrak is neither viable nor acceptable.''
2005-02-13	Leasing Locomotives To Assist Commuter Rail	The state has agreed to lease eight Amtrak locomotives that are the missing link in a plan to improve commuter rail service. The locomotives will be used with rail cars purchased last year from Virginia, according to a news release from the governor's office. They will be leased for $20,000 each a month and the state will have an option to buy the locomotives through July 2007, according to the release.
2005-02-10	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Car Falls On Railroad Tracks	A car that careened off an exit ramp on the Henry Hudson Parkway last evening crashed through a fence and landed on two Amtrak tracks, disrupting service between Pennsylvania Station and Albany for two hours, officials said last night. The accident occurred shortly after 7 p.m. when a late-model Dodge heading north left the parkway at 125th Street and sped along the exit ramp, when it crashed through the fence, the police said. The driver, a 20-year-old man, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he was in stable condition last night, the police said. The accident delayed three trains, according to Sarah Swain, an Amtrak spokeswoman. Service was restored when one track reopened at 9:07 p.m., Ms. Swain said. Michelle O'Donnell (NYT)
2005-02-08	Subject to Bush's Knife: Aid for Food and Heating	Under President Bush's budget, many food stamp recipients, farmers, veterans, small-business owners, nursing students, air travelers and Amtrak passengers would have to pay more or would receive less from the government. Spending for domestic programs, aside from security and entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, would decline slightly in 2006, to $389 billion, and would remain flat for the next four years -- a freeze with no obvious precedent in the last two decades. The budget promises to reduce the deficit to $207 billion in 2010, from a record $412 billion last year. Mr. Bush proposes stricter eligibility rules for food stamps, expected to save $57 million in 2006 and $1.1 billion over 10 years. Under the proposal, welfare recipients who receive only child care, education, training and other services would no longer be automatically eligible for food stamps. Poor people receiving cash assistance would remain automatically eligible.
2005-02-08	Amtrak Financing Nearly Eliminated	Highway financing would rise slightly while almost all spending for Amtrak would be eliminated under the Transportation Department budget. The plan would also give the Federal Aviation Administration more money to hire air traffic controllers but cut spending for airport improvements. The budget provides no money for Amtrak itself, but it does include $360 million to maintain commuter service that uses Amtrak tracks in the Northeast corridor if the railroad goes bankrupt.
2005-02-02	Bush to Propose Elimination Of Federal Subsidy for Amtrak	The president's budget for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1 will propose eliminating operating subsidies for Amtrak, administration officials said on Tuesday evening. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because, they said, they were not supposed to give out details of the budget before it was presented on Monday. The decision regarding Amtrak was first reported by the Reuters news agency.
2005-01-15	Amtrak and New Jersey Transit Delayed by Two Rail Mishaps	A downed electrical wire and a broken track switch caused delays yesterday for thousands of New Jersey Transit and Amtrak passengers trying to get to or leave from Pennsylvania Station, officials said. The mishaps were repaired before the start of the evening commuter rush. At 10:06 a.m., a New Jersey Transit train's pantograph -- the extensible arm that draws electricity into the locomotive -- became tangled in a set of overhead wires as the train moved through a tunnel, according to a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, Dan Stessel.
2005-01-06	Leaving on That Morning Train to Albany, With Hopes for an On-Time Performance	The New York politicos were still an hour south of Albany on Wednesday morning, yet the realities of the 2005 political season in the capital had already set in. As the cellphone service grew spottier and a wet snow spit down, the outlook for state government reforms struck some as equally grim. The mood for the trip, to Gov. George E. Pataki's annual address to the Legislature, was set early. Droopy-eyed Albany-bound passengers were squeezed into the first car of the 7:15 a.m. train, where they jockeyed for Hudson-view seats on the left side -- only to discover, to their consternation, that other train cars were mostly empty. Riders mused about a shadowy conspiracy to make government types squeeze into seats uncomfortably.
2004-12-30	DEATH ON THE TRACKS: When Signals Fail; Questions Raised on Warnings at Rail Crossings	It was late afternoon on July 14, 2002, when Amtrak train No.391 pulled out of Union Station in Chicago, bound for Southern Illinois. Several hours later, the train began to run a gantlet of hazardous highway crossings where gates and warning lights malfunctioned, endangering both passengers and motorists. The first problem arose at a crossing in Cumberland County. Eight miles down the track, it happened at another crossing. Then another. And another. By the time Amtrak 391 reached the small town of Odin, signals at seven crossings had failed to give drivers proper warning of at least 20 seconds, according to federal records.
2004-12-26	Rail Car Promise Is Still a Promise	ONE of the final pieces of good news delivered by former Gov. John G. Rowland before he left the Capitol amid an impeachment investigation appears to have been overly optimistic. Mr. Rowland announced in June that the state was purchasing 38 used train cars from Virginia, which ''will quickly add approximately 4,000 seats to Connecticut's commuter rail service prior to the start of the fall commuting season.''

2004-11-29	Julie, the 21st-Century Voice of Amtrak	To the Editor: With all the news in the paper about violence, war and corporate malfeasance, it was such a treat to read your article about the Amtrak phone system, Julie. As a frequent user of the system, I have been curious about the voice, as it sounds computer-generated -- and absolutely is one of the most friendly systems I have come across. Michael Gormley New York, Nov. 24, 2004

2004-11-24	Your Train Will Be Late, She Says Cheerily; Voice of Amtrak Computer Works on Frayed Nerves	Amid long lines and frayed nerves typical during the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend, roughly 600,000 rail travelers nationwide will squeeze on and off trains, with one-third passing through Pennsylvania Station. Through it all Julie will remain unshakably courteous and tirelessly chipper.

2004-11-22	Official Says Deferral Strategy Fails Amtrak	Amtrak's strategy of scraping by on limited budgets by deferring crucial capital investments ''is no longer workable,'' according to the inspector general of the Transportation Department, who said in a new report that Congress should either give the railroad more money or tell it to cut back operations. In the report, the inspector general, Kenneth M. Mead, said that the railroad was struggling with unsustainable operating losses, declining on-time performance and the possibility of a major failure of aging equipment that would interrupt operations, although ''no one knows where or when such a failure may occur.''
2004-11-07	Caution on Water	To the Editor: Susan Stellin's article about water quality on airlines reminded me of an issue that has bothered me for some time. The Amtrak trains that run between Washington and Boston have water taps in the toilets of a type that I have never seen elsewhere. They do not have handles, nor are they operated by a sensor. Instead, a small rod with a knob on the end extends from within the waterspout.
2004-10-31	Amtrak Will Enforce Limits on Luggage	Starting Nov. 1, Amtrak will begin strictly enforcing baggage guidelines that limit passengers to two carry-ons and three pieces of checked luggage. Amtrak officials say their decision to crack down on excessive luggage is intended to provide safer, more comfortable travel, prevent overcrowding of the baggage areas and reduce injuries. ''The amount of baggage people take with them, especially the huge, wheeled bags, is mind-blowing,'' said Marc Magliari, a spokesman for Amtrak.
2004-10-28	State's Project for a Grand New Penn Station Is Moving Again	The $910 million plan to transform the city's former central post office building into a grand new Pennsylvania Station is once again lurching forward. State officials said yesterday that they had lined up two anchor tenants and most of the financing and were close to picking a developer. The state has narrowed the list of potential developers to four from six and is now asking for specific proposals for converting the blocklong James A. Farley Building on Eighth Avenue into a gleaming Moynihan Station, named after the senator who was its champion. The state expects to choose a developer in March and to start construction next summer.
2004-10-15	Amtrak Pays Millions for Others' Fatal Errors	It is no mystery why, one spring day two years ago, an Amtrak passenger train jumped the tracks near Crescent City, Fla., and skidded to a stop on its side, killing 4 people and injuring 142. Investigators concluded that the track, owned by the big freight railroad CSX, had not been properly stabilized and that management's oversight of maintenance had been lax. But when millions of dollars in damage claims arose from the crash, it was not CSX, a multibillion-dollar corporation, that paid them. It was Amtrak, the perennial money loser that survives only with regular infusions of cash from American taxpayers.
2004-10-10	A Fast Train, Running Late; Costs and Feuds Stall A High-Speed Corridor	It began six years ago as a grand plan to make New York a national leader in high-speed rail service. At the time, the details sounded simple enough: recondition a group of old trains with high-powered turbine engines, make some adjustments on railroad tracks to create more straight-aways and allow the trains to pick up speed, and, just like that, a fast, convenient way to travel between Albany and New York City in just two hours would be set to roll.

2004-09-29	Bridges on Their Last Legs Pose Problems for Trains	Passengers riding the rails in the Northeast hardly notice the three busy drawbridges they cross in southeastern Connecticut. But Amtrak engineers say the bridges are in such dire condition that they threaten to sever service between New York and Boston and curtail access to three rivers. The tiny 291-foot drawbridge that has operated over the Niantic River here for 97 years is the busiest of the three. Its steel supports have holes so large, a person can stick a finger in them. To the east, bolts supporting a four-million-pound counterweight keep failing on the 85-year-old bridge that runs over the Thames River. To the west, structural support pins are wearing out on the bridge that ferries trains over the Connecticut River, much as it has for 97 years.
2004-09-29	Fire in Commuter Train Tunnel Is Traced to a Wire in Queens	It started with a single power line that somehow fell down. The line, one of a series of electrical wires that power trains and equipment, fell on another overhead wire along the railroad tracks that run from Queens into Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That mishap on Monday afternoon, railroad officials said, set in motion the chain of events that brought the station to a standstill and disrupted the trip home for more than 100,000 commuters.
2004-09-28	Tunnel Fire Snarls Evening Rush at Penn Station	A fire deep underground in one of the tunnels that feed into Pennsylvania Station halted train traffic for hours yesterday and briefly shut down the terminal, causing confusion and long delays for more than 100,000 riders trying to get home for the evening. The Long Island Rail Road, the biggest user of Penn Station, was unable to operate any trains into or out of the terminal throughout the afternoon into the evening rush. New Jersey Transit and Amtrak riders were stymied as well until limited service was restored about 4 p.m.
2004-09-28	A Crammed and Confused Evening Rush	At 2 p.m., they were curious. At 4 p.m., they were confused. By 6 p.m., they were angry. As an underground fire brought Pennsylvania Station to a standstill yesterday, the afternoon wore on in a sort of organized chaos. Passengers had few clues about what was causing the delay, and nobody could offer any guesses about when service would resume.
2004-09-12	A Republican on Ice In a Land of Democrats	IT is the political season in Montclair. The cocktail-party canapes are seductively fresh and the town's drawing-room talk is Democratic, often veering sharply to the left. But Floyd Hall, an unabashed Republican, does not seem to mind. In fact, Mr. Hall, a 66-year-old businessman who lives in the decidedly liberal suburb, has openly declared his presence here. On this day, he is behind his desk at the Floyd Hall Ice Arena at Montclair State University in nearby Little Falls. Mr. Hall, a former chief executive of K-Mart, Target stores, Grand Union supermarkets and B. Dalton Booksellers, owns businesses and operates the arena through his company: the consistently named Floyd Hall Enterprises. Speaking of his politics, Mr. Hall laughed and said, ''It makes for some pretty stiff dinner conversations, yes. I guess I'm sort of on the wrong side for Jersey politics.'' Then his tone became more earnest. ''You've got to have your beliefs,'' he said. ''My belief is that we need less big government and we need more money in the hands of individuals. The government's job is to build infrastructures for us and provide for safety of our people.'' He concluded, ''Bush has done a wonderful job of that and getting it organized, although I'm more of a moderate -- certainly not a conservative.'' Mr. Hall also considers himself to be retired, but in a working retirement with a new venture into public service. In July, the United States Senate confirmed his appointment to the Amtrak Reform Board, a creation of the Bush administration and an attempt to control the public railroad's juggernaut of a proposed $1.8 billion budget. Perhaps because of his reputation as a ''turnaround'' retailer, Mr. Hall accepted the challenge, in hopes of untangling a situation he said appears similar to corporate issues. ''I must have irritated somebody in the administration,'' he said, before firing off a series of questions. In this working retirement, Mr. Hall's dress tends to reflect his mood. He rarely wears a tie, even though his shirts are fully starched. His feet, sheathed in polished black loafers, are without socks. ''Does Amtrak have a strategic plan?'' he began. ''Do they really know what they want to be? And are they making progress toward it? Is the plan practical and can it be implemented? Is there sufficient capital and is it being spent in the right places -- cautiously, so it's not being wasted?'' Mr. Hall paused for a drink of water before launching his final round. ''Does Amtrak have the discipline it needs to stay the course?'' he asked. For all of the rapid-fire questioning, he is guardedly optimistic, and said that his initial impression of Amtrak's management has been ''very, very favorable,'' even as he estimates the railroad's budget proposal could be cut drastically. ''No passenger railroad in the world makes money, that I'm aware of,'' he said. ''Certainly, none of them have the challenges that we have here, with the size of this country. I believe that a national passenger railroad system makes sense -- and there are better answers available than we have currently.'' And yet Mr. Hall -- a teenage runaway who grew to become a champion salesman of household appliances -- has also traveled a lengthy road to reach corporate boardrooms and his Montclair address, which he shares with his wife of 47 years, Jan, whom he met in high school. In addition to their son, Larry, the couple has a daughter, Karen Visceglia, both of Verona, as well as two granddaughters. By his own account, he grew up in a working-class family in Bakersfield, Calif., one of seven children, including a twin brother. Mr. Hall, whose parents were divorced, left school at 15 to enlist in the Army, pursuing the underage ruse for six months, until a former neighbor recognized him in uniform. He then worked as a laborer in Bakersfield's oil industry and with a land surveying team before discovering his true calling: persuasion, in sales of electronics and appliances for Montgomery Ward. ''I was very ambitious, always,'' he said. ''I always wanted to do a little bit better than anybody else. As a result of that, people gave me responsibilities in a lot of organizations. I delivered what was expected of me and then some.'' He advanced in sales positions before jumping to the Singer Company, where he made the transition into corporate management. Subsequently, Mr. Hall became chief executive of B. Dalton, before holding the same position at Target. Next, while serving as chief executive of Grand Union, he assembled a group of investors to buy the company, which he ultimately sold in 1988 and retired at the age of 50. ''I went home and got my golf clubs out and said: 'This is it. I'm going to join the poker game at the club on Wednesday night,''' said Mr. Hall, raising his eyebrows, hinting at his own disbelief. ''That lasted about 120 days. I was bored to tears.'' Soon after, Mr. Hall joined his son, Larry, in founding The Museum Company, a chain of retail stores that sells copies of art objects. ''Basically, I've always thought of myself as an entrepreneur,'' he said. ''I was in the corporate world, but I still felt, deep down, that I wanted to own my own businesses and be my own boss.'' Regardless, Mr. Hall again heeded the corporate call in 1995, to become chief executive of K-Mart. Then in 1999, he received a compensation package from the retailing giant reported at $3.6 million, although he declined to disclose his net worth. He retired -- one more time -- a year later, to oversee his own interests at Floyd Hall Enterprises, among them a stable of thoroughbred horses in the Meadowlands, the ice arena and an entirely new hobby, ownership of the New Jersey Jackals, a minor-league baseball team. If the years have been good to Mr. Hall, in terms of material bounty, he said his deeper interests happen to be rooted in children and family. He paused, before saying: ''I really believe that most of our problems stem back to having to live without the things that everybody in America is entitled to. We should have plenty to eat -- that shouldn't be an issue. We should be able to have decent clothes and accommodations for our people.'' Then he added, ''I just think that there are ages where you can get children on the right course and build values in them, so they're going to grow up good citizens, happy and satisfied.'' In 1997, Mr. Hall established an unusual partnership with Montclair State. At a cost of $22 million, he built the ice arena and the 4,000-seat Yogi Berra stadium, where the Jackals began playing the following year. He donated the facilities to the university in return for a 40-year lease to use them. So far, he said, profits from the ice arena have offset losses from the baseball stadium. ''I'm not really sure why in New Jersey there's not much support,'' he said. ''We keep trying. After seven years, we haven't given up on filling the seats. It would be better if our ballplayers played in front of a full house.'' Mr. Hall retains an office at the ice arena, where he can observe the hockey teams and figure skaters practicing below. Floyd Hall Enterprises, which includes his son, also owns the Essex Equestrian Center in West Orange and the Danbury Ice Arena in Connecticut. Although he has been known to work every day, he maintains a vacation house in Ocean Reef, Fla., south of Miami, where he golfs and fishes. He eschews state politics, but is active on the Republican National Committee and said he anticipates a steady pull on his time in coming months from the Amtrak board. ''Management,'' said Mr. Hall, rising from a conference table, ''is the art of getting things done through people.'' And then he added: ''Leadership is the art of making them want to do it. If you can get people to do their jobs, your job just got enormously easier.''
2004-09-07	A New Penn Station	To the Editor: Re ''At Penn Station, a Stalled Revival'' (Critic's Notebook, Sept. 2): To build a new, cosmetically superior Penn Station at a cost of $800 million -- which will bring no improvement in travel options or convenience for rail passengers -- looks like a big waste of money.
2004-08-15	No-Rush California	Two years ago, after I described a rail journey across the Southwest in an article headlined ''Amtrak Must Die,'' I was deluged with letters from rail buffs complaining that I'd taken the wrong train. Yes, they acknowledged, Amtrak had lousy service on many routes, but there was hope on at least one stretch of tracks. Try the Coast Starlight, they said. This daily train follows a route down the West Coast that induces fits of ecstatic nostalgia among the community of rail buffs who call themselves ''foamers,'' as in foaming at the mouth. It is described as ''the most spectacular seashore route in the world'' in the foamers' bible, ''The Trains We Rode,'' a 1965 paean to the golden age of rail by Lucius Beebe and Charles Clegg. The book lovingly chronicles the views and the elegant accommodations on some of the route's old trains, like the Starlight and the deluxe Coast Daylight, which was advertised by Southern Pacific as ''the most beautiful train in the world.''
2004-08-01	Amtrak Adds Security For G.O.P. Convention	Amtrak has announced that from Aug. 28 to Sept. 2, it will require passengers to make reservations on nearly all its trains that serve New York. The change is part of security precautions for the Republican National Convention, which will take place Aug. 30 to Sept. 2 in Madison Square Garden, one of the buildings above Penn Station. The railroad will not change its schedule during this time, it said, but most of the unreserved Amtrak trains serving New York will require reservations for all route segments in the Washington-to-Boston Northeast Corridor, including the New York Empire Service, to Albany and Buffalo.
2004-07-23	Religious Note in Bathroom Halts Train for 90 Minutes	For 90 minutes on Thursday morning, passengers aboard an Amtrak train headed to New York and Boston were questioned and videotaped as the train's seven cars were searched after a note containing Muslim and anti-Semitic phrases was found in a cafe car bathroom. No arrests were made at Pennsylvania Station in Newark, where the train was stopped just before 8 a.m., but all 450 passengers were asked to give their names, addresses, Social Security numbers and other information. They were videotaped before being allowed to get off or continue their trips. The train, Amtrak Train 170, left 30th Street Station in Philadelphia at 6:55 a.m., on time and without incident, according to passengers who were on board. But around 7:45, minutes before pulling into Newark, an Amtrak employee speaking on the public address system asked passengers planning to get off to remain seated, said Al Leckerman, a passenger who was traveling to New York.
2004-07-21	Power Failures in New Jersey Snarl the Homebound Rush	An on-again, off-again power failure on a stretch of railroad tracks in northern New Jersey played havoc with train service to and from Manhattan yesterday evening, stranding some commuters in sunbaked trains and sweaty stations and delaying hundreds of others. Amtrak and New Jersey Transit said that trains from Manhattan were delayed at least 40 minutes and that no trains entered Manhattan between 4:30 and 7 p.m.
2004-07-18	Anyone for 'Flight of the Bumblebee'?	NOW this is class. None of that twaddling flute and tinkling piano banality, Muzak-style, that you hear at the Long Island Rail Road waiting area. In this fetid corner of the Amtrak/New Jersey Transit part of Penn Station, near the baggage check-in counter, an overhead speaker squeezes out the sounds of plangent Renaissance strings, an 18th-century guitar and a harpsichord. Could that be a Bach flute sonata?
2004-07-18	Amtrak Grapples With Aging Equipment	AMTRAK is still struggling to find the money for the capital improvements it says it needs to return to a state of good repair, but the railroad says it is making progress, and is putting more coaches and locomotives on the rails, buying new car carriers for the Auto Train, and working with states for expansion of rail service on corridors of less than 500 miles. On any given day, fewer than 80 percent of Amtrak's cars are in service. ''There are days in the Northeast Corridor when we could fill every seat we could put out there, '' said David Gunn, Amtrak's president, at a briefing in June where he explained the railroad's five-year plan. The lack of cars is ''costing us money,'' he said.
2004-07-13	World-Class Trains? Not Even Close	All over Europe, in Japan, and elsewhere, business travelers have the option of avoiding planes and taking sleek high-speed trains that link urban centers. In France, average train speeds on some corridors exceed 180 miles an hour. With direct links to airports for those continuing on for greater distances or flying overseas, these high-speed trains are vital components of an intelligent transportation system. The United States managed to put the first man on the moon over a third of a century ago, but this country doesn't come anywhere close to having a world-class rail-transportation system. Oh, we have some great trains, including a few long-haul Amtrak ones that have been called cruise ships on tracks.
2004-07-03	National Briefing | Washington: Amtrak Employees Lose On Halting Work	A federal appeals panel said Amtrak employees could not legally halt work to protest a lack of subsidies for the agency. ''Call it a political protest rather than a strike,'' the court said. ''No matter.'' John Files(NYT)
2004-07-01	Penn Station Exit Closings Expected to Cause Crowding	A study conducted by railroad officials on the flow of people in and out of Pennsylvania Station shows that New York City's plans to close six of the terminal's eight exits during the Republican National Convention could cause serious inconvenience for the more than 600,000 people who use the station every day. For security reasons, the city plans to close both exits on the Amtrak level of the Eighth Avenue side of the station, and the two in the middle of the terminal that lead to the old taxiway between 31st and 33rd Streets. The two exits on 33rd Street and 8th Avenue for the A, C and E subway trains will be closed as well.
2004-06-30	Amtrak Chief Says Finances Are Better, Delays Worse	Amtrak's revenues have been stronger than expected in the last few months, and operating expenses have been lower, so the railroad's financial stability has improved, the president, David Gunn, said Tuesday. But rebuilding efforts on track that the railroad owns have increased delays, as have equipment failures and congestion on freight railroads. Mr. Gunn also said the system runs the risk of ''major asset failure'' that would be extremely disruptive to service, because it relies on very old bridges and electrical systems, he said.
2004-06-29	Want to Be Unpopular? Start With a Cellphone	Last week, in a column about the proliferation of cellphone louts on Amtrak trains, including on the single, ostensibly cellphone-free Quiet Cars that Amtrak operates, I asked for reader responses. An avalanche of e-mail messages arrived. I have been traveling out of the country and have been unable to respond yet to most of the mail, though I have read it all avidly. Unfortunately, I can share only a few excerpts here. Let us just say that a powerful backlash has formed against the cellphone blabbing that reverberates through trains, planes, buses and in other public spaces.
2004-06-22	Can You Hear Me Now? All Too Clearly, I'm Afraid	''SHE'S sort of a mousy housewife who doesn't want to fight,'' the lawyer said loudly into his cellphone. He was talking to a colleague about a client he was representing in a divorce. I was involuntarily listening to this while sitting across the aisle from the lawyer in a business-class car of a southbound Acela Express train. For about 10 minutes, this cell-yeller persisted in broadcasting intimate details about the woman and her cad of a husband who, as those of us sitting nearby learned, was keeping a girlfriend at an apartment that he paid for. Before this performance was finished, a businesswoman in the seat in front of me whipped out her cellphone and loudly announced that a colleague named George was in big trouble and didn't know it. ''George is being cut out,'' she said. ''It's going to get ugly.''
2004-06-02	Fixing Up the Tunnels While the Trains Run	The tunnels that feed into Pennsylvania Station have long troubled those who have seen them. A serious train accident under the East or Hudson Rivers could send panicked passengers stampeding up the spiral staircases that rise 10 stories to the surface but are so narrow that rescue workers would not be able to descend at the same time. Passengers trying to walk out might have to edge along narrow, crumbling ledges along the walls. And firefighters rushing to help would be hampered by the absence of a water supply that runs the length of the tunnels.
2004-05-28	Amtrak's New Station in Doubt Over Rent Issue	After years of delays, plans for a grand, new Pennsylvania Station built within the city's main post office building are being muddied by demands from Amtrak, the intended tenant, that it be allowed to use the space without paying any rent. Amtrak was supposed to anchor the soaring, glass-enclosed complex in the landmark James A. Farley post office building between Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 31st and 33rd Streets in Manhattan. But over the last few months, Amtrak has been weighing whether it should even continue to take part in the project, given its financial problems, said Clifford Black, a spokesman for the railroad. The railroad had said previously that it would not pay anything for the renovation of the station. And now Amtrak notes that it already has a sweet rent deal.
2004-05-05	Screening Begins at Maryland Train Station	It was not quite the full airport treatment, but on Tuesday passengers boarding Amtrak and commuter trains here just outside Washington began walking through a machine that sniffs for explosives, and putting their bags through an X-ray unit that looks for bombs. The inspections will continue for 30 days, to be followed by a test of the ability to screen bags checked at Union Station in Washington, and screening on the trains themselves.
2004-04-21	Railroad Officials Blame Human Error in Crash of 2 Trains at Pennsylvania Station	The arithmetic underlying Pennsylvania Station is mind-bending: 1,005 trains a day, from three different railroads, barreling through seven tunnels, converging on just 21 tracks in one aging station, bursting at the seams. That is the daily challenge that is the nation's busiest railroad station. There are days when things run smoothly, with dispatchers able to route trains according to a planned checklist or sail through alternatives without any delays for harried passengers. Then there are days like Monday, when a simple mistake by a careless train operator can throw an entire system, choreographed down to the second, askew.
2004-04-20	127 Hurt as Train Hits Another Near Penn Station	An empty Amtrak train crashed into the back of a Long Island Rail Road train full of commuters about a half-mile short of Pennsylvania Station yesterday morning, hurling passengers down aisles or into the seats in front of them and injuring 127, the authorities said. The forceful crash was little more than a fender-bender in terms of train accidents, and none of the injuries were considered life-threatening, but it created a jarring tableau in the bustling Midtown station: hundreds of dazed commuters, some bloodied or in neck braces, lying on stretchers or standing unsteadily in line awaiting evaluation. In a scene just as alarming aboveground, dozens of emergency vehicles swarmed Penn Station.
2004-04-16	Train Station Set as Test Site For Screening Of Passengers	The Bush administration plans to begin testing techniques next month for improving passenger rail security at a station in suburban Maryland that is served by Amtrak and commuter trains running between Washington and Baltimore, government officials said. Passenger screening at the New Carrollton, Md., station will be conducted by the Transportation Security Administration, but will not be as invasive as airport searches.
2004-04-07	Passenger Dies As Train Derails In Mississippi	An Amtrak train derailed and crashed on its side last night in rural Mississippi, killing at least one person, critically injuring two more and leaving scores of people injured, the authorities said. The Chicago-bound train, the City of New Orleans, went off the rails about 6:30 p.m. about 30 miles north of Jackson in Yazoo County, Lea Stokes, a spokeswoman for Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said. It had come from New Orleans and was carrying 68 passengers and 12 crewmembers.
2004-03-18	2 Equipment Makers Settle Dispute With Amtrak	Bombardier of Montreal and Alstom of Paris agreed yesterday to settle a legal dispute with Amtrak in which the sides had blamed each other for a largely failed attempt to apply European high-speed train technology to the United States rail system. The agreement, which came as Bombardier announced plans to eliminate 6,600 jobs worldwide in a huge realignment of its troubled rail division in Europe, will enable the manufacturers to concentrate on a return to financial health. It will also allow Amtrak to eliminate a distraction just as its president, David L. Gunn, appears to be making progress in improving Amtrak's deteriorated infrastructure, including tracks between Washington and Boston, and locomotives.
2004-03-16	MEMO PAD	Amtrak Responds To Terror Attacks Amtrak is responding to the terrorist attacks on trains in Madrid last week by stepping up police patrols and ''conducting random baggage screening'' at major stations, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for the railroad. The attacks in Spain came as Amtrak is struggling with its budget to keep pace with a steady growth in demand in the United States, as indicated by a 2.7 percent increase in ridership to a record 24,028,119 passengers in fiscal 2003, which ended Sept. 30. The Pacific Surfliner trains on the coast of Southern California roughly between San Diego and Los Angeles had 26.3 percent more riders in fiscal 2003 than the year before. Ridership on Acela-Metroliner trains in the Northeast corridor dropped 8.6 percent for the year because of equipment problems that forced a cutback in frequency, Mr. Stessel said. Frequency on those routes is nearly back to normal, he added.
2004-02-01	Amtrak's Wariness Imperils Grand Central-L.I.R.R. Link	The East Side access project, a plan to bring Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal that has moved in fits and starts for 40 years, has hit a snag: Amtrak's financial straits. Since the 1960's, the plan has been to run Long Island Rail Road trains from an existing complex of switches in Queens, shared with Amtrak, over about a mile of new track to an underused tunnel beneath the East River. That tunnel emerges in Manhattan at East 63rd Street, and from there, the trains would go through a new tunnel and join the tracks under Park Avenue that carry Metro-North trains to Grand Central. The new link would move perhaps 90,000 passengers a day on about 150 trains. It would relieve crowding at Pennsylvania Station and lure to the rails Long Island residents who work in east Midtown.
2004-01-20	Boston to New York: Four Ways to Make the Trip	The 200-mile distance between Boston and New York is one of the busiest corporate travel stretches in the United States. According to NYC & Company, a tourism marketing organization, 316,000 Bostonians travel to New York for business each year. The Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates that almost a million New Yorkers return the favor. Now, there is a new way to connect the cities. On Oct. 1, the LimoLiner, a luxury bus service that runs between the Back Bay and Midtown Manhattan three times each weekday and once on Sundays for $69 each way, opened for business. The trip usually takes about four hours.
2004-01-15	On the Rails: Rolling Without Roaming	IF not for the lack of privacy, Superman would love a telephone booth like this: nice comfy chairs, a snack bar and plenty of scenery rolling by. Amtrak trains -- particularly the Acela Express between Boston and Washington -- have become a rolling office for many, from college students to salesmen making deals up and down the rails. Even though it generally takes longer than flying, train travel is preferred by some because cellphones are allowed, not to mention the other amenities, like conference tables, wide seats, electrical outlets and a well-stocked cafe car.

2003-11-16	Repairing Amtrak	To the Editor: Re ''Amtrak's Budgetary Crapshoot'' (editorial, Nov. 3): No amount of money can solve what ails Amtrak. The issue before Congress is a matter of profound choice, between embracing the status quo of a failed business model and undertaking critical institutional reforms. Our proposal, the Passenger Rail Investment Reform Act, is the first honest effort in a generation to improve passenger rail transportation in America.
2003-11-09	Amtrak Publishes Nationwide Schedule	For the first time since 1992, Amtrak has published a schedule for the entire railroad, from the Downeaster, which runs between Boston and Portland, Me., to the Pacific Surfliner, linking Paso Robles, Calif., and San Diego. The schedule, which takes the form of a 128-page, magazine-format book, seems designed for people who have never ridden a train. It includes descriptions of each kind of car that Amtrak operates and for the first time in 20 years, fares for many routes. It also describes various discount cards and passes, including the Student Advantage Card, the National Association of Railroad Passengers card, the California Rail Pass and the Florida Rail Pass. The schedule includes connections for the VIA Rail Canada system, and numerous bus connections.
2003-11-07	Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Rahway: Amtrak Reports On Derailment	The derailment of a New Jersey Transit train last week that disrupted travel for thousands of passengers on the line was caused by a defect in track-switching equipment, Amtrak announced yesterday. A 10-car commuter train tried to transfer from one track to another near the Rahway station on Friday and passed over a track switch, which moved. An Amtrak spokesman, Dan Stessel, said that investigators had ruled out vandalism and were trying to determine why the switch moved. The device, now out of service, was installed in April 2001 and passed a monthly test two days before the mishap, he said. No injuries were reported among the 700 passengers. Robert Hanley (NYT)
2003-11-03	Amtrak's Budgetary Crapshoot	Washington lawmakers are haggling over next year's budget for passenger rail. They could force Amtrak to shut down, allow it to limp on while deferring important maintenance, or cover its needs. The right choice -- covering its needs -- is clear. But Amtrak is vulnerable because unlike all other intercity transportation, rail does not have a trust fund with a steady stream of public funds. This is more than a little shortsighted. The development of high-speed trains along a few heavily traveled corridors is crucial in the long term to alleviating highway and airport congestion. But neither the Bush administration nor Congress has a realistic vision for pursuing this goal.
2003-11-01	Train Derails In Rahway On Its Way To Manhattan	A commuter train bound for Manhattan derailed Friday morning, disrupting travel for thousands of passengers on 24 New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains on the Northeast Corridor line, officials said. It was the third derailment since mid-July of a commuter train headed to New York City from New Jersey. None of the 700 passengers were hurt in the derailment, which occurred when the four front wheels on the lead car of a 10-car New Jersey Transit train left the tracks about three-quarters of a mile south of the station here. The train, the 6:30 a.m. from Trenton, was switching from one track to another at low speed about 7:15 a.m. as it approached the station, said Dan Stessel, an Amtrak spokesman. All of the cars remained upright, and the passengers were transferred to other trains to complete their trips.
2003-10-27	Senate Passes Amtrak Subsidy, but a More Frugal House Awaits	The Senate has approved a $1.34 billion subsidy for Amtrak for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, setting up a conflict with the House, which approved a $900 million bill and has been eager for structural changes at the railroad. Amtrak had been seeking $1.8 billion, which it said it needed to return to a state of good repair. The railroad president, David L. Gunn, said in a letter to senators on Wednesday that the $1.34 billion ''leaves us at great risk in terms of reliability'' but that Amtrak could continue operating with an appropriation of that size ''and hopefully not worsen the amount of deferred maintenance.''
2003-10-12	In a Move for Speed, Amtrak to Eliminate Stops in New Haven	Amtrak is trying to make its much-heralded high-speed Acela service faster, and New Haven riders will be affected. The railroad announced that beginning Oct. 27, it will cut four New Haven stops from its 11 daily roundtrips between New York and Boston in an attempt to push the on-time rate from 70 percent to more than 90 percent.
2003-09-17	Amtrak Workers Plan Strike To Protest Lack of Financing	Six Amtrak unions are to announce on Wednesday that they will stop work on Oct. 3, shutting the railroad for the day, to protest Congress's failure to pass a $1.8 billion appropriation for the railroad for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. If carried out, it would be the first time Amtrak workers have walked off the job to protest Congressional policy. In the past, workers have struck over wages or other workplace issues.
2003-08-15	Thousands Stranded on Foot by Crippled Trains, Crawling Buses and Traffic Gridlock	Except for ferries and feet, nearly all other forms of transportation around the metropolitan region failed miserably yesterday. Traffic jams grew to dozens of miles long, stranding buses and even emergency vehicles, as police officers and platoons of well-meaning citizens tried to control the streets with hand-lettered stop-and-go signs. Hundreds of subway and commuter trains were paralyzed, some in tunnels, including a Long Island Rail Road train that was trapped beneath the East River with no air-conditioning for almost two hours.
2003-08-04	Metro Briefing | Connecticut: Milford: Trains Delayed For Hours	Torn electrical wiring over the train tracks just east of Milford caused lengthy delays for passengers on Amtrak and Metro-North trains yesterday, according to officials of both railroads. Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North, said the problems began about 2 p.m. when the wiring was torn down, apparently by a passing train, over one of three tracks. The damaged wires fell across those over another track, putting it out of service, and the third track was already closed for construction, he said. Mr. Brucker said Metro-North put diesel engines and buses into service. But he said 18 Metro North trains between New Haven and Manhattan were delayed, some for just over an hour. Amtrak trains, which run on the same tracks, were delayed by up to five hours, Dan Stessel, an Amtrak spokesman, said. Thomas J. Lueck (NYT)
2003-08-03	AMTRAK OFFERS REFUNDS	Amtrak joined New Jersey Transit last week in promising cash refunds to passengers who endured significant delays in July. Downed power lines disrupted and delayed service for up to six hours on Tuesday on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line. On Wednesday, a letter signed by David L. Gunn, the president of Amtrak, and posted aboard trains said passengers could send in their tickets for a refund of expenses for travel affected by the delay. Earlier in the month, New Jersey Transit officials offered commuters a refund of 15 percent of the cost of the July pass to make up for several delays. Maria Newman
2003-07-31	Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Amtrak To Make Partial Refunds	Amtrak joined New Jersey Transit yesterday in issuing an apology and promising cash refunds to passengers who have endured significant delays this month. Downed power lines caused service disruptions and delays of up to six hours on Tuesday for riders on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line. Yesterday, a letter signed by David L. Gunn, the president of Amtrak, and posted aboard all trains operating between Boston and Washington said passengers could send in their tickets for a refund of their expenses for travel affected by the delay. Last week, New Jersey Transit officials offered to refund 15 percent of the cost of the July monthly pass to commuters, to make up for several delays on its system. Maria Newman (NYT)
2003-07-30	Train Knocks Down Power Lines And Snarls Evening Rail Service	Thousands of rail passengers were delayed yesterday for 90 minutes or more, or forced to find other forms of transportation, after an Amtrak train knocked down overhead power lines on the Northeast Corridor line in New Jersey about 6:30 p.m., the authorities said. The mishap, at the height of the evening rush for Manhattan commuters, resulted in delays for more than 70 New Jersey Transit trains by late last night, said Penny Bassett Hackett, a spokeswoman for the railroad.
2003-07-29	Washington Urges Giving States Power Over Amtrak	The Bush administration proposed today to pay for intercity passenger rail service on the same basis that it pays for mass transit, with Washington paying part of the capital cost, but making the states pick up the rest, along with the operating deficits. Under the plan, the states would decide what service would be offered.
2003-07-22	Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Amtrak Power Shortage Delays Thousands	Most train service from New York City to New Jersey stopped last night for 40 minutes because of insufficient power along the Amtrak line, delaying thousands of people, the authorities said. The rail system through New Jersey to the Philadelphia area needs 15,000 to 25,000 volts to run, but had only 9,000 volts at about 6:03 p.m., said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for Amtrak in Washington. Ten New Jersey Transit trains were on the tracks at the time, and 15 were held in New York, a New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said. No passenger trains ran between New York City and New Jersey, except for those on the PATH line, until full power resumed at 6:42 p.m. Tina Kelley (NYT)
2003-07-15	Sound, Fury and Cellphone Users and Abusers	A woman sought out Amtrak conductor Walter Garrett recently on the Metroliner's Washington-New York run to complain that a fellow commuter had grabbed her cellphone and thrown it against the wall, smashing it into pieces. The incident took place in one of the ''quiet cars'' that Amtrak has designated on certain trains as cellphone-free for riders who treasure tranquillity. The company started the experiment in January 2001 and says it has been a great success. ''Passengers who choose to sit in the quiet car tell other passengers that it's the quiet car,'' an Amtrak spokesman, Dan Stessel, said. ''It's self-policing.''
2003-07-02	Arnold Is Chosen For Amtrak Account	Amtrak has named the McLean, Va., office of Arnold Worldwide to handle creative duties on its account, which had been handled since 2001 by White & Baldacci in Herndon, Va. Billings were estimated at $20 million to $30 million. The decision to award Arnold a two-year contract, starting Oct. 1, came after a required review that lasted two months. The review had been narrowed to Arnold, White & Baldacci and two other finalists: the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and WKP/YPBR in New York. Arnold is part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas.
2003-06-18	Newly Confident Amtrak Showing Signs of Revival	Screeching, clattering and thumping its way along just south of Wilmington, Del., the Amtrak machine lifted and spread the rails, scooped up the rotting wooden ties beneath, plowed away the gravel, plunked down perfect new concrete ties, gently laid the rails back down, and moved on, leaving tracks on which trains will travel at 125 miles an hour, up from 80 miles per hour now. The recent revival of the machine, which had been mothballed for the last few years, is a sign of confidence in the future of the railroad that goes beyond faster trains, lower maintenance costs and longer lasting railroad ties.

2003-05-29	Honesty About Amtrak	This summer, Americans can travel by train without having to fear, as they did last year, that Amtrak may be out of business by Labor Day. Much beyond that, Amtrak's future becomes rather murky. America's approach to passenger rail remains woefully haphazard and shortsighted. The nation's other crucial transportation needs -- like highways, aviation and mass transit -- are all routinely financed, without a Congressional debate every year on their continued existence. Only when it comes to trains must Washington look around for spare change to keep the service running.
2003-05-22	Substance Leads to Penn Station Drama	A Liberian man who provoked the suspicions of the authorities on an Amtrak train on Tuesday -- and spurred the partial evacuation of Pennsylvania Station in New York -- was in federal custody last night facing a charge of illegal immigration. The man was identified by The Associated Press as Nasrat Youssef Kafal. His luggage was searched because officials believed he might be carrying hazardous materials. An official close the investigation, who insisted on anonymity, said last night that the suspicious substance turned out to be cooking oil.
2003-05-06	Struggling Amtrak Is Dealing With New Woe, Loss of Riders	As Amtrak tries to persuade Congress to finance a comprehensive plan to return to a state of good physical repair and fiscal stability over the next five years, it faces a short-term problem: it is losing riders. The railroad is suffering through a national recession that has hit the travel sector especially hard. For the first half of its current fiscal year, ending March 31, ridership was 11.37 million, down from 11.46 million for the same period a year earlier.

2003-03-16	Amtrak Hangs On, Hopeful Once More	AMTRAK is far from healthy, but after its near-death experience last summer, top management is newly hopeful. It has won a federal subsidy for the current fiscal year that is more than 95 percent of the $1.2 billion it asked for -- including some money for long-deferred capital items. But there are strings attached. The first problem is that the money will go through the Transportation Department, which is supposed to provide it to the railroad as grants. David L. Gunn, Amtrak's president, was asked at a recent briefing on the budget whether this created new hoops for the beleaguered railroad to jump through. ''Well, at least we've got a hoop,'' he replied. ''We've never had a hoop before.''
2003-03-09	Bringing Bridges Up to Speed	THE national railroad system's busiest route, the Northeast Corridor, can no longer continue to rely on three Connecticut railroad bridges to carry trains. Replacing the bridges, Amtrak said, is one of its most urgent capital projects, and the railroad last month asked the federal government for $18 million to begin the job. Two of the bridges, on the Niantic River in East Lyme and the Thames River in New London, open for boats and are on the verge of becoming so unreliable that Northeast Corridor passenger trains between New Haven and Boston might have to be a halted, an Amtrak spokesman said.

The accident took place at 12:45 a.m., when the barge struck the central steel beam of the bridge, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for Amtrak. No one was injured, but the bridge, which links Manhattan and the Bronx where the Harlem and Hudson Rivers meet, suffered structural damage and is expected to be out of service until Tuesday, Mr. Stessel said.

2002-11-27	Fight Over Amtrak State Aid Goes Public	A struggle between Amtrak and New York State has flared into public view, with Pataki administration officials accusing the faltering railroad of delaying projects and demanding too much money from the state. Among the consequences of Amtrak's near-bankruptcy, both sides suggest, is that while New York State has invested more than $100 million in high-speed trains linking New York City, Albany and Buffalo, the trains may never be used.
2002-10-08	Deal Revives Delayed Plan For Train Hub	Gov. George E. Pataki has struck an agreement with the United States Postal Service to buy the James A. Farley Building on Eighth Avenue to turn the two-block-long building into a new glass-covered Pennsylvania Station. The agreement would be a major step forward for the nearly 10-year-old, $788 million project, which seeks to transform the post office into a landmark transportation hub for the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit, Amtrak and the subway system. The Farley Building, which is on Eighth Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets, was designed by McKim, Mead & White, architects of the original Pennsylvania Station, which was demolished in the early 1960's in a move that spawned the landmark preservation movement in New York City. Beneath the building lay Amtrak's underground passenger platforms.

2002-09-30	Keep the Trains Running	It is time for Congress and the Bush administration to stop playing games with Amtrak's future. They must either provide national passenger rail service with adequate resources, or acknowledge their failure to give the country the vital transportation network it needs. Until now, House Republicans and the administration have favored a disingenuous third course -- one of appearing to support Amtrak by approving some financing, though clearly not enough, while clamoring for the railroad to reform itself. The administration has requested $521 million for Amtrak's next fiscal year, and the House Appropriations Committee last week signed off on $762 million. Only the Senate has approved the $1.2 billion that Amtrak needs at a minimum.
2002-09-25	Proposal for Ailing Amtrak Cuts 6 Long-Distance Trains	House Republicans who have been holding up money for Amtrak for the fiscal year that begins next week have a new plan that could kill six of the railroad's 41 long-distance routes.

As a precaution, Amtrak and New Jersey Transit suspended service on tracks adjacent to the road and near a tunnel into and out of New York's Pennsylvania Station. James P. Fox, the state transportation commissioner, said that about 9,000 New Jersey Transit commuters on 17 trains were delayed by the 10 a.m. accident, as were 1,000 Amtrak travelers on 5 trains. The gas main was repaired by 12:53 p.m. Ronald Smothers (NYT)
2002-09-05	Metro Briefing | New York: Albany: Amtrak To Lease Station	Amtrak signed a 50-year lease yesterday on the new Rensselaer rail station. Carm Basile, a spokesman for the Capital District Transportation Authority, which owns the station, said Amtrak had agreed to pay a $50,000 annual occupancy fee and provide most of the security for the 67,000-square-foot building. The station cost $53.1 million to build and will probably open in several weeks, Mr. Basile said. Amtrak's annual operating cost for the station is estimated at $430,000. Its current station serves about 630,000 passengers annually, including many lawmakers traveling to the Capitol. Stacy Albin (NYT)

2002-08-21	Amtrak Finds More Cracks in Acelas and Juggles Locomotives	Amtrak faced growing problems yesterday in trying to restore high-speed Acela Express service along the busy Boston-New York-Washington corridor. It used conventional locomotives for four of its eight scheduled trains. Amtrak said its inspectors found hairline cracks early yesterday in the shock-absorbing assemblies of the four locomotives. The assemblies are designed to keep Acela Express locomotives from swaying at high speeds. The eight trains had been scheduled to run after cracks found earlier had been repaired.
2002-08-20	Amtrak's Quicker Trains Again Serve the Northeast	Amtrak restored most of its Acela train service today, but with half of its high-speed fleet still in need of repairs, officials conceded it could be days before the system was fully operational again. Nine repaired locomotives left stations in Washington and Boston this morning, while work continued to fix cracks in the understructure of nine others that serve Amtrak's busy Northeast Corridor.
2002-08-18	Two Railroads, One Company and a Need for Money	Until the last few days, the consensus on Amtrak was that it was two railroads: a sprawling long-distance system doomed to carry tourists at a loss, and a bustling Northeast Corridor line that could meet its costs, or even make a profit, competing with the airlines for business travelers. But that impression was always a myth, the experts say, and last week showed how badly both Amtraks are in trouble.

2002-08-17	Amtrak Halts 20% of Its Runs In the Northeast	Amtrak canceled more than a fifth of its trains in the Northeast today, leaving 10,000 passengers crowded into slower trains or scrambling for other transportation, in a safety move that spread confusion and dismay among riders who are already accustomed to bad news. The railroad managed to maintain service in its busiest and most profitable corridor, from Boston to Washington, after it borrowed locomotives from New Jersey Transit and the suburban railroad that serves Baltimore and Washington, or MARC.
2002-08-17	New Trains, Old Tracks: Bad News	To the Editor: Re ''Amtrak Sidelines More Locomotives Because of Defect'' (front page, Aug. 16): There is a mismatch between the Acela high-speed train and the substandard tracks and roadbed on which it is expected to run. This is a tradition at Amtrak. Years before Acela, Amtrak bought cars that could not negotiate the radius of its curves.
2002-08-16	AMTRAK SIDELINES MORE LOCOMOTIVES BECAUSE OF DEFECT	Amtrak's equipment problems grew today to include locomotives for slower trains that had not been affected by its suspension of the high-speed Acela Express service this week, and the railroad said the few Acela trains it had previously found to be crack-free were damaged, too. Amtrak sidelined the few Acela Express trains that it had planned to use this morning and pulled 15 more locomotives from the same manufacturer that are used on older trains. To keep a full schedule of the older trains, it was forced to borrow locomotives from two commuter lines.
2002-08-16	Fast Train to Nowhere	David Gunn, the man credited with turning around the New York City subway system in the 1980's, has found an equally daunting challenge. Amtrak, which he has led since May, seems to have cornered the market on self-inflicted debacles this year. Just as passenger rail traffic was soaring in the wake of the Sept. 11 airliner hijackings, Amtrak suffered two nasty derailments and the sidelining of its brand-new fleet of high-speed trains. The setbacks, coming at a time when the railroad's future hinges on an upcoming budget showdown in Congress, are serious, and sorely test the patience of even the most fervent supporters of rail travel. But it would be a mistake for the country to give up on the development of a smoothly running passenger rail system to relieve transportation congestion on the East and West Coasts. Cracks that were discovered this week in the suspension systems of high-speed Acela Express locomotives forced Amtrak to suspend use of its newest trains in the Northeast Corridor. The popularity of the Acela, which debuted in late 2000, has shown that there is a strong demand for competitive passenger rail. Even though antiquated tracks along the Washington-Boston run rarely allow the Acela to reach its optimal speed of 150 m.p.h., the sleek trains, for which passengers pay a hefty premium, helped Amtrak gain market share from airline shuttles while earning an operating profit in the Northeast Corridor.
2002-08-15	Amtrak Clears Another High-Speed Train	Amtrak said today that it had completed safety inspections on 16 of its 18 high-speed Acela trains, and had cleared three for service on Thursday, up from two on Wednesday. Inspections have found ''some sort of deficiency'' on 11 of the inspected trains, said Karina Van Veen, a spokeswoman.
2002-08-14	Cracks Cause Amtrak to Halt High-Speed Northeast Trains	Amtrak today suspended its new high-speed Acela, the pride of the struggling railroad's fleet, a few hours after finding cracks in a part designed to keep the locomotives from swaying. Most of the trains seem likely to be out of service for days or weeks. The decision pushed thousands of riders onto slower, older trains traveling between Boston, New York and Washington -- the Northeast Corridor -- and was another blow to the railroad, which so far this year has been through two derailments and a cash crunch so severe that it threatened to close. The two wrecks, on lines to Chicago and Florida, did not involve the high-speed trains but left Amtrak so short of cars that it has had to cannibalize other trains to maintain its long-distance routes.
2002-08-12	New Station at Albany Is Idle; Amtrak Balks at Signing Lease	On a stifling afternoon a few days ago, dozens of Amtrak riders waited in a cramped, well-worn rail station without air-conditioning or a snack bar. Next door, the air-conditioning breezed through a new four-story brick-and-glass station yet to serve a passenger. The old station was to have been closed by now. But after $53 million and three years of construction, its replacement remains dormant because Amtrak has never signed a lease and, struggling financially, considers the rent beyond its means.
2002-08-01	Train Sticks To Schedule As Commuter, Stricken, Dies	A commuter suffered a heart attack on a train here on Tuesday, and officials of Amtrak and the local commuter agency are arguing over why the conductor failed to stop for medical attention and instead continued into Boston, picking up passengers along the way. At least in part, the confusion over what to do may lie in the complicated division of authority over the rail line. The railroad tracks are owned by CSX, the freight company. Amtrak crews operated the train, which was also part of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.
2002-07-31	Derailment Adds to Car Problem; Amtrak Cuts a Run	Amtrak this afternoon dragged away the 11 cars damaged in Monday's derailment of the Capitol Limited, but with nearly 100 wrecked cars already awaiting repair and no spares on hand, the financially beleaguered railroad had to cancel a Washington-to-Chicago train scheduled for Wednesday. And with no prospect of immediate repair, it will either have to cancel many more trains, or spread its surviving cars among more trains, reducing the number of seats and beds available on a variety of long-distance routes.
2002-07-30	Double-Deck Amtrak Train Derails in Maryland, Injuring 97	A double-decker Amtrak train hurtling toward the end of a 19-hour journey from Chicago derailed in this Washington suburb under a blistering sun today, leaving 97 passengers injured, 6 of them seriously. The 13-car train, the Capitol Limited, carrying 161 passengers and 12 crew members, jumped the tracks at 1:55 p.m., 10 minutes after it was due to arrive in Union Station in Washington.
2002-07-15	Putting Rail Back on Track	In a sense, Amtrak's most adamant critics are right. The United States cannot afford to continue like this, cutting its national railroad a check for one hundred million dollars here, a quarter-billion there, merely enabling it to hobble along, from one funding crisis to the next. The nation should be looking at the big picture, investing in an efficient network of passenger rail as a cost-effective means of meeting pressing national transportation needs. This is the crucial, if seemingly odd, point often lost on both sides of the Washington debate over Amtrak's future -- the issue is larger than trains. The strongest case to be made for a vibrant passenger rail network is to think of it as an appendage of the nation's aviation system. Amtrak's supporters in Washington argue that the grounding of all flights after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks showed the need for alternative means of transportation. True enough, but the far more compelling case for developing rail could have been made last Sept. 10, when Americans complained about the paralyzing congestion at airports.
2002-07-12	By Train for a Weekend (You Can Just Fly Back)	THOUGH long abandoned by most vacationers -- as Amtrak's financial struggles show -- rail travel remains one of the most exhilarating, romantic ways to see the United States. Seeing the country at eye level, relaxing to the soothing rhythm of the train, striking up conversations with strangers as you pass through towns you never knew existed -- none of this can be duplicated at 30,000 feet in the sky.

2002-07-07	Amtrak Must Die	Last Sept. 13, I rode Amtrak from Boston to Portland, Ore., on time, with an overflow load of very grateful air-travel refugees. There were no planes flying and no rental cars to be had. The train crew had put in long hours, some dealing with all manner of craziness while working on trains coming through New York City. Yes, there are duds working on Amtrak. But there are also dedicated men and women who delivered the goods during those terrible days of uncertainty and fear. O. Amundsen Port Clyde, Me.
2002-07-07	Amtrak Must Die	The title of John Tierney's article (June 16) assumes that Amtrak was actually alive at some point. Congress has never allowed Amtrak to be more than the warmed-over remains of the private system it replaced. Laurance S. Smith Sacramento, Calif.
2002-07-07	Amtrak Must Die	Perhaps Tierney regards Balkanization, with the prospects of a shutdown, as a terrific first step. But there is a strong case to be made for one national system (without condoning the mediocre service he endured on the Sunset Limited). One option, for example, would be to have a company like Marriott provide on-board services for long-distance runs. Anthony R. Sloan Millbrook, N.Y.

Train ''authorities'' I know could provide a detailed rebuttal. I will provide only one anecdote: On Sept. 12, 2001, I was scheduled to ride Amtrak's Vermonter from Amherst, Mass., to Washington. I was told it was running, but how far nobody knew for certain. The Vermonter stopped at Hell Gate, where we could see the smoke from the ruins of the towers, stopped at Penn Station and again at Newark and continued to Washington, on time. Norman F. Clarke Amherst, Mass.

2002-06-30	New Jersey's Amtrak Blues	THE threatened Amtrak shutdown came and went on Wednesday almost unnoticed by commuters crowding into seats on the way to New York City. The trains kept rolling and, for riders, the threatened closure of the national railroad was just background noise for the daily chore of getting into work on time. The threat might never materialize into anything more than that, but warnings that the rail system would close if Congress and the president do not come up with more money is a frightening scenario for the people who oversee New Jersey's mass transit system -- with its jammed roads and tunnels and many more commuters than bus seats.
2002-06-30	Amtrak Must Die	I read John Tierney's article (June 16) with personal interest and experience. While his description of Amtrak travel is accurate (lateness, poor service), his only prognosis is to declare the patient terminal. During the past 12 years, my wife and I have traveled on every Amtrak route at all times of the year, so we have a good feel for the real problem: Amtrak owns only the tracks between Boston and Washington. It pays ''rent'' elsewhere. That's why train passengers are treated as second-class citizens in the rest of the country, as they are shunted to sidings to let freight trains go by. We have found the facilities and equipment to be more than adequate. If Amtrak owned its tracks, the problems would go away. That's where the money, taxes or private, should be spent. Lee Bracey Wood Ridge, N.J.
2002-06-29	Amtrak to Cut $100 Million in Expenses to Get a Loan	Amtrak agreed last night to the Bush administration's terms for a $100 million loan that will avert an immediate shutdown and promised to find $100 million in expense cuts from next year's budget. The loan will keep Amtrak's passenger trains running through the second week of August, and administration officials said they would quickly ask Congress to come up with another $100 million to $170 million to carry Amtrak through the beginning of the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1.
2002-06-28	Amtrak Halt Only Delayed, Many in Congress Suspect	Congressional supporters and opponents of Amtrak both reacted skeptically today to the Bush administration's agreement to keep the railroad running through September with short-term loans. Both sides expressed concern that a shutdown threat had simply been deferred until next year. David L. Gunn, the president of Amtrak, said it was not even clear that an imminent shutdown had been prevented, because the railroad and the administration had still not reached final agreement. Mr. Gunn said the administration was still insisting on internal changes and other terms that were unacceptable to Amtrak. But, he said, he is ''reasonably hopeful'' the deal will come together in the next few days.
2002-06-27	Deal Could Back Amtrak Through October	Amtrak and the Bush administration reached a tentative agreement last night that would provide enough cash to keep the railroad operating through October, but the deal requires that Congress come up with half of the money. The agreement, reached after three days of negotiations between Amtrak officials and Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta, appears to avert a shutdown of the railroad, which Amtrak had said could occur as soon as July 8. A shutdown would have stranded not only Amtrak's 60,000 daily customers, but also hundreds of thousands of commuters on state-operated lines like New Jersey Transit that use Amtrak's switches and tracks.
2002-06-26	A Threat of Derailment	Reckless brinkmanship in Washington is threatening to disrupt the Northeast's economy and jeopardize millions of Americans' summer travel. The Bush administration has said it will find a way to provide Amtrak with the $200 million it needs to hobble on until the end of the current fiscal year, but it has yet to do so. David Gunn, Amtrak's president, has warned that without a transfusion, the railroad will be forced to shut down. Apart from its failure to attend to Amtrak's immediate needs, the administration has been sluggish about proposing a national rail policy. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta has generally endorsed ideas offered in February by the Congressionally established Amtrak Reform Council. These include ceding policy making to the states while ending Amtrak's passenger monopoly and its ownership of the Northeast corridor tracks. Yet he was alarmingly vague on how to move from today's crisis to the brave new world of competitive rail travel.
2002-06-26	Amtrak Gives Itself 2 Weeks, in a Lightless Tunnel	Amtrak officials said tonight that they had found enough cash to operate for about two more weeks but warned that continued inaction by the White House and Congress would force the railroad to shut down by July 8 or 9. Several days of intensive negotiations with the White House have resulted in promises of about $100 million in loan guarantees, about half of what the nation's passenger railroad needs, said David L. Gunn, the new president of Amtrak. Democrats in Congress have made progress on an emergency infusion of cash for Amtrak, but in neither case have proposals moved far enough to insure continued operations, Mr. Gunn said.
2002-06-25	Amtrak Wheeze, New York Shudder	The worry ricocheting through the New York region's transportation agencies yesterday was that if push came to shove in Amtrak's fight for emergency help from the government, the railroad would not just shut down its own trains, it would park them in the tunnels under Pennsylvania Station. Whether or not such a threat was really uttered in the talks in Washington between Amtrak and Bush administration officials, the very idea points up the little-known but enormously important place Amtrak occupies at the heart of the unwieldy thicket of interconnected agencies that make up the metropolitan area's railroad network.
2002-06-25	MEMO PAD	The Public Likes Rail, If Politicians Don't You may be switching from the plane to the train, but has Congress noticed? In April, Amtrak ridership was up 1.2 percent, while airline ridership was down 13.1 percent, according to the latest available industry data. Ridership on Amtrak's Acela Express and Metroliner trains, which have been carrying more passengers this year than the airline shuttles, was up 54 percent in March. And on Friday, the National Rail Passengers Association issued a report declaring that ''the American public is responding positively to modern, frequent passenger rail service.''
2002-06-25	Administration Vows to Keep Amtrak Going	The Bush administration said today that it would keep Amtrak running beyond a threatened shutdown deadline of Wednesday. But without a clear plan to supply the railroad with cash, Amtrak officials did not pull back from the brink of a halt. If the administration or Congress fails to satisfy Amtrak's need for more than $100 million to keep its passenger trains rolling, railroad officials have said they will shut the system down as early as Wednesday. Such a move could strand Amtrak's 60,000 daily riders and hundreds of thousands of commuters, mostly in the Northeast, who ride train lines that use Amtrak's system.
2002-06-24	Senators Say White House Should Offer Amtrak Help	Democratic United States senators from New York and New Jersey accused the Bush administration yesterday of threatening the economic life of the Northeast by failing to extend an emergency loan guarantee to keep Amtrak trains rolling after a threatened midweek shutdown. Shouting over the Sunday morning din of Pennsylvania Station's rotunda, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and Senators Robert G. Torricelli and Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said that the administration should guarantee the $200 million loan that the rail service says it needs to keep operating until new federal subsidies kick in after Oct. 1.
2002-06-23	Emergency Talks Called Over Amtrak Woes	Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta has scheduled an emergency meeting of Amtrak's board for Monday as the Bush administration works to avert a financial crisis that that the rail service has said could force it begin shutting down operations as soon as Wednesday. In a statement yesterday, the Transportation Department said Mr. Mineta had called the meeting to discuss what steps the government could take to provide assistance to Amtrak, which has said it needs $200 million by early in the week to keep operating.

2002-06-16	Amtrak Must Die	Before we start on Amtrak, I should confess a longstanding bias. I have been praising trains for as long as I have been speaking. In March 1954, at the age of 11 months, I was on the station platform in Lafayette, Ind., when a train from Chicago suddenly appeared around the bend. The sight and sound of the huge diesel locomotive apparently triggered something in my brain. After my grandmother got off the train, I described her arrival by uttering my first sentence. ''Gaga choochoo,'' I said, and went on repeating it for months. The fixation moved on to ''The Little Engine That Could'' and continued through adulthood. I covered the walls of my apartments with paintings of locomotives and rode trains across America and Canada, over the Andes, around Europe. I developed an appreciation for even the miserable trips, like the one on Amtrak's Crescent that ended in New Orleans with an elderly man declaring that his three years in a Russian prison during the Bolshevik Revolution were never this bad. No matter how often Amtrak disappointed, I kept riding. In the hierarchy of train lovers, I was at least a train buff and maybe even a ''rail fan,'' which is the formal term for the ultimate obsessive. The informal term, coined by railroad workers and now used by the obsessives themselves, is ''foamer,'' as in foaming at the mouth.

Amtrak is facing a December deadline, established five years ago, to make enough money to cover its operating expenses. It was making uncertain progress toward that goal before Sept. 11, but the terrorist attacks wrecked all previous plans. Now more people are riding the trains, especially the profitable ones in the Northeast Corridor, the Washington-New York-Boston stretch that is its most popular, so revenues are up, but expenses are up even more, so losses are reaching record levels.

The Downeaster, inaugurated in December, stops along a 115-mile rail corridor at Old Orchard Beach (to begin in June), Saco and Wells in Maine; Dover, Durham and Exeter in New Hampshire; and Haverhill in Massachusetts before reaching North Station in Boston. The move to restore passenger service to Maine began 10 years ago with a citizens' petition of 100,000 signatures. The state responded by forming and financing a new passenger service called the Downeaster, operated by Amtrak. Four round trips are offered daily of 2 hours 44 minutes duration each way, and the train has a cafe car. The round-trip fare from Portland to Boston is $42, $35 for same-day travel. Reservations: (800) 872-7245 or www.thedowneaster.com. FRAN HANDMAN
2002-03-03	Tug Accident Closes Bridge, Halting Trains	The last rites for a stack of New York City subway cars destined for burial at sea were put off yesterday when a barge carrying the cars, known as Redbirds, was involved in an accident on the Harlem River, the authorities said. Around noon, a tugboat that was moving the barge struck the Spuyten Duyvil railroad bridge where the Harlem meets the Hudson River. The accident disrupted Amtrak service to upstate New York, closed the Harlem River to recreational and commercial boat traffic and forced the barge to abort a trip to Delaware, where the subway cars are to serve as artificial reefs, the authorities said.
2002-02-24	America's Rails: Seeking Direction	To the Editor: What you call Washington's ''fundamental policy choices'' in a Feb. 19 editorial about Amtrak would be a matter of common sense for any business person. Of course Amtrak should abandon unprofitable routes and continue its investment in profitable ones like the Northeast Corridor.
2002-02-24	America's Rails: Seeking Direction	To the Editor: The Amtrak Reform Council's restructuring plan (editorial, Feb. 19) is radically simple, and disastrous. It entails separating the ownership of infrastructure, including the Northeast Corridor, which would be divested and conveyed to a new governmental entity.
2002-02-24	America's Rails: Seeking Direction	To the Editor: Re ''Rethinking Rail Travel'' (editorial, Feb. 19): I agree that Amtrak has to do ''too much with too little,'' but Congress should study its financial performance before it starts writing big checks. Unfortunately, Amtrak's recent balance sheets and business plans remain unavailable to federal oversight agencies and members of Congress.
2002-02-24	America's Rails: Seeking Direction	To the Editor: Re ''Rethinking Rail Travel'' (editorial, Feb. 19): My weekly commute between New York and Washington is about to end. While I am relieved, I will miss Amtrak. My trip has improved so much over the year that the the main drawback of Amtrak now is that the trains are crowded.
2002-02-23	National Briefing | Washington: Amtrak Elects New Chairman	In a unanimous vote, the seven-member board of Amtrak elected Mayor John R. Smith of Meridian, Miss., as its chairman. Mr. Smith, a Republican who has been mayor since 1993, has been on the Amtrak board since 1998 and is a member of the Transportation Committee of the United States Conference of Mayors. He takes over at a difficult time for Amtrak, which faces downsizing and eliminating routes, depending on Congressional appropriations. He succeeds Tommy G. Thompson, who became secretary of health and human services in May.
2002-02-21	Metro Briefing | New York: Queens: Amtrak Workers Charged In Phone Scheme	Eighteen Amtrak workers have been charged with using credit and telephone calling cards lost or forgotten by Amtrak passengers to place $100,000 worth of calls from telephones on the trains. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said yesterday that some employees face up to 15 years in prison. From 1997 to 2000, the employees placed 47,000 minutes of long-distance and international calls, the authorities said. The employees, accused of criminal possession of stolen property and other charges, repaired and cleaned trains at Amtrak's train yard in Sunnyside, Queens. Sarah Kershaw (NYT)
2002-02-20	Across the Great Divide	When I went to Chicago for a wedding a few years ago, I decided to spare myself the agonies of air travel and take the train. I booked a first-class sleeping compartment on the Empire Builder, one of Amtrak's most historic trains, which travels more than 2,000 miles over the Cascades and across the Great Plains. Since then, I've taken the Empire Builder half a dozen times, and the stops along the way -- places like Havre, Mont., Minot, N.D., and Red Wing, Minn. -- have become for me more than abstractions on a map. Traveling by train, I've spent time with people I would never have met otherwise. Once in Havre, I played poker at 8 o'clock in the morning with an elderly rancher I'd had dinner with on the train the night before. The Empire Builder makes an hourlong morning stop in Havre, and when I got out to stretch my legs, the rancher hurried over, grabbed my hand and asked if I would be so kind as to escort her to a small casino a few blocks from the station. She didn't want to go by herself, she explained, because it isn't ladylike to gamble alone so early in the morning. We talked politics at dinner the night before and in the casino that morning; she was a straight, pro-life Bush supporter, and I am a gay, pro-choice Gore voter -- and we got along famously.
2002-02-19	Rethinking Rail Travel	The nation's highway system does not make a profit. Nor does the commercial aviation system. Nor does passenger rail. However, only one of these three vital links in America's transportation network, the railroad, is being asked to break even. Congress must abandon its fantasy that Amtrak can be self-sufficient. Only then can it engage in an honest debate about the kind of passenger rail system the country needs, and how to pay for it. In 1997, in exchange for meager subsidies, Congress required that Amtrak be ''operationally self-sufficient'' by December of this year, or else. It is ''or else'' time, and the Amtrak Reform Council, created by the same law, is calling for radical restructuring. The council suggests that Amtrak be broken up into a regulatory agency, a regional body to assume ownership of the Northeast corridor track and an operating company. It would also like to open up certain routes to private competitors.
2002-02-17	Airline and Amtrak Link Service at Newark	Amtrak and Continental have entered an agreement that will allow passengers to make one reservation to book their flight as well as travel on Amtrak's Keystone or Acela Regional service between Newark International Airport and four cities -- Philadelphia; Wilmington, Del.; and New Haven and Stamford, Conn. The travel package, which can include the train one way or round trip, will be available in mid-March.
2002-02-14	BOLDFACE NAMES	Accounting: Now It Can Be Told Before the Enron bankrupcty, would any publishing houses have given serious thought to a proposal for a tell-all book about an accounting firm? Would anyone have offered an advance in the mid-six figures? But now CHARLES CONRAD, vice president and executive editor of Broadway Books, has signed for a book about Arthur Andersen, Enron's longtime auditor. The book, ''Our People: How Arthur Andersen Won Big Business and Lost Its Way,'' is being written by BARBARA LEY TOFFLER, a former partner-in-charge of Arthur Andersen's ethics and responsible business practices consulting service.
2002-02-10	Track Mishap Causes Massive Train Delays	Thousands of passengers on Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains were delayed or stranded last night after a freight train damaged overhead wires near Linden, N.J., bringing service to a near standstill from Washington to Boston. By early this morning, hundreds of frustrated passengers were waiting for service in Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station and other stops along the nation's busiest rail corridor, while others had scrambled to find alternatives in buses or taxis.
2002-02-08	Advisory Panel Tells Congress That Amtrak Should Be Split	A panel created by Congress in 1997 to advise on the future of Amtrak said today that the railroad should be broken up and that the job of running trains should be opened to competition. But most of its members quickly added that their report was unlikely to be more than a starting point for a national debate, involving federal, state and local governments, on what to do about passenger rail.
2002-02-03	Ideas & Trends; Amtrak: Nothing Like It in the World, So Far	AMTRAK'S new Acela trains can dash from New York to Washington at a top speed of 150 miles an hour. Sleek and shiny, they represent the pinnacle of American passenger rail, Amtrak's defiant response to critics who say the government wasted $25 billion over the last 30 years preserving a national railroad. But does the Acela really show how far railroads have advanced in 30 years, or how little things have changed? When Amtrak was formed in 1971, it inherited the Metroliner, which could go 160 m.p.h. but did so only in tests, because tracks were too far gone. Three decades later, track conditions are still so poor that Acela rarely runs at its own top speed, let alone that of its predecessor.
2002-02-02	Amtrak Sets Austerity Plan And Seeks Aid	Facing mounting debts, Amtrak announced a sweeping austerity plan yesterday while threatening to end legendary long-haul passenger routes like the Empire Builder if Congress does not provide $1.2 billion in financing next year. To cut costs, Amtrak will eliminate 1,000 union and management jobs, about 4 percent of its national work force. It will also defer station improvements and limit the refurbishment of rail cars to urgent repairs. Ticket window hours at 73 of the least-used rail stations in the nation will be shortened, while spending for advertising, marketing and research will be reduced.
2002-01-24	Technology Briefing | Internet: Online On the Rails	Amtrak, with help from Yahoo and Compaq Computer, began offering free wireless Internet service on some of its trains. The service is available on Amtrak's Acela Regional, between Washington and Boston; the Capitols, between Sacramento, Oakland and San Jose; and the Hiawatha, between Chicago and Milwaukee. Amtrak mounted Compaq iPAQ Pocket personal computers on the trains, with Yahoo providing wireless connections. While electrical outlets for laptops are scattered throughout the trains, the interactive service is available only on the Compaq machines, which are in one car of each train, an Amtrak spokeswoman said.
2002-01-11	Panel Is to Propose Breaking Up Amtrak	Amtrak, the money-losing national railroad, should be broken up, with the government taking ownership of the tracks and competing companies taking over some or all of the most popular train routes, a plan to be unveiled today says. Competition would be encouraged, long-haul lines could be put out to bid, and Amtrak itself would have to become more accountable under proposals by the Amtrak Reform Council, which was created by Congress to come up with a restructuring plan if Amtrak failed to become self-sufficient.
2001-12-22	National Briefing | Washington: Bill Would Force Amtrak To Act	A Florida Republican has introduced legislation in the House to force the restructuring or liquidation of Amtrak, which is projected to lose $1 billion in the current year. The bill by Representative John L. Mica, a member of the Transportation Committee, would transfer ownership of two profit-making corridors, Washington-Boston and the Virginia-Florida Auto Train, to the Transportation Department and, ultimately, to the private sector and the states.

2001-12-22	Amtrak Deserves Aid	To the Editor: ''Lobby Groups Find Congress in Giving Mood'' (front page, Dec. 18) is a story that is both appalling and tragic. After Sept. 11, it is essential that we move forward in a positive way, instead of bailing out companies and programs that have used the terror attacks as an excuse for their own managerial shortcomings.
2001-12-07	Newark Airport Innovations Receive a Public Unveiling	In muted ceremonies, Newark International Airport today showcased two new features that had been scheduled for a grander unveiling until the terror attacks provoked a greater concern for airport security. One is a new rail-link station that connects New Jersey Transit commuter lines and Amtrak trains with a one-mile-long monorail spur leading into the airport's passenger terminals. Opened with no fanfare on Oct. 22 by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the connection is the first train-to-plane service at any of the region's three major airports.
2001-11-27	Metro Briefing | New York: New Rochelle: Amtrak Service Restored	Normal service was restored yesterday to Amtrak's Washington-New York-Boston route after a Sunday rail accident outside New York City cut off power and delayed trains for hours. A derailed CSX Corporation freight train hit a pole connected to an electrical supply wire, leading to a power failure that affected 10 miles of Amtrak-owned tracks from New York City to New Rochelle. Passengers traveling between New York and Boston on Sunday faced delays of more than two hours, as diesel engines were temporarily used to tow the electric trains to their stations.

2001-11-25	Two if by Rail	To the Editor: The chart entitled ''How Punctual Is Amtrak?'' (Travel Advisory, Sept. 9) inspired me to write about the excellent experience my husband and I had in April, when we took Amtrak around the United States. Starting with the Crescent in New York City, we arrived on time in New Orleans. The Sunset Limited from New Orleans arrived one hour earlier than scheduled in Los Angeles. The Coast Starlight was on time from Los Angeles into Seattle.
2001-11-17	Death on West Side Tracks	A man was killed yesterday after he was apparently struck by an Amtrak train in a Manhattan railroad underpass at 53rd Street, between 10th Avenue and 11th Avenue, the police said. Information on the accident remained sketchy last night, with the police saying only that the man, whom they declined to identify, was in his 30s. A police report issued last night said he was ''apparently struck'' at about 2:20 p.m. by a southbound Amtrak train, and was pronounced dead on the scene.
2001-10-28	Travel Advisory: Correspondent's Report; Can Amtrak Cope With Heavier Traffic?	DECIDING whether to drive, fly or take the train, travelers have always balanced price, schedule and comfort, but now most are also thinking about security. Amtrak, sizing up its situation, has found that it has some natural advantages over the airlines, some improvements it can make, and some problems it can do nothing about. One key advantage is that it is nearly impossible to barge into an engineer's cab the way hijackers entered airplane cockpits on Sept. 11. On most Amtrak trains the cab is inaccessible from the passenger cars when the train is moving. On the few where there is a passageway, as on the new Acela Express, the railroad has instituted procedures to be certain the engineer will not open the cab to intruders. And conductors, dispatchers and engineers are in nearly continuous radio contact. And unlike a plane, a train with a problem on board can always stop. But Amtrak cannot control access to its stations and trains the way airlines can control access to their aircraft. ''Except for the aviation system, every other transportation system is open,'' said William Schulz, a spokesman for the railroad. Scheduled passenger planes fly only from airports, and access to these can be limited; in contrast, Amtrak trains run from stations they share with commuter trains, with thousands of other passengers. And airlines can limit what passengers may carry on, forcing passengers to put potential weapons into checked baggage; Amtrak checks very few bags. It also runs over vulnerable track. In October 1995, the Sunset Limited, going to Los Angeles from Miami, derailed in Hyder, Ariz., killing one person and injuring 100; the F.B.I. concluded that the track had been sabotaged, but has not found the culprit. Still, the railroad has taken a variety of steps. It has posted workers to guard bridges, tunnels and switches. It has put its 325 police officers -- nearly all of whom carry guns and have arrest powers -- on 12-hour shifts, and canceled their vacations. And to be able to match ticket buyers with government lists of suspects, it has dropped a plan for conductors to sell tickets on its trains between Washington and Boston, and required customers at the station ticket windows to show a picture I.D. It has also stepped up bomb screening on the packages it carries. Amtrak asked Congress for $515 million for a variety of other improvements, including more closed-circuit television equipment, motion detectors and fencing, 150 more police officers, and another 250 security officers, guards who work in areas not accessible to the public. And on Oct. 17 the Senate Commerce Committee approved a Rail Security Act that would provide $515 million for security, half of it for the Northeast corridor, and $998 million for ''life safety projects'' in tunnels in New York, Baltimore and Washington, including new emergency exits. It was not clear when the full Senate and the House would act. While Amtrak officials do not want to seem to gloat, the problems for the airlines have helped the railroad in three ways. One is an upturn in business. Ridership had been declining in late summer, as a national economic slowdown cut the amount of travel. But when the planes stopped flying, Amtrak saw an immediate bump, and even after all of those stranded at airports around the country found their way home, Amtrak's ridership stayed up. On the Northeast Corridor, from Washington through New York to Boston, which accounts for 55 percent of Amtrak's passenger revenue, ridership is up 20 to 25 percent over last year. Nationally, many long-distance trains are selling out, meaning that demand may be significantly higher than Amtrak can meet.. Amtrak's early-morning Acela trains between Washington and New York carried relatively few passengers before Sept. 11 and managers were considering shifting them to other hours; now they often sell out. On Friday afternoons and Sunday nights, the Northeast Direct trains between Washington and Boston, on which reservations are not taken, have people standing or sitting in the aisles. Amtrak has added what extra passenger cars it has, and is asking Congress for money to rehabilitate more. The Twilight Shoreliner, an overnight train between Boston and Washington, is often sold out, as are many other long-distance trains. Metroliners sell out between Washington and New York, and again between New York and Boston. A second benefit for Amtrak was an opportunity to show its best side to Congress, which still holds the purse strings. About 120 members of the House of Representatives and 40 members of the Senate rode special Acela trains from Washington nonstop to New York to visit the wreckage of the World Trade Center, and Amtrak hopes they were impressed by its fastest, quietest, most luxurious train. The third benefit, railroad officials hope, is that the airline bailout has strengthened their argument that there is nothing wrong with using tax dollars to help pay for a national passenger rail system. There is a catch. Ticket revenues may be up sharply, Mr. Schulz said, but security expenses are up by at least as much.
2001-10-07	Travel Advisory; Exploring California By Way of a Rail Pass	Visitors to California have another way to explore the state: Amtrak's California Rail Pass, a statewide ticket that permits seven days of train travel over a 21-day period. Travelers can go anywhere in the state served by Amtrak or Amtrak Thruway buses, including Yosemite National Park and Palm Springs, for $159. For those whose travels are concentrated in the northern or southern part of the state, Amtrak offers a regional pass for up to five days of travel during seven contiguous days.
2001-09-26	The Vast Arsenal Against a Shadowy Foe; New York Tableaus	To the Editor: Re ''Trains Need Help, Too'' (editorial, Sept. 25):
2001-09-25	Trains Need Help, Too	Stranded travelers made a fortuitous discovery when the airlines shut down after the terrorist attacks: The country still has an intercity rail system. Amtrak scrambled to provide additional service to accommodate the surge in demand. In the Washington-New York corridor, Amtrak's stylish new high-speed Acela Express trains are especially busy because of the continued shutdown of Washington's Reagan National Airport. Congress has acted admirably to help the troubled airlines. But it should also make a commitment to improve passenger rail. Amtrak, which receives about 1 percent of all federal transportation spending, needs an immediate infusion of cash to beef up security throughout its system and to accelerate much-needed capital improvements along the Northeast corridor, where its fast trains are hampered by antique infrastructure.
2001-09-25	Newly Popular In Disaster's Wake, Amtrak Seeks U.S. Aid	When Tom Daschle, Edward M. Kennedy and other senators came to New York on Thursday to see for themselves the destruction caused by the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, they decided for logistical and security reasons not to travel by plane. Instead, like many Americans over the last week or so, they rode the rails, glad to have an alternative to flying, but unsure about the long-term future of Amtrak, the nation's 22,000-mile intercity rail system. Since the attacks, tens of thousands of jittery air travelers have bought Amtrak tickets either because their flights were canceled or they could not bear the thought of boarding a plane so soon.
2001-09-23	Trains With a Volcano View	TRAVELERS have long since given up hope of there ever being a viable Northwest Passage. But a Northwest Corridor is a different story.
2001-09-09	How Punctual is Amtrak?	A major reason trains run late, Amtrak says, is that almost all of its tracks are owned and operated by freight railroads, which control scheduling. Amtrak's definition of on time is based on the length of the journey. Trains that travel 500 miles or less are considered on time if they arrive within 15 minutes of the scheduled time; those that travel 501 miles or more are on time if they are 30 minutes late. Here is the average for each route in both directions.
2001-08-23	State Faults Amtrak for Neglect of Tunnels	A state transportation report on Pennsylvania Station accuses Amtrak of neglecting costly improvements to 15 miles of potentially dangerous tunnels that serve the passenger station, the busiest in the country. The report suggests that Amtrak, the federally subsidized railroad that owns the tunnels, was more interested in pursuing projects like the new Acela high-speed rail service and the redevelopment of the James A. Farley Building across Eighth Avenue. It blames Amtrak for not correcting fire and safety problems in the tunnels, some of which were identified as early as 1978.

But the head of Amtrak testified that he found the mandate to end the railroad's losses, while running unprofitable trains at the same time, irrational, frustrating and ''wacky.''
2001-07-18	Vallone Would Aid City Riders By Adding Suburban Train Stops	Saying that New York was alone among large cities in having decreased its train track mileage since the 1940's, Peter F. Vallone outlined a plan yesterday to expand city train service using existing tracks and stations. ''It's expensive, but it's doable,'' said Mr. Vallone, the City Council speaker and a Democrat who is running for mayor. He estimated that the cost of reopening the stations would be from several hundred thousand dollars to $20 million. ''These are existing rail lines that we should be talking about reopening service which once was available to the people of the City of New York,'' he said.
2001-07-15	Amtrak Adds More Narrated Tours	Trails and Rails, Amtrak's program of narrated tours in partnership with the National Park Service, has been expanded to include portions of the Vermonter and the Adirondack train routes on Saturday, Sunday and holiday Mondays. The program, which educates riders on the natural and cultural heritage of the national parks they are traveling through, is offered on the Vermonter as it winds through the Green Mountains, between Amherst, Mass., and Burlington and Essex Junction, Vt. On the Adirondack, the narration is presented as the train moves up the Hudson Valley between Yonkers and Hudson, N.Y., and goes through the mountains between Saratoga Springs and Westport.

Reservations must be made by Aug. 24, with reservations made at least a week ahead of the trip, and the tickets must be paid for at least three days ahead; this offer is not valid on July 4 or on trips on the Acela and Northeast Corridor trains; other restrictions apply, too. The 30 percent discount cannot be used with any other special offer, except for an Auto Train offer for children 2 to 15. Under that deal, children pay 25 percent of the regular fare while adults pay 70 percent on the train, which runs between Lorton, Va., just south of Washington, and Sanford, Fla., near Orlando.

Departures from Washington will be at 5 a.m., 7 a.m., 7:25 a.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. From New York, departures for Washington will be at 7:30 a.m., 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 3:50 p.m., 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. Amtrak will also add another weekday round trip between New York and Boston on Acela Express, with trains departing from Boston's South Station at 6:12 a.m., 7:12 a.m., 3:12 p.m., 5:12 p.m. and 6:42 p.m. From New York, departures for Boston will be at 7:03 a.m., 8:03 a.m., 10:03 a.m., 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.
2001-06-10	FIVE QUESTIONS for GEORGE WARRINGTON; Amtrak, Pulled in Two Directions	AMTRAK is again in serious financial trouble, and last week, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta disclosed that the railroad was trying to mortgage part of Penn Station in New York to make ends meet until the next fiscal year begins in October. He suggested that the railroad consider giving up its national system and concentrate on the East and West Coasts, plus service from Chicago to Detroit, New Orleans and a few other cities. George Warrington, Amtrak's president, was not thrilled to hear that from the secretary, whom President Bush is expected to appoint soon to Amtrak's board. Mr. Warrington has been pursuing an opposite strategy of adding service, while asserting for months that Amtrak should be free of federal operating subsidies by 2003. On Friday, he discussed some of his proposals. MATTHEW L. WALD

2001-05-07	Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Jersey City: Train Service Is Restored	Service on Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains between New York and New Jersey was restored early yesterday, after being halted Saturday night by a rare snag in the overhead power lines. An apparatus that conducts electricity became entangled with power lines at 9:30 p.m. in Jersey City, said Ken Miller, a New Jersey Transit spokesman. He said the cause of the problem was under investigation. Because of previously scheduled maintenance, Mr. Miller said the track had been the only one in service between the two states, so passengers had to ride PATH trains linking Manhattan to terminals in Newark or Hoboken before the wires were repaired.
2001-05-06	Malfunction Cuts Train Service to Newark	Service on Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains was halted for more than two hours between Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan and Newark last night after electrical equipment became snagged on a train near Newark, according to an Amtrak spokeswoman. The malfunction, on a New Jersey Transit train, occurred at 9:08 p.m., and halted trains in both directions, said Cecilia Cummings, the railroad spokeswoman. By early today, service had not resumed.
2001-04-29	Amtrak to Begin Weekend Acela Service	Amtrak will add its new Acela Express trains to the Washington-Boston route on weekends beginning today. The weekend trains make the run in 6 hours 50 minutes, compared with about eight and a half hours on conventional trains. On Saturdays and Sundays, the premium service, with business-class and first-class cars only, will leave Boston South Station twice a day, at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., arriving in Washington after stops in Back Bay, Route 128, Providence, New Haven, Stamford, New York, Newark, Metropark, Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore. Going north on weekends, an Acela Express will leave Washington at 1 p.m., stopping in New York at 4:03 and arriving in Boston at 7:45 p.m. Another northbound train will originate in New York at 8:03 a.m., arriving in Boston at 11:47 a.m.
2001-04-21	Big Brother, Again	To the Editor: I was surprised to read an April 19 letter writer say he had no objection to Amtrak's providing the Drug Enforcement Administration with information about its passengers because he had ''nothing to hide.'' Presumably, that letter writer would also not object to being stopped and searched by a police officer on the street or to a warrantless search of his house. Does he also suspect that those who would object have something to hide? PETER PERSOFF Piedmont, Calif., April 19, 2001

2001-03-13	Planes, Trains, And a Vintage Cab; The Runner-Up	The electronic signs inside Amtrak's brand-new Acela Express train yesterday morning read ''welcome aboa.'' I was hoping this was a good thing. I was hoping it meant that the Amtrak people were in too much of a hurry to finish the thought. Then came other worries. The motorized stainless steel doors at the end of my car kept opening and closing on their own, like a pair of shears. An official-looking man in a white hard hat, carrying a laptop computer, kept making his way down the aisle with a worried expression on his face. The lights in the cars kept blinking off and on.
2001-03-04	Amtrak at Issue	To the Editor: Before we condemn Amtrak for its inability to match European speeds and costs, we should understand that Federal Railroad Administration requirements make the Acela nearly twice the weight per passenger of the French T.G.V. and the German, Italian and Swedish equivalents. This means more fuel cost, more wear and tear on tracks, and an arguably small benefit in safety. One wonders if the money spent on heft were diverted to trackside technology, would not safety, speed and cost all benefit? GEORGE BAILEY Sharon, Mass. Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, responds: Mr. Bailey's statement about Acela Express's weight is accurate; the weight is a direct result of its safety features. Acela Express is made of stainless steel; the T.G.V. of aluminum. The T.G.V. achieves most of its safety by running on a dedicated line; Acela Express is obligated to run with commuter and freight trains. Amtrak devoted a significant sum to trackside technology in rebuilding tne New England section of the Northeast Corridor, including a new signal system that controls the speed of the train and can automatically stop it.
2001-03-04	Amtrak at Issue	To the Editor: While I am also a frequent critic of Amtrak's service and pricing, a recent report in the Business Day section of The New York Times gives some perspective. Deutsche Bahn, one of the European rail services so admired by Americans, has been operated by the German government at an annual loss estimated at $2 billion. This is in contrast to Amtrak's attempt to operate without subsidy within the next few years. So, unless we demand the restoration of federal subsidies for Amtrak, and insist on paying European tax rates to finance it, we will have to be tolerant of what we have. PETER PESCE New York, N.Y.
2001-03-04	Amtrak at Issue	To the Editor: I frequently take the shuttle plane from Boston to New York. I have found the delays and travel unbearable. After reading Betsy Wade's article about her wonderful time, ''The New Acela: An Assessment'' (Jan. 21), I decided to try that. On the Acela Express 2150 from New York to Back Bay in Boston, the service was excellent, the food was outstanding, far better than anything I have had on an airline, and the train left and arrived on time. My experience on the way back was even better. I shall give up my weekly air shuttle to Boston and board the Acela! JUDITH MORRIS BOUSQUET Brooklyn
2001-03-04	Amtrak at Issue	To the Editor: Regarding Margaret Murphy's letter about her unfortunate train trip (''Long Acela Trip,'' Feb. 11), I feel obliged to point out that Ms. Murphy had her experience on the Acela Regional, not the high-speed Acela Express.
2001-02-14	Amtrak Chooses A New Agency	Amtrak said yesterday that it had selected the New York office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, as the agency for its account, which had been handled for more than 25 years by the New York office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Billings were estimated at more than $35 million.
2001-02-11	Long Acela Trip	To the Editor: On Jan. 21, I had reservations on the 6:55 p.m. Acela Regional from Boston to New York. Five minutes out, all the lights went out and we stopped for 20 minutes. The conductor said the engine was being ''recycled.'' This occurred twice more.
2001-02-06	61 Injured As 2 Trains Collide Near Syracuse	An Amtrak train en route to Pennsylvania Station from Niagara Falls struck the rear of a CSX freight train and derailed just east of Syracuse yesterday, injuring 61 people, at least 10 seriously, the authorities said. Neither Amtrak nor federal officials had determined the cause of the collision last night. Cecilia Cummings, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said officials on the scene were investigating whether the train was as much as 15 minutes late when the collision occurred.
2001-02-05	Amtrak Proposes to Triple Capital Spending	Executives at Amtrak, focused for much of the last few years on the railroad's short-term survival, have caught their breath sufficiently to produce a new long-term capital plan. It calls for almost tripling the rate of investment for the next 20 years to build a rail alternative to crowded skies and highways around the country. In an independent move, Amtrak's backers in Congress, who failed last year to get any capital aid, are trying again, with a proposal for issuing $12 billion in bonds over 10 years for Amtrak capital projects.
2001-02-04	Assessing Acela	To the Editor: As a Boston native, I am, of course, delighted that the new Acela Express train reduces the time between New York and Boston to three and a half hours. And yet even the new service, by European standards, is a joke.
2001-02-04	Assessing Acela	To the Editor: Betsy Wade reported without comment that she overheard fellow passengers using their cell phones to admonish contractors and to gossip. Until peace and quiet are included among the amenities of this new service, I'll take the bus. JEANNE SAFER New York, N.Y.
2001-02-04	Assessing Acela	To the Editor: I am an Amtrak traveler. I encourage friends to ride the train. Of course, I have not had any luck getting them on a train. Not even my husband! I ride the train to vacation destinations and he flies. That means I have left days earlier to meet him. CAROL HASLETT Cleveland Heights, Ohio
2001-02-04	Assessing Acela	To the Editor: Betsy Wade's glowing account of the new Amtrak Acela service reminded me of how far Amtrak's service had fallen on the New York-Boston corridor. When I regularly used the New Haven Railroad's service over 40 years ago, the fastest New York-Boston trains were scheduled for about four hours. This is an hour faster than many of Amtrak's current Northeast Direct trains, and the same as Amtrak's new Acela Regional trains. Locomotive changes in New Haven took only 5 minutes or less, not the 20 minutes Ms. Wade quotes from recent schedules.
2001-02-04	Assessing Acela	To the Editor: Regarding ''The New Acela: An Assessment (Practical Traveler, Jan. 21): What a disappointment the Acela Express has been for those of us who commute weekly and who were hoping to have a faster train at a reasonable price. Gaining half an hour on the Greyhound bus and paying triple the price for a 231-mile trip can hardly be considered a good deal. A New York-Boston round trip on Greyhound costs $78 and the ride takes about four hours. And having three choices for breakfast on the Acela at a cost of $240 for the round trip to gain 45 minutes over the regular train can seem trivial.
2001-02-02	3,000-Mile Trip for 2 Boys And a Nightmare of Abuse	The cross-country search for two little boys and their mother began on New Year's Day in Brooklyn with reports of abuse that caused child protection authorities to fear for the children's lives. The police in California joined the hunt on Jan. 9, on a tip that the woman, who had served time in prison for stabbing the boys' father, was staying at a cheap hotel in Inglewood, near Los Angeles. But when investigators closed in, she and her sons, 7 and 8, were already gone. Ten days later, the housekeeping staff at another Inglewood hotel found blood on the walls of the room the family had just vacated -- and cleaned it up without calling the police.
2001-01-11	Metro Business Briefing; FIBER-OPTIC RAIL PLAN	GPU Inc., the New Jersey utility, said it had reached an agreement with Amtrak to build a fiber-optic network linking six cities along some of the railroad's lines in the Northeast. GPU's Telcom Services subsidiary will build the 375-mile network along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line, between New York and Washington, and along its Keystone line, between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pa. The network will also cover Newark and Baltimore. GPU will string fiber cable using the railroad's existing poles, said David Brauer, the president of Telcom Services. Terms of the 15-year lease were not disclosed.
2000-12-24	Train Delays in New Jersey	An Amtrak signal wire struck by a falling tree in Metuchen, N.J., yesterday caused delays of several hours on trains in the region. New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast Line trains were delayed up to three hours between New Brunswick and Newark, starting at 10:15 a.m., said Anna Farneski, a transit spokeswoman. At least 25 trains run by New Jersey Transit were affected, and all the trains were running again by 9 p.m.
2000-12-19	Penn Station Needs Millions For Repairs	Federal transportation inspectors said yesterday that it would take 30 years to correct fire and safety deficiencies in the tunnels that serve Pennsylvania Station unless $898 million can be found to speed up the work. Even then, the inspectors said, the alterations could not be completed before 2010. The timetable, laid out in a report by the inspector general of the Department of Transportation, was considerably more pessimistic than estimates made earlier this year by Amtrak, which owns the station. Several railroad officials had said the potentially disastrous conditions could be corrected by 2014 with no extra money, and a consultant for the railroad recently estimated that it would take only five years if the money were available now.
2000-12-17	Amtrak Offers Rewards For Frequent Riders	Airline passengers have been doing it for years, and now Amtrak riders can do it, too. On Nov. 29 the railroad introduced a rewards program that allows frequent travelers to earn points good for rail and plane travel, hotel stays and merchandise. The Amtrak program, called Guest Rewards, began the same day as did ticket sales for the new high-speed Acela service in the Northeast. The points earned in the program can be redeemed not only for Amtrak tickets but also for flights on United, Continental and Midwest Express; hotel rooms at Hilton, Starwood and Marriott properties; Hertz car rentals; merchandise at such retailers as Barnes & Noble, Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Eddie Bauer; or at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants.
2000-12-11	The Return of Stylish, Speedy Trains	Amtrak hopes today's launch of its Acela Express high-speed service to Washington and Boston will restore rail travel to its former glory. The Acela is meant to become a convenient and trendy alternative to the airline shuttles. The sleek new stainless-steel train is getting rave reviews for its design and creature comforts. Though still lethargic by European and Japanese standards, the Acela Express will cut travel time from New York to Boston to three and a quarter hours. The trip to Washington will be two and a half hours.
2000-12-10	As New Penn Station Proceeds, Officials Say Tunnel Problems Tempt Fate	With New York officials planning to lay the cornerstone next month for a grand expansion of Pennsylvania Station, federal transportation inspectors are hurriedly preparing a report about potentially disastrous fire and safety conditions in 16 miles of aging tunnels that serve the station. More than 750 trains carrying 300,000 passengers use the tunnels each day, but emergency access is through 90-year-old spiral staircases, some of which are 2 feet wide and 10 flights high, the inspectors said. The staircases are so inadequate that firefighters and paramedics would be unable to enter the tunnels at the same time passengers were being evacuated, they said.
2000-11-27	Amtrak Starts To Police Rails From Air	Amtrak has begun to police its tracks from the skies with a helicopter leased with money forfeited by drug dealers. The Amtrak police put a sergeant and a hired pilot aboard the helicopter, a Bell Jet Ranger, to ride above the rails from Boston to Washington.
2000-11-22	All Aboard! (Better Late Than Never)	To the Editor: As Amtrak's new high-speed Acela Express rolls into Boston one year behind schedule (news article, Nov. 17), we might pause to consider that such service is decades behind international standards.
2000-11-22	All Aboard! (Better Late Than Never)	To the Editor: Re ''High-Speed Train Makes Flashy Debut'' (news article, Nov. 17):
2000-11-17	High-Speed Train Makes Flashy Debut	Part airliner and part living room, Amtrak's new Acela Express made its debut yesterday morning on a run from Washington to Boston. The high-speed train has overhead bins like a Boeing, but much deeper and easier to reach, and windows and curtains like those in a country house. It is quiet and smooth and cruises past cars and trucks as though they were standing still. The seats recline, even the ones at the bulkhead; the reading lights have two brightness settings and there are headphone jacks at each seat, and handy electric outlets.
2000-11-15	Amtrak Is Putting Its Hope On a Successful Acela Express	The sleek Acela Express that Amtrak will roll out on Thursday is supposed to move more than just well-heeled passengers between Washington and Boston; it is supposed to carry the railroad a long way toward self-sufficiency, which Congress has insisted it reach by 2002. The railroad, created in 1971 when Congress fused the failing passenger operations of several freight lines, has enjoyed a small boom recently, with record passenger levels and ticket revenues. It has begun carrying mail and express packages, and makes money by running commuter railroads and doing maintenance for other railroads.

2000-11-12	Amtrak's Acela Express To Start Service Dec. 11	Tickets for Amtrak's new high-speed train, the Acela Express, will go on sale Nov. 29 for service between New York and Boston beginning Dec. 11. The Acela Express is to start running between New York and Washington early next year, Amtrak says, with 20 new trains replacing all long-distance trains between Boston and Washington by summer. Amtrak will still offer reserved and unreserved service using its existing fleet, but will call them Acela Regional and Acela Commuter, depending on the route, said Cecilia Cummings, an Amtrak spokeswoman. The new trains, with a suspension that lets them lean into curves for a faster and smoother ride, can travel up to 150 miles an hour, 25 miles an hour faster than the current Metroliners. They also will offer laptop computer ports and seats that slide to adjust legroom and configurations.
2000-10-22	Newark's Train to The Plane	It might look like a stranded parking garage, but the concrete wedding cake rising from the industrial plain in west Newark is expected to be the first link between the railroad lines that snake through the state and the New York area airports. While convenient rail connections are a feature of most large airports in Europe -- and many in the United States -- New York's three airports have long scorned the rails, requiring passengers to drive and park in an increasingly Byzantine series of lots.
2000-10-08	By Water or by Land, Foliage on the Hudson	Travelers in the New York area can take their pick of transportation to view the autumn landscape along the Hudson River. On Saturdays in October, the Circle Line is cruising up the Hudson River to view the fall foliage. Boarding starts at 8:30 a.m. on Pier 83 at West 42nd Street and the ferry departs at 9 a.m. There is a dock stop at Bear Mountain for a picnic lunch. Travelers may bring their own lunch or order one two days in advance for $10. The boat returns to Pier 83 at 5:30 p.m. Tickets are $40, $30 ages 12 and under and $35 for ages 65 and older.

2000-09-28	Plane or Train? The Joys and the Burdens	To the Editor: Re ''Speedier Trains'' (editorial, Sept. 21):
2000-09-27	Business Travel; The Acela Express may not be as competitive with airlines as was first thought by many.	BUSINESS travelers, still toting up the fiscal and psychological costs of the summer's air-travel gridlock, are soon going to be hearing a lot more about the future promise of ''high-speed rail.'' High-speed rail conjures up images of blazing bullet trains in Japan, or of the sleek 175-mile-an-hour and faster trains that now link cities in Europe on new rail-beds built for real speed. In this country, Congress is currently weighing passage of a bill that will enable the money-hemorrhaging Amtrak to borrow $10 billion for high-speed rail projects.
2000-09-24	R.I. Biking	To the Editor: Daisann McLane's fine story omitted one detail that could save bicycle-owning travelers money if they take Amtrak to Providence as she did. There is now one train a day that carries bicycles to that city. It's the Twilight Shoreliner, which runs between Newport News, Va., and Boston. There's a $5 service charge for taking a bike on the train, and if passengers don't have boxes, they must buy them from Amtrak for $7 each. Passengers should have the tools needed for turning the handlebars on the bike and for removing the pedals so that they fit into the boxes.
2000-09-21	Speedier Trains	On days when gridlock paralyzed Newark International Airport this year, Continental Airlines resorted to putting some of its short-flight passengers on Amtrak trains. Such pragmatic improvisation made sense, but also raises the question why anyone would choose to fly from Newark to Baltimore or Providence in the first place. At a time when the nation's air traffic system is strained to its very limits, it is a question gaining added urgency. Congress could enhance Amtrak's ability to ease the burden on the nation's congested skies and highways by passing the High Speed Rail Investment Act before it adjourns next month. The bill would enable Amtrak to issue $10 billion in bonds over the next decade for capital expenditures in designated high-speed rail corridors. States would provide some matching funds and bondholders would be paid in tax credits, at a cost to taxpayers of $3.3 billion over 10 years.
2000-08-27	Amtrak's Delays	To the Editor: Contrary to the impression that obtaining a certificate for an unsatisfactory trip on Amtrak is relatively simple, requiring 15 days or less (''Amtrak's New Approach Comes With Guarantees,'' July 30), my recent experience has indicated that it is not only tedious but almost impossible. After a particularly difficult trip from Washington to New York June 26, marked by a one-hour delay in arrival, no air-conditioning for a similar period and outright dissembling about the delay while two other Amtrak trains were available to reach New York earlier, I wrote on July 2 detailing our problems. There was no response, nor was there any to a follow-up letter on July 24.
2000-08-27	Auto Train Hoping To Quicken Delivery	The Amtrak Auto Train, which carries automobiles and passengers between the Washington area and the Orlando area, has opened a new station at its northern terminal, in Lorton, Va. Its platform is now long enough to accommodate the entire train rather than half, which was the case previously, and is expected to reduce the time needed by Auto Train staff to unload vehicles. New waiting areas with 450 seats, food service and bigger restrooms are also part of the building. The Auto Train operates once a day in each direction, leaving Lorton and Sanford, Fla., at 4 p.m. and arriving at 8:30 a.m. the next day. Lorton is 25 miles south of the capital; Sanford is on the outskirts of Orlando. Each train can handle about 270 vehicles and has 16 cars for passengers, including three dining cars. The fare for the 855-mile trip includes a dinner and Continental breakfast; sleeping car berths cost extra.
2000-08-27	Home Was a Tunnel and Neighbors Were His Cast	ONE October evening in 1994, a scruffy pod of homeless people sitting around a fire in the dank, dark Amtrak tunnel they lived in beneath Manhattan heard a thin, animated man named Ralph come up with an idea. ''Someone should be making a film about this stuff,'' he said. The others nodded or laughed or agreed or shook their heads at the absurdity of the thought, and the conversation moved on. Marc Singer still finds it hard to believe that such an idle remark could have inspired his odyssey, one that led a 20-year-old who had never picked up a camera to live underground himself, enlist his fellow outcasts as his crew and put together an 84-minute, black-and-white documentary that won three awards at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
2000-08-20	Back-to-School Travel Deals	ON a standing-room-only Amtrak train from New England to New York, I recently found myself nose to chest with a fellow passenger wearing a Hosteling International card on a lanyard around his neck. The lavaliere reminded me that youth migrations are upon us, as students flock back to college. Like senior citizens, students are a group that transportation companies want to attract, hoping that they will fill seats at times that business travelers do not: Saturdays, for example, or Tuesday mornings. AirTran, a discount airline with a hip conversational Web page for youth standby travel, www.airtran.com/deals, delineates the week with its Best Days to Fly Standby chart. Its message:
2000-08-10	Amtrak Gains Riders in July And Expects Record Year	Amtrak's ridership hit a 10-year high in July, and the number of passengers for the year is poised to set a record, railroad officials said today, crediting extensive investments to improve reliability and service. But the road toward profitability is still rocky. While ticket sales are strong, the gains in ticket revenues so far this year make up only about half of the money lost because of delays in introducing the high-speed Acela service, now about a year behind schedule.
2000-07-30	Amtrak's New Approach Comes With a Guarantee	TRAIN late? Service staff rude or unhelpful? Cafe car out of food? Amtrak says it wants to make things right, and, if it fails, wants to make sure passengers get their money's worth, by giving them a certificate for future travel. Under a new policy announced this month, passengers -- whom the railroad now refers to as ''guests'' -- are asked to make their complaint on the spot, to a conductor or other Amtrak employee. But even if a disgruntled passenger feels shortchanged and calls the national reservation number instead, the railroad will offer a certificate to take the trip again free, said George Warrington, the president.
2000-07-18	Amtrak Places Account in Review	Amtrak said yesterday that it had placed its corporate account in review. Billings were estimated at $35 million. Bill Schulz, a spokesman for Amtrak in Washington, confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek. The account had been divided among the New York office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, for creative and media duties on assignments like the new Acela trains; the E. James White Company in Herndon, Va., for promotional duties; and the Chicago office of Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, for the Amtrak Intercity trains. Lowe Lintas Chicago closed in March.
2000-07-07	Amtrak's New Tack: Free Trips for Complaints	Amtrak said today that it would offer every dissatisfied customer a free repeat trip, even if the problem was not its fault. The program is part of a campaign to build ridership and revenue by reducing the number of disgruntled passengers before Congress ends operating subsidies in 2003.
2000-07-02	Another Delay For Amtrak's Acela	Amtrak suffered another setback last month in getting its high-speed equipment into service between Washington and Boston. Officials believe the earliest possible starting date for the Acela Express is now late August. The new delay, from a hoped-for late July start, came when bolts broke on the trucks of new electric locomotives after 40,000 miles of testing. Rick Remington, an Amtrak spokesman, said that the locomotive manufacturer, Bombardier of Montreal, had not told the company how long the bolt replacement and testing would take. He said engineers, after a rough ride, found that one bolt was broken and one missing. All the locomotives were then inspected.
2000-06-29	Train Hits and Kills Boy	A young boy was hit and killed by an Amtrak train yesterday evening on an elevated section of tracks along the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the authorities said. The boy, who the police said was 11 or 12, was hit about 7:40 p.m. near 135th Street and 12th Avenue, an industrial area that is a popular spot for graffiti writers. There were spray cans found near the body, the police said.
2000-06-26	When All the World's a Phone Booth	To the Editor: Thank you for Joe Sharkey's column (Business Travel, June 21) about public cell phone use. At least, thus far, airplane passengers are subjected to this particular form of rudeness only while the plane is waiting to leave. On Amtrak, public cell phone use has turned what was once a relaxing way to travel into a nerve-jangling experience. It is outrageous to pay a hefty price for a seat on a train only to be intruded upon by a cacophony of self-centered, semi-conversations.
2000-06-18	Frozen Switches	To the Editor: I was pleased to see that Amtrak is installing modern safety devices in ''Faster Amtrak Trains, Fancier Safeguards'' by Matthew L. Wald (May 21).
2000-05-21	Faster Amtrak Trains, Fancier Safeguards	THE top speed of Amtrak trains running between here and Boston will soon rise to 150 miles an hour, up from 125 m.p.h. now between Washington and New York, and 110 m.p.h. from New York to Boston. The change will create a phenomenon that makes some people uneasy: trains whizzing over grade-level crossings at up to 85 miles an hour, a speed at which it takes about a mile to stop. But the railroad, at the behest of the federal government, is installing new computerized safety equipment, on the trains and on the tracks, that officials say will reduce the chance of accidents.
2000-04-23	The Wrong Side Of the Tracks	Historically, long-distance rail passengers have received preferential treatment, whether they were pampered on the Orient Express or the City of New Orleans. And now -- please step to the side, New Jersey Transit passengers -- riders of Amtrak's Metroliner can wait in a sprawling and sleek new area at Pennsylvania Station. Oddly, New Jersey Transit riders -- of whom there are many more coming and going from the station every day -- have been relegated to a much smaller waiting area on the first level of the station below Madison Square Garden near Eighth Avenue oin Manhattan.
2000-04-22	Student Caught in Lie Is Killed by Amtrak Train	A student who was suspended this year by Columbia University after he repeatedly lied to a professor to gain more time for an assignment was struck and killed Thursday night by an Amtrak train as he walked on the tracks near Iselin, N.J., said a lawyer for the student's family. Karen Dunn, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said the student, Puneet Bhandari, 21, made no effort to move out of the way of an approaching Metroliner train and was struck near the Metropark station, even though a train engineer ''blew the whistle numerous times.'' The Bhandari family declined to comment on Mr. Bhandari's death.
2000-03-12	Train or Plane	To the Editor: The Practical Traveler column ''Train or Plane to Boston'' (Feb. 20) was a good idea. But I continue to be baffled by Amtrak's lack of marketing foresight. The US Airways and Delta shuttles are profit leaders because of tremendous demand. Amtrak still tries to sell tickets of convenience by offering trains that stop four or five times between Washington and New York.
2000-03-05	Train or Plane	To the Editor: I read the Practical Traveler column ''Train or Plane to Boston?'' (Feb. 20) after one of my weekly Amtrak rides. As noted in the article, there is no longer the layover in New Haven, where I get on and off twice a week for my trip to Philadelphia from Hamden, Conn. It leaves me less room for error in catching the train, but the new trains are much more comfortable. The seats feel plush and the lighting is at least 10 times better. This is important because I spend seven to eight hours a week in my ''mobile office.'' With space, my laptop and my cell phone, I can accomplish a lot as I travel to Philadelphia. If I flew, the ticket would be a lot more and it would be nearly impossible to get any work done. FRANK GASPARRO Hamden, Conn.
2000-02-28	Amtrak to Expand Service, Copying Strategy of Airlines	After years of trying to balance its books by cutting service, Amtrak has concluded that to succeed it should instead create routes, offer more frequent service on existing lines and organize itself more like the airlines, so people can change trains and get to places more efficiently. Railroad officials say the railroad plans to announce on Tuesday that it will run a train from New York to California, which it believes is unprecedented. It also plans to expand service to Monterrey, Mexico, and Toronto, and stretch its Florida-to-New York service to Boston. It will add a third daily train between New York and Chicago, in hopes that if it gives travelers more schedule choices, more people will choose trains over cars or planes. And it hopes to attract business travelers on routes like Washington to Atlanta on overnight trains.
2000-02-20	The Way We Live Now: 2-20-00: Expert Opinion; Uniform of The Day	As three highly visible companies -- McDonald's; Amtrak, with its new Acela train; and the new JetBlue airline -- unveil their new uniforms, the line between work clothes and fashion is becoming significantly harder to draw. All three outfits are the work of Stan Herman, who has been designing uniforms since the 1970's. And all three reflect new thinking about the way work attire influences a company's image and its employees' performance. Many of the elements of these uniforms are specifically conceived to address the sartorial needs of their users; others come straight off the runway. ''All those marvelous minimal clothes -- they used a lot of the elements of uniforms,'' Herman says. Below, he explains the evolution of employee chic in three case studies. Melanie Rehak McDonald's ''McDonald's is very fixated on designers like Hilfiger or Polo. These people have to look friendly and hip, so when I walk in there I'm not cut off. They're not wearing ties. And we're talking about the younger work force, 16 to 24, so I want them to think: 'Gee I like that. I'd even wear it out.' I wanted the colors to be easy, but I wanted that gold stripe to represent those old golden arches. So we've gone back to deep colors -- the greens, the navys, the reds. The crew gets three colors of polo shirt, black pants. (They're behind the counter, so sometimes they don't think the pants matter that much, but that's changing.) The seminal piece is the 'shirt jack.' It makes it possible for the person wearing it to wear the shirt out. That's a very big thing that's happening with young people today. We think it looks neat as opposed to a shirttail. Everything has to be washable, washable, washable. These kids work hard and get sweaty, and the uniform has to look good, so color-fastness has to come into consideration. You also have to think of the price of the shirt. For JetBlue you're talking about an $80 or $100 shirt, and McDonald's is $12, $8. But you can't touch the M. If a company has tradition, you can't step on it.'' Amtrak Acela ''They had a bad history for uniforms at Amtrak. But they're coming out with new management and a new train, and they felt that clothing was one area that they really wanted to give as a gift to their people. You're talking about a broad spectrum of people, some of whose fathers and grandfathers worked on those trains. So we had a lot of focus groups. The pants fit, the shirts were too sheer -- we decided to give them a top-notch shirt in fabric they were proud of. The big decision was to take them out of navy into blue-gray with an accent of Acela blue. The conductor's jacket is basically the traditional shape, with the 10 pockets they expect. We worked on an outside pocket flap that gave it a new, very modern detail. Then on top of it, I gave them a bag, so they don't even have to use the pockets. Some of the men think it's feminine. It's the most fashion-forward thing we did. For the shirt we used Tencel, the new miracle natural fiber. For the pants, they have the option of pleats or no pleats. I like the no pleats, and I'm trying to get them into it. And look at this hat! It's reshaped, so it really looks good on everyone. The overall look of this is modern traditional. We showed this uniform to some guys in Providence and it was like a love-in. I couldn't believe it.'' JetBlue ''JetBlue is a very fresh, explosive New York airline. They said, 'Even if some people don't understand it, we want to look different from anybody else.' They're a start-up. They wanted to look severely potent. They wanted it to be in black. But they named their airline JetBlue, so I said, 'We'll find a way to make navy look distinctive.' The most important thing for me is that when they walk up and down the aisle they have a distinct attitude. And I wanted them all one color, because I think that when you get older, being broken at the midriff just isn't the best scenario. Then the idea came to me: what if I don't give them jackets? It's like eliminating the suit from the banker. So this incredible shirt became the core of the uniform. And we've taken off the stripes, we've taken off the bells and whistles that are normally associated with airlines, so they look like regular clothes. The woman's shirt could also be worn at a party. And they don't have an apron, because they're not going to be servants. The pants have the shape of flat-front trousers, but they have pleats. (It's my compromise to the age group.) The ramp guys have bomber jackets and cargo pants. We gave the flight crew these little sort of Prada pouches. When people put it all on they say, 'Oh, my God, these are all clothes I would buy.' But when you put them all together, they're a ready-to-wear approach to uniform.''
2000-02-17	Subsidies Aplenty	To the Editor: The article on Amtrak's new Acela train (''The High-Speed Train That Thought It Could, but Couldn't,'' Feb. 3) left an important part of the story untold.
2000-02-10	No Phone Calls, Please	To the Editor: Phil Patton writes that the ability to use cell phones anywhere on a high-speed train trip is a benefit (''The High-Speed Train That Thought It Could, but Can't,'' Feb. 3). He then quotes an Amtrak official who says that passengers ''view the journey as a space, an element of time that becomes their own.''
2000-02-04	A Five-Hour Train Ride Dedicated to Schmoozing	As the Schmooze Express rolled down the New Jersey rails toward the nation's capital today, the biggest attention getters were not the half-dozen candidates for the United States Senate aboard, or even the three Men Who Would Be Governor, but the most creative giveaways. There was the foam-rubber locomotive that went ''choo-choo'' when you squeezed it, and the Jim McGreevey Energy Pack, handed out by the perpetually campaigning Mayor of Woodbridge. (''Main ingredients: hard work and determination.'')
2000-02-03	The High-Speed Train That Thought It Could, but Can't	INSPIRATION for the new logo for Amtrak's Acela train began, strangely, with a turtle. ''A turtle doesn't move very fast,'' admitted Nick Oakley, one of the designers of the new high-speed train. But during brainstorming sessions, designers kept coming back to the image of a sea turtle making stately and peaceful progress through blue waters as the key to the mood they wanted to suggest. The result was an abstracted fin.
2000-02-01	With Fanfare and a Delay, Amtrak Unveils a Faster Train	Amtrak unveiled new fully electrified train service between Boston and New York yesterday, but the day was marred by technical problems that seemed symbolic of the difficulties the company has faced in a $2.6 billion high-speed rail venture. The improved service was the first step in a project to introduce 150-mile-an-hour trains that would reduce travel time to Boston to three hours from five and cut about 15 minutes off travel time to Washington. But yesterday, as Amtrak officials boasted about the superiority of the service, called Acela (pronounced ah-SELL-ah), mechanical problems delayed the first train.
2000-01-29	Broken Power Line Paralyzes Penn Station	A downed power line inside Pennsylvania Station delayed Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains for more than an hour at the height of yesterday evening's rush hour, an Amtrak spokesman said. The power line, weakened by winter weather, broke about 5 p.m. on the eastern side of the station, the spokesman said. Electricity was restored to the entire system about 45 minutes later. The loss of power, which spread to the Sunnyside yard in Queens and south to Princeton Junction, N.J., caused delays of up to an hour and 20 minutes.
1999-12-21	Officials Call Penn Station Fire an Accident, Not Arson	A smoky fire that shut down Pennsylvania Station on Sunday afternoon was accidental, rather than arson as first suspected, and could cause some rush-hour delays on Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit trains for several days, officials said yesterday. The two-alarm fire in a track-switching shanty beneath the station stranded thousands of holiday shoppers on one of the busiest Sundays of the year, and forced more rail delays yesterday, with more than half of the morning trains running behind schedule.
1999-12-20	Penn Station Fire Delays Thousands and Sends Chaos Down Line	Tens of thousands of holiday shoppers and travelers were stranded or delayed yesterday afternoon when a fire in a signal box shut Pennsylvania Station for more than four hours on the busiest Sunday of the year, the authorities said. The fire, which the authorities called suspicious, led officials to cancel more than 100 trains on Amtrak, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit, spreading waves of rail-related chaos up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Officials at Amtrak and the L.I.R.R. predicted delays on this morning's commute because the fire destroyed the automated signaling system that directs traffic in much of Penn Station, the nation's busiest rail terminal.
1999-12-19	When a Child Travels Alone	NO matter how self-assured children seem, when they are traveling alone there is always a moment when the plane begins to empty or the train pulls out that their vulnerability shows. In a perfect world, children would not travel alone until they were skilled, ready and pressing for the chance. But the world is not perfect, and this holiday season tens of thousands of children will be heading home from school, or from one parent to the other, or from grandparents to parents, sometimes even from country to country.
1999-12-19	Trying to Urge People to Take the Train	IT takes the average commuter about 45 to 50 minutes to get from Guilford to New Haven on Interstate 95 in rush-hour traffic. When construction to widen the I-95 corridor and the Quinnipiac River Bridge begins in October 2001, the ride may be a whole lot longer. State Senator William A. Aniskovich, a Republican and a ranking member of the joint committee on transportation, predicts that commuters will spend an additional 30 minutes sitting in traffic on their way to work. He is trying hard to convince shoreline residents to get out of their cars and on to the train. Although the state has agreed to put another train on the tracks four months before construction, it has said no to Mr. Aniskovich's plan to offer free train service as a way of getting people to try public transportation.
1999-11-21	Amtrak and Hertz Expand Rental Sites	Amtrak and the Hertz Corporation are expanding efforts to help railroad passengers rent cars on arrival, just as air passengers can at the airport. Since May, Hertz has established a presence in 18 railroad stations, mostly in the West, though sometimes it is only a dedicated wall phone. At the end of October, the two organizations announced that they would put rail-drive links into 20 more depots. One will be Pennsylvania Station in New York, where starting in December, there will be a wall phone; from there, passengers will walk about a block to 250 West 34th Street to pick up cars.
1999-10-17	Amtrak Changes	To the Editor: In the Aug. 29 Travel Advisory, I was astonished to read that Amtrak promises that its new program of customer service will involve ''checking each train before departure for adequate food supplies and properly functioning plumbing.''
1999-09-02	New Amtrak Train Delayed Because of Wear on Wheels	Amtrak's new 150-mile-an-hour express train, which was supposed to start service between Washington and Boston this year, will be several months late because the wheels on the passenger coaches vibrate at high speeds and are wearing out too quickly, the railroad and the builders said today. Amtrak is counting on the new service, called Acela (pronounced ah-SELL-ah), to lure business away from the airlines and generate $180 million a year in profits. Those profits will help the railroad meet a cut-off in operating subsidies at the end of the 2002 fiscal year.
1999-08-29	Amtrak Is Rolling Out Satisfaction Express	Amtrak plans to put a customer-satisfaction guarantee into effect by the end of the year. Passengers dissatisfied with the service, food or other aspects of their trip will be able to get a voucher with a value equal to the trip's cost. The guarantee will take effect after the company completes a training program for its 24,000 employees, establishes standards for its service and creates employee incentives. It is similar to programs at many hotel chains, and its announcement last month came at the peak of a dispute in Congress over airline passengers' rights.
1999-08-04	Back to Amtrak Basics	To the Editor: Re ''Amtrak Tests New High-Speed Train in Desert for Northeast Run'' (news article, Aug. 2): Instead of worrying about luxury transport for elite customers, Amtrak's standard maintenance and service must be upgraded to prevent frequent delays. On Sunday, the Amtrak train I was on from Boston to New York was delayed more than six hours because of a ''signal problem'' and a ''broken engine.'' The public address system malfunctioned, so passengers were often kept in the dark in more ways than one. Given the congestion on our highways and the pollution it produces, Federal investment in reliable mass transit is vital. Amtrak needs to go back to basics. ANDY HUMM New York, Aug. 2, 1999
1999-08-02	Amtrak Tests New High-Speed Train in Desert for Northeast Run	Amtrak's first new train in a generation, the fastest on the continent, is scheduled to be zipping passengers past crowded streets, highways and runways from Washington to Boston by the end of the year. But its first trials are being held here on a desert track that runs amid the cholla cactus and the rattlesnakes. Tests are going well, engineers say, but there are still technical questions to work out. Not to mention what happened to the antelope.
1999-06-30	High Speed Plus Luxury On the Rails	Amtrak unveiled its hope for the future today, the continent's fastest train, which is to begin running late this year from here to New York and Boston. The railroad is hoping to create a nationwide demand for reliable, fast and luxurious trains among travelers who will pay a hefty ticket price to avoid driving or flying. The train, the Acela Express (pronounced ah-SELL-ah), is expected to run from New York to Boston in 3 hours 8 minutes, down from 4 hours 47 minutes, giving Amtrak its first real crack at the business-travel market between those cities. The railroad plans to double the number of daily seats between those cities, to 8,000, and almost double the number of trains, to 34 from 18, adding its first ''premium'' trains to the route.
1999-06-16	Business Travel; If you're going where the tracks go, the train can be a realistic, pleasant alternative to air travel.	OF course, the train doesn't have anywhere near the reach of the plane. But for business travelers who happen to be headed where the train tracks go, the railroad offers a realistic alternative to the dread airport departure lounge. Here's a report on one recent business trip on Amtrak's Metroliner, which travels between New York City and Washington, D.C.:
1999-06-11	Waiting for a Final Resting Place; Friends Seek Proper Burial for a Former Tunnel Dweller	For 13 years, Jose Camacho lived in the cavernous dark of an abandoned Amtrak railroad tunnel under Riverside Park, part of a subterranean clan of homeless people who scavenged their existence from the city's leavings. He died last month at 54 in a sunny one-bedroom in the Bronx that he finally secured in 1996 through the kindness of strangers and a rare Government subsidy. Now, death has made Mr. Camacho homeless again. Unless his decomposed body can be officially identified and money raised for a funeral, a city morgue will send him to a potter's field on Hart Island for an anonymous burial.
1999-06-04	An offbeat campaign for Amtrak introduces a new rail service.	THERE'S the midnight train to Georgia and the last train to Clarksville, the A train and the soul train, not to mention the Chattanooga Choo-Choo and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe. Now an unconventional campaign seeks to add another name to the list of familiar rail monikers: Acela. Acela, pronounced ''a-CELL-a,'' is the brand to be introduced by Amtrak later this year to designate service in the Northeast corridor, its most heavily traveled route, replacing the Metroliner and other trains. There is a lot, well, riding on the fate of Acela, because Amtrak is counting on the new service to help improve its financial performance and end its dependence on Federal operating subsidies by 2002, as required by law.
1999-06-01	500 Mourn Mother and Sons Killed by Train	Julia Toledo de Urgiles lay in her coffin with her youngest son, Pedro Andres, 3. Two other sons, Jose Francisco, 10, and Angel Gabriel, 6, shared one, too. Carlos Enrique, 11, had his own. On top was a white T-shirt he had won from a drug abuse prevention program, but had not had a chance to collect before his sudden death. The three gleaming white coffins were placed side by side, the two that held the remains of Jose, Angel and Carlos adorned with the black and red scribblings of friends and relatives in English and Spanish: ''We will miss you,'' ''We love you,'' ''We will always remember you.''
1999-05-29	Father Arrives to Claim Train Victims' Bodies	A man whose family was struck and killed by an Amtrak train earlier this week arrived in New York from Ecuador last night and said that he intended to take the bodies of his wife and their four sons back home. Wearing a frayed suit and looking bewildered, the man, Carlos Urgiles, a farmhand from a rural Andean town, said he planned to give his family a Catholic burial in their native country, perhaps as early as Monday.
1999-05-27	Surviving Boy Was Misidentified in Amtrak Deaths	The police and railroad officials, continuing their investigation into the death of a 48-year-old woman and three of her four sons who were on the railroad tracks early Tuesday when they were struck by an Amtrak train, said today that the wrong boy was identified as the sole survivor of the accident. Facing a roomful of reporters and television cameras at the Fairfield Police Department on Tuesday, Metropolitan Transit Authority Police officials said that family members had identified the surviving boy as Angel Gabriel Urgiles Toledo, 6.
1999-05-26	Woman and 3 of Her Children Are Killed by an Amtrak Train	A woman and three of her four young sons were killed early this morning when they were hit by an Amtrak train as the woman crossed the tracks in a last-second attempt to rescue one of the children from the locomotive's path, the State Police said. One of the four boys who was struck survived, but remained unconscious and was in gravely critical condition at Bridgeport Hospital tonight after surgery to repair a deep head wound and several bone fractures, hospital officials said. The boy, whom the police identified as Angel Gabriel Urgiles Toledo, 6, also underwent emergency surgery to amputate what remained of his left leg, which had been severed when the train rolled over him at 2:20 A.M.
1999-05-16	Shift in Train Schedule Leaves Out Mystic	THE Amtrak spring schedule that takes effect today temporarily eliminates a midday train that has been carrying tourists from New York to Mystic for seven days a week. The train, which leaves Manhattan at 10:30 A.M. and picks up passengers in Connecticut, is the only train that brought people to Mystic Aquarium and Mystic Seaport, two of the state's top tourist attractions, at a prime time of the day. The train had arrived at 1:30 P.M. The other two trains that serve Mystic arrive at 4:18 A.M. and 10:14 P.M.
1999-04-30	One of baseball's most colorful figures finds he is in demand again.	SOME 35 years after he stopped playing ball, Yogi Berra is having something of a renaissance as a pitchman. For the former Yankee catcher, it really is deja vu all over again. Right now, you can see him in television spots promoting Amtrak and tourism in New Jersey, and in new print ads for the nonprofit Yogi Berra Museum at Montclair State University in Little Falls, N.J. He is also scheduled to appear in May in a funny television commercial for Nike about baseball. Locally, Mr. Berra is appearing in spots for Hilltop Nissan, a New Jersey dealer.
1999-04-18	Letting Litter Lie Is No Way to Run a Railroad, Locals Say	In this quiet neighborhood of single-family homes, the streets are marked by well-manicured lawns and colorful flower beds. That is, except Sacket Avenue. The street runs next to the fenced-in Amtrak railroad tracks, and the grassy area between the tracks and the street is overgrown and littered with garbage from fast-food restaurants and household items. Residents of the Morris Park area say the debris is both an eyesore and a reminder that Amtrak has not been a good neighbor.
1999-04-04	High-Speed Amtrak Begins to Roll, Slowly	WHEN Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, ended state financing in January for the proposed 320-mile high-speed rail project that would have linked Miami, Orlando and Tampa, the future of high-speed train service in the United States suffered an apparent major setback. But an unlikely savior -- make that an unlikely possible savior -- rode toward the rescue earlier this month: Amtrak, that much maligned national passenger rail system created by Congress in 1971, which has lost money every year since.
1999-03-20	Preventing Railroad Tragedies	To the Editor: With the law of inertia alive and well, ''The Carnage at Bourbonnais'' (editorial, March 18) might have been less if passengers traveling on Amtrak trains had the option of wearing seat belts.
1999-03-20	Witness's Story Shifts With Language, Crash Investigators Say	As they wound down their investigation at the scene of Monday's deadly crash of an Amtrak train and a truck loaded with steel, Federal investigators said today that a language barrier might have caused them to misunderstand the description of the accident by their first witness. They now understand the witness to have said that he did not see the truck drive around a crossing gate before it was struck by the train. On Thursday, Federal investigators told reporters that the witness had said he had seen the truck zig-zag around the gates, but today the investigators said the witness was saying that he did not see the truck go around the gate.
1999-03-19	Motorist Asserts Trucker Tried To Pass Gates Before Crash	A possible witness has come forward in the deadly crash of an Amtrak train and a truck on Monday night in Bourbonnais, Ill., and a Federal official said tonight that the man said he saw the truck driver try to snake through the lowered crossing gates. The man called Amtrak on Wednesday, saying he was driving a car behind the truck. National Transportation Safety Board officials said they were transcribing into English tapes of an interview with the motorist, a Spanish-speaking Chicago man, and would not give a full account of what he said.
1999-03-18	Crash Inquiry Focuses on Tire Tracks	Federal safety investigators today began trying to identify the source of a set of tire tracks inside the crossing gate at the site of a deadly crash of an Amtrak train and a semi-trailer truck on Monday night in Bourbonnais, Ill. The tracks ''would indicate somebody tried to go around the gates,'' said John Goglia, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.
1999-03-18	Seeking Solace in Deep Faith and Prayer	No one here ever truly understood how June Bonnin managed to stay alive, holding cancer at bay, refusing all treatment and relying on prayer to consume her tumors and growths. But she did survive, building a splendid white inn here with the extra years granted to her, and the delight she took in beating the odds magnified the impact for her friends of her apparent death on Monday on the Amtrak train that crashed in Illinois. Mrs. Bonnin, 46, along with her 11-year-old granddaughter, Jessica Whitaker, and two young girls from this same rural suburb of Memphis, Rainey Lipscomb, 10, and her sister Lacey, 8, were aboard the sleeper car that took the brunt in the wreck, which is believed to have killed them and seven others. They had gone to Chicago, with four other family members, for a long weekend, touring the aquarium and the Children's Museum. The girls were particularly thrilled to have visited a store that sells American Girls historical dolls, their favorites.
1999-03-18	The Carnage at Bourbonnais	Tragedies like Monday night's collision of an Amtrak passenger train and a truck in Bourbonnais, Ill., south of Chicago, often appear to be freak accidents that would be difficult to prevent. But adopting that attitude toward the collision that took at least 11 lives and injured more than 100 people would be shortsighted. Even if human error -- possible reckless driving around warning gates by a truck driver with a problematic driving record -- turns out to be a cause of the collision, there are steps that can be taken to lessen the risks at the nation's more than 260,000 grade-level rail crossings. Curbing fatalities is going to require local, state and Federal officials to accelerate the use of engineering solutions, law enforcement and public education. The number of fatalities caused by train-vehicle collisions has been dropping in recent years, but deaths at rail crossings still totaled 422 last year. It would not be hard to reduce the carnage. Municipal, county and state officials have long had priority lists for making safety improvements at rail crossings. The problem is usually money. The best solution, bridges or tunnels that put vehicles and trains at different levels, is the most costly.
1999-03-17	13 Are Killed as Amtrak Train Collides With Truck in Illinois	They were just settling in for the night, comfortably ensconced in the first-class double-decker sleeper car of a train with a famous name, The City of New Orleans. They had boarded in Chicago, just two hours before, and their train, its legend celebrated in a popular American folk song, was due to pull into New Orleans in the late afternoon of the next day. But in a single horrifying instant, everything changed. At 9:47 P.M. Monday, Amtrak's City of New Orleans smashed into a semi-trailer truck at a railroad crossing in this rural town about 55 miles south of Chicago.
1999-03-17	No Whistle, But Sirens And Flames	The passenger train had just swept across the snowy farm fields, passing a tall white grain elevator, and was headed, a bit late, for its stop in Kankakee, an old railroad town where the whistle echoes like a lullaby every night. ''The whistle, the clanging, it's a good noise,'' said Dennis Brady, 57, who lives in Kankakee, ''a noise that's supposed to be there.''
1999-03-17	Government Says Crash Site Had a Computerized Warning System	The Federal Government says it has been working hard since 1991 to reduce the chance of train-vehicle collisions like the one on Monday in Bourbonnais, Ill., but the railroad crossing there was one the Government said had already been fixed. ''It had the best we've got,'' said Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.
1999-03-16	Amtrack Train Derails in Crash Near Chicago, Injuring Dozens	The Amtrak passenger train City of New Orleans derailed last night in a heap of rail cars after striking a truck loaded with steel beams near Kankakee, Ill., Amtrak officials said. At least 47 of the more than 200 passengers were injured, some critically, officials at two hospitals said. No fatalities were reported by midnight, but the hospital officials said they expected more injured to arrive.
1999-03-12	Amtrak's Fast Train to Boston Isn't for the Frugal	To the Editor: Officials describe the proposed fare on Amtrak's new high-speed rail service between Boston and New York City as about 30 percent less than the fare for airline shuttle service between the cities (''Amtrak Unveils Its Bullet to Boston,'' news article, March 10).
1999-03-10	Amtrak Unveils Its Bullet to Boston	Aiming to bring high-speed rail service to Boston by the start of the new millennium, Amtrak said yesterday that it would start rolling out the first of its new 150 mile-an-hour trains by December. The new high-speed rail line intends to change commuting habits along the Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston by competing head on with air shuttles and interstate highways. But more important for Amtrak, the high-speed train provides a model for its rail service across the nation, and is the centerpiece of its hopes of economic redemption after operating for three decades with government subsidies.
1999-01-31	Riding Amtrak	To the Editor: My husband and I are college professors and we take long-distance Amtrak trains at least five times a year. The article referred to one dissatisfied couple and not to the countless others who are happy. Never once have we been bumped from a train because Amtrak overbooked nor has Amtrak ever lost our luggage. Amtrak food far surpasses the ''cuisine'' offered by airlines. We have never encountered a hostile employee on the phone. Tickets have been mailed to us within three or four days of a phone reservation.
1999-01-31	Riding Amtrak	To the Editor: About the article ''On Amtrak, Full Speed Ahead'' by Betsy Wade (Dec. 13): As a Thanksgiving (Wednesday and Sunday) traveler on Amtrak from Springfield, Mass., to Washington, I was not impressed. The trip from Springfield to New Haven used uncomfortable commuter cars and the service required a change of trains in New Haven. I managed to get a seat, but the train broke down for two hours near Bridgeport. We had to spend almost an hour in Philadelphia loading mail.

Rail Sale tickets are not available through travel agents or Amtrak reservation agents, but only by credit card at reservations .amtrak.com. Tickets can be delivered by mail or picked up at an Amtrak station. The Rail Sale Web site is updated periodically for tickets discounted from 40 to 90 percent off the lowest regular fare.
1999-01-21	Amtrak, Fighting Red Ink, Adds a Variety of Freight Business	Amtrak said today that to balance its books before Congress eliminates its operating subsidies, it would haul fruits and vegetables cross-country, United Parcel Service packages across the Southwest, express packages on Metroliners between New York and Washington, and more U.S. mail all over the nation. The company, formally the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, said it hoped for a huge expansion of nonpassenger business and had also rented out space for fiber-optic lines on its Washington-to-Boston corridor for $75 million.
1999-01-15	Train Passengers Fall Hostage to Elements	Yesterday's weather, if nothing else, provided some interesting lessons in mass transit logistics. Amtrak's Train No. 48 was supposed to leave Chicago and head to New York City at 7:30 P.M. Wednesday. Because of the weather, however, it did not leave until 1:35 A.M. yesterday. The snow and sleet continued to fall, but Train No. 48 soldiered on across the Midwest.
1998-12-13	On Amtrak, Full Speed Ahead	AMTRAK is pleased with itself this fall. It considered Thanksgiving week, usually its heaviest travel period of the year, a success, apparently with a record rider total -- the figures were still being added last week. And on the Monday after the holiday weekend, it dedicated two more of its fancy new trains in the Pacific Northwest. Just before that, it reported that its passenger total increased by a million in the year that ended in September, a rise of 4.5 percent, the biggest jump in a decade. Revenues also topped $1 billion for the first time since Congress created Amtrak 27 years ago. What's going on?
1998-11-08	. . . And There's That Lilt at Penn Station	''I sometimes imagine the passengers go home with a smile on their face, thinking that there's some nice young Irish thing doing the announcements,'' said Margaret McGowan, with a hearty laugh. ''Now they're going to find out it's an old Irish bat, and they're going to want to get off the train!'' The 60-year-old Ms. McGowan, a native of Dublin, is one of a handful of announcers who work at Amtrak's customer service station at Track 15 in Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, alerting passengers to the arrivals, departures and delays of trains for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit.
1998-10-04	Autumn Leaves, Seen From a Train	With the countryside wearing its fall colors, Amtrak offers several scenic train trips in the Eastern United States. Here are a few examples. In the Northeast, the Adirondack journeys up the Hudson River every day on its trip from New York to Albany, and then travels through the Adirondacks on the way to Montreal. The fare for the complete trip from New York to Montreal, which takes nine and a half hours, starts at $49 each way.
1998-09-30	Amtrak Unveils $185 Million Plan for Faster Service Upstate	Amtrak officials and Gov. George E. Pataki announced a five-year plan yesterday to upgrade the tracks between New York City and Albany and rebuild trains used on the route to shave at least 20 minutes off the trip, allowing riders to cover the distance in less than two hours. When the work on the $185 million program is completed, trains that now rarely exceed 90 miles per hour will cruise at 125 m.p.h. The plan also includes building a second track between Albany and Schenectady and an upgrade of the track between Albany and Buffalo, cutting as much as an hour off a trip from New York City and Buffalo, which now takes more than seven and a half hours.
1998-09-13	Monet, With a Mint On the Pillow in Boston	Several Boston-area hotels and Amtrak are offering packages that include passes to the exhibition ''Monet in the 20th Century,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The show will run from Sunday through Dec. 27 before traveling to the Royal Academy of Arts in London. It will include more than 80 paintings produced by Claude Monet from 1900, when he was 60, until his death at 86. Though the tickets being sold for the exhibit to the general public specify a time for entry, the passes that come with the packages may be used by visitors anytime during their stay, according to Erin Gobeil, marketing coordinator for the museum. Both groups of museumgoers may have to wait for up to a half hour to enter the exhibit.
1998-07-16	Amtrak Police Officer Indicted in Assault Case at Penn Station	An Amtrak police officer was indicted yesterday by a Federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges that he assaulted a homeless man in Pennsylvania Station in 1995, violating his civil rights. In a one-count indictment, Officer Frank Santos was charged with hitting the homeless man, Charles Wright, with a firearm on Dec. 8 of that year and causing Mr. Wright bodily injury. If convicted, Officer Santos, who is scheduled to be arraigned next Thursday, faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.
2014-01-02	A New Penn Station	Negotiators for the United States Postal Service and a city-state development agency have finally reached a tentative peace agreement that would transform part of the James A. Farley Post Office on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan into a railroad station. One big question is how much the Postal Service is willing to part with. But the news that both sides are now willing to get started is welcome. New Yorkers need and tourists deserve a new terminal on the West Side that is not only comfortable and efficient but evokes the grandeur lost when New York City foolishly dismantled the old Penn Station in 1963. The shape of the project will begin to emerge only when the Postal Service and the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation draft a memorandum of understanding that spells out exactly how much space the Postal Service will provide and what plans it has for the rest of the 1.4-million-square-foot building. But the vision of a grand new gateway to the city, long nurtured by organizations like the Municipal Arts Society and public figures like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, seems somewhat less remote than it was a few weeks ago.
1998-03-05	Deal Will Give A Grand Space To Penn Station	Thirty-five years after the old Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan was leveled, Federal officials announced an agreement yesterday to begin converting the landmark General Post Office building on Eighth Avenue into a new train station. They said work could start this summer. Officials said that in the next few months the Postal Service would begin vacating about half the ground floor of the ornate, 84-year-old structure, officially the James A. Farley Building across from Madison Square Garden, making way for a new concourse with escalators descending to Amtrak platforms directly below.
1998-03-01	A Ride Back in Time: Pullman Cars Return	The return of luxury train travel in the United States will get a boost on Saturday, with the first of four transcontinental trips by two refurbished private cars from the 1920's, one built for Harold Vanderbilt, the son of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Pulled by regular Amtrak trains, the cars, operated by American Pullman Traditions of San Marino, Calif., offer accommodations for a total of 16 passengers on this week's seven-night trip, from New York to San Francisco. Besides meals specially prepared in the cars' kitchens (including candlelight dinners), the journey offers two-night stays in Chicago and San Francisco, at the Four Seasons Hotel and the Clift Hotel, respectively, and a side trip by bus to the Clos Pegase winery in Napa Valley, where dinner will be served by candlelight. From New York to Chicago, the host train is the Lake Shore Limited, and from Chicago to San Francisco, it is the California Zephyr.
1998-01-23	Lift Fiscal Burden From Amtrak	To the Editor: Re ''As Rail Travel Declines, So Do Amtrak's Options'' (news article, Jan. 17): The problem with Amtrak lies not with its popularity, since train travel is often more convenient than driving or flying, but with the regulatory and fiscal hurdles imposed on it by Congress. Amtrak must pay millions in retirement benefits to former employees of the old railroads that it took over in 1971. The law also prohibits access to billions of Federal transportation dollars that subsidize automobile and airline travel.
1998-01-23	Lift Fiscal Burden From Amtrak	To the Editor: Your Jan. 17 news article says that ''most inter-city trains travel at less than 70 miles per hour; many travel at less than 50 m.p.h.'' But these speeds should have been labeled average. The top speeds on trains outside the Northeast are 79 to 90 miles an hour. From 1982 to 1997 ridership grew 280 percent, to 688,000 a year, on California's San Joaquin Valley line. Parts of the single-track Los Angeles-San Diego line are being doubled; Amtrak's 1997 ridership on this line totaled 1.6 million.
1998-01-18	The Early Bird Gets the Seat	THOSE who have been aboard lately know that Amtrak has been undergoing steady changes in the last five years. For one thing, unlike their cousins, the daily commuters, long-distance travelers do not find a simple chart of sample fares in the back of the timetable. The fare structure is as fluid as chicken broth except for the Northeast Corridor, between Boston and Washington. For service outside the Northeast, the line has been using the system the airlines use, that is, yield management: the fare rises and falls, sometimes daily, on the basis of anticipated demand, which is affected by day of the week, season, and factors as unpredictable as the scheduling of a demonstration in Washington. And even in the Northeast Corridor the layers of services at various prices can confound passengers: custom class is not first class but some creature halfway between coach and first.
1998-01-17	As Rail Travel Declines, So Do Amtrak's Options	With a new national debate about to begin on the future of Amtrak, the proponents of subsidies for a national, inter-city passenger rail system must wrestle with an undeniable truth: While travel by car and by plane have grown wildly since Congress voted to create Amtrak 28 years ago, the passenger train has become less and less important as a means of inter-city travel. Since that vote in 1970, the number of miles that the airlines carried passengers has more than quadrupled, to 578 billion; the number of miles that people travel in cars has risen by two-thirds, to more than 2.8 trillion.
1998-01-16	Clinton Would End Amtrak Subsidies, Senators Complain	The Clinton Administration has tentatively decided to cut off all operating subsidies for Amtrak in the next Federal budget, a move that would threaten the future of the passenger-railroad network, six Senators said today. In an angry letter, the Senators, all from the Northeast, accused President Clinton of backtracking on his pledges of support for the system. Amtrak is getting $344 million in operating subsidies in the current fiscal year and had sought $376 million in the one that begins on Oct. 1.
1997-12-24	Amtrak's Unsure Future	To the Editor: Re ''Amtrak's Survival Wager'' (editorial, Dec. 22): The main reason Amtrak is in its current condition is that it lacks dedicated finances for its long-term operation. Since it was established in 1970, Amtrak has never had a reliable source of income, operating instead on what amounts to a year-to-year shoestring budget. It's difficult to operate any business without a long-range plan; a capital-intensive passenger railroad is no exception.
1997-12-22	Amtrak's Survival Wager	Thomas Downs's abrupt retirement as chairman and chief executive of Amtrak this month is a worrisome sign that the national passenger rail system is still mired in difficulties despite a $2.3 billion rescue package recently signed into law in Washington. The turmoil suggests that Amtrak may have trouble winning the big bet it made with Congress and the Administration. Amtrak has promised that by 2002 it will cover its operating costs without a cent of Federal operating subsidy or propose a plan for orderly liquidation. With Mr. Downs out as chief executive and Amtrak soon to be run by a new board and monitored by a fiscal oversight panel, both required under a new law, it is far from clear that Amtrak can win this wager. Amtrak can be thought of as several regional businesses under one logo. Its coastal units, the Northeast Corridor and Amtrak West, show great promise because they serve areas with sufficient population density. With high-speed trains between Boston and Washington due by late 1999, the Northeast Corridor should move permanently into the black. Amtrak West has developed opportunities in the Pacific Coast corridors, and Midwestern states have identified potential corridors of their own.
1997-12-17	Business Travel; An experiment by United Airlines to further limit carry-on baggage is well received by passengers.	TWO weeks ago, UAL's United Airlines began a one-bag carry-on policy experiment for passengers in Des Moines who buy the lowest-fare tickets, and other carriers also tightened their carry-on policies. Since then, airlines say, there appears to be both more rigorous enforcement of the policies and wider compliance with them. But the true test, they add, will be determined when planes are no longer routinely jammed with passengers, and carriers and passengers alike relax their guard. While the Federal Aviation Administration has already said it does not favor regulation, business travelers are chiming in with suggestions for improvement. A recent survey of members by the National Business Travel Association found that 63 percent of respondents want carry-on luggage restrictions applied to all passengers regardless of ticket class or air fare. A survey by Yesawich, Pepperdine & Brown/Yankelovich Partners did not address the number of carry-on bags, but found that 65 percent of business travelers want more space for the baggage they do carry on.
1997-12-11	Head of Amtrak Quits After Railroad Endures a Fall of Troubles	The head of Amtrak resigned today near the end of an autumn in which the passenger-railroad network was beset by labor unrest, political battles and deep financial troubles. Thomas M. Downs, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Amtrak, said in a prepared statement that he was stepping down because ''it is time for me to move on to new challenges and, hopefully, take some time off.'' Mr. Downs said he had no immediate plans.
1997-12-04	Reaching The Slopes Without Driving	New York City drivers who brave icy roads to go skiing each weekend know the ritual as a nasty rite of passage befalling city dwellers. But now Amtrak has come up with a few alternatives for making winter excursions more palatable. Amtrak has worked out ski-train agreements this season with Hunter Mountain and Ski Windham, resorts in the Catskill Mountains. The trend gathered steam last year when Amtrak began operating the Ethan Allen Express, the first dedicated ski train and bus pickup service to Vermont resorts.
1997-11-15	High-Speed Trains, Low-Speed Lines	Amtrak has been scrambling to make good on its promise to provide rail service between New York and Boston in just three hours by the end of the decade. But because the list of vital construction projects is long and the pool of capital funds shallow, Amtrak's goal of offering swift, dependable service can easily be derailed unless Connecticut, Metro-North and Amtrak officials give high priority to a particularly antiquated section of power lines. The first phase of high-speed service is set for October 1999, almost two years away. But the disruption that thousands of Metro-North commuters encountered on Oct. 22 sends an ominous warning of the obstacles to providing reliable, high-speed competition to the air shuttles. That morning, two commuter trains pulled down a stretch of overhead power lines in Greenwich, Conn., part of an obstacle course of lines that went up early in the century and still extend for 46.7 miles between the New York State line and New Haven.
1997-11-14	Compromise in Congress Saves Amtrak but Eliminates Its Board	Amtrak will apparently survive its latest fiscal crisis under a compromise reached in the closing hours of the House and Senate sessions for the year. But the railroad's board will not; part of the agreement requires that the panel be replaced by the President in consultation with Congressional leaders. Just before the House unanimously approved the compromise, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan, said, ''This is not the be-all and end-all deal that will save Amtrak for all time, but it does save Amtrak at least for the time being.''
1997-11-08	House, in Passing Spending Bill, Limits and Delays Clinton's Testing Program	Laboring under a deadline for adjournment, the House tonight approved a $277 billion spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education that includes a deal to delay and restrict President Clinton's national educational-testing program. The legislation, the largest of the 13 Federal spending bills, passed on a vote of 352 to 65.
1997-11-05	Amtrak Pact Faces a Major Obstacle in Congress	The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said today that the tentative workers' agreement that Amtrak reached on Sunday was ''a total nonstarter.'' And various parties appeared to be maneuvering to avoid being seen as having dealt a fatal blow to the railroad, which is faltering financially.
1997-11-03	Amtrak and Union Reach Tentative Deal	Amtrak and the union representing 2,300 track and tunnel workers have reached ''the basic terms of a new labor agreement,'' the Transportation Secretary said today. For the near future, the tentative agreement averts a threatened strike that would have shut down the Northeast Corridor, from Boston to Washington, and intercity trains all over the East.
1997-11-02	Amtrak Is Fighting Off a Walkout	Almost every afternoon for the last week, a group of union leaders, Transportation Department officials, Amtrak managers and members of Amtrak's Board of Directors have gathered in the office of the Transportation Secretary for discussions that lasted into the early morning hours, with occasional breaks for take-out Chinese food. On the surface, the issue is a contract dispute with 2,300 members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, who have been without a contract for three years and have been threatening to strike, their newest deadline being 12:01 A.M. next Thursday. That strike would close down the Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington and hundreds of long-distance trains east of the Mississippi, and could interfere with commuter service in Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Washington.
1997-10-28	Amtrak Gets An Extension In Deadline	Amtrak and the union representing track maintenance workers agreed tonight to extend a cooling-off period for another eight days, until Nov. 6, averting the threat of a strike at 12:01 A.M. on Wednesday. The parties agreed to extend the cooling-off period, their second extension, at the request of Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, ''in view of significant progress made by the parties,'' said a spokesman for the Transportation Department, William Schulz. Amtrak and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which represents 2,300 track workers, have been meeting almost round-the-clock since Sunday afternoon at the department.
1997-10-27	Deal Near to Keep Commuter Trains Running	The Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit are near agreements with Amtrak and its track workers union that would keep the commuter trains running even if there was an Amtrak strike on Wednesday. But the plans await a final review by all sides at a meeting in Washington today, and officials of the commuter railroads urged riders to prepare for the possibility, slim though it may be, of service disruptions. ''We're optimistic that this agreement will be completed tomorrow,'' said Brian Dolan, an L.I.R.R. spokesman, ''but we're still advising our customers to pick up a special strike timetable and brochure.''
1997-10-26	So Long, Amtrak	To the Editor: So ''Amtrak Courts Riders'' (Travel Advisory, Sept. 21)? Well, this gal's been jilted one time too often. Sorry, Amtrak, the romance has ended.
1997-10-25	G.O.P. Dispute Delays Amtrak Bill in House	Split by a regional division among Republicans, the House of Representatives failed for a third day today to take action on an Amtrak bill that would release $2.3 billion in new capital and change the railroad's labor rules. The disagreement adds more uncertainty to the future of the railroad as it heads for a strike deadline next Tuesday at midnight.
1997-10-24	House Again Delays Vote on Money for Amtrak	The House of Representatives failed for a second day in a row to vote on a bill that is needed to release $2.3 billion that is supposed to pay for new high-speed Amtrak trains. But whether the railroad will actually get the trains is uncertain, because provisions in the bill set limits on liability suits, which the Senate refused to discuss last year. And even if Amtrak gets the money, some officials think it may have to be spent instead on operating expenses, like raises for track workers who are threatening to strike.
1997-10-22	THE FINE PRINT: A closer look at the Amtrak bill.; Rail Bill Would Benefit Private Freight Companies in Lawsuits	As the House this week considers a measure to reauthorize Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, among the most interested onlookers will be the private freight rail companies, which could benefit greatly from an obscure provision in the bill. That item, inserted by members of the House Transportation Committee, would limit for the first time the amount of damages companies like CSX and the Union Pacific Corporation could incur for people injured by the companies' negligence -- even if it was deliberate. And, even more important, those costs would be paid in most cases by Amtrak and ultimately the public treasury.
1997-10-21	Whitman Acts To Minimize Train Trouble Before Nov. 4	Gov. Christine Todd Whitman turned the focus of her re-election campaign today to a problem that is not hers but could still cost her votes with cranky New Jersey commuters: a possible Amtrak strike the week before the election. As supporters of her Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, attacked her on urban issues, Mrs. Whitman appeared today largely in her role as Governor. And she was most strenuously working to reassure voters that she is doing all she can to avert a strike. The vision of voters stuck on the turnpike and wondering whom to blame seemed to inspire a brilliantly concise set of sentences from Mrs. Whitman, in which she simultaneously called on the President to avoid a strike, pushed the blame to the Federal level and praised her own accomplishments.
1997-10-20	Plan to Delay Amtrak Strike Is Accepted	Amtrak management and track workers agreed yesterday on a cooling-off period of at least one week, averting a possible strike on Wednesday that could have wrought havoc on hundreds of thousands of commuters in the New York metropolitan region. Both the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit use track owned by Amtrak and run into Amtrak's Pennsylvania Station, and the threat of a strike by the nationwide railway caused the two regional commuter railroads to develop contingency plans for major disruptions for area commuters. But with the specter of a strike still looming for next week, the railroads continued to try to reach agreements that would allow them to keep the commuter railways operating even if a strike occurred.
1997-10-18	Deal Is Close On Keeping L.I.R.R. Going	With the deadline for an Amtrak strike that could also cripple local commuter railroads just five days away, union leaders and Amtrak reached a tentative agreement yesterday to keep the Long Island Rail Road running into Manhattan even if a strike occurs. The union involved in the labor dispute, which represents track inspectors, agreed to let several dozen workers from other unions cross its picket lines to maintain four miles of Amtrak-owned tracks that connect the L.I.R.R. system with Pennsylvania Station, the destination of most of the L.I.R.R.'s 260,000 daily passengers.
1997-10-17	No Talks, Just Faxes, in Amtrak Dispute	Amtrak and the union that may strike over wages next week did not meet today but traded unfriendly faxes, each making statements that threaten the continued operation of Amtrak and commuter lines across the country. The head of the bargaining committee for the union, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, said today that it had reached an agreement with Metra, the commuter rail agency in the Chicago area, that would allow that line to continue running if there was a strike.
1997-10-17	New Jersey Daily Briefing; Plan Made for Rail Strike	As Amtrak workers dig in for a strike that could cripple New Jersey's commuter and commercial rail lines, state officials announced a plan yesterday to relieve the huge traffic problems a strike could cause. The Department of Transportation said it would press into service 500 additional New Jersey Transit buses to carry some 66,000 rail commuters if the strike, scheduled for Wednesday, occurred.
1997-10-16	Amtrak Prepares for Strike That Might Affect Commuter Lines	The workers who maintain the tracks, bridges and electrical systems for Amtrak could go on strike next Wednesday, shutting down the already weakened railroad and possibly the major commuter operations in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington. Although the union says that if it strikes it does not want to disrupt the commuter lines, which carry 531,000 passengers a day, Amtrak and several rail experts say that would be highly unlikely.
1997-10-08	New Jersey Daily Briefing; Call to Avert Amtrak Strike	Two weeks before a Federal cooling-off period is due to expire, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman yesterday called on Amtrak workers and Federal officials to avert a labor strike that she said could cripple New Jersey's commuter and commercial rail systems. At a news conference in Newark's Pennsylvania Station, Mrs. Whitman said a strike by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, whose members maintain Amtrak's bridges and rails, could send hundreds of thousands of New Jersey commuters onto the state's overburdened highways and paralyze cargo deliveries.
1997-10-08	U.S. SAFETY BOARD CRITICIZES AMTRAK IN '96 DERAILMENT	The Amtrak train derailment last November in Secaucus, N.J., which sent three coaches tumbling down an embankment and injured 42 people, occurred largely because Amtrak's top managers were more interested in keeping the trains running than in assuring safety, the National Transportation Safety Board said today. The board was unusually harsh in its criticism of Amtrak, painting a picture of a railroad in which top officials sent the wrong message about priorities to underlings. The board said management turnover was so rapid that no one in the field had any experience with the complicated piece of track where the break occurred, even though it had been installed less than five years earlier.
1997-09-21	In a Fight for Its Life, Amtrak Courts Riders	SINCE it was created by Congress in 1970, Amtrak has come close to being permanently derailed any number of times. Last month a dispute between Congress and the Clinton Administration over Amtrak employees' severance pay led Congress to withhold the $2.3 billion in capital funds that it had voted for the railroad, and soon after that crisis passed the subsidy narrowly escaped a Presidential line-item veto. Now if Congress completes action this month on a bill to streamline Amtrak, and if the railroad and about 2,500 of its maintenance workers use the 60-day cooling-off period imposed by President Clinton on Aug. 21 to settle a threatened strike, Amtrak should have a pretty good indication by this time next year whether it can actually become self-sufficient by 2002, as Congress has decreed it must.
1997-09-16	Derailed Train Cuts Service At Penn Station	A New Jersey Transit train derailed yesterday as it passed over a switch on its way into Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. No one was hurt, in the second derailment in a week for the system. But the derailment, at 10 A.M., several hundred feet shy of the train's platform, blocked access to 9 of the 21 tracks at the station and caused delays of up to 20 minutes for evening riders of New Jersey Transit, Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road, officials said.
1997-09-04	F.B.I. Memorandum on Crime Was Mistakenly Sent to Press	A confidential F.B.I. memorandum identifying a possible suspect in a fatal train derailment in the Arizona desert was sent by mistake this week to news organizations throughout the state, officials said today. The memorandum was supposed to have been sent from the Phoenix office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the United States Attorney's office in the same city. Instead, it was faxed on Tuesday to newspapers and television and radio stations, said Jack Callahan, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in Phoenix.
1997-09-02	As Tourism Rides Rails, New Barons Gain Clout	Town officials might have thought they had the final word in June when they refused a request by the Durango and Silverton tourist railroad for the exclusive right to sell photographs of tourists standing in front of the line's antique locomotives. But then, at the height of the tourist season, trains mysteriously started squealing to a halt four blocks short of the center of town here.
1997-08-31	East Coast Leaf Peeping By Boat and by Train	Until Oct. 25, travelers searching for fall colors can combine ship and rail travel between the East Coast and Canada, with a six-night cruise on the Dreamward of Norwegian Cruise Lines, or a nine-night cruise on the Westerdam of Holland America Line, and a train ride on the Adirondack, operated by Amtrak through the Hudson and Champlain valleys in New York State. The ships sail between New York and Montreal (you pick up the train at either end), calling variously at Newport, R.I.; Boston; Portland and Bar Harbor, Me.; Halifax; Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; the Saguenay Fjord and Quebec City. Fares range from $1,295 to $1,995 a person in double occupancy for the six-night cruises and from $1,595 to $3,735 for the nine-night cruises. Coach accommodations on the train are included, and passengers may make connections to the Adirondack from many East Coast cities, among them Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston.
1997-08-22	President Intervenes to Block Strike Next Month at Amtrak	President Clinton acted today to postpone for 60 days a possible nationwide strike against Amtrak. The move came just two days after the United Parcel Service and the teamsters' union tentatively settled a two-week walkout without such Presidential intervention. Invoking the Railway Labor Act, a 1920's law that was not applicable in the U.P.S. strike, Mr. Clinton created a three-member Presidential emergency board to investigate and try to help resolve the dispute between Amtrak and workers represented by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees. While the board works over the next two months, the union cannot strike.
1997-08-10	A Train Derails In Arizona On a Rain-Damaged Bridge	An eastbound Amtrak passenger train carrying 325 people partially derailed as it sped across a rain-damaged trestle bridge in the northwest Arizona desert early yesterday, officials said. Scores were injured, about 50 seriously and a few critically, but no deaths were reported in what appeared to be an accident. One of four engines and 10 of 16 cars of the Southwest Chief jumped the tracks as the bridge spanning a small gulch buckled under it 13 miles east of Kingman, Ariz., at about 5 A.M. The engine overturned, one passenger coach rolled on its side and nine others were left zigzagged but upright on the tracks.
1997-07-31	Amtrak Money Is Stalled in Dispute Over Law on Job Protection	An impasse between Republicans and Democrats led today to the freezing of $2.3 billion in Federal money that had been intended to upgrade Amtrak, the national passenger railroad. Unless the dispute is resolved, said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, Amtrak faces bankruptcy next spring.
1997-07-11	Scaled-Down Plan Approved for New Amtrak Station	After a delay of a year and a half caused by conflicts over personnel and rising budget estimates, city, state and Federal officials agreed yesterday to move forward with a $315 million project to build a new Amtrak railroad station in the General Post Office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. Work is expected to begin soon on new passenger platforms beneath the James A. Farley Building, the 84-year-old edifice that fills two blocks along Eighth Avenue and which will be converted into a passenger station, shops and a food court.
1997-07-06	One-Stop Shopping For Land, Sea and Air	Travelers can now combine air and rail travel anywhere in the United States that is served by United Airlines or Amtrak, customizing their tours, called Amtrak Adventures, with hotel stays, sightseeing tours, transfers and car rentals. For example, to visit Glacier National Park in Montana, passengers can fly to Seattle, spend two nights there, take a city tour, ride the Empire Builder to Glacier, take a circle tour of the park during a two-night stay, board the train to Chicago, spend two nights there, take a trolley tour and a lunch cruise on Lake Michigan and fly home. From New York, this package, called Big Sky America, costs $1,429 a person in double occupancy until Aug. 31, $1,289 in September and October. Rocky Mountain America includes a flight to San Francisco, two nights in a hotel there, a trolley tour and a cruise on San Francisco Bay, followed by a ride on the California Zephyr from Oakland to Denver, two nights in a hotel and a sightseeing tour in Denver and the flight home. Price: $1,439 a person until Aug. 31, $1,389 in September and October.
1997-06-18	Safety Board Says Signal System Led to Fatal Train Crash in '96	A poorly designed signal system encouraged a railroad engineer's error and contributed to a collision of two trains in Maryland last year that killed 11 people, the National Transportation Safety Board said today. Although the signal system was part of a $90 million improvement paid for with Federal money, it was never tested for safety by the Government, the board said.
1997-05-29	The Memorial Day holiday seems to set the pace, with the big airlines expecting a strong summer.	AIR travel over Memorial Day appears to have broken the record for that holiday period, as the Air Transport Association had forecast, and travel the rest of the summer seems headed for a record. The association had predicted 1.96 million passengers would fly last Thursday, and that day Delta Air Lines alone boarded 343,573 passengers -- making it the second-busiest day in the carrier's history. The next day, Delta exceeded last Thursday's totals, flying 354,155 passengers. That still fell short of the airline's busiest day -- Dec. 1, 1996, the Sunday of the Thanksgiving weekend, when it flew 361,524 passengers.
1997-05-11	Amtrak Gets Late Start On Summer Schedule	Amtrak's summer timetables go into effect today, a month later than usual. The railroad continued its fall-winter schedule after the change to daylight time in April, the usual switchover date. R. Clifford Black 4th, the railroad's chief spokesman, said the anomaly arose from actions by Congress extending the operation of certain trains for six months, a period that ended yesterday. The new Northeast Corridor schedule has an additional daily train leaving Boston at 6:10 P.M. and arriving in Washington at 3:05 A.M.; this formerly operated only Friday and Sunday. In the other direction, the railroad has added a Sunday-to-Friday train leaving Washington at 5:30 A.M., and arriving in Boston at 1:50 P.M.
1997-04-26	Train Service Is Disrupted	A section of electrical wires powering trains between Newark and New York City collapsed Friday afternoon, disrupting rush-hour service for 21,000 commuters, officials said. The wires for two tracks used by New Jersey Transit and Amtrak collapsed near Secaucus shortly after noon and were repaired at 4:30 P.M., but delays of 30 minutes to an hour continued into the evening because of reduced train speeds, officials said. Construction on an access road near the tracks in Secaucus shook a foundation that holds a pole supporting the electrical wires, and caused the wires to come down onto the tracks, an Amtrak spokeswoman said.
1997-04-19	Fire Near Station Disrupts Train Service	Train service on Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road was disrupted yesterday evening when fire broke out aboard an Amtrak engine heading into Pennsylvania Station after being serviced at the Sunnyside Yards in Queens. Amtrak reported that the fire, at about 5 P.M., caused delays of 20 to 40 minutes in its service, and scattered delays of 5 to 10 minutes on the New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road lines. Normal service was restored by about 7:15 P.M., Amtrak said.
1997-03-25	Part of Amtrak Back At DDB Needham	DDB Needham New York has won back a portion of the Amtrak account, involving national brand advertising, that the agency had lost during a review last April. Though billings were not disclosed, the trade publication Advertising Age estimated that they would almost double this year from an estimated $8 million last year.
1997-02-12	Poetry for the People	Passengers on Amtrak today will find a freebie: paperback copies of ''Great Love Poems'' (Dover Publications, 1992), a compendium of amorous verse by such masters as Andrew Marvell and Edna St. Vincent Millay. On Friday, Valentine's Day, copies will be waiting for jurors at the state's criminal courts in lower Manhattan, and for shoppers at the Lancome counter at Macy's in Herald Square. In all, 15,000 books will be given away, most of them on Amtrak's East Coast lines, but thousands more at places as varied as the Division of Motor Vehicles in Washington, the subway in Boston and a homeless shelter in San Diego.
1997-01-26	Venetian Fantasy Still Afloat in a Usually Waterless Canal	For some time Alexander Brodsky, a Russian artist, had wanted to ''do something big underground'' in New York's cavernous subway system. While wandering around the Canal Street station at Broadway last winter, Mr. Brodsky noticed a long section of track idled for renovation. In a flash of inspiration, he thought: Subway tracks! Canal Street! Why not make big gondolas and float them underground?
1996-12-19	Train Trip to Vermont Offers Some of the Fun	It's a cold, blustery night in New York. The roads are slick with ice; snow is blowing sideways in a whiteout as opaque as sheets on a clothesline. Yet you want to go skiing. Not a bad idea, say Vermont ski resorts. But instead of driving, take the train the way skiers once did in the 1930's and 1940's. ''If you think about driving out of Manhattan on a Friday night,'' said John Clifford, vice president for marketing at the Killington, Vt., resort, ''I'm convinced it's just as convenient and fast as driving your own car.''
1996-12-01	Vermont-Bound Skiers Get One More Train	Starting tomorrow, Amtrak, with financial assistance from Vermont, is scheduled to add a second daily train into the state's ski areas. Augmenting the service along the Connecticut River provided by the Vermonter, the Ethan Allen Express will leave Penn Station in New York seven afternoons a week to travel up the Hudson River to Whitehall, N.Y., and then east to Rutland, Vt. Rutland provides access to Killington and Pico in Killington, Okemo Mountain in Ludlow, Sugarbush in Warren and Stowe Mountain. These resorts expect to provide transfers from the station either for a separate fee or as part of a package. As an example, a ride to Killington costs $10 for a round trip. The return train will also operate daily, but at varied hours. Lift tickets and reports on conditions will be available aboard the Ethan Allen. A cafe car with sandwiches, snacks and beverages will be on the train.
1996-12-01	Concern for Rail Safety Follows a Bridge Accident	When An Amtrak train ran off the tracks in Secaucus, N. J., last weekend, it raised concern about a whole class of bridges and renewed a debate over making all railroad bridges safer. The accident, which injured 34 people, was caused by a displaced rail on a swing bridge, one that turns to let boats pass, on the Hackensack River. The Federal Railroad Administration promised to inspect all of the country's estimated 200 moveable bridges by year's end.
1996-11-30	Failure of Ticket Computer Snarls Amtrak at Busy Time	The computer system that controls Amtrak's reservations and ticketing for the entire country broke down yesterday, leaving many riders on the busiest travel weekend of the year standing in long lines as clerks wrote out tickets by hand. Ticket agents around the country lacked printed tables of fares and were unable to look them up on their computers. In some cases, they just guessed, leading some riders to complain that they had overpaid.
1996-11-29	Rail Accident Stirs Debate About Sensors	The derailment last Saturday of an Amtrak passenger train in Secaucus, N.J., has renewed a long-running debate about the feasibility of sensors that can tell when a bridge or its rails have been knocked out of alignment and warn approaching trains to stop. The National Transportation Safety Board, unions representing railroad workers and some independent experts who are often at odds with the industry say that the technology exists for practical, affordable sensing systems and that they would be particularly useful at heavily used bridges like the one in Secaucus. But the railroad industry insists that that technology remains nothing more than science fiction, and the Federal Railroad Administration, the agency that could require the devices, says they cost too much.
1996-11-28	Train Kills Worker	A high-speed Amtrak train struck and killed a track worker in Secaucus, N.J., yesterday morning shortly after 6 A.M. The worker, Aaron King, 53, of North Bergen, N.J., was hit by a southbound Metroliner about a mile from where another Amtrak train jumped the tracks on Saturday. There was no apparent connection.
1996-11-26	U.S. Inspectors Seeking Flaws In Rail Bridges	Federal regulators said yesterday that they planned to inspect all of the nation's 200 or so moving railroad bridges after a misaligned rail on a moving bridge across the Hackensack River knocked an Amtrak train off the tracks early Saturday and sent it careening into a marsh in Secaucus, N.J. Federal Railroad Administration inspectors will look at every moving bridge by Dec. 31, said Edward R. English, the agency's director of safety, who added that the bridges had worked well for decades. ''We're going to be looking for any problem that may exist, but frankly, I don't expect to find any,'' he said.
1996-11-25	Broken Bars on Drawbridge Are Blamed in Amtrak Crash	Federal investigators said last night that an Amtrak train derailed on a swing bridge in New Jersey on Saturday because a rupture of two small plates left two connecting rails piggybacked, one atop another, instead of end to end. The preliminary conclusions raised the possibility that across the nation, more than 100 railroad swing bridges -- those that swivel open at river crossings to allow boat traffic to pass -- might have problems similar to those that led to the accident.
1996-11-25	Train Service Resumes, With Delays	All of Amtrak's service and most of New Jersey Transit's operations were restored yesterday, officials for the railroads said, but delays of 45 minutes or more were reported. New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct, which normally operates from Dover to New York City, offered limited service. Penny Bassett Hackett, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit, said Midtown Direct service terminated yesterday in Hoboken, where passengers could take PATH trains or ferries into Manhattan.
1996-11-24	Northeast Corridor Line Shut Down	Yesterday's derailment shut down Amtrak's service to its Northeast Corridor, as well as to much of New Jersey Transit's operations. But the rail service would have at least one track back in operation by today, said R. Clifford Black 4th, an Amtrak spokesman. He suggested that travelers call Amtrak at (800)-USA-RAIL for ''up-to-the-minute information.''
1996-11-24	On Bridge That Has Served Fast Trains and Slow Tugs, Investigators Find Troubling Sign	For years, the Portal Bridge has quietly served its purpose to transportation and commerce. It has withstood the weight of trains rumbling across its back, and it has swung open to make way for tugs and barges to glide along the Hackensack River below. But last night this distant cousin to the metropolitan area's great bridges found itself suddenly in the spotlight, as investigators sought to determine what role it had played in the early-morning derailment of an Amtrak Fast Mail train that sent rail cars plunging into the marshlands of Secaucus, N.J.
1996-11-24	Amtrak Derailment in Secaucus Marsh Injures 32	An Amtrak fast-mail train approaching New York with 108 passengers and crew members derailed as it crossed a Hackensack River swing bridge on a desolate New Jersey meadowland early yesterday. After sideswiping an oncoming passenger train, six cars of the mail train plunged down a 30-foot embankment. No one was killed, but Amtrak said 32 people were injured and dozens were shaken and terrified as the train -- a dozen passenger and mail cars behind twin locomotives -- was wrecked at 6:33 A.M. at the Portal Bridge in the marshes of Secaucus. The site is a mile from the junction where two New Jersey Transit commuter trains collided last February, killing 3 people and injuring 162.
1996-10-06	By Train to Montreal, Through Autumn	The Adirondack train linking Penn Station in New York with Montreal got refurbished equipment this fall from its sponsors, Amtrak and New York State. The smooth-riding Heritage cars, formerly coaches on the New York-Philadelphia Clocker trains, have been redecorated and fitted with luggage and ski racks. As a way to see autumn colors along the Hudson, around Saratoga Springs or Glens Falls, Lake George or Lake Champlain, and north near Lake Placid, this trip of 381 miles one way is hard to beat. Stops along the route include Poughkeepsie, Rhinecliff, Saratoga Springs, Glens Falls, Port Kent on Lake Champlain and Rouses Point near the Canadian border. The all-reserved train, with a cafe-lounge car with a full bar, leaves Penn Station at 8:30 A.M. Monday to Saturday, arriving in Montreal about 6 P.M. The Sunday trip leaves at 12:50 P.M. (10:35 A.M. after Nov. 10). The return trip leaves Montreal at 10:40 A.M. seven days a week (12:45 P.M. Sunday after Nov. 10). The fare varies by how early a ticket is purchased: the cheap price is $56 each way; bought late, tickets are $76 each way. Amtrak: (800) 872-7245.
1996-09-30	Upgrading Train Tracks	Amtrak and New Jersey Transit will spend $250 million over the next five years to upgrade 58 miles of track they share on the New York-to-Trenton line, officials said Friday. The agencies will replace wooden ties with smoother, longer-lasting concrete ones, repair overhead power lines and replace air-powered switches, which can freeze in the winter, with electrical ones. The track was last overhauled in the 1930's. Amtrak, which owns the track, and New Jersey Transit, which pays $26 million a year to use it, will share the cost, said Jeff Maclin, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit.
1996-09-25	Lake Shore Route	To the Editor: Your Sept. 20 editorial on Amtrak service cuts to rail lines serving the central United States does not mention the proposal to eliminate the Boston-to-Albany leg of the Lake Shore Limited, a train that many of my constituents and your readers rely on for travel to cities like Buffalo, Cleveland and Chicago. An underfinanced Amtrak has made the decision to reduce its budget by cutting this line, even though the line is generating a profit.
1996-09-25	Rebuild Infrastructure	To the Editor: You worry about politically available ways to endow Amtrak (editorial, Sept. 20), but there's an easy solution to any fear that the $5 billion a year that would flow from dedicating the 4.3-cent gas tax to the National Highway Trust Fund would unleash a highway building program. Congress could mark these funds for rebuilding, not expanding, what we have. Transit would gain, too. In addition to the $600 million off the top that Congress proposes to give to Amtrak, states have had the flexibility under Federal law since 1991 to assign Federal dollars either to roads or transit. In New York City, about 65 percent of capital dollars goes to upgrade transit, and in the region, transit gets a little more than half.
1996-09-23	Why Pour Money Into Failed Amtrak System?	To the Editor: ''The Trains Are Leaving'' (editorial, Sept. 20) concludes by endorsing a failed strategy: Amtrak's decades-long effort to maintain a ''national rail passenger system.''
1996-09-22	Smoke Free	To the Editor: I did not recognize the ''smoke free'' Amtrak described by Adam Bryant in ''On the Ground, a Few Chances to Light Up'' (June 30). On a recent trip from Minneapolis to Ardmore, Pa., I found that the Empire Builder, Capitol Limited and Three Rivers trains were actually quite smoky in certain places. The observation car on the first two trains contained two designated smoking sections, partitioned only by narrow plexiglass strips on either side of the aisle that allowed plenty of smoke to circulate throughout the nonsmoking section sandwiched between them. The Three Rivers train had no observation car, so the cafe car contained the smoking section, which had no partitions to divide it from the nonsmoking section. BARBARA BROWNE Gladwyne, Pa.
1996-09-20	The Trains Are Leaving	You cannot ride a train from Dallas to Houston or from Cincinnati to Cleveland. Those trains have left, and across a land originally stitched together with railroad tracks, passenger service is in a downward spiral of neglect, curtailment, customer estrangement and route cancellations. America could wake up in the 21st century to find only freight on its tracks while its highways choke with traffic. Or Congress could wake up and give Amtrak, the starving rail-passenger company, a fighting chance. It could endow Amtrak with a dependable source of capital by setting aside half a billion dollars a year for the next five years to build a capital fund for equipment and infrastructure. That would enable the company to meet its deadline of no operating subsidy by 2002. Amtrak could buy the cars, improve the tracks and maintain a system that will attract more passengers and revenue, ending the need for operating subsidies. Amtrak could hold the line on train abandonments and restore strength to its dwindling national network.
1996-09-15	The Oregon Trail, by Rail	IF you're looking for train memorabilia, however arcane, you can find it at Grandpa's Depot Store, on the second floor of the Oxford Hotel annex in Denver, across Wynkoop Street from Union Station. There, amid antique railroad lanterns, Union Pacific martini sets and matchbooks from the old Rio Grande line, you can also find Grandpa John White, who's spent a lifetime watching trains come and go. When I met him on a hot afternoon in late July and told him of my plan to ride Amtrak's Pioneer train all the way from Denver to Portland, Ore., he said, in perfect deadpan, ''The Government runs it, you know. They don't have a timetable anymore. They just post the day the train's expected.'' I had a timetable, though -- along with an itinerary sent to me by Amtrak's Great American Vacations, a book on the Lewis and Clark Expedition (''Undaunted Courage'' by Stephen Ambrose) and expectations for the trip almost as high as those of Meriwether Lewis when he paddled into the Missouri River on May 21, 1804. The train's route touches that of Lewis and Clark along the Columbia River, and follows portions of the Oregon Trail, as well -- you could call it Manifest Destiny on wheels. In Wyoming it passes south of pioneer landmarks like Devil's Gate and Independence Rock to join up with the wagon trains around Boise, Idaho; it follows and then leaves the Snake River behind where the settlers did, at Farewell Bend in eastern Oregon, provides bracing views of Mount Hood and the gorge of the Columbia River (the pioneers' two last great hurdles), and finally glides into the promised land of the Willamette Valley.
1996-09-02	Whistle-Stop Hypocrisy	To the Editor: Has anyone else noticed the irony, not to mention the hypocrisy, of President Clinton's whistle-stop train tour to Chicago? Days before the start of the tour, Amtrak announced another round of service cuts, including the severing of several major passenger-rail arteries across the country. This is the second such retrenchment to occur in this Administration.
1996-08-21	Amtrak Shows Favoritism in Service Cuts	To the Editor: Amtrak's decision to eliminate trains on three Western routes, including the vital Chicago-to-Texas service, had little to do with either declining ridership or air competition as your Aug. 16 news article suggests. Amtrak knowingly cut its ridership as much as two-thirds when it reduced service from seven days a week to three. Few travelers can work their plans around such irregular trains. As Amtrak admits, a tri-weekly train is hardly better than no train at all. It also makes it impossible to bid for mail-carrying contracts.
1996-08-18	Amtrak Rejuggles Its Routes Nationwide	Amtrak recently announced a restructured schedule, to begin Nov. 10, that ends service at 42 stations nationwide while increasing it at 131 stations. Although Federal appropriations for fiscal year 1997 (beginning this October) have not been finalized, Amtrak anticipates receiving only $200 million of the $250 million it sought. Service will end on the Boston-Albany leg of the Lakeshore Limited (bus service will replace it); the St. Louis-San Antonio leg of the Texas Eagle; the Desert Wind, which links Chicago, Denver, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Los Angeles (the California Zephyr will continue daily between Chicago and Salt Lake City); and the Denver-Seattle segment of the Pioneer (the Zephyr replaces the Pioneer's Chicago-Denver leg).
1996-08-16	A Last Blast Of the Whistle Coming Soon	This city was so charmed by its old train depot, and so enchanted by the mystique of locomotive travel, that it mounted a $1.5 million campaign to buy the station. The donations poured in, with corporate bigwigs and working-class Joes and Janes helping the city buy the depot from a private company last month.
1996-07-27	Move High-Speed Train Idea Away From Coast	To the Editor: John Henry (letter, July 19) is off the mark in criticizing boat and marina owners' objections to Amtrak's plans to add more and faster trains between New York and Boston and require drawbridges in Connecticut to close for longer periods of time.
1996-07-19	Don't Let Boaters Sink Amtrak's Expansion	"To the Editor: How sad it is that people in Connecticut who make their livelihood from big pleasure boats -- including gas-guzzling cabin cruisers -- might derail Amtrak's plans to add more and faster trains between New York and Boston (""Storm Brews Along Shore: Amtrak Plans Alarm Boaters,"" news article, July 15)."
1996-07-15	Storm Brews Along Shore: Amtrak Plans Alarm Boaters;Threat of Bridge Tie-ups Could Derail an Effort To Add Faster Trains	David J. Carol likes to take his son to Dad's Restaurant on Main Street here to sit on the deck and watch the Amtrak drawbridge over the Niantic River open for sailboats and fishing boats and close for trains. Mostly he likes to see the bridge open, and stay open. For Mr. Carol is in charge of Amtrak's plan to run high-speed trains between New York and Boston, and the final permits needed for the $1.7-billion project hinge on Amtrak's assurances that bullet trains will not interfere with boaters along the Connecticut shoreline. And what piping plovers are to beachgoers, Connecticut boaters have proved to be for Amtrak: part of the protected shoreline system.
1996-06-09	A Vision of Wheeled Fun In Amtrak's Wasteland	"To the Editor: As an owner of West Side real estate since 1962, I can attest to the deplorable conditions of the Amtrak rail depression all these years (""Where Anger Rides the Rails,"" May 12). During the 1970's, I sent a letter of complaint to the Mayor's office. I also recommended converting this wasted land into a bicycle and joggers' path with no response."
1996-06-07	Rail Projects, for Airport Link And Freight, Gain Approval	Port Authority directors approved two rail projects yesterday, one intended to move people to Newark International Airport and the other to move freight from the sea. The first project is a $250 million extension of the Newark airport monorail that will connect the monorail with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line. The extension, expected to be finished by the fall of the year 2000, will allow passengers on Amtrak or New Jersey Transit to transfer directly to the new monorail, which connects the terminals and parking lots at Newark Airport. The monorail began operating last week.
1996-06-04	Fallen Rubble Blocks Trains	Downtown traffic was tied up for several hours and Amtrak and New Jersey Transit train service was disrupted up to 30 minutes yesterday afternoon when a chunk of ornamental concrete fell onto Market Street from the trestle leading into Pennsylvania Station here, an Amtrak spokesman said. No one was injured, said the spokesman, Richard S. Remington. Inspectors determined that the trestle was structurally sound, he said.
1996-05-12	Where Anger Rides the Rails	With the spring heat rising in Hell's Kitchen, Clinton residents' wary eyes are turning to the Amtrak railroad tracks, which they say are a growing neighborhood blight that the rail line has resisted clearing up. The tracks, which run between 10th and 11th Avenues in the 40's in a 30-foot depression, are largely hidden from view.
1996-04-14	Direct to Midtown, 21 Times a Day	Direct rail service to Manhattan from North Jersey is only two months away. On June 10, New Jersey Transit plans to start direct service to midtown Manhattan for passengers on the Morris and Essex Line. Commuters will be able to travel to Penn Station in New York without transferring to the PATH in Hoboken, saving up to 20 minutes each way. (Trains will still run to Hoboken for links to lower Manhattan.)
1996-04-14	Stubs for Passes	Amtrak does not show movies on its trains, but it's offering the next best thing. Customers who buy Northeast Direct tickets (a service that links 44 cities from Boston to Newport News, Va.) worth $35 or more in April or May can get two free tickets to a movie at United Artists and Sony/ Loews theaters in the Northeast. To get the movie passes passengers must mail in a form, available at Amtrak stations, and their train-ticket stubs. Information: (800) 872-7245.
1996-04-11	On Amtrak, Poetry In Motion	"Most of the passengers riding the Amtrak Metroliner to Washington today acted like the business people they were. In one car, a woman typed on her laptop while the man across from her talked into his cellular phone. A man in another seat scribbled furiously on a yellow legal pad. Beside him, someone was reading The Wall Street Journal. And then there was Jonathan Oatis, an editor for Reuters news service, seemingly enthralled by a book of poetry. ""Frankly, I don't read poetry that much anymore,"" said Mr. Oatis, who was en route to Washington to lead a seminar to teach journalists about the Internet. ""It's not that I dislike poetry. I'm just more of a prose person."""
1996-04-07	A Revised Amtrak Pass For Spring and Summer	Amtrak has revised and renamed its version of the rail pass for this summer. New Explore America fares allow 30 days of travel around one, two or all three regions of the lower 48 states. Unlimited stopovers are permitted -- they must be scheduled in advance -- but passengers generally may not travel twice over the same route in the same direction. The earlier version of this promotion, called All Aboard America, allowed only limited stopovers, although it was about $10 lower across the board. For 30 days' travel from April 1 until June 16, adult fares are $158 for a single region, $198 for two regions and $278 for the entire Amtrak system. Summer prices, in effect from June 16 until Aug. 18, are $50 higher, but any trip begun before June 16 qualifies for the spring price. Children 2 to 15 traveling with an adult pay half fare; discounts are available for students and the elderly. May 15 is the deadline for buying the passes and for making reservations for all parts of the trip. Changes in itinerary are not permitted and the fare is nonrefundable.
1996-04-03	Second Agency Is Added by Amtrak	Amtrak has added Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York to its roster by dividing its account, with billings estimated at $40 million, between that agency and DDB Needham New York, the lead Amtrak shop for the last 23 years. Bob Wehrmann, vice president for national marketing and sales at Amtrak in Washington, said that Ammirati, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, would handle the national and intercity parts of the account, with billings estimated at $25 million. DDB Needham, part of the Omnicom Group, retained duties for advertising Amtrak routes along the Northeast Corridor and West Coast, he added, with billings estimated at $15 million.
1996-03-17	Amtrak Begins Charge For Changing Tickets	Amtrak has begun charging a fee for changing many of its tickets or for getting a refund. The fee is $20 a ticket, $10 for children. Trains in the Northeast corridor -- that is, between Boston, New York and Washington -- as well as the Empire Service in New York State and the Adirondack and Vermonter trains are exempt because the competing airline shuttles require no reservations and thus no penalties for change, according to Jim Cooper, the national fare manager for Amtrak.
1996-03-16	2 BUILDERS CHOSEN FOR SPEEDY TRAINS ON NORTHEAST RUN	"Taking a decisive step in its ambitious plans to upgrade train service in the Northeast and give the airlines a run for their money, Amtrak today chose the contractors to build a $611 million fleet of ""American Flyers"" that would cut the time of train service between Washington and Boston by two hours. The top speed of the new trains, 150 miles an hour, is 25 miles an hour faster than trains now travel between New York and Washington, and 50 miles faster than between New York and Boston."
1996-03-13	Immediate Inspection of Rail Cars Is Sought	Federal safety inspectors urgently recommended today that all commuter rail cars be inspected immediately to make sure passengers can escape if there is a crash. The National Transportation Safety Board action followed a collision in Maryland on Feb. 16 that killed 11 people. The safety board urged the Federal Railroad Administration to inspect commuter rail cars nationwide and to issue emergency orders to correct unsafe conditions. It also called on the Maryland Mass Transit Administration to modify its commuter cars to provide better signs, easily used quick-release mechanisms for doors and removable windows or kick panels on doors.
1996-03-11	If Amtrak Pays Damages, We All Pay	"To the Editor: Amtrak appreciates your support in your March 2 editorial (""No Caps on Damages for Railroads"") for a dedicated capital trust fund for American passenger rail, but questions your opposition to capping punitive damages."
1996-03-02	No Caps on Damages for Railroads	"The recent rash of train accidents makes this a most inappropriate time for Congress to set limits on the damages railroads must pay to victims of proven negligence. Yet the Senate will soon consider a bill that may include caps on punitive damages, and the House has already approved a measure capping both ""pain and suffering"" and punitive damage awards. Congress should eliminate these damages provisions before passing the broader Amtrak bill of which they are a part. Private damage lawsuits give teeth to laws and regulations by compensating those injured by safety lapses and punishing organizations whose negligence caused an accident. How well the protective regulations work is the subject of Senate Commerce Committee hearings into several crashes and derailments, including collisions in New Jersey and Maryland that killed 14 passengers. Senators will also be investigating the effectiveness of agencies like the Federal Railroad Administration."
1996-02-28	Officials Split On Improving Train Safety	Techniques and technology needed to help prevent or limit the severity of railroad accidents like more than a dozen that have occurred across the nation in the last two months have existed for years, safety officials, union leaders and elected representatives testified today at hearings before Congress and the Maryland Legislature. But the officials differed on how to implement the safety techniques, and experts held out little hope of major improvement soon.
1996-02-26	Failure to Make Trains Safer Is a Crime;Plan for Human Error	"To the Editor: Re ""In the Train Wrecks' Aftermath"" (editorial, Feb. 21): The common cause of the two railroad tragedies -- human factors -- is neither new nor unknown to the railroad industry or the Department of Transportation."
1996-02-26	Failure to Make Trains Safer Is a Crime	"To the Editor: ""In the Train Wrecks' Aftermath"" (editorial, Feb. 21) notes that many safety hazards in our nation's rail system need examination and correction as a result of the two tragedies that occurred in New Jersey and Maryland."
1996-02-24	Service for 8 In Job Corps Fills Some With Anger	Families of four of the eight Job Corps trainees killed last week in a Maryland train crash joined the victims' classmates here today for a memorial service that paid as much tribute to the Job Corps program as to the dead. After the hourlong service, at the Harpers Ferry Job Corps center, where the victims had been in training, some trainees said the emphasis had been all wrong. And Charon Rothmiller, a cousin of one of those killed, felt so strongly about it that she spontaneously asked during the middle of the service whether she could speak.
1996-02-21	In the Train Wrecks' Aftermath	Two train collisions seven days apart have brought calamity to the ordinarily quiet and safe commuter systems of New York and Washington D.C. Federal and local officials are responding with intense investigations and emergency measures. They have already found some surprising soft spots in the rail network's safety rules and practices. New Jersey Transit, responding to the metropolitan region's worst commuter train crash in 38 years, quickly eliminated the nighttime split shift that enabled an engineer to work extra-long hours just before his train collided with another on Feb. 9. There was no need to await final analyses of what caused the accident to discontinue a work arrangement that was inherently hazardous.
1996-02-21	U.S. Orders Passenger Trains to Slow Down After Some Stations	After 14 deaths in commuter train wrecks in the last 14 days, the Transportation Department today issued emergency procedures intended to reduce the speed of the trains after they leave stations where there are no signals.. The department also issued rules governing equipment that will affect every rail passenger operation in the country, including Amtrak. In addition, changes in procedures will apply to parts of 12 commuter systems, including small parts of the Long Island Rail Road, the Metro North Railroad and a large part of New Jersey Transit.
1996-02-20	Train Survivors Couldn't See How to Exit	"Smoke and flames were filling the front car of the commuter train, drenched with diesel fuel from the Amtrak locomotives it had just hit. Damian Benitez, one of 18 people in the car, ran to the doors and tried to open them. ""I was feeling all over the doors,"" said Mr. Benitez, 19, ""all up on the top, all around the window. I couldn't find a handle, I couldn't find an emergency trigger, anything like that."""
1996-02-19	Hopes Cut Short After Brief, Tough Lives	They were studying to become nurses aides, carpenters and bricklayers and trying to overcome what they saw as bad decisions that were holding them back. Some had dropped out of school. Some could not find jobs. Some came from troubled families. Some were drug users. But all eight of the Job Corps trainees who died on Friday night in Silver Spring, Md., when the commuter train they were on crashed into an Amtrak locomotive had expectations of a brighter future.
1996-02-19	Amtrak Train Kills Small Boy	A 4-year-old boy was killed and a man nearly lost a leg when they were hit by an Amtrak train traveling from San Diego to Los Angeles on Saturday. The man and the boy were walking alongside railroad tracks. The boy who died, Christian Endoso, was apparently a neighbor of the man, John Allison, 36. Mr. Allison was flown to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, where doctors reattached his leg.
1996-02-19	Investigators Citing Design Flaw And Engineer Error in Accident	Investigators suggested today that some of the 11 people killed in a head-on train collision on Friday might have lived if emergency exits had operated properly. The investigators also suggested that the accident was the result of operator error and design flaw. Passengers were unable to open some of the windows and doors on one of the trains, a Maryland Rail Commuter train, said John J. Goglia, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. All of the deaths occurred in the front car of that train, which caught fire after it was drenched with diesel fuel from the Amtrak train it had hit. The board may issue emergency recommendations on such exits soon, Mr. Goglia said.
1996-02-18	8 Trainees From Job Corps Among Train Crash Victims	The victims of a head-on collision here on Friday evening between a fast-moving commuter train and an Amtrak train included eight young trainees from a Federal Job Corps program, officials said today. A total of 11 people died in the accident, which occurred when the Chicago-bound Amtrak train was switching back onto a parallel track after passing a freight train, Federal officials said.
1996-02-18	Amtrak Adds Incentives For Frequent Riders	Amtrak has introduced two incentive programs for frequent riders of the Metroliner and the Empire service in New York State. Members of the programs, called Executive Privileges, qualify for rewards by taking at least four one-way trips each quarter; qualifying trips do not roll over from one quarter to another. Rewards are issued automatically to members every three months and include hotel discounts, MCI prepaid phone cards, a coupon for shopping at Bloomingdale's and free weekend train tickets. For example, four trips in a quarter earn participants a Transmedia restaurant card, a Metroliner or Empire Club Class upgrade and a 20 percent discount at Clarion Hotels. The Metroliner offers express service between New York and Washington. Amtrak's Empire service runs between New York, Albany and Buffalo.
1996-02-18	As Fiery Crash Ended Dreams, Survivors Fled	"About six weeks ago, Thomas Loatman learned that a commuter train could take him home to Washington from his Job Corps training center near Harpers Ferry, W. Va. He told his father about it in a letter. But Bruce Loatman, a computer systems specialist who lives outside Washington in Reston, Va., wrote back to his son, saying: ""Don't take the train. I'll pick you up."""
1996-02-18	February 11-17;Train Crashes in D.C.	A Chicago-bound Amtrak train, the Capitol Limited, collided Friday with a Maryland commuter train just outside Washington, killing at least 11 people. Most of the dead were Job Corps students on their way home for the holiday weekend. More than 20 people were injured. The collision occurred just a week after a New Jersey Transit train collision in the Meadowlands that killed four people, including the engineer John J. DeCurtis. It was revealed last week that he had been suspended a number of times before for passing red signals and who may have had a slight problem distinguishing colors.
1996-02-18	Last Crash Is Fourth This Month	"The crash that killed 11 people here on Friday night was the fourth major train accident so far this month, but Federal officials said today that the accidents appeared to have no common thread. ""We haven't found any common denominator,"" said John Goglia, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, although he stressed that the investigation was just getting under way."
1996-01-28	Power Struggle Stalls Station Plan	"After a joint city-state-federal effort finally won $315 million to remodel the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue into a grand new Pennsylvania Station, the project has stalled in a power struggle over who will run it. The Giuliani administration is demanding that Amtrak remove Amy Linden, 39, as project director, saying she is unfit in light of her troubled tenure as director of city school facilities. Richard J. Schwartz, a senior mayoral adviser, confirming a report in The Daily News, said last week: ""She doesn't appear to be the right person for this job, which requires an individual that has handled projects of this magnitude and complexity and importance."""
1996-01-14	No More Help With Bags At Amtrak's Trenton Station	Baggage service for Amtrak passengers at Trenton ended last week. Amtrak says the elimination of service is an economic necessity, born of a huge cut in its Federal subsidy, from $392 million last year to $185 million this year. Other cuts have been felt as well: cuts in management jobs, delays in computer purchases, delays in graffiti removal, increases in some fares. In Trenton, baggage service was generating only about $4,000 a year in fees -- with each of the station's three handlers toting an average of six bags a day, at a cost of $141,000 a year in salaries and benefits, the company said. The handlers won't be out of a job; each is high on the seniority chain. But three junior employees are out of luck.
1995-12-28	Shore Rail Line To Extend East	Shore Line East, the heavily subsidized commuter train from Old Saybrook, Conn., to New Haven that Gov. John G. Rowland tried to end, will instead be expanded, the state announced today. The line, operated for the state by Amtrak, will be extended to New London as early as Feb. 1. The service links up in New Haven with Metro-North trains to New York.
1995-12-24	Amtrak Adds Services, East and West	Amtrak has added limited-stop service to the schedule of the San Diegan, which runs between Santa Barbara and San Diego. On weekdays the San Diegan Express leaves San Diego at 6:33 A.M. and arrives in Santa Barbara at 11:36 A.M. The southbound trip leaves Santa Barbara at 2:30 P.M. and arrives in San Diego at 7:40 P.M. The express makes 10 other stops between these cities, four fewer than the regular schedule, reducing travel time by up to 50 minutes. Last month weekend service was added on the Atlanta-New Orleans leg of the Crescent train, which operates three times a week between New York and New Orleans.
1995-12-17	5 Bridges At Issue In Amtrak Project	"THE final obstacle facing Amtrak's $1.7 billion electrification and capital improvement project between Boston and Washington, D.C., is Connecticut's approval. 

     Every state the Amtrak corridor passes through has ruled the electrification  project is consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act, except for Connecticut, said David Carol, an Amtrak spokesperson."
1995-12-15	Target of Derailment Raid Cleared by Evidence, His Lawyer Says	"The lawyer for a man whose home here was raided on Wednesday by Federal agents investigating the intentional derailment of an Amtrak train in Arizona said today that the items seized would clear his client. ""John Olin did not commit this act,"" the lawyer, Allan J. Sarkin, said at a news conference."
1995-12-14	Agents Raid a California Home For Clues in Amtrak Sabotage	In the first sign of progress in the inquiry into the sabotage of an Amtrak train in Arizona, Federal agents today raided the California mountain home of a man considered a potential suspect, the authorities said. The search was at the residence of John Ernest Olin, 32, who lives at Val Verde, a remote village 40 miles north of Los Angeles. Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, armed with a sealed search warrant, combed the house for several hours and removed numerous items as possible evidence.
1995-11-27	Amtrak's Uphill Climb	Rail passenger service is the stepchild of America's transportation policy and the automobile culture Congress serves so slavishly. It took decades for urban transit systems to wrest even a penny of the Federal gasoline tax to help localities rationalize the way people get to and from work. Now Amtrak, the intercity people-mover struggling to gain its financial footing, is at the mercy of the highway lobby and their loyal legislators. Congress must provide the financial security Amtrak needs. The passenger company, spun off from railroads that were allowed to concentrate on their viable freight business, deserves a sound financial base from a capital trust fund such as highway construction enjoys. So do rail customers, and so for that matter do motorists who seek open, uncluttered roadways.
1995-11-19	Riding the Rails At What Price?	"AT Pennsylvania Station in New York, Barbara Katende, who works in the Amtrak information booth, was speaking on her microphone to a traveler who wanted to go to Washington. Ms. Katende was marking a card showing the train times. ""Now I am checking the trains where you can get to Washington for only $51,"" she said, ""providing you do not travel on Friday or Sunday between 11 A.M. and 11 P.M. Be very careful which time you pick, because if you take a Metroliner, it can cost you double."""
1995-11-08	Amtrak Is 'Looking' After 23 Years	"Amtrak said yesterday that it was ""looking at the capabilities of other agencies"" for its account, which has been handled for 23 years by DDB Needham New York. The billings were estimated at $40 million. ""I like to keep my hand on the pulse of the agencies in the marketplace,"" Bob Wehrmann, vice president for national marketing and sales at Amtrak in Washington, said in confirming an Adweek report this week of the talks. He praised DDB Needham's work but added, ""I need to know what the other options are."""
1995-11-05	Boxcars on Amtrak?	Besides Pullman coaches and observation cars, Amtrak may soon be able to add baccarat, blackjack and keno cars. The State of Missouri may allow gambling on Amtrak's service between Kansas City and St. Louis. The proposal by Missouri is meant to generate revenue to save the state-subsidized passenger service between the two cities, which are now linked by two trains: the Ann Rutledge and the Missouri Mules. An amendment to the state constitution must be approved by Missouri voters before the dice start rolling down the tracks.
1995-10-16	Eisenhower Was Horrified by Interstates	"To the Editor: Your Oct. 8 Week in Review article on using a portion of gasoline tax revenues to improve Amtrak quotes the House Transportation Committee chairman, Bud Shuster, on ""the first contract with America . . . between Eisenhower and the Congress, and it was, you pay your gasoline tax and we'll use that money to improve the nation's highways and bridges."" The real contract was between Congress and the highway lobby. In 1959, three years after signing the Interstate System of highways into law, Eisenhower saw road construction in Washington and was horrified to learn it was an ""Interstate."" He had envisioned interstates as linking urban areas, not going through them."

1995-10-15	Oct. 8-14: Derailment in the Desert; Train Sabotage: So Simple, Devastating and Deadly	Apparently using little more than a wrench and a red electrical wire, saboteurs last week demonstrated that it does not take much to derail a moving passenger train. As Amtrak's cross-country Sunset Limited approached a bridge in the Arizona desert early Monday, it fell off the track and plunged down a 30-foot-ravine, killing one crew member and injuring 77 other people. Amtrak executives said a joint connecting two lengths of track had been loosened. To conceal the loosened joint, they said, a wire was attached from one length of track to the other so the current would keep flowing and the train's conductor would continue to see a green signal on the side of the track. Experts said the sabotage would require simply a rudimentary knowledge of railroads and take about 10 minutes to accomplish.
1995-10-14	Officials Release Note Found Near Derailed Train	Law-enforcement officials today disclosed the text of a typewritten note found near the Amtrak train that was derailed in the Arizona desert early Monday and said they hoped that someone would recognize something about it and come forward. The note suggests that Federal agents who laid siege to the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., two years ago intentionally spread the fire that ultimately killed more than 80 people there.
1995-10-14	Derailment Letter	Here is the letter left at the scene of the the Amtrak derailment on Monday near Hyder, Ariz., as reported by the Associated Press with the original spelling and grammar preserved Indictment of the ATF and FBI Before dawn the women awoke to say their morning prayers. The women slept upstairs. They lit their kerosene lamps because the electricity had been turned off by the FBI. After observing lights in all the upstairs windows, the FBI ordered the teargas bombardment. Afterwards, only two upstairs windows were lit. The location of each was recorded. Over the next few hours ventilation holes were poked in the walls. These holes made the fire burn very much faster. Otherwise the fire department would have had time to put out the fire before the women and children died in the flames. At noon, the light from the two kerosene lamps was obscured by bright sunlight. Everyone had forgotten about them except the man who carried their locations written on a scrap of paper in his pocket. He ordered the tank drivers where to crash through. Guess under which two windows. He ordered them to raise their guns, as they backed out, the guns were lowered. The video tape shows clearly the floor being raised by the (word unintelligible) a foot and a half. Guess what happened to the kerosene lamps in (word unintelligible) rooms above the tanks. A minute afterwards, black smoke started to pour out of the windows where the lamps had burned. This is the normal time needed for a kerosene fire to build up.
1995-10-12	With No Witnesses in Sight, Investigators Sift Wreckage	With no witnesses coming forward with information about the sabotage of a railroad track in the Arizona desert earlier this week, Federal investigators continued today to focus on gathering physical evidence at the site where the Amtrak train derailed, killing a crew member and injuring 77 other people. This morning the Federal Bureau of Investigation moved a crane to the scene to lift the toppled coaches. Then dozens of Federal agents crawled in the dust looking for the smallest fragment that could provide clues about who sabotaged the track and why.
1995-10-11	F.B.I. Studies Note for Clues On Derailment	Federal authorities investigating the deadly sabotage derailment of an Amtrak train in Arizona said today that they had no suspects or motive, but that a note found at the scene began with a poem about the women who died in the fire that ended the siege of the Branch Davidian sect's compound near Waco, Tex. As Federal investigators scoured the remote desert site where several passenger cars of Amtrak's Sunset Limited tumbled off a Southern Pacific trestle early Monday, killing a crewman and injuring dozens of people, specialists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington began studying the note for clues.
1995-10-10	Sabotage Derails Arizona Train; One Is Killed and 100 Are Hurt	A stretch of track through a remote expanse of desert was sabotaged, causing an Amtrak train carrying 268 people to derail early today as it passed over a trestle spanning a gulch, the authorities said. One crew member was killed and about 100 people were injured, but most injuries were not believed to be serious, officials said.
1995-09-30	Why Should Those Who Drive Pay for Others to Ride Trains?	To the Editor: Re your Sept. 23 letters on Amtrak and the highways: Who should pay the costs to run a railroad? The trust funds in the highway and airline industries are paid for by individuals who choose to drive or fly. The Amtrak trust fund, as proposed by Amtrak, would not come from rail users, but directly from the pockets of people who use highways.
1995-09-23	Americans Would Never Trade Cars for Trains; On the Fast Track	To the Editor: You're on the right track when you suggest that an investment in Amtrak is in the national interest (editorial, Sept. 16). If proof of the efficiency of rail service is needed, one need only look at two of our greatest economic competitors, Germany and Japan, where fast, dependable trains are an integral part of the economy and are taken for granted.
1995-09-23	Washerwoman Travels First Class	Oseola McCarty did not ask for anything when she donated her life savings of $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi for black scholarship students. But when the White House invited the 87-year-old washerwoman to join President Clinton at a dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday night, she needed something simple: a train ticket for the 24-hour journey from Hattiesburg, Miss., to Washington.
1995-09-23	Americans Would Never Trade Cars for Trains; Safer Than Highways	"To the Editor: Far more should be said about the demise of Amtrak's Broadway limited run to Chicago on Sept. 9, and many other passenger train routes, with more ""deaths"" to come."
1995-09-23	Americans Would Never Trade Cars for Trains	"To the Editor: ""A Future for Amtrak"" (editorial, Sept. 16) urges Congress to support a permanent Amtrak trust fund to save intercity rail passenger service from oblivion. To its credit, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, under the able chairmanship of Bud Shuster, is balking."
1995-09-18	Yes, Give Amtrak a Share of Gasoline Tax	To the Editor: Your Sept. 13 news article raises a point bigger than just Amtrak and the demise of a national passenger rail service. Amtrak wants half of one cent of the Federal gasoline tax in exchange for giving up Federal operating subsidies.
1995-09-16	A Future for Amtrak	To save intercity rail passenger service from ruin, Amtrak has been running trains less often and discontinuing others entirely, hoping to fashion a lean but viable system. Now to safeguard its future and secure a reliable source of funding for capital projects, the railroad seeks a permanent trust fund, similar to those in the highway and airline industries. Congress should support the plan. The benefits of passenger rail service cannot be measured solely in terms of commercial profit and loss. It provides a form of transportation valued by millions of Americans and produces reduced highway and airport congestion and cleaner air, amply justifying some public expense.
1995-09-13	Amtrak Seeks Fuel Tax Share To End Subsidy	Amtrak could soon manage without operating subsidies, as Republicans in Congress have insisted, if it could permanently keep a half cent of the Federal gasoline tax for its capital budget, its president promised today. But the struggling passenger railroad's goal runs directly counter to the plan of the House committee with jurisdiction over Amtrak, where the chairman wants to take the gasoline tax off the budget entirely, so it can be used solely for roads and not be hoarded to make the Federal deficit look smaller. In addition, transit systems fear that the half cent could come out of their penny-a-gallon share of the 18-cent-a-gallon tax.
1995-09-03	Amtrak Keeps Service From D.C. to Chicago	Amtrak's Cardinal train will maintain service three times a week between Washington, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Chicago, with upgraded double-decker Superliner equipment to be introduced on Sept. 10. Currently, the Cardinal originates in New York, but connecting service to Washington will be available as of Sept. 10. The route was originally scheduled to be truncated to a Washington, D.C.-Cincinnati route, as part of the cuts announced last April. Instead, the Cincinnati-to-Chicago service will be maintained, but the Hoosier State train, now running between Indianapolis and Chicago, will be eliminated as of Sept. 10, replaced by the Cardinal.
1995-08-17	Amtrak Faces Cuts It May Not Survive	To the Editor: Thank you for including in your Aug. 11 article on the Senate-passed 1996 transportation appropriations bill that Amtrak -- as well as mass transit -- was cut significantly.
1995-08-11	Senate Votes to Cut $1.6 Billion in Transportation Programs	The Senate today approved a $12.6 billion appropriations bill for the Department of Transportation that makes steep cuts in Federal spending on roads, mass transit, airports and the Amtrak rail system. Democrats attacked the plan as foolhardy but in the end joined the Republican majority in adopting the measure 98 to 1.
1995-06-11	Amtrak Resumes Seattle-Vancouver Run	After a hiatus of 14 years, Amtrak has resumed passenger service between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. The service last operated in the fall of 1981. Spanish-built Talgo equipment will be used on the 144-mile run, with one round trip a day. The train, the Mount Baker International, will leave Seattle at 7:15 A.M. and arrive in Vancouver at 11:50 A.M.; it will leave Vancouver at 6 P.M. and arrive in Seattle at 10:35 P.M.
1995-05-19	Amtrak to Pay $4.5 Million	Amtrak must pay $4.5 million to the family of a man left comatose when he was hit by a train in 1990. Edwin Ocasio, now 34, was trying to cross the elevated tracks at the abandoned South Street station in Newark when a New Jersey Transit train struck him. An Essex County jury found Wednesday that Amtrak, which owns the tracks, should have fenced them off.
1995-05-18	Transportation Chief Warns Against Transit Subsidy Cuts	"Republican budget proposals would slowly cripple mass transit in and around New York by slashing money for maintenance and modernization, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said yesterday. The resolutions passed last week by the House and Senate Budget Committees, which would cut spending on transportation by 13 to 22 percent over five years, reflect ""a Republican philosophy of saying that transit is not important to our country,"" Mr. Pena said in an interview."
1995-05-14	Praising Amtrak	To the Editor: Although I realize that Amtrak-baiting is a cherished pastime, I would nonetheless like to react to some letters in your news paper. Unfortunate experiences do happen, but don't they happen on airlines too? I've often waited 30 to 45 minutes for a two- to three-hour flight to leave. As a percentage of total travel time, Amtrak's performance over journeys of 24 hours and longer is less horrific. Neither do airlines necessarily take the trouble to explain what is going on.
1995-05-11	Amtrak's Plan to Electrify Line Clears Final Hurdle	Amtrak's plan to convert the line between New Haven and Boston to electric power cleared its final procedural hurdle before the Federal Government on Tuesday, moving a decades-old vision of trains speeding from Boston to New York in under three hours closer to reality. The Federal Railroad Administration, completing a three-and-a-half-year environmental review, approved the $1.7 billion electrification effort, which calls for trains faster than any now in use in the United States to be traveling the corridor from Washington to Boston by 1999. Proponents envision a project that would put rail service in the Northeast on a par with the best of Europe and Japan, spawn a new domestic industry in high-speed train building, create thousands of jobs and cut pollution by reducing reliance on cars and airplanes.
1995-05-08	Shuttles in Northeast Keep Fares Up and Thrive	America's two coasts have always seemed like worlds apart. Their air shuttles make it more so. On the West Coast, the United Airlines unit of the UAL Corporation and Southwest Airlines are fighting it out with $69 fares for so-called walk-up passengers who want to fly between Los Angeles and Oakland, a distance of more than 300 miles. Even after a $10 increase last month, the price of a one-way shuttle ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco is $99.
1995-04-30	In Amtrak Cutbacks, Even Legends Suffer	"Amtrak is fulfilling the words of Steve Goodman's song ""The City of New Orleans"": ""This train's got the disappearing railroad blues."" On June 11, the City of New Orleans train will no longer make a daily trip between Chicago and New Orleans, but will start skipping Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Then, beginning Sept. 10, the Broadway Limited, the overnight express between New York and Chicago, will operate only between New York and Pittsburgh; passengers traveling between Chicago and Pittsburgh will use the Capitol Limited. The California Zephyr between Salt Lake City and Oakland, Calif., will not run on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays beginning June 11. What's left of the Hiawatha, now running just between Chicago and Milwaukee, a fragment of the former Chicago-Minneapolis trip, now operates four times a day, instead of seven. BETSY WADE"
1995-04-09	Amtrak's Broadway Limited Is to Become Literally That	No. 29, the railroaders called it. The big train, the fastest train, hauled by a 480,000-pound, 4,620-horsepower, 20-wheel locomotive striped with real gold leaf. It rumbled out of Pennsylvania Station at 6 P.M. and into the night at speeds as high as 100 miles an hour, down through North Philadelphia, along the Main Line, through Paoli and Lancaster and Harrisburg and through the Alleghenies to Pittsburgh, then west for 907 miles to a rendezvous with Chicago at 9 A.M. It was the pride of the Pennsylvania Railroad: the Broadway Limited.
1995-04-09	Last (Amtrak) Train Out of Town	"AMTRAK and the Atlantic County Improvement Authority spent millions of dollars a decade ago so that people like Robert and Patricia Heusel, schoolteachers from Hot Springs, Ark., could take a train to Atlantic City. The Heusels didn't want to spend last Saturday in Washington, where they were on vacation. It was April Fool's Day, and they wanted to dosomething foolish. They impulsively spent $102 for a pair of round-trip Amtrak tickets for their first trip to the Boardwalk -- which was also their first train ride. They boarded the 9 A.M. at Union Station. They arrived in Atlantic City at 12:25 P.M. and took a bus to a casino, the Sands, where they were given $10 in coins. Not only did they win back the cost of the trip when they got lucky on the slot machines; they witnessed the end of an era. Along with 101 other passengers that night, the Heusels were on the last Amtrak run out of Atlantic City. After the 10:15 rumbled out of the rail terminal, Amtrak closed its ticket office and removed just about everything but the tracks, hoping to shave $4.6 million from its budget. The end of Amtrak's six-year run did not mean the end of rail transportation to Atlantic City, which is still provided by New Jersey Transit. But for people like the Heusels, going to Atlantic City by train would no longer be an effortless caprice. They would have to want to go badly enough to travel first to Philadelphia's 30th Street Station and leave the comparatively luxurious Amtrak coaches, with their burgundy reclining seats, convivial cafe cars and easy-to-find restrooms, for a New Jersey Transit train that makes a half-dozen stops each way; has no reclining seats, running water or food car, and doesn't get you free coins from casinos. (The New Jersey Transit fare is lower: $6 each way on the Philadelphia-Atlantic City run, compared with $9 on Amtrak.) ""It's really too bad,"" Mr. Heusel said, getting coffee in the cafe car. ""I could really get to like this."" On the platform, Richard Del Bono, the engineer on the 10:15, solemnly embraced saddened Amtrak employees. ""This is an emotional moment,"" he said. ""I ran the first train down here in 1989, and now I'm riding the last one out."" Though Amtrak's era in Atlantic City is hardly long enough to be called an era, the railroad era is something else. The city's initial prosperity was based on the ease with which day-trippers from Philadelphia and New York could board a train and, within a few hours, inhale the salt breeze. A railroad conductor, Alexander Boardman, invented the city's Boardwalk. In the 1930's, the city had two train terminals, one at South Carolina Avenue, the other at what has become the bus terminal, at Missouri and Arctic Avenues. The railroads left Atlantic City in 1982, victims of the automobile and the casino bus. But when bus-exhaust pollution levels began to rival those at the Lincoln Tunnel, the county improvement authority spent $20 million for a new terminal to adjoin a new convention center (now under construction and scheduled to open in 1996). Amtrak paid for repairs and track improvements; the state built or restored stations along the line. Amtrak and the casino industry had high hopes for the train. Amtrak added a first-class club car and encouraged chartered junkets for high rollers. Some casinos offered coin refunds to passengers. And New Jersey Transit began commuter service for casino employees. But Amtrak never quite got enough warm bodies. For last few years, its trains were rarely more than half full. ""It meant a lot to some people,"" said the conductor on the 10:15, Earl Davisson, who, instead of punching tickets, was autographing them. ""We had our regulars we'd see every week. There was a group up in Connecticut that would charter a whole car once or twice a year. We had birthday parties all the time. ""Now I hear we might be back when they get the convention center open. But then again we might not. Nobody thought we'd be back when they stopped in '82, but here we are. Or were."" He signed a ticket. ""Nothing's forever."""
1995-03-26	States Trying to Save Routes Cut by Amtrak	Since Amtrak's announcement of service cuts in December, several states have been negotiating with the railroad to use state and local money and save some of the routes that were originally targeted for elimination. While the Montrealer train from New York to Montreal via Vermont will stop operating next month, a new service, the Vermonter, is scheduled to offer daily service between Washington and St. Albans, Vt., with bus service to Montreal.
1995-03-24	Trying to Keep Trains Rolling	More than half the people who ride trains each day between here and Philadelphia are coming to work or play in this city's casinos. And although the casinos won't provide subsidies to keep the unprofitable line running, Nicholas Amato, head of the Casino Association of New Jersey, said his group might be interested in helping New Jersey Transit promote the 67-mile line. New Jersey Transit is trying to figure out whether it wants to keep the line running once Amtrak stops helping out in April.
1995-03-02	New Jersey Daily Briefing; N.J. Considers Gamblers' Train	"One month from today, Amtrak will cancel its ""Gambler's Express"" service between Philadelphia and Atlantic City. New Jersey Transit agreed on Tuesday to decide soon whether to pick up that service."
1995-02-26	Luggage Problems	To the Editor: I had an unfortunate experience using the kind of luggage carts often rented in airports and railroad terminals. I have always looked on these carts as a boon, since it is often difficult and always expensive to get a porter, and the carts provide an inexpensive way of handling several heavy bags.
1995-02-22	Amtrak Is Ordered Not to Eject The Homeless From Penn Station	"Saying she would not join in ""labeling of the homeless as a criminal class,"" a Federal judge ordered Amtrak yesterday to stop ejecting people from Pennsylvania Station simply because they are homeless. The advocates for the homeless who sued Amtrak said the judge's ruling, which called Penn Station a public place where loitering could not be prohibited, applied equally to any site, whether a train station or a shopping mall, that provided almost unlimited public access."
1995-02-22	Amtrak Can Be Sued on Poster, Court Rules	Handing at least a temporary victory to a New York City artist who wants to put up a huge political poster in Pennsylvania Station, the Supreme Court ruled today that Amtrak is an agency of the Federal Government and that as such, it is bound by the Constitution to respect individual rights like the right of free speech. The 8-to-1 decision overturned a ruling in 1993 by the Federal appeals court in Manhattan that held that Amtrak, which owns Penn Station, is a private corporation to which the Constitution's limits do not apply.
1995-02-07	Despite Route Cuts, Amtrak's Deep Financial Woes Continue	"Amtrak is in deep financial trouble despite the decision by its management in December to slash many long-distance routes, the General Accounting Office said yesterday, adding that the railroad would continue to deteriorate unless there were even bigger cuts or much bigger subsidies. Congress should reconsider ""whether Amtrak's original mission of providing nationwide intercity passenger rail service at the present level is still appropriate,"" the auditors said."
1995-02-05	A Touch of Class	For rail enthusiasts who long for glamour -- and can pay handsomely for it -- Abercrombie & Kent has added a new car, the City of Angels, to its fleet. With five double bedrooms and a dining room lighted by a crystal chandelier, the car can carry 10 overnight guests to any destination served by Amtrak in the United States or Canada. With a chef, a steward and a concierge, passengers can roam the car, built in the style of a 1928 luxury coach. Packages include an eight-day jaunt from Chicago through Glacier National Park to Seattle for $4,495 a person for eight. (800) 323-7308.
1995-02-05	Further Thoughts On Amtrak	"Your article (""As Deadline Nears, Amtrak Project Raises Questions,"" Jan. 22) needs further exploration. The proposed shoreline route needs major, costly reconstruction to accommodate the proposed high-speed electric equipment. Even with our present outdated equipment, there are numerous curves that now require trains to slow to a crawl."
1995-01-29	By Amtrak	"To the Editor: Cheryl Zoldowski's article ""Crisscrossing the Country Aboard Amtrak"" (Nov. 6) was a welcome neutrally reported article, considering the general treatment Amtrak receives. As a frequent traveler aboard Amtrak, I would like to add a couple of things. Amtrak's beautiful television advertisements and travel planner may lead the public to expect a level of luxury that does not exist. Travelers should plan on an experience closer to camping than a cruise. That is not to say the experience is without merit. The train shows you the detail of American life in a way no other transportation mode can."
1995-01-29	More Changes Made In Amtrak's Schedule	Following its December announcement of schedule cuts, Amtrak has further modified its service effective Feb. 1. The daily Palmetto train between New York and Tampa, Fla., will be discontinued. The schedules of two daily train services -- the Crescent, which runs between New York and New Orleans, and the Gulf Breeze, operating between Birmingham and Mobile, Ala. -- will be changed to three times a week.
1995-01-29	By Amtrak	To the Editor: A friend and I planned to take Amtrak's Empire Builder from Portland, Ore., to Chicago and then the Broadway Limited from Chicago to Trenton. There would be an almost five-hour wait between trains. We reserved, in each train, a small compartment with its own toilet facilities, which gave us the privilege of prepaying for three meals a day. We were an hour late leaving Portland, waiting for the connecting train from California. We settled back, finally, to enjoy the scenery, which was spectacular. Dinner time approached and we were informed that the kitchen was not in operation and passengers would have a choice of two packaged meals.

Electrifying the corridor is expected to cut the trip from New York to Boston to about three hours from four, more than double the number of trains on the route and increase the number of people using the railroad to as many as 3.6 million a year according to the Federal environmental study."
1995-01-15	Getting Our Train To Run on Time	The train glides out of a curve and accelerates so smoothly that the teacup on the cherry-wood table in front of you barely rattles. The seat is so soft it makes a Lexus feel like a Jeep bouncing along a gully. There's nothing to do but stare out the spotless picture window at a long cornfield bobbing in a slow breeze. . . . Same route, different ride. Ducking between two elderly ladies holding each other to keep from falling, their arms shaking slightly as they grab for luggage racks that have no handholds, you hunch over and squint through a tiny, smeared, dark brown lozenge of a window for some idea of where you are. Is that a cornfield or a parking lot?
1995-01-01	Amtrak Cuts Service On Many Long Routes	Traveling by rail has always meant checking what time of day the train runs, but beginning Feb. 1, on most long Amtrak routes it will also mean checking what day the train runs: Five major trains will be cut to three or four times a week, instead of daily. In addition, 10 routes that once operated as extensions of major trains -- with cars that linked up to a cross-country train, or peeled off to take a spur line -- will be eliminated on April 1; so will three short routes. And that is just the first round. Amtrak, which announced the cuts on Dec. 14, plans more of them next year.
1994-12-18	Dec. 11-17; Rail Routes Written on the Wind	Hiawatha will no longer roam the land, the Silver Meteor and Silver Star will grow rare, the Desert Wind will blow less often and the romance of the rails will diminish, as Amtrak shrinks itself drastically early next year to trim expenses to fit revenues. Cuts announced last week amount to more than 20 percent of the train miles, and concentrate heavily on long-distance routes. The Empire Builder -- perhaps the last non-pejorative use of the word empire -- will run between Chicago and Portland only four times a week in most of its route. The Hiawatha, 13 trips a day from Chicago to Milwaukee, will cease altogether. The Montrealer from Washington through New York to Montreal will end in New York.
1994-12-15	AMTRAK PLANNING SHARP CUTBACKS	"Amtrak said yesterday that it would cut more than a fifth of the miles it travels early next year, eliminating some rail passenger routes altogether and laying off about 5,500 workers. The plan will reduce the frequency of trains in the heavily traveled corridor from Washington through New York City to Boston, and end the service from New York through Vermont to Montreal and from Atlantic City to Philadelphia. The goal is to eliminate an annual deficit of nearly $200 million by September 1995, and the cuts, the biggest since Congress created the railroad in 1971, are only the first round. The railroad's board said it will consider more in March 1995. By next September, ""virtually all long-distance Amtrak trains will be less than daily,"" said a railroad spokesman, Clifford Black."
1994-12-13	Amtrak to Consider Major Cuts in Service to Make Up Its Deficit	Hurt by airline fare wars, accidents and rising costs, Amtrak is considering major cuts in service, the first since the early 1980's. The railroad's board will meet today to consider how to make up a deficit projected at $200 million for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.
1994-12-11	Amtrak's Empty Promises	"To the Editor: Regarding ""Fiat Hopes to Put a Tilt Into Amtrak's Trains"" (Technology, Nov. 13), the idea of introducing tilting trains, which should reduce travel time between New York and Boston to less than three hours, has been around for some time. I have lost track, however, of how long I have been reading about improved service in this corridor. What I find amusing is that before Amtrak, there was excellent service from Grand Central Terminal to Bostonon the Advance Merchants Limited, which made the trip in 3 hours and 55 minutes. When Amtrak moved all Boston departures to Pennsylvania Station to connect with arrivals from Washington and the South, it added an hour to the trip because of the circuitous route through Queens that trains must take to get under way. Is this progress? EGON PARKS Manhattan, Nov. 13"
1994-11-13	Technology; Fiat Hopes to Put a Tilt Into Amtrak's Trains	ADVANCED railroad technology pioneered in Europe by the Italian auto maker Fiat may soon make it much faster and more comfortable for travelers in the northeastern United States to get from one big city to another. Fiat, based here, intends to bid on a $600 million contract to provide tilting trains to Amtrak in the United States. It developed the system for such trains in the late 1960's and has delivered roughly 70 percent of those now operating worldwide.
1994-11-08	High Court Hears Case on Amtrak Rejection of Penn Station Ad	There was no dispute in a Supreme Court argument today that the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, usually known as Amtrak, was created by the Federal Government, kept financially afloat by the Federal Government and is run by a board whose members, including the Secretary of Transportation, are appointed by the President. Nor was there any disagreement about the Government's ownership of all of Amtrak's preferred stock and the mortgages on the railroad's major properties, including Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.
1994-11-06	Connecticut Q&A: David J. Carol; Adding More (and Faster) Rail Service	AMTRAK'S vice president for high-speed rail, David J. Carol, is charged with overseeing a $3 billion, 16-year improvement project for the 231-mile stretch of railroad that makes up the Northeast corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. The Northeast corridor is one of the busiest in the Amtrak system, with 1,150 trains a day carrying 220 million passengers a year.

1994-09-30	Signal Work At Station Will Disrupt Rail Service	Service on Amtrak, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit will be disrupted on Saturday and on Sunday while Pennsylvania Station in New York switches to a more modern control system. Construction officials promise that the station will be back to normal by Monday morning.
1994-09-12	A Blaze in Penn Station Disrupts Train Schedules	A fire under the diesel locomotive of an empty Amtrak passenger train yesterday morning forced the evacuation of Penn Station, disrupted rail and subway service for several hours and sent plumes of smoke billowing through the station and onto Seventh Avenue. Fire officials complained of being delayed for nearly an hour and a half in putting out the fire because they could not get confirmation from Amtrak officials that electric power to the area had been shut off so they could douse the blaze. The fire, which was first noticed at 9:42 A.M., went to four alarms but was declared under control at 12:40 P.M., about an hour after firefighters were convinced that power had been shut off and they were in no danger of electrocution.
1994-09-11	Superliners in the East	Amtrak's Capitol Limited, the overnight train between the District of Columbia and Chicago, gets a dash of glamour on Oct. 30, when double-decker Superliner cars are added to the service. Though in use for more than a decade on runs west of the Mississippi, the two-story cars, with a circular staircase connecting the two decks, are new to Eastern routes. The new service also features a lounge, sleeping cars and a dining car, with food prepared by graduates of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. Sleeping cars range from economy rooms ($116 for two adults, one way) to larger deluxe rooms outfitted with toilets and showers ($231 for two, one way). Room accommodations include breakfast and dinner as well as wake-up service with newspaper, coffee and orange juice. A round-trip fare between Washington and Chicago costs $128, sleeping accommodations extra. To reserve, call (800) 872-7245.
1994-08-10	Crew Members of Derailed Train Were Sober, Investigators Say	The engineer of an Amtrak passenger train that derailed last week near Batavia, N.Y., was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs when the last nine cars of the train rocked off the tracks and plunged down an embankment, Federal investigators said yesterday. The mystery surrounding the derailment grew murkier yesterday, as toxicology tests showed that the engineer, the conductor and three assistant conductors were all sober. Moreover, an extensive mechanical inspection of a set of wheels believed to be the first to derail revealed no flaws that would explain the cause of the wreck, Federal officials said.
1994-08-07	July 31-Aug. 6: Pre-Dawn Derailment; Questioning Rail Safety After an Amtrak Wreck	"The Clinton Administration is planning an inquiry into the safety of the country's passenger railroads after Amtrak's South Shore Limited derailed in Batavia, N.Y., last week, sending nine cars and 320 sleepy passengers plunging down a rock embankment and into a wooded gully at 3:44 A.M. No one was killed, but scores suffered broken bones and other injuries. The wreck of the Chicago-bound train on a straight high-grade track owned by Conrail was the eighth derailment for Amtrak in the last two years. The worst, last September in Alabama, left 47 people dead. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena ordered a ""summit conference"" on rail safety, to focus particularly on why there are so many collisions at grade crossings."
1994-08-04	Train Derails Near Buffalo, Hurting Scores	A Chicago-bound Amtrak passenger train derailed in this rural town early today, sending nine cars hurtling down an embankment into pitch-black chaos. At least 92 people were injured, many after being jolted from their sleep and thrown about the topsy-turvy cabins like rag dolls. At least 29 people were hospitalized. Genesee County officials said one woman was critically injured, but apparently no one was killed, and officials called that extremely lucky.
1994-07-03	'Watchers' Keep Eye on the Police	About 80 people sat in the Amtrak waiting room at Penn Station near midnight on Tuesday. Most chatted quietly, read, stared into space or dozed. One man nodded off with a cold pizza slice draped across his lap. There appeared nothing unusual about the group, except for a small, white-haired woman who angrily wagged her finger and jabbered into the air. But at least half the people were homeless and not waiting for trains -- at least according to advocates for the homeless who send three or four volunteer observers there every night.
1994-06-22	Barge Pilot Blamed in Fatal Amtrak Wreck	Federal officials today blamed a poorly trained barge pilot for the worst train wreck in Amtrak's history, saying he rammed a train bridge in a pre-dawn fog moments before the 11-car Sunset Limited, en route from Los Angeles to Miami, began to cross the span. Investigators said the pilot, Willie Odom, could not read his radar, had left his chart of the river at home and did not have a compass. Like many towboat operators in the area, they said, he had no formal training. They said he had received his piloting license only months before, after failing the exam seven times.
1994-06-03	Computer to Aid Penn Station Trains	Like planes in an airport approach pattern, the 1,000 trains arriving at Pennsylvania Station every day must line up for scarce slots in the tunnels and wait their turn to enter. If one train is a minute late, then the 15 or 20 trains behind it are also a minute late, at the very least. Then, Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road blame each other for delays.
1994-05-29	Proposal to Move Amtrak Would Be User Unfriendly	"To the Editor: In regard to the May 1 article, ""Grand New Amtrak Terminal: Arriving, the First $10 Million,"" while from a visual angle the $315 million project to relocate Amtrak's trains from its present Penn Station to a new one at the old Post Office looks like a grand idea, from a users' perspective the proposal is a disaster."

1994-05-24	High Court to Rule on Amtrak Ban on Political Sign	Accepting an appeal from an East Village artist who tried to rent a billboard in Pennsylvania Station for his political art, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether Amtrak can exclude particular political messages from its train stations. The Justices will decide whether Amtrak is a private corporation that is not bound by the Constitution, as a Federal appeals court ruled in dismissing the artist's suit five months ago, or whether it functions as a Government entity that must abide by the First Amendment, as a Federal District Judge initially held.
1994-05-18	Earlier Mishap Reported at Site Of Derailment	The investigation into the derailment of an Amtrak passenger train that apparently struck a dislodged trailer jutting from a passing freight train turned today to reports that the same freight line had recently had a similar but less serious accident. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were said to have heard reports of such an incident while combing the scene of the derailment here on Monday.
1994-05-17	Derailment Injures 97 And Kills 1	"Amtrak's Silver Meteor passenger train, bound from New York to Florida, derailed here early today after hitting a cargo container jutting out from a passing freight, officials said. The Amtrak engineer was killed and nearly 100 passengers were injured. Jerry R. Davis, executive vice president and chief operations officer of CSX Transportation, which operated the freight train, said, ""Apparently a trailer was loose and sitting cockeyed on the car and got sideswiped by the Amtrak train."""
1994-05-01	Grand New Amtrak Terminal: Arriving, the First $10 Million	"In the two years since Amtrak unveiled plans to turn the General Post Office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue into a grand new railroad terminal that evokes the classic elegance of the original Pennsylvania Station, one crucial question has remained: Where will the $315 million necessary to fulfill the plan come from? Last week, the first drop fell in the bucket, when Amtrak's directors approved $9 million for designs and engineering studies and $1 million for historic research and environmental assessment. The Clinton Administration included $90 million for the station in the 1995 budget proposal presented to Congress. By the end of May, a ""memorandum of understanding"" on how to fill the rest of the bucket is expected to be reached among Amtrak, the Federal Department of Transportation, and New York City and State, said Francis C. Marino, a spokesman for the developer, Pennsyvlania Station Associates."
1994-04-24	Amtrak to Widen Ban On Smoking in Trains	On May 1, Amtrak will ban smoking on its short- and medium-distance daytime trains and some long-distance overnight trains. The corporation says that this step will make 82 percent of its trains nonsmoking. The new policy covers all regular trains in the Boston-Washington corridor -- the Met roliners were already nonsmoking -- and all trains into and out of Canada.
1994-04-16	Trains Collide At Low Speed, With 15 Hurt	A New Haven-bound commuter train with 19 passengers aboard went through a stop signal this morning and struck an oncoming commuter train in Old Saybrook, Amtrak officials said. Fifteen passengers and crew members suffered minor injuries in the crash. Amtrak officials said a more serious accident was averted because both the commuter trains had slowed to about 10 miles per hour before the collision. No cars derailed in the accident, which occurred at 6:51 A.M.
1994-04-10	In the Region/Westchester; Amtrak's Reprieve for Downtown New Rochelle	NEW ROCHELLE has received a welcome boost from a decision by Amtrak to continue to use the city's downtown train station and invest $92 million in track, platform and station renovations. The railroad had been considering building a station elsewhere in the city but eventually yielded to community opposition to its abandoning the downtown.
1994-03-28	Fleeing the World Underneath	Homeless, stoned and dirty, Bob Kalinski hit bottom in 1986. Then he went deeper, into the dark. For eight years he lived underground in a train tunnel, safely away from the lights of Manhattan that bored straight through his closed eyelids. He came out only in the early morning when most of the city was asleep, to pick up aluminum cans to sell for food. Then he would scurry back into his hole.
1994-02-04	The Garden State's Iron Horse of Politics Rolls Again	The Mayor of Jersey City is here because he faces a tough fight over revamping his schools. The Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly is here because he is running for the United States Senate. The junior Senator from New Jersey will show up later, because it is his seat the Speaker wants. The head of marketing for Ireland Coffee Company of Pleasantville is here because, well, because everyone else is. Once a year at this time, New Jersey's political and business elite crowd onto a chartered Amtrak train and spend five hours in a blizzard of business cards and campaign literature, clogging the aisles, laughing too loud and spilling beer and diet drinks on one another. A Chamber Salute Officially billed as the annual New Jersey Chamber of Commerce salute to the Garden State's Congressional delegation, the trip has evolved during its 55 years into the longest-rolling influence-peddling, electioneering and networking caravan in the state's history.
1994-01-08	Amtrak Shows Gains, but Needs Help	To the Editor: Your Dec. 26 report that Amtrak is pressing for funds to buy cars and equipment is too bleak.
1993-12-29	U.S. Court Says Amtrak Isn't Obliged To Show Art	A Federal appeals court ruled yesterday that Amtrak could not be forced to display a photo montage in Pennsylvania Station that criticizes a beer company's support for conservative causes. In a 2-1 decision, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a lower court ruling that ordered Amtrak to accommodate a Manhattan artist who wanted to rent billboard space in the station to display the panoramic artwork. The appellate court held that Amtrak is a private rather than governmental entity and thus is not subject to First Amendment strictures that bar the Government from limiting free speech.
1993-12-26	AMTRAK PRESSING FOR CAPITAL FUNDS	Although Amtrak is approaching self-sufficiency in its operating budget, the Government-owned railroad needs a substantial infusion of Federal money to replace dilapidated equipment and property, Federal and Amtrak officials say. Fares paid 80 percent of the railroad's operating costs in 1993, continuing a steady increase from the 48 percent they contributed in 1981. The officials say the railroad could be self-sufficient in the next decade.
1993-12-16	WITNESSES RECALL CHAOS OF CRASH	"The captain and pilot of a Mobile River towboat today described a night of confusion and horror in which they slowly realized that their vessel, lost in the darkness and fog, was involved in a terrible train wreck, one that ultimately killed 47 people. They said finally realized that a ""bump"" they had felt earlier had been their barge hitting a bridge. The impact pushed the railroad tracks on that bridge out of alignment and caused the Amtrak train, the Sunset Limited, to plunge into the Big Bayou Canot in the early morning of Sept. 22."
1993-12-14	3 Heroes Recall Amtrak Disaster on a Bayou	Three men whose heroism was credited with saving scores of lives in the worst wreck in Amtrak's 22-year history vividly recounted today the chaos in which 47 people died when their train plunged into an Alabama bayou this fall. They told a National Transportation Safety Board hearing here of calming hysterical passengers on the Sunset Limited, hoisting them through windows and fishing them out of the Big Bayou Canot. Their accounts were confirmed by Federal officials who had investigated the Sept. 22 tragedy and marveled at how ordinary people took extraordinary risks to save others.
1993-12-12	U.S. Sets Stricter Rules on Towboats and Rails	Acting even before the start of Federal hearings on the worst train wreck in Amtrak's history, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena has announced plans to tighten licensing rules for towboat operators, improve inspections of railroad bridges and require more navigation equipment on towboats. The Amtrak accident, in which 47 people were killed, occurred early on the morning of Sept. 22, about five minutes after a towboat pilot, lost in a predawn fog in an Alabama bayou, rammed a railroad bridge. Preliminary reports indicate that the crash pushed the tracks out of alignment, and when Amtrak's Sunset Limited reached the damaged span, it plunged off the bridge and into Big Bayou Canot near Mobile.
1993-11-28	Shopping at Amtrak In Northeast Corridor	Passengers riding the train along Amtrak's Northeast corridor can shop for everything from televisions to clothing during their trip, as part of a trial service that started last month and will be offered until Jan. 31. After browsing through a 118-page catalogue in the magazine pocket of their seats, passengers can use an on-board telephone to place toll-free orders with Skymall, a company that has been selling merchandise in catalogues on airliners since 1990. The mail-order service is offered on Amtrak's Metroliner Service, between Washington and New York, and on the New England Express, which runs between New York and Boston.
1993-11-27	Don't Hitch Faster Train Service to Fantasies	To the Editor: Your report of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's call for a high-speed rail link using magnetic levitation between New York City and Albany illustrates the appeal of high-tech, high-budget projects to politicians, particularly if they involve large Federal research grants to local constituents (news article, Nov. 10).
1993-11-21	On Amtrak	"To the Editor: A letter by Howard Stoller that appeared Oct. 17 (""Buses on a Roll"") extolled the virtues of bus travel over train travel, mainly because he felt Amtrak employees were rude, the trains were not cleaned and no-smoking rules not enforced. We must write to say that over the last several years we have taken more than a dozen trips on Amtrak and have found the employees polite and helpful, the trains more than reasonably clean and smoking rules well enforced. These trips have ranged from trips on corridors in the New York area to a number of long trips on overnight coaches. Amtrak does a good job and we wish to commend them.

1993-11-14	Amtrak Trims Runs And Closes Offices	In a move to save $10 million a year, Amtrak has reduced rail service throughout the United States. Early this month the frequency of the Pioneer between Denver and Seattle and the Texas Eagle between St. Louis and San Antonio and Houston was cut back from daily to three times a week. The River Cities train between St. Louis and Carbondale, Ill., was discontinued and replaced by a bus that takes passengers to Centralia, Ill. There they can connect with the City of New Orleans, which continues to run daily between Chicago and New Orleans by way of Memphis. Ticket offices have been closed at stations in Delray Beach, Fla.; Pocatello, Idaho; Centralia, Chillicothe and Mattoon, Ill.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Hattiesburg and McComb, Miss.; Malta, Mont.; Southern Pines, N.C.; Devils Lake, N.D.; Amsterdam, N.Y.; Youngstown, Ohio; Temple, Tex., and Cheyenne, Wyo. Trains are continuing to stop at the stations, but passengers planning to board at stations with no ticket offices must buy tickets elsewhere, either at other Amtrak stations or offices or from travel agents.
1993-10-29	Man and Girl Are Killed by Amtrak Train	A man and a 3-year-old girl were hit and killed by an Amtrak train yesterday in Elizabeth, N.J., in what appeared to be a suicide by the man, the police said. The man was seen sitting on the track by the engineer of the approaching train, who was unable to stop the train before it struck the man about 6:45 P.M., said Detective Derek Glenn of the Newark Police Department. The engineer did not see the girl, Detective Glenn said, but her body was found next to the man's, beside the track.
1993-10-28	Clinton for New Station	President Clinton is to announce today that he supports a proposal to transform the General Post Office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue into a new Amtrak railroad hub for New York City, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said last night. The President's announcement, scheduled to be made while he is campaigning with Mayor David N. Dinkins, will mark a milestone in the effort by Amtrak and its supporters, including Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Dinkins, to create a new intercity station intended to recapture the grandeur of the old Pennsylvania Station.
1993-10-24	Eating Aboard	To the Editor: I read with interest your article on the Montrealer Amtrak train between New York and Montreal (Sept. 12). I recently rode the sister day train, the Adirondack, from New York to Montreal. Your comments on the not-too-grand cuisine are even more significant for those riding the daytime route. We had a choice of egg salad sandwiches, chicken nuggets or microwaved chicken sandwiches on this 10-hour ride. Though the route up the Hudson and along Lake Champlain is magnificent, it became a long hungry ride for many of the passengers.
1993-10-17	Buses on a Roll	"To the Editor: Having just returned from a three-week cross-country trip with my son during which we journeyed primarily by train, although we took one bus trip, I read with interest your article, ""By Bus to the Berkshires"" (Aug. 15). We took the bus because we could not stand the thought of reboarding the Amtrak Zephyr after a scheduled 17-hour ride from Chicago to Denver took 30 hours. It was not so much the delay, but the rudeness of the Amtrak personnel, the fact that the train was not cleaned and the lack of enforcement of the no-smoking areas."
1993-10-13	Lapse in Sounding Alarm Is Linked to Derailment	A towboat pilot was lost in a predawn fog without a compass or nautical charts when his vessel rammed a railroad bridge, but he could have still averted the worst wreck in Amtrak's history if he had promptly notified the authorities, Coast Guard and Amtrak officials told Congress today. A high Amtrak official said that had anyone on the towboat Mauvilla reported the accident immediately, the freight railroad that owned the bridge and tracks would have had enough time to send a signal to stop the train, or make radio contact with it in time for the engineer to halt it.
1993-09-27	In Amtrak Inquiry, Details Are Veiled by Conflicts	Federal investigators have pieced together a broad outline of how the worst crash in Amtrak history took place Wednesday in predawn fog in an Alabama bayou. They say they know that the crash that killed 47 people occurred after a bridge was struck and weakened by a wayward barge minutes before the 11-car Sunset Limited, en route from Los Angeles to Miami, began to cross it. But then comes the hard part: the details. Investigators say there are many significant unanswered questions and several crucial conflicts in the evidence and accounts by witnesses gathered so far.
1993-09-26	Accident Puts Barge Owner in Spotlight	The Warrior and Gulf Navigation Company, owner of the towboat and barges entangled in the deadliest train wreck in the history of Amtrak, is a major player in the gritty and less glamorous part of the port business here. While the eye-catching ocean-going vessels attract most of the attention as they steam in and out of Mobile's harbor, there is a vigorous commerce in coal, wood chips, chemicals, petroleum products and other goods traversing the inland waterways.
1993-09-26	THE NATION: Amtrak's Worst Crash; Night, Fog and Death in a Swamp	THERE were screams, chaos, confusion and heroics in a fog-enveloped bayou Wednesday morning when a string of double-decker, Superliner Amtrak coaches and three locomotives was launched from an apparently damaged bridge north of here into the murky waters. Forty-seven people died in the 3 A.M. accident, many of them entombed in cars that were submerged or partially submerged in the 30-foot-deep waters of Big Bayou Canot along the Mobile River. Survivors formed human chains to pull others to safety and soothed panicky fellow passengers trying to ride rising water out of sinking cars.
1993-09-26	Train Journey Into Disaster And Heroism	Michael Dopheide will return home to Omaha on Sunday not just as a survivor of Amtrak's deadliest accident but also as a hero. Passengers say Mr. Dopheide, covered in diesel fuel and menaced by burning debris, guided more than 30 people to safety from a partly submerged coach of the derailed Sunset Limited early Wednesday.

1993-09-25	Government Rejected Sensor System On Nation's Railroad Bridges in 1981	The Federal Railroad Administration more than a decade ago decided against installing sensors on railroad bridges that could have detected the damage that apparently resulted in the Amtrak crash that killed at least 47 people here on Wednesday. After a 1979 freight train derailment on a damaged bridge in Devils Slide, Utah, the railroad agency considered placing detection devices on the nation's 85,000 railroad bridges.
1993-09-24	Choice of Leisurely Ride Proved Fatal for Retirees	Allan and Catherine Renz were afraid to fly. So the retired couple from Bradenton, Fla., took a leisurely cross-country ride to San Francisco six weeks ago. The Renzes were among those killed Wednesday when the Amtrak's Sunset Limited crashed into a bayou near here. Mr. Renz, 70, and his wife, 72, boarded the Los Angeles-to-Miami train after leaving the home of their daughter, Katherine, in San Francisco on Sunday.
1993-09-24	Tracks Apparently Remained Intact When Barge Hit Bridge Before Wreck	Investigators said tonight they had concluded that the rails on a bridge over an Alabama bayou were intact before Wednesday's fatal train crash, thus preventing a warning system from alerting the train crew of possible damage to the span. Coast Guard officials said earlier today that the derailment of Amtrak's Sunset Limited, with 210 people aboard, occurred after a towboat pilot, apparently disoriented in late-night fog, strayed from the Mobile River and lost control of his barges.
1993-09-23	For Passengers, a Nightmare at 70 Miles an Hour	Elizabeth Watts remembers being catapulted out of her sleep and over the seat in front of her. She remembers clambering from her partly submerged train car as warm, muddy bayou water rushed in. But mostly she remembers the surreal sense of horror that pervaded what she thought would be her last moments.
1993-09-23	DOZENS ARE KILLED IN WRECK OF TRAIN IN ALABAMA BAYOU	More than 40 people were killed early today when part of an Amtrak train hurtled off a 12-foot-high trestle into a bayou and caught fire, trapping sleeping passengers in black water up to 30 feet deep. The accident, one of the worst on American rails since World War II and the deadliest in Amtrak's 23-year history, occurred about 3 A.M., when the Sunset Limited from Los Angeles was crossing Big Bayou Canot at 70 miles per hour on its way to Miami with 189 passengers and a crew of 17.
1993-09-12	To Montreal, the Restful Way	TO choose to travel by train instead of by plane is like writing a letter instead of making a long-distance phone call. You have to want the slower pace, the scenery, the rhythm of wheel on rail. Specifically, on Amtrak's overnight train from Montreal to New York, a passenger can dine while gazing out the window as the sun sets behind the Green Mountains in rural Vermont -- and first-class passengers can have room-service breakfast in their private compartments the next morning.
1993-08-25	Judge's Order Bars Walkout On Amtrak	A Federal judge signed a temporary restraining order yesterday that prevented today's rush hour from going nowhere on rail lines tied to Amtrak. The order, from Federal District Judge Stanley Harris in Washington, came near the end of a day that rail officials spent scrambling to make sure they were prepared for a threatened walkout that would have affected 62,000 riders on Amtrak throughout the country, as well as commuters on Metro North and the Long Island Rail Road.
1993-08-08	Penn Station	To the Editor: My husband and I arrived at Penn Station in New York in early June, en route to a trans-Atlantic cruise. We each had a heavy suitcase. To our dismay, we discovered that not one of the escalators was working, and hundreds of passengers were being funneled to the stairs. While we debated what to do, another passenger hailed a redcap, who picked up her bag, unlocked one of the escalators with a key in his possession and, while a guard stood at the bottom to prevent anyone else from getting on the now-functioning escalator, took his passenger up. Clearly, there was no mechanical problem.
1993-07-04	New Rochelle's Fear: Sidetracked by Amtrak	AS Amtrak proceeds with plans to develop its Northeast Corridor for high-speed service between New York City and Boston, officials here fear that plans to revitalize the city's struggling downtown may get sidetracked in the name of progress. For Amtrak, the stop at the busy station here, which it shares with Metro-North Commuter Railroad, has become a scheduling nightmare, a bottleneck at which trains meet frequent delays and Amtrak engineers often have to negotiate complicated track crossovers with Metro-North before continuing to the next destination.
1993-07-04	Stepping Over the Line	"To the Editor: In his essay ""In This Dream Station Future and Past Collide"" [ June 20 ] , Herbert Muschamp frets about the degree of visibility and amount of space devoted to retail shopping and advertising signs in Amtrak's proposed station in the landmark James A. Farley Building. At the same time, he ignores what may be a more serious preservation issue associated with this extraordinary project."
1993-07-04	Esthetics Vs. Expediency	To the Editor: The relocated Amtrak lobby proposed for Penn Station represents expensive, prettified inconvenience. It is comparable to giving the towering headpiece of a Las Vegas showgirl to someone with weak knees and osteoporosis.
1993-06-24	Zephyr Journal; Guiding a Roar Across the Heartland	Inside the California Zephyr, Amtrak's transcontinental train between Chicago and Oakland, Calif., America is on vacation. It's a full house. School is out and there are a lot of families on board, maybe 300 passengers all told, and they're exchanging stories with strangers about the weather in their home towns, coddling babies, visiting the snack bar, passing judgment on the views of Rush Limbaugh. There are a lot of video cameras pointed out the windows and almost everyone, it seems, is carrying a paperback by John Grisham, including a Baptist clergyman from Springfield, Ill., named John Grisham.
1993-06-20	In This Dream Station Future and Past Collide	Already, it is a landmark: that soaring arch of white steel, rising above granite walls of classical Beaux-Arts grandeur. Depicted in architect's renderings with sunlight streaming through its sparkling glass skin, the arch brings out the primal emotions aroused by the sight of a rainbow after a storm. It may be years before this vision materializes. The $315 million needed to build it is not yet in hand. But Amtrak's proposal to resurrect Pennsylvania Station from a pit beneath Madison Square Garden and enshrine it within the landmark general post office building across the street has aroused more anticipation than any civic project in years. No wonder, for this project pushes some of the hottest buttons in architecture and urbanism today. Public space. Infrastructure. Mass transit. Regional planning. But the hottest button of all is one that touches off a painful memory: the destruction of the original Pennsylvania Station station 30 years ago. The razing of this station, McKim, Mead & White's 1910 masterpiece of Beaux-Arts design, was one of the greatest traumas New York City ever suffered. Public reaction was profound, and in some ways beneficial. Historical preservation was transformed from a genteel pastime to a nationwide movement with political clout. Architects began to admit that the Modern movement was turning out to be less than a boon for cities. Above all, New Yorkers began to assert a proprietary interest in the city as their collective cultural heritage.
1993-05-30	2 Are Arrested In a Derailment That Injured 72	Two Coast Guard members were charged on Friday with derailing an Amtrak train last year by switching the tracks moments before the locomotive passed at full speed, the authorities said. The train, the Colonial, which originated in New York, wrecked on Aug. 12 five miles before it was scheduled to reach Newport News. The accident injured 72 of the 123 passengers, and the engineer remains on medical leave.
1993-05-12	Pennsylvania Station Rebirth Will Aid Region	To the Editor: Your May 2 article on Amtrak's proposal to move New York's Pennsylvania Station to the General Post Office building across the street fully investigates important esthetic issues. But it does not discuss other considerations, which should be seen as equally significant.
1993-05-11	Landmarks Panel Parodies Its Reason for Being; Penn Station Dream	To the Editor: The architectural drawing of Amtrak's proposed plan to build a new Pennsylvania Station for New York within the interior of the General Post Office brought a smile to my face (news article, May 2). Looking at the rendering of the steel and glass concourse that would serve Amtrak's long-distance passengers, I could only think of the affection the demolished station still has for those who would put it all back, if they only knew the right genie. When I wrote the history of Pennsylvania Station, it amazed and delighted me to see young people, too young to have walked through the station, feel such an emotional connection to it. I still get calls from one young man who refuses to accept that the station, which has been gone for three decades, cannot be reconstructed. I end up rummaging through my memory and conjuring it up for him, blunting his frustration with a story that will never be his.
1993-05-11	An East Coast Express? Maybe, in New Rail Plan	With faith that three-hour train trips from New York to Boston will be commonplace in a few years, about 100 rail experts gathered here to sketch out the next step: an advanced rail network that would extend over much of eastern North America. Amtrak hopes to begin work next spring on electrifying the railroad north of New Haven to South Station in Boston, continuing a project that stopped 80 years ago.
1993-05-09	Smoking Ban By Amtrak	Amtrak has banned smoking on all Northeast Corridor and Empire Corridor trains with scheduled running time of less than four and a half hours. The Northeast Corridor trains affected include the Metroliner between Washington and New York, the New England Express between Boston and New York, and all conventional unreserved short-distance trains. The Empire Corridor service includes trains between New York and Albany and New York and Schenectady. Trains like the Washington-Boston service that operates via New York will continue to allow smoking on designated cars.
1993-05-02	Amtrak Unveils Its Design To Transform Post Office	Under soaring, echoing vaults of glass, within a monumental forest of neo-classical columns designed by McKim, Mead & White, railroad passengers in New York City stream through a gateway as colossal as the metropolis it serves. That describes the Pennsylvania Station of 1910. It does not describe the claustrophobic, overcrowded, underground space that replaced it almost three decades ago.
1993-04-11	Miami to L.A. On Amtrak	Last Sunday, Amtrak began operating the first regularly scheduled transcontinental train service in United States rail history. The Sunset Limited, which runs triweekly, traverses eight states (Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California) during its 68-hour, 3,066-mile trip between Miami and Los Angeles. The bilevel coach cars have reclining seats and there is a sightseeing car with chairs facing large windows that curve up into the ceiling of the car's upper deck. A full-service dining car features china, white linen and regional meals from the Southern states.
1993-03-28	Amtrak Delays New Schedule	"Amtrak schedules for the entire system that were due to change April 3, with the start of daylight time, will remain in effect until May 1. The summer schedule, effective May 2 through October, will involve ""hundreds"" of changes to allow for extensive track work in the Northeast and the necessary new national connecting times, according to an Amtrak spokeswoman. The track work was decided on too late to print revised timetables in time for the expiration of the winter 1992-93 tables, so the winter tables will remain in effect for the extra month."
1993-03-02	T.W.A. and Amtrak emphasize creature comforts, not prices.	"THIS selling proposition will no doubt prompt sneers from the legions of people who hate to travel, but two underdogs of transportation, Trans World Airlines and Amtrak, are promising to make trips less stressful, even relaxing. In their new advertising campaigns, the two companies aim to shift travelers' attention away from the dizzying fare wars of the big airlines. ""We're trying to separate ourselves from the pack,"" said Robert B. Cozzi, senior vice president of marketing for T.W.A., whose message echoed that of Amtrak officials."
1993-02-21	Now Arriving: Costliest Plans For Commuter Lines Since 1970	ANYONE who sits idling in traffic on Interstate 95 has dreamed of a less painful way of getting to work. Highways choked with traffic and a shortage of parking are pushing people to search for a better way to get from one place to another. Now, two railroad construction projects underway in the state are expected to keep commuter trains closer to their schedules as well as reducing travel time between Boston and New York. The improvements are meant to get people out of their cars, off the plane and onto the train.
1993-02-06	Judge Upholds the Right Of Artist to Use Billboard	A Federal judge ruled yesterday that Amtrak must permit an artist to display a montage criticizing the owners of the Coors Brewing Company on a giant billboard in Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. The unusual case involves an artist with a fondness for political parody, Michael A. Lebron, who sued Amtrak because it refused to lease the billboard to him. Amtrak rejected the artist's montage of pictures and text on the ground that it had a policy of barring political advertising from the billboard.
1993-02-04	Amtrak Gains Accord for Wide Use of Fast Trains	Clearing an important obstacle to the development of high-speed rail travel outside the Northeast, the nation's freight railroads agreed today to let Amtrak use fast European trains on their tracks. Under the agreement, Amtrak plans to guarantee that the freight lines will be indemnified against liability for accidents involving its trains, said W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, the national passenger railroad corporation.
1993-02-02	Fast and Posh, X-2000 Train Picks Up Fans	"Ian Campbell boarded the train at Washington's Union Station after arguing a copyright case before the Federal Court of Appeals and pronounced his surroundings ""very plush, very good for working and relaxing."" Juanita Jackson came on board in Baltimore, after meeting with an orchestra board, and said, ""I thought I'd stepped onto a cloud."" Bill Woomer, a lawyer, boarded in Wilmington, Del., and said, ""It beats the heck out of what I'm used to, the Yankee Clipper."""
1993-01-31	Amtrak Begins High-Speed Shuttle Run Tomorrow	Amtrak's new high-speed train will begin commercial service on Monday between New York and Washington, making a single round trip every weekday. But though the train can go 30 miles an hour faster than the Metroliner it replaces, it will not arrive any sooner. Passengers who leave Washington's Union Station on the noon run will board a Swedish-built X-2000, whose special steering and suspension enable it to take curves at high speeds.
1993-01-27	Amtrak to Test New Tilt Train	"Amtrak said today that it would soon begin a three-month test of a ""tilt technology"" passenger train capable of speeds up to 155 miles an hour on its Northeast express corridor. The train, which is being leased from the Swedish rail system, will begin regular passenger service between Washington and New York City next week, according to Sue Martin, an Amtrak spokeswoman."
1993-01-10	Conference Car On Amtrak Train	Amtrak has introduced a club conference car running twice daily between New York and Washington on the Metroliner express. Facilities include a conference room for up to eight people with a private telephone and a marker board for presentations or notes. The car also has two private booths for four passengers, with a table and sliding glass doors for privacy; two semi-private tables each seating two people, and 18 first-class seats. The service started in the fall. The conference room and the private booths for four, which are called club salons, must be reserved separately in advance. The conference car is on the southbound Metroliner from Monday to Friday, which leaves New York at 6:50 A.M. and arrives in Washington at 9:35 A.M., and the northbound return leaving Washington at 4:30 P.M. and arriving in New York at 7:15 P.M. The intermediate stops are Philadelphia and Baltimore.
1992-12-31	Amtrak Sued Over Barring Of Billboard	In a legal battle pitting freedom of expression against the refusal of a government-subsidized agency to accept political advertising, a Manhattan artist says Amtrak has barred him from turning a gigantic billboard at the entrance to Pennsylvania Station into a political critique. The artist, Michael A. Lebron, is suing the agency, seeking to force Amtrak to display the piece. Mr. Lebron, whose acerbic work has hung in subway stations in New York and Washington, says he leased the Penn Station Spectacular, a curved billboard measuring 103 feet by 10 feet that is seen by thousands of people each day as they descend the escalators into the midtown station in Manhattan.
1992-12-06	U.S. and Europe	To the Editor: On a recent visit to Europe -- where most approaches to and from airports are clean, well planned and well designed, whether by road or train -- I could not help but make a comparison with the filthy, disgraceful and unsafe roads from Kennedy Airport to the city and beyond. This kind of symbolic calling card requires a special effort by the city and state to clean up what will otherwise continue to give an unforgettable bad impression. On another recent trip, I traveled to Michigan on Amtrak, boarding the Lake Shore Limited at Penn Station in New York. It left one hour late and arrived at Toledo more than two hours late. We missed our connection to Dearborn. I was told that this sad state of lateness is normal. Amtrak provided buses to Dearborn, which arrived very late. European trains are very punctual by comparison.
1992-12-06	Amtrak to Test Fast Train In Northeast	Amtrak plans to begin testing a high-speed train between Boston and Washington in February and March. Metroliner passengers traveling between New York and Washington will be among those to ride the train, called the X2000, which is being leased from Swedish State Railways. The top speed of both the X2000 and the Metroliner is 125 miles an hour, but while the Metroliner goes fast only on straightaways, the Swedish train can hold speed around curves. The fastest trip on the Metroliner, a nonstop sprint between New York and Washington, is 2 hours 35 minutes, but more typical service that includes intermediate stops is 2 hours 55 minutes. The X2000 will reduce the New York-to-Washington ride to 2 hours 15 minutes. Other projections for the new train include a reduction of one hour in the four-hour run (on the New England Express) between Boston and New York, and faster trips between smaller cities in the Northeast corridor, such as Baltimore, Philadelphia, Trenton, Providence and New Haven.
1992-12-02	A Tilting Train Cuts Travel Time By Rounding the Bends in Stride	In a tortoise-and-hare plot twist, a train using old-fashioned railroad tracks may prove superior to the world's fastest railway technologies when it comes to moving Amtrak passengers through the Northeast Corridor. With the goal of cutting the time on its New York-Boston run, Amtrak has begun testing a type of high-speed electric train developed in Sweden that is able to hug the curves of routes laid out for the lumbering steam locomotives of a hundred years ago.
1992-08-30	Amtrak Offers Special Fares	Amtrak has introduced special off-season fares, available through Sept. 30, that allow three stopovers on a round trip, between tomorrow and Dec. 17. With the ability to make three stopovers, the passenger could make a journey in four segments. The Special All Aboard America fares may be used in one of the following regions, two adjacent regions or all three: eastern region, meaning the Atlantic coast to Chicago and New Orleans; western, Pacific coast to Wolf Point, Mont., Denver, Albuquerque and El Paso, and central, which is everything in between. The costs are $138 for one region, $188 for two adjacent and $228 for all three.
1992-08-24	Three Killed When Train Hits Their Car at Crossing	An Amtrak passenger train traveling from Boston to Washington slammed into a car at a railroad crossing in Wallingford, Conn., yesterday morning, killing all three people in the car, but injuring none of the train's passengers or crew. The collision occurred about 10:15 A.M., three hours after the six-car train left Boston's South Station, at a crossing on a narrow dead-end street in Wallingford marked by only a single yellow-and-black warning sign.
1992-08-16	Rolling Into Penn Station In the Height of Elegance	Toward the end of rush hour on Thursday night, a lavishly renovated railroad car, built in 1928, rolled into Pennsylvania Station on its way to Boston, attached to the end of a thoroughly modern Amtrak train. The car's passengers had been traveling around the country in high style since leaving Los Angeles on Aug. 4, wending their way through Houston, New Orleans, Memphis, Chicago and Washington.
1992-08-14	Train Derailment With 74 Injuries Is Traced to a Vandalized Switch	Federal investigators said today that the derailment that injured 74 of the 127 passengers aboard an Amtrak train here on Wednesday night appeared to have been caused by a criminal sabotage to a rail switch. The investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board said they had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for assistance after finding evidence suggesting that someone had broken into a switch box at the site and had changed the setting, causing the train to careen onto a siding and jump off the tracks.
1992-08-07	MILLIONS PROPOSED FOR NEW YORK AREA IN U.S. TRANSIT BILL	The New York region would receive hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal mass-transit subsidies, along with money to upgrade its rail systems, under the transportation bill now moving toward approval in Congress. The bill, which passed the Senate on Wednesday and the House last month, now moves to a House-Senate conference committee. It exemplifies the radically new philosophy enshrined by Congress last year in giving states great leeway in spending Federal transportation dollars on mass transit. The New York region, because of its reliance on mass transit, stands to be one of the largest beneficiaries of this year's $33.8 billion transit appropriation bill.
1992-08-02	The Montrealer	To the Editor: My friends and I traveled on the Amtrak Montrealer to Canada in May and although this was the third time I had made the trip, I was not prepared for the changes that have taken place. I was told by the conductor that from April 5 Amtrak eliminated the baggage and dining cars and other services on selected long-distance trains. The complimentary wine and cheese for first-class passengers had been eliminated and the contents of the complimentary stationery was pared in half.
1992-07-12	Cross-Country, On One Train	Amtrak is working on a new route to connect Los Angeles and Miami by train. The service, which will start on April 4, 1993, will traverse eight states in about two and a half days (58 hours). There will be three trains a week in each direction. The new Sunset Limited, Amtrak said, will be the first transcontinental train in the United States. In the age before automobiles and planes, individual cars on passenger trains were shuttled from one line to another, but no single train has ever traveled a regular cross-country route. Passengers had to change at either Chicago or New Orleans.
1992-07-12	Streetscapes: Pennsylvania Station; On Preservation, 'I Told You So'	FOR those who fought vainly to save the old Pennsylvania Station in 1962 and 1963, there could be no greater irony than Amtrak's announcement last month that it needs a grander station than the low-ceilinged replacement that opened in 1968. What the railroad now seeks seems to be just what a group of diehard activists fought to preserve three decades ago.
1992-07-06	Congress Capitulates To Railroad Lockout	To the Editor: Once again, Congress has capitulated to the railroad industry and intervened in the labor dispute between unions and management (front page, June 26).
1992-06-28	JUNE 21-27: 20-Day Deadline; Congress Orders Binding Arbitration To End Railroad Strike	The railroad strike came and went last week like a summer thunderstorm, causing a spell of anxiety as it loomed ominously on the horizon, arrived uproariously, and then vanished before most people had time to comprehend the complex forces at work. Congress, as usual in major rail disputes, intervened before the strike could have serious economic effects. This time, though, Congress introduced a new form of binding arbitration, hoping to appease labor and business alike.
1992-06-25	Commuting Into New York: No Strike Means No Problem	"Railroad riders in the New York area were spared the commuter chaos that was predicted if Amtrak workers had gone on strike, as threatened, at 12:01 A.M. yesterday. But if there was a collective ""Whew!"" from Long Island to New Jersey, the relief was temporary. In agreeing to keep talking for only two more days, Amtrak's three major unions had set a new deadline -- and the same uncertainty for commuters -- at midnight tonight. Contingency Plans ""We've got our contingency plans on hold,"" a spokeswoman for the Long Island Rail Road, Susan McGowan, said yesterday afternoon. ""The special emergency timetables that our customers picked up earlier this week, well, they should hold on to them."""
1992-06-25	Most of Rail Network Shuts Down In Response to Strike at One Line	Most of the nation's freight railroads shut down yesterday in response to a limited strike against just one of them, and they immediately began urging Congress to step into the labor dispute by passing legislation imposing contract terms on recalcitrant unions throughout the industry. Amtrak, the passenger railroad, was hobbled by the shutdown because most of its trains outside the Northeast run on lines owned by the idled freight railroads. But many of the nation's biggest commuter lines, including those in the New York area, were not greatly affected.
1992-06-24	STRIKE AT AMTRAK POSTPONED 2 DAYS	Rail maintenance workers last night postponed for two days their threatened strike against Amtrak after failing to reach agreement on a new contract by a midnight deadline. After a day of intense negotiations during which Amtrak reached agreement with several of its smaller unions, the reprieve by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees relieved mounting tension over the possibility of a nationwide strike against commuter, intercity passenger and freight lines.
1992-06-24	Around Penn Station, Uncertain Travelers	Michelle Marriott, an elementary-school teacher from Australia, wanted to go to Niagara Falls. She stood patiently in line at a ticket window in Pennsylvania Station for 45 minutes, only to be told that Amtrak could not take her there, that the trains last night were sold out and that Amtrak was taking no reservations for today. Though an Amtrak strike was averted late last night, that did not help commuters caught off guard all day yesterday.
1992-06-23	Extra Buses and Subways Readied in Case of Strike	Trying to head off a traffic nightmare, transit officials in the New York metropolitan area are bringing old buses out of retirement and creating a new subway line for the quarter of a million commuters who will suffer service disruptions if railway employees at Amtrak and Conrail strike tomorrow. But officials said a strike, which would halt Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak service into Pennsylvania Station and shut down long stretches of track used by N.J. Transit, would cause long delays in subway and commuter bus service and huge tie-ups at the bridges and tunnels leading into Manhattan. The Metro-North Commuter Railroad, whose trains go into Grand Central Terminal, would not be directly affected.
1992-06-23	Long-Distance Train Travel Is Cut In Anticipation of Railroad Strike	With a possible strike in the offing, many of the long-distance passenger trains that left their stations yesterday may never make it to the end of the line. At train stations from coast to coast, Amtrak agents were warning passengers that they would only be taken as far as a train could go by the tentative strike deadline, 12:01 A.M. Wednesday.
1992-06-21	Chance of a Rail Strike Grows as Talks Bog Down	Railway officials and union leaders made little progress in negotiations yesterday, increasing the possibility of a Wednesday strike at Amtrak, Conrail and other rail lines around the nation. Union officials argue that a strike at Conrail, which carries most of the freight in the Northeast and links up with most major railroads, would cause only limited disruptions. But Conrail officials and railway analysts say its impact would be felt within days at power utilities and factories throughout the United States.
1992-06-20	Commuter Lines Bracing for an Amtrak Strike	"Transit officials in the New York metropolitan region are planning for service disruptions affecting tens of thousands of commuters next week if railway employees strike Amtrak and Conrail. The walkout, which is threatened for 12:01 A.M. on Wednesday, would close Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to commuters who use the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit, halt Amtrak passenger service throughout the region and elsewhere in the nation and shut down the Shore Line East commuter line in Connecticut. The Metro-North Commuter Railroad would not be affected directly, officials said. Nationwide Effects ""Based on what we're hearing from the unions, we anticipate a walkout,"" said Cliff Black, a spokesman for Amtrak, which carries 60,000 riders a day. He said that negotiations were continuing with six unions representing 7,900 workers, mostly in the Northeast."
1992-05-17	Penn Station II: A Post Office?	"In 1963, when workers began dismantling the soaring Doric columns and three-ton stone eagles of the original Pennsylvania Station, a restaurant waiter inside remarked: ""This city's got the right name: New York. Nothing ever gets old around here."" But today, old is good."
1992-05-14	Topics of The Times; The Glory That Was Rail	America lost a monument of irreplaceable grandeur when the Pennsylvania Railroad demolished New York City's Pennsylvania Station three decades ago. Its replacement is confined to a nondescript space under Madison Square Garden on the same site. But now Amtrak is contemplating a brilliant redemption: Move the station across the street to the General Post Office. The old station, with its two-block facade of granite columns, vast waiting room and glass-roofed concourse, celebrated the greatness of New York. So might the Post Office building, which also spans two blocks.
1992-05-13	Amtrak's Envious Look at Post Office	Expecting significant growth in ridership over the next decade, Amtrak is seeking to transform the sprawling General Post Office building at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue into a new station intended to recapture the grandeur of the old Pennsylvania Station. Coming 30 years after the original Pennsylvania Station was leveled to make way for office towers and Madison Square Garden, Amtrak's proposal in effect acknowledges what architects and historians have been saying all along: that demolishing the stately Roman Revival building was an appalling mistake.
1992-04-19	Amtrak Expands Virginia Service	Amtrak has increased weekend service between New York and Washington and the Virginia Tidewater area. Additional northbound trips operate Friday and Sunday from Newport News, Va., to New York, and one southbound trip runs Friday from Washington to Newport News. Amtrak has introduced bus connections to Norfolk and Virginia Beach for all Tidewater area trains.
1992-01-12	Amtrak Revises Elderly Discount	Amtrak has revised its discount program for elderly travelers, lowering the age qualification from 65 to 62 and at the same time reducing the amount of the discount. Passengers aged 62 and over can now get a 15 percent discount off the lowest available round-trip coach fare Monday through Thursday. The program began Jan. 6. Previously, travelers aged 65 got 25 percent off the highest one-way fare seven days a week. The lowest round-trip coach fares often sell out quickly, and since the senior discount is computed using the lowest available fare, passengers are advised to reserve well in advance. Senior citizen fares will not be available on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Dec. 26, 29, 30 and 31, 1992.
1991-11-24	Amtrak on Time	To the Editor: The Amtrak on-time listing in Travel Advisory (Sept. 22) could have used a footnote saying that delays for mechanical reasons are not excluded, as they are in the airlines' on-time tabulations. If airlines had to count delays due to missing screws in a stabilizer, for example, their on-times would not look so good. DAVID MILLER Milwaukee A spokeswoman for Amtrak comments: On-time reports do, indeed, encompass delays for mechanical problems, which are excluded from airline reports to the Department of Transportation.
1991-11-17	Thanksgiving On Amtrak	For most, Thanksgiving is turkeys and cranberries and football games, but for the folks at Amtrak, Thanksgiving is the single biggest travel period of the year. To accommodate the people trying to rush home for their holiday feast, Amtrak is scheduling 86 extra trains along the Northeast corridor. A special Thanksgiving schedule will be in effect from Tuesday, Nov. 26, through Sunday, Dec. 1. for travel between Boston and Washington. Other Amtrak areas of operation will have holiday period service extended through the use of extra cars on regularly scheduled trains.
1991-11-05	Truck Accident in Elizabeth Snarls Service on Railways	Rail service for some 30,000 N.J. Transit commuters and intercity passengers on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was shut down for more than two hours yesterday afternoon when a tractor-trailer truck carrying hazardous chemicals struck and became wedged under a low railroad bridge in Elizabeth, N.J. Witnesses said the truck, with a mixed cargo of barbecue propane tanks and toxic pesticides and insecticides, slammed into the 10-foot, 7-inch underside of the steel-reinforced brick bridge at North Avenue at 3:30 P.M. with a roar heard all over the neighborhood just southwest of Newark International Airport.
1991-10-20	Fumes Sicken Passengers As Train Stalls in Tunnel	Two dozen Amtrak passengers were treated by paramedics at Pennsylvania Station yesterday after a crowded train stalled in the tunnel was filled by diesel fumes from its engine. None of the passengers was made seriously ill, officials said, but 16 were taken to nearby hospitals. Some passengers complained that a slow response had turned an annoying delay into an ordeal that they said had left many on the train gagging or vomiting from the fumes.
1991-08-31	All Aboard for the Lost and Found	Railroad commuters and business travelers around the country are creatures of routine, generally carrying with them only familiar things they need for the day. But let them carry something extra -- a raincoat, an umbrella, a gift -- and forgetfulness sets in. Those are the things passengers most often leave on trains. These items are often found soon afterward, by train crews or cleanup workers, and turned in to the lost and found department. The odd range of possessions lost in the New York metropolitan region is typical for other areas, too.
1991-08-21	Teach Amtrak Crews About Passenger Safety	"To the Editor: We were on Amtrak's Empire Builder when it derailed at Saco, Mont., on Aug. 5, 1988, injuring scores of passengers. Our responses to the investigators' included ""Amtrak personnel seemed overwhelmed and confused by the situation""; ""there was no direction or plan demonstrated by the Amtrak people""; there was no one in charge""; ""able-bodied Amtrak employees were standing around with hands in pockets; their attitude reflected at best incompetence, at worst inhumanity, in the face of human distress."""
1991-08-02	Investigators Link Damaged Switch to Fatal Amtrak Crash in S. Carolina	A railroad track switch at the spot where an Amtrak passenger train derailed on Wednesday was damaged and askew when investigators examined it after the crash, officials of the National Transportation Safety Board said today. It is still not clear whether the switch was damaged during the accident, or whether its condition might have caused the crash. But investigators said today that they have turned up the first evidence that the switch might have been defective before the crash.
1991-08-01	7 Killed in South Carolina In Crash of an Amtrak Train	Seven people were killed and as many as 125 were injured today when an Amtrak passenger train traveling from Miami to New York derailed near this central South Carolina city and crashed into freight cars sitting on a factory railroad siding. The predawn crash of the Silver Star pinned some of the 426 passengers in their seats. Many were sleeping when the train crashed. Howard Robertson, a spokesman for Amtrak, said that all of the seven people were declared dead by officials at the scene of the crash.
1991-07-15	90 Evacuated in Amtrak Fire	Ninety passengers on a New York-to-Montreal Amtrak passenger train had to be evacuated today when the train's rear turbine engine caught fire, the authorities said. Chief Jim Favreau of the Beekmantown Fire Department said the fire was reported about 6:20 P.M. No passengers were injured, but some firefighters suffered from heat exhaustion, he said. The passengers were taken by bus to Montreal.
1991-07-09	100 People Are Left Waiting As Amtrak Trains Don't Stop	About 100 people were left stranded at the Amtrak station in Kingston for several hours on Sunday when the 11:20 A.M. Yankee Clipper failed to stop, officials said today. Several stranded passengers complained that despite their frantic waving, other Amtrak trains from Boston to New York also zipped by. About 80 people who stayed at the station were able to catch a train about 2 P.M.
1991-06-05	Vandals Damage Fence Installed Along Tracks Where Child Died	"A day after parks workers installed temporary fencing along railroad tracks in upper Manhattan where a 3-year-old boy was killed by an Amtrak train last weekend, someone tore a gaping hole in the wooden-slat fence. ""After this terrible, terrible accident, why would anyone in their right mind want to tear another hole in this fencing,"" the Parks Commissioner, Betsy Gotbaum, said."
1991-06-05	Topics of The Times; An Invitation to Death	Amtrak denies responsibility. So does New York State's Department of Transportation, which signed off on the railroad's plan to route high-speed passenger trains through three heavily used parks in upper Manhattan without requiring fencing along the tracks. Tell that to the family of Justin James Rodriguez. The 3-year-old boy was struck and killed on Saturday after he wandered away from his mother and onto the tracks, which run through busy Fort Washington Park, along the Hudson River.
1991-06-04	Fencing Erected Along Tracks Where Child Died	Workers from the New York City Parks Department began installing temporary fencing yesterday along railroad tracks in Washington Heights as responsibility for the death of a 3-year-old boy struck by a train over the weekend was tossed about among city, state and Federal officials. At the same time, the Manhattan District Attorney's office began a criminal investigation to determine whether any charges are warranted against Amtrak, the state or the city, said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau.
1991-06-02	Boy, 3, Killed by Train on Reopened Amtrak Line	A 3-year-old boy was struck and killed by a train yesterday afternoon when he ran through a broken fence and onto the recently reopened Amtrak tracks running along Riverside Park in upper Manhattan. The boy, Justin James Rodriguez of 247 Wadsworth Avenue in Manhattan, had wandered away from a picnic with his mother and ventured onto the tracks when Amtrak Train 284, the Niagara Rainbow from Albany, rounded a bend. He was struck at 4:35 P.M. as he tried to beat the train across the tracks, witnesses said.
1991-05-26	Amtrak	"To the Editor: I recently thought of traveling by train from Chicago to Washington with a stop in Cleveland to visit friends. Amtrak offers the following ""service"": an 800-mile trip in about 18 hours (an average of 45 miles an hour), one train per day, stopping in Cleveland at 2 A.M. Compare this with what was just announced for Germany (Travel Advisory, April 21): Hamburg to Munich, a 700-mile trip, in about seven hours (an average of 100 miles an hour) with one train per hour."
1991-05-19	Travel Advisory; Dining Cars On the Auto Train	First-class passengers on Amtrak's Auto Train between the Washington area and Florida now have their own dining cars. The two-level dome cars began offering full-service dining with linen napery, crockery and glassware this month, and the two meals served on the trip, dinner and breakfast, are included in the fare. Previously, passengers in first, or sleeper class, shared cafeteria-style buffet cars with coach passengers. The coach passengers continue to get their complimentary meals in the buffet car. The Auto Train is the only Amtrak service in which meals, including white wine and dessert, are included in the fare. Daily departures, southbound from Lorton, Va., and northbound from Sanford, Fla., are at 3:30 P.M. Reservations: (800) 872-7245.
1991-05-01	New Jersey to Add Trains to Midtown	Thanks to almost $100 million in new money from the Port Authority, New Jersey plans to start work next year on a long-delayed railroad connection that will give four counties a direct train link with Penn Station in Manhattan. The project is designed to link N.J. Transit's Morris and Essex Lines with Amtrak's main New York-Philadelphia line where the two cross in a desolate stretch of Kearny near the New Jersey Turnpike, a few miles northeast of Newark.
1991-04-21	Amtrak in Buffalo	To the Editor: I made a reservation by calling Amtrak at 800-872-7245 for a trip from Buffalo to Boston. The train was supposed to leave Buffalo on March 7 at 5:23 A.M. When I arrived at the station, it was closed. I later learned that the train does not stop at Buffalo and one should go to another town to take it. Of course, I didn't arrive on time and missed the train. Obviously, Amtrak doesn't consider worth mentioning the fact that a trip starting at Buffalo doesn't leave from Buffalo. JULIO KUPLINSKY Amherst, N.Y. Pat Kelly, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, replies: Amtrak is sympathetic to Mr. Kuplinsky's plight and had he asked the reservations taker for the address of the station, he not only would have been given it but also instructions on how to get there. The addresses are also in our national timetable. As in several cities that Amtrak serves, there are two stations for Buffalo. They are the Depew Station, in Depew, about six miles east of Buffalo, and the Exchange Street Station in Buffalo.
1991-04-08	Riding the Past From Grand Central	"Looking back from the observation platform, one hand on the polished old railing, John Wilson wanted to make a few remarks. Mr. Wilson has been a redcap at Grand Central for the last eight years and is as talkative a fellow as you could find anywhere between Manhattan and the long-winded politicians of Albany. But for once not even he could come up with the right words. ""The speech begins, 'My fellow Americans,' "" suggested the man next to him, Richard A. Horstmann."
1991-04-08	Public-Safety Steps Are Still Incomplete On New Train Route	A train route untraveled for decades through Manhattan's Upper West Side, where homeless people built homes and children played, opened yesterday with few warning signs and no fencing in some areas to prevent trespassing. After months of planning the new route, Amtrak officials said yesterday that they still had not completed safety precautions, despite concerns that people who frequent the remote areas could be hit by trains that reach speeds of 80 miles an hour.
1991-04-07	Travel Advisory; Grand Central Trains Rerouted To Penn Station	In a move that will affect one million passengers a year, all Amtrak trains bound for Grand Central Terminal will, beginning today, go to Pennsylvania Station instead. The project will shift 20 trains a day serving upstate New York and Canada to Penn Station, which has had about 100 Amtrak trains a day carrying 5.5 million passengers a year, according to an Amtrak spokesman, R. Clifford Black 4th. Only Metro-North commuter trains, primarily serving Connecticut and Westchester County, will continue to use Grand Central. The change brings the first direct rail connection between the Hudson Valley and Delaware Valley through Manhattan. Passengers from Albany bound for Florida, for example, will be able to make a quick connection within Penn Station. New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road passengers will also have a direct connection for upstate trains. Amtrak officials said the bypass, which has been sought for decades, was expected to attract an additional 120,000 passengers in its first year of operation.
1991-04-06	At Grand Central, a Stop and a Start	In the pursuit of efficiency, Amtrak, the nation's long-distance passenger rail system, will begin tomorrow to run all its long-distance trains headed north of Poughkeepsie through Pennsylvania Station instead of starting them at Grand Central Terminal. That may or may not make good economic sense; what it does mean is that after the Albany-bound Rip Van Winkle leaves Grand Central tonight, the magnificent Beaux Arts landmark that once called itself the gateway to a continent will become just another commuter station. That's sad news, in the sense that it marks the end of a glorious era of long-distance passenger traffic originating and ending in Grand Central -- an era of big-name trains like the 20th Century Limited and the Lake Shore Limited, of red caps and movie stars. But that era has been disappearing for some time, and besides, there's offsetting good news: Grand Central itself is getting a facelift. Its waiting room is being refurbished, and now at night it is bathed in spectacular light furnished by 135 lamps mounted on four nearby buildings and positioned to enhance the terminal's celestial elegance.
1991-04-04	Inquiry Turns to Engineer In Amtrak Crash in Boston	Federal investigators believe an engineer's error rather than mechanical failure caused a train collision in Boston last year that injured 267 people. Members of the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that tests conducted on the brakes of the locomotive on Amtrak's Night Owl train showed no mechanical problems.
1991-04-02	From Journey's End to a Commuter Stop	It's enough to throw the New Yorker magazine's made-up railroad maven, E. M. Frimbo, into a tizzy. When the Rip Van Winkle chugs out of Grand Central Terminal on Saturday night, the Beaux-Arts landmark -- which once billed itself as the gateway to a continent -- will turn into just another commuter station: the gateway to Pelham and Poughkeepsie. In the name of efficiency, Amtrak is switching all its long-distance trains from Grand Central to Pennsylvania Station. Amtrak says that will let passengers from Washington and points south who want to go on to Albany and points north do so by merely going across a train-station platform, not an entire town.
1991-03-24	Travel Advisory; Teen-Agers' Fare	"Amtrak last week expanded its children's fare to include youngsters from age 12 to 15 years. Children are allowed a 50 percent discount off the lowest available adult coach fare, provided they are accompanied by a passenger aged at least 18. Children over 12 may travel alone in daylight hours and provided there is no change of trains, but they pay the full fare. Every adult passenger on Amtrak trains is allowed two children's fare tickets. ""By extending its fare plan beyond the traditional travel industry cutoff age of 12, Amtrak recognizes that young teen-agers typically travel with their families and constitute an important component of the family travel market,"" said Timothy P. Gardner, a vice president."
1991-03-20	Wyoming Journal; The Iron Horse Makes A Comeback Out West	In the past decade, even those with a fierce pride in Wyoming's elbow room had begun to worry about the declining number of elbows. With agriculture and the oil-drilling business hard hit, the state's population declined by 3 percent, or 14,000 people, in the 1980's. And when Amtrak pulled up stakes in Wyoming eight years ago, the state's future seemed especially lonely and bleak.
1991-03-13	After 16 Years, Squatter Leaves Tunnel	Back in the summer of 1974, when he was 32 years old and the long railroad tunnel underneath Riverside Park was uninhabited, John Joseph Kovacs and another man moved into a couple of cinder-block bunkers in the southern end. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Kovacs packed his belongings in three cardboard boxes and moved out. He had been urged to leave by Amtrak, which bought the abandoned tunnel and put a new track through it this winter. The railroad warned Mr. Kovacs and his neighbors, a scattered assortment of squatters who sometimes call themselves the Mole People, or the Tenants of the Tunnel, that on April 7 passenger trains would begin rumbling past their living rooms at 60 miles an hour.
1991-01-07	Fire at Penn Station Prompting a Review Of Safety Procedure	Officials from Amtrak and the New York City Fire Department met yesterday and insisted that their workers had followed prescribed procedures during a fire on Saturday at Pennsylvania Station. But since it took more than two hours to put out the small fire, the officials agreed that both agencies should reconsider those procedures. The fire, which was confined to a small area at the end of Amtrak's No. 2 and No. 3 tracks, disrupted train and subway service Saturday evening. The 1, 2, and 3 IRT subway trains stopped running for more than two hours between 42d and 14th Streets. Between 300 and 400 people were evacuated from Penn Station, and trains of the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and Amtrak were delayed for as long as five hours.
1991-01-06	Travel Advisory; Amtrak Fare For the Disabled	Disabled passengers on Amtrak trains are now entitled to a 25 percent reduction year round on regular one-way coach fares. To obtain the discount, passengers must present identification from an organization like the Foundation for the Blind, a Government agency or a letter from a physician stating the nature of the disability. Disabled children aged 2 to 11 pay 50 percent of the disabled adult fare. Tickets must be bought before boarding. The discount is not available on the Auto Train (Virginia-Florida) or the Metroliner. Companions of disabled passengers do not qualify for the reduced fare, but guide dogs are permitted on trains.
1991-01-06	Fire Forces Evacuation of 400 From Penn Station	A smoky fire on the underground tracks of Pennsylvania Station last evening forced the evacuation of up to 400 people from the huge terminal and halted all train departures and arrivals for several hours. No one was reported injured in the fire, the second major underground blaze in a little more than a week in New York City's transportation system. A fire on Dec. 28 on IRT tracks in downtown Brooklyn killed two riders and injured 150.
1990-12-21	Amtrak Takes Safety Move in Boston	In an attempt to prevent another accident at the Boston train station where a derailment last week injured hundreds of people, Amtrak today installed a signal that will automatically slow any train approaching the station, even if its engineer does not apply the brakes. Because all Amtrak trains carry automatic train control systems intended to slow or stop a train in response to external signals, a train will slow automatically in its approach to the Back Bay station even if the engineer does not apply the brakes.
1990-12-20	Engineers in Train Accident Tried to Brake, Report Says	Federal safety investigators today released new evidence indicating that locomotive engineers had tried to brake an Amtrak train that derailed and struck another train in Boston a week ago, injuring about 265 people. But the investigators, from the National Transportation Safety Board, said the new data were incomplete and inconclusive and therefore did not enable them to pinpoint where, how many times or how hard the brakes had been applied. As a result, they said, they still do not know whether the accident was caused by human error or equipment failure.
1990-12-15	Metro-North Had Banned Engineer in Boston Crash	The senior engineer of the speeding Amtrak train that crashed into a commuter train here Wednesday had such a bad safety record that he had been permanently banned from operating trains between New York and New Haven, railroad officials said today. The engineer, Willis E. Copeland, was banned in March by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which runs from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan to New Haven. Mr. Copeland, 53 years old, was disciplined after twice running through temporary stop signs set up to protect railroad employees working on an adjacent tracks, Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North, said. At the time of the two incidents, Mr. Copeland was operating an Amtrak train on track controlled and maintained by Metro-North.
1990-12-14	AMTRAK ENGINEERS SAY BRAKES FAILED	Amtrak engineers have told investigators that brake failure caused their speeding train to derail and crash into a commuter train here on Wednesday, injuring 265 people. Susan Coughlin, vice chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters tonight that an engineer trainee who was at the controls of the train when it crashed said he tried in vain three times to slow the train before approaching a curve near Boston's Back Bay Station. The train derailed in the curve, officials said.
1990-12-13	At Least 264 Are Hurt in Train Collision in Boston	An Amtrak passenger train arriving from Washington derailed and slammed into a packed commuter train in Back Bay Station this morning, injuring at least 264 people, 10 critically. The impact of the crash pushed the two trains into the air, breaking windows and throwing passengers from their seats. About 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the Amtrak engine and burst into flames, sending black smoke billowing through the underground station in Boston's business district.

Debevoise, but for the commuter on Amtrak's crowded Northeast Corridor Boston to New York route, the ride is at best an inconvenience. During the 1987 holiday season, Amtrak passengers who had paid the full $40-plus fare were forced to take commuter trains; I saw elderly citizens and families with small children endure the five-hour trip sitting on bags in the aisles.

1986-12-31	Which Trains Are Worth Saving?	Want to buy a piece of Amtrak? The Reagan Administration seems eager to sell off the passenger railroad's Northeast Corridor system for $1.5 billion. The prospects of Congressional approval are poor, and the President's motive may be merely to include the $1.5 billion on the revenue side of his new budget. Still, the idea is intriguing on the merits.
1986-12-14	REAGAN BUDGET PROPOSES SELLING PART OF AMTRAK	President Reagan's draft budget for the next fiscal year proposes the sale of Amtrak's Northeast passenger line, serving New York, Washington and Boston, Administration officials said today. In addition, they said, the draft budget calls for a cut of more than 50 percent in Federal aid for urban mass transit systems, to $1.6 billion, from the current $3.4 billion. Mr. Reagan has proposed cuts in mass transit assistance for several years, with only limited success in Congress. Federal budget and transportation officials, discussing their plans for Amtrak, said they were heartened by the success of their five-year campaign to win Congressional approval for selling Conrail, the freight railroad. The budget for the fiscal year 1988, which starts next Oct. 1, is to be submitted to Congress on Jan. 5. Plan Faces Uncertain Fate According to an Administration official working on the budget, the draft proposes selling Amtrak's Northeast Corridor service in its entirety, including facilities owned by the railroad. It has not been decided whether it would be sold to a single private corporation or through a public stock offering, the official said.
1986-11-29	RAILROAD POLICE SUE AMTRAK OVER HOMELESS EDICT	The union that represents the Amtrak railroad police has filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan challenging the company's policy of requiring officers to eject ''homeless and undesirable people'' from Penn Station.

Erick Larsen, the attorney representing the union, the American Federation of Railroad Police, said the union's members were ''faced with tremendous liability'' if they enforced the policy and disciplinary action if they failed to do so.
1986-11-23	AMTRAK ROLLS PAST SHUTTLES IN NUMBER OF RIDERS	Between New York City and Washington, where airline ''shuttle wars'' are the talk of the travel business, Amtrak is carrying more passengers daily than any of the airlines with which it competes. And ridership is increasing on the Metroliner high-speed trains between the two cities. Amtrak's success in the Northeast Corridor is a key factor behind the projection by the Government-subsidized national railroad passenger service that its income will cover its operating expenses next year for the first time since it was created by the Government in 1971. ''Our service is getting better and it's pretty clear airline service is getting worse,'' said Timothy Gardner, Amtrak's vice president for market planning, referring to airport congestion and delays. ''You can tell the airlines' ability to handle the infrastructure problems are getting worse.''
1986-11-17	Accident Causes Amtrak Delays	An Amtrak passenger train struck an unoccupied truck that was parked alongside the track yesterday, delaying by several hours passengers traveling to Niagara Falls, the authorities said.
1986-10-14	AMTRAK TO EXPAND IN NORTHEAST AND MIDWEST	Amtrak plans to expand its passenger train service in the Northeast and Middle West starting Oct. 26 to accommodate an increase in both passengers and mail carried by the system. Two high-speed Metroliner trains are being added between New York and Washington, increasing daily capacity in each direction by 500 seats, according to the railroad. To make more arrivals on time, Amtrak also said it would increase allowable operating speeds to 125 miles an hour from 120 m.p.h. The addition of the two trains, which depart at 10 A.M. and 11 A.M. from both cities, means that Amtrak will have reserved-seat train service every hour on the hour from 6 A.M. until 6 P.M. in each direction. The average travel time is about 2 hours 50 minutes, as against about 3 hours 30 minutes on local service trains with lower fares and unreserved seats.
1986-10-13	Derailment Is Linked To Lack of a Signal	An Amtrak train carrying 300 passengers was going over the recommended speed before it derailed last week because the engineer was not notified in time of a switching maneuver, a Federal investigator said today.

The 17-car Empire Builder, carrying at least 231 passengers and eight crew members from Seattle to Chicago, derailed about 12:20 P.M., a police chief, Scott Rychnovsky, said. A switch in the wrong position may have caused the accident, according to an Amtrak sales manager, Dennis Hamilton.
1986-09-24	COMMUTER-TRAIN DELAYS LESSEN AT GRAND CENTRAL	Both railroads that use Grand Central Terminal reported sharply reduced train delays yesterday as investigators tentatively concluded that an electrical failure had knocked out a key underground switching center.

1986-08-03	RAIL SERVICE TO CAPE HAS CAUGHT ON	Before they boarded Amtrak train No. 270 last Saturday morning, Mark Zelek and Alicia Castilla, two Manhattan lawyers, had talked about a Cape Cod vacation for almost two years. In addition to the lure of sand and sun, Mr. Zelek's family in Harwich, Mass., had been lobbying for a visit, especially since their daughter, Alicia Zelek Castilla, was born 10 weeks ago. The couple's plans were haunted, however, by the reality of getting to the cape. Driving, they said, meant bad traffic even on a good day, and there were never good days in summer. Flying was often complicated by a change of planes in Boston, was usually expensive and was always uncertain because of weather.
1986-07-13	ABOARD THE COAST STARLIGHT	Rail travel appears to have lost a great deal of its appeal to the American imagination. Railroads are neither the ''irresistible bazaars'' that Paul Theroux experienced even in the 1970's, nor do they carry any of the profound social importance attributed to them in the 19th century, when, according to a book written in 1910, they were ''the largest single contributing factor to the welfare and happiness of the people,'' second only to the Christian religion and the public school. Gone are the frontier days of expansion and the mechanics of steam locomotion; gone too the wooden interiors, finished like marquetry lockets. But the one thing that hasn't changed all that much in 50 or 100 years is the natural panorama on either side of the tracks. That alone makes Amtrak in the 80's worth a journey. For visitors from abroad, the typical railroad adventure in North America is usually from east to west, from Chicago to Seattle, San Francisco or Los Angeles across the Rockies on the Empire Builder, the California Zephyr or the Desert Wind. Just as rewarding, however, and perhaps more varied in climate and topography is the north-south run down the West Coast from Seattle to Los Angeles on the Coast Starlight. The overnight journey covers about 1,400 miles and takes 32 hours. In spots it's a good alternative to an automobile trip on U.S. 101.
1986-06-22	RAIL SERVICE FROM NEW YORK TO CAPE COD EXPECTED SOON	Amtrak and Massachusetts officials expect to sign a contract within a few weeks for the first passenger rail service since the 1960's between New York City and Cape Cod. The service will be seasonal, beginning sometime in early July and ending Sept. 14. One train will leqve Penn Station, New York, on Friday evening and another on Saturday morning, each arriving almost six hours later in Hyannis, according to a tentative schedule offered by the officials. A train will leave Hyannis for New York on Saturday and Sunday afternoon. It is expected that the fare will be about $70, round trip.
1986-06-08	NORTHEAST JOURNAL	Making a Call From Metroliner - WITH just the slide of a credit card, busy travelers between New York and Washington can call the limo to meet them at the station, or the pizza parlor to deliver piping hot pepperoni for the precise time they will arrive home. If they are riding a Metroliner, that is. Amtrak introduced telephone service last week, with a minimum of three phones on each of its 12 Metroliners in each direction daily. Passengers need one of five major credit cards - American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club or Carte Blanche - to insert into the slot of the new Railfone. They can dial directly anywhere in the country, including Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico. The cost is $5 for the first three minutes and $1 for each additional minute. The phones take no coins and do not receive calls.
1986-06-03	Question From Metroliner: Can You Hear Me Calling?	The last refuge from telephone addicts crumbled yesterday, as Amtrak inaugurated its first Railfones, on the Metroliner between New York and Washington. Travelers will be able to call anywhere in the country for $5 for the first three minutes and $1 a minute thereafter.
1986-05-14	Amtrak and Union Agree On Binding Arbitration	Amtrak and a union representing more than 300 locomotive engineers today agreed to binding arbitration to settle a dispute that had threatened earlier to paralyze passenger and freight traffic in the Northeast. John Jacobsen, an Amtrak spokesman, announced the agreement after daylong talks today focusing on jurisdiction over the operation of a mobile crane in a freight yard in Bear, Del.
1986-05-12	LAST-MINUTE AMTRAK TALKS AVERT ENGINEERS' WALKOUT IN NORTHEAST	Emergency negotiations between Amtrak engineers and the national rail line averted, at least temporarily, a strike threatened for midnight tonight that would have crippled passenger service in the Northeast and perhaps elsewhere. ''We anticipate normal operations tomorrow,'' said Clifford Black, a spokesman for Amtrak, which operates a passenger railroad in the Northeast and contracts with other roads to haul its passenger trains in the rest of the country. But William Hausleiter, the general chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, said the threatened strike had only been postponed. ''The strike is not canceled,'' he said. ''Its date of effectuation is pending.'' He said the railroad and union officials will meet here on Tuesday to discuss ''a whole program'' of proposed changes in working conditions for engineers.
1986-05-11	Amtrak Offering Talks to Avert Strike	Amtrak offered today to negotiate with its engineers union and a spokesman for the passenger line said it was confident it could avert a strike that union leaders have said would begin at 12:01 A.M. Monday. The union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, is threatening to strike over work and safety rules. Union officials could not be reached for comment.
1986-05-10	Strike Is Threatened By Amtrak Engineers	The union representing Amtrak engineers threatened today to stage a nationwide strike against the national rail passenger line as early as Monday over work and safety rules. The railroad said it did not know of the dispute.
1986-05-04	Unions Sue Amtrak on Tests	Eighteen railroad unions have filed suit against Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, in an effort to bar its testing of employees for drugs and alcohol. The unions, all members of the Railway Labor Executives' Association, which joined the suit, asked the Federal District Court here Friday to declare Amtrak's testing program unconstitutional.

1986-04-27	MOVING AT 120 M.P.H. (SOMETIMES)	After years of declining rail travel in the United States, a steadily growing number of Americans are turning to Amtrak. They are finding that it can often be much more convenient and comfortable and sometimes more reliable to travel by train instead of plane. Experience demonstrates repeatedly, however, that an Amtrak traveler should be prepared to cope with the unexpected, because problems are frequent. Fifteen years ago this Thursday, Amtrak, the Government-subsidized National Railroad Transportation Corporation, assumed responsiblity for operating most of the nation's intercity passenger trains. It has transformed much of the system into a vacation railroad, beckoning to travelers with the time and desire to absorb the passing scene at ground level. In the Northeast, however, the focus is different. Millions of travelers have come to depend on Amtrak for essential travel along the 455 miles between Boston and Washington, known as the Northeast Corridor. The Northeast Corridor system is owned by Amtrak. Elsewhere, trains usually use Amtrak passenger equipment, Amtrak staffs and Amtrak-maintained stations (some of which have been modernized with state assistance), but train operations are usually handled by private railroads whose tracks the trains use.
1986-04-20	Tentative Pact With Amtrak To Improve L.I.R.R. Service	Long Island Rail Road trains should reach Pennsylvania Station more quickly and commuters should be able to move more easily through the station, under a tentative agreement between Amtrak and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The agreement will allow the Long Island Rail Road to redesign corridors in the concourse, eliminating or moving concession stands that now obstruct commuters' access to subways and the street.
1986-04-10	Derailed Freight Train Disrupts Amtrak Service	A freight train carrying hazardous material derailed today, prompting a brief evacuation of 150 nearby residents and forcing thousands of Amtrak passengers to use buses between Baltimore and Washington.
1986-04-06	NORTHEAST JOURNAL	IN CAMBRIDGE, SELF-DEFENSE PLEA UNLESS he receives a pardon from the Governor, a Cambridge, Mass., man will soon go to prison for using an unlicensed pistol to shoot a man who lunged at him with a knife. The Cambridge man, 34-year-old Sylvester Lindsey, faces a mandatory one-year sentence under Massachusetts' strict gun control law. His appeal to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis follows the State Parole Board's refusal last week to grant him a hearing and the State Supreme Judicial Court's denial of his appeal last month. The pistol charge stems from an August 1983 incident at a subway station, where Mr. Lindsey says he was attacked by Eddie Michel, a co-worker at Seymour's Ice Cream. Mr. Michel, who had two prior convictions and was under indictment at the time for armed robbery and assault, denied lunging at Mr. Lindsey.
1986-03-19	TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO F.A.A. IS REPORTEDLY SOUGHT	The Department of Transportation plans to ask Congress to transfer $115 million in the agency's budget to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Coast Guard to help the two agencies avoid temporarily laying off thousands of workers in the coming months, sources in Congress and the department said today. The aviation agency would get $80 million and the Coast Guard $35 million from money appropriated for mass transit, Amtrak and the airport improvement program, the sources said. The programs from which the money would be taken have been unpopular with the Reagan Administration, which has repeatedly advocated the elimination Federal money for Amtrak and of operating subsidies for local transit systems. The proposal from the Department of Transportation is expected to be approved Wednesday by the White House Office of Management and Budget, after which it would go to Congress.
1986-02-02	HOUSE G.O.P. URGED TO AVOID BUDGET SNARE	Congressional Republicans were warned today that they would be hurt in the 1986 election if they got bogged down in debates over cutting the budgets of individual programs like Amtrak, Medicare or student loans. Robert M. Teeter, a Republican polling consultant, issued the warning at a weekend meeting attended by about 35 of the 182 House Republicans. ''If we end up debating these all year,'' he said, ''we're not going to have a very good year.''
1986-02-02	MUST AMTRAK BE SCRAP FOR THE PENTAGON'S MILL?	To the Editor: In years gone by, American Presidents dating back as far as Herbert Hoover used a favorite political maneuver by announcing that they would save the taxpayers money by giving up the Presidential yacht Sequoia. These days, our President seeks the approval of taxpayers by continually threatening to give up another mode of transportation, but one that has far wider-ranging effects than a single vessel plying the Potomac River.
1986-01-25	Penn Station's 75th Year	Amtrak celebrated the 75th anniversary of Pennsylvania Station on Thursday night, slicing a big gooey cake in one of their club cars parked at Track 5. The party was a little late.
1986-01-20	PASSENGERS IN WEST SUFFER MINOR INJURIES IN TRAIN DERAILMENT	An Amtrak train with 190 Seattle-bound passengers derailed south of Tacoma today when a roadbed weakened by heavy rains gave way. Sixteen passengers were taken to three different hospitals for treatment of minor injuries, according to Captain Steve Poythress of the Pierce County Sheriff's office. The train crew told officers that they were following two miles behind a freight train when they noticed a depression in the track ahead, but they were unable to stop before reaching it.
1985-12-24	AMTRAK TRIMMING SCHEDULES ON SOME OF ITS MAJOR ROUTES	Amtrak will reduce passenger-train service on some major routes beginning Jan. 12 because of cuts in Federal funds, officials said today. In several cases daily service will be cut to three days a week. Daily service would resume March 20, when ridership usually picks up.
1985-12-14	AMTRAK ACCIDENT LAID TO BEAVERS	Federal investigators have concluded that the collapse of a series of beaver dams caused the flash flood that undermined a section of track in Vermont last year resulting in the derailment of an Amtrak train. Five people died in the derailment and 26 were seriously injured. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that railroad officials had no way of knowing that the track had been undermined in the night by the flood.
1985-12-09	LAST STOP FOR COAST-TO-COAST SLEEPER CAR	It was the night sky over Arizona that stayed with Belinda Johnson, broad and clear and filled with stars. Mark Espie remembered the persistence of Texas as his train hurtled onward, but the geography stayed the same. ''Texas takes a long time,'' he said. And both remember a peculiar state of mind, being immersed in the country but removed from its cares in the cocoon of a transcontinental sleeping car. When the Amtrak Crescent pulled into New York's Pennsylvania Station yesterday, it marked the last time that rail passengers could board a sleeping car on one coast and emerge from the same car four days later and a continent away.
1985-12-09	3 DIE	Three people were killed when their car was struck by a southbound Amtrak passenger train at a crossing in this northern Dutchess County community this afternoon, the police said. There were no reports of injuries on the train, which was heading south from Albany to Grand Central Terminal in New York City, according to an Amtrak spokesman, Clifford Black.
1985-11-25	Train Kills Reclining W9>oman	A woman was killed Saturday afternoon by an Amtrak passenger train headed for New York City after she lay down on the tracks in the path of the train and refused to move, Columbia County sheriff's deputies said today. The woman, Rennee Knight, 34 years old of Catskill, N.Y., was killed about 4:20 P.M. a half mile south of the Hudson Amtrak station in the Town of Greenport. The train's engineer and fireman saw the woman step onto the tracks and lay down, but were unable to stop in time to avoid her, according to Sgt. Richard Hofstetter.
1985-11-24	Train Derails in Oregon Spilling Carloads of Grain	Fifty-eight grain cars on a Union Pacific Railroad freight train jumped the tracks in a remote canyon in eastern Oregon today, tearing up more than 500 feet of track and disrupting Amtrak traffic.
1985-11-14	Letter: On Transportation;   Amtrak's Gift to Deficit Reduction	To the Editor: A sarcastic Topics item on Oct. 21 (''Railing at the Deficit'') outlines the Congressional budget process as it pertains to Amtrak, the nation's passenger railroad. Citing the original concept of creating a profitable passenger rail system, the piece goes on to ridicule both the $9 billion investment in Amtrak over its 14 1/2-year history and Congress's unwillingness to eliminate entirely Amtrak's funding as examples of Congressional resistance to balancing the budget. Some record-straightening is in order: * No national rail passenger system anywhere is ''profitable.'' From its inception in 1971, no one with even a fleeting knowledge of transportation economics believed Amtrak could ever be profitable in the face of its much more heavily subsidized competition: a multibillion-dollar highway system and a combination of tax-free airport construction bonds coupled with a more-or-less permanently funded Federal agency (the air traffic control system) to make airline profitability possible.
1985-11-03	METROLINER NOT YET AS FAST AS A SPEEDING BULLET TRAIN, BUT IT'S GETTING THERE	With little notice or fanfare, the Metroliners that run between New York and Washington have finally achieved routine speeds of 120 to 125 miles per hour. That achievement has been brought about by a $2 billion reconstruction of Amtrak's main line in the Northeast Corridor that has taken eight years and is now 95 percent complete. It has gone almost unnoticed in the public debate that has lately swirled about the Federal financing of Amtrak, but it has enabled the Metroliners' speed to approach that of the Japanese and French ''bullet trains'' about as closely as is likely in the foreseeable future. Now that high speeds are common in the Corridor, however, locomotive engineers say that pressure to maintain shortened schedules is often forcing them to run the trains at 120 m.p.h. on stretches where speed limits are lower. The pressure ''has caused us to act like we've got a 500-ton Maserati out there,'' said one locomotive engineer, referring to the high-speed Italian sports car.
1985-10-30	Why Mess Up a Good Thing Like Amtrak?	To the Editor: ''Railing at the Deficit'' (Topics, Oct. 21) gives Amtrak appropriations as an example of the unwillingness of Congress to reduce Federal spending, and calls the Administration's request to eliminate Amtrak ''sensible.''
1985-10-24	BILL ON TRANSPORT PASSED BY SENATE	The Senate, rebuffing the Reagan Administration on several issues, today approved a $9.9 billion transportation appropriations bill for the fiscal year 1986. The Administration lost in its effort to abolish operating subsidies for local mass transit systems and Amtrak, the national passenger railroad system. The bill allocated less money for the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration than the Administration had sought. However, after a daylong debate, including a 71-to-25 vote to continue the Amtrak subsidy, the Administration did not seek to defeat the bill and it won final passage by a vote of 84 to 13.
1985-10-24	5 Hurt in Amtrak Train Fire	Five people were injured and some cars received smoke damage in a fire on the Amtrak train City of New Orleans as it pulled into Chicago, officials said. The fire began in electrical cables under the ninth car of the 11-car train Monday morning, an Amtrak spokesman said. The crew stopped the train, put out the fire with fire extinguishers and continued into Union Station.
1985-10-21	Topics;   Uncommon Carriers Railing at the Deficit	What Congress says it wants is to balance the budget by 1991. What does Congress do? Alerted by Representative Fred Eckert of Rochester, we note the case of Amtrak, the national passenger railroad.
1985-10-18	Passengers Injured As Train is Sideswiped	One car of a freight train derailed and tipped into Amtrak's California Zephyr tonight, smashing windows aboard the 13-car double-decker passenger train and injuring 60 people, at least one critically, the authorities said. Most of the injuries were cuts from flying glass, officials said. The Zephyr, bound for Oakland, Calif., from Chicago with 307 passengers and a crew of 21 aboard, was struck by a single car of an eastbound Burlington Northern freight train at 8:55 P.M. said Clifford Black, an Amtrak spokesman.
1985-09-16	Proposed Cut in Funds Would Derail Amtrak	To the Editor: Though New York City is fortunate to be among 500 United States cities served by passenger trains, for many other American cities, rail is not an available travel option. Passenger trains have made a tremendous comeback under Amtrak, with ridership growing and Federal funding declining. But the White House, in its desire to dismantle many Federal responsibilities, wants to eliminate Amtrak. Administration officials advocate reducing our nation's travel options to two - air and highway. Meanwhile, the rest of the industrialized world, which long ago made a firm commitment to rail, enjoys a balanced transport system comprising air, highway and rail.
1985-08-28	AMTRAK SER VICE BACK TO NORMAL ON JERSEY LINES	Full service was restored to Amtrak and commuter rail lines early today while rail officials sought to determine what caused a 12,000-volt power line on tracks linking New Jersey and Manhattan to snap Monday just before the afternoon rush hour. The break in the electric power line, known as a catenary wire, occurred at 3:59 P.M. Monday 4.6 miles west of New York's Pennsylvania Station, in the Meadowlands just past the railroad tunnels running under the Hudson River. Partial service was restored at about 7 P.M. and the break was completely repaired at 3:44 this morning, officials said.
1985-08-26	AS AMTRAK FACES CUTS, BUSINESS IS BOOMING	Like many long-distance trains this summer, Amtrak's southbound Crescent has few empty seats when it stops each day in this steamy east Mississippi town. On most days, the Crescent, which curls across the Deep South on its daily route between New York City and New Orleans, and seven other long-distance trains have been running at or near capacity with vacationers and their families. In fact, throughout the Amtrak system, ridership and revenues have risen at the same time Congress has been studying possible cutbacks of as much as 15 percent in the rail passenger system's annual operating subsidy. ''We got more people wanting to ride the train this summer than we sometimes got the seats,'' said Lamonte Cook, the ticket agent, who says he handles as many as 100 passengers a day out of the tiny station in Meridian, one of four towns in Mississippi that still have daily passenger service.
1985-08-18	AMTRAK RESTORING SHINE TO STATIONS IN NORTHEAST	Throughout the Northeast, once-fading train stations are undergoing a renaissance as a $191 million Federal rebuilding program comes to fruition. Commuters in New Haven, Wilmington, Del., and other terminals served by Amtrak in the region are discovering that beneath the layers of neglect were grand centers of transportation, stations built with style when railroads were in their prime. ''This was a fine old station,'' said Richard A. Phalon, an investment banker awaiting a train at the newly renovated Pennsylvania Station in Newark. ''What they did was clean it up.''
1985-07-21	FIX-UP LAGGING AT PENN STATION	THE plan was designed to end the rush-hour mayhem that more than 70,000 riders of the Long Island Rail Road experience each weekday at Pennsylvania Station. Had it succeeded, by this summer commuters would have been strolling through widened corridors on the L.I.R.R.'s concourse. They would have been shuttled to train platforms on stainless-steel escalators. They would have been relaxing in an air-conditioned waiting area, assured of seats on their trains. But hampered by disputes with Amtrak, the owner of Pennsylvania Station, coupled with a contractual disagreement over the delivery of 174 new cars and planning problems within the L.I.R.R., many of the $365 million in planned improvements are now months and in some cases years behind schedule. Earlier this month, the project suffered another setback when Amtrak turned down a proposed settlement of a longstanding impasse between itself and the L.I.R.R.
1985-07-19	A COMEBACK FOR A REAL TRAIN STATION	Since he first became a redcap in 1948, when American railroads were approaching the sunset of their glory years, Fred Pettit has spent much of his working life at Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. ''I've never timed it up, exactly,'' he said in the evening rush hour the other day. One thing he knows for certain, though: ''They don't build 'em like this no more.'' Thirtieth Street Station is what a train station is supposed to look like. Not, as one Philadelphian said a couple of years ago, like ''a squatty bus terminal or one of those cookie-cutter airline terminals,'' but like a real train station.
1985-07-08	81 Are Injured in Idaho As Amtrak Train Derails	Amtrak's Seattle-to-Chicago passenger train, traveling at 70 miles per hour, jumped the tracks near this town in the northern tip of Idaho early today.
1985-07-07	New Sleepers for Amtrak	ALTHOUGH President Reagan would like to slash its Federal subsidy, Amtrak is looking to its future with the first prototype of a new generation of passenger rail cars. A shiny stainless steel shell glided out of the Budd Company's technical center in Fort Washington, Pa., last week and was transferred to the company's testing site in Philadelphia.
1985-06-06	AMTRAK WORKERS REPORT ON FRAUD	While Amtrak was trying to cut costs, thousands of dollars worth of tools and equipment disappeared and mechanics at a large maintenance shop were working on their bosses' automobiles, Amtrak workers told a Congressional panel today. The House subcommittee was also told of numerous occasions when mechanics at the Chicago facility of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation worked at length on the autos of other employees and used Amtrak equipment, tools and supplies to do chores for senior managers. The abuses occurred at the passenger railroad's locomotive maintenance shop at Chicago, according to the Amtrak workers. They also said that senior officials there were often observed taking Amtrak equipment from the facility.
1985-06-03	Intercity-Bus Subsidy Is a Fraction of Amtrak's	To the Editor: A three-inch kitten may be a vertebrate, but it is inappropriate to conclude therefore that it is the same as a wildcat. ''Rallying Round the Amtrak: Deficits and All'' (Washington Talk page, May 10) points out that Amtrak's subsidies are identified fully, ''unlike the subsidies for intercity buses, which come in the form of a break on diesel fuel taxes.''
1985-05-26	On Amtrak	As Representative James J. Florio sees it, there are contradictions in the Administration's efforts to get the Government out of the business of subsidizing Amtrak. So he wrote the President a letter. Mr. Florio, a New Jersey Democrat, is chairman of the House transportation subcommittee, which has voted to keep the Amtrak subsidies.
1985-05-25	Youth Is No Crime	To the Editor: Tom Wicker's May 3 column on David A. Stockman's diatribe against Amtrak unfairly associated the poorly developed views of the management and budget director with his youthful age. Seven times Mr. Wicker used either ''young'' or ''youthful'' to describe Mr. Stockman in an unimaginative attempt to emphasize the immaturity of Mr. Stockman's position.
1985-05-21	Engineer Charged	A warrant for the arrest of the engineer of an Amtrak train that struck a car at a crossing here April 17, killing a woman, was issued today, officials said. The warrant, issued by the Hartford County state's attorney's office, charges the engineer, William R. Civale, 47 years old, of Schenectady, N.Y., with criminally negligent homicide and first-degree reckless endangerment, both misdemeanors. Judy D. Boutwell, 31, of Windsor Locks, was killed in the crash.
1985-05-15	Report Is Inconclusive On Fatal Train Crash	A Federal safety panel reported today that it was unable to identify who was responsible for the head-on collision of two Amtrak trains in New York City last year that killed one person and injured 140 others. The panel said the crash was evidently caused by human error, because tests showed the equipment used to direct the trains was functioning correctly shortly after the crash last June 23, said a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, Ira Furman.
1985-05-10	What Makes Amtrak Vulnerable to Cuts	To the Editor: ''Stockman Presses Senators to End Amtrak Subsidy'' (news article, April 30) quotes David A. Stockman, Federal budget director: ''There are few programs I can think of that rank lower than Amtrak in terms of the good they do, the purpose they serve and the national need they respond to.'' This from the man who thinks nothing of giving the Corps of Engineers five times Amtrak's budget to provide free right-of-way to America's barge operators.
1985-05-10	Rallying Round the Amtrak: Deficits and All	When the Reagan Administration began choosing Federal programs it wanted to eliminate to help reduce the deficit, its selection of Amtrak as easy pickings would seem to have been a logical choice. Amtrak carries only 2 percent of all intercity travelers each day. In 22 of the 44 states in which it operates, the level of service amounts to little more than a train a day in each direction. Its half-billion-dollar annual subsidy is a separate item in the Federal budget, unlike the subsidies for commercial aviation, which are tucked into the Federal transportation budget, and unlike the subsidies for intercity buses, which come in the form of a break on diesel fuel taxes.
1985-05-07	Amtrak Crash Kills a Driver	An Amtrak passenger train hit a State Highway Department vehicle today, killing the driver, who apparently had not been looking, the authorities said. None of the 102 passengers or crew aboard the train was hurt in the accident that occurred shortly after 8 A.M., the authorities said. The train, going from Chicago to Seattle and Portland, Ore., was delayed for two hours.
1985-05-03	PANEL VOTES TO CONTINUE U.S. SUBSIDY FOR AMTRAK	A House subcommittee today rebuffed the Reagan Administration and voted unaminously to maintain the Government subsidy for Amtrak at its current $684 million level for the next two years. The Admiminstration wants to eliminate the subsidy of the national passenger railroad as part of its efforts to reduce the deficit. President Reagan has repeatedly attacked the subsidy, characterizing Amtrak as a ''mobile Federal money-burning machine.''
1985-05-03	YOUNG DAVID'S TANTRUM	David Stockman, the boy genius of the Reagan Administration, threw a tantrum the other day before a Senate subcommittee. If senators did not have ''the courage, the foresight, the comprehension'' to ''pull the plug'' on what he called an ''irredeemable'' Amtrak rail passenger system, he saw little hope for deficit reduction or for avoiding a ''whopping tax increase.'' 36.8,0,165.6,2,423.2,0,4 23.2,2>There, there, little man. It won't be as bad as all that, if Amtrak survives. Take Elizabeth Dole's word for it. As Secretary of Transportation, she affirmed last September that she shared the view of Federal Railroad Administrator John H. Riley that Amtrak had made ''great strides'' toward ''modern, cost-efficient intercity rail passenger service'' - running in 1985 ''more route miles than it did in l981 at approximately 28 percent lower funding.'' Mrs. Dole, far from sharing young David's hysteria about what he cutely called a ''mobile money-burning machine,'' had asked for a $765 million Amtrak subsidy for fiscal 1986. But that was before the youthful Budget Director began to drum his heels. He and President Reagan squawk frequently about a $35-per-head subsidy that each Amtrak passenger supposedly receives. This prestidigitation requires adding the Amtrak subsidy to the amount that Amtrak business travelers can deduct from their income taxes, and dividing by 20 million passengers; presto! $35 a head.
1985-04-30	STROCKMAN PRESSES SENATORS TO END AMTRAK SUBSIDY	David A. Stockman, the Federal budget director, urged a Senate panel today to ''solve the Amtrak waste problem'' by shutting off the railroad's Federal subsidy and letting it go into bankruptcy. Urging the lawmakers to ''pull the plug'' on Amtrak, the budget director declared the Government-sponsored national rail passenger system ''irredeemable'' and said the Administration was rallying its forces around elimination of the Amtrak subsidy as a demonstration of its resolve to reduce the Federal deficit. Offering the Administration's toughest assault on Amtrak, Mr. Stockman said the Administration viewed Congressional action on the subsidy as ''the litmus indicator'' of members' willingness to make significant cuts in the Federal deficit, projected at $200 billion this fiscal year. ''There are few programs I can think of that rank lower than Amtrak in terms of the good they do, the purpose they serve and the national need they respond to,'' Mr. Stockman told the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
1985-04-29	Train Runs Added In New York State	Several additions to Amtrak's schedule throughout New York State, including more weekend trains and a Friday rush-hour express between New York City and Albany were made today, the State Transportation Commissioner, James L. Larocca, said. Mr. Larocca said the Federal passenger railroad has added two morning departures from Niagara Falls to New York City and would allow passengers to board southbound trains in Poughkeepsie and Croton.

The woman - Judy Boutwell, 31 years old, of 61 Bristol Road in Windsor Locks - was driving west on Pierson Lane when her car collided with the northbound Connecticut Yankee train, according to Officer Thomas LePore of the Windsor Police Department. Mrs. Boutwell was pronounced dead at the scene. Her 14-year-old daughter, Melanie, was taken to the St. Francis Hospital in Hartford with minor injuries.
1985-04-17	26 Are Injured in Derailment	The Amtrak Zephyr en route to Denver from California derailed in a canyon on the western side of the Continental Divide tonight, injuring at least 26 people, six seriously, the authorities said. Two engines and three passenger cars of the 12-unit train left the tracks in Fraser Canyon about 8 P.M. as the train was traveling about 30 miles an hour, said Clifford Black, an Amtrak spokesman in Washington.
1985-03-27	AMTRAK'S SAFETY IS ASSESSED	A Government report said today that Amtrak's heavily traveled Northeast Corridor had a number of training and maintenance problems but was being safely operated. About 18,000 passengers a day use the Washington-to-Boston portion of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation's line.
1985-03-12	Amtrak Requires and Deserves Federal Support	To the Editor: As a former president and chairman of Amtrak, I can testify that one of the great challenges Amtrak management faces - one particularly acute in times of budget debate - is correcting common misunderstandings about operating and financing intercity rail passenger service. ''The Amtrak Worth Saving'' (editorial, Feb. 27), calling for elimination of all Federal support for Amtrak, was constructed on a foundation of factual error. Whether the public should support Amtrak, or any other mode of transportation, is legitimate issue for debate. But proper debate cannot ignore plain facts.
1985-03-10	Song of the Rails in the Northern Heartland	To the Editor: Is not your editorial ''The Amtrak Worth Saving'' (Feb. 27) a little parochial? You suggest saving Amtrak ''in the densely traveled corridors where trains are really needed.'' Take the Empire Builder from Seattle any afternoon.
1985-03-09	SHOULD FEDERAL SUBSIDY FOR AMTRAK BE ENDED?	As part of his sweeping deficit-cutting agenda, President Reagan has asked Congress to end Federal subsidies to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, which operates Amtrak. Amtrak says it cannot operate without a Federal subsidy, which this year amounts to $684 million, or 42 percent of its budget, and would go out of business Oct. 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year, if the subsidy was ended. The debate over the Administration's proposal boils down to this: Should the Government subsidize rail passenger service? The Background Passenger trains were once the dominant mode of commercial intercity transportation. In 1929 about 20,000 passenger trains carried 77 percent of the passengers using public transit between cities. Buses carried 15.4 percent, and airlines were embryonic.
1985-03-08	SENATE COMMITTEE VOTES TO CONTINUE MASS TRANSIT AID	The Senate Budget Committee voted today to continue Federal subsidies for Amtrak and mass transit, rejecting President Reagan's proposals to end them. It also decided that the 1986 budget it was drafting should include most of the student loan programs earmarked by Mr. Reagan to be ended. This evening the committee deadlocked on Social Security as it defeated a proposal to eliminate the cost-of-living increase for one year and also defeated, on two votes, a proposal to leave the cost-of-living increase intact. A third proposal to limit the cost-of-living increase to the needy was also defeated. New Vote Is Planned ''We have to vote again but not this week,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, chairman of the committee, The committee worked until after 10 P.M. and then recessed until Tuesday, when it is expected to resume work on the budget package.
1985-03-06	Chicago Train Hits Auto	Amtrak's Broadway Limited with 150 passengers aboard crashed into an automobile at a crossing near here Monday, but no injuries were reported, the city police said. The police said the driver had apparently jumped from the auto and fled before the train hit it. The crash, at 7 P.M., delayed the train 20 minutes on its way into Chicago from New York.
1985-03-01	Judge Continues Curb On Amtrak Job Action	A Federal judge today continued to bar Amtrak police officers from striking the railroad. Judge Stanley S. Harris of Federal District Court said at a two-hour hearing here that he hoped to decide by Friday on a series of union requests, including barring the railroad from allowing non-Amtrak officers to patrol its property.
1985-02-19	THE END OF THE LINE	Why should the Reagan Administration, even with its self- created budget crisis, kill a 24,000-mile rail passenger system that carried 20 million travelers last year - including 60 percent of air-rail traffic in the New York-Washington corridor? Rising costs? Not at all; Amtrak's Federal subsidy, reflecting its improving performance, has declined by 26 percent since 1980, in dollars ad-justed for inflation. Even in current dollars, the system is receiving less from the Federal Government than it did in 1978. Still, Administration spokesmen charge that taxpayers subsidize every Amtrak passenger by about $35 per trip. They add a $639 million Federal subsidy to the $46 million that business travelers could deduct from income taxes for rail travel in 1984, and divide by 20 million passengers.
1985-02-15	RAILROADING AMTRAK	If every Federal program were operating today at its 1977-78 funding level, there would be little if any deficit crisis. And that's just what Amtrak, the national railroad passenger service, is doing: its Federal subsidy was $600 million in 1977, $716 million in 1978 - but just $684 million in fiscal 1985. The trend, moreover, is down. Since a congressionally mandated reorganization in 1979, Amtrak's annual subsidy has declined by 26 percent in dollars adjusted for inflation, and by nearly $200 million in current- value dollars.
1985-02-08	Please Don't Shoot the Iron Horse	To the Editor: The White House proposes to shut down Amtrak. Is that any way to reward a company that has taken so seriously the nation's deficit crisis? Has any other recipient of Federal grants during the last four years cut its reliance on such funds nearly 25 percent, improved its efficiency (i.e., operating ratio) 20 percent and at the same time delivered better service?
1985-01-09	Faulty Repair Caused Train Crash, Board Says	A Federal safety board concluded today that improper track repairs led to the 1983 crash of an Amtrak train that killed four people in Texas.
1984-12-25	Train Kills 2 Asleep on Track	Two aliens sleeping on a railroad track were killed when they were hit by an Amtrak train about 50 miles north of the Mexican border late Saturday, a spokesman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Sunday. Three other aliens sleeping near the track were not injured and were turned over to the Border Patrol, the spokesman said.
1984-12-22	New Ruse on the Rails	''Beware - the railroad robbers have a new deal for Christmas!'' The warning comes from Rodney and Margaret Pinder, who learned the hard way. The Pinders had stowed shopping bags full of Christmas gifts on the overhead rack and were waiting for their train to pull out of Pennsylvania Station when an apparently agitated man distracted them.

1984-12-05	Homeless Asked to Quit Station and Use Shelters	Mayor W. Wilson Goode, criticized for the way the city is dealing with homeless people staying at the main Amtrak rail station, has personally asked them to use available shelters. Mayor Goode toured the station with a police escort Monday night, asking people to go to city shelters.
1984-11-29	ONCE-A-YEAR OPPORTUNITY TO SLEEP AN EXTRA HOUR ON AMTRAK	To the Editor: Have you ever wondered what the airlines do with the three hours that you lose flying from the West Coast to the East? Probably not. Everyone knows that when it's 6 A.M. in California, it's 9 A.M. in New York, and while it may take a little while for the mind and body to adjust after a cross- country trip, nobody blames the airline for spending three hours more on the plane eastbound than westbound. Now, the change from daylight saving time to standard time is another story. It always confuses some people. ''Do I set my watch ahead an hour or back an hour? Should I reset my clock before I go to bed, or should I get up at precisely 2 A.M. to make sure I'm on time?''
1984-11-26	Weapons Search Stalls Train Traffic	A Philadelphia-to-Boston Amtrak train with 500 passengers aboard was halted at New Haven for 90 minutes yesterday as authorities searched unsuccessfully for four men believed to be carrying weapons. The incident caused delays of 20 minutes or more for thousands of holiday travelers on one of the busiest travel days of the year, an Amtrak spokesman said.
1984-11-23	2 MEN ELECTROCUTED WHILE RIDING ATOP A COMMUTER TRAIN IN JERSEY	Two 21-year-old men riding atop an N.J. Transit commuter train were killed yesterday when they were electrocuted by the train's power arm, authorities said. One of the men was also hurled into the path of an oncoming Amtrak train outside Newark. The bodies of the two men were discovered more than a mile apart, one atop a car in the 10-car N.J. Transit train as it pulled into Newark's Pennsylvania Station and the other in the train yards at Harrison, N.J., across the Passaic River from Newark.
1984-11-21	L.I.R.R. SERVICE IS HALTED AS POWER FOR SIGNALS FAILS	The Long Island Rail Road was brought to a standstill yesterday afternoon when a power failure knocked out its signal system. By the evening rush hour, service was restored on the L.I.R.R., the nation's largest commuter railroad, through the use of written instructions to conductors and manually operated signals. But delays were extensive and confusion widespread in Pennsylvania Station as thousands of commuters tried to get home. The signal failure, which began at 1 P.M. and ended at 6:45 P.M., also affected Amtrak service in the Northeast, with some trains experiencing delays of up to two hours, officials said.
1984-10-19	U.S. Questions Crews of 2 Trains	Federal officials today began questioning crews of an Amtrak work train and a Conrail freight train that crashed two miles east of the train station here Wednesday. Railroad officials have cited human error as the probable cause of the crash, which injured six crew members and disrupted rail traffic along the Northeast Corridor. Service was reported near normal today for thousands of passengers on the New Haven division of Metro- North.
1984-10-18	TRAIN CRASH AT STAMFORD TIES UP LINES	An Amtrak work train crashed into the back of a Conrail freight train near Stamford, Conn., early yesterday morning, injuring six crew members and disrupting rail traffic along the Northeast Corridor for most of the day, officials said. The accident forced thousands of Metro- North Commuter Railroad passengers to use a mixture of bus and train service to get to their destinations. Delays of up to 90 minutes were reported. Many commuters, having heard news reports of the accident, turned to their cars and found sizable tie-ups on nearby highways, according to the Connecticut state police.
1984-10-07	HOW AMTRAK IS WOOING THE TOURIST;	To those who complain that rail travel in the United States is not what it used to be, Amtrak's reply, in effect, is ''Who cares?'' Under the leadership of its president, W. Graham Claytor Jr., who formerly headed the Southern Railway, the idea has been not to restore the past, but to build a new type of rail network. Except for the 455-mile Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington, the 128-mile stretch from Los Angeles to San Diego and some intercity services out of Chicago, Amtrak has virtually given up to the airlines the travelers who must get from one part of the country to another in the most expeditious way. Yet long-haul travel is the real business of Amtrak, as the Government- subsidized National Railroad Passenger Corporation is known. It operates nearly all the long-distance passenger trains in the United States. In rebuilding intercity rail service from the shambles of the 1950's and 1960's when it all but collapsed under the pressure of airline competition, Amtrak has concentrated on wooing the leisure traveler. In brief, the idea it has been promoting is this: Suppose the trip from New York to San Francisco takes three days, think of all you can see if you have that much time to spend. Or if you can take even longer, you can visit a few major cities and national parks along the way.
1984-09-30	SOME SYSTEMS IMPROVED SINCE VERMONT RAIL CRASH	Amtrak and the Central Vermont Railway have improved their systems for weather reporting and communications since an Amtrak passenger train derailed in northern Vermont last July on tracks undermined by rain. But the chief investigator looking into the accident for the National Transportation Safety Board has questioned the adequacy of the Vermont line's weather monitoring system. Five people were killed and 149 injured July 7 when Amtrak's Montrealer, bound for Montreal from Washington, went off the tracks at Williston, Vt.
1984-08-08	2 Boys Die as Train Hits Car	Two teen-age boys were killed when an Amtrak train struck their car at a crossing after they drove past waiting vehicles and warning lights, the authorities said today. No one on the train, which was bound for Seattle from Chicago, was hurt in the accident in this northwestern Montana town Monday evening. The victims were identified as James M. Sapa and Raymond C. Johnsrud, both 16 years old and both from Columbia Falls.
1984-08-07	U.S. BEGINS INSPECTION OF PASSENGER RAIL LINES	After a rash of railroad accidents in the last month that took 11 lives, Federal officials today announced a special safety inspection of the busy Northeast rail corridor, which connects Washington, New York and Boston. John H. Riley, head of the Federal Railroad Administration, said he expected the inspection to ''tell us with certainty what we believe, that Amtrak is a safe system.'' W. Graham Claytor, the president of Amtrak, who joined Mr. Riley for the announcement, said, ''There are no unsafe conditions in the Washington-New York corridor.'' His comments and Mr. Riley's were the latest in a series of efforts by officials to maintain public confidence in Amtrak's passenger service despite the accidents.
1984-07-16	OFFICIALS CITE SAFETY CONCERNS AFTER TWO FATAL AMTRAK ACCIDENTS	Federal officials say the fatal train accidents this month in Vermont and South Carolina raise anew several longstanding questions about the safety practices of railroads that carry Amtrak passenger trains. The officials said that the two accidents were unrelated and did not reflect any sudden decline in safety standards. They said, however, that the accidents, which left three passengers and three crewmen dead, included circumstances present in previous rail mishaps. Three passengers and two crew members were killed July 7 when an Amtrak train derailed after heavy rains had washed out the track bed near Williston, Vt. On July 12, a train crew member and the driver of a diesel tank truck were killed when a train struck the tanker a a crossing without signals near McBee, S.C.
1984-07-12	2 ARE KILLED	An Amtrak passenger train crashed into a gasoline truck at a crossing early today and the truck exploded and burned, the authorities said. Two people were killed and five others were injured. It was the third fatal Amtrak crash in a week.
1984-07-09	TRAIN WRECK LAID TO VERMONT RAINS	A train wreck that left five people dead and 153 injured was apparently caused by heavy rains that washed out an old stone culvert and then undermined an earth embankment over which the train ran, a Federal official said today. Patricia A. Goldman, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that this finding was the ''preliminary'' result of a Federal investigation into the crash of a Montreal-bound Amtrak train that derailed and plunged into a gully near here early Saturday. Miss Goldman said it was the nation's worst train accident since six people were killed in a crash in Virginia in 1979. The Burlington area had four to six inches of rain Friday night, state officials reported, closing several local roads and opening large fissures on the side of the road closest to the accident site. One road, just across the Winooski River from the wreck, also had a culvert collapse, and a car fell into a creek in Underhill, 10 miles away, when rain washed away a country road.
1984-07-09	'AMAZING' COORDINATION CITED IN SAVING TRAIN RIDERS' LIVES	''Extraordinary'' coordination among rescuers and hospital workers carrying out a local plan for coping with disasters was credited today by a Federal official with saving lives when an Amtrak passenger train derailed Saturday morning. Rescue efforts after the derailment, which killed five people and injured 153, were compounded by difficulties in getting an estimated 300 workers and equipment to the remote, hilly area where the train crashed in a ravine. Helicopters were also used by rescue teams. ''The coordination of this rescue was an extraordinary effort,'' said Patricia A. Goldman, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, who arrived on the scene from Washington Saturday afternoon. ''The dynamics of every disaster differ, but I can say this: Their work and their cooperation with one another saved lives out there. I would even say it was amazing.''
1984-07-08	TRAPPED VICTIM FEARED IT WOULD BE A 'LIFETIME'	Judith A. Loriaux was on her way with four friends from Washington to Montreal early this morning for a bicycling trip when their Amtrak passenger train derailed. The 42-year-old woman was trapped in her sleeping compartment for about the next seven hours. ''Them not knowing that we were down there - that was the scariest thing,'' she said later. ''It didn't seem like seven hours. I thought it was going to be a lifetime.''
1984-07-08	3 KILLED AS TRAIN FALLS INTO RAVINE IN VERMONT HILLS	An Amtrak passenger train with 278 people aboard derailed while crossing a washed-out culvert this morning, killing at least three people, injuring more than a hundred and trapping passengers in a crushed sleeping car. The train was bound from Washington to Montreal. Officials said tonight that two people were believed to be still inside the sleeping car, which overturned in a shallow pool of water. Rescue workers using blowtorches and a crane continued searching for survivors late into the night. Eighty-eight people were taken to the Medical Center Hospital in Burlington; 57 others were taken to the Fanny Allen Hospital in Winooski. About 140 people who were unhurt or suffered only slight injuries were taken by bus to the Williston Armory. Most of the injured were treated and released.
1984-06-09	AMTRAK TRAIN DERAILS IN PHILADELPHIA, INJURING 36	Six cars of an Amtrak train bound from Boston to Washington derailed in southwest Philadelphia this afternoon, causing three dozen minor injuries, the authorities said. The derailment occurred at 2:40 P.M., 10 minutes after the nine-car passenger train, No. 169, left 30th Street Station.
1984-03-16	ONE KILLED AND SCORES HURT	Amtrak's westbound Empire Builder was struck today by a loaded gravel truck that a train attendant said ''tried to beat'' the train past a crossing. The authorities said the truck driver was killed and scores of the train's passengers injured, 10 critically. ''There were people moaning and screaming,'' said John Tormanen, a passenger from Dassel, Minn., who escaped injury. ''It was quite a mess.''
1984-03-07	Amtrak Equipment Failures Cited in Carolina Derailment	A bad bearing and a broken axle on a locomotive were blamed today in the derailment of Amtrak's Silver Star passenger train Monday. In the accident, which took place while the train was going 79 mils an hour, 51 of the 269 people aboard were injured. Seaboard Systems, which operates the train for Amtrak, said investigators had found that an axle on the last of the three engines had snapped.
1984-02-28	A SKETCH ISSUED OF MAN SOUGHT IN RAIL SHOOTING	The police released an artist's sketch yesterday of a man wanted for questioning in the shooting of an Amtrak engineer in Pennsylvania Station last week. The sketch was distributed as 30 detectives pressed the hunt for the gunman, believed to be responsible for six shootings in the area since April. Police Inspector Robert F. Burke said the person being sought - a 25- year-old black man about 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 165 pounds - was not ''necessarily a suspect.''
1984-02-22	ENGINEER SHOT AT PENN STATION IN 6TH SNIPING	An Amtrak engineer was shot in the head by an unidentified assailant yesterday morning on a Long Island Rail Road platform in Pennsylvania Station. The police said it was the sixth related shooting since last April, either in the station or in nearby buildings. No suspect has been apprehended in any of the six cases, nor has any motive been established for the shootings, according to the police. The engineer, Richard Russo, 29 years old, was reported in critical condition early this morning at Bellevue Hospital, where he had been in surgery for more than 15 hours. The other shooting victims have recovered.
1984-02-10	The Curbside Hustle	Jack and Marie Mansfield, visitors to the New York area from Washington state, took a train from a New Jersey suburb to Penn Station recently and then needed to take a cab uptown about 25 blocks. A young man clutching a fistful of dollar bills accosted them, asked where they were going and hailed them a cab. As he swept open the door, Mr. Mansfield offered a $1 tip.

1983-11-13	4 REPORTED DEAD AS TRAIN JUMPS TRACKS IN TEXAS	Four people were reported killed and at least 91 were injured this morning when an 11-car Amtrak passenger train derailed nine miles north of this East Texas city. Most of the injured were released after treatment at hospitals here, but three people were listed in critical condition late today. The bodies of four women were pulled from the wreckage, according to the authorities. United Press International reported tonight that one victim had been identified as Dorothy Blask, 77 years old, of Dallas, but the other names were being withheld pending notification of relatives.
1983-10-02	TRAINS KILL 2 AMTRAK WORKERS	Two workers were killed and another is presumed dead after two separate accidents early yesterday in which trains slammed into members of track crews in Kearny, N.J., and in Newark, officials said. Diane Elliott, an Amtrak spokesman, said that an Amtrak train crossing the Portals Bridge in Kearny at about 12:10 A.M. yesterday hit two men working on the tracks.
1983-09-10	A POWER FAILURE AT PENN STATION HALTS 40 TRAINS	More than 40 trains and 32,000 New Jersey commuters and intercity riders were delayed up to three hours through the rush period last night when a power failure halted Amtrak and N.J. Transit rail service into and out of Pennsylvania Station. The Long Island Rail Road was unaffected by the disruption, the most extensive since last spring when a monthlong trainmen's strike halted N.J. Transit service for 70,000 commuters. The effort to unsnarl backlogged trains extended delays for some riders late into the evening, but service was expected to be back to normal today, rail officials said.
1983-09-07	AMTRAK'S STRATEGY FOR NEW AUTO TRAIN	Amtrak, the federally subsidized national passenger railroad system, thinks it can succeed where private enterprise did not. On Oct. 30, it will revive Auto Train service between Lorton, Va., outside Washington, and Sanford, Fla., near Orlando. Three years ago, the privately financed Auto Train Corporation filed for Chapter 11 protection under Federal bankruptcy law after providing a similar service for nearly 10 years, and went out of business eight months later. Analysts have attributed the company's failure to insufficient capitalization, an overambitious management and bad luck, including two derailments.
1983-08-26	TROUBLES PLAGUE TRAIN TO NEW YORK	An Amtrak train bound for New York derailed in North Carolina yesterday, injuring 21 passengers, after two earlier accidents that left one person dead. The train, the Silver Meteor, left Miami with 413 passengers at 9:04 A.M. Wednesday. It struck and killed a woman fishing from a railroad trestle in Georgia about 7:40 P.M. Then, nearly two hours later, it slammed into a pickup truck abandoned on the tracks in South Carolina. Nearly four hours later, with a new engineer, the train struck a disabled tractor-trailer truck, causing two locomotives and two baggage cars to derail.
