2010-11-28	A 2nd Sticker For the Leaf	Two federal agencies say they know how far the new Nissan Leaf will go on a fully charged battery. They just don't agree. A few weeks before the Nissan Leaf is delivered to buyers, the Environmental Protection Agency, which approves the fuel economy stickers that go in the window of every new car, says it will go 73 miles. The Federal Trade Commission says the correct number is 96 to 110.

2007-05-27	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2007 Nissan Altima; The Pace Picks Up As Act 4 Begins	BACK in 2001, Nissan badly needed a hit to revive its floundering business in North America, and the Altima delivered. The third-generation Altima, transformed from a dowdy, unloved compact into a sleek midsize sedan with sporty handling, brought younger customers to Nissan showrooms and gave the carmaker a serious competitor to the mighty Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Nissan's recent woes, a dip in sales and profits, is hardly the sort of crisis that confronted the company six years ago. But Nissan is again turning to the Altima to refresh its image. While the fourth-generation car isn't as big a leap as the third, this redesigned 2007 model gives Nissan a bit of needed sizzle in the crowded market for midsize, midprice front-wheel-drive sedans.

The plant in Kanagawa makes subcompacts like the March, and the Tochigi plant builds Skyline sedans and other vehicles.

2006-03-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Volvo to Buy Nissan Stake	Volvo A.B., Europe's largest truck maker, plans to buy 13 percent of Japan's smallest maker of commercial vehicles from Nissan Motor, in an effort to increase sales in Japan, China and Southeast Asia. Volvo will pay 1.5 billion Swedish kronor ($193 million) cash for 40 million Nissan Diesel Motor shares, becoming its largest investor. Volvo also has a four-year option to buy Nissan's remaining 6 percent stake in Nissan Diesel. The deal enables Nissan, Volvo and Nissan Diesel to cooperate on commercial vehicles with Dongfeng Motor, China's third-largest assembler, and to challenge DaimlerChrysler, which plans to start making trucks in Beijing this year.
2006-03-09	Nissan Set To Relocate; A Sales Chief Will Retire	The Nissan Motor Company said Wednesday that its top North American sales executive was retiring, the highest-level employee to leave as the company prepares to move its American headquarters from Southern California to Tennessee. At the same time, two of the closest associates of Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, were promoted to top positions in its North American operations. It was a sign that Mr. Ghosn, who took responsibility for Nissan's North American operations in 2005, wants his lieutenants in charge.
2006-02-19	Editors' Note	An article on Feb. 5 about changes in the American auto market contrasted its two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford, with the next four -- Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. It said that while those four were expected to have a combined worldwide profit of $22 billion for 2005, G.M. and Ford together had a loss of $6.6 billion worldwide. The article should have noted that G.M. reported a loss of $8.6 billion while Ford reported an overall profit of $2 billion, although Ford lost $1.6 billion from its North American auto operations.

2006-02-05	Carmakers' Big Idea: Think Small	THE writer E. F. Schumacher would be proud. Across the automobile market in America, there is an evolving realization that small is beautiful. No longer do the industry's two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, dominate the industry -- not in profits, sales or buzz. The hottest action is now taking place among the next four companies: Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, and the Japanese automakers Toyota, Honda and Nissan.
2006-01-14	SATURDAY INTERVIEW -- With Carlos Ghosn; What Detroit Could Learn From Nissan	As General Motors tries to fix itself, Kirk Kerkorian's adviser, Jerome B. York, had one suggestion this week: imitate Nissan. The chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, has led Nissan through two successive turnaround plans, and is now in his third growth plan, making him the auto industry's version of a rock star. Last year, Nissan reached two of the goals Mr. Ghosn set: selling one million cars in the United States and increasing global sales by one million.
2006-01-11	Kerkorian Aide Tells G.M. to Be More Like Nissan	Ten years ago, Jerome B. York came to Detroit on Kirk Kerkorian's behalf to deliver marching orders to Chrysler. On Tuesday, General Motors' turnaround efforts became the subject of Mr. York's attention. As G.M.'s past and present chief financial officers looked on, Mr. York said G.M. needed to cut its dividend in half; reduce the pay of directors, top managers, salaried staff members and hourly workers; issue clear and specific financial goals; and operate as if its survival were at stake.
2006-01-09	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; Nissan Thinks Outside the Xbox	FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield.
2005-11-22	G.M. SET TO DROP 5,000 MORE JOBS AND SHUT PLANTS	General Motors, the world's largest auto company, announced details on Monday of a three-year blueprint to revive its fortunes, including 5,000 job cuts on top of 25,000 previously announced. Analysts immediately questioned whether the plan was enough, saying it lacked the speed and breadth that had helped rivals make comebacks. Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said the jobs cuts along with plant closings were ''necessary for G.M. to get its costs in line with our major global competitors.''
2005-11-19	Nissan's Mr. Fix-It Is the Talk of Detroit	Carlos Ghosn, one of the world's smoothest car pitchmen, skipped a beat. ''That is very flattering,'' he said Thursday night, stalling for time after learning that auto analysts in Detroit told reporters this week that he, the man who turned around the Nissan Motor Company, would be the dream manager to turn around General Motors. ''It is better to be cited this way than the other way around, that this is a guy you need to avoid.''
2005-11-07	Minivans Safer With Side Air Bags	A new method of crash-testing minivans showed that Honda, Nissan and Toyota models are among the safest when struck by a sport utility vehicle or a pickup truck, according to a report released Sunday. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety assessed the safety of six minivans by simulating a crash in which an S.U.V. or a pickup truck slammed into the side of the minivan at 31 miles an hour. The tests involved only new models that were not going to be redesigned by the manufacturer in the near future.
2005-10-04	Big S.U.V.'s Lag in Sales, Hindered By Gas Cost	The heyday of the giant sport utility vehicle keeps moving farther away as gasoline prices loom larger. In September, industrywide sales of large S.U.V.'s were down 43 percent from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. That is particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which are dependent on truck-based S.U.V.'s.
2005-09-07	Toyota Hopes to Push Its Hybrids Beyond the Niche	With Hurricane Katrina pushing American gas prices above $3 a gallon at the pump, Toyota Motor may find itself in the right place at the right time, with a new, half-mile assembly line capable of producing gasoline-electric hybrid Prius cars at the rate of one a minute. The line, in a factory in Toyota City, is part of a strategy by Japan's largest company to expand hybrids from a niche in the marketplace (just 5 percent of its American sales now) to mainstream (25 percent of its sales by 2010).
2005-08-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse; Out of the Darkness, A Flash of Color	AN eclipse occurs when one celestial body obscures the view of another, just as the redesigned 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse has begun to overshadow the previous-generation car, a coupe that some sporting enthusiasts never fully embraced. Mitsubishi hopes the new Eclipse will also obscure the company's troubled reputation, a result of dismal financial results, corporate scandals in Japan and the United States and an exodus of top executives.
2005-07-27	Nissan Sales Climb 12%, Helped by Demand in U.S.	Nissan Motor, the No.2 automaker in Japan, reported robust sales growth in its most recent quarter, helped by strong demand in the United States despite an aggressive sales campaign by General Motors. While one-time charges hurt net profit in the three months ended June 30, Nissan said it was still on course to post its highest profit ever in the fiscal year ending in March. That would be the company's sixth consecutive year of record profits.
2005-06-26	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Infiniti M35 and M45; The Japanese Take the Driver's Seat	IN the late 1980's, Japanese automakers established upscale divisions with a clear mission: to challenge German supremacy in luxury automobiles. Japan's threat proved real and its fancier cars were generally good, yet BMW and Mercedes-Benz still maintained their dominance, in perception if not always in reality, for most of the last 15 years. The tables may have turned. The plush Lexus LS430, from Toyota, has edged out big German cruisers in comparison tests, not only by Consumer Reports but by some enthusiast publications. Now the turnabout seems to be occurring among midrange sport sedans, where Japan's charge is led by the Infiniti division of Nissan.
2005-06-20	'Kill Bill' Did It. 'Lost in Translation' Did, Too. Now Mitsubishi Plays Up Japan's Hip Factor.	TOYOTA, Nissan and Hyundai can't seem to stop talking about how American they are. Not Mitsubishi; it wants you to know the red diamonds in its logo are as red as the rising sun. Complete with booming Japanese taiko drums and cars that bow in the customary Japanese show of respect, Mitsubishi's new advertising campaign for the Eclipse sports coupe tries to sell the company's Asian lineage.
2005-06-02	Sales Off Again at Ford and G.M; 2 Foreign Rivals Up	Even though General Motors and Ford Motor continued to have difficulty selling cars, they did narrow their losses last month. Toyota and Nissan, meanwhile, continued to post healthy sales gains. For the industry, sales of cars and trucks in the United States were down slightly, to about 1.5 million vehicles. According to Wards AutoInfo Bank, Americans bought 0.3 percent fewer vehicles than they did last May.
2005-05-04	Ford and G.M. Suffer as Buyers Shun S.U.V.'s	The latest automobile sales figures show that Americans are increasingly wary of gas-thirsty sport utility vehicles. That was particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which both saw their sales slip last month as consumers continued their steady march into Asian car companies' dealerships. Both Toyota and Nissan posted record sales gains in April, which helped push overall auto sales in North America up 1.8 percent.
2005-05-03	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Vehicle Sales Rise	Sales of cars, trucks and buses in Japan rose 11 percent in April from the same month last year, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. The increase was led by Japan's two largest carmakers, the Toyota Motor Corporation, up 14 percent, and the Nissan Motor Company, up 20 percent. The total, which excluded minivehicles, rose to 262,983 vehicles, the association said.
2005-04-25	Small Increase in Full-Year Profit Is Expected at Nissan	The Nissan Motor Company will post a small increase on Monday in its net profit for the recent fiscal year, a result of big gains in the sales of its vehicles in the United States and China, company officials said Sunday. Nissan's income rose 1.7 percent, to a record 512.3 billion yen ($4.8 billion) in the year ended March 31, from 503.7 billion yen a year earlier. The company cited strong sales of its luxury Infiniti sedans and an expanded line of light trucks. The results were slightly above Nissan's forecast for a profit of 510 billion yen.
2005-04-10	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier; Those Baby Pickups Are Grown Up and Ready to Move Out	FOR years, while the Detroit-based automakers groomed their cash cows, the full-size pickups and S.U.V.'s that generated much of their sales revenue, Japanese companies concentrated on cars. By the time the Americans turned their attention back to automobiles -- Ford called 2004 ''the year of the car'' -- the Japanese were deploying new trucks in their assault on Fortress Detroit. Now that both Toyota and Nissan have established a toehold in full-size pickups, the companies have set their sights on the single most neglected sector of the automotive market: pickups that aren't truly large but have clearly outgrown their old ''compact'' label. Sales of less than full-size trucks have fallen by a quarter since 2000, to around 670,000 last year, partly because the offerings have been rather drab and outmoded.
2005-04-02	U.S. Automakers Lose Ground to Rivals	Auto sales perked up in March, though domestic carmakers continued to lose ground to foreign competitors. Sales at General Motors fell 1.5 percent and were down 4.9 percent at Ford Motor from the month a year earlier, while Nissan Motor reported a 12.6 percent increase, the first time the company had sold more than 100,000 cars and trucks in the United States in a month.
2005-03-27	Land of the Rising Gaijin Chief Executive	THE choice of Sir Howard Stringer as the first foreign chief executive of Sony affirms what appears to be the new conventional wisdom in Japan: When a company really needs a shake-up, it calls in a gaijin, or foreigner. Japanese executives, the logic goes, are career men -- and they are almost always men -- more interested in preserving the status quo than in rocking the boat. In a nation that reveres harmony, at least on the surface, breaking new ground is a long and convoluted process. As outsiders, foreign executives are unhampered by the numbing complexity of interpersonal relationships, making it easier for them to act as change agents without worrying about offending colleagues or losing their jobs.
2005-03-25	My Life, My Nissan Maxima	WHO -- Mari Ellis, 42, an office manager in Oviedo, Fla. WHAT -- 2004 Nissan Maxima 3.5 SE I've always been the independent type. At 15 I got a job as a ticket taker at Disney World because I wanted my own money. The park was about an hour from my house, and I had to car pool there and back. Driving equaled freedom, so I couldn't wait to get my driver's license. Thirty-five years later, I've learned how precious that freedom really is, especially when your dream car is involved.
2005-03-24	Architecture and Carchitecture	THIS is a week of ''reveals,'' as the auto industry calls its introductions of new models at events like the New York International Auto Show, which opens tomorrow at the Javits Convention Center. Last week Nissan Motor offered an early teaser. Two in fact: it unveiled a new sport concept car against the backdrop of a new design studio in Farmington Hills, Mich.
2005-03-19	Honda Tries to Spruce Up a Stodgy Image	At last month's Chicago Auto Show, the Honda Motor Company offered reporters a sneak preview of a Civic coupe. The car will not be available for sale until the fall, however, and for Honda executives that cannot come soon enough. A look at recent sales figures for the current Civic shows why. After slumping 9.3 percent in January from a year earlier, Civic sales in the United States plummeted 34 percent in February, compared with February 2004. And analysts say sales of the vehicle, Honda's second-most popular after the Accord, could continue to slide through the summer.
2005-03-17	G.M. SEES A LOSS NEAR $1 BILLION; STOCK FALLS 14%	General Motors' stock fell to its lowest level in more than a decade Wednesday after the company said it expected to post a loss of nearly $1 billion for the last six months. The news set off G.M.'s largest single-day share loss since the market collapse of 1987 and further darkened Wall Street assessments of the company, the world's largest automaker. The losses reflected an increasingly harsh reality: that General Motors, which three years ago was thought to be the healthiest of the Big Three automakers in Detroit, is now considered the weakest, primarily because it is not selling enough cars at home. The losses also raised questions about the strategy of the company's chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner.
2005-03-02	G.M. and Ford Lose Ground In Sales Again	The gears of the domestic auto industry are grinding again, with shares of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company trading near one-year lows and the companies continuing to lose customers. Sales at G.M. fell 12.6 percent in February from the same month a year earlier, according to monthly sales reports released by automakers on Tuesday; Ford's sales fell 2.8 percent. Both companies scaled back the numbers of cars and trucks they planned to make as unsold models accumulate on dealer lots, though G.M.'s cut were deeper and it is showing few signs of a turnaround.
2005-02-22	Nissan Names Executive To No. 2 Job	Nissan Motor named a longtime company executive to the No.2 position on Monday as its chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, prepared to take on the task of leading two major automakers at once. Nissan named Toshiyuki Shiga, 51, chief operating officer starting in April, a month before Mr. Ghosn is to begin the daunting job of running one of the largest carmakers in Japan while also leading one of the largest in Europe, the French carmaker Renault.
2005-02-05	Honda Urges Toughening Of Fuel-Economy Rules	Honda Motor urged the federal government on Friday to impose tougher fuel- economy regulations, an unheard- of request from an automaker. The request was meant as a gesture to environmental groups after the Thursday decision by Honda and Nissan to join an industry lawsuit against California, which is seeking to regulate the emissions from cars and trucks of gases that are said to worsen global warming. Most other automakers have already sued the state to block what would be the first such effort in the nation.
2005-02-02	In a Tough Month for Autos, Ford Takes the Biggest Fall	Month after month, Detroit continues to lose American customers to Asian competitors. Last month, it was the Ford Motor Company that lost the most, with sales falling 4.9 percent in January compared with the same month a year earlier, Ward's AutoInfoBank reported Tuesday. And financial analysts are beginning to worry about the sales pace of some of Ford's new products.
2005-01-26	World Briefing | Africa: Malawi: Judges End Strike Over Cars	The 26 High Court and Supreme Court judges who went on strike last week for new cars to replace their 10-year-old Toyota Corollas, agreed to end their action after the government promised them a fleet of Nissan Terranos, a court official said. The judges, who originally demanded Mercedes-Benz cars or BMW's and later Toyota Prados, settled for the relatively cheaper Terranos ''after lengthy deliberation,'' the official said.
2005-01-18	Simul-Chief: Nissan Executive May Run Renault, Too	Carlos Ghosn has moved to a shorter workday. Instead of running from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. -- a schedule that the Japanese press calls ''7-11'' -- the chief executive of Nissan Motor has cut back to a mere 14 hours or so a day. ''I'm trying to take a little bit more care,'' he says. ''I'm saving energy that I need for the future.''
2005-01-05	3 Japanese Carmakers Gain Against Big 3 in the U.S.	For Japanese automakers, last year brought feast or famine in the United States. Toyota, Honda and Nissan's American sales continued to surge in December, according to figures released Tuesday by the automakers, as the companies made further inroads against the Big Three domestic manufacturers, particularly General Motors and Ford Motor.
2004-12-24	Steel Shortage Squeezes Asia's Manufacturers	It has been a long time since Japan has experienced shortages of any kind. So it came as something of a surprise last month when Nissan Motor was forced to briefly suspend much of its production because it could not get hold of enough steel. Since then, Suzuki Motor has said a lack of steel would force it, too, to shut down assembly lines for a few days this month, and to reduce production from January to March. Even the giant Toyota Motor said Thursday that it has had to make adjustments in the kind of steel it buys to ensure steady supplies.
2004-12-08	Automakers Sue to Block Emissions Law In California	Toyota, General Motors and seven other automakers filed suit on Tuesday to block California's new greenhouse gas regulation, which was approved by the state in its final form in September. The suit sets up a battle between automakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Although Mr. Schwarzenegger is a fan of the Hummer, an S.U.V. with prodigious greenhouse gas emissions, he has promised nonetheless to defend the regulation, which was signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis.
2004-12-03	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Steel Shortage At Carmaker	Nissan Motor may have to curb vehicle production again in March, after a temporary plant closing this month, because of a shortage of steel, the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said. In total, Nissan may be forced to reduce its production by as many as 40,000 vehicles because of the tight steel supplies, a loss that would reduce the company's profit by as much as 16 billion yen ($155 million), Mr. Ghosn said. Nissan has not been able to get enough steel because of higher-than-expected sales of some of its cars and because strong demand in China has left many steel makers with little capacity to raise output. Mr. Ghosn predicted that other Japanese automakers might also face shortages in March, typically the peak month for auto production in Japan. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-11-26	Nissan to Halt Auto Output At 3 Plants in Japan for 5 Days	The Nissan Motor Company said Thursday that a shortage of steel would force it to temporarily halt production at three of four of its auto factories in Japan, an unusual step made necessary in part by a surge in demand for steel in China. Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker, said it would suspend work at the plants for five days starting at the end of this month, a move that will reduce its output by some 25,000 vehicles. The carmaker plans to make up for the setback by increasing production early next year and said it did not expect the temporary shutdown to hurt its profits much.
2004-10-24	Wheel Is Turning Against S.U.V.'s	ABOUT once a month, without fail, as Bryan Feery drives his Hummer around Glastonbury, somebody holds up a hand as he passes by. The person isn't waving. ''Oh absolutely, I get the finger from people,'' he said.
2004-10-03	Kindred Spirits (One of Them Winks)	YOU can gas on all you like about the number of cylinders, the size of the engine or the kind of fuel injection under the hood. A car is, in its soul, just an outfit with wheels. ''It's what you wear,'' the British industrial designer Ron Arad said. ''An extension of your personality.''
2004-10-02	Car Sales Up 5.6% in Month, With G.M. and Toyota in Lead	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent in September from last year, with General Motors and Toyota posting double-digit gains, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The strong September, which came after a disappointing August, was indicative of the roller coaster trend the industry, in particular the domestic automakers, has encountered for several months. Often, a sluggish sales month has been followed by a big surge as automakers come back with higher cash and financing incentives and more inventive marketing programs.
2004-08-27	Sure, It's Pragmatic. But Stylish? The Minivan Is Getting a Makeover	Julie Blewitt once vowed she would never own a minivan. ''I grew up humiliated being chauffeured about in a wood-paneled station wagon,'' said Ms. Blewitt, 34, of Loveland, Colo. ''I swore I would never drive the modern-day equivalent.'' But a couple of children can dent such resolve. Earlier this summer, she and her husband competed at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan in the Minivan Summer Games, part of a promotion by DaimlerChrysler, in the auto industry's latest attempt to cast off the minivan's dowdy image.
2004-07-30	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Profit Rises	Nissan Motor said yesterday that net income in its second quarter rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier to 123.2 billion yen ($1.1 billion) amid growing sales of pickups and other light trucks in the United States. Nissan's revenue for the quarter rose 15.4 percent, to 1.91 trillion yen. Nissan has been gaining market share in the United States after introducing its first full-sized pickup truck, the Titan, and a range of other new or redesigned light trucks. Nissan's worldwide sales volume rose 9.9 percent, to 769,000 vehicles. The announcement was Nissan's first quarterly earnings report. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-07-28	Study Says Blacks Paid More for Honda Loans	A new study has found that black customers are almost twice as likely as whites to be charged a marked-up rate when they finance a purchase through the loan subsidiary of Honda Motor, and that on average, blacks are charged higher markups than whites. The study, covering nearly 400,000 people who borrowed from the American Honda Finance Corporation from June 1999 to March 2003, was conducted by Mark Cohen, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits against several automakers. His research has been at the center of those cases.
2004-07-11	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Toyota Sienna and Nissan Quest; All Grown Up, but Still Playing With Children	THE modern minivan turns 21 this year, and nearly every automaker in the van market is marking this passage into adulthood with an all-new or significantly revamped version of this quintessential family vehicle. No longer is the minivan a short, boxy, frumpy appliance on wheels. It has evolved into a long, rounded, slightly less frumpy appliance on wheels.
2004-05-30	What's New Under the Sun This Summer; Nissan 350Z Roadster	YOU can forgive a multitude of vehicular sins if the top is down, the sun is shining and the wind is having its way with your hairstyle. When topless, even a battered Renault Alliance seems to purr like a sex kitten. Of course, tops stay up most of the time, especially in this part of the country, so shouldn't one test a convertible that way? This I did, not by choice but because a wintry storm front accompanied me, and a Nissan 350Z roadster, on what was intended to be a top-down springtime weekend in Massachusetts.
2004-05-23	Don't Look Back; Infiniti Does It for You	WHILE there are many differences between the Nissan Armada and the Infiniti QX56, three stand out: The Nissan's 5.6-liter engine has been reconfigured a bit to develop slightly more horsepower in the Infiniti (315 compared with 305) and a tad more torque.
2004-05-23	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Nissan Armada and Infiniti QX56; The Bus Stops Here (and, Often, at the Pump)	THE neighborhood association met recently to discuss the usual complexities of suburban life, like trash pickups and leaf collection, and inevitably the talk got around to dropoffs and pickups at the elementary school. The narrow old streets around the school have become crowded and potentially dangerous. It can be frightening to behold mothers one-handing their sport utilities while clutching their cellphones -- illegally, in New York State -- especially when you consider their less than ideal vision to the rear and sides of their rigs.
2004-05-06	FORD AND CHRYSLER RAISE LIGHT TRUCK INCENTIVES	Ford and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have increased incentives on light trucks after Toyota and Nissan gained market share last month. Ford is offering $1,000 and no-interest 60-month loans on Explorer sport utility vehicles, Excursion and Expedition S.U.V.'s and Freestar minivans, a spokesman, Jim Cain, said. Chrysler added $2,000 to incentives on the Durango sport utility, to a total $3,500, a spokesman, Kevin McCormick, said. General Motors has offered similar incentives since April 1. The American automakers' share of the light truck market in the first four months of this year slid to 71.9 percent from 73.8 percent a year earlier.
2004-04-27	Nissan Profit Up as Luxury Models Sell Well	The Nissan Motor Company on Monday posted a small gain in net profit for the fiscal year that just ended, as strong sales in the United States of its luxury Infiniti line and other Nissan vehicles helped offset the damage caused by a rising yen. Nissan's net income for the year ended March 31 was 503.7 billion yen ($4.63 billion), up 1.7 percent from 495.2 billion yen in the period a year earlier, because of robust sales of the Infiniti G35 and the Altima sedans and the introduction of vehicles, like the Murano crossover sport utility vehicle, in segments where Nissan did not compete before.
2004-04-19	Struck in Side, Many Cars Fare Poorly In Safety Test	The results are in from the first consumer test of how passenger cars fare when struck in the side by sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. And they are not good. Ten of 13 midsize car models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group financed by car insurers, received the lowest of four possible ratings, indicating a likelihood of serious or fatal injury. The tests also showed that women were at disproportionate risk in truck-car side-impact collisions.
2004-04-06	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Raises Thai Stakes	The Nissan Motor Company will pay $190 million to gain controlling stakes in two companies that manufacture and sell Nissans in Thailand. Hoping to increase sales and profits in the fast growing Thai market, Nissan said it would raise its stakes in the Siam Nissan Automobile Company, a manufacturer and distributor of Nissan vehicles, and the Siam Motors and Nissan Company, a vehicle assembler, to 75 percent from 25 percent. Nissan's move to take control of the operations follows a year in which sales of Nissan vehicles sank 1.8 percent in Thailand while the overall vehicle sales expanded by 30 percent. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-03-09	No New Trial for Mother Convicted in Suicide	The Meriden, Conn., woman who was convicted last year of risking injury to a minor after her 12-year-old son committed suicide is not entitled to a new trial or acquittal, a judge ruled Monday. In October, a lawyer for the woman, Judith Scruggs, complained that comments made by one juror, Vincent Giardina, after the verdict were grounds for a mistrial.
2004-02-04	Incentives and New S.U.V. Help Chrysler Bolster Sales	By offering incentives worth more than $1,000 and a range of new sport utility models, the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler and several Japanese automakers racked up sales gains in January even as General Motors and the Ford Motor Company posted declines. Chrysler said its sales increased 9 percent last month compared with the corresponding month in 2003 after adjusting for one extra selling day this January. Including Mercedes, sales for DaimlerChrysler over all rose 7.7 percent, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich.
2004-01-31	G.M. Nears Settlement In Lawsuit Over Lending	General Motors is close to becoming the second automaker to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that the industry's lending practices let car dealers discriminate against blacks and other minorities when they set loan rates. Lawyers representing tens of thousands of African-American car buyers have reached a tentative settlement with the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the financial services division of G.M., both sides said Friday.
2004-01-25	Personal Business; What to Expect When You're Expecting a Mini-Cooper	WHEN snow fell on Philadelphia last month, John P. Meyers, a local lawyer, posted a note on a Web message board for Mini Cooper owners, asking if his new car would handle slick and snowy roads. No problem, the owners told him. But Mr. Meyers, 44, wasn't really an owner yet. His Mini Cooper S was being assembled thousands of miles away, at a factory near Oxford, England. In fact, it would be six more weeks before Mr. Meyers first set eyes on his car and tested it on a snowy January day.
2004-01-18	Growth Trend: Big Pickups	TOYOTA does not have a flashing sign at the Detroit auto show telling the hometown companies to watch out. Instead, it has a bold, brash, oversize blue pickup called the FTX, a design study that sends a clear message to the competition: Toyota's next big truck will be, yes, big. Company executives conceded that the FTX, with a pugnacious grille wearing a thick crown of chrome, hints at the size and look of their next-generation Tundra, to begin production in 2006. Until this year, when Toyota introduced its larger-all-around Tundra Double Cab, its largest pickup fell short of rivals from Detroit's Big Three.
2004-01-18	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Nissan Titan; From the Birthplace of Godzilla, Japan's First Monster Truck	PICKUP trucks bearing Japanese nameplates are nothing new in the United States. Nissan started selling such a truck, the Datsun 1000, in 1959. But for decades, while the Japan-based auto companies wedged a toe into the passenger car market -- followed by a foot, an arm and a couple of legs -- they confined their pickup efforts mostly to small, inexpensive, relatively economical models. Detroit's Big Three had the full-size truck market, with its remarkably loyal customers, locked up.
2003-12-26	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Overseas Auto Output Rises	Domestic vehicle production for Japan's 12 automakers fell 3.5 percent in November, data showed yesterday, while exports from the country fell 4.2 percent. But overseas output, led by Nissan Motor and Mazda Motor, posted gains on surging demand in Europe and the United States. Nissan raised overseas output 23 percent; Mazda said production abroad increased 20 percent. The increase was 12 percent at Toyota and 5.5 percent at Honda. Mitsubishi was the only one of the top five with a drop, as production abroad fell 36 percent.
2003-11-25	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Aims To Double China Sales	The Nissan Motor Company and its partner in China, the DongFeng Motor Corporation, said they hoped to more than double the number of cars sold by 2007. The companies, which started making cars in July, aim to sell 620,000 cars by 2007, up from an estimated 300,000 this year. Revenue from the sale is expected to be $9.6 billion, while operating profit margins are seen rising to 10 percent of sales, from 8 percent this year. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-11-15	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Automaker Upgrade Possible	Moody's Investors Service is considering upgrading the credit ratings of Nissan Motor. Moody's, which now rates Nissan's credit at Baa3, cited improved cash flow and more efficient operations. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-11-14	Challenging Detroit's Redoubt, Nissan Starts Up the Titan Pickup Truck	Nissan's new pickup truck, the Titan, has been debated and dissected all year long. Now it is priced and ready to go out the showroom door. The basic version of the Titan, the first full-size pickup truck from a Japanese company to challenge Detroit's last solid sales bastion, will start at $22,400, officials of the Nissan Motor Company said yesterday.
2003-11-06	Under an audacious campaign, the chatter before the movie starts might just be about a Nissan.	After walking through the fourth wall, the advertiser can begin its pitch. NISSAN MOTOR is planting actors in movie theaters to perform live commercials before the start of showings of ''The Matrix Revolutions'' in an effort to expose jaded, skeptical consumers to advertising by masking it as something else. The brief in-person pitches feature actors scattered among the ticket-buying audience who stand and deliver lines that evoke the words spoken by poets at events known as slams or jams. Their performances are timed to accompany a commercial the audience sees on the movie screen, which begins without identifying the sponsor but concludes with the Nissan Altima logo.
2003-10-22	Mitsubishi Falters as Other Makers Thrive	While Toyota, Honda and Nissan prosper, Mitsubishi continues to stumble. Mitsubishi's credit rating was cut two notches on Tuesday, to further below investment grade by Standard & Poor's, which cited the company's weak sales in the United States and losses on its consumer loans.
2003-10-16	Nissan to Post Decline in Half-Year Profit	The Nissan Motor Company will post a decline in net profits for the half-year ended in September because of one-time events, but the company still expects to match last year's record profit in this fiscal year, a Nissan executive said on Wednesday. The company, which will release its preliminary earnings report on Thursday in Tokyo, also expects its sales to grow worldwide, and every major region to be profitable.
2003-10-12	Business People; Pickups and Popcorn On the Pacific	The big Nissan Titan pickup truck doesn't go on sale until late this year, but it's already hauling home honors. Last week, Edmunds.com, a Web site based in Santa Monica, Calif., that offers car-shopping advice to consumers, named it the most significant vehicle of 2004, as the first full-sized pickup from a foreign company to challenge Detroit's hold on the truck market.
2003-10-07	People	Jeff Huggins was named executive vice president and co-chief creative officer at the San Francisco office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. He will share the top creative duties with Kevin Moehlenkamp, executive vice president, who had been the sole chief creative officer. Mr. Huggins was senior partner and executive creative director at the San Francisco office of J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group. McCann-Erickson is part of the McCann-Erickson WorldGroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. John Brockenbrough was named executive creative director at the Winston-Salem, N.C., office of Mullen, succeeding Denzil Strickland, who left, the agency said. Mr. Brockenbrough had been a partner at Bare, Chicago, and before that worked at agencies like Leo Burnett Worldwide, Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mullen is part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
2003-10-02	Buyers Cash In on Offers to Keep Car Sales Strong	September auto sales slowed from August but continued to show strength, surprising analysts. Customers took advantage of the latest price war. Last month, General Motors was giving away Dell computers to Saturn buyers, in addition to the usual offer of zero-percent financing and big rebates that were heaviest on remaining 2003 models.
2003-09-21	For Infiniti G35, Luxury Begins With Nissan's Z-Car Platform	TESTED: 2003 Infiniti G35 Coupe WHAT IS IT? An upgraded version of the Nissan 350Z HOW MUCH? $29,795 base, including $545 shipping charge; $34,565 as tested, including six-speed manual transmission, leather upholstery, heated front seats and outside mirrors, 225-watt Bose audio system and power sliding sunroof. WHAT MOVES IT? Front engine, rear drive; 3.5-liter V-6 engine (280 horsepower and 270 pounds-feet of torque; five-speed shiftable automatic or six-speed manual transmission. HOW FAST? 0-60 m.p.h. in 5.8 seconds; quarter-mile run in 14.2 seconds; 60-to-0 braking in 112 feet (as tested by Motor Trend magazine). HOW THIRSTY? E.P.A. mileage rating: 19 city, 26 highway (automatic); 20 city, 27 highway (manual). SAFETY FEATURES: Eight air bags (2 front, 2 side, 4 head), 3-point safety belts and head restraints for all 4 passengers; engine immobilizing antitheft system; antilock brakes; traction control; stability control; emergency brake assist. ALTERNATIVES: Acura CL ($31,050); BMW 3-Series ($30,295); Mercedes-Benz C230 ($25,670). If you like the Nissan 350Z sports car but can't live with just two seats, Infiniti has an answer: its G35 Coupe offers just a little more than the Z-car: more seating, more elegance, more practicality and, it's true, more dollars on the monthly payment checks.
2003-09-14	More Than Meets the Eye	LIKE many manufacturing businesses these days, the auto industry is largely about getting the biggest bang for a buck (or yen, or euro). And the resurgent Nissan Motor Company, which was running on pocket change and i.o.u.'s a few years ago, is hardly an exception. Just two vehicle platforms -- one rear drive, and one front drive -- underpin a bevy of its new family sedans, sport sedans, the Murano sport utility ''crossover'' and the Quest minivan. The Nissan 350Z sports car rides on the same foundation as the Infiniti G35 coupe and sedan.
2003-08-17	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Nissan Murano and 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor; Autos in S.U.V. Costumes	IF, in fact, the S.U.V. was ever a vehicle dedicated to delivering the attributes of sport and utility, the concept would seem laughably naïve today to the M.B.A.'s who hold sway in the marketing departments of automakers. No, to succeed in 2003 these do-all vehicles had better be prepared to make a lifestyle statement about the driver, haul young couples to trendy restaurants and add just the right finishing touch to suburban driveways, all without giving up the ability to swallow a mountain of groceries and forge through snowdrifts. As a result, there is a constant quest to find new ways to slice the S.U.V. baloney ever thinner. From the go-anywhere roots of the Jeep Cherokee, arguably the modern-day originator of the sport utility vehicle, to the battlefield-ready profile of the Hummer H2, the S.U.V. has branched out to embrace all sorts of buyers: those who demand a full measure of luxury appointments, those who occasionally need a small pickup bed, even the unfathomable segment who crave an off-roader with blistering 0-to-60 acceleration.
2003-08-01	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Sales Grow	The Nissan Motor Company said yesterday that it sold 700,215 cars from April to June, a 2.7 percent increase from the period a year earlier. The company, which is Japan's third-largest carmaker, said car sales brought in 1.65 trillion yen ($13.6 billion). Sales in Japan fell, while volume in the United States and Europe grew. The company left its full-year forecasts unchanged and still expects to earn a 495 billion yen ($4.1 billion) profit. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-07-25	In Europe, Profits Are Painfully Low For Auto Industry	A wintry chill has settled over Europe's automobile industry this summer, as DaimlerChrysler of Germany and Peugeot of France reported sharply lower profits today, while investors prepared for a bleak earnings report expected from Volkswagen on Friday. Renault managed to post an increase in profits, thanks to buoyant results at Nissan Motor, in which it has a 44 percent stake. But the fact that France's second-largest carmaker depended on its Japanese partner to salvage its numbers underscores the ills afflicting Europe's industry.
2003-07-18	Via Madison Ave., a Secular Synagogue	Funny, it doesn't look like 63003 77th Street. The line between religious and secular life has grown a little bit blurrier with the starring appearance of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue in magazine advertisements for the Infiniti Q45 automobile.
2003-07-18	Minivan Magic	Foldaway third-row seats that disappear under the floor have become de rigueur for the newest minivans and S.U.V.'s. The new Nissan Quest is the first minivan to take this a step further by making the second row of bucket-style seats fold flat into the floor. Among other things, this disappearing act clears the entire rear of the minivan for cargo when both the second and third rows are folded flush with the floor. With both rows of seats in the lowered position, the Quest's clear floor can accommodate a 4-by-8-foot sheet of plywood. The second-row folding seats do this trick in stages. First, the seat back is folded forward. Then the whole seat assembly rocks forward and downward until the carpeted seat back is flush with the rest of the floor and merges with the rear floor area.
2003-07-13	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Nissan Maxima; A Promotion and a Raise	NOT long ago, Nissan had few models worth a second look, no money to redesign its fleet and a horde of rivals circling for the kill. Today, the competition is stronger than ever. But thanks to the cash and management talent lavished on the company by its adoptive parent, the French automaker Renault, both Nissan and its premium brand, Infiniti, are back in the fight. The company now fields a classy sports car (350Z), a sport sedan-sport coupe duo (the Infiniti G35's), hot utility wagons (Nissan Murano and Infiniti FX) and a striking minivan (2004 Quest). In the works are two big S.U.V.'s (Pathfinder Armada and Infiniti QX56) and a monster truck (Titan). Amid this product blitz, Nissan is also trying to rekindle enthusiasm for its midsize Maxima sedan, whose onetime niche has been invaded by the grown-up, spiffed-up Altima.
2003-07-09	American Cars Show Gains In a Survey of Dependability	Mercedes-Benz has fallen behind its sister brand Chrysler in a closely watched report on vehicle dependability, while General Motors has surged. And Japanese vehicles continue, over all, to hold up the best. The report, issued today by J. D. Power & Associates, focuses on problems that arise over three years of ownership. Its rankings are important because most consumers say a vehicle's reputation for long-term durability is their top consideration in buying.
2003-07-02	4% Rise in Auto Sales in June Fuels Optimism at the Big Three	Nationwide auto sales rose in June, but the domestic industry continued to lose ground to foreign competitors like Toyota despite spending heavily on consumer purchase incentives. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company were upbeat in conference calls today, though, saying that they saw positive signs for industry sales in the second half of the year.
2003-05-25	Chic? Sexy? Is Japan Really Talking Minivans?	EVEN in the darkened room, her face obscured in shadows from the camera, the woman being questioned clearly seemed uncomfortable. Squirming in her seat, a sense of shame in her voice, she whispered, ''I drive an M-I-N-I-V-A-N.'' The mock inquisition, shown by Nissan at the Detroit auto show in January to dramatize the introduction of its new Quest, summed up the stigma that society has placed on minivans. Compared with more chic choices, like sport utility vehicles, minivans are viewed as boring, condemned to be driven by sexless soccer moms toting rows of tots.
2003-05-25	For Nissan, a New Plant and Ambitious Goals in the U.S.	IT'S hard for locals to miss the new $1.43 billion Nissan plant in Canton, Miss. The plant, at 2.5 million square feet, sprawls alongside Interstate 55, about 20 miles north of Jackson, with bright red letters declaring the company name to drivers traveling by. The main plant, which will open formally on Tuesday, will produce the newly designed Quest, the full-size Titan pickup truck, the big Titan Armada sport utility vehicle and another big S.U.V. for Nissan's Infiniti luxury division. Once a one-million-square-foot expansion is complete, the complex will also produce the Altima sedan, bringing the total number of models built there to five and its annual production capacity to 400,000 vehicles.
2003-05-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Profit At Nissan	Nissan Motor, the carmaker, said its profit rose to a record in the fiscal year that ended March 31, confirming forecasts. Nissan said profit rose 33 percent, to 495 billion yen ($4.24 billion), because of cost-cutting measures and demand for the company's new models. Sales rose 10 percent. Nissan expects profits to remain at current levels this year. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-05-02	A Tough Act to Follow: His Own	What, Carlos Ghosn asks himself these days, can he do for an encore? As chief executive of Nissan Motor, Mr. Ghosn has already engineered one of the most spectacular turnarounds in Japanese corporate history. And he still has about two years before he is to move to Paris to run Nissan's parent, Renault. The challenge he faces now is how to make Nissan even stronger in the meantime.
2003-05-02	Auto Sales Dropped 6.1% During April	Auto sales for April improved on a sluggish first quarter, receiving a modest bump from a renewed incentive push by the Big Three, but were still below the strong levels of a year ago. ''When one considers the heavy incentives for the month, the sales levels are quite disappointing,'' said Domenic D. Martilotti, an analyst for Bear, Stearns. ''Each iteration of this zero-percent-for-60-months push, there are clearly diminishing returns. So the question is, where do we go from here?''
2003-04-25	It's New. It's Hip. It's a Nissan?	SHIRO NAKAMURA, the chief of design for Nissan, plays classical music on a cello and jazz on a bass. His tastes run from Bach to Bill Evans, and in each genre he finds different ways to express himself. ''Jazz is innovation, creating advanced music; classical is more established,'' he said last week at the New York International Auto Show. ''It's the same in cars. How do you balance the two things? You must find the best path between the classicalness and the newness.''
2003-04-23	Nissan Is Set to Report Another Solid Year	Nissan Motor will announce record profit for the third consecutive year on Wednesday, as cutbacks and a new lineup of cars offset stiffer competition in the United States. Despite a slowing global market, Nissan, Japan's third-largest automaker, said it expected more gains this year. The numbers are an indication of Nissan's revival under Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive. It now has some of the best operating margins in the industry worldwide and is also the best-performing stock among large carmakers. This comes just four years after Nissan lost $5.6 billion, in its sixth loss in seven years.
2003-04-19	Cloaked in Green, But Pushing Trucks	As the Ford Motor Company scaled back expectations this week for its first hybrid-powered vehicle and backpedaled on a pledge to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles, Toyota was introducing its latest Prius, which will get about 55 miles a gallon and be the first midsize vehicle with hybrid technology. For environmentalists, the contrasting developments reinforced the sense that only foreign carmakers care about curbing America's swelling appetite for oil. ''The Japanese are where you go if you want good technology, and Detroit is where you go if you don't,'' said Daniel Becker, the top global warming expert at the Sierra Club.
2003-03-18	Chairman and Finance Officer Leaving Nissan in a Shake-Up	Nissan Motor shook up its executive ranks today, announcing that its chairman and its chief financial officer would step down later this year. The company said that Carlos Ghosn, chief executive and president of Nissan, would add co-chairman to his duties, and that Itaru Koeda, executive vice president for purchasing, would also become a co-chairman.
2003-03-06	California Offers Change In Car Rules	California is seeking to compromise with automakers by dropping a requirement that they sell electric cars, the state's latest attempt to persuade carmakers to end their opposition to the program. The California Air Resources Board outlined proposed changes to the zero-emission vehicle program today that would let companies sell more gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell autos instead of battery-powered cars starting with 2005 models, a spokesman, Dimitri Stanich, said.
2003-03-02	THE WHEEL/2004 Infiniti FX45; The Shape of Things to Come	''PLATFORM engineering'' insert yawn here -- is an auto industry term of art for sharing major substructures and systems among different vehicles, and even among different brands. The Lincoln LS, Jaguar S-Type and Ford Thunderbird all have the same basic Ford Motor Company anatomy, for instance. As bland as the term sounds, carmakers shy away from it, for it conveys a hint of on-the-cheap expedience and mix-and-match design. Yet Nissan is on the verge of raising platform engineering to an art form. Five vehicles are based on the company's FM architecture, an abbreviation for the engine's front-mid position: the Nissan 350ZX sports car and Murano ''crossover'' wagon, the G35 sedan and coupe from the Infiniti luxury division, and now the FX45, which you could safely call a crossover something.
2003-02-21	Nissan Settles Bias Suit by Minority Buyers	The finance unit of Nissan Motor has reached a tentative settlement with black and Hispanic car buyers who said that the company discriminated against minority customers by charging them higher interest rates. Under the terms of the settlement, the carmaker's finance unit, the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, will offer preapproved loans to hundreds of thousands of current and potential black and Hispanic Nissan owners, and will limit how much it raises the interest charged to car buyers above the company's minimum acceptable rate. The finance unit will also contribute $1 million to America Saves, a nonprofit program that tries to help low-income people save and build wealth.
2003-02-18	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Debt Rating Raised	Standard & Poor's has raised the credit rating of the Nissan Motor Company, citing the automaker's strong profits and balance sheet. Nissan debt is now rated BBB/A-2, an improvement of one notch. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-02-09	N-I-S-S-A-N: Rah! Rah! Rah!	READING David Magee's study of Carlos Ghosn, the cost-killing executive who famously turned around the Nissan Motor Company, there is a certain temptation to ask: Who gets the most out of books like this, the reader, the writer or the subject? Certainly in the book, titled ''Turnaround: How Carlos Ghosn Rescued Nissan'' (HarperBusiness, $25.95), even the most charitable or disinterested outsider cannot but be struck by the procession of gratuitous superlatives that seem so cloying as to raise another question: Can it really be that there was no downside at all to this apparently remarkable achievement or the man behind it?
2003-01-07	Rugged Rubber Bumpers à la Honda	They work as furiously as any Indy pit crew. In white jumpsuits and green baseball caps, the 10-man cleanup team arrives seconds after a tiny lime green Fit and a midsize four-door Legend smash into each other at about 30 miles an hour. Hubcaps are retrieved, broken glass swept up and computers plugged into the cars' data boxes. This is Honda's crash test center, one of the world's most advanced. The lab the size of a dozen football fields is at the forefront of Honda's efforts to reinvent itself as a safety leader -- the Volvo of Japan.
2002-12-03	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Car Sales Rise	New automobile registrations, a crucial indicator of consumer spending, rose 6.6 percent in November from a year ago, the third consecutive monthly gain. Japan's largest automaker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, said sales rose 11 percent after it introduced new models. Sales at the Nissan Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company rose more than 7 percent each. Sales at the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, which is 37 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler, fell 16 percent. Over all, Japan's new-car market has not returned to the levels it had achieved before the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-10-23	Big Turnaround at Nissan Leads to Record Profits	Thanks to strong sales of Altima and Infiniti cars and progress in cutting costs, Nissan Motor will announce record profits today for the six months ended Sept. 30. The automaker will also raise its profit forecast for the year and consider paying shareholders a dividend for the first time in four years, the company said. The strong results extend a remarkable turnaround for Nissan, Japan's No. 3 carmaker, which just a few years ago was buried in debt and nearly bankrupt. The latest period will be the fifth consecutive half-year of rising earnings.
2002-09-19	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan In China Deal	Nissan Motor will spend as much as $1 billion to form a venture with Dongfeng Motor in China. Nissan's president, Carlos Ghosn, will reportedly sign an agreement in Beijing this week that gives it a 50 percent share of the new venture. Japanese news media reported that Nissan planned to make 150,000 cars annually in China beginning in 2004. In the last several months, Nissan's rivals, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, have announced plans to make cars in China. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-09-08	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Nissan 350Z; Fast Forward: Greatest 'Z' Hits, Vol. 5	IT'S hard to measure anticipation in exact terms, but even so, it's pretty clear that the resurrection of the Nissan Z-car is generating more buzz than just about anything else on the new-car horizon. Buzz, of course, is not always rooted in substance. So the real issue is how well this sexy sequel measures up to its storied predecessors. Is this just a wan reflection of a cool original, like the Chevy Malibu? A shameless attempt to capitalize on a famous name, like the 1989-93 Pontiac LeMans? Or is this Z the real deal?
2002-08-28	Many Marketers Will Forgo Ads During Sept. 11	Two weeks before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a consensus seems to be emerging about advertising on that day: less will be more. Most marketers, agencies and media companies are deciding that they would rather go adless or limit their advertising than risk being perceived as exploiting the day for mercenary purposes.
2002-08-26	Nissan hopes to upend expectations in its new campaign, 'Shift.'	NISSANS are still being driven, but Nissan is no longer ''Driven.'' Confused? Nissan North America is hoping you won't be after an ambitious and somewhat ethereal campaign gets under way next week that changes the company's four-year-old brand theme of ''Driven'' to ''Shift.''
2002-08-18	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Infiniti G35; Checkup for Infiniti: Yes, There's a Pulse	NISSAN'S Infiniti division is full of surprises. For years it was surprising how indifferent its cars could be: the last generation of its Q45 flagship, with fey styling and forgettable personality, or the I35, an overdressed Nissan Maxima sent in to spar with all-stars like the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. The success of rivals like Lexus (Toyota) and Acura (Honda) made Infiniti's aimlessness all the more notable. But last year -- surprise! -- Infiniti started to get things right. The latest Q45 is powerful and luxurious, and whatever it lacks in lively handling it makes up for with high ''T'' scores -- toys and technology -- offering voice-recognition controls, a rear-view video camera and a dynamic cruise control that adjusts the speed to the flow of traffic.
2002-08-16	Ready for My Backup	Twisting, stretching and the most masterful use of mirrors still leave blind spots for the driver backing up. So why not a video monitor putting the rear view up front? Nissan has introduced the first such system, but it's still a luxury item, part of an $8,000 package of extras in the Infiniti Q45, a $50,000 car. A tiny camera, mounted near the rear license plate, is linked to a seven-inch video screen -- the same one used for the navigation system -- on the center dashboard of the car. When the driver shifts into reverse, the cameras go on and the screen shows, in black and white, what's behind the car. Three colored bars on the display tell approximately how far the back of the car is from hitting something: green means 7 to 10 feet away; yellow, 3; and red, 1.5 feet. Shift into drive and the view disappears.
2002-08-01	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan To Make More Cars	The Nissan Motor Company says it will increase production up to 20 percent in Japan as it expands its new car lineup and tries to increase market share. Nissan Motor said it planned to make an additional 300,000 cars in Japan by 2005. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-07-30	Auto Companies Make Assignments	Two automotive advertisers made decisions on assignments for advertising aimed at multicultural consumers. Both reviews have prompted criticism from activists like the Rev. Al Sharpton. The Chrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., part of DaimlerChrysler, retained GlobalHue in Southfield, Mich., which is 49 percent owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, as the agency handling its multicultural marketing.
2002-06-14	G.M. Beat Ford in Efficiency, A Study of Auto Plants Finds	Last year, for the first time since a closely watched study began tracking productivity, General Motors was more efficient than the Ford Motor Company in building cars. But both companies, along with DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, continue to trail Asian competitors in productivity and profitability. The gap remains wide, even though the three major Asian automakers -- Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan -- slipped a bit last year.
2002-05-31	G.M. Rises and Nissan Falls in J.D. Power Quality Survey	General Motors rose to third place in this year's quality ranking surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, the best performance for a domestic manufacturer since the study's methodology was changed in 1998. The Ford Motor Company also rose in the closely watched initial quality survey, which examines how cars perform in their first 90 days, as did DaimlerChrysler, the parent of the Chrysler Group. Ford moved from seventh place to fifth in the survey. DaimlerChrysler moved from fifth to fourth.
2002-05-29	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: More Autos Built	Japan's five largest automakers increased production at their plants overseas last month to meet growing demand in North America and elsewhere and to take advantage of lower costs. The Toyota Motor Corporation, the country's largest carmaker, increased production overseas by 37 percent in April, while Nissan raised output 23 percent. The Honda Motor Company, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and the Mazda Motor Corporation also raised production. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-05-21	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Posts a Profit	Helped by cost-cutting and the weakness of Japan's currency, the Nissan Motor Company earned 372 billion yen ($2.95 billion) in the year that ended March 31. The automaker, which was near bankruptcy in 1998, has also cut its debt sharply and increased its operating margins. The company, which is 44.4 percent owned by Renault S.A., expects its profit to rise another 2.2 percent this year and sales to increase 4.9 percent. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-05-14	Good Times For Toyota, But It Faces More Rivalry	Is Toyota Motor peaking? The results the company announced today for the year ended March 31 certainly scale new heights, with record sales, operating profit and net income reported, despite a slowing of growth after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The company's forecast for the year that began April 1 is for more smashed records.
2002-05-10	Nissan Turns Attention to Its Vehicles	Having taken Nissan Motor from near bankruptcy to record profits in three years, the company's president, Carlos Ghosn, laid out a strategic plan for the company today that he said would elevate it ''from a good company to a great company.'' Since he arrived from Renault, Nissan's largest shareholder, in 1999, Mr. Ghosn has made himself Japan's most famous corporate turnaround artist by attacking Nissan's costs with a most un-Japanese ferocity, shutting factories, slashing supply chains and laying off thousands of workers.
2002-05-05	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Dodge Neon R/T and Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V; For Grownups Who Haven't Outgrown Hot Wheels	HOW do automakers make loyal customers of the young, selling them their first cars and transporting them through life in vehicles that keep pace with their growing incomes and evolving self-images? Loyalty is not so easily won anymore -- long gone are the days when General Motors could expect Chevy owners to graduate to Olds and Buick as their paychecks grew. But in a rapidly evolving market where nobody's share is secure, carmakers still hatch plots to entice the young. These days, those strategies often include a sport-tuned version of a conventional compact car that costs less than $20,000. Nissan and DaimlerChrysler are no exception, and their entries suggest how much value the industry must deliver to keep a foot in the door:
2002-05-02	Auto Sales Increased 2.9% in April; Only Ford Lagged	Every major automaker except Ford Motor reported sales increases last month, evidence of an economic recovery that helped propel the stock market today. Over all, automobile sales in the United States rose 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
2002-04-11	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Introduces Minicar	The Nissan Motor Company introduced its first minicar as it tries to capitalize on the Japanese penchant for fuel-efficient, cheap and easy-to-park cars. The Suzuki Motor Corporation will build the new car called the Moco, using the Nissan brand, and Carlos Ghosn, the president of Nissan, has said he had hopes of winning 2.8 percent of the market for minivehicles. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-03-28	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Loss Widens At Sirius	Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. reported a wider loss yesterday, but also said that it would roll out its subscription service on July 1, a month ahead of schedule and that it had set a deal with Nissan. Shares in the company rose 63 cents, or 14.2 percent, to $5.06. The company said its fourth-quarter loss was $83.6 million, or $1.52 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $54.1 million, or $1.28. Nissan North America said yesterday that the Sirius satellite radio systems would be available in some 2003 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles starting later this year. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
2002-03-27	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Exports Jump	Leading automakers increased their exports to North America last month. Exports were helped by a weak yen, the introduction of several new models and the economic recovery in the United States. Toyota Motor shipped 21.8 percent more cars to the United States, while exports by Nissan Motor rose 23.9 percent. Exports by Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda rose even faster. But domestic auto sales slipped for most companies. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-03-24	The Cars That Car Designers Like to Look at	IF you want to rub elbows with automobile designers, there's no place like a car show to see the men and women who shaped the look and feel of the car in your driveway. But what do the designers themselves look at when they stroll the exhibition hall? The New York International Auto Show opens to the public on Friday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Earlier in the week, industry movers and shakers (and more than a few designers) will be on hand to unveil their latest dream cars (and real cars) to the press.
2002-03-01	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Renault To Raise Stake In Nissan	The French automaker Renault will bolster its stake in the Nissan Motor Company to 44.4 percent, from 36.8 percent, one year earlier than it had planned under an agreement reached in 1999. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-02-20	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Expects Record Profits	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's third-largest carmaker, will post record profits for the second straight year, according to its president, Carlos Ghosn. The company, which was near bankruptcy in 1999 before Renault took a one-third stake, said last May that it expected to earn 330 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in the fiscal year ending this March, just below the record profit produced in fiscal year 2000. Mr. Ghosn, however, said he expected to beat that mark this year. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-01-28	State Lures Good Jobs, but Companies Worry About Workers	When Mississippi won the great economic prize of 2000 -- the billion-dollar Nissan truck factory now rising like a white plateau along the interstate north of town -- few people wanted to discuss publicly the state's most serious shortcoming. Could it really find enough skilled workers to fill Nissan's 4,000 high-paying jobs? It was a bit delicate to say out loud, but Nissan had sharp questions for state officials about Mississippi's lack of experience in high-tech manufacturing, and its traditionally poor educational record. Publicly, the company proclaimed its faith in the state's strong work ethic, but privately it got state government to pay $80 million to train its workers, as part of Mississippi's record-setting $300 million incentive package.
2002-01-04	Incentives Prop Up Sales but May Haunt Carmakers Later	Auto sales, propelled by low-cost financing, finished the year slightly below a record set in 2000, according to data released today. But expectations for 2002 are pessimistic because of the economy as well as the dent that the incentives have probably made in demand. Carmakers ended 2001 with sales of about 17.1 million vehicles, down slightly from the record 17.3 million in sales a year earlier. Few analysts expected such a strong performance last summer, when industry sales were lagging, and the Sept. 11 attacks all but halted showroom traffic.
2001-12-27	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Output Down	Four of Japan's five largest automakers reduced production in November as sales at home and in many export markets dried up. Toyota Motor, the world's third-largest carmaker, cut global production 4.6 percent, while Nissan Motor, Japan's No. 3 automaker, trimmed output 3.1 percent. Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda cut production more than 10 percent each. Only Honda Motor, helped by demand for its subcompacts and minivans in Japan, increased output. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-12-04	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan's Rating Raised	The ratings agency Moody's Investors Service raised the credit rating of the Nissan Motor Company to investment grade, rewarding the company, Japan's third-largest automaker, for cutting its debts. Nissan's credit is now rated Baa3, the lowest above junk status. Nissan's outstanding debt on Sept. 30 was 799 billion yen ($6.4 billion), down 16 percent from six months earlier. The company plans to slice another 6 percent off its debt in the half year that ends in March 2002. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-12-02	A Superhero for Nissan	CARLOS GHOSN'S nickname -- Le Cost Killer -- preceded his arrival in Japan in 1999, with the daunting assignment of reviving Nissan. Since then, he has returned the company to profitability, closed plants and slashed debt, and his decisive actions have made him a corporate hero to many Japanese. The extent of their veneration has become clear with the serialization of his life story in a manga, one of Japan's popular comic books for adults. As first reported in Automotive News, Mr. Ghosn's comic biography is being presented over five issues of Big Comic Superior, widely read by salaryman as they commute.
2001-12-02	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Nissan Altima; Putting Some New Zip Into Family Activities	MODERATELY priced midsize sedans, still the cornerstone of most automakers' product lines, are roomier, safer and more reliable than ever. All most of them lack is a sense of excitement, and that, I suspect, partly explains why so many young families have migrated to sport utilities. But in a market in which manufacturers must scramble for every tenth of a point of market share, many seem oblivious to customers who need sensible transportation but crave an occasional thrill. Nissan has just claimed this niche for the Altima.
2001-11-20	World Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan's Profit Grows	The Nissan Motor Company posted record profits for the third consecutive half-year, benefiting from a weaker yen and cost-cutting. Nissan earned a net 230.3 billion yen ($1.87 billion) in the six months ended Sept. 30, up 34 percent from the period a year earlier. The company said it cut costs by 101 billion yen ($822 million) and was still on track to earn 330 billion yen ($2.68 billion) in the full year despite a 1.4 percent dip in sales. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-10-30	Nissan and Renault Are Said to Fortify Tie	Nissan Motor and Renault have reached a cross-shareholding agreement that will deepen their existing alliance, people close to the companies said today. An announcement of the pact is scheduled for Tuesday morning at Renault's headquarters in Paris, these people said.
2001-10-28	Anthrax Scare Trips Up Some Mail Campaigns	Many companies have altered their advertising campaigns to find an appropriate tone after the terror attacks. The anthrax scare has brought new challenges, especially for businesses that use direct mailings. Not everyone, though, has been able to react in time.
2001-10-23	Speaking the Language of Success	With attention focusing on Japan's car industry as the Tokyo Motor Show opens Wednesday, the man in the spotlight will be the president of the Nissan Motor Company, Carlos Ghosn, the foreign manager that Japanese love to love. Two years ago at the last auto show here, those attending heard Mr. Ghosn -- Brazilian-born, French-educated and American-experienced -- declare that he would save Nissan, Japan's No. 3 automaker, from bankruptcy. Last week he announced some preliminary results: half-year operating profits are up 39 percent, to a record $1.5 billion, and debt is down by $1.25 billion.
2001-10-21	Nissan Mailing Of Pill Bottles Is Ill-Timed	WHEN Michael Friedman opened his mailbox on Oct. 9, he found a lumpy white package. It had a clear return address, Nissan Information Headquarters in Fenton, Mo., but also, incongruously, the ''Rx '' symbol for a medical prescription. The postmark, from ZIP code 90746, was unfamiliar. He was, understandably, nervous. ''Just like everyone getting packages these days, we're absolutely nuts about it,'' he said. ''Always in the back of my mind these days, you think there might be something in there.''
2001-10-19	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nissan Expects Higher Profit	The second-largest automaker in Japan, the Nissan Motor Company, said that it expected to post a higher profit for the third consecutive six-month period. The company predicted that it would report a profit of 187 billion yen ($1.6 billion) in the period that ended Sept. 30; that is 39 percent higher than in the period a year earlier. The results, which would exceed analysts' expectations, were helped by a program to reduce purchasing costs. In addition, the weakness of Japan's currency helped offset a 3.8 percent decline in sales outside Japan, including a 14 percent slide in the United States, Nissan said. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-10-05	National Briefing | South: Mississippi: Governor Fires Economic Official	Gov. Ronnie Musgrove fired the director of the state's economic development agency, James C. Burns, who helped lure a $900 million Nissan assembly plant last year. Mr. Musgrove's decision came after Mr. Burns announced that he had filed for bankruptcy in the wake of divorce proceedings and accusations of racial bias in the handling of land purchases for the Nissan site.
2001-10-05	Big Loss at Nissan Seems to Undercut U.A.W. Objectives	The United Auto Workers thought that the Nissan workers in Smyrna, Tenn., would be the ones to finally unionize a foreign automaker's plant and provide a crucial first step in turning the U.A.W.'s fortunes around. Instead, the union was dealt a bitter defeat on Wednesday in a battle it had expected to win, or at least closely contest. The margin of defeat has surprised the auto industry and labor unions alike. Nissan employees rejected U.A.W. representation by a 2-to-1 vote, no better than in the union's failed attempt to organize the same plant in 1989.
2001-10-04	Union Is Subject of Vote At Nissan Tennessee Plants	Thousands of workers at a Nissan Motor factory in Smyrna, Tenn., began casting ballots yesterday to determine whether they would join the United Automobile Workers in the union's latest attempt to organize a plant operated by a foreign automaker. The ballots were being counted by the National Labor Relations Board, and results were expected last night.
2001-10-04	Nissan Workers Reject Bid To Join Union in Tennessee	The latest effort by the United Automobile Workers to organize a plant operated by a foreign automaker failed late last night in Smyrna, Tenn., as Nissan workers voted more than 2 to 1 to reject the union. The results were tallied by the National Labor Relations Board.
2001-09-10	Black Families Resist Mississippi Land Push	Like the bulldozers now flattening several square miles of central Mississippi, this state has allowed nothing to stop its effort to acquire a huge Nissan truck factory and finally take its place in the international economy. It outbid every other competing state for the plant with the largest package of tax-financed incentives ever offered to an automaker in the United States, estimated at more than $400 million in spending and tax rebates. As part of the package, Mississippi agreed to pay for an $80 million job-training program for Nissan workers and to build the factory's $17 million vehicle-preparation building. It promised $60 million in new and improved roads, to be built far faster than most state roads. It even allowed Nissan executives to use a state plane for several months.
2001-08-28	Most Japan Carmakers Report Gains in Global Production	Toyota Motor and Honda Motor led gains in global production among Japanese automakers in July as they raced to meet demand for new models at home and in the United States. Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, said global production rose 4.4 percent, to 439,020 vehicles, in July from July of last year.
2001-08-15	Union Moves To Hold Vote At Nissan Plant In Tennessee	The United Automobile Workers asked federal officials here today to hold a vote on unionization among workers at the giant Nissan factory in nearby Smyrna, Tenn., setting up the nation's first such election in a dozen years at a foreign-owned auto plant. If the union wins the vote, which is to be held within six to nine weeks, it would be a watershed in labor relations in the auto industry. The U.A.W. has never organized a foreign-owned assembly plant. The spread of these factories across the mostly nonunion South has eroded the union's power and put General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, which are unionized, at a competitive disadvantage.
2001-07-12	Nissan Says It Can Refute Report of Bias In Car Loans	The Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation yesterday released a report that it said ''strongly refuted'' two recent studies indicating that black customers had paid more than whites to finance cars through Nissan dealerships. The report, by a research firm hired by Nissan, said the earlier studies, by two professors hired by black consumers suing the Nissan finance corporation, or NMAC, ignored credit differences and variations in loan terms that might explain patterns in financing costs.
2001-07-08	A Car That Helped Redefine Datsun	IN 1969, driving enthusiasts who normally looked to Europe for sports cars found themselves beguiled by the 240Z, sold by a little-known company named Datsun. More than 30 years later, the 240Z is regarded as a landmark that helped establish Datsun (now known as Nissan) in America and proved the Japanese were serious competitors.
2001-07-08	Driving Vintage Models Can Cure Nostalgia	EVERYONE knows you can't turn back the clock, but that doesn't keep automakers from trying. With Ford's reborn Thunderbird due to arrive in dealerships later this summer, and with BMW's new Mini and Nissan's reincarnated Z car set to appear next year, it is easy to get all mushy about the past. There is, however, nothing like knocking off a few hundred miles in vintage transportation to gain some perspective on nostalgia.
2001-07-07	National Briefing | Washington: Investigation Sought On Auto Financing	Representative Harold Ford Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, has asked the House Financial Services Committee to investigate how the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation and other auto lenders treat black consumers. Mr. Ford said a Vanderbilt professor's study showing that blacks financing cars through Nissan dealers paid higher dealer-imposed finance costs than whites was disturbing. Like other lenders, the Nissan operation allows dealers to add extra points to the credit-based rate it sets for borrowers and to share in the resulting revenues. Diana B. Henriques (NYT)
2001-07-07	New Car, Old Racism	To the Editor: ''Review of Nissan Car Loans Finds That Blacks Pay More'' (front page, July 4) suggests to me that somehow, in some calculated methods, African-Americans are still victims of racism from corporate America.
2001-07-04	Review of Nissan Car Loans Finds That Blacks Pay More	A statistical study of more than 300,000 car loans arranged through Nissan dealers from March 1993 to last September -- believed by experts to be the largest pool of car loan data ever analyzed for racial patterns -- shows that black customers in 33 states consistently paid more than white customers, regardless of their credit histories. The gap between black and white borrowers was largest in Maryland and Wisconsin, where the average finance charge paid by blacks was about $800 higher than whites paid.
2001-06-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: More Autos	Nissan Motor said it planned to increase production in North America by 70 percent in the next three years to respond faster to market demand. Nissan, which is 37 percent owned by Renault of France, plans to produce a total of 1.15 million vehicles in North America by March 2004, up from the 680,000 units it made in the year to March 2001, a Nissan spokesman, Gerry Spahn, said. Nissan is setting up a plant in Canton, Miss., to build small pickup trucks starting in 2003. Production will also be raised by a third at its Mexico and Tennessee plants.
2001-06-07	The agency awards season is blooming with repeat winners -- and there's still more to come.	THE advertising awards season is nearing its peak as several organizations are about to present honors for effectiveness and creativity. And for those who go away empty-handed this time, there is word of new awards to come. Nissan North America and its agency, the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, won the top prize last night at the New York chapter of the American Marketing Association's 33rd annual Effie Awards, which recognize effectiveness in advertising.
2001-05-20	Private Sector; Imitating Mr. Ghosn in Japan	It was a Brazilian-born automotive executive from Renault named Carlos Ghosn who finally turned around Japan's Nissan Motor Company, which last week reported the biggest annual profit in its history after a staggering loss the year before. And because imitation is often the purest form of flattery in Japan, there is now speculation that other troubled Japanese companies may embrace a foreign chief like Mr. Ghosn.
2001-05-20	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Infiniti Q45; Once Again, a Q-Ship That Makes Waves	REMEMBER the Infiniti commercial with the rocks, the enigmatic voice-over -- and no vehicles in sight? The idea, back in 1989, was to stir interest in Nissan's new luxury-car line. But the Zen tease seemed to mystify as much as titillate. By the time Infiniti's flagship, the Q45, actually made an appearance, the marketing message was blurred. Auto magazines called the big, powerful luxury cruiser the Q-Ship, and they praised it for its nearly flawless finish and its superior road manners. But sales never came close to those of the Lexus LS 400, the Mercedes-like luxury car from Toyota that arrived at about the same time.
2001-05-20	Navigating the Navigation Aids	MY tipoff that the Infiniti Q45 isn't entirely comfortable with technology came even before it hit the road. As I closed the trunk, the hinges, which protrude nearly a foot into the cargo area -- in the low-budget style of a Korean econobox -- nearly crushed the laptop computer nestled atop the duffel bags, dirty laundry and provisions for the weekend house. The laptop survived, but more computer frustrations were in store. ''Can you imagine my father trying to use this radio?'' a passenger mused as I tried to wend through a maze of on-screen menus without plowing into approaching traffic. No, his famously impatient 70-something dad (who drives a Lexus) would not give the Q45's Vehicle Information System the attention it demands.
2001-05-18	Nissan's Head Says Revival Is a Success	Like a triumphant general reporting a sweeping victory, the president of Nissan Motor, Carlos Ghosn, announced his company's annual profits today and declared his 19-month revival plan for the company a great success. Emerging from a dark background onto a spacious stage flanked by two giant video screens, Mr. Ghosn told reporters at a news conference that Nissan had earned 331 billion yen ($2.70 billion), the largest net profit in its history, just a year after it had recorded a mountainous loss of 684 billion yen ($5.59 billion). Revenue in the period, which ended March 31, grew 1.9 percent, to 6.09 trillion yen ($49.74 billion).
2001-04-05	Pull Up a Car Seat and Make Yourself at Home	THE boxy white Nissan Chappo concept car could not have been more different from the other attention grabbers at the Geneva auto show in March: the sleek silver Aston Martin Vanquish, the Pininfarina Osée with its gull-wing doors and the 1001-horsepower Bugatti EB16-4 Veyron. The Chappo was designed not as a statement about speed but as a ''living room on wheels,'' said the new head of design at Nissan, Shiro Nakamura. New Yorkers will be able to size it up at the auto show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from April 14 to 22.
2001-03-04	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Nissan Frontier; Wearing Bulges, Hauling Bombast	IT isn't hard to spot a cultural trend in the hard-rocking commercials for the Nissan Frontier, especially the one in which the marketers get in your face with their assertion that the truck ''hauls gluteus maximus.'' This is the sort of male-oriented bluster that sells the World Wrestling Federation and the XFL, and, indeed, the Frontier comes with its own pads, cleats and face mask. The truck wears a nose of molded composite plastic around a blacked-out grille. The ready-to-rumble theme is underscored with a faux brush bar and oversized fender flares adorned with faux bolt heads -- proof that faux is a good thing only if you are talking about wallpaper.
2001-03-02	Vehicle Sales Held Strong Last Month	American consumers continued to flock to car dealerships in February despite the economic slowdown, producing another unexpectedly strong month for auto sales. Sales fell 6 percent last month from February 2000, but the year-earlier month had been one of the best in the industry's history because of lavish incentives. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.5 million vehicles, in an industry that considers anything above 16 million vehicles to be an excellent month.
2001-02-21	Bridgestone in New Recall of 98,000 Firestones	The Bridgestone Corporation said today that it was recalling about 98,000 Firestone-brand tires mounted mostly on Altima SE sedans because surface cracks on the edge of the tires could spread. Neither Nissan Motor, which makes Altimas, nor Firestone is aware of any accidents or injuries relating to problems with the Firehawk GTA-02 tires manufactured in Wilson, N.C. Nissan has not received any reports of tire tread separations or detachments. The recall is not related to Tokyo-based Bridgestone's earlier North American recall of about 6.5 million tires that are being investigated in connection with 174 deaths. The investigation has damaged the Firestone brand name and helped cut the value of Bridgestone's share by more than half.
2001-01-26	NISSAN PLANS BRITISH PLANT	The Nissan Motor Corporation said it would invest $:235 million (pounds)($342 million) in a manufacturing plant in Sunderland, England, to build the new Micra model. The decision comes on the heels of a $:40 million (pounds) aid package the British government promised Nissan if it would build the Micra in Britain. It also is in contrast to moves by other carmakers, like Ford and General Motors, which are closing British plants because of the strength of the pound against the euro. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)
2001-01-10	NISSAN TO FARM OUT SOME ASSEMBLY	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's third-largest auto maker, plans to cut costs by paying some of its parts suppliers to assemble certain components instead of doing the work itself. Starting in June, the Calsonic Kansei Corporation, in which Nissan holds a 32 percent stake, will send employees to a Nissan plant to set up and operate a factory line that will assemble most of a new- model sedan, leaving Nissan to add only six or seven components to complete the car. A spokesman said Nissan was considering doing the same thing with other new cars. Stephanie Strom
2001-01-04	Vehicle Sales Fell Sharply In December	Auto sales slowed precipitously last month, with domestic automakers reporting plunges of up to 18 percent from year-ago levels. Foreign automakers, though, escaped almost unscathed and gained market share. Ward's Automotive, an industry data service, calculated that overall sales fell 7.6 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million cars and light trucks.
2000-12-16	NISSAN EYES MINICAR MARKET	The Nissan Motor Corporation is considering various ways to participate in Japan's thriving minicar market, among them a proposal to market Nissan minicars through the Suzuki Motors Corporation. Minicars, with engine displacements smaller than 660 cubic centimeters, now account for one-third of all cars sold in recession-plagued Japan, but Nissan and its rival, the Toyota Motor Corporation, have both largely missed the trend so far, in part because they regarded profit margins on minicars as too small. Stephanie Strom (NYT)
2000-11-22	NISSAN TO AID RENAULT'S PROFITS MORE THAN EXPECTED	Renault S.A. said yesterday that profit from its Japanese partner, the Nissan Motor Company, would increase its second-half earnings by 453 million euros ($387 million), more than had previously been forecast, after Renault revised downward its expected tax bill and increased the amount it expects to earn from asset sales. Nissan is on course to earn a full-year profit for only the second time in the last nine years, after cutting its work force by 6 percent and trimming 10 percent from its component costs. Over all, analysts expect Renault to earn 1.07 billion euros this year, and Nissan's contribution would represent almost half of that. Renault owns 37 percent of Nissan.
2000-11-10	NISSAN SAYS ITS PLANT IN MISSISSIPPI WILL OPEN IN 2003	Nissan Motor said yesterday that a $930 million plant in Mississippi would start production in 2003, making pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans. Construction of the plant, near Canton, Miss., is scheduled to start in April. The plant will be able to produce 250,000 vehicles a year, employing 3,300 workers when it starts and 4,000 employees at full capacity, the company said. The Mississippi project is Nissan's first major new factory since it announced a three-year revival plan in October 1999. That plan came after Renault of France bought a 37 percent controlling stake in Nissan and installed Carlos Ghosn as Nissan's chief operating officer.
2000-11-09	NISSAN WILL BUILD A TRUCK PLANT IN MISSISSIPPI	The Nissan Motor Company will build a $900 million factory near Canton, Miss., to make pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. The cost and location of the factory were released yesterday in advance of a formal announcement planned for today in Jackson, Miss. North America is Nissan's largest market, accounting for about 30 percent of its sales; 25 percent of the company's sales come from Japan. The new plant is seen as a sign of Nissan's confidence that it has recovered from the financial problems that led it to seek help from Renault S.A., which took a 37 percent controlling stake in Nissan last year. The Mississippi factory will employ 3,000 to 4,000 people.
2000-11-07	MANUAL FOR FOOLING INSPECTORS	Nissan Motor of Japan gave its employees a manual telling workers to ''put away secret materials'' when government officials held surprise inspections, and ''to switch the computer screen to the one designed for inspection,'' an article in Yomiuri Shimbun reported. Nissan said the instructions were meant to apply only to materials that had not been completed and approved by a supervisor. Miki Tanikawa (NYT)
2000-11-02	U.S. Auto Sales Sag, Another Slowdown Sign	Not even aggressive discounting by automakers could lift sales of new cars and light trucks last month, and bloated inventories of unsold models have led to the closing for a week of 8 of the nation's 55 auto assembly plants. Auto sales are the first important economic indicator to come out at the beginning of each month, and today's results were another sign that growth in the American economy has been slowing somewhat recently. Although sales have leveled off at a high level by historical standards, they are increasingly being sustained by ever more generous rebates and low-rate loans, rather than by strong consumer demand.
2000-10-31	Nissan Reports Solid Profit For Half-Year	The Nissan Motor Company reported a solid half-year profit today, the first evidence of a turnaround in the carmaker's fortunes since Renault of France rescued it from insolvency last year. The company also more than quadrupled its projections for profits this year, sending a signal that it thinks recovery is just beginning.
2000-10-26	NISSAN SAID TO HAVE CHOSEN SITE OF SECOND PLANT	Nissan is moving closer to choosing a site for a second assembly plant in the United States, with The Birmingham News in Alabama reporting yesterday that the automaker had chosen Mississippi over Alabama. Nissan declined to comment. Nissan, which already builds midsized cars, pickups and sport utility vehicles in Smyrna, Tenn., has been looking for a place to assemble full-sized pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans. Like other foreign automakers, Nissan prefers to manufacture in the South, where the United Automobile Workers union has had limited success in organizing workers. Keith Bradsher (NYT)
2000-10-24	FORKLIFT MAKERS IN ALLIANCE	The Nissan Motor Company and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have agreed to an alliance aimed at improving the profitability and sales of their forklift businesses. In a move to bring down costs, the two Japanese companies will jointly develop forklifts and obtain parts for production and service needs. They will also manufacture forklifts for each other in hopes of expanding their customer base. Stephanie Strom
2000-10-22	NEW FRONT OPENS IN EFFORT TO FIGHT RACE BIAS IN LOANS	Two class-action lawsuits filed in Nashville against two of the nation's most prominent automobile finance companies have opened a critical new battlefront in government efforts to combat racial discrimination in the consumer credit markets. The cases, filed under seal two years ago but recently unsealed on motions by The New York Times and the ABC News program ''20/20,'' accuse the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation of participating in lending arrangements with car dealers that have resulted in blacks paying higher finance charges than whites on dealer-arranged loans for buying cars.
2000-10-12	The subject of divorce is becoming more common as another backdrop in campaigns.	DIVORCE is the kind of unhappy topic advertisers typically like to avoid. Yet in recent years, divorce has become just another backdrop in advertising as marketers recognize that millions of ''typical'' American couples have dissolved their marriages. Advertisers like Volvo, Nissan Motor, Ingka Holdings' Ikea, Volkswagen, and even Hallmark Cards have all used divorce in one way or another and usually with some poignancy.
2000-10-08	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2001 Nissan Pathfinder and Infiniti QX4; The Meek Inherit Some Muscle	WHEN Nissan Pathfinders roll off the slow boat from Japan, New York welcomes them with a hug. The Pathfinder is the most popular imported sport utility in the region; there seem to be at least a couple of them in every horn-blaring knot of congestion. Nissan's midsize S.U.V. is so common that it blends into the cityscape, like construction scaffolds and pedestrians who chat with themselves. But anything so familiar can become invisible, and it was easy to overlook the Pathfinder in recent years.
2000-10-08	What Price Luxury? A Pathfinder With $4,000 in Padding	IN the beginning, there were sport utility vehicles, and they were fun. The postwar Jeeps and Land Rovers, the International Scouts, the Ford Broncos -- you could drive them almost anywhere, or try to. And because they were rude and crude, the driver and passengers were very much part of the action. The whole point of luxury S.U.V.'s, however, is to keep the outside world at bay. These vehicles are plush, powerful, imposing and popular, but they are not much fun.
2000-09-12	U.S. Approves Formation of Supply Web Site for Automakers	Federal antitrust regulators approved today the establishment of an online venture that would allow five major automakers -- including the top three in America -- to buy supplies through a single Internet portal. The Federal Trade Commission approved the formation of Covisint, the business-to-business Web site, which proponents said would streamline the annual purchase of as much as $300 billion in parts for the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler A.G.
2000-08-30	TBWA and Hakuhodo Unify Work for Nissan	TBWA in New York and Hakuhodo in Tokyo said yesterday that they had formed a joint venture solely for worldwide advertising communications for the Nissan Motor Company in Tokyo. Billings for the worldwide account were estimated at more than $1 billion. The new venture, G1 Worldwide in Tokyo, is a result of a plan by Nissan announced last fall to consolidate advertising at one agency partner to create a coherent global brand message. Robert LePlae, 40, managing director at the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWAChiatDay, part of the TBWA unit of the Omnicom Group, where he oversaw the Nissan and Infiniti accounts, will lead worldwide operations at G1 as president and chief executive. Takashi Ohashi, a general manager at Hakuhodo, becomes chairman.
2000-08-11	Toyota Tells British Suppliers to Use Euros Instead of Pounds	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it had instructed British components suppliers to do business in euros instead of pounds. The move reflected the distress among automakers and other manufacturers here over the pound's high value relative to the euro, a situation that has made British exports to Europe expensive. This year, BMW of Germany pulled out of a six-year investment in the Rover Group of Britain, complaining that the pound's high value against the euro had hurt profits. The Ford Motor Company also cited the pound's strength against the euro in a decision to close a major assembly plant. The Nissan Motor Company of Japan has threatened to transfer production of a new subcompact from its plant in northeastern England. And Matsushita Electric Works of Japan has also warned it may close British plants.
2000-08-05	NISSAN SELLS DRIVE SHAFT MAKER	As part of its efforts to focus on the core business and reduce its heavy debts, the Nissan Motor Company will sell a unit that makes drive shafts for all of its domestic vehicles to GKN Japan Ltd., a subsidiary of GKN P.L.C. of Britain, a leading maker of automotive parts. Nissan will raise 9 billion yen, or about $83 million at current exchange rates, from the deal. The troubled Japanese car manufacturer has been selling assets including land, manufacturing operations and stakes in affiliate companies to raise cash and return to profitability. Miki Tanikawa
2000-08-02	Car Sales Rise, Except at G.M. And Chrysler	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said today that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories. Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force in the American economy during July.
2000-07-18	WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AMERICAS; RENAULT TO RETURN TO MEXICO	French car maker Renault will begin production of its Scenic minivan at Nissan Motor Co plant in Cuernavaca, Mex, by year-end, after 14-year absence from Mexican market (S)
2000-07-10	Offer for Nissan Affiliate	Johnson Controls, the auto parts manufacturer, will begin a tender offer on Monday for the shares of the Ikeda Bussan Company, a Nissan Motor Company affiliate that is best known for making premium-quality car seats. The deal is another strike at the heart of the tightly knit cluster of businesses linked to Nissan, which has been dismantling a cumbersome and costly corporate empire in an effort to return to financial health. It may also herald a rush of mergers and acquisitions in Japan's highly fragmented auto parts industry.
2000-07-01	MORE WORRIES ABOUT BRITISH AUTOMAKING	In a new show of concern over the impact of the British pound's strength against the euro, Prime Minister Tony Blair was expected to meet executives of the Nissan Motor Company of Japan to discuss its future investment in Britain. Like other carmakers, Nissan is worried that the pound's strength makes British exports too expensive. Nissan produces 340,000 cars a year at a plant in northeastern England, 75 percent of them for export. Nissan executives said the pound's strength could jeopardize plans to build a new Micra subcompact to enter production in 2002. Alan Cowell
2000-06-20	NISSAN DEAL WITH I.B.M.	The Nissan Motor Corporation, Japan's third-largest car manufacturer, handed over responsibility for the maintenance, operations and future development of its information systems to IBM Japan, a subsidiary of the International Business Machines Corporation. The two sides did not disclose the deal's value, but Nissan spent $750 million on information technology and systems last year, indicating that it is one of IBM Japan's biggest outsourcing deals. I.B.M. already has a 10-year, $1 billion contract to provide similar services for Nissan's North American operations. Stephanie Strom
2000-06-02	Auto Sales Declined 2% Last Month	Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun. Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American economy might be slowing.
2000-05-20	Nissan Loses $6.3 Billion in Fiscal Year	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's third-largest carmaker, reported today one of the biggest losses ever recorded by a nonfinancial company. The company's losses widened to 684.4 billion yen on a consolidated basis, or $6.3 billion at current exchange rates, in the fiscal year ended March 31, as Nissan erased outstanding pension liabilities, adopted new accounting practices and moved to close plants and cut employees.
2000-05-16	RENAULT, NISSAN TO CUT JOBS	France's second-biggest carmaker, Renault S.A., and the Nissan Motor Company, said they expected to save 1 billion euros ($915 million) by 2005 as they combine sales forces in Europe, where they will cut 504 jobs. The companies aim to increase market share in Europe to 17 percent from 14.2 percent now. They plan to redesign and rebrand some models for Europe, allowing Renault to sell sport-utility vehicles and Nissan to expand light truck sales.
2000-05-03	Auto Sales Keep to Torrid Pace Even as Loan Costs Rise	Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American economy by now, especially the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet the stampede into the showrooms continues across the country, with every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing today that sales last month exceeded even last year's brisk pace. The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge, indigo blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. Interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he wrote a check for the entire cost of the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the proceeds from stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by the high price of gasoline.
2000-04-16	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Nissan Sentra; Will More, More, More Be Enough?	NISSAN, having struggled in recent years to carve out its place in the sun, has landed on a formula that has long worked with consumer products from toothpaste to dishwashing soap: new, improved and more. With every model it has introduced in the past two years, from the compact Altima to the mid-size Maxima to the Pathfinder sport utility, Nissan has offered a much-improved car or truck over the previous one. In general, those vehicles have delivered more space, more power, more substance and more features than the earlier generation. While that recipe is typical of all automakers today, Nissan has thrown in another ingredient: to be tops in horsepower performance within the class.
2000-04-16	A Color Only a Fan Could Love	HENRY FORD said customers could have any color car they wanted as long as it was black, but Mr. Ford never went to college, which explains why he never made anything of himself. Had he graduated from, say, Michigan State -- which recently won the N.C.A.A. basketball championship -- he might have offered the Model T in the Spartans' team colors, green and white.
2000-03-25	G.M. BUYS STAKE IN FUJI	The world's largest automaker, the General Motors Corporation, said it would buy the shares held by the Nissan Motor Company and its affiliates in Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars. The purchase of 25.4 million shares, or roughly 4 percent of Fuji's shares outstanding, is part of G.M.'s agreement to buy a 20 percent stake in Fuji. Stephanie Strom
2000-03-23	Gentlemen, Merge Your Manufacturers; Consolidation Hits on Virtually All Cylinders	The consolidation of the global auto industry has reached a full-throttle roar as automakers around the world respond to the changing economics of the business. The list of companies partly or entirely acquired by other manufacturers in the last two years was impressive even before the frenzy of the last two weeks: Chrysler, Volvo Cars, Nissan, Saab, Fuji Heavy Industries, Suzuki, Daihatsu, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Since the beginning of last week, General Motors has agreed to buy a fifth of Fiat; Ford Motor has agreed to buy Land Rover from BMW; and DaimlerChrysler has moved close to taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Daewoo and Samsung are both up for sale in Korea, with deals likely later this year.
2000-03-17	Nissan to Get Its First Non-Japanese Leader	Carlos Ghosn, the Renault executive dispatched to Japan a year ago to help restore the Nissan Motor Company's profitability, will become its president, officials of both companies said today. The promotion is the first time a foreigner has assumed such a prestigious role in a major Japanese corporation. Another senior Renault executive on assignment at Nissan, Thierry Moulonguet, will become Nissan's chief financial officer as part of a broader management shake-up, the companies said.
2000-03-02	Auto Sales in February Near Monthly Record	The United States auto industry is poised to have its second-best month for sales ever after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported higher vehicle sales for February today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining companies report sales on Thursday. That would put February sales in second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million vehicles.
2000-02-08	NISSAN GIVEN 'JUNK' RATING	The credit rating of the Nissan Motor Company was lowered below investment grade by the Standard & Poor's Corporation after the company, a Japanese automaker, said a weak performance in its home market would pull down its operating profit. S.& P. lowered Nissan's long-term credit rating to BB+/B, the highest level of junk grade, from BBB-.
2000-02-04	NISSAN LOWERS FORECAST	The shares of the Tokyo-based Nissan Motor Company fell after the company, an affiliate of Renault of France, said it was likely to miss its operating profit forecast for the year ending next month, citing weaker-than-expected auto sales in Japan. The automaker, which sold a 36.8 percent stake to Renault last May, said late on Wednesday that it did not have a new target.
2000-02-02	Newest and Trendiest Autos Bring Americans to Dealers	Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles available, automakers said today, as every manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced big gains in sales. The three increases of a quarter percentage point each in short-term interest rates last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on the torrid pace in the auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that the industry this year would nearly match the record-setting pace of 1999.
2000-01-22	As Thefts Fall, New Yorkers Find Car Where They Left It	It has not been the cars that have been vanishing lately in New York City. It has been the thieves. During the last decade, as crime declined throughout the city, none of the major felonies tracked by the Police Department -- not murder, not rape, not robbery and not assault -- fell as sharply as auto theft.
2000-01-14	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Carmakers to Put 'Smog-Eating' Radiator in Some Models	VERYONE knows that cars contribute to smog. But what if you had one that actually reduced pollution as you drove? For five years, that has been the tantalizing promise of a technology developed by the Engelhard Corporation. Now, after some initial disappointments, Engelhard's ''smog-eating radiator'' is finding its way into new cars. The technology will be used at first in all Volvo S80 sedans and V70 wagons for the 2000 model year. It will also appear on this year's ultra-low-emission Nissan Sentra CA (for Clean Air), sold only in California.
1999-12-12	Strike or Strikeout?	If car company publicists ever get together for team bowling, there will be fierce competition to pick Gerry Spahn. Otherwise, they would want Mr. Spahn, Nissan's spokesman on the East Coast, to keep his distance. When Popular Science recently honored recipients of its Best of What's New awards, from the December issue, at a luncheon at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, General Motors set up a display of innovations including what the magazine had called ''dentproof'' urethane truck fenders. To demonstrate, G.M. rigged up a pendulum consisting of a bowling ball, on a steel cable, that could be slammed into the futuristic fender of a prototype Chevy truck.
1999-12-02	G.M. and DaimlerChrysler Report Weak Monthly Sales	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler announced November sales figures today that were weaker than expected as American automakers continued to lose market share to Japanese rivals, who posted big gains. G.M. said its sales in the United States inched up just one-tenth of a percent last month compared with figures in the period a year earlier, several percentage points worse than expected, while DaimlerChrysler said its sales fell 1.3 percent last month, marginally worse than expected. But Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and particularly Nissan Motor all reported large increases, while sales for Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled.
1999-11-09	BETTING ON A TURNAROUND	Carlos Ghosn, the chief operating officer of the Nissan Motor Company, said the company's executive committee, including Mr. Ghosn himself, would resign if Nissan failed to post a profit in the year ending in March 2001. Under Nissan's business plan, which was announced Oct. 18, the auto maker said it would close four plants in Japan and eliminate 21,000 jobs as it tries to return to profit by 2001.
1999-11-03	Foreign Nameplate Autos Are Sales Favorites in U.S.	Buyers snapped up cars and trucks with foreign nameplates last month, forsaking some of their past favorites -- American-made sport utility vehicles. Nearly every foreign brand reporting sales results today showed increases, and many notched double-digit gains. Toyota sales rose 12.6 percent in October compared to the same period a year ago. Honda sales rose 3.2 percent and Nissan jumped 27.6 percent.
1999-10-24	The World: Look Again; And You Thought Japan Was Stuck in a Rut	THE Nissan Motor Company could well serve as a metaphor for postwar Japan. Thirteen years ago, David Halberstam held up Nissan in ''The Reckoning'' as a shining example of Japanese economic prowess in marked contrast to American ineptitude. But in the last decade Nissan has mirrored all that is wrong with this country . Staggering under Himalayan sized debts, an arthritic bureaucracy and bloated inventories of boring cars, it reflects a Japan burdened by massive public liabilities, an aging population, an ossified corporate sector, one-party rule and a weak financial system.
1999-10-20	Nissan's Planned Cuts Arouse Ire and Offers of Help in Japan	Less than 24 hours after the Nissan Motor Company announced a far-reaching overhaul that includes plant closings and job cuts, Nissan, Japan's No. 3 auto maker, discovered today that candor does not play well here politically. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and various Cabinet ministers and party politicians chided the company and offered assurances that the Government would try to mitigate the impact of the plan on suppliers and residents in the communities surrounding the plants to be closed.
1999-10-19	Cuts by Nissan Are Deeper Than Foreseen	Hobbled by years of losses and high debts, the Nissan Motor Company surprised Japan and the auto industry today with details of a radical overhaul plan that will make unexpectedly deep cuts at the company, Japan's No. 3 auto maker, and reverberate more broadly through the economy. Under the three-year plan, presented by Nissan's aggressive new chief operating officer, Carlos Ghosn, three plants will be closed and 21,000 jobs eliminated, most of them in Japan. Nissan will also halve its supplier base and close 10 percent of its dealerships, with the objective of returning to profitability in the next fiscal year, starting April 1.
1999-10-14	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Can Nissan Turn on a Centime?; Trying to Revamp a Company and a Corporate Culture	Carlos Ghosn, the foreign executive charged with jump-starting the Nissan Motor Company, has a favorite joke: A fabulously wealthy man -- ''rich, successful beyond measure, big ranch with a big lake and mountains, you know, a little obnoxious'' -- shows a group of visitors a vast swimming pool stocked with crocodiles and alligators. He tells them he will give the one who jumps in anything he asks for. Everyone laughs, but as they walk away, they hear a splash and turn to see a man furiously flailing his way across the pool, hungry reptiles in hot pursuit.
1999-10-02	Auto Makers Finish Record Year on Strong Note	Customers drawn by hefty rebates bought more than 16 million new cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in the 1999 model year, breaking the sales record set in 1986. ''These are good times,'' said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president for sales, service and marketing for the General Motors Corporation, which had its best model-year results in a decade. ''The combination of affordable vehicles, high employment and buying momentum continues to propel us to record levels.''
1999-09-02	Auto Sales Rose Sharply In August	In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced today that their sales soared in August, with the biggest growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the highest profits. DaimlerChrysler A.G. said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States with a 2.8 percent increase.
1999-08-31	NISSAN TRANSACTIONS	Japan's second-largest auto maker, the Nissan Motor Company, will sell stakes in two affiliated auto parts makers. Nissan will use the money to repay debt, analysts said. The affiliates will buy the stakes in each other, bringing them closer together to compete more effectively against larger rivals. The sales will distance them from Nissan, which is cutting costs and selling assets to reduce its debt. Nissan will sell 11 percent, or about half its stake, of the Tachi-S Company, a seat maker, to the Fuji Kiko Company, a maker of safety belts and steering parts. It will sell most of its 23.8 percent stake in Fuji Kiko to Tachi-S.
1999-08-18	Hoping for Repeat Success, Auto Makers Build a Hybrid	Pickup trucks are popular and auto makers cannot build sport utility vehicles fast enough, so three auto makers have separately come to the same conclusion: it is time to start building sport utility pickups. At an annual convention here to show dealers the offerings for the new model year, the Ford Motor Company introduced the Explorer Sport Trac, to go on sale in January. Like similar vehicles planned for next year by the General Motors Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company, the Sport Trac has the passenger compartment of a four-door sport utility vehicle but also has a short, open truck bed in back.
1999-08-05	NISSAN-SAMSUNG RUMORS DENIED	Rumors swirled that the Nissan Motor Company was considering a bid for South Korea's insolvent Samsung Motor Corporation after some news services said a Nissan team had been sent to look over Samsung's manufacturing plant in Pusan province. Nissan called the reports untrue and said it was not interested in Samsung Motors. The South Korean company sought bankruptcy protection June 30, abruptly ending negotiations with Daewoo Motors, and its future is increasingly unclear. Nissan itself is struggling with large debts and recently formed an alliance with Renault S.A. Stephanie Strom (NYT)
1999-08-04	NISSAN BUYS MAZDA STAKE	The Nissan Motor Company, an affiliate of Renault S.A. of France, said it would buy the Mazda Motor Corporation's stake in the Japanese companies' automatic transmission joint venture. The move could help Nissan cut costs by developing transmissions with Renault. Mazda, an affiliate of the Ford Motor Company, will sell its 34.7 percent stake in Jatco, based in Shizuoka, near Tokyo, to Nissan, according to a Nissan spokeswoman, Ritsuko Harimoto. The price was not disclosed.
1999-08-03	NISSAN EXITS TELECOM BUSINESS	In another step aimed at focusing on its troubled automotive operations, the Nissan Motor Company will transfer stakes in nine mobile telecommunications companies to the DDI Corporation and the Japan Telecom Company. Nissan, which forged an alliance with Renault of France earlier this year, said it decided to quit the telecommunications business because the future costs of research and development were too large. Stephanie Strom (NYT)
1999-07-29	NISSAN-RENAULT TIES	The Japanese auto maker Nissan Motor said it might team up with its French counterpart Renault S.A. to buy steel and other components to cut costs. The shares of both Renault and Nissan soared yesterday. Nissan and Renault -- which bought 37 percent of the Japanese company in May -- will save about 55 billion yen ($472.5 million) next year through joint purchases of sheet steel, the newspaper Nihon Keizai said.
1999-07-11	Summer Flings With Staying Power: The Surfer Dude of Sport Utilities	SPEND some time with auto company brand managers and you hear the same phrases over and over. ''Active families,'' for instance, or ''extreme sports'' -- shorthand for the activities that are thought to obsess 20-somethings: mountain biking, kayaking, snowboarding, parasailing. Older joints ache at the possibilities. The 2000 Nissan Xterra is unapologetically aimed at this hyperactive generation. Its designers chilled out at trailheads and surfer beaches to observe how vehicles were used. They found, first, that young people carry a lot of stuff, and second, that they can't afford most sport utilities. Instead, the young and the restless fit bungee cords and racks to wagons, pickups and vans to handle their bikes, boards, skis and canoes.
1999-06-26	In a Change, Nissan Opens Annual Meeting to the Press	The Nissan Motor Company permitted outside news coverage of its annual shareholder meeting today for the first time, a sign that even the most traditional Japanese businesses are moving toward the greater disclosure and openness expected by foreign investors. In contrast to the brief choreographed agendas that have been customary at Japanese companies' annual meetings, the Nissan event ran 2 hours and 25 minutes, one of the longest. It also featured some other characteristics of Western annual meetings -- a slick video presentation and an outraged shareholder, who in this case demanded the resignation of the troubled company's president, Yoshikazu Hanawa.
1999-06-12	Incoming Executive Hints at Where Nissan Is Heading	Carlos Ghosn, the former Renault S.A. executive who will soon be helping manage the Nissan Motor Company, today gave reporters a peek at where he hopes to help steer the troubled Japanese car maker. Mr. Ghosn is an important part of the complex, cross-border alliance that began in March, when Renault bought a 36.8 percent piece of Nissan in hopes of improving its long-term chances of survival. As such, Mr. Ghosn has spent much of the time since the deal was announced trying to get to know the company he will officially join later this month. He is also taking a crash course in Japanese.
1999-06-06	Creating a Comeback at Nissan	''SOMETHING special is happening,'' intones the trim, energetic middle-aged man in a gray V-neck sweater. ''You can feel it.'' Indeed, something special is happening to Gerald P. Hirshberg, 59, chief designer for the Nissan design studio and television spokesman for the company's sales push. He has become the symbol of Nissan's struggle to remake its image -- a campaign buttressed by a fresh lineup of vehicles and $5.4 billion from Renault, which got a 37 percent stake in return.
1999-05-23	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2000 Nissan Maxima; Revved Up at a Pared-Down Price	IN the modern pantheon of hot cars, the Nissan Maxima ranks as a minor deity -- not up there with, say, the BMW 3-Series, yet forever to be honored as the first midsize sport sedan at about the same price as a drab family hauler. Introduced in 1981, the Maxima had crisp handling and a peppy engine, and it quickly won converts among Americans accustomed to Detroit bargemobiles and cookie-cutter Japanese compacts. A new, sleeker design in 1985 brought front-wheel drive and annual sales in the six-figure range. Another major makeover in 1995, which delivered more interior room and better performance for less money, cemented customers' loyalty, including mine: I've owned a Maxima for four years.
1999-05-23	Wedding or Wipe-Out?	A CANDID version of the advice that the Ford Motor Company might offer its competitor, Renault S.A., on making an investment in a Japanese car company would probably be something like this: Get ready for a long, hard trek, because the payoff won't come quickly. Ford's 20-year, $624 million odyssey with a Japanese car maker, the Mazda Motor Corporation, has so far produced a lot of headaches. But since Renault has already plunked down $5.4 billion to buy a 36.8 percent stake in the sputtering Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, avoiding the potential potholes is no longer an option.
1999-05-22	Nissan and Autonation Settle Dispute	Autonation Inc., the world's largest automotive retailer, and the Nissan Motor Corporation said on Thursday that they had reached an agreement that ended the auto maker's lawsuit over Autonation's right to buy more dealerships. The agreement comes after a Federal judge in February ruled in Autonation's favor in the two-year dispute. Nissan, based in Japan, is the sixth-largest auto maker in the United States. It had tried to enforce a 1997 oral agreement that Autonation would abide by rules that prohibit one owner from controlling more than 5 percent of total United States sales.
1999-05-12	DAIMLERCHRYSLER ENDS TRUCK ALLIANCE WITH NISSAN	DaimlerChrysler A.G., the world's fifth-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it had ended a truck development alliance with the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's No. 2 auto maker, following Renault S.A.'s acquisition of a 37 percent stake in Nissan. DaimlerChrysler and Nissan's Nissan Diesel Motor Company began working together in July to jointly develop three- to nine-ton trucks. The break was expected. The light-truck concept remains ''economically viable'' and DaimlerChrysler will produce it through its Brazilian subsidiary, Kurt Lauk, DaimlerChrysler's management board member in charge of commercial vehicles, said in an in-house employee magazine.
1999-05-04	Several Big Auto Makers Posted Robust April Sales	In a further sign of consumers' willingness to keep spending in a robust economy, auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April. The Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., Toyota, Honda and Nissan, along with a number of smaller auto makers, reported strong sales today, and the industry as a whole is on track to match or beat its vigorous sales pace of last April.
1999-04-17	Nissan Losses Take a Turn for the Worse	The Nissan Motor Corporation, Japan's second-largest car maker, reported a revised estimate of fiscal year losses today that were more than three times as bad as the company had anticipated. Nissan also eliminated the shareholder dividend for the first time since it became a publicly traded company a half-century ago. The car company, which recently sold a 36.8 percent stake to Renault S.A. of France for $5.4 billion, said estimated losses for the year ending March 31 swelled to 35 billion yen, or about $294 million, compared with a projected loss of 10 billion yen it had made earlier. The larger loss was not surprising to many automotive analysts, who had expected such a downward revision.
1999-04-11	Biting Hands Before They Feed Him	For a man in search of a foreign partner to contribute capital and skill to his struggling bank, Masao Nishimura, the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, is a surprisingly vocal critic of Western companies and their financial advisers. At a news conference on Wednesday, he accused Jurgen Schrempp, the head of DaimlerChrysler, of violating the terms of a contract with the Nissan Motor Company, one of I.B.J.'s biggest and most troubled clients, and otherwise excoriated the business tactics of foreigners.
1999-04-07	Pension Fund At Nissan Has $4.76 Billion Shortage	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, detailed the extent of its pension financing shortage today, disclosing a gap almost twice as large as analysts had expected. A spokesman, Masataka Saito, said the shortage in Nissan's consolidated pension fund was 580 billion yen, or $4.76 billion at current exchange rates, based on a relatively conservative assumed rate of return of 3.5 percent.
1999-04-03	NISSAN MAY END DAIMLERCHRYSLER TRUCK PACT	In the first sign of an overhaul after selling a 37 percent stake to Renault S.A. the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it might end its light-truck venture with DaimlerChrysler A.G. DaimlerChrysler had been in talks about taking a stake in Nissan but abandoned those plans last month. ''Renault aside, we're reviewing each of our product plans, and the same goes for trucks,'' a Nissan spokeswoman, Miki Obana, said. The company declined to comment on a report in a Japanese newspaper, Nihon Keizai, that it might also end its agreement to make minivans with the Ford Motor Company. Ford would say only that it has an agreement with Nissan to produce minivans through 2004.
1999-03-31	Renault May Send Vehicles to U.S. in a Nissan Wrapper	Having agreed last week to buy a little over a third of the Nissan Motor Company, Renault S.A. may start selling Renault cars under the Nissan name in the United States someday, but it has no plans to revive the Renault name in the American market, Renault's chairman and chief executive, Louis Schweitzer, said yesterday. While Renault may start selling vehicles using its own name in Mexico and possibly building these cars at a Nissan factory in that country, Renault has no intention of using its own name in the American market because its reputation is so weak, Mr. Schweitzer said.
1999-03-30	Renault Shares Rise On Earnings Forecast	The shares of Renault S.A. rose yesterday after the company, France's No. 2 car maker, forecast its 37 percent stake in the debt-laden Nissan Motor Company would strongly improve earnings starting in 2001. Renault's shares rose 1.05 euros, to 35.05, after touching 36.43 ($40) earlier, after the company said it would invest $5.4 billion in Nissan. More than 2.4 million shares changed hands. Nissan's shares gained 5 yen, to 468 in Tokyo.
1999-03-28	Cash for Nissan; Couture, Too?	NISSAN can certainly use Renault's help to straighten out its bleak and tangled finances. But it could also stand a nudge at the drawing board, some auto industry analysts say. Nissan products are ''obsolete, out of date,'' said Gregoire Van de Velde, an automotive consultant in Detroit. ''The styling is much too conservative worldwide.'' Mr. Van de Velde, president of Automotive Strategy, added, ''Renault has the capacity to bring Nissan what it is missing.'' He spoke as Renault, of France, was preparing to sign an agreement to buy 35 percent of Nissan, Japan's No. 2 auto maker, after Toyota.
1999-03-28	In Renault-Nissan Deal, Big Risks and Big Opportunities	In taking a stake in the troubled Nissan Motor Company, Renault, the stodgy French car company that has tried to become a formidable force in Europe, has embarked on a risky business gamble to strengthen the global competitiveness of both companies. The deal attempts to balance the differing needs of a Japanese auto company and a Western one. While some American and European companies have teamed up to better conquer world markets, some of the smaller Japanese and European auto companies have largely sat on the sidelines. The Japanese have been restrained by their culture and their reluctance to fully embrace change. Renault, on the other hand, has had a history of failed engagements and marriages.
1999-03-27	Nissan Looms Large for Renault's 'Cost Killer'	Here is the question confronting Carlos Ghosn: Can his team of 40 French executives rescue a loss-plagued Japanese car company with 40,000 employees? Mr. Ghosn, an executive vice president at Renault S.A. who is known as Le Cost Killer, is now leading the French car maker's plan to invest $5 billion in the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's No. 2 auto maker. Approval of the arrangement was formally announced today in Tokyo.
1999-03-24	Nissan Is Set To Combine Parts Units	The Nissan Motor Company said today that two parts-supplier subsidiaries would merge, furthering an effort by the troubled company to simplify its sprawling operations even while considering Renault S.A.'s offer to buy a 35 percent stake. The parts suppliers, the Calsonic Corporation and the Kansei Corporation, are facing sharp drops in their pretax profit for the fiscal year that ends this month because of deep cuts in Nissan's domestic production. As part of an extensive overhaul, Nissan is trying to wean its suppliers from their overwhelming dependence on its business.
1999-03-23	Renault Executive Seen in Nissan Post	Carlos Ghosn, an executive vice president of Renault S.A. who is known in France as ''le cost-killer,'' is the most likely candidate to become the chief operating officer of the Nissan Motor Company, French union officials said yesterday in Paris. Renault, the French car maker, has offered an estimated 32 billion francs, or $5.3 billion, for a 35 percent stake in Nissan. Mr. Ghosn, 45, heads the manufac
1999-03-18	Renault Offer To Nissan Is Questioned	Having failed in previous international mergers in the United States and elsewhere, Renault S.A. is encountering considerable skepticism in financial markets following the French auto maker's offer for a large stake in heavily indebted Nissan Motor Company of Japan. Credit rating agencies said today that they were reviewing Renault's finances, the company's stock fell sharply and investors questioned whether the proposal Renault announced on Tuesday would solve either company's problems.
1999-03-17	Renault Offers To Buy 35% Of Nissan	In one of the biggest gambles that a European car company has ever taken, Renault S.A. of France today offered to buy 35 percent of Nissan Motor Company, Japan's huge but deeply troubled producer of cars and trucks. If Nissan accepts the offer, which could be worth as much as $4 billion or even $5 billion, the deal would mark a rare incursion by a foreign company into the inner sanctum of Japanese industry. It would also transform Renault from a smallish European producer to one of the world's biggest players.
1999-03-16	Nissan Shares, And Hopes, Rise Sharply	Shares of the ailing Nissan Motor Company rose 13 percent in heavy trading today as investors increased their bets that Renault S.A. would seek to preserve its future in the rapidly consolidating global auto industry by taking a stake in Japan's second-largest car maker. Nissan said in a statement that it had received no formal offer from Renault and could not comment on any discussions. But Kaoru Yosano, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, said Nissan had become more confident that it would complete a deal. Mr. Yosano said he believed the two companies were close to reaching an agreement.
1999-03-15	Nissan in Talks With Renault About Stake	Negotiations concerning the sale of a stake in the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest car maker, continued this weekend in Europe. Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president, and four other Nissan executives flew to France on Saturday, people at the company said.
1999-03-13	Japan Signaling Its Intention To Keep Nissan Motor Going	The Japanese Government sent the clearest signal to date today that it would not allow the struggling Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, to collapse. ''It is the responsibility of Japan's industries, financial institutions and the Government to assist a leading industry,'' Kaoru Yosano, the International Trade and Industry Minister, told a news conference after a Cabinet meeting.
1999-03-12	Shares of Nissan Plunge and Its Credit Rating Follows Suit	Shares of Nissan plunged today and the auto maker's credit rating fell after the collapse on Wednesday of its merger talks with DaimlerChrysler A.G. The failure of the negotiations signaled serious problems not only for Nissan but also for many other auto makers. Shares in the Nissan Motor Company fell 11 percent in Tokyo today, while shares of its truck-building unit, Nissan Diesel, dropped 14 percent. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Nissan's credit rating today to junk-bond quality while Standard & Poor's, another rating agency, said it was prepared to lower Nissan's rating to junk-bond status, too, but would wait for the outcome of Nissan's efforts to raise money by selling a stake to Renault of France.
1999-03-11	DaimlerChrysler Abandons Talks About Buying Control of Nissan	DaimlerChrysler A.G. abruptly broke off negotiations today to acquire a controlling stake in Nissan Motor, Japan's huge but deeply troubled auto manufacturer. The decision, which came after face-to-face negotiations in Tokyo between the chairmen of the companies, is a big setback for Nissan's increasingly desperate search for a partner that could help it dig out from more than $20 billion in debt and six years of losses.
1999-03-11	Wondering What It Will Take to Get Nissan a Mate	Once again, the future of Japan's second-largest car maker, the Nissan Motor Company, is uncertain. The announcement today by DaimlerChrysler A.G. that it was walking away from negotiations about acquiring a controlling stake in Nissan and in its equally troubled truck-making affiliate, Nissan Diesel, ended one topic of speculation only to renew another: What will happen to Nissan?
1999-03-10	Nissan Plans To Pay Off Unit's Debts	Eager to resolve a sticking point in merger negotiations with DaimlerChrysler A.G., the Nissan Motor Company plans to announce on Wednesday that it is paying off debts at a troubled subsidiary, people close to Nissan said today. Nissan wants to reach a deal soon because credit rating agencies have been threatening to lower its rating. Nissan already has the lowest possible investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor's. A further lowering, to junk bond status, would hurt Nissan's ability to raise money it needs for development of new car models and other operations.
1999-02-26	In First Combined Results, DaimlerChrysler Profit Rises	Reporting its financial results as a combined company for the first time, DaimlerChrysler A.G. said yesterday that its 1998 earnings rose 28 percent on the strength of improved sales of vehicles and Airbus planes. But the figures from DaimlerChrysler, the world's fourth-largest car maker and Europe's biggest industrial company, were at the low end of financial analysts' expectations, and contributed to a 5 percent drop in the company's share price. DaimlerChrysler closed at $95.8125 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, down $5.125.
1999-02-16	Daimler Still Weighing a Deal With Nissan	DaimlerChrysler A.G. must decide before the spring whether to take a stake in Nissan, the president of DaimlerChrysler, Jurgen Schrempp, said today. Mr. Schrempp said a purchase of a stake in the Nissan Motor Company, the second-biggest Japanese car manufacturer, looked attractive now.
1999-01-23	DaimlerChrysler Sheds Little Light on Nissan	A much-anticipated news conference here today by DaimlerChrysler A.G. failed to clarify the future of the debt-laden Nissan Motor Company or its more-troubled truck-making affiliate. In a news release, DaimlerChrysler said only that its two chairmen, Jurgen E. Schrempp and Robert J. Eaton, met with Yoshikazu Hanawa, the president of Nissan Motor, on Thursday and that they had ''constructive discussions'' regarding the truck affiliate, the Nissan Diesel Motor Company.
1999-01-21	THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Japanese Giant's Not-So-Subtle Courtship	FOR SALE: A piece of the world's sixth-largest car company. Excellent engineering and technical capabilities. Some $20 billion in debt, but a fixer-upper with promise. Interested parties may apply to Yoshikazu Hanawa, president of the Nissan Motor Company. Mr. Hanawa has embarked on a sales campaign never before seen in Japan and perhaps in the world. Nearly every day for more than a week, Nissan's leonine president has been hawking his company, welcoming one and all to make a bid.
1999-01-20	Nissan Open To Selling Off Stake of 33% To Outsider	The president of the Nissan Motor Company said today that he would be willing to consider the sale of more than a third of the Japanese auto maker's stock to a foreign company. Yoshikazu Hanawa, however, continued to deny that Nissan was holding talks with a suitor. Speaking at a news conference to introduce the remodeled Silvia sports coupe, Mr. Hanawa said Nissan was ''not in capital alliance talks'' with any foreign auto maker about its taking a stake in Nissan.
1999-01-13	9 Auto Makers Form Coalition	Nine auto makers announced today that they had formed a new trade association. The members of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers are the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation of the United States; BMW A.G., Volkswagen A.G. and DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany; A.B. Volvo of Sweden, and the Mazda Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan.
1999-01-07	Auto Industry Finds Surprises At the End of a Rainbow Year	Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from which the General Motors Corporation has not fully recovered. With the last auto makers reporting their results today, the industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase from 1997.
1999-01-06	Auto Makers Up On Merger Rumors	Shares in the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company rose sharply today in the Tokyo stock market on rumors that the auto makers may be acquired by foreign competitors. Automotive executives called the rumors untrue. Honda rose 170 yen, about 5 percent, to 3,680 yen, to lead both the Nikkei and Topix indexes higher after Agence France-Presse reported that the Ford Motor Company was working to buy Japan's No. 3 auto maker and Germany's BMW A.G.
1998-12-08	A Japan Collaboration on Car Technology	Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest electronics maker, and the Nissan Motor Company announced today that they planned to collaborate on developing advanced technology for cars. It was the second time in a week that large corporations in this country have united to finance research projects, tacit acknowledgment that Japanese companies no longer have the financial muscle or unquestioned access to capital they once enjoyed. The cost of developing new technology is immense and is one reason for the consolidation taking place in the global auto industry.
1998-11-17	2 Japanese Auto Makers Are Under Debt Review	The United States ratings agency Moody's Investors Service warned yesterday that it might cut its ratings for two troubled Japanese car makers, the Nissan Motor Company and the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation. Moody's said it was reviewing for a possible downgrade its Baa3 ratings for both companies, which are already just one notch above junk bond status. The companies posted heavy losses for the six months that ended in September and warned that they would be in the red for the full year ending next March.
1998-11-16	The heady world of automotive campaigns includes a spinoff, a consolidation and a blitz.	BIG news is being made with big changes involving three big auto makers: the Nissan Motor Corporation USA, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America and DaimlerChrysler A. G., the behemoth formed by the merger of the Chrysler Corporation and Daimler-Benz A. G. The changes are indicative of the continual shifts that make automotive advertising one of the most fascinating, closely followed categories in consumer marketing. They include an agency spinoff, an account consolidation and a multinational, multimillion-dollar ad blitz that was the result of an unusual collaboration among several shops.
1998-11-12	Nissan, Losing Money, Seeks Public Loan	The Japanese Government is poised to come to the aid of the Nissan Motor Company, the nation's ailing No. 2 auto maker, by making loans from the Japan Development Bank available to it. The auto maker said that it was negotiating with the Government-backed bank for a loan but that the amount and timing had not yet been determined.
1998-11-11	Nissan Motor Posts $266 Million Loss	The Nissan Motor Company said today that it lost 32.55 billion yen, or $266 million, in the first half because of slumping sales and huge stock losses, forcing Japan's second-largest auto maker to predict its sixth full-year loss in seven years. The maker of midsized Altima sedans and pickup trucks projected that the company and its subsidiaries would lose 30 billion yen in the year ended March 31, revising an earlier break-even forecast.
1998-10-21	Making Its Marque at the Top; Toyota's Lexus Offers a Lesson in Brand Development	Ellen Passe sat in the passenger seat of an RX 300, the new Lexus midsized sport utility vehicle, while her 2-year-old son, Alex, fiddled with the steering wheel. Outside the car, her husband, Michael, spoke with a salesman at a midtown Manhattan Lexus dealership. ''Where are my heated seats?'' Ms. Passe asked good naturedly. The salesman quickly pointed to a small button near the CD player. Ms. Passe smiled.
1998-10-17	Nissan Expects Loss To Total $284 Million	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it expected to post a net loss of 33 billion yen ($284 million) for the first half of the current business year because of huge losses on its securities holdings. Nissan had previously said it expected to break even in the six months that ended on Sept. 30, but it announced two weeks ago that it had incurred appraised losses of 76 billion yen on its securities holdings because of the sharp drop in Tokyo stock prices.
1998-10-02	Nissan Says Nikkei's Tumble Has Decimated Its Portfolio	The destructive impact of Tokyo's tumbling stock market on corporate Japan turned apparent today when the Nissan Motor Corporation announced a severe decline in the value of its securities portfolio, which will likely erase profits for the six months that ended yesterday. The company, Japan's second-largest car maker, said it would record a 76 billion yen paper loss, about $553 million at current exchange rates, because the value of certain marketable securities it holds had fallen below the purchase price.
1998-09-30	Nissan Predicts Loss From Stock Holdings	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, said yesterday that its profit for the half year through today would probably fall short of expectations because of a stock valuation loss of 60 billion yen ($446 million). Nissan predicted in May that it would break even in the period, compared with net income of 38.5 billion yen in the corresponding period last year. Now it expects to fall into a loss as prices of shares it owns in banks and other companies have fallen below their purchase prices, said Shozo Hirata, a general manager in Nissan's finance department. That will outweigh a gain of more than 20 billion yen from asset sales, he said.
1998-09-25	Nissan to Sell Its Tokyo Headquarters	The Nissan Motor Corporation, Japan's No. 2 car manufacturer, is selling its headquarters building in the tony Ginza district here, making another small step toward paring its mammoth debts. The company is selling the building and the land under it to the Mori Building Sangyo Company and the Mori Building Development Company, two privately held real estate companies, for 14.6 billion yen, or $106.6 million. Nissan will continue to occupy the building, which is across the street from another building housing a large showroom, under lease from Mori.
1998-08-27	Nissan Sets More Halts In Truck Production	The Nissan Diesel Motor Company, the truck-making affiliate of the Nissan Motor Company, said yesterday that it might stop output for up to 12 days in the October-December quarter because of plunging sales in Japan. Nissan Diesel, Japan's fourth-largest truck maker, also aims to stop production for two days this month and four days in September, said Hiroshi Nakamura, a company spokesman. Nissan Motor is in talks to sell a stake in Nissan Diesel to Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany.
1998-08-09	Nissan Gives a Glimpse Of Its Plan for Recovery	ITS advertising slogan notwithstanding, Nissan has not been enjoying the ride. Now, it is counting on some new models to get it down a very bumpy road. In Japan, where the company has historically been No. 2 to Toyota, sales have fallen in a slumping economy while its debt has soared to $30 billion. Nissan posted a net loss of more than $100 million last year.
1998-06-29	Top man on TBWA Chiat/Day's Nissan account takes a leave. Other agency changes afoot.	THERE was a flurry of activity late last week involving personnel and organizational changes at several leading agencies and agency companies including TBWA Chiat/Day, J. Walter Thompson and True North Communications. At TBWA Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, the top executive on its largest account, the Nissan Motor Corporation, said unexpectedly that he would step down for a sabbatical of undetermined length.
1998-06-05	Nissan to Cut U.S. Production Sharply	The Nissan Motor Company, the loss-plagued Japanese auto maker that announced a broad reorganization last month, said today that it would reduce vehicle output at its United States factory by 25 percent, the sharpest cut since it opened in 1983. In the current fiscal half, which ends Sept. 30, the Japanese auto maker will halt production every Friday, or a total of 24 days, at the Smyrna, Tenn., factory, its only plant in the United States. For the fiscal year, which ends next March 31, the factory will turn out 300,000 vehicles, down from 400,000 the year before.
1998-05-14	Nissan Chief Talks of a Deal With Daimler at Some Point	The president of the Nissan Motor Company dangled the possibility on Wednesday that Daimler-Benz, the German industrial giant that is buying Chrysler, might some day make a similar deal with his company. At a news conference devoted to Nissan's vehicles for the handicapped, the executive, Yoshikazu Hanawa, was asked whether Daimler might buy a Nissan stake.
1998-05-13	Nissan to License Technology to Daimler	One day after announcing it was discussing ''business tie-ups'' with Daimler-Benz A.G., the Nissan Motor Company said it would license pickup truck manufacturing technology to the German industrial giant, which shocked the world last week with a deal to acquire the Chrysler Corporation. Daimler will use the technology, which helps produce Nissan Motor's Datsun pickup trucks, at Daimler's Brazil manufacturing plant, the Japanese company said.
1998-05-11	Nissan Is in Talks With Daimler-Benz	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest car maker, confirmed today that it was in discussions with Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany about a potential ''business tie-up'' between Daimler and Nissan's heavy-truck manufacturing unit, the Nissan Diesel Motor Company.
1998-05-08	Mergers Help Fuel a Two-Tier Global Auto Hierarchy	The global auto industry is increasingly divided into two tiers, as a half-dozen giant companies prosper while many of their smaller rivals struggle to manage heavy debts or afford the ever-rising cost of designing new cars. With the pending completion of today's acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G., each of the world's three major auto-producing regions will have two successful, global auto makers. Toyota and Honda are thriving in Japan. General Motors and Ford are enjoying record profits in the United States. Volkswagen and the new DaimlerChrysler, which will have German and American executives but will be dominated by European shareholders, will be the strongest auto makers based in Europe.
1998-05-07	Carmax and Nissan in Deal	Circuit City Stores Inc. said today that its Carmax Group, a retailer of used cars and light trucks, had agreed to become a franchisee of the Nissan Motor Corporation USA. Terms were not disclosed. Circuit City, based in Richmond, said the agreement would enable Carmax to acquire existing Nissan franchises, obtain new franchise points and integrate Nissan franchises into Carmax superstores or operate them as stand-alone sites.
1998-04-22	Nissan Shares At 23-Year Low	The shares of the Nissan Motor Company plunged 7.8 percent yesterday, reaching their lowest level since 1975, in the wake of the company's estimate on Friday that its profit fell 79 percent last year. Shares in Japan's second-largest auto maker, fell 35 yen, to 412, after falling 9 percent on Monday.
1998-04-18	Nissan Motor Expects Profit To Plummet 79% for Year	Hurt by slumping sales in Japan and the United States, the Nissan Motor Company estimated today that its group profit tumbled 79 percent in the fiscal year that ended March 31. The company said it expected profits of 16 billion yen, or about $121 million. Revenues are expected to fall 2.4 percent, to 6.5 trillion yen. Nissan cited the steep drop in demand for cars in Japan, as well as a more moderate decline in the United States.
1998-04-03	Nissan Shares Fall On Report of Stock Loss	The shares of the Nissan Motor Company plunged 6.9 percent yesterday, the second consecutive decline, after the auto maker said it would probably post a 50 billion yen ($376 million) stock loss for the year that ended on Tuesday. Shares in Japan's second-largest auto maker fell 34 yen, to 457. About 5.1 million shares were traded.
1998-04-02	Japan Deregulation Starts Amid Bad News	Japan entered a new era of financial-market deregulation on Wednesday as its fiscal year began, but the opening was overshadowed by chronic economic symptoms: a pioneering property broker declared bankruptcy, stocks plummeted and a global trading company disclosed its first loss in nearly a half-century. Other news of economic weakness also marked the beginning of Japan's financial changes. The Nissan Motor Company, the nation's No. 2 auto maker, said it would suffer an annual loss on its stockholdings in other companies. And forecasters said the quarterly business-sentiment survey of the Japanese central bank would confirm that most companies believe that the nation's economic problems are worsening.
1998-03-26	Spots for Adults Appeal to Children	Of the 10 commercials most frequently named by children as their favorites in a survey, two were for products not aimed at them: beer and motor vehicles. The findings were part of a national survey, called Ad-Traction, completed this month by Kidcom, the children's marketing unit of Campbell Mithun Esty, a Minneapolis agency that is majority owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. Preliminary findings of the survey, conducted among 800 children ages 6 to 17, are to be presented at a conference this week in Los Angeles.
1998-03-13	Nissan Says Profits Will Be Disappointing	The Nissan Motor Company, which was slow to start selling sport utility vehicles, said yesterday that it probably would not reach its profit target of 100 billion yen ($775 million) for the year ending March 31. While Toyota and Honda prepare to report double-digit profit growth for the year, Nissan, Japan's second-largest car company, will report profit fell more than 20 percent below its forecast because of slumping sales in the United States and Japan.
1998-03-04	Japanese Car Makers Set Cuts in Production	A number of Japanese auto makers said yesterday that they would cut domestic output in March because of weak sales in Japan, their biggest market. The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker after Toyota Motor, will cut output 10 percent compared with March 1997, while the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Japan's fourth biggest, said it was considering a 9 percent cut.
1998-02-23	Nissan Motor Expands Agency Relationship	The Nissan Motor Company has expanded its relationship with TBWA Chiat/Day by awarding it the account of Nissan Diesel America, a unit of Nissan Diesel Motor that distributes Nissan light- and medium-duty trucks in the United States under the brand name UD trucks. Billings were estimated at less than $5 million.
1998-02-04	January Car Sales Slowed By Incentives at End of '97	Sales results released by auto makers today showed January got off to a slow start, partly because of year-end incentives that led many customers to buy in December. The Chrysler Corporation and three of the largest Japanese auto makers reported double-digit declines in car sales last month. Chrysler actually fared better than many others that reported sales today. While its car sales plunged 14.7 percent, sales of its light trucks -- pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans -- rose 10.8 percent. Over all, Chrysler's sales rose 2 percent last month compared with a year earlier.
1998-02-03	Nissan Sales in Japan Expected to Show Drop	The Nissan Motor Company's sales in Japan may fall short of one million vehicles this year for the first time in 27 years, Tadao Takei, vice president in charge of domestic sales, said yesterday. Nissan projected in November that its domestic sales would be 1.06 million vehicles for the year ending on March 31, a 5.9 percent decline from the previous year. Mr. Takei said demand was sluggish because of a near-doubling of the sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in April.
1998-01-21	NISSAN SUES TO BLOCK REPUBLIC INDUSTRIES' ACQUISITIONS	The Nissan Motor Company said yesterday that it had sued Republic Industries in an attempt to stop Republic's acquisition of two Florida Nissan dealerships. Nissan approved several earlier acquisitions of Nissan and Infiniti dealerships by Republic. Nissan said the Florida lawsuit came after a year of negotiations with Republic had broken off. The Honda Motor Company has a Federal suit against Republic pending, while the Toyota Motor Corporation recently settled several suits against it. Republic, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has become the world's largest car and truck seller in the last 13 months as it has agreed to acquire 269 dealerships for its Autonation USA retail chain.
1997-12-05	Honda Is No. 2 in Japan	For the first time in its 49-year history, the Honda Motor Company can claim to be Japan's second-largest auto maker after the Toyota Motor Corporation. Last month, Honda overtook the Nissan Motor Company to sell more vehicles in Japan. Honda sold 74,706 autos in its domestic market in November, 4.3 percent more than Nissan's 71,593 units, according to figures released today.
1997-11-11	Nissan's Profits Jump as Exports Offset Slump in Japan	The Nissan Motor Company said today that pretax profit rose 47 percent in the fiscal first half as cost reductions and higher exports offset a slump in Japanese sales. Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto manufacturer, is fighting to increase domestic sales by focusing on the booming market for sport utility vehicles and station wagons, where it has trailed its rivals, including the Toyota Motor Corporation, the nation's biggest car company.
1997-11-04	October Auto Sales Weak Except for Newest Designs	People shopping for a new car last month were ready to plunk down money for the hottest new or redesigned models, leaving auto makers with lackluster sales for all but the freshest designs. The Chrysler Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October, the first month of the new model year. But its newest sport utility vehicle, the brawny Dodge Durango, sold briskly, as did its new four-door version of the Dodge Ram pickup truck.
1997-10-10	Nissan Sentra From Mexico	The Nissan Motor Company said today that it would invest $250 million in its Mexican division this month as part of a plan to shift production of the Sentra from its United States plant in Smyrna, Tenn., to Mexico. Nissan, Japan's second-largest car maker, said it intended to invest a total of $800 million in Mexico through the year 2000. The subcompact Sentra is being shifted to make room for a new sport utility vehicle.
1997-10-04	Auto Sales Weaken as Buyers Await Deals	Call it the car buyer's revenge. Auto sales slowed in September, and as a result auto makers are expected to announce a new round of rebates and discounted lease deals as they vigorously try to woo more buyers into showrooms.
1997-08-14	Nissan exults over an offbeat campaign, despite flat sales and a debate on ads that 'entertain.'	THE Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. is confidently declaring victory for a quirky year-old brand image campaign, despite lackluster sales and a debate still raging over the efficacy of advertising that seeks to peddle products by entertaining. ''We feel it's been a huge success by all of our goals,'' Tom Orbe, vice president for marketing at the Nissan division, said yesterday at a luncheon in midtown Manhattan. He cited the results of surveys that showed gains in important categories like advertising awareness, brand likeability and intent to purchase Nissan cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles.
1997-07-03	G.M. June Sales Off 13.3% Amid Industrywide Decline	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 13.3 percent last month, leaving the auto industry as a whole on track to end the second quarter with a whimper, following a stellar first quarter. The weak G.M. sales reflect lackluster demand for new cars and trucks industrywide, Wall Street analysts said. Sales of the company's pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles fell 7.7 percent, while car sales plummeted 16.7 percent in June, compared with a year earlier.
1997-07-02	Chrysler Sales Were Off 4% in June, Less, Though, Than Expected	The Chrysler Corporation reported a 4 percent sales drop for June today, its fifth straight monthly decline, but demand for its pickup trucks and mini-vans was so strong that the overall decline was less than Wall Street analysts had feared. Compared with June 1996, Chrysler's car sales dropped 14.8 percent last month, while sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and Jeeps rose 2.5 percent, setting a monthly record. So far, June looks to be a slow month for auto sales generally. Toyota reported a 2.3 percent drop in sales today compared with a year earlier, though Honda sales rose 8.9 percent and Nissan was up 2.4 percent. Most smaller manufacturers fared poorly. Total sales for the 12 producers reporting today were down 2.3 percent.
1997-06-16	An optical fiber composite to monitor the structural integrity of an airplane body.	AIRPLANE accidents often result from a chain of unpredictable events. Sometimes human error is to blame. Occasionally, people aboard planes make mistakes simply because they do not speak up. In 1988, passengers boarding an Aloha Airlines jet saw cracks in the fuselage near the plane's door. But they did not say anything -- perhaps because they assumed the cracks were not lethal, or that the aircraft's crew already knew about them. Unfortunately, the plane's metal skin was weak around the cracks and ruptured in flight. The top of the aircraft peeled back like the lid of a sardine can. A flight attendant was killed in the accident.
1997-06-04	G.M. Posts Decline in Sales; Mixed Results by Japanese	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.5 percent last month compared with May 1996, the second big American auto maker to post a sales decline for the month. Sales were mixed for large Japanese auto makers, which have been enjoying the benefits of a strong dollar. Toyota said today that its sales fell 6 percent compared with the period a year ago, while Honda reported that its sales rose 4.8 percent. Nissan said its sales rose 7.8 percent and Mazda said its sales fell 15.1 percent, and some other auto makers posted mixed May results today. For the 17 auto makers who have reported May results so far, sales are down 7.2 percent, with car sales down 11.7 percent and sales of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks up 0.2 percent.
1997-05-02	Sales for G.M. And Chrysler Fell in April	The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation said today that their car and truck sales cooled off last month, even as Japanese auto makers, benefiting from favorable exchange rates, reported stronger sales. G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, said that its sales in the United States dropped 5.2 percent last month from the corresponding period a year earlier, while Chrysler said its sales fell 11.5 percent. By contrast, the eight Japanese auto makers reporting April sales today saw their sales rise a combined 2.0 percent.
1997-04-13	Paying Homage to a Datsun With Soul	THE 28-year-old Datsun 240Z sports car is being reborn. About 200 worn-out 240Z's, manufactured for the 1970-73 model years, have been bought by the Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A. to be rebuilt from their bare body shells to better-than-new condition.
1997-04-03	G.M. Says March Sales Rose On Strength of New Models	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales increased for the first time in 10 months, rising 4.1 percent in March from a year ago. The gain represents the first sign that G.M.'s efforts to refresh a tired lineup of cars and trucks by adding 15 redesigned models may be luring buyers to showrooms. But analysts cautioned that sales during March 1996 were hobbled by a 17-day strike, making it far easier for G.M. to surpass last year's weak performance.
1997-03-12	Nissan Plans Outlays For Production in Spain	The Nissan Motor Company plans to invest about 100 billion pesetas ($692 million) in Spain during the next five years to introduce three new models, Nissan Motor Iberica S.A. said yesterday. The auto maker will build two small vans and a sport utility vehicle at its Barcelona plant, with production to start in 2000. One van will replace the Serena, which Nissan also builds in Barcelona.
1997-02-04	January Car Sales Up 2.3%; Foreign Makers Have Surge	Foreign auto makers showed the biggest sales gains in the American auto market last month as the strong dollar continued to help them offer generous lease deals and low prices. Among the nine auto makers reporting January results today, sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago. Foreign auto makers reporting results today saw their combined sales rise 10.9 percent, while the combined sales of the two American auto makers reporting results today dropped a tenth of 1 percent.
1997-02-01	Nissan Motor Cutting Jobs in U.S. Marketing Unit	Faced with stagnant sales and worried about what the consolidation of car dealerships will mean for auto makers, the Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. is eliminating several hundred jobs in its 2,500-member marketing staff through early retirements, incentives to leave and dismissals. Nissan executives said today that the cutbacks reflected purely a strategic decision to combine many management functions and reduce costs. ''We had accumulated a bureaucracy over 35 years that was really working against our intentions to be a small, nimble company,'' said Robert S. Thomas, the American unit's president.
1997-01-22	Nissan Plans to Add Production in Britain	The Nissan Motor Company said yesterday that it would build a new midsized car at its Sunderland plant in Britain, raising its investment by $:215 million ($357 million) and adding 800 jobs at the factory by 2000. Nissan has 4.6 percent of the British market.
1996-12-29	A Preference for Sport Over the Sport Utility	PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better. While critics of the auto industry argue that much more progress can be made on safety, durability and fuel efficiency -- and even that the internal-combustion engine should be retired -- there is little doubt that today's cars are far superior in all respects to their predecessors of just a decade ago. Fresh designs use space more effectively. Computer controls make engines start easier and run smoother. Electronic transmissions shift gears for optimum power and economy. Air bags, side-impact beams and ''crumple zones'' -- not to mention antilock brakes and traction controls -- have helped to reduce fatalities and serious injuries. More thought goes into the controls and more care goes into the way the pieces are assembled.
1996-12-18	Remember that Datsun 240Z you drove 25 years ago? Nissan hopes you will buy it again.	THERE are used cars, and then there are used cars. The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. has been buying up 1970 to 1972 models of its Z sports cars and restoring them to their former glory. The cars will be sold at 10 dealerships, starting in February.
1996-11-09	For Japan's Auto Makers, Windfall From Yen	A sharp fall in the value of the yen in the last year has been providing an earnings windfall to Japan's major automobile companies. Owing largely to currency fluctuations, the Toyota Motor Corporation reported today that net income for the first half of its fiscal year more than quadrupled as automobile exports surged. The Nissan Motor Company, meanwhile, recorded a first-half profit for the first time in five years.
1996-10-24	Nissan is changing the rules for car ads by rolling out entertaining spots using toy characters.	ROB SILTANEN, a creative director and copywriter at TBWA Chiat/Day, says he started out with the idea of remote control toy cars. Then he thought about live-action figures. And then one of those figures driving the car. An idea was born. ''I was just looking for something that could be dynamic,'' he said of his work for the Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. ''I couldn't believe it when Nissan bought it -- the idea of a toy car representing a real car.''
1996-10-20	Even the Spirit Is Scaled Down	SHORTLY after my early test drive of the redesigned 1997 Infiniti Q45, a new advertising campaign began for the model, the flagship of Nissan's luxury-car division. ''Everything changes but the soul,'' the tagline proclaimed. I would have written the slogan slightly differently -- something like, ''Everything has changed, especially the soul.''
1996-09-08	The Z-Car, From A to Zzzzz	ROADSTERS have caught the public's fancy, at least for the moment, and there is enough demand to justify new designs for high-priced grand-touring cars like the Jaguar XK8 and the Aston Martin DB7. But the conventional, affordable, enclosed sports car seems increasingly endangered. The latest casualty was the Nissan 300ZX, put to rest last month, ending a 26-year run for the widely acclaimed ''Z car.'' When the Datsun 240Z was introduced in October 1969, it was a sensation, offering sleek styling, taut handling and comfortable accommodations for two people at a sticker price of $3,526. Buyers waited months for delivery, including enthusiasts who would never have previously considered any car not made in Europe. Race drivers came aboard, and the Z went on to win 18 major professional championships and 29 Sports Car Club of America national titles. For Nissan, the 240Z and its successors helped to establish a performance image that spread to the company's economy cars, like the Sentra SE-R, and family sedans like the Maxima.
1996-09-05	G.M. Says Its Vehicle Sales Slipped 7.9% in August	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales last month dropped 7.9 percent from the strong levels of a year ago, partly because of weak demand for large sedans and luxury cars, and partly because dealers did not have an adequate supply of trucks to sell. Sales of G.M. cars plunged 13.8 percent in August, while sales of the company's mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose a slight 2.1 percent. Of G.M.'s eight divisions, only Chevrolet and Saab, the car maker it owns jointly with Investor A.B., reported higher sales.
1996-08-02	G.M. Sales Decline, but Chrysler's Surge	The General Motors Corporation's sales fell by 2.3 percent in July from a year earlier while the Chrysler Corporation's sales surged 18.8 percent, as overall demand for vehicles appeared to cool and shift toward mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks instead of cars. Nearly three-fifths of G.M.'s vehicle sales in the United States come from cars, while two-thirds of Chrysler's sales come from light trucks, which the industry defines as including mini-vans and sport vehicles. So the shift toward light trucks has particularly benefited Chrysler.
1996-05-29	Nissan Posts $814 Million Loss for Year	The Nissan Motor Company reported today that its group net loss narrowed in the latest fiscal year, and the company and analysts said they expected a return to profitability this year as conditions improved at troubled foreign operations. Results for the parent company alone, which reflect operations in Japan, recovered strongly in the latest fiscal year. But losses in Mexico and Europe pulled down group results, which reflect all the company's operations.
1996-05-09	Nissan Recalls A Million Cars	The Nissan Motor Company is recalling 1.12 million cars in Japan and the United States to fix faulty engine and seat belt parts that could result in fires. Nissan said the recall was the largest ever in Japan. Of the vehicles recalled, only about 70,000 were sold in the United States, all Infinitis. Nissan said the Infinitis had the faulty seat belt component.
1996-05-04	Detroit's Sales Pace Slowed in April, With Ford Off 2%	In the auto business, April was a lamb to March's lion. Car and truck sales last month dropped to an annual pace of 14.6 million, seasonally adjusted, down from a sizzling 15.9 million in March. The April slowdown reflected surprisingly weak sales at the Ford Motor Company along with shortages of some General Motors autos, which were slow getting to dealers because of a 17-day strike in March.
1996-04-10	New Nissan President Seeks Return to Profits	"The Nissan Motor Company named Yoshikazu Hanawa as its president, in a move analysts say will expand the marketing and planning prowess of Japan's second-largest auto maker. Mr. Hanawa, 62, will succeed Yoshifumi Tsuji, as Nissan focuses on becoming profitable again. In the year to March, Nissan is expected to post its first operating profit since the 1991 fiscal year. Mr. Tsuji, 68, who will become chairman, explained the move as a ""return to youth."" In the nearly four years Mr. Tsuji was president, analysts credited him with orchestrating the first phase of Nissan's streamlining, including the first plant closings for a Japanese auto maker since World War II. A shareholder vote on the appointments is scheduled for the annual meeting in June. (Bloomberg Business News)"
1996-04-09	Nissan Is Approved For China Venture	The Nissan Motor Company announced today that it had received the Chinese Government's approval for the manufacturing and marketing of commercial vehicles in a joint venture in China's Zhengzhou City. The joint venture, the Zhengzhou Nissan Automobile Company, in which the No. 2 Japanese auto maker has a 5 percent share, will manufacture 5,000 Nissan pickup trucks this year. The output is expected to rise to 50,000 by 2000.
1996-04-08	Advertising;'Car Talk,' an NPR program, wheels its act onto the Web, and advertising is being accepted.	"CAR Talk,"" already a weekly program on National Public Radio and a syndicated column in more than 200 newspapers, is now the subject of a site on the World Wide Web (http://cartalk.com) -- but with a difference. The site, unlike the radio program, will carry advertising. As with its broadcast and print counterparts, the site features the brothers Ray and Tom Magliozzi dispensing advice about automobiles with a sassy aplomb reminiscent of the attitude evinced by the sisters Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren."
1996-02-17	Auto Ruling Favors Independent Traders	The European Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that independent traders might sell cars across the European Union. Car dealers for Nissan, Ford Motor, Peugeot, Citroen, Honda and Renault -- all based in France -- had challenged parallel import sales by unauthorized resellers of new cars.
1996-02-12	Nissan takes its sport utility vehicle on safari, even if the customers are more likely to stick to the road.	TO be sure, the sport utility market has become a jungle. But who knew the Nissan Motor Corporation and TBWA Chiat/Day would take that so literally? An integrated marketing campaign imbued with jungle and animal imagery, which begins on Thursday, will introduce a version of the Pathfinder, the popular Nissan sport utility vehicle, that has been redesigned to be less trucklike and to offer more horsepower and headroom.
1995-12-21	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Risks of Cutting Too Far;Toyota Learns Customers' Limits With the Corolla	"The Toyota Corolla has been Japan's best-selling car for 26 years. So when Toyota introduced a fully remodeled and lower-priced version of the car in May, it expected a big lift in sales. But sales have been disappointing and Tsutomu Kusaka, a Toyota dealer in Yokohama, thinks he knows why. The new Corolla not only is cheaper than the old one, it also ""looks cheaper,"" he said. Instead of painting the bumpers, Toyota left them black. And ""the interior has become much poorer,"" he said. Toyota heard the complaints and five months after introducing the car, the Corolla was reborn with power windows and locks and nicer seats."
1995-12-21	Nissan Plant in Tennessee	The Nissan Motor Company said today that it would invest 5 billion yen ($49 million) to build a transmission plant in Decherd, Tenn., next to an engine plant that Nissan plans to build by early 1997. The transmission plant is expected to start operating in the spring of 1998 and is to make 300,000 transmissions annually. Nissan said the two plants were scheduled to create 200 jobs each. The transmissions will be used in Altima cars made at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tenn., as well as in Nissan and Ford mini-vans.
1995-12-10	Pathfinder Delayed	Nissan North America Inc. has postponed the introduction of the 1996 Nissan Pathfinder until mid-February because of two problems with the redesigned vehicle. The problems are a vibrating shield for the catalytic converter and imprecise spacing between the pistons and cylinder walls of the V6 engine, which was enlarged to 3.3 liters for 1996, from 3 liters. Nissan will add an additional shield to the converter, and will either add sleeves to the engine cylinders or replace the engines outright. The problems, which were not apparent on pre-production vehicles, surfaced in quality-control inspections of early production models.
1995-12-03	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1996 Nissan Pathfinder;Leaving Bigger Tracks Along a Crowded Trail	NISSAN'S introductory literature says that the buyers of its 1996 Pathfinder, like the buyers of other sport-utility vehicles, will be interested in skiing, tennis, travel and gourmet foods. It also expects them to be readers, and if that is true, the customers are going to be bemused by a dashboard that plays fast and loose with the English language. For instance, there isn't room for a lot of description on the speed-control button, so the elves in engineering simply hyphenated the control like this:
1995-11-03	First Operating Profit For Nissan in 4 Years	The Nissan Motor Company, benefiting from years of restructuring efforts, said yesterday that it had swung to an operating profit in its fiscal first half and that its pretax and net losses had narrowed sharply. The operating profit was the first in four years for Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto manufacturer. Although the operating result was not large enough to enable the company to post a profit on the pretax level, Nissan said that it expected a pretax profit for the full fiscal year. The results are for the parent company only. Earnings for the full Nissan group will be released later.
1995-09-20	International Briefs; Nissan Expecting Return to Profitability	The Nissan Motor Company forecast yesterday that it would achieve profitability in its current fiscal year as its new passenger models achieved steady sales. The company suffered a record loss of 61 billion yen in the year ended March 31.
1995-09-19	Nissan's British Plans	The Nissan Motor Company, the Japanese car maker, said yesterday that it would invest $:250 million, or $387 million, at its plant in Sunderland, in northeast England. The spending is to support Nissan's new midsize model, Primera, to be introduced in the summer of 1996. Nissan will build a plant for robot welding of rear axles and assembly of diesel engines. The engines will be made starting in 1997. Nissan employs about 5,500 people in Britain. (Bloomberg Business News)
1995-08-10	Mexican Peso Fall Leads To Auto-Sales Standstill	In the aftermath of the peso crisis, Mexico has turned into an incredible shrinking market for new-car sales, and world auto companies are scrambling to adjust. Mexicans are not buying cars. The peso's slide cut deeply into their buying power while interest rates on car loans hover around 46 percent. In the first half of this year, new vehicle sales dipped by 70 percent from the corresponding period in 1994.
1995-08-03	A Nissan Shift To Porter/Novelli	Nissan North America in Torrance, Calif., a unit of the Nissan Motor Company, has named Porter/ Novelli in Los Angeles to handle public relations for its Nissan and Infiniti lines, with billings estimated at more than $1 million. For the last 20 years the account was at Chiat/Day Communications in Venice, Calif., the public relations division of Chiat/ Day that was formerly known as Bob Thomas & Associates.
1995-06-25	"BEHIND THE WHEEL/Nissan Sentra;
A Small Car Aims for Comfort-Minded Drivers"	"PROBABLY the sweetest car I ever owned was a 1965 VW Beetle. Everything about it was distinctive: its color, sort of a honeydew green; its vinyl-wrapped steering wheel; its white plastic knobs so close to pearl.

But my favorite feature by far was its sunroof, like frosting on this little cupcake. Even though I had to struggle with a hand crank to open it, it made the VW seem so much more than basic transportation."
1995-06-22	NISSAN SAID TO PLAN INCREASED PURCHASES OF U.S. PARTS	The Nissan Motor Company will increase its purchases of auto parts, including engine parts, from North American companies, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported today, and will move production of some parts from Mexico to the United States. American and Japanese negotiators are scheduled to resume stalled talks on auto and auto-parts trade in Geneva later today, and the newspaper said Nissan would announce its revised procurement plan as soon as the United States dropped its demands that Japan meet numerical targets for increased parts purchases.
1995-05-27	2 Car Makers In Japan Post Huge Losses	Two of Japan's leading car manufacturers, Nissan and Mazda, reported huge losses today for their last fiscal years, heightening concern that Japan's overcrowded automobile industry is heading for a consolidation. The Nissan Motor Company reported a group net loss of 166.1 billion yen, or $1.86 billion, almost double the loss of 86.9 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year.
1995-05-23	Japan's Auto Makers Feel Bite of U.S. Tariff	The high tariff imposed by the Clinton Administration on Japanese luxury cars imported into the United States has begun to bite, forcing Japanese companies to suspend exports and cut production. The Mazda Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company said today that they had temporarily halted exports to the United States of the models that would be subject to the 100 percent tariff.
1995-05-17	Toyota and Nissan Vow To Hold Prices, for Now	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that at least for the next month, it would not pass on to its dealers or customers the cost of tariffs imposed by the United States Government. This means that in the short term, Toyota, which sells its luxury cars under the Lexus name, is willing to risk losing tens of thousands of dollars for each car it sells rather than sacrifice its share of the market.
1995-05-17	100% TARIFFS SET ON 13 TOP MODELS OF JAPANESE CARS	Living up to its threat to impose harsh sanctions on Japan, the Clinton Administration placed a 100 percent tariff today on 13 luxury car models that accounted for $5.9 billion in sales in the United States last year, including the flagship products of Toyota, Nissan and Honda. The tariff, the largest ever imposed by the United States against any trading partner, is to go into effect at 12:01 Saturday morning. Customs inspectors will be instructed to double the wholesale price of every Toyota Lexus, Nissan Infiniti and a number of other cars that roll off Japanese transport ships -- an increase that would make the cars all but unsalable.
1995-05-15	CHRONICLE	"GEORGE KLINEDINST's last trip through New York was not exactly headache free. He had just bought a collector's-edition 1970 Datsun Fairlady, one of only seven in this country. The destination was York, Pa., where he is a line technician for a cable television company. ""We got lost,"" Mr. Klinedinst said. ""What a mess. We were doing U-turns in the Bronx."" That was a few years ago. Now he has been invited back to New York for a party at the Whitney Museum today. Nissan North America is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its high-performance, pedal-to-the-metal Z cars (of which the Fairlady was a first-year cousin)."
1995-04-16	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Nissan 200SX SE-R; Flying Comfortably on the Cheap	UNTIL Nissan phased out the model last year, its little Sentra SE-R held undisputed claim to the title of poor man's Porsche: it was a bit Spartan inside and zilch to look at, but oh could it fly. Now the SE-R is back, this time as the serious driver's version of the 200SX, Nissan's new line of budget-priced sports coupes. And while it is no longer an ugly duckling, it can still fly. Nissan, like the other Japanese car companies, is caught between the rising yen and formidable competition from a newly invigorated Detroit. Unlike most of them, though, Nissan has responded with a slew of new models for the American market that are affordable, yet cut no important corners.
1995-03-22	AT&T Cutbacks in Japan Rattle Old Sensibilities	"In a drab industrial district of Tokyo, where the AT&T Corporation runs some Japanese operations, workers are handing out pamphlets attacking the American company's ""bullying"" of employees. A half-day walkout has already been carried out, and the union is threatening a full-fledged strike if AT&T does not stop conduct it regards as outrageous. The problem is that AT&T is being assailed for doing what American companies think they should be doing: cutting costs to improve the bottom line."
1995-03-06	Nissan Plans to Accelerate Cutbacks	The Nissan Motor Company said today that it would accelerate its efforts to reduce its work force and cut its costs in the face of continued huge financial losses. The statement reflects a sense of crisis at Japan's second-largest auto maker, which has lagged behind some rivals in benefiting from the upturn in Japan's automobile sales that began in the middle of last year.
1995-03-04	Ford's Sales Rose in February; Nissan's Fell	Contributing to the cacophony of signals about the condition of the auto market in the United States, the Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales of vehicles rose in February, while the Nissan Motor Company said its sales fell during the month. Most auto makers reported their sales on Wednesday. Altogether, sales of cars and light trucks fell 4.1 percent, compared with a strong period a year earlier. Light-truck sales edged up, while car sales fell more than 7 percent.
1995-01-08	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Infiniti J30t; That Face, That Name; Have We Met Before?	"I WAS remembering a guy at a Massachusetts mall a long time back. He was carrying a briefcase, looking lost and saying over and over: ""They stole my car. I can't believe they stole my car."" That picture flashed through my addled brain the other day, and what evoked the memory was that I, too, was muttering to myself in a shopping mall parking lot. That is what you do when you can't find your car."
1994-11-06	BEHIND THE WHEEL: Nissan 300ZX Turbo; No Age Restrictions Apply	"IT'S a big country, and Americans are big people. We like Big Macs, Big Gulps and Biggie Fries. We like our cars big, too -- even the small ones. This poses a challenge in building a ""world car,"" a vehicle that can be made and sold globally with only small concessions to local tastes. The Japanese are masters at this, but Detroit has never been able to make Americans fall in love with Opels adored by Germans, or set foreigners swooning over the Pinto or the Chevette."
1994-10-14	Hakuhodo Opens Office With TBWA	TBWA International in New York and Hakuhodo Inc. in Toyko said yesterday that they had further expanded their relationship by teaming up to open an agency in the Netherlands to handle their Canon Europe and Nissan Europe accounts with billings estimated at $200 million. Hakuhodo (Nederland) B.V. in Amstelveen, which handles the Canon Europe account, will merge with TBWA/NETH-work, a joint venture that TBWA and Hakuhodo founded in 1989 to handle Nissan Europe. The new shop, not yet named, will seek other clients besides Canon and Nissan; it will be based in the TBWA/NETH-work offices in Amstelveen.
1994-09-08	Ruling May Further Open U.S. Auto Market to Japan	In a decision that could help Japanese auto makers re-enter the two-door sport-utility vehicle market in the United States, a Federal appeals court ruled today that the two-door Nissan Pathfinder was wrongly classified as a cargo vehicle, subjecting it to a 25 percent import tariff. Instead, the court ruled, United States Customs should treat the two-door Pathfinder as consumers would -- as a passenger vehicle -- and subject it only to the 2.5 percent tariff for imported cars. Partly because of the steep cargo tariff, which was imposed in March 1989, Nissan stopped importing the two-door Pathfinder in 1990; also, the Toyota Motor Company stopped importing a two-door sport-utility vehicle.
1994-08-31	Infiniti Plans New Sedan	The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A.'s Infiniti luxury car division will add a fourth sedan to its model line in the spring. The Infiniti I30, which will make its debut as a 1996 model, will be positioned between the compact G20 sedan, which sells for about $23,000, and the midsize J30 sedan, which sells for $38,550. Nissan's flagship model, the Q45, is priced starting at $52,400 for 1995. The I30 will be made in Japan. The model is expected to compete with the new Mazda Millenia, as well as Toyota's Lexus ES300 and Honda's Acura Vigor and Legend.

1994-07-07	Japanese Made Gains In June Vehicle Sales	The leading Japanese auto makers posted strong sales and gains in market share in June, driving up total car and light-truck sales for the month despite a weaker performance by the Big Three. Over all, sales sustained the moderate growth they have managed since easing off in May, sticking to a pace that analysts say bodes well for continued slow growth in the economy. Sales of cars and light trucks rose 6.8 percent compared with a strong period a year earlier.

Of Running Shoes and Ruby Slippers"	"DRIVING the new Toyota Celica is like wearing a fine leather dress shoe. You can't run fast in it, and it costs more than other pumps might. But it's supple and sleek, fitting your foot as if it were custom-made. You feel, and look, great.

Driving the Acura Integra is like wearing a well-engineered athletic shoe. You can tear up a track. You feel, and look, macho."
1994-06-24	Chrysler and Nissan Top Auto Production Survey	The Chrysler Corporation is the most profitable and lowest-cost maker of automobiles in North America, while the Nissan Motor Company's plants are the most efficient, according to a survey released here today. The General Motors Corporation has improved its efficiency the most, gaining almost 12 percent from a previous study for 1992.
1994-03-26	Nissan Plans 80% Increase In Buying American Parts	Executives of the Nissan Motor Company said today that the company planned an 80 percent increase in its purchases of American-made automobile parts to $4.3 billion over the next five years. Nissan is thus the first Japanese auto maker to announce goals for the purchases of American components to appease the United States.
1994-03-06	Finding a Fancier Path to Spring	THE Tonya and Nancy show was fun for a while. But even without its ignominious fizzle, I have to say that I am good and sick of winter games, Olympic or otherwise. I am tired of my snow blower. Tired of blue hands and a red nose. Tired of stores that are out of salt for the walk. Tired of water that drips and water that doesn't, and of the hill that slips and slides down to my cul de sac.
1994-02-23	MORTON INTERNATIONAL GETS NISSAN AIR BAG CONTRACT	"Morton International Inc. said yesterday that it had received a contract from the Nissan Motor Company to supply air bag inflators for the Japanese domestic market, starting with the 1995 model year. Morton, based in Chicago, will make the inflators at its plant in Ogden, Utah. The company did not immediately disclose the value of the contract with Nissan, although a Morton spokeswoman, Janis Tratnick, said that Nissan sold about one million vehicles a year in Japan and that the contract ""is for a major portion of that business."" Shares of Morton rose 62.5 cents, to $103.75, on the New York Stock Exchange, after reaching $105 earlier in the day."
1994-01-14	NISSAN TO SELL FORDS IN JAPAN AND MOVE SENTRA TO U.S.	The Nissan Motor Company said early today in Tokyo that its largest dealer was planning to sell cars made by the Ford Motor Company in the Tokyo area. Tokyo Nissan, a dealer in which Nissan owns a 25 percent stake, is now talking with Ford, a Nissan spokesman said. In 1992, Nissan pledged to sell 3,000 Ford cars a year through its dealers in Japan. But nothing came of the pledge, partly because Ford wanted to concentrate its sales through Autorama, a Japanese dealer network it owns with the Mazda Motor Company.
1993-12-30	NISSAN TO RAISE U.S. PRICES EFFECTIVE JAN. 3	The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. will increase prices on certain 1994-model cars and trucks by an average of 2.0 percent, or $321, effective on Monday. Within the Nissan line, the price of the auto maker's most popular United States model, the Altima GXE sedan, will increase by 1.8 percent, or $295, to $15,979. The least expensive Nissan car, the Sentra two-door, is increasing 3.2 percent, to $10,199.
1993-10-27	Auto Plant Closings in Japan	The Mazda Motor Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company said today that they would shut all or part of their operations for two days next month to reduce inventories and save money. Workers, however, will still get 90 percent of their pay for days they are idled. In Japan, where the lifetime employment tradition means full-time workers are rarely dismissed, even a two-day shutdown attests to the problems of Japan's auto industry. Mazda and Nissan have had particularly heavy losses.
1993-08-31	3 Japan Auto Makers' Debt on Credit Watch	The Standard & Poor's Corporation placed more than $25 billion of debt of the top three Japanese auto makers on credit watch with negative implications today, in a move that could eventually raise the borrowing costs for the Japanese automobile industry. S.& P.'s move was further verification of the deteriorating financial position of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company, which have been hurt by the soaring value of the yen and sharper competition from Detroit's Big Three auto makers.
1993-07-14	Big 3 Rebuffed on Minivans	Detroit's Big Three auto makers lost another round today in their attempt to convince trade officials that the Japanese were selling minivans below cost in the United States. The United States Court of International Trade, which serves as an appeals tribunal in trade issues, rejected arguments by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation that Japanese manufacturers had inflicted financial harm on them by selling minivans at less than fair market value, which is called dumping.
1993-07-04	Nissan Lifts the Lid on Its 300ZX	THERE is a red convertible out there in the driveway, and I've just been walking around it, taking some pictures, remembering . . . . The car is a new Nissan 300ZX, a Z-car in the parlance and a descendant of the first Japanese automobile that truly fired the American blood. When it came to this country in 1970, it was called a Datsun 240Z, a taut and inexpensive two-seat hatchback that was a real sports car.
1993-06-20	Infiniti's G20: Luxury at the Entry Level	"IT must be tough to be an automotive-product planner. Sure, you have an easy day when the boss comes by and tells you to whip up a fantastic sports car. Or a utility vehicle. Or even a new station wagon. But what do you do if you work for a luxury line and you have to invent an ""entry-level"" car?"
1993-06-16	NISSAN IS RAISNG PRICES ON SOME 1993 MODELS	The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. increased prices on certain 1993 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles by an average of eight-tenths of a percent because of the strength of the yen against the dollar. The price increase for Nissan models averaged seven-tenths of a percent, or $112; prices on Infinitis were raised an average 1.1 percent, or $228.
1993-06-14	Trade Policy Test at Nissan's Tennessee Plant	"For Sylvia B. Rice, who snaps window moldings onto the drivers' doors of new Nissan Altimas here, there are clear advantages when foreign companies set up shop in the United States. ""This factory has provided a lot of jobs to a lot of people,"" said the 40-year-old single mother of two teen-agers, as car bodies on an overhead conveyor belt moved past her."

Mr. Pryce, who starred in ""Miss Saigon"" and ""Barbarians at the Gate,"" will present the new Infiniti Q45 luxury model in the Nissan campaign, which is scheduled to be introduced today. The campaign is the first for Infiniti by Chiat/Day of Venice, Calif., since Infiniti dismissed Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos of Marina del Ray, Calif., last November. Chiat/Day also handles the Nissan account."
1993-04-15	Sales Rise For Vehicles Built in U.S.	Sales of domestically built vehicles excluding those built by the Ford Motor Company rose 14.8 percent in early April from the corresponding period a year ago. In a deviation from its pattern of reporting on the same day as other auto makers, Ford said it would release its 10-day sales figures on Thursday. The Chrysler Corporation does not provide partial monthly figures; its sales are estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports. 'Demand Is Only So-So' Some analysts cautioned that demand could be slightly better or slightly worse once hard data from Ford and Chrysler were available.
1993-04-13	Nissan's U.S. Chief Resigns, Apparently Under Pressure	"The president and chief executive of the Nissan Motor Company's American operations resigned today, after months of rumors that Nissan executives in Japan were unhappy with his performance. The chief executive, Thomas D. Mignanelli, had been one of the first Americans to receive wide authority at a Japanese auto company. He cited ""personal reasons"" for leaving Nissan. In February, he underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery, but a spokesman said that had no connection with the announcement today."
1993-03-03	Layoffs and Factory Closings Shaking the Japanese Psyche	"For years the popular mythology in Japan has been that plant closings and corporate layoffs were quintessentially American. Humane Japanese companies would rather accept losses than cast an employee into the street. But throughout the country the dreaded phrase these days is ""kata tataki,"" or ""tap on the shoulder."" Not only are industrial workers getting the tap, but even employees of the richest and seemingly most secure companies."
1993-02-25	Japanese Cars Get British Accents	"The Japanese auto makers, having entrenched themselves in the United States, are turning to what is perhaps the world's most hotly contested and most promising market: Europe. Following the same basic strategy that helped push their share of the United States market to 30 percent from 20 percent during the last decade, Toyota, Nissan and Honda are starting to produce cars in large numbers in Europe. They are building efficient new plants in British towns like this one in the English Midlands, home to a $1 billion Toyota factory that opened in December. The goal, as it was in the United States, is to sidestep ""voluntary"" quotas that limit their exports from Japan."
1993-02-24	Nissan Plans Shutdown Of Auto Plant	In another major retrenchment, the Nissan Motor Company said today that in two years it planned to cease automobile assembly in what was once its flagship Japanese factory. Japanese car companies had invested heavily in new plants in the last few years, only to be faced now with overcapacity as demand continues to shrink. Nissan's announcement, however, represents one of the first times during the current slump that an auto company has decided to shut down a factory, although Isuzu Motors has said it will give up car manufacturing entirely. Nissan to Cut 5,000 Jobs Nissan also said it would cut 5,000 employees from its staff of 53,000 in three years through attrition and reduced hiring. In announcing the new plans today, the Tokyo-based company also said that the parent company now expects to report an operating loss of $330 million for the fiscal year that ends next month. That figure represents an increase of more than 75 percent from the loss that Nissan had forecast in November.
1993-02-21	World Class, in More Ways Than One	SUPPOSE you are an American designer and the job is to work up a new and semi-pricey Japanese car. Suppose further that you like the look of the old Jaguar sedans, and that you were always a bit taken with the lopped-off trailing edge of the Peugeot 504's trunk. Suppose, too, that you intended all along to steal Maserati's jewel-like clock and make it the centerpiece of your dashboard. When you get done with your sketches and models and blueprints, what do you have? Well, you might have the camel that was a horse designed by committee. To say the least, you probably would have a polyglot automobile that bespeaks America, Japan, England, France and Italy.
1993-01-31	From Nissan, a New Name, a New Car	LET'S get the bad stuff out of the way first: Nissan's new Altima is like a man who wears suspenders with a belt. Not content with an air bag in the hub of its steering wheel, the new mid-sized sedan also incorporates those Rube Goldberg mechanical seatbelts that, mercifully, are being phased out everywhere.
1993-01-15	Nissan and Mazda Planning to Sell Vehicles to Each Other	Two of Japan's leading automobile companies, Nissan and Mazda, said today that they were planning to supply vehicles to each other to cut costs. The move is part of a new wave of cooperative efforts among Japan's suddenly struggling vehicle manufacturers.
1992-09-30	COMPANY NEWS	FORD MOTOR CO., Dearborn, Mich., and Nissan Motor Company of Japan issued separate recalls to fix faulty brakes and seat belts on about 3,500 of their jointly built Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest mini-vans. GRUMMAN CORP., Bethpage, L.I., has been awarded a $7.9 million contract that could be worth $220 million from the Army to make intercom systems for combat vehicles. UNISYS CORP., Blue Bell, Pa., and California Republic Bank, Bakersfield, Calif., announced an agreement for a 10-year information systems outsourcing contract valued at $56 million.
1992-09-29	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Marketing the New Nissan: A Peek First, the Facts Later	"NISSAN is teasing again. Three years ago, the Japanese auto maker set the advertising industry buzzing with Zen-like rocks-and-trees ads for its fledgling Infiniti luxury division. The agency that created the campaign, Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, justified the strategy of hiding the cars from view by explaining at the time: ""We're not selling the skin of the car, we're selling the spirit."""
1992-09-02	Nissan's Rating Might Be Lowered	In a move that could lead to increased borrowing costs for the Nissan Motor Company, the Standard & Poor's Corporation has placed the company's debt rating on credit watch for possible downgrading. Standard & Poor's said the action affects about $8.7 billion of the debt of Nissan, the second-largest auto company in the Japanese market. The move was prompted by a decline in automobile demand in the slumping Japanese economy, continued weakness in overseas markets and heightened competition.
1992-09-01	Infiniti Prices Rise 3%	The Infiniti luxury car division of the Nissan Motor Corporation said yesterday that it was increasing prices on the 1993 models of its Q45 and J30 sedans by about 3 percent. The base price for the Q45 sedan is $45,400, up from $44,100 on the 1992 model. The price of the recently introduced J30 sedan will be $34,000, up from $33,000.
1992-08-25	Nissan Is Replacing Advertising Theme	"The Nissan division of the Nissan Motor Company's United States sales arm said yesterday that it would adopt the slogan ""It's time to expect more from a car,"" replacing ""Built for the human race,"" its advertising theme for the last five years. The change comes as Nissan, seeking to stimulate sluggish American car and truck sales, is bringing out new models like the Altima, a midsized sedan, and Quest, a mini-van."
1992-07-30	NISSAN IS SAID TO PLAN REDUCTION IN AUTO PARTS	The Nissan Motor Corporation, the second-largest auto maker in Japan, will gather its 120 auto parts suppliers on Aug. 6 to tell them the company's plan to reduce the number of parts for all makes of its cars by around 30 percent in a standardization program, the newspaper Nihon Keizai said. By reducing the number of parts, the company hopes to reduce production costs, the paper said. Parts makers can also benefit from economy of scale, it said.
1992-07-28	Nissan Sales Strategy: Think 'Car,' Buy Mini-Van	Like most station wagons, the mini-van is more about utility than about fantasy. Forget romance, power and style; these autos exist for grocery shopping, soccer games and weekend gardening projects. But the Nissan Motor Company, in trying for the third time to sell mini-vans in the United States, is striving to balance the two worlds to tap the apparent discontent of one category of customers. Its research detected a latent but smoldering resentment among baby boomers against driving a sluggish, boxy conveyance to fulfill family responsibilities.
1992-07-20	Japan Lures Auto Workers With 'Dream' Factories	"Move over, Disneyland. Make way for Nissan Human Land, as a company brochure describes the Nissan Motor Company's newest factory. Here workers toil not in the assembly plant or paint shop, but work happily in the assembly or painting ""pavilions."" They walk along Palm Street and over Flamingo Bridge. And they eat in an employee cafeteria called the Harbor View Restaurant, with a panoramic view of the loading docks."
1992-06-24	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Ultimately, Nissan Calls Car 'Altima'	"WITHIN months, the Nissan Motor Company will roll out a replacement for its slow-selling Stanza compact with the ambitious goal of winning over car shoppers inclined toward the Honda Motor Company's popular Accord and the Toyota Motor Corporation's Camry. Nissan faced an equally daunting challenge in 1987 when its executives sat down to name the car. The Stanza moniker was often criticized for being too much like Nissan's subcompact Sentra, which shares four of six letters with Stanza. ""For some reason, the Stanza never stuck in anyone's mind,"" said Earl Hesterberg, vice president and general manager of the Nissan division of the parent's American arm. Many industry watchers considered Stanza the second misnomer from Nissan, which confused consumers in the early 1980's by switching its nameplate from Datsun to Nissan."
1992-05-25	Egypt Deal for Nissan	The Nissan Motor Company will soon begin assembling cars in Egypt in a joint venture with an Egyptian company, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported today. The newspaper said Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker after Toyota, had not yet settled all of the details.
1992-05-11	Breaking the Mold at Nissan Design	"In the clubby world of the auto industry, where many executives are said to have gasoline in their veins, Gerald P. Hirshberg seems driven by an alternative fuel. As the top American at Nissan's design studio in California, Mr. Hirshberg is responsible for the shapes of three models this year, including two sedans that buck the current popular ""wedge"" theme of low-slung hoods and high trunk lids."
1992-04-02	New Nissan Car Is Named Altima	The Nissan Motor Corporation said it would name its midsize sedan Altima when it is introduced this fall. The model will replace the Nissan Stanza, which was first introduced in 1981.
1992-03-28	Successor Is Named To Nissan President	The Nissan Motor Company said yesterday that Yoshifumi Tsuji, an executive vice president and former production engineer of the auto maker, would succeed Yutaka Kume as president. Mr. Kume will take over Nissan's largely ceremonial position of chairman, replacing the retiring Takashi Ishihara. Nissan executives in the United States described Mr. Tsuji, 64 years old, as a decisive and straightforward manager who pays attention to subordinates' suggestions and views. They added that Mr. Tsuji was well suited to Nissan after years of rapid expansion that included building an assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn., and a research and development center in suburban Detroit.

1992-03-02	Price Increase Set by Nissan	The Nissan Motor Corporation in the United States says it will raise prices on its cars and light trucks an average 3 percent, or $432. Nissan's Infiniti luxury-car division will raise its prices 4.2 percent, or $1,355. All price increases are effective March 1.
1992-02-06	Japan's U.S. Plants Pose a Dilemma	Two Japanese auto makers are seeking Commerce Department permission to extend favorable duties they now receive on imported parts for their American-made cars. The companies want to expand their factories in the United States without paying higher tariffs on the additional parts they will need to import. Since opening their United States factories in the 1980's, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company, like Detroit's Big Three car makers, have held a special Government exemption that lets them pay duties of no more than 2.5 percent on parts they import for assembly. The standard duties for auto parts range from 3.1 percent to 11 percent.
1992-01-28	U.S.-Japan Auto Parts Rift Grows	"In tones reflecting the increasingly combative exchanges between Japan and the United States, the head of a Japanese auto group said today that it was ""incomprehensible"" that Detroit had not accepted Tokyo's offer to buy $19 billion more in American-made auto parts. He said top Japanese executives ""have no intention"" of discussing the issue again with the Big Three. The comments by Yutaka Kume, the president of Nissan Motor Company and the chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, virtually erased any hopes of continuing discussions among the world's biggest auto makers about how to close the trade gap between the countries."
1992-01-10	A Trade Mission Ends in Tension As the 'Big Eight' of Autos Meet	"President Bush's hopes of returning home with what he called an ""action plan"" to help Detroit began to unwind late this afternoon, in one of the most unlikely business meetings in the history of Japanese-American industrial rivalries. The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers -- three American, five Japanese -- gathered face to face in a hotel room in downtown Tokyo, with everyone in the room clearly understanding, and no one saying, that the American industry will probably never gain back the ground it has lost to Japanese imports and to Japanese cars made in American plants. A Tense Hour It was apparently the first time executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met directly with their counterparts at Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, which together now control more than a third of the American auto market. After a tense hour, during which the Japanese told their guests that American industry needed to transform itself radically, and the Americans warned that the time was long past when ""mere declarations of intent"" to open markets would suffice, Lee A. Iacocca, the fiery head of the ailing Chrysler Corporation, finally spoke up."
1991-12-17	Debut for Mercury-Nissan Mini-Van	"The Ford Motor Company will introduce the Mercury Villager mini-van on Tuesday in the hope of giving Mercury dealers a much needed way to attract families to their showrooms. And the model, built by Ford but designed by the Nissan Motor Company, further raises the competitive stakes for the Chrysler Corporation, whose dominance of the mini-van market may be further eroded. Frank J. Buban, sales manager of Bob Dusseau Lincoln-Mercury in Farmington, Mich., said the Mercury Sable station wagon had attracted some families, ""but if they have three or more children, they tend to want a mini-van."""
1991-11-06	Nissan-French Budapest Venture	The Nissan Motor Company said it and Magyar PGA S.A., a unit of the French car maker Pierre Guenant Automobile Motors S.A., would open a car sales company in Budapest on Wednesday. It said Magyar owned 74 percent of the new company, Nissan Hungaria R.T., and the British-based Nissan Trading Ltd. held the remainder. The company will have a French president and a Hungarian chairman; a Nissan executive is expected to be appointed vice president.
1991-09-01	Making a Difference; Promoting Basics at Nissan	There was a time when Japanese auto makers only imported vehicles to the United States. Now they build them, adapt them and, increasingly, design them here. Since joining the Nissan Motor Company in 1988, Duane F. Miller has risen to senior vice president of Nissan Research and Development, which is moving into a new research center in Farmington Hills, Mich.
1991-08-27	Faster Recharge Time For Nissan Electric Car	The Nissan Motor Corporation said today that it had developed an electric car that can be fully recharged in 15 minutes, a significant improvement over electric car batteries announced to date. But industry experts say the Japanese auto maker's latest entry in the race to develop electric cars faces numerous technical hurdles before the battery in the vehicle can be sold widely.

Nissan's Flexible, 'Thinking' Line for Auto Body Assembly"	"The auto industry is just emerging from a costly annual ritual: A month or more of downtime every summer at assembly plants from New Jersey to California as new machine tools are installed to begin producing next year's models. The changeover costs millions of dollars and cuts car companies' third-quarter profits to the bone in all but the best years. 

It is also a time for the annual automotive management seminar held by the University of Michigan.  At this year's gathering, earlier this month, the Nissan Motor Company caused a stir when it announced plans to install a flexible manufacturing system at its plant in Smyrna, Tenn."
1991-08-21	Nissan Picks TBWA For British Campaign	The Nissan Motor Company has appointed TBWA/Holmes Knight Ritchie, London, to handle advertising for its new distribution company in Britain, Nissan Motor [ GB ] . The victory had immediate implications for TBWA Advertising, New York. Nissan's account, which has estimated billings that exceed $40 million, was awarded to the agency without a review, said Daniel Ward, a company spokesman, because TBWA already was the agency of record for Nissan in other European markets.

1991-07-09	Infiniti, Lexus Lead Consumer Survey	The two newest Japanese luxury car divisions, the Nissan Motor Company's Infiniti and the Toyota Motor Corporation's Lexus, tied for the highest ranking in a consumer satisfaction survey for 1990 by J. D. Power & Associates, a leading automotive market research company. The ranking is widely regarded as an unbiased assessment of how cars and trucks perform. Manufacturers with high quality ratings aggressively use the survey in advertising and marketing in the United States. The highest-rated American car line was the Cadillac, in eighth place in this year's listing. Mercedes-Benz was third, Acura and Honda tied for fourth, Toyota sixth and Audi seventh. The survey showed the Lexus and Infiniti divisions tied at the highest level of dealer and product satisfaction since the survey was created by J. D. Power in 1986.
1991-06-01	Big 3 Charge Mini-Van Dumping	Faced with a continuing loss of sales to Japanese auto makers, the Big Three filed an anti-dumping petition with the Government today, accusing four Japanese concerns of importing mini-vans at unfairly low prices. The industry's action seemed sure to aggravate trade tensions between the United States and Japan. Although the petition focused on a relatively narrow category of vehicles, one Big Three executive who requested anonymity described it as a warning shot.
1991-05-31	Nissan's Net Off for Year	The Nissan Motor Company said today that higher costs and lagging auto sales contribuited to a 58 percent decline in earnings in the fiscal year ended March 31. The Japanese car maker said profits fell to 48.83 billion yen, or $356.42 million, from 116.01 billion yen the previous year. Sales rose 5.8 percent, to 5.97 trillion yen, or $43.54 billion, from 5.645 trillion yen.

In the 30-second spot, a driver named Bob says the road would belong to him if he could afford a sports sedan, whereupon he drives his black Sentra on to a road marked ""Bob's Expressway,"" which features ""Bob lanes"" and signs that read ""No parking except for Bob."" 

At the awards ceremony, which was held in Chicago and honored the best advertising of 1990, Ad Age also cited a one-page advertisement created by TBWA Inc. for Grand Marnier liqueur as the best magazine ad and an advertisement by the Martin Agency for Wrangler Jeans as the best newspaper ad."
1991-02-24	Chevrolet Ranks High and Low in New Crash Tests	A front-seat passenger in the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice is vulnerable to serious or even fatal head injury in a crash, while the Chevrolet Beretta's air bag and seat belts make serious injury unlikely, according to Government tests of seven new vehicles. And the test results show that both the driver and the front-seat passenger in the Chevrolet Blazer 4x4, a multipurpose vehicle, are vulnerable -- even more so than in the Caprice.
1991-02-16	Nissan Announces Export Cutbacks	"Nissan has announced sharp cutbacks in exports in the face of slumping demand for cars in the United States. Nissan's president, Yutaka Kume, said on Thursday that United States-bound exports would be scaled back in March by about 5,000 units although production levels at American plants would remain unchanged. ""Auto demand in the U.S. is in a very severe situation,"" he said. Nissan follows Mitsubishi, Honda and Mazda in scaling back exports. Japan's No. 1 auto maker, Toyota, said on Thursday that it was still studying possible adjustments to compensate for weakening United States sales. Mr. Kume said Nissan expected business for the fiscal year that will start in April to be ""rather bleak."""
1991-02-07	Ford-Nissan Mini-Van Deal	The Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury division said today that it would enter the mini-van market next year in a joint venture with the Nissan Motor Company of Japan. The first Villager mini-vans are expected to leave the Avon Lake, Ohio, plant in April 1992. The Villager will go on sale in the summer of 1992 as a 1993 model, said Ross H. Roberts, Lincoln-Mercury's general manager. Lincoln-Mercury's move reflects a broader effort by the Big Three to get into the market for mini-vans, one of the profitable areas of the slumping automobile industry. The General Motors Corporation's Oldsmobile, Chevrolet and Pontiac divisions are already in the van business. The Chrysler Corporation is the industry leader in mini- vans, holding about 50 percent of the market. Several Japanese makers, including the Mazda Motor Corporation, have introduced mini-vans. Ford already sells a mini- van under the Ford Aerostar name. The Villager will be more compact than the Aerostar. Ford's investment in the project, first announced in September 1988, is about $1 billion. Nissan has said only that its investment would be small compared with Ford's.
1991-01-19	Nissan Plans New Factory For Engines in Tennessee	The Nissan Motor Company said today that it planned to build a second plant in the United States that would make automobile engines, enabling the company to increase the domestic content of its American-assembled cars. Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker, plans to spend more than $500 million on the new plant, which will be in Decherd, Tenn. Decherd is about 60 miles from Smyrna, Tenn., where Nissan makes subcompact cars and small pickup trucks. With tensions rising again between Washington and Tokyo over Japan's huge trade surplus, Nissan's move may help blunt criticism that the company has been slow to increase the domestic content of the vehicles it assembles in this country. Domestic content covers not only components like engines and transmissions, but also all other aspects of a manufacturing operation from the labor force to the source of the food served in the employee cafeteria. Company's View of U.S. Role The announcement also strengthens Nissan's argument that the company is adding jobs and increasing the technical sophistication of its American operations.
1991-01-16	How Nissan Smooths Out the Bumps	"The Nissan Motor Corporation has introduced on its Infiniti Q-45 luxury model the first computerized suspension system in the United States that adjusts each shock absorber independently for stiffness and extension. Sensors mounted near the four wheels constantly ""read"" the car frame's height off the road, while six sensors positioned around the car monitor bounce and side-to-side motion. That information is converted to electric signals and fed into a microcomputer control unit. The controller adjusts the extension of each shock absorber by rapidly pumping hydraulic fluid into or out of the four shock absorbers. In fact, Nissan engineers say they can program the system to ""lean into"" turns like a motorcycle and compensate entirely for the centrifugal forces that act on a car as it rounds corners. But tests of the system showed that drivers were disoriented when the body roll was eliminated altogether, so Nissan engineers programmed some body roll to help drivers maintain a feel for the road. Nissan expects about 15 percent of Infiniti buyers to pay for this so-called active suspension, an option that adds $5,000 to the Q-45's $40,000 price. Other car makers will probably offer their own versions -- analysts and automotive engineers think that about 6 percent of all vehicles sold worldwide will have the systems by the year 2000, a survey by the University of Michigan has found. The active suspension system adds 132 pounds to the car and reduces mileage by about two miles a gallon. But Nissan executives say they do not expect prospective buyers to be put off by that."
1990-12-11	Nissan Curtailing Volkswagen Pact	Sales of Volkswagen's new Passat model in Japan have been too low for the Nissan Motor Company to begin assembling the cars here next year, spokesmen for the two companies said. Current sales of about 200 a month make the start-up costs for Passat production unreasonable, a Nissan spokesman said. Through its dealer network, Nissan is to continue selling Passats imported from Germany. Volkswagen had initially expected sales of about 700 a month for the Passat, introduced in May as a successor to the Santana model. The two companies said their cooperation in technology and other areas would continue.
1990-11-10	Patents; Shock Absorbers Adjust The Car to the Road	Nissan has also patented a new shock-absorbing system for cars that is designed to automatically adjust to bumpy or smooth roads. A number of companies are developing shock absorbers that try to adjust themselves by gauging road conditions. Nissan said the advantage of its invention was that it was better able to distinguish between small road irregularities, which are best met with a soft suspension, and bigger bumps that require greater stiffness.
1990-11-10	Patents; Auto Beams Shift With The Traffic	DRIVERS at night frequently fume when they are blinded by approaching cars with headlights on the high beam. Yet the need to continuously flick between high-beam and low-beam lights as traffic ebbs and flows can confuse even the most conscientious drivers. But now the Nissan Motor Company of Japan has patented an intelligent headlight that automatically adjusts the angle of its beam as it detects vehicles either in its lane in front or in oncoming traffic. The lamp would do more than merely switch from high to low, however. It would also gauge the distance to nearby cars and project light as far as possible without bothering other drivers.
1990-11-06	Japan's Rich Cars Enrich Dealers	Dealers that bet on the Japanese push into the luxury-car market are winning big. At a time when many dealerships in the United States are hurting, those selling the Lexus from Toyota, the Infiniti from Nissan and the Acura from Honda are being viewed as models both for their profitability and the lengths to which they and their car companies will go to impress customers. When Rohrich Lexus opened in Pittsburgh, it did not expect to make money for at least two years. Many analysts warned that Japanese luxury franchises might fail because dealers would be required to invest an unusually large amount -- several million dollars to build a showroom. And they would have little immediate prospect of making a profit because the brands were new and unfamiliar and there would not be much revenue from repairs or used cars, which often provide more profit than new-car business.
1990-11-06	Nissan Profit Rises 16.5%	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's No. 2 auto maker, today reported a 16.5 percent increase in net income and record domestic sales in the first half of the 1990 fiscal year. But Atsushi Muramatsu, a Nissan executive vice president, said the company might face falling consumer demand, higher costs and financing problems in the second half. He said the Tokyo stock market's plunge and the uncertainties of the gulf crisis might prompt households to reconsider spending plans. For the six months that ended Sept. 30, net income was 46.84 billion yen, or $367.8 million. Revenue rose 7 percent from a year earlier, to 2.05 trillion yen, or $16.1 billion. Worldwide, the parent company sold 1.18 million vehicles, up two-tenths of a percent. Nissan sold a record 717,915 vehicles on the domestic market, up 8.4 percent from a year earlier, but its share of the domestic market fell to 23.6 percent from 24.2 percent in the first half of the 1989 fiscal year. The company sold 462,979 vehicles abroad in the half, down 10.4 percent from a year earlier, while proceeds from the sales grew 1.3 percent, to 599.13 billion yen, or $4.7 billion.

Nissan said its profit of 38.6 billion yen, or $198.8 million, in the first half of its fiscal year, was down 55.4 percent from the 1985 April-September period -and that it was the result of sales of securities, not cars.

That was back in 1981, long before Datsuns were being called Nissans, and the company's luxury four-door had just been introduced. Five years later, the car carries on with the niceties - including its cultured female voice - that have made it Nissan's fastest-selling automobile.

IN 1947, when most of Japanese industry was struggling to recover from wartime damage and a frail economy, a self-taught engineer named Taiichi Ono was put in charge of a machining shop at the Toyota Motor Corporation's Koromo factory. He set out to help improve the company's fortunes by eliminating waste in the production process. Waste to Mr. Ono was more than rejected parts or metal shavings on the floor. He saw waste in a worker standing idle, even if only for a few seconds, or parts piled in inventory waiting to be used.

1985-08-10	THE DISAPPEARING 'U.S. CAR'	The All-American car is becoming increasingly hard to find - and the imported version increasingly hard to spot. Consider the Chevrolet, in its various manifestations. Buyers of a Chevrolet Celebrity pretty much have a domestic car, although Chevrolet executives say virtually all cars assembled in this country carry some imported parts.

It was made either by the Suzuki Motor Company or Isuzu Motors Ltd. and imported by the General Motors Corporation to compensate for G.M.'s inability to make small cars as efficiently as the Japanese.

Nissan's purchase of the Cray machine came during heightened tensions over the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, and after intense lobbying by the Reagan Administration. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige wrote to Japanese officials on Cray's behalf, after industry rumors had circulated that Nissan was under pressure to buy from Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi is closely tied to the auto company, although Nissan's own technical experts preferred Cray's machine.

Nissan thus becomes the third Japanese auto company to schedule auto production in the United States; Honda began assembling cars in Marysville, Ohio, in 1982 and Toyota is to begin joint production with General Motors in Fremont, Calif., later this year.

But the accord, which calls for Nissan to invest about $70 million in a kit- assembly plant capable of turning out some 24,000 cars a year, falls far short of earlier proposals. Nissan, which began talking with the British Government some three years ago, had at first envisioned setting up a full-scale manufacturing plant in Britain to produce 200,000 cars a year.
