In the end, Mr. Goldman held his ground, and Coke -- which owns an option to buy the rest of Honest Tea next year -- accepted the decision. The Honest Kids packaging now on store shelves continues to proclaim, ''no high fructose corn syrup'' (see the photo above). The decision, Mr. Goldman said, ''shows we do stand for something.''

2005-04-09	Marketing Isn't Just Sales	To the Editor: ''Making Room on Coke's Shelf Space'' (Business Day, April 5), about Mary E. Minnick of Coca-Cola, states that her new position ''merges two positions crucial to Coke's future: marketing and product development.''
2005-04-06	Sugar and Spice, and Biochemistry; Food Companies Test Flavorings That Can Trick the Taste Buds	Several big food and beverage companies are looking at a new ingredient in the battle for health-conscious consumers: a chemical that tricks the taste buds into sensing sugar or salt even when it is not there. Kraft Foods, Nestlé, Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup are all working with a biotechnology company called Senomyx, which has developed several chemicals, most of which do not have any flavor of their own but instead work by activating or blocking receptors in the mouth that are responsible for taste. They can enhance or replicate the taste of sugar, salt and monosodium glutamate, or MSG, in foods.
2005-04-05	Making Room on Coke's Shelf Space; The New Marketing Chief Is Likely to Steer a Less-Cola Future	To get a sense of the direction Coca-Cola is heading, consider these two drinks that the company introduced last year in Japan. There was Body Style Water, classified as a ''near water'' that is marketed to women and contains grapefruit flavor, caffeine and seaweed extract. And then there were two new varieties of Coke's enormously popular canned coffee: super caffeinated and bitter. The unit of Coke that produced these nonsoda products was overseen by Mary E. Minnick, who was just named to run marketing, product development and growth strategies at Coke's headquarters in Atlanta. With worldwide sales of Coke's flagship cola declining, analysts say that an integral part of Coke's growth over the next decade will need to come from other than traditional sodas.
2005-04-04	Watch out, giant agencies. Boutique creative shops like Nitro are winning some big clients.	AN Australian who opened a boutique creative agency in China and found fast success in Asia before expanding to Europe is now hoping to persuade Americans to buy more chocolate snacks from Mars. The game of advertising geography being played by the Australian, Chris Clarke, and his agency, Nitro, is indicative of a trend that is rapidly remaking Madison Avenue. Giant marketers like Mars, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola and Unilever are increasingly bypassing their giant agencies to award assignments to smaller, presumably nimbler, independent shops that specialize in nontraditional creative ideas.
2005-04-03	The 5-Cent Coke Goes the Way Of the Sarsaparilla	CHANGE is not something that comes quickly to Meeker's Hardware, a 122-year-old family-run business on White Street in Danbury. There's still that old register at the front desk. The well-worn wooden floor extends through a maze of aisles with seed and nail bins, barrels and rolls of barbed wire. The shelves are an eclectic mix of lighting fixtures and oil lanterns, cast iron pans and paint cans. And there are scores of 19th-century wooden drawers from which one of the Meekers will ferret out the right size bolt, screw or nut for a customer.
2005-04-01	COCA-COLA AND GREEK BOTTLER BUY RUSSIAN JUICE MAKER	The Coca-Cola Company and its Greek bottling unit will buy a Russian juice company to increase market share outside the United States. The Russian company, Multon, produces Rich, Nico and Dobry juices and controls 25 percent of the juice business, Coke and its Greek unit, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, said yesterday. Terms were not disclosed. Multon had revenue last year of $336 million. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, owns 24 percent of Coca-Cola Hellenic, which is based in Athens.
2005-02-06	Success, Built One Customer at a Time	SOMETIMES, book publishers' timing is exactly right. Everywhere you look, once-infallible marketers are flailing: AT&T never mastered how to provide cellphone service, Coca-Cola has been struggling on the supermarket shelf and Wal-Mart has a stock price that has been essentially flat for the last five years. Given all that, the time is right for advice aimed at helping marketers regain their footing. Many books arriving in stores promise just that.
2005-02-05	PEPSICO TO ADD LIME COLAS IN RESPONSE TO COKE MOVES	PepsiCo plans to introduce lime versions of its Pepsi-Cola and Diet Pepsi to try to lift soda sales. Pepsi Lime and Diet Pepsi Lime will be available by late April or May, a spokesman, Dave DeCecco, said yesterday. The Coca-Cola Company announced plans on Jan. 7 to sell Coca-Cola with Lime by March, after Diet Coke With Lime became popular last year. PepsiCo is based in Purchase, N.Y.
2005-01-11	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES NAMES PRESIDENT	Coca-Cola Enterprises, the soft drink distributor, named Terrance Marks president of its North American Group. Mr. Marks succeeds David Van Houten, who kept the job after his promotion to chief operating officer last February. Mr. Marks, 44, has been a vice president and chief revenue officer since 2003, the company said. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, sells soft drink syrup to bottlers led by Coca-Cola Enterprises, also based in Atlanta, which in turn manufacture the drinks and distribute them to retailers.
2005-01-07	HOME DEPOT CHIEF TO LEAVE COCA-COLA BOARD	Robert L. Nardelli, the chairman, president and chief executive of Home Depot, will not seek re-election as a director of the Coca-Cola Company after his term expires in the spring, Coca-Cola said yesterday. Mr. Nardelli cited increasing demands on his time at Home Depot, the world's largest home-improvement chain, for the decision. His term will expire on April 19. Mr. Nardelli has served as a director of Coca-Cola since 2002. There is no immediate plan to fill the vacant board seat, Coca-Cola said.
2004-12-23	Unauthorized campaigns used by unauthorized creators to show their creativity become a trend.	NOT long after the chief executive at Coca-Cola, E. Neville Isdell, began saying that the company needed to improve its marketing, a group of experienced hands in the ad industry decided they might be able to help. Soon a collective of creative types from many industries delivered their response, including a new campaign, brand promise and commercial for Coca-Cola using the theme, ''A Cool American.''
2004-12-20	What's in a name? Higher sales, or that's the hope of some soft-drink makers excising the word 'diet.'	DIET, schmiet. Soft-drink makers are racing to replace or play down the word ''diet'' in brand names in favor of alternative terms they hope will help fatten sales. The Coca-Cola Company kicked off the trend in September by renaming the diet version of its Sprite lemon-lime soda Diet Sprite Zero. That name will probably be changed before long to Sprite Zero, as the soda is called in more than 20 markets overseas.
2004-12-03	S.E.C. Names 8 in Kmart Accounting Case	The Securities and Exchange Commission brought accounting fraud charges yesterday against three former Kmart executives and five representatives of companies that supplied Kmart with brand-name products. Federal regulators accused the Kmart executives of prematurely booking promotional allowances from suppliers like Coca-Cola Enterprises, PepsiCo and Eastman Kodak, allowing it to increase profits for the fourth quarter of 2001 by $24 million. Representatives of at least four companies selling to Kmart participated in the accounting scheme, the complaint said, by furnishing misleading documents and making side agreements that hid the true nature of their deals from Kmart's auditors and investors.
2004-11-24	Campbell Soup is looking beyond its big agency for ideas to pump up the sales of Goldfish.	A LARGE client of Young & Rubicam Advertising in New York, the Campbell Soup Company, has quietly decided to seek ideas to promote a major product line from a far smaller agency specializing in unconventional creative approaches. The Pepperidge Farm unit of Campbell Soup has asked BrightHouse Live in Atlanta to develop concepts for advertising the Goldfish line of crackers, pretzels and other snacks, which Y.&R. Advertising, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of the WPP Group, has handled since 1998.
2004-11-23	The American owner of Bolla, the Italian wine, decides to start wooing some younger drinkers.	BOLLA is seeking to shed its staid image as a classic Italian wine in favor of a fresher, more informal approach -- ''rockin' the boat,'' as one new ad puts it. After neglecting the brand's marketing and seeing Bolla's sales suffer, the Brown-Forman Beverages division of the Brown-Forman Corporation is undertaking an ambitious revival attempt. A campaign, with a budget estimated at $12 million, includes print, outdoor, radio and Internet advertising; redesigned labels; and even a new variety, Chianti.
2004-11-22	Two Big Advertisers Make Account Changes	Two large advertisers are making account changes. The Cola-Cola Company is expanding its relationship with Berlin Cameron/Red Cell in New York, part of the Red Cell division of the WPP Group, by awarding added duties to create campaigns in North America for its flagship Coca-Cola Classic brand, an assignment the agency has handled since early last year.
2004-11-12	Coke Warns of Slack Sales for a Year or So	Coca-Cola, suffering from weak sales in North America and other important markets, said yesterday that it would sharply scale back its projections for the amount of beverages it expects to sell in future years and the profit it hopes to generate. Speaking to a group of analysts and investors at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, E. Neville Isdell, Coke's chief executive, promised to improve the company's long-term profitability eventually, but warned that 2005 would be a ''transition year.''
2004-11-12	A Wave of Spending to Try to Restore Aging Brands	In deciding yesterday to increase significantly its spending on marketing for the foreseeable future, by $350 million to $400 million a year, Coca-Cola is joining a growing number of blue-chip companies that are reversing years of cutbacks to not only defend the market shares they have but to finally start stimulating growth. ''At some point you realize you can't cut your way to greatness,'' said John Freeland, the global leader of the customer relationship marketing practice at Accenture in New York.
2004-10-28	Ovitz Queried On Expenses In Lawsuit Against Disney	After spending parts of two days testifying that he was continually sabotaged by senior managers and his boss during his brief tenure as president of the Walt Disney Company, Michael S. Ovitz, the former president, found himself on the defensive late Wednesday about his continuing relationship with the talent agency he had left for Disney. Steven G. Schulman, the lawyer for Disney shareholders suing over the board's handling of Mr. Ovitz's controversial tenure in the mid-1990's, attacked one of the tenets of Mr. Ovitz's defense: that he gave up a lucrative career at Creative Artists Agency after 21 years to join Disney in 1995.
2004-10-25	It's the Soccer Leagues vs. British Newspapers in a Skirmish Over Photos	Most British soccer fans are content with a full-blooded clash of archrivals, like Manchester United against Arsenal. But the fiercest competition these days is between Britain's major soccer leagues and its daily newspapers, which are battling each other over game photos.
2004-10-22	COCA-COLA'S PROFIT FALLS 24% AS SALES DECLINE	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings fell 24 percent as higher prices hurt sales in the United States and Europe. Net income fell to $935 million, or 39 cents a share, from $1.22 billion, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales fell 0.2 percent to $5.66 billion. Ineffective advertising, price increases and a work force suffering from poor morale have hurt sales in the United States, the company's biggest market, the chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, said. Some improvements in operations and new products will not occur until 2006, he said in a conference call with investors. Coca-Cola is based in Atlanta.
2004-10-21	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in World Business yesterday about the Coca-Cola Company's settlement of an antitrust case in Europe misstated the market share of PepsiCo, its top rival, for carbonated soft drinks in the United States. It is 31.8 percent, not 38 percent. (Coke has 44 percent.)
2004-10-20	Coke and Europeans Settle Antitrust Case	Settling a five-year antitrust investigation, the Coca-Cola Company reached an agreement Tuesday that would change the way it does business in Europe, Mario Monti, the departing competition commissioner, said. The agreement was presented at a meeting here by the Coca-Cola chairman, E. Neville Isdell, who handed Mr. Monti the company's offer to desist from practices that European regulators contend undermine competition.
2004-10-09	World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Soft Drink Investigation	The Coca-Cola Company and its Brazilian bottler, Indústria Brasileira de Bebidas, will be investigated by the antitrust arm of the Justice Ministry on accusations that they tried to force competitors out of the market, the ministry said. The Justice Ministry will investigate allegations by a Brazilian soft drink maker, Ragi Refrigerantes, that Coca-Cola tried to drive out competitors by forbidding suppliers to sell to them, the ministry said. Ragi makes Dolly soft drinks. The Brazilian unit of Coke, which has 22 percent of the country's nonalcoholic beverage market, said it would provide information to show that the accusations were part of ''a defamation campaign orchestrated by the owner of Dolly.''
2004-10-05	Next Time, Try Water, Mate	Kangaroo hunting and Coca-Cola don't mix -- at least when you drink more than two gallons of it while scouring the outback in the blazing heat. That was the conclusion of a case study published Saturday in The Lancet, a medical journal. It described an Australian ostrich farmer who was overcome by weakness after an evening of shooting kangaroos, which ''are considered agricultural pests'' in that region of the country, the study said.
2004-10-03	In Perfect Harmony and Now in High-Def	IN 1971, the Coca-Cola Company created a masterpiece of naïve multiculturalism: the commercial that featured ''I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke.'' The ad's internationalist aesthetic served in part to play down Coke's association with the United States. For years, the company -- and its advertising agency, McCann Erickson -- had been insisting on the worldliness of the brand, making much of its ambassadorial presence in cities from Cairo to Venice. But by the late 60's, with the introduction of the promiscuously translatable slogan, ''It's the Real Thing,'' Coca-Cola appeared prepared to go a step further, to minimize its connection to a country that might not be universally perceived as fun and refreshing. Coke aimed to be stateless. The ad is regarded by connoisseurs as a beauty, and Coke routinely champions it as the most beloved commercial of all time. It's fitting, then, that to commemorate the life of one of the song's writers, Billy Davis, who died last month, the ad has been remastered for high-definition television -- a first in the history of Coke's advertising, which the company considers one of its most exciting products (all Coke ads are eventually donated to the Library of Congress).
2004-09-28	All Is Not Sweet at the Home Base of Coca-Cola	In late June, just a few weeks after coming out of retirement to become the Coca-Cola Company's latest chief executive, E. Neville Isdell visited Coke's regional managers in China. He remembers one in particular, a young woman named Lily, on the job less than three years and radiating zeal and spunk. ''She reminded me of myself at her age, just full of enthusiasm for the business and the brand,'' Mr. Isdell, 61, said. Fast-forward to Sept. 15, the day Coke warned investors that this year's earnings would be lower than they had expected. Mr. Isdell walked through Coke's Atlanta headquarters, and the miasma of gloom was palpable. ''No one would make eye contact with me,'' he recalled. ''The trust has been broken, and the culture needs regeneration.''
2004-09-26	Bittersweet Taste of Change	Any reluctance to change on the part of Sergio Zyman would be understandable. Yet Mr. Zyman, who managed one of the most ill-fated marketing moves ever, the introduction of New Coke, remains a relentless proselytizer of repositioning the images of products and services. ''Companies have to constantly figure out who they are and where they are in relation to the competition,'' said Mr. Zyman, 59, who retired from Coca-Cola for the second time in 1998. ''You may not need a whole new brand, just some tweaking.'' He opened a consulting firm in Atlanta called the Zyman Group, which now has more than 100 employees and a client list including the Blockbuster video chain, ConAgra Foods and Callaway Golf.
2004-09-18	COCA-COLA CHIEF TO BE PAID LESS THAN PREDECESSOR	The Coca-Cola Company set the salary and bonus of its chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, at $4.5 million, less than his predecessor's, amid sluggish sales, the company said in a regulatory filing. The company will pay Mr. Isdell a base salary of $1.5 million and a bonus of up to $3 million, Coca-Cola said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The salary and bonus are in addition to a previously announced award of 450,000 stock options and a one-time restricted stock award of 140,000 shares. Mr. Isdell returned to Coca-Cola in June to succeed Douglas N. Daft, who retired; Mr. Daft earned a salary and bonus of $5.5 million in 2003. Mr. Isdell said on Wednesday that Coca-Cola needed to take ''corrective actions'' after the company forecast that second-half earnings would decline because of sluggish sales.
2004-09-16	Shares Decline, Pulled Down by Reduced Profit Forecasts	Shares dropped yesterday after the Coca-Cola Company and Xilinx Inc., the world's biggest producer of programmable semiconductors, said that results would miss estimates, continuing a trend of reduced forecasts for the third quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average had its biggest decline in a month, shedding 86.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,231.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.96 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,120.37. The decline, the largest this month, ended four days of advances. The Nasdaq composite index fell 18.88 points, or 1 percent, to 1,896.52.
2004-09-16	Coke Says 2nd-Half Profit Will Fall Short	The Coca-Cola Company warned yesterday that its earnings for the second half of the year would fall short of forecasts, citing competitive pressures in North America and unseasonably cool and rainy weather in Europe. The warning is the first setback for Coke's chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, who came out of retirement in June to assume the top post.
2004-09-09	Coca-Cola Unit Trims Forecast	Coca-Cola Enterprises, the soft drink distributor, said yesterday that earnings this year would fall more than it expected because higher prices and cooler weather were hurting sales. Profit will be as little as $1.21 a share, Coca-Cola Enterprises said. That compares with the company's July forecast of about $1.43 and last year's net income of $676 million, or $1.46 a share.
2004-09-07	World Business Briefing | Europe: Belgium: Progress For Coke In Inquiry	The Coca-Cola Company moved closer to settling a five-year European Commission antitrust inquiry after regulators said yesterday that an offer from the company to revamp its sales practices was very good. ''The commission is very satisfied with what is on the table,'' commission spokesman Tilman Lueder said about Coca-Cola's offer last week to make changes to its practices in Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark and Germany. The commission will consult major customers and competitors for their reaction, he said. The European Union began an inquiry in 1999, after a complaint by a rival PepsiCo Inc. into whether Coca-Cola was using rebates to persuade retailers to keep competing products off their shelves.
2004-09-04	COCA-COLA OFFERS TO SETTLE ANTITRUST CASE IN EUROPE	Coca-Cola offered to change the way it sells beverages in Britain and four European countries to settle a five-year-old antitrust investigation. The European Commission is circulating the proposal among competitors and customers for their comments, Coca-Cola said in a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A Coca-Cola spokesman, Ben Deutsch, declined to elaborate. The investigation began in 1999 and covers Britain, Germany, Austria, Belgium and Denmark. It focuses on Coca-Cola's practice of offering rebates tied to sales volume. Coke's rival, PepsiCo, instigated the investigation with a complaint about Coke's sales practices and is reviewing the proposal.
2004-09-02	Whose ketchup will get your vote? Popular brands bring levity to a tense presidential campaign.	THE race for the White House is turning into a brandapalooza for marketers as products and ad slogans assume increasingly prominent roles in the campaign -- almost as if this were the first officially sponsored presidential election. Thanks to Teresa Heinz Kerry, the wife of the Democratic candidate, Senator John Kerry, the foremost campaign brand by far is Heinz ketchup, as typified by a question asked by Jon Stewart, the host of ''The Daily Show,'' when Mr. Kerry appeared on the program Aug. 24: ''Is it true that every time I use ketchup, your wife gets a nickel?'' (Mr. Kerry's reply: ''Would that it were.'')
2013-12-23	PEPSICO WINS BEVERAGE CONTRACT FROM QUIZNOS	PepsiCo Inc., which lost Subway Restaurants as a major fountain customer last year to Coca-Cola, has won the United States beverage and snack business of the Quiznos Corporation. The agreement, which covers 3,600 restaurants, will end the sandwich chain's 23-year relationship with Coke. Quiznos already sells snacks from Frito-Lay, a PepsiCo unit, alongside other brands. Frito-Lay is expected to make up a larger percentage of Quiznos's business under the new deal. The conversion to Pepsi soft drinks and noncarbonated drinks will start early next year.
2004-08-04	Driver Is Fined for Nascar Ad Cover-Up	A Nascar driver, Jimmie Johnson, who is sponsored by PepsiCo Inc., was fined $10,000 for covering a bottle of the Coca-Cola Company's Powerade sports drink with a sign after he won the Pennsylvania 500 on Sunday. Mr. Johnson climbed from his car on victory lane while surrounded by media and placed a sign for the Lowe's Companies, his primary sponsor, in front of a bottle of Powerade Nascar officials had placed on his car.
2004-07-23	Coca-Cola Says That Earnings Rose 16% in the 2nd Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest soft drink maker, said yesterday that second-quarter earnings climbed 16 percent because of higher demand for diet drinks in North America and rising sales in Asian markets, led by China. Net income rose to $1.58 billion, or 65 cents a share, from $1.36 billion, or 55 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales increased 4.7 percent, to $5.97 billion, the smallest gain in more than two years.
2004-07-16	Coke European Accord Seen	The European Commission is set to announce a settlement of a three-year antitrust investigation of Coca-Cola, a person involved in the inquiry said Thursday. Coca-Cola has offered to drop its requirement that retailers stock a wide array of Coke and Fanta drinks, which come in a number of flavors and take up a large amount of shelf space. Currently, retailers must take the whole range of drinks to qualify for a rebate from the company.
2004-07-04	The Relentless Pursuit of Less	AAH, minimalism. The pause that refreshes. What makes looking at the stark white-on-white abstractions of Robert Ryman so transcendent is in part the feeling that you have hit a giant escape key. The blank-screen effect is a state of mind that other artists have mused on, too. Andy Warhol, for one, once said, ''My mind is like a tape recorder with one button -- erase.''
2004-06-27	Things Go Better With Bingooo, Qoo And Many Megapixels	The suspense! The megapixels! Manhattan is counting down to the unveiling on Thursday of Coca-Cola's new Times Square sign, with its 80,000 feet of wiring, six video processors and more megapixels than there are humans in San Francisco. Why would Coke spend $6.5 million to put up an unthinkably complex 30-ton ad? Well, to echo Bill Clinton on why he fell into that unfortunate indiscretion, because it can. And because it's Times Square, which swats away moderation as if it were a pesky gnat. And because 100 years ago, one Arthur Pratt delivered the first case of Coke by horse and wagon. And, yes, because Coke is introducing its C2 low-calorie brand.
2004-06-27	Page Two: June 20-26; Next Up: Low-Carb Nachos?	THE low-carbohydrate diet craze, which has already transformed American eating habits, is going to work on that quintessential junk food, soda. Coca-Cola and Pepsi- Co this month began marketing two ''mid-carb'' sodas, C2 and Edge, which combine dietetic sweeteners with high fructose corn syrup to create, the companies claim, products that taste like regular colas, but with half the calories. Growth in the $60 billion-a-year soda business has slowed to a crawl, in part because lowcarb regimens like the Atkins diet have driven consumers to bottled water or fruit juice. The soft-drink giants now want to win them back.
2004-06-25	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about management changes at Coca-Cola misidentified its chairman. He is E. Neville Isdell; Donald R. Keough is a director who headed the search committee that recruited Mr. Isdell.
2004-06-23	Coke Names a New Head of Marketing	Again mining the past to shape the future, E. Neville Isdell, the Coca-Cola Company's chief executive, named Charles B. Fruit, who has been at Coke for 13 years, as chief marketing officer. Mr. Fruit, 57, will succeed Daniel P. Palumbo, 46, who joined the company last June, shortly after leaving his post as president of the Eastman Kodak Company's consumer imaging-products unit.

But just wait till they light the lights.
2004-06-18	Executive Parachutes	To the Editor: Re ''Another Coke Classic'' (editorial, June 16): Perhaps we should also question the practice of giving enormous payoffs to any executive departing for poor performance. Most employees who get fired for being unqualified or inadequate are not given golden parachutes, so why should executives? GRÉGOIRE LANDEL New York, June 16, 2004
2004-06-16	Another Coke Classic	Coke, America's most iconic brand, no longer seems to be it, or even the real thing. It isn't just Coca-Cola's lackluster performance that is worrisome. After all the attention placed on corporate governance in the post-Enron world, this blue-chip company's blue-chip board has become a weak guardian of shareholder interests. The board does not seem to have noticed that doling out tens of millions of shareholder dollars for mediocre results is no longer in vogue. The company has paid out more than $200 million in recent years to departing executives, most prominently to its former chief executives Douglas Ivester and Douglas Daft. Steven Heyer will be the latest executive to leave Coke with a smile after a disappointing tenure. Mr. Heyer, the 51-year-old president and chief operating officer, was passed over in a very public search for a new chief executive. He will receive severance pay of at least $24 million for his three years of service. Mr. Heyer had been considered the heir apparent, but the top job went instead to Neville Isdell, a Coke veteran who now becomes the third chief executive in seven years. Mr. Heyer's imminent departure from the company was announced last week.
2004-06-10	Coke's President to Quit After Being Passed Over For Company's Top Job	A month after being passed over for the top job, Steven J. Heyer, the president and chief operating officer of Coca-Cola, said yesterday that he would leave the company. Mr. Heyer, a marketing wizard who joined the company in 2001, was once considered the heir apparent to the previous chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, but he lost out to a longtime Coke employee, E. Neville Isdell, after a protracted search. Mr. Isdell said in a statement that the two had reached a ''mutual agreement'' on Tuesday that would lead to Mr. Heyer's departure from Coke after ''an orderly transition'' in the next several months.
2004-06-02	World Business Briefing | Europe: Brussels: Investigation Advances	The European Commission threatened to open legal proceedings against Coca-Cola later this month if the company failed to address the antitrust concerns the commission has been investigating for five years, a spokesman said. If no settlement is reached in the next couple weeks the commission will send Coca-Cola a statement of objections, the spokesman, Tilman Lueder, said. Coca-Cola has intensified its efforts to avert legal action in recent months. Settlement talks are believed to be focused on Coca-Cola's practice of paying retailers rebates in return for ensuring prominent shelf space for its weaker brands. Paul Meller (NYT)
2004-05-19	Executive Insists He'll Stay as Coke's No. 2	Steven J. Heyer, the president of the Coca-Cola Company who was recently passed over in favor of E. Neville Isdell for the chief executive's job, insisted yesterday that he intended to stay on at Coke as Mr. Isdell's No. 2. But his words did little to dispel widespread speculation that he would soon be leaving the company. ''Neville's a terrific guy. He understands the system, and we'll be great partners,'' Mr. Heyer, 51, told a conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs in New York.
2004-05-06	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the appointment of a chief executive at the Coca-Cola Company misspelled the name of the recruiting firm that conducted the search. It is Heidrick & Struggles, not Heidrich. The article also misstated the surname of an actress who has appeared in Coke commercials recently. She is Salma Hayek, not Hayak.
2004-05-05	Coca-Cola Reaches Into Past for New Chief	Once again, the Coca-Cola Company has dipped into its past in search of its future. Yesterday the company announced that E. Neville Isdell, who left Coke at the end of 2001 after 35 years with the company, would return as its chief executive when Douglas N. Daft retires this summer. Mr. Isdell had been passed over before for the top job at Coke, but he professed to feel no resentment over past slights. ''I've been outside the system for two years,'' he said, ''and that has made me far better prepared to lead this company than I was in the past.''
2004-04-20	HEALTH-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS WILL HAVE A NEW COLA	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would sell a version of its flagship cola with half the calories and carbohydrates to increase demand among health-conscious consumers who do not like diet sodas. The new drink, Coca-Cola C2, will be introduced in Japan and then in the United States this summer, the company said. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, took more than a year to develop the new beverage. C2 is Coca-Cola's fifth new cola product since 2001. Coca-Cola's rival PepsiCo is planning to introduce a mid-calorie drink, Pepsi Edge, in August.
2004-04-13	Executive Quits as Turmoil Continues at Coke	In a development that analysts said reflected continuing political turmoil and infighting at the Coca-Cola Company, Deval L. Patrick, the general counsel for three years, has resigned, the company said. Mr. Patrick's interim successor will be Geoff Kelly, who has been at Coke for 34 years. Previously, Mr. Kelly was senior vice president and chief deputy counsel.
2004-04-05	Coke's 'Old Guard'	To the Editor: In ''Analysts Question Value of Coke's Old Guard'' (Business Day, March 20), you suggest that age prevents the board members who make up our chief executive selection committee from making a significant contribution; and specifically that age impairs them from making the best decision for our shareowners regarding the selection of my successor. This viewpoint borders on discriminatory and is certainly naïve.
2004-03-29	With sales flagging, Evian is painting its water as a source of beauty, youth and health.	TWENTY years ago, most Americans bought bottles of water only when they feared contamination in the water supply. Today, bottled water is hugely popular and aggressively advertised, in large part because of the entry in the last decade of PepsiCo, with its Aquafina brand, and the Coca-Cola Company, with Dasani.
2004-03-28	Sprite ReMix	One thing that consumer brands are supposed to be is reliable. That's how you build loyalty. A Coke, a Pepsi, a Sprite -- these are soda brands whose flavors are much as they have always been, because that's what you, the soda drinker, expect; it's what you're loyal to. Last year, a spinoff from Sprite called Sprite ReMix made its way into the market, offering drinkers a ''tropical'' take on Sprite's flavor. It seems to have got off to a good start, selling 55 million cases in 2003 -- a very respectable debut, according to John Sicher, publisher of the Beverage Digest newsletter. But there will be no building of loyalty to the tropical flavor, because it's being done away with: Sprite ReMix, the name, will carry on, but it won't taste the same. A complete flavor overhaul after just a year may sound like triage for a flat-lining product, but in fact, the short life of tropical ReMix was all part of the plan, which also calls for the new variation, Berryclear, to disappear about a year from now and be replaced by some other taste. ''The strategy,'' said John Carroll, Sprite group director, ''is to always change.'' And loyalty? Well, loyalty isn't what it used to be. If it were, there might never have been a ReMix.
2004-03-20	Coke Recalls Bottled Water Newly Introduced to Britain	Only weeks after it introduced Dasani bottled water into Britain, the Coca-Cola Company ordered a recall of some 500,000 bottles on Friday after finding excess levels of bromate. The chemical, with long-term exposure, has been linked to a higher risk of cancer. Dasani is the second-biggest-selling bottled drinking water in the United States after Aquafina from PepsiCo Inc. Newspapers here mocked Coca-Cola for charging up to $1.80 for a small bottle of purified tap water when it was introduced in January.
2004-03-20	Analysts Question Value of Coke's Old Guard	As the Coca-Cola Company searches for a new chairman and chief executive, some investors and analysts are as concerned with who is doing the looking as with who will ultimately be chosen. The selection committee is so dominated by longtime insiders -- on the panel are Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (which owns more than 8 percent of Coke's shares), and Donald R. Keough, a former Coke president -- that it could be nicknamed Coca-Cola Classic. The problem, analysts said, is the inordinate amount of power in the hands of the old guard -- which has run through two chief executives in seven years with little improvement in company fortunes.
2004-03-03	World Briefing | Europe: Britain: Coke Questioned On Bottled Tap	Britons harrumphed when they discovered that a brand of bottled water introduced by Coca-Cola was no more than, well, water. The new brand, Dasani, is the second-biggest seller in the United States. But when British newspapers discovered that it was tap water purified in south London, they complained. ''It's the real thing -- Coke's tap-water from Sidcup,'' sniped the London Times. Others said the price -- up to $1.77 a bottle -- was several thousand times higher than tap water itself. Coca-Cola said its product was ''compliant with all guidelines and regulations.'' But the regulatory Food Standards Agency asked local authorities to investigate whether the company was entitled to use the word ''pure'' on Dasani labels. Alan Cowell (NYT)
2004-02-26	Market Place; A promotion adds to speculation on who will be Coke's next leader.	THE management shuffle at the Coca-Cola Company continued yesterday as Donald R. Knauss, the head of the North American retail division, was named president of the entire North American business. The job had been held by Steven J. Heyer, who is Coke's president and chief operating officer and a candidate for the company's top job.
2004-02-21	Hunt for Chief Raises Questions for Coke	A day after Douglas N. Daft, the Coca-Cola Company's chairman and chief executive, announced he would retire at the end of the year, analysts questioned the timing of the resignation and debated the effect it could have on Steven J. Heyer, Coke's president and chief operating officer, who has long been considered the heir apparent to Mr. Daft. Coke's board said Thursday that it would move swiftly to name a chairman and chief executive by the end of the year. But it also said it would hire a search firm to evaluate candidates outside of the company, fueling speculation that Mr. Heyer might not get the job.
2004-02-21	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the retirement plans of Douglas N. Daft, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, misspelled the surname of a new director in some copies and misstated his age. He is Donald R. Keough, not Keogh; he is 77, not 76.
2004-02-20	Coke's Chief Set to Retire at End of 2004	After a year of embarrassments, investigations and lackluster earnings, Douglas N. Daft, chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, said yesterday that he would retire at the end of the year. His announcement, which ends months of speculation, is in keeping with what he said were his longstanding plans to retire after five years on the job. The speculation will now turn to who will succeed him in running one of the world's best-known brands.
2004-01-31	Coke Employees Are Questioned In Fraud Inquiry	Federal investigators are questioning current and former employees of the Coca-Cola Company about accusations that the company inflated its sales figures by selling surplus beverage concentrate in several big international markets including Japan, people close to the investigations said. The United States attorney's office in Atlanta, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the F.B.I. have been investigating Coke since May, when a former Coke employee filed a lawsuit contending that the company committed accounting fraud and increased revenue by shipping excessive concentrate -- a practice known as ''channel stuffing'' -- to bottlers in Japan and elsewhere.
2004-01-15	S.E.C. Regulators Are Investigating Coke	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it was being formally investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accusations levied against the company last year in a wrongful termination lawsuit. The investigation stems from a $44.4 million lawsuit filed in May by Matthew Whitley, a former finance director in Coke's fountain unit who accused Coke of committing $2 billion in accounting fraud, discriminating against minorities and women and manipulating inventories.
2004-01-11	Dracula Theme Park: Idea That Just Won't Die	NO one knows Vlad the Impaler's drinking tastes beyond, well, his favorite refreshment. Yet a beer brewer and a soft-drink bottler are two early sponsors of a proposed theme park in Romania to be built around the character of Dracula. The park would include a golf course, a water park, some Dracula-inspired rides and a variety of other family attractions, on a site just north of Bucharest rather than in Vlad's native Transylvania.
2003-12-19	Coke's North American Unit Loses Chief Amid Slow Growth	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that Jeffery T. Dunn, the president and chief operating officer of Coke's North American division, is leaving to pursue ''his own entrepreneurial goals.'' Steven J. Heyer, the Coca-Cola Company president and chief operating officer, will assume Mr. Dunn's responsibilities immediately, the company said. Mr. Dunn's departure was widely anticipated in the industry, analysts said, particularly after Coke executives said last week that they were disappointed with North American sales, which account for about 30 percent of the company's business. Some analysts said Coke executives had simply lost patience with Mr. Dunn's progress.
2003-12-17	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES PROMOTES ITS PRESIDENT	Coca-Cola Enterprises, the soft drink bottler, promoted its president and chief operating officer, John R. Alm, to chief executive, replacing Lowry F. Kline, who is stepping down after less than three years. Mr. Kline, 63, will remain chairman and keep management duties, the company said. The changes are effective Jan. 1. Mr. Alm, 57, president since 2000, was passed over for the top spot in April 2001 when Mr. Kline got the job. Mr. Alm has represented Coca-Cola Enterprises in meetings with the Coca-Cola Company that were aimed at developing innovative packages and increasing impulse purchases of soft drinks at higher prices.
2003-12-13	COCA-COLA PLANS TO BUY BACK $2 BILLION IN STOCK	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it planned to buy back at least $2 billion in stock next year, increasing its share repurchase plan by a third as rising sales and a falling dollar help profit. Coca-Cola still expects to increase earnings per share at least 11 percent a year, the company said, without giving a specific forecast. The company said in October that it planned to repurchase $1.5 billion in stock this year. Next year's $2 billion plan would allow Coca-Cola to buy more than 41 million shares at the current price, representing almost 2 percent of outstanding stock.
2003-12-05	World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Bottled Water Entry	The Coca-Cola Company said it would enter the French bottled water market with its Dasani brand in the spring. Coca-Cola will compete with Nestlé, Danone and Neptune, which control 70 percent of the French bottled water market. Ariane Bernard (NYT)
2003-11-27	Subway Chain Chooses Coke, Displacing Pepsi	In the latest volley of the cola wars, the Coca-Cola Company announced a deal yesterday to become the exclusive supplier of fountain drinks to Subway Restaurants, wooing the chain away from its partnership with the Pepsi unit of PepsiCo. The deal, which will put Coke fountain drinks in Subway's 20,000 restaurants around the world, will be effective in 2005. Pepsi had been the primary provider of fountain drinks served in the Subway chain since 1988, although Coca-Cola did supply about 15 percent of the restaurants with fountain drinks, bottles and cans.
2003-11-26	Accounts	The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, to the Shanghai office of the Starcom MediaVest Group, part of the Publicis Groupe, to handle media planning and buying in China. The assignment, with billings estimated at $30 million, had been handled by a Publicis sibling, ZenithOptimedia. The shift came after Coca-Cola consolidated media planning and buying for North American brands.
2003-11-25	Coca-Cola Dismisses Universal McCann	The Coca-Cola Company delivered a blow to the Interpublic Group of Companies yesterday by dismissing the Universal McCann agency owned by Interpublic from a significant assignment in North America. Coca-Cola consolidated media planning and buying for all soft drink and juice brands in North America, shifting them to a Universal McCann competitor, the Starcom MediaVest Group of the Publicis Groupe. Spending was estimated at $300 million to $400 million, making the consolidation one of the biggest for media accounts in recent years.
2003-10-28	COCA-COLA RAISES TOTAL OF JOB CUTS TO 2,800	Coca-Cola said in a government filing yesterday that it would eliminate 900 additional jobs, mainly by closing a 275-employee juice plant in Hightstown, N.J., and combining bottling operations in Asia. The company raised its planned job cuts to 2,800 from a previously announced 1,900, the company said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
2003-10-22	Charles E. F. Millard, 71, Executive Who Led Growth at Coca-Cola Bottling	Charles E. F. Millard, who as chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York fought for bottler's rights and led the company through a period of sharp growth, died Monday at his home in Fenwick, Conn., near Old Saybrook. He was 71. The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his son, Charles E. F. Millard Jr., said.
2003-10-17	Coca-Cola Earnings Rise 12% on Some Strong International Sales	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its third-quarter profit increased 12 percent, largely because of strong sales in some of its most important international markets like Britain and Spain. A lower tax rate and favorable currency exchange rates also helped to lift earnings, the company said.
2003-10-08	Coca-Cola Settles Whistle-Blower Suit for $540,000	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had reached a $540,000 settlement with a former executive who filed a lawsuit against the company asserting that he was fired after he raised concerns about accounting fraud and a rigged marketing test in Burger King restaurants. Under the terms of the agreement, the employee, Matthew Whitley, will receive $100,000 in cash, approximately $140,000 in severance benefits, including health insurance, and $300,000 to pay lawyer's fees. Mr. Whitley has also agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are investigating possible improper business practices at Coke. Neither Coke nor Mr. Whitley would comment further on the settlement.
2003-10-07	Miscellany	Marketing Metrics, Paramus, N.J., a specialist in customer relationship management research, was acquired by Ipsos, Paris, which will market its services worldwide under the Ipsos Loyalty name. Terms were not disclosed. Fallon Worldwide, Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe, acquired Gram Advertising, Tokyo, which was renamed Fallon Tokyo. Terms were not disclosed. The Tokyo office joins Fallon offices in Hong Kong, London, New York, São Paulo and Singapore in addition to the Minneapolis headquarters.
2003-10-06	Two TiVo Agreements Are Untraditional Kind	TiVo in San Jose, Calif., has signed two advertisers to major deals that are indicative of the efforts by marketers to find ways to reach consumers apart from traditional TV advertising. Terms were not disclosed. The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta agreed to sponsor a monthly, 25-minute music program, ''Sound Check,'' available only to TiVo subscribers. Music from artists like Ashanti and Sting will be provided by the Interscope Geffen A&M division of the Universal Music Group, which is owned by Vivendi Universal. TiVo subscribers who click on a symbol superimposed on screen during Coca-Cola commercials can use their remote controls to schedule ''Sound Check'' for recording.
2003-09-30	McCann Loses 2 Coke Accounts	Offices of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising have lost two assignments to create campaigns for the flagship soft drink brand of the Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola expanded its relationship with Mother in London by naming the agency to handle the Coca-Cola brand assignment in England and Ireland, which had been handled by the London office of McCann-Erickson. Billings were estimated at $40 million. Mother already creates campaigns for four company brands. McCann-Erickson will continue creating campaigns for Cherry Coke and Vanilla Coke.
2003-09-17	Coca-Cola Decides To Consolidate Work	The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta has decided to consolidate the North American media planning and buying assignments for all its soda and juice brands, with total spending estimated at $300 million to $400 million. The assignments, now divided among three agencies, have been placed in review. The three incumbents will take part in the review along with two agencies that do not now handle media assignments for Coca-Cola. The incumbents are Universal McCann, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which handles the media buying, and two units of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe: MediaVest Worldwide, which handles the media planning for soft drinks, and Starcom Worldwide, which handles the planning for Minute Maid juices.
2003-09-03	Coke Moves With Caution To Remain In Schools	In July, the Coca-Cola Company publicly vowed to roll back all of its marketing efforts to children under 12: no television ads; no free coupons; and no giveaways like book covers emblazoned with the company's logo. But Coke has not disappeared from the lives of schoolchildren. In June, consumer groups and some parents were dismayed when Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's largest bottler, became an official sponsor of the National PTA. What was not widely known at the time was that the PTA had also given John H. Downs Jr., the bottler's senior vice president for public affairs and its chief lobbyist, a seat on its board.
2003-08-27	Coke Endorses Ideas For Promoting Sprite	After soliciting proposals for campaigns for Sprite soda from agencies that do not handle the account, the Coca-Cola Company has decided to work with ideas from Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, which has handled the account since 2001. The decision by Coca-Cola ended an unusual monthlong effort that pitted the proposals from Ogilvy, part of the WPP Group, against ideas from four independent agencies: DiNoto in New York; Modernista in Boston; Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which creates campaigns for the Powerade drink sold by Coca-Cola; and Wong Doody in Seattle.
2003-08-26	Tricking The Taste Buds: Science Seeks Sweet Disguise	The food industry, trying to offer healthier versions of popular foods without affecting the taste, is looking for new ways to trick the tongue. If it succeeds, grapefruit juice could be sweet without added sugar, and potato chips flavorful with half the salt. In April the Linguagen Corporation, a biotechnology company in Cranbury, N.J., that is conducting taste research, received a patent for the first molecular compound that will block bitter tastes in foods, beverages and some pharmaceuticals. The compound, named adenosine 5'-monophosphate, or AMP, occurs naturally -- it is found in human breast milk, among other places. When added to certain foods, including coffee and canned citrus fruit, Linguagen says, it blocks some of the acidic tastes from being absorbed by the tongue.
2003-08-26	Market Place; A Coke executive will leave his job in the wake of a rigged market test at Burger King.	IN an effort to end an embarrassing chapter in its domestic business, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that the head of its fountain division had agreed to step down. The executive, Tom Moore, who had served as president of Coke's Foodservice and Hospitality Division since 1999, led the division when it rigged a marketing test for Coke products sold at Burger King. Mr. Moore, 46, will continue to work at the company in a transitional role for an undetermined amount of time, the company said.
2003-08-23	India Tries to Contain Tempest Over Soft Drink Safety	There have been few such long-winded efforts to say that Coke is still it. Throughout the capital's bustling INA market, which sells everything from Oreo cookies made in China to ''Hot Eats'' of North India, soft drink vendors had posted fliers this week proclaiming that ''Coca-Cola refreshes you with world-class and safe products in India.''
2003-08-22	World Briefing | Asia: India: New Tests On Colas	The minister of health told the Parliament that tests on 12 samples of drinks produced locally by Pepsi and Coca-Cola revealed marginally higher levels of pesticides than those acceptable under European Union standards on 9 of the samples but that the levels were not as high as earlier testing by a nongovernmental environmental organization had indicated. Officials from Pepsi and Coca-Cola said they felt the new tests had vindicated their stance that the sodas sold in India were as safe as those sold elsewhere in the world. Sanjiv Gupta, president of Coca-Cola India, above, expressed his satisfaction with the news. Sales of soft drinks produced by both companies have dropped markedly since the environmental group released its tests this month. Amy Waldman (NYT)
2003-08-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Soft Drinks Cleared	India's government said tests of samples of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo products showed that they conformed to safety standards. The health minister, Sushma Swaraj, told Parliament that tests were conducted by state-run laboratories on 12 beverage samples. ''They were well within the safety limits prescribed for packaged drinking water at present,'' Ms. Swaraj said. The government ordered the tests after a group called the Center for Science and Environment charged that the drinks contained pesticide residue. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2003-08-22	Coke Signs Deal With N.B.A. Rookie	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had signed a six-year endorsement deal with LeBron James, the National Basketball Association rookie, calling for him to pitch two beverage brands, Powerade and Sprite. Though the financial terms were not disclosed, the deal is estimated to be worth more than $2 million each year. Mr. James, 18, may serve as insurance of sorts for Coca-Cola against any additional bad publicity for Kobe Bryant, the basketball star who is under contract to endorse Sprite through 2005. Mr. Bryant was charged last month with sexual assault, an accusation he denies. Sprite commercials featuring Mr. Bryant are not running, Coca-Cola has said, because the company is focused on bringing out a new variety, Sprite Remix, with different ads.
2003-08-16	Coke Equipment Supplier Cooperating in U.S. Inquiry	The Lancer Corporation, a major equipment supplier to the Coca-Cola Company, said today that federal prosecutors in Atlanta had sought information from the company in connection with a criminal investigation involving Coke. Lancer, based in San Antonio, said in a statement that it intended to cooperate with federal investigators. The United States attorney's office in Atlanta is investigating fraud accusations raised by a former Coke employee who is suing the company in state and federal court for wrongful termination.
2003-08-13	Coke to Pay Burger King $21 Million Over Rigged Test	The Burger King Corporation said yesterday that the Coca-Cola Company had agreed to pay up to $21.1 million for rigging a marketing test at its restaurants. The companies reached a resolution on the issue earlier this month. But Coke and Burger King declined then to provide specific information on the terms of the deal, saying only that Burger King would remain a Coke client.
2003-08-02	Coke Makes Up With Burger King Over Rigged Test Of Frozen Drink	Sweeping aside one of the more embarrassing episodes it has faced recently, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had resolved its differences with Burger King over a rigged marketing test. In June, Coca-Cola admitted to manipulating a marketing test for Frozen Coke -- a slushy version of Coke -- in Burger King restaurants. Neither company would confirm the terms or conditions of their agreement, but Coke will retain Burger King as a client, helping it maintain its dominance over PepsiCo and Cadbury Schweppes in sales to fast-food restaurants.
2003-07-18	Profits at Coke Climb 11% And Beat Analysts' Estimate	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter profits increased 11 percent, largely on the strength of strong sales of its noncarbonated drinks like bottled water and Powerade. The weak dollar and a lower tax rate also helped to lift profits, the company said.
2003-07-18	Coke to Seek Ideas For Sprite's Ads	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had asked agencies to present creative ideas for advertising its Sprite brand, which has been handled since 2001 by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York. Billings on the account were estimated at $45 million. Dan Schafer, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the move in Adweek.com. ''As we are working on new creative ideas for the Sprite brand,'' he said, ''we have invited several agencies to participate in the process. What happens after that, I'm not going to speculate on.''
2003-07-17	QUARTERLY EARNINGS RISE FOR COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES	Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest soft-drink bottler, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings increased 21 percent. Shares in the company, however, had their biggest decline in 18 months because higher prices and cool weather hurt sales in North America. The number of products sold was unchanged in the United States and Canada, which account for three-quarters of its sales, said the company, which is based in Atlanta. Analysts had forecast a gain of about 2 percent. Coca-Cola Enterprises lowered its forecast for sales volume growth to 1 percent this year from 3 percent in January. Some consumers have switched to cheaper PepsiCo soft drinks after Coca-Cola Enterprises raised prices by 2.5 percent amid a weak economy and wet, cool weather that has hurt demand in the Northeast. Net income rose to $260 million, or 56 cents a share, after the payment of preferred dividends, from $215 million, or 47 cents, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 9 percent, to $4.6 billion. Shares fell $1.60, to $18.
2003-07-17	Editors' Note	An article in Business Day on Saturday reported the Coca-Cola Company's disclosure of an investigation by the United States attorney's office in Atlanta. The inquiry came after the filing of a lawsuit against the company by a former Coke executive, Matthew Whitley, who contends that Coke's fountain division engaged in a $2 billion accounting fraud, created slush funds and manipulated its inventories. The article went on to report that lawyers not connected with the investigation said it was possible that the Justice Department might be investigating Mr. Whitley. In fairness The Times should have sought comment on that possibility from Mr. Whitley or his lawyer. And in the absence of confirmation, the anonymous speculation should not have appeared. Yesterday his lawyer said Mr. Whitley is not the subject of any federal investigation and is cooperating with the Justice Department. The article also misspelled the surname of the lawyer. He is Marc Garber, not Graber.
2003-06-30	Coca-Cola tries selling sexiness in promoting Dasani in the competitive bottled-water market.	DECADES after 7Up was sold as ''wet and wild,'' a brand of bottled water is being pitched in much the same suggestive way, bringing soft-drink marketing tactics to an increasingly competitive fray. The bottled water, Dasani, is the subject of a significantly revamped campaign from Berlin Cameron/Red Cell in New York that begins today. Drenched with sexual imagery, the television commercials, print advertisements and posters, with a budget estimated at $20 million, are uncharacteristic for the Dasani parent, the Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola generally favors a wholesome approach to peddle its beverage brands.
2003-06-29	Affirmative Action: A Corporate Diary; Thankful for the Opportunity	Carl H. Ware, who until his retirement in February was the highest-ranking African-American executive at Coca-Cola, is a contemporary of Justice Thomas. Both men are about the same age, are native Georgians and are the descendants of sharecroppers. But the similarities, especially on the issue of affirmative action, end there. ''Where would this country be from a competitive standpoint if we did not embrace diversity through some mechanism?'' asked Mr. Ware, who is based in Atlanta. ''You can call it affirmative action. I call it opportunity being ensured through legal and legislative mechanisms.''
2003-06-18	Coke Confirms Product Test Was Rigged	Coca-Cola acknowledged yesterday that employees manipulated the results of a market test of Frozen Coke at Burger King restaurants, confirming one of the accusations raised by a former executive who has sued the company. Burger King, a major Coke customer, said it was disappointed by Coke's conduct and was conducting its own review. Coke, meanwhile, disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had issued an informal request for documents regarding the executive's assertions.
2003-06-04	COCA-COLA APPOINTS CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had named Daniel P. Palumbo chief marketing officer. Mr. Palumbo, 45, worked most recently as the senior vice president of the Eastman Kodak Company and president of its consumer imaging division. Mr. Palumbo will supervise Coke's marketing efforts around the world, the company said. He will report to Steven J. Heyer, Coke's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Palumbo will succeed Stephen C. Jones, who resigned in March to pursue other interests. Sherri Day (NYT)
2003-05-10	Summer May Bring a Bottled Water Price War	The bottled water industry is on the verge of a price war that could drive down the substantial profit margins enjoyed by bottlers like Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestlé and, according to some analysts, drive smaller competitors out of business. Earlier this year, the Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers lowered the prices of Dannon water by 25 percent at grocery stores and mass retailers like Wal-Mart. In those stores, the company soon edged ahead of its chief rivals: Nestlé, the industry leader, with 38 percent of the domestic bottled water business, and PepsiCo, which makes Aquafina, the leading brand of water.
2003-04-18	Coca-Cola is taking lines from a classic in its campaign to stimulate a thirst for Diet Coke.	TWO decades ago, the Pepsi-Cola Company peddled Diet Pepsi with a campaign that carried the theme ''Now you see it, now you don't.'' These days, those words could be used to describe the status of advertising for a competitive brand, Diet Coke, which has appeared, disappeared and reappeared with bewildering irregularity as the account changed agencies three times in five years. As the Coca-Cola Company struggles to regain momentum in its home North American market, where sales volume growth in the first quarter fell below estimates, advertising for Diet Coke resumes today with an energetic, playfully sexy campaign that seeks to associate the brand with youthful joie de vivre.
2003-04-17	Coca-Cola Reports a Profit, But Fails to Sway Investors	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that strong sales of Vanilla Coke and Diet Coke in the first quarter allowed it to reverse course and report earnings despite economic challenges in some places overseas. But a modest growth of 4 percent in worldwide volume disappointed investors, who had been expecting a larger gain. Net income in the quarter rose to $835 million, or 34 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $194 million, or 8 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results included a charge of 3 cents a share related to streamlining initiatives and a penny gain from settlement of litigation. Excluding the one-time items, the results were in line with analysts' expectations, according to Thomson First Call.
2003-04-08	Coca-Cola to Expand College Sports Ties	In an effort to expand its marketing presence in college sports programming, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had tentatively agreed to invest in and form a marketing partnership with College Sports Television in New York, a new cable network. The agreement includes a $10 million ownership stake in the company for Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, and a $5 million marketing package that could include activities like advertising, special events and other entertainment. Coca-Cola will also sponsor the network's Sunday night lineup of Notre Dame sports programming, scheduled for the fall.
2003-04-01	War Protests In India Aim At Bottlers	To protest the American-led invasion of Iraq, radical groups in India have taken to staging armed raids on some of the most visible symbols of America in this soft-drink-loving country: Coke and Pepsi warehouses. In the latest raid, 10 members of the People's War Group, an outlawed militant Maoist faction that has clashed with local authorities in southern India for two decades, stormed a Pepsi-Cola warehouse in the Guntur district of Andhar Pradesh late Sunday night.
2003-03-14	COCA-COLA'S CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER RESIGNS	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday said that Stephen C. Jones, the chief marketing officer, had resigned. Mr. Jones, who has worked at Coke since 1986, had been expected to leave his post as Steven J. Heyer, Coke's new president and chief operating officer, overhauled the management team. Mr. Heyer is currently searching for Mr. Jones's replacement, the company wrote in a letter to its employees. Coca-Cola officials also announced the creation of a new senior management position yesterday. Danny Strickland, who had worked as senior vice president for innovation, technology and quality at General Mills, will become Coke's chief innovation and research and development officer on April 1, the company said, responsible for helping to develop new products, technologies and packages. Sherri Day (NYT)
2003-02-26	2 SODA GIANTS TO OFFER NEW FLAVORS OF EXISTING BRANDS	Pepsi-Cola North America and the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that they would introduce extensions of their soft drink brands. Pepsi said it had revamped Mountain Dew for a 12-week promotion running from Memorial Day to Labor Day to add an orange flavor to Mountain Dew, to be called Mountain Dew LiveWire. Coke's new entry will be called Sprite Remix. The drink, expected to be in stores by late spring, will have a tropical taste, the company said. Sherri Day (NYT)
2003-02-24	To Cash This Paycheck, Find the Nearest A.T.M.	More than half of American workers have given up paychecks for the convenience of direct deposits. But for an estimated 25 million employees without bank accounts, payday usually still means visits to payroll then hefty fees at check-cashing windows. To reach those workers, some companies on payday transfer wages to plastic cards that work like debit cards. Employees, who typically pay a monthly fee if they make more than one withdrawal, use them to obtain money from automated teller machines and, in many cases, shop wherever Visa or MasterCard is accepted.
2003-02-21	COCA-COLA NOMINATES MORGAN EXECUTIVE TO ITS BOARD	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had nominated Maria Elena Lagomasino, the chairwoman and chief executive of the J. P. Morgan Private Bank, to its board. If elected, Ms. Lagomasino will replace Paul F. Oreffice, the former chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, who is retiring. In September, Coke was criticized by an independent diversity task force for failing to choose minority candidates when it nominated two people to its board last spring. Ms. Lagomasino, who is a native of Cuba and has spent most of her career in private banking, serves on the board of Avon Products. Coke said in a separate announcement that it had raised its quarterly dividend to 22 cents a share, from 20 cents. Sherri Day (NYT)
2003-02-13	Strong Water and Juice Sales Increase Coke Profits by 1.8%	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 1.8 percent and its volume growth outpaced its competitors in every major category last year. Coke attributed most of its gains to strong sales of noncarbonated drinks, acquisitions and licensing agreements for bottled water. Analysts called attention to a 3 percent increase in North American sales of Coke Classic, and said it was proof that the company could reinvigorate slumping cola sales. Over all, the company recorded a 2 percent increase in worldwide volume of carbonated soft drinks.
2003-02-07	Coca-Cola Shifts Duties for Classic	In a setback for McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York and its parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies, the Coca-Cola Company has formally awarded creative duties in North America for its flagship soft drink brand, Coca-Cola Classic, to Berlin Cameron/Red Cell in New York. The shift, announced yesterday, came a month after Coca-Cola introduced a campaign for the brand, carrying the theme ''Coca-Cola . . . Real,'' that was produced by Berlin Cameron, part of the Red Cell division of the WPP Group, rather than by McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of Interpublic. Coca-Cola is to spend about $250 million this year on ''Real'' ads in North America.
2003-01-31	New Beverage From Snapple Seeks to Avoid Stigma of Dieting	Trying to take some of the public embarrassment out of dieting, Snapple yesterday announced a new meal-replacement product that it hopes looks less like a weight-loss aid and more like, well, a Snapple. Snapple-a-Day, a fortified juice smoothie that will be on store shelves next month, is the beverage company's entry into the $1-billion-a-year meal-replacement business, which is dominated by Slim-Fast from Unilever and includes products like Ensure and protein-laden powder drinks associated with the Atkins diet. Snapple-a-Day has 210 calories -- 10 fewer than Slim Fast -- as well as vitamins and minerals including calcium, zinc, potassium and folic acid.
2003-01-31	COCA-COLA TO LAY OFF 1,000 EMPLOYEES IN NORTH AMERICA	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would lay off 1,000 employees in North America. The layoffs, which are a part of the company's plan to realign its business in North America by combining its soda, fountain drink, Minute Maid and water divisions, are expected to be completed by the end of March, Douglas N. Daft, Coke's chairman and chief executive, said in a memo to employees. Five hundred of the job cuts will be made in Atlanta, the company said. Mr. Daft also said the company would simplify its supply chain and combine its information technology, human resources, sales and finance staffs. Coke's last major round of layoffs was in January 2000, when it eliminated 5,000 jobs. The company employs 12,000 workers in the United States and 30,000 people worldwide. Sherri Day (NYT)
2003-01-22	Some sponsors are backing off to fine-tune the art of blending their products into television shows.	AS ''American Idol'' returned to Fox last night for a second season, the products of five sponsors are playing prominent roles during the episodes themselves. But only three of the five -- AT&T Wireless, Coca-Cola and Ford Motor -- will have placements so pervasive that viewers must shut their eyes, or change the channel, to avoid them. And while the ubiquitous Coca-Cola red sofa, bearing the Coke logo, will be back for a second run, the intensity of the show's product placements will be dialed down compared with last season. Fox's midcourse correction on ''American Idol'' is indicative of the adjustments being made by television networks, advertisers and agencies as they proceed with aggressive plans to embed products in episodes of entertainment shows. Madison Avenue is increasingly anxious about the growing ability of viewers to zip, zap, mute or otherwise ignore traditional commercials with personal video recorders like TiVo or with remote controls.
2003-01-18	Venezuelan Soldiers Try to Reopen Beverage Plants	Venezuela's national guard today seized warehouses full of beer, soft drinks and bottled water, which had been closed since the start of a seven-week strike that has crippled business and industry and caused food shortages. The seizures were considered a crackdown against opponents of President Hugo Chávez, who have led the strike to demand new elections.
2003-01-15	COCA-COLA TO COMBINE MINUTE MAID AND COKE DIVISIONS	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would combine its Minute Maid North America business with its North American unit. Don Knauss, the president of Minute Maid North America, was appointed to lead the merger of the two divisions. The new unit will report to Jeffrey T. Dunn, the president of Coca-Cola North America. The company also appointed Sandy Douglas, who is the president of Coke's North American division, to the new post of chief customer officer. Mr. Douglas will report to Steven J. Heyer, Coke's president and chief operating officer, and will be responsible for working with other Coke units to revamp the company's customer service strategy. Sherri Day (NYT)
2003-01-14	Corporate Donation Buoys Home For Jazz	Against a backdrop of generally shrinking donations to arts groups, the Coca-Cola Company has agreed to give $10 million toward completion of Jazz at Lincoln Center's new home on Columbus Circle. The gift is crucial to the $128 million project, which will be a centerpiece of the new AOL Time Warner headquarters building, because the project is facing higher construction costs and the withdrawal of several pledges that were made in flusher economic times. In return for the $10 million commitment, which leaves the project $32 million short of its goal, Jazz at Lincoln Center will name one of its three performance venues, a 140-seat club-like space, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola.
2014-01-02	Coca-Cola goes back to its 'Real' past in an effort to find some new fizz for its Classic brand.	WITH a nod to ad campaigns of the past and soda guzzlers of the future, the Coca-Cola Company yesterday announced the biggest overhaul of its marketing and advertising in a decade for its lagging flagship brand, Coca-Cola Classic. The theme of the new campaign -- ''Coca-Cola . . . Real'' -- plays off slogans that have come and gone over the last 60 years, like ''It's the real thing'' and ''Can't beat the real thing.'' Executives at Coca-Cola and its ad agencies, McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York and Berlin Cameron/Red Cell, said the campaign aims to link the brand with the notion of authenticity and genuine moments in people's lives.
2002-12-31	They Choke On Coke, But Savor Mecca-Cola	The idea, says Tawfik Mathlouthi, who runs a radio station for France's Muslim minority, came to him in the shower: to create a competing product to Coke that would satisfy the needs of Arab speakers in Europe and elsewhere for soft drinks, while providing jobs and economic growth. ''My son adores McDonald's and Coke,'' Mr. Mathlouthi, 46, the father of two young boys, acknowledged in an interview. His 10-year-old was chagrined when his father urged him not to patronize American brands. ''He said to me, 'Papa, I agree not to drink Coke, but you have to give me something.' That's how the idea was born.''
2002-12-27	APPEALS COURT DENIES PEPSI'S SUIT AGAINST COCA-COLA	PepsiCo lost a bid yesterday to revive a lawsuit that accused its rival, the Coca-Cola Company, of violating antitrust laws by forcing distributors to sell Coca-Cola's drinks to retailers. A two-judge appeals panel affirmed a September 2000 ruling by Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan that dismissed the suit brought by Pepsi, which asserted that Coca-Cola committed antitrust violations by barring its independent distributors, which supply restaurants, movie theater chains and other food-service outlets, from selling Pepsi. A spokesman for Pepsi, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., said the company planned no further appeals.
2002-12-23	Diet Coke Account Goes to Foote, Cone	The Coca-Cola Company named Foote, Cone & Belding in New York, part of the FCB Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle creative duties for the Diet Coke account, with spending estimated at $10 million. Those duties had been handled by Lowe & Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Partnership division of Interpublic. Susan McDermott, a spokeswoman for Coke in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the decision in the online editions of Adweek and Advertising Age, declining to comment further.
2002-12-14	Coke to End Forecasting Of Earnings	The Coca-Cola Company said today that it would stop making earnings forecasts after this quarter, following the lead of a large shareholder, Warren E. Buffett. Focusing on profit goals is a distraction from longer-term objectives that enhance growth, the company said.
2002-12-12	Coke Names a Former Outsider President	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had named Steven J. Heyer, who joined the company in 2001, president and chief operating officer. The positions had been empty since May 2001, when Coke's former president abruptly resigned. The selection ends, at least temporarily, more than a year of speculation about the future of Mr. Heyer.
2002-11-10	A Soda Company Struggles to Whet A Town's Interest	HOSMER MOUNTAIN soda, with its 30 flavors, is popular among many residents and workers in Willimantic. The superintendent of schools is partial to the root beer. The deputy fire chief likes the diet cola. First Selectman Michael Paulhus said his favorite is strawberry. As for the rest of the Paulhus family, almost any flavor will do. The family has been drinking the soda for three generations.
2002-10-28	Coke Sign Goes Dark in Times Square	After 11 years of teasing parched New Yorkers, the animated Coca-Cola sign in Times Square is dark. Workers began removing thousands of light bulbs and other small parts of the sign last week, and today they will start to dismantle the large sections. The company is closely guarding designs for a more advanced sign, which will be built there in 2003. Coca-Cola's action comes as Hershey Foods turns on a 15-story animated display today at the site of its new store at Broadway and 48th Street. The display has machines that release steam and versions of its candies bigger than the biggest eyes could dream of; the effect is a bit like a partly edible Pompidou Center. ''Coca-Cola is a fixture in Times Square, but the challenge is not to be overshadowed by them,'' said Wynn Willard, Hershey's chief marketing officer. The company's sign was created by Clear Channel Spectacolor.
2002-10-17	Coke's Glum Forecast Sends Stock Down 10%	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings increased 8 percent. But its stock fell more than 10 percent, the steepest one-day decline in four years, after Coke said it would not meet earnings projections for the year because of weakness in Latin America and difficult weather conditions in some other foreign markets. Analysts said that the company, in lowering its forecast yesterday, showed how closely its sales were tied to the global economy. Coke earns 76 percent of its profit from sales outside the United States.
2002-10-08	Coca-Cola to Start Harry Potter Promotion	The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta will begin the second round of an advertising and promotional campaign tied to the Harry Potter films being released by Warner Brothers. A promotion centered on the second film in the series, ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' will start Monday, almost a month before the film is scheduled to open on Nov. 15. As part of the promotion, Coca-Cola Classic products will have codes that can be used for access to a Web site (www.livethemagic.com) to see scenes from the movie.
2002-09-29	McCall Defends Letters to Two Companies	With five weeks left until Election Day, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall yesterday dismissed mounting accusations that he used his influence as the steward of New York State's $105 billion pension fund to help relatives in their job searches. ''I pass along résumés of qualified people all the time,'' Mr. McCall said after a speech on educational policies at Columbia University.
2002-09-26	Anti-Bias Task Force Gives Coca-Cola Good Marks, but Says Challenges Remain	The Coca-Cola Company received passing grades yesterday for its recent treatment of women and minority employees from an independent diversity task force. According to the task force's report, the company has made ''real progress'' toward achieving the goals that were set forth in the settlement agreement of the 1999 racial bias lawsuit against Coke. But the report also said ''significant challenges remain.'' A survey of employees revealed negative attitudes persisted among minorities and women about fairness and commitment to diversity within Coke. Black employees consistently rated the company lower than did whites and other minorities on questions related to the fairness of career advancement, pay decisions and Coke's commitment to equal opportunity.
2002-09-10	A Founder Quits Firm To Work for Coca-Cola	Esther Lee, a longtime New York agency executive, is joining the Coca-Cola Company in the new post of chief creative officer for North America. A spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta confirmed a report about Ms. Lee's hiring this week in Advertising Age. She will oversee the company's advertising, he said, and report to Chris Lowe, chief marketing officer for North America.
2002-08-31	In Fight Over Women, Masters Gives Up Ads	Rejecting demands that it quickly add women as members, Augusta National Golf Club said yesterday that it would do without commercial sponsors for the 2003 Masters telecast because the sponsors could come under pressure from women's groups. The club said that it had stripped its tournament of advertising from its three sponsors -- Citigroup, I.B.M. and Coca-Cola -- to protect them from a campaign begun in June by the National Council of Women's Organizations.
2002-08-28	Many Marketers Will Forgo Ads During Sept. 11	Two weeks before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a consensus seems to be emerging about advertising on that day: less will be more. Most marketers, agencies and media companies are deciding that they would rather go adless or limit their advertising than risk being perceived as exploiting the day for mercenary purposes.
2002-08-20	Coke's India Operation to Sell 49% Stake	With a government-imposed deadline about to expire, the Indian unit of Coca-Cola said on Friday that it would sell 49 percent of its wholly owned bottling subsidiary to Indian institutions and investors and to its employees. ''Hindustan Coca-Cola Holdings has decided to partly Indianize its downstream beverage business,'' the company said in a statement.
2002-08-17	Coke Classic Is Set to Get A New Look	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would give the packaging of its flagship Coke Classic brand a makeover early next year. The design, which will appear on all Coke Classic cans, bottles and cardboard packaging, will return to the ribbon the company first used in 1969. The ribbon, which has been redesigned to include condensation bubbles that float around text on Coke's traditional red background, looks like a cross between a multilayered swirl and an infinity symbol. Most of the layers of the ribbon are white, but the pattern will also include a thread of yellow.
2002-08-16	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Soda Ads Deface Mountain	The cutthroat competition between local arms of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo landed them both in trouble with the Indian government after they covered a mountainside in the Himalayas with competing soft drink ads. The huge ads painted on the rock cliffs can be seen from a busy road in Himachal Pradesh Province, about 200 miles north of New Delhi. India's solicitor general, Harish Salve, said cleaning away the signs with chemicals might compound the environmental damage done by painting them. He has begun court proceedings against the companies and called for an investigation by a government research institute. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2002-08-01	THE MARKETS: Market Place; G.E. Joining Move Toward New Way To Count Options	General Electric, the nation's biggest company by stock market value, yesterday joined a small but growing group of companies that are changing how they account for stock options. G.E. went even further by saying that top executives would no longer be allowed to take profits immediately after cashing in options. Responding to criticism that options-heavy pay packages have given executives enormous incentives to create short-term profits, G.E. said it would require its top officers to hold, for at least a year, some of the shares they get after exercising options. It also said those officers would have to hold substantial stock positions as long as they work at the company.
2002-07-30	Sprite tries to increase sales with a campaign about thirsts.	IN an attempt to re-engage young consumers, Sprite, the lemon-lime soft drink sold by the Coca-Cola Company, is taking another new turn in a campaign that emphasizes individual passions -- or thirsts -- through the stories of real young people. The campaign, which began last night, is tied to several promotions and is the latest attempt by Sprite to turnaround sales and market share that declined in 2001 for the second consecutive year. Sprite spent more than $75 million on advertising last year, according to CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
2002-07-19	When a Crop Becomes King	Here in southern New England the corn is already waist high and growing so avidly you can almost hear the creak of stalk and leaf as the plants stretch toward the sun. The ears of sweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands, inaugurating one of the ceremonies of an American summer. These days the nation's nearly 80 million-acre field of corn rolls across the countryside like a second great lawn, but this wholesome, all-American image obscures a decidedly more dubious reality. Like the tulip, the apple and the potato, zea mays (the botanical name for both sweet and feed corn) has evolved with humans over the past 10,000 years in the great dance of species we call domestication. The plant gratifies human needs, in exchange for which humans expand the plant's habitat, moving its genes all over the world and remaking the land (clearing trees, plowing the ground, protecting it from its enemies) so it might thrive.
2002-07-18	Coke Says Profit Rose 15% Despite Weak Markets Abroad	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings increased 15 percent despite weak economic conditions in several of its international markets. It attributed the increase primarily to product innovation and strong sales in North America and Asia. The company also said that it was comfortable with analysts' estimates for 2002 earnings and that it would stand by its projections for volume growth, or the amount of beverage shipped. Analysts expect the company to earn $1.75 to $1.80 a share for the full year, according to Thomson First Call.
2002-07-18	Sponsors Sidestep Debate	Two of the three companies that advertise on CBS's broadcasts of the Masters are distancing themselves from a campaign to open the Augusta National Golf Club's membership to women before next April's tournament by saying they do not sponsor the club. The three sponsors, Coca-Cola, I.B.M. and Citigroup, are limited to four minutes of advertising an hour during the Masters so that a maximum amount of golf can be shown.
2002-07-16	It's the Real Thing	With President Bush digging in his heels in defense of accounting tricks that hide the true cost of stock options, and Congress equivocating under intense corporate lobbying, reform has come from an unexpected place -- the Coca-Cola Company. Coke announced this week that it would start counting against its yearly earnings the options it grants employees. It is a bold commitment to reform, and one that, particularly given the meltdown in the stock market in recent days, the White House and Congress should take to heart. Options, the right to buy stock in the company at a given and generally favorable price, were a fast-growing part of employee compensation packages in the 1990's. They can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the case of top executives, but unlike salaries and bonuses, they almost never show up as expenses on corporate balance sheets. That works out nicely for the corporations, which can report better earnings as a result.
2002-07-15	Coke to Report Stock Options As an Expense	The Coca-Cola Company, breaking ranks with the vast majority of American companies, said yesterday that it would change its accounting so that its earnings reflect the value of the stock options it grants to executives and other employees. That move, which will lower Coke's reported profits, is permitted but not required by accounting rules, largely because of intense lobbying by corporations when the rules were adopted in 1994.
2002-07-10	World Business Briefing | Europe: Switzerland: Coke Acquisition	The Coca-Cola Company expanded its reach into Europe by buying Valser, a well-known Swiss bottled water company. The Hess Group sold its 50 percent stake to Coca-Cola; no price was disclosed. Valser was founded in 1961, and sold 122.5 million liters of mineral water last year. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, is expected to retain Valser's 96 employees. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
2002-07-09	Messages on a Bottle	To the Editor: ''Statisticians Count Euros and Find More Than Money'' (July 2) took me back to my youth in Camden, N.J., when I was unknowingly involved in a precursor study of the same phenomenon.
2002-07-07	Just Don't Toss Your Bottle Of Coca-Cola in the Ocean	Speaking of the Jersey Shore, Ol' Barney, the Barnegat Lighthouse, has been an enduring symbol of the 127-mile-long stretch of beach for about 150 years, but this year it is lending its charms to Coca-Cola for the cause of better beaches. Coke has emblazoned special eight-ounce bottles with Ol' Barney's likeness in an agreement with an environmental organization, the Jersey Shore Partnership.
2002-07-05	An old brand is back in America with ads for a young crowd.	BRITNEY SPEARS may not have much to worry about, but the Fantanas are coming to town. Unlike Ms. Spears -- who not only plugs Pepsi products but has a recording career and millions of fans, the four-girl group, the Fantanas, does not actually sing. But that is not stopping the Coca-Cola Company from trying to build the faux singers into a marketing tool aimed at competing with its rival for the money and tastes of American teenagers.
2002-06-12	CBS and N.C.A.A. In Deal With Coke	The CBS division of Viacom and the National Collegiate Athletic Association said yesterday that they had signed an 11-year agreement with the Coca-Cola Company valued at more than $500 million. The deal awards Coca-Cola the marketing and media rights to 87 championship tournaments overseen by the N.C.A.A., including the annual basketball tournament on CBS. Coca-Cola becomes the association's first ''corporate champion,'' and the deal covers advertising, marketing and promotions for men's and women's sports. The marketing rights will be administered by Host Communications, a division of the Bull Run Corporation that already works with CBS.
2002-06-02	Swinging Down to Florida	Two youngsters from the Newark area will have an opportunity to play golf with Tiger Woods later this month, and 13 others will play with other pros during the Coca-Cola/Tiger Woods Foundation Junior Golf Clinic June 17 through 19 at Walt Disney's World Resort in Orlando, Fla. The Newark Renaissance Junior Golf program, which includes inner city and minority girls and boys ranging in age from 10 to 17 from Newark and the surrounding area, was one of five junior golf programs selected by the Tiger Woods Foundation to participate in the foundation's 25th youth golf clinic. (Shown is Tom Kite with Anthony Middleton of Newark in 1998.) The other golf programs, are from Buffalo, Philadelphia, Fort Worth and Orlando. The trip covers all expenses, including admission to the Disney park for 15 youngsters from each program and a parent or guardian of each. The foundation was created in 1996 to help inner city youth. Karen DeMasters
2002-06-01	Procter Is Suing Coca-Cola On Calcium Drinks Patent	Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant, filed a lawsuit yesterday against the Coca-Cola Company, asserting that Coke's Minute Maid division had violated Procter's patent for adding calcium to fruit drinks. The lawsuit, which was filed in Federal District Court in Cincinnati, where Procter is based, accuses Minute Maid of using Procter's calcium technology in making its Premium Calcium Rich Home Squeezed Style Orange Juice and its Premium Calcium Original Orange Juice.
2002-05-19	Workers Contend Coke Sent Old Soda to Poor Neighborhoods	From the shade of a loading dock, watching the big rigs shed payloads of leftover Coca-Cola for supermarkets in the black neighborhoods of Dallas, William D. Wright says he learned how to keep quiet and do as he was told. For years, he says, he stripped expired soda cans from their cardboard sheaths, stuffed them into fresh boxes with new dates stamped on the side, then piled them on store shelves as if they were new.
2002-05-19	PrivateSector; Adding a Talk-Show Spritz To Coke's Annual Mixer	Among the annual shareholder meetings this season, the Coca-Cola Company's fiesta in New York last month stands out. Many companies chose to be circumspect about their get-togethers, citing cost and security concerns this year, said Patrick McGurn, vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services, which tracks the meetings. But Coke executives brought in Jon Bon Jovi, Wynton Marsalis, Cal Ripken Jr., Muhammad Ali and other celebrities to help tout the virtues of owning shares in Coca-Cola. Playing an active role at the meeting, which cost the company about $5.5 million, according to Beverage Digest, was the television journalist Charlie Rose. He performed as both master of ceremonies onstage and as the ''interviewer'' in a series of videotaped discussions about the company with Coke's chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft. Coke is the lead sponsor of Mr. Rose's show on PBS.
2002-05-01	COCA-COLA NAMES HEAD OF LATIN AMERICAN DIVISION	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that Steven J. Heyer, the president of its new-ventures division, would assume oversight of one of the company's most embattled economic markets: Latin America. While business in many other areas surged in the most recent quarter, Coke's sales in Latin America were listless, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. But perhaps more important, the management shift has intensified longstanding speculation that Mr. Heyer, 49, a rare company outsider who arrived last year from Turner Broadcasting, is being groomed as the successor to Douglas N. Daft, the chief executive. Greg Winter (NYT)
2002-04-18	Teamsters Union Protests at Coke Meeting	Accusing the Coca-Cola Company of ''closing its eyes'' to the intimidation, torture and assassination of union workers who bottle its drinks, the Teamsters union demanded yesterday that the company adopt and enforce strict labor standards for the manufacture of its products around the world. Standing beside a car-sized inflatable rat draped with the Coca-Cola logo in Manhattan, James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, accused the company of standing by and abdicating responsibility for the murder of eight union leaders who organized workers at Coke bottling plants in Colombia over the last decade, a charge the company vehemently denies.
2002-04-17	Though Coke Reports Loss, Some Foresee Better Days	Despite a long-awaited resurgence in soda sales, Coca-Cola announced a $125 million loss for the first quarter yesterday, primarily because of required mandatory changes in its accounting methods and the dwindling value of its plants in ailing economies of Latin America. Although revenue rose 3 percent for the quarter, to $4.08 billion from $3.96 billion in the period a year earlier, net income dropped by almost $1 billion. The bulk of that decrease stemmed from a required overhaul in the way companies account for their acquisitions -- a shift that, almost alone, produced a loss of 5 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of 38 cents a share a year earlier.
2002-04-17	A Campus Breakfast	To the Editor: Years ago, while attending Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, I frequently joined classmates for breakfast before trudging across campus for an early class. While they sat sipping coffee over their eggs, I slipped unnoticed to the soda fountain, where I would fill my coffee cup with Coca-Cola and join them, undetected, in enjoying my morning beverage. RICHARD A. OVERHOLT New York
2002-04-17	Coke, Not Coffee	To the Editor: For years, I thought I was one of the few oddballs who drank Coke with breakfast. A cold Coke is the perfect wake-up jolt to get me going in the morning.
2002-04-17	Cherished Ritual	To the Editor: I, too, am a Coke aficionado, although not from the South, unless you consider from the South Shore of Long Island. I, too, have my ritual for how to pour my Coke. Take a large glass, and fill to the brim with ice cubes. Rinse quickly with cold water. (This allows the fizz to remain bold.) Slowly pour the Coke into the glass (much like pouring a beer) and add a wedge of fresh lemon. Nothing can beat that buzz.
2002-04-11	COCA-COLA EXPANDS BEVERAGE PACT WITH DELTA AIR LINES	The Coca-Cola Company expanded its beverage agreement with Delta Air Lines Inc. to include five international carriers affiliated with Delta. Terms were not disclosed. The Delta SkyTeam partners Alitalia of Italy, the Korean Air Company, Aeroméxico, CSA Czech Airlines and Air France agreed to stop serving PepsiCo Inc.'s drinks as part of the five-year contract. A Coca-Cola spokesman, Kelly Brooks, said the company extended its 70-year relationship with Delta by 8 years.
2002-04-10	Coke: It's What's for Breakfast (And Not Just Down South)	I WAS meeting a big-time Hollywood producer for a screenplay-pitch power breakfast at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, where most of the menu reads as if it were written by the chief of the cardiac care unit at Cedars Sinai and the wafer-thin waiters look like Prada models. The big-time producer was talking on a cellphone so small he had to hold it between his thumb and forefinger. He was power-whispering deal points into the phone so that the larger numbers could be overheard by the bevy of movie executives at the next table, when one of the wisp-o-waiters glided up and intoned, ''Coffee, sir?'' Imagine the dilemma. Coffee at the Peninsula is a lot better than most of the over-priced warmed-over brown water you get around town, but I didn't want coffee. What I really wanted was a Coke, and I knew that in Los Angeles, as in much of the nation, I was staring straight into a massive, gaping maw of prejudice when it came to having a Coke with breakfast. Susan Moore, resident food nut and an owner of the mega-hip Hollywood Hills Restaurant, summed up the local attitude this way: ''Coke for breakfast? We may be loons in L. A., but we haven't gone that far.''
2002-04-07	Executive Pay: A Special Report; Coke Rewrote Rules, Aiding Its Boss	THE year 2001 was a bad one for the companies that make Coke, but not for many of the executives who run the business. The Coca-Cola Company and its bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, rewrote their pay rules once it became clear that they would not meet their goals. In doing so, the companies offered perhaps the starkest example of discarding the principle of pay for performance, consultants said.
2002-04-01	Coca-Cola Said to Be Preparing Vanilla Version of Its Soft Drink	Speculation is growing that Coca-Cola is preparing to introduce a vanilla-flavored version of Coca-Cola Classic, the world's best-selling soft drink. Coke has prepared samples of packaging for the new drink and is about 90 percent certain of proceeding with the product introduction, according to Beverage Digest, a trade publication that has been tracking speculation about the drink for several months.
2002-03-29	Sassy Ads Enliven Soda War In India	For weeks, Satvika Prabhu, 15, and her friends in the ninth grade have been agog. They cannot seem to stop talking about each new blow and counterblow in an all-out marketing war between Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, fought out on television with ads, counterads and counter-counterads as the weather starts to soar into summer heat. New salvos appear almost daily, leaving Satvika and millions of Indians like her, mainstays of the $1.2 billion soft drink market in India, engrossed and dying for more.
2002-03-19	World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Brewery Acquisition	Molson Inc. of Canada and Heineken, based in the Netherlands, have joined forces to form Brazil's second-biggest brewer through the merger of the Kaiser Group, in which Heineken has a 14 percent stake, and the smaller Bavaria Group, controlled by Molson. Molson has agreed to pay $765 million in stock and cash for Kaiser. Heineken will have a 20 percent stake in the new company for an investment of $220 million. Coca-Cola and its Brazilian bottler presently own 85.8 percent of Kaiser. They will be paid in stock and will have a representative on Molson's board. Molson presently distributes Heineken products in Canada. Bernard Simon (NYT)
2002-03-10	I'd Like To Buy The World a Shelf-Stable Children's Lactic Drink	Kazuki Yamane, Makoto Sato and I hop out of our chauffeured car at the corner of a busy Tokyo intersection. The two men are wearing suits, and I follow them into the bustle, distracted by teeming madness all around me. Some sort of shrieking dance squad is handing out free cosmetics samples. Multiple massive TV screens beam loops of commercials down to the street. The pedestrian flow is a blocks-thick surge of teenagers tapping at their cellphones. This neighborhood, Shibuya, is the frenzied, wired heart of nearly all Japanese teenage culture. It is also an important consumer lab for the Coca-Cola Company. Yamane and Sato -- both middle-aged Coke execs -- have taken me here to view the newest Coke innovation. They're sure it's another triumph of Coca-Cola marketing genius, and angling fast through the crowds now, dicing up flocks of schoolgirls, I can tell this main attraction is drawing near. The excitement builds on Sato's face. Our steps begin to slow. And then, at last, beside the entrance to a busy shopping boutique, I come face to face with the gleaming future of soft drinks. The Coke execs are beaming now and wildly gesturing toward it. Before me is . . . a vending machine.
2002-03-10	Corrections	A picture caption on Jan. 27 with an article about the marketing of Olympic athletes misspelled the surname of an ice dancer and, because of an editing error, omitted her involvement in the situation. She is Naomi Lang, not Long, and her performances were sponsored by Coca-Cola. A reader alerted The Times to the misspelling on Feb. 1; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.
2002-03-10	Private Sector; A Soft-Drink Substitution, But No Hard Feelings	A funny thing happened at the United Negro College Fund awards dinner honoring those who have supported minority education. One of the two award recipients, Douglas N. Daft, chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, didn't show up. Citing a personal obligation, Mr. Daft sent Jeffrey Dunn, president and chief operating officer for the Americas, to accept the Frederick D. Patterson Award at the Sheraton New York Thursday night. Robert L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive of BET, the black entertainment company, was the other recipient.
2002-02-26	Some spots fell short, but other commercials during Olympics were worthy of the gold.	AS the sun slowly sets on the tantrums, Roots berets and disqualifications of the 19th Olympic Winter Games, we bid a fond farewell to the trillions of commercials that appeared on NBC, CNBC and MSNBC and collectively exclaim, ''Well, it could have been worse.'' Because the Olympic commercials began only five days after a Super Bowl that was replete with tacky, tasteless and hyperpatriotic spots, there had been little hope that Madison Avenue could avoid a second straight stumble. But many commercials shown during the 17 days of the Winter Games were surprisingly better than expected, certainly surpassing the botched batches that made viewers cringe during the last few Olympics.
2002-01-30	Coke Earnings Soar, Yet Its Stock Price Falls	Free from the burden of paying the largest racial discrimination settlement ever and the cost of revamping, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings nearly quadrupled. But the company also warned against expecting too much in a ''very challenging economic environment'' around the world, continuing its practice of gradually stepping down expectations, year after year.
2002-01-24	COCA-COLA BOTTLER REPORTS LOSS FOR QUARTER	Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler of Coca-Cola beverages, reported a fourth-quarter loss yesterday, saying it was a result of a change in how it accounts for payments from Coke and higher revamping costs. The change, which reduced 2001 earnings by $302 million, or 70 cents a share, will not affect profit this year, the chief executive, Lowry Kline, said. Coca-Cola owns about 40 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises. The bottler said it had a loss of $36 million, or 8 cents a share, in contrast to net income of $16 million, or 4 cents. Sales rose 11 percent, to $3.97 billion.
2001-12-16	Charity of Relative Newcomers Rivals Gifts to Atlanta From Old-Timers	For most of the last century, the color of corporate and philanthropic influence in Atlanta has been red, Coca-Cola red. But these days, two transplants from the Northeast, Bernard Marcus and Arthur M. Blank, founders of the Home Depot, are painting the town orange. Three weeks ago, Mr. Marcus, who grew up in a tenement in Newark, announced he would donate $200 million to build a world-class aquarium in Atlanta. Last week, Mr. Blank, who grew up in the New York borough of Queens, sealed a deal to buy the Atlanta Falcons football franchise for $545 million.
2001-12-10	Coca-Cola puts its marketing heritage into an online archive for those who seek to expand on it.	IN a marriage of Big Red and Big Blue, the extensive marketing records of the Coca-Cola Company -- from calendars created by Norman Rockwell to corporate memoranda to the famous commercial in which a chorus proclaims its desire to ''teach the world to sing'' -- have been digitized in an online archive with the help of I.B.M. The goal of the project, with an estimated cost of less than $5 million, is to make it easier for Coca-Cola employees, from the headquarters in Atlanta to local offices in more than 200 countries, to gain access to advertising and marketing material going all the way back to the first newspaper ad that appeared for the Coca-Cola soft-drink brand on May 29, 1886.
2001-12-05	COCA-COLA BOTTLER'S PROFIT TO BEAT FORECASTS	Profit next year at Coca-Cola Enterprises will rise more than forecast as the company, the largest bottler of the Coca-Cola Company's drinks, controls costs and increases prices and sales. Net income next year will be 80 cents to 85 cents a share, the company said. Analysts' average estimate is 75 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Coca-Cola Enterprises will raise prices 2 percent next year, the chief financial officer, Patrick Mannelly, said. The bottler, which is 38 percent owned by Coca-Cola, said it was negotiating a new multiyear contract with Coca-Cola that will end financing shortfalls.
2001-11-30	Nepal Coke Plant Bombed	Maoist rebels attacked a Coca-Cola factory today on the outskirts of Katmandu in their first assault on the capital since Nepal's government declared a state of emergency this week. The rebels planted two bombs at the site, causing some damage to the factory. No one was killed or wounded, officials said.
2001-11-28	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Coke Subsidiary To Diversify	The Indian subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Company is planning an expansion into the country's ready-to-drink coffee and tea market. ''Our mission is to lead the beverages revolution in India,'' said Irfan Khan, a spokesman for the subsidiary, Coca-Cola India. The beverages are currently being developed by Coke's Zurich-based joint venture with Nestlé. More than 70 percent of Indians drink tea and coffee as compared with the 2 percent who consume carbonated drinks. ''This is the segment we'd like to lead,'' Mr. Khan said. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2001-11-26	Miscellany	* Coca-Cola, Atlanta, is introducing a television commercial that for the first time presents an animated version of the company's familiar Santa Claus character created by the artist Hadden Sundblom. The commercial was created by McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. * Arnold Worldwide, Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising, is merging its media operations into the Media Planning Group, the media division of Havas. The Arnold unit of Media Planning will be renamed Arnold MPG. * Big Bang Communications, Lehigh Valley, Pa., is being renamed Origin Communications.
2001-11-22	Interpublic And PepsiCo Settling Suits	PepsiCo and the world's largest advertising agency company, the Interpublic Group of Companies, settled a legal battle yesterday stemming from PepsiCo's efforts to restrict an Interpublic agency in working for its main competitor, the Coca-Cola Company, after PepsiCo dismissed the agency. PepsiCo and Interpublic said they had agreed in principle to settle two lawsuits that PepsiCo had filed against Foote, Cone & Belding, an agency that is part of the FCB Group division of Interpublic, after PepsiCo dismissed Foote, Cone on Sept. 19.
2001-11-13	BOLDFACE NAMES	Coffee Shop Ovation It took less than 45 seconds to walk from Broadway to where the party for NEIL SIMON'S comedy ''45 Seconds From Broadway'' was in full swing. But the party was not at the venerable coffee shop in the Edison Hotel that is the backdrop for Mr. Simon's lightly fictionalized play. This party took the Broadway Danny Rose crowd to the far larger nightclub run by the World Wrestling Federation a few blocks away, on West 43rd Street. But what's a play about the coffee shop without a party at the coffee shop? So the coffee shop, known as the ''Polish Tea Room,'' had its party before the performance. HARRY and FRANCES EDELSTEIN, who have run the coffee shop for more than 30 years, were well fed (kasha varnishkes, blintzes and latkes) when they left for the Richard Rodgers Theater. After the curtain calls, and after being introduced to a standing ovation, they went to the nightclub for the second party. More lox, chopped liver, kasha varnishkes and, of course, memories.
2001-11-12	Coca-Cola keeps some brands where they are while PepsiCo battles a former agency in court.	IN another wild twist to the most recent skirmish in the cola wars, the Coca-Cola Company froze the planned shifts in the creative accounts of two of its large brands, the Powerade line of sports drinks and Dasani water. The changes are being undone, at least for now, because of a legal battle between the principal Coca-Cola competitor, PepsiCo, and the agency that was to gain the Dasani and Powerade assignments, the Foote, Cone & Belding unit of the FCB Group, which is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
2001-10-31	COCA-COLA WILL BUY ODWALLA, MAKER OF FRUIT DRINKS	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Odwalla Inc., a maker of fruit and vegetable drinks, for about $186 million in cash and assumed debt to gain a bigger share of the fast-growing market for noncarbonated beverages. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, agreed to pay $15.25 a share for Odwalla's common stock, a 29 percent premium over Monday's closing price of $11.83. Coca-Cola will assume about $5 million in debt, said a spokesman, Ben Deutsch. The acquisition is expected to add to earnings after a year, Coca-Cola said. Odwalla will become part of Coca-Cola's Minute Maid juice business. Coca-Cola has made several small acquisitions this year to increase sales of juice, water and noncarbonated beverages to combat sluggish demand for soft drinks. Odwalla is based in Half Moon Bay, Calif.
2001-10-30	Pepsi Files Suit To Stop Dasani Talks	PepsiCo has gone to court to prevent executives from a former agency, the Chicago office of Foote, Cone & Belding, from meeting with a new client, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo's competitor. A Cook County Circuit Court issued a restraining order last week against Foote, Cone, preventing its executives from meeting with Coca-Cola to discuss a new account, Dasani bottled water. Dasani was among $250 million in business shifted by Coca-Cola to Foote, Cone after the agency was dismissed by PepsiCo on $350 million worth of accounts that included a Dasani rival, Aquafina water. The PepsiCo suit contended that the agency was still a custodian of Aquafina trade secrets.
2001-10-26	INSIDE ART	After 70 Years, A Barefoot Boy Greets the Public A Norman Rockwell painting of a smiling boy about to take a swig of Coca-Cola is going on public view for the first time since it was painted, in 1931. ''The Barefoot Boy'' will be in ''Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American People,'' which opens at the Guggenheim Museum on Nov. 3.
2001-10-26	COCA-COLA JOINT VENTURE BUYS PHILIPPINE DRINK COMPANY	San Miguel, the Philippine food and beverage company, and its joint-venture partner Coca-Cola agreed yesterday to pay 14 billion pesos ($269 million) for the Philippines' second-largest soft drink company, Cosmos. The purchase, which defeated a bid by PepsiCo, will give the joint venture, Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, a 90 percent share of the Philippines' $1-billion-a-year soft drink market. The deal was approved when Cosmos's majority owner, the RMF Corporation, agreed to accept a lower offer after San Miguel discovered that some Cosmos equipment was below Coca-Cola's standards. Wayne Arnold (NYT)
2001-10-18	Earnings Down 80% at Big Coke Bottler	Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the largest bottler of the Coca-Cola Company's drinks, said today that its third-quarter profit fell 80 percent after the company raised prices less than it expected and costs rose from the purchase of Herb Coca-Cola. Net income fell to $26 million, or 6 cents a share, from $131 million, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Per-share figures are after the payment of preferred dividends. Sales rose nearly 11 percent, to $4.3 billion from $3.9 billion.
2001-10-17	Bowing to Nation's Mood, Retailer Cancels Issue of Racy Catalog	Abercrombie & Fitch, the apparel retailer known for campaigns that celebrate the pulchritude and pleasures of youth, will announce today that it has canceled the holiday issue of its quarterly publication because the content and tone were deemed inappropriate after the Sept. 11 attacks. The cancellation of the high-profile publication, known as the A & F Quarterly, is thought to be the first instance since the attacks in which an advertiser has scrapped a big planned marketing effort poised to be printed. But other companies have also been forced to alter campaigns and promotions as they struggle to strike the right balance for advertising in the last five weeks.
2001-10-15	Coca-Cola reassigns advertising for its drinks in one of Madison Avenue's biggest account shifts.	THE long wait for the Coca-Cola Company to make final arrangements for one of the largest account shifts in the history of Madison Avenue is over. Almost.
2001-10-01	The industry sees changes in big accounts, but also layoffs and profit warnings.	AS Madison Avenue slowly seeks a return to business as usual -- whatever that may now mean -- agencies are being affected by changes in accounts for large advertisers like the Coca-Cola Company and the Burger King Corporation, with billings estimated at $575 million. But normality these days includes profit warnings and layoffs, too, as several announcements late last week underscored the fragility of the advertising economy.
2001-09-28	In this new campaign, the words of the advertisers are written on the subway walls.	SUBWAY passengers in Atlanta who looked through the dark windows of their moving train yesterday saw glowing full-motion ads for Dasani, the bottled water from the Coca-Cola Company. The start of the unusual advertising campaign, originally scheduled for Sept. 11, the day of the terrorist attacks, was a quiet event, but it may herald a new age in outdoor advertising. City transit systems are emblazoning the dirt and graffiti-covered walls of subway tunnels with illuminated signs that, when seen from a speeding train, appear to be animated. The effect, similar to that of a flip book, is not unlike watching a 30-second television commercial.
2001-09-27	Coca-Cola and Procter Call Off Joint Venture	Coca-Cola machines will not be dispensing cans of Pringles around the world after all. The Coca-Cola Company and Procter & Gamble called off plans yesterday for a joint venture that the companies announced in February.
2001-09-26	COCA-COLA AGAIN REDUCES ESTIMATE OF SALES VOLUME	The Coca-Cola Company cut its estimate of this year's volume sales for a second time on concern that demand in the United States may slow. Case sales will rise 4 percent to 5 percent in 2001, the company said in a statement, less than the 5 percent to 6 percent projected in April. As recently as 1997, sales rose as much as 9 percent. Third-quarter case sales will rise 4 percent to 5 percent, Coca-Cola said, in line with analysts' estimates. The reduced forecast means growth at Coca-Cola will be little changed from last year, when case sales rose 4 percent.
2001-09-11	COSTA RICA INVESTIGATING COCA-COLA AND BOTTLER	The Coca-Cola Company and Panamerican Beverages Inc. are being investigated by Costa Rica's antitrust commission to determine if they engaged in illegal sales practices to shut out competitors. The investigation follows a complaint by PepsiCo Inc. and three other beverage companies in Costa Rica. The complaint said Coca-Cola and its bottler, Panamerican, sought to squeeze competition through exclusive agreements with retailers, the commission said. Panamerican Beverages, Latin America's biggest bottler, and Coca-Cola could be fined as much as 10 percent of their annual sales in Costa Rica if found in violation.
2001-09-09	Private Sector; Amid the Toasts, A Subtle Soda War	Once, Vicente Fox was president of Coca-Cola of Mexico. Now he is president of the country. So it was no surprise that Douglas N. Daft, chief executive of Coca-Cola, was among the 136 people receiving a coveted invitation to George W. Bush's first state dinner, honoring Mr. Fox, on Wednesday. But Coke's archrival, PepsiCo, was there, too -- Roger A. Enrico, the vice chairman and former chief executive, was a guest. The two executives were the only representatives of corporate America among the athletes and politicians from Mexico, Washington and Texas.
2001-09-02	Word for Word/Deep Water; 'Just Say No to H20' (Unless It's Coke's Own Brew)	IN this age of branding, even plain old milk needs a big ad campaign and celebrity endorsements. But another popular beverage, tap water, has no such support -- a tactical misstep that has left it vulnerable to aggressive competitors like the Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola offered a glimpse of its battle plan against tap water in an article on one of its Web sites headlined ''The Olive Garden Targets Tap Water & WINS.'' Aimed at restaurants selling the company's fountain drinks, the article laid out Coke's antiwater program for the Olive Garden chain as a ''success story'' for others to emulate.
2001-08-25	European Union Stalls Coke-Nestlé Venture	The European Commission asked the Coca-Cola Company, the No. 1 soft-drink maker, and Nestlé S.A., the largest food company, to resubmit a proposal to expand their joint venture for ready-to-serve beverages because their original notification was incomplete. ''The commission has come to the conclusion it cannot reach a decision as some information is missing,'' said Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the European Union. She did not say what additional information regulators were seeking.
2001-08-24	Tap Water, in a Bottle	To the Editor: It should come as no surprise that the Coca-Cola Company developed a program to discourage restaurant customers from drinking tap water (Business Day, Aug. 20). It is not alone. Robert S. Morrison, vice chairman of PepsiCo, said in 2000, ''The biggest enemy is tap water.''
2001-08-20	Compressed Data; Having Customers Say No to Tap Water	Coca-Cola Co Web site for restaurants drops article that explained how company helped Olive Garden restaurant chain develop program that taught restaurant workers to discourage customers from drinking tap water; word of article spread to several Web logs; article held that goal of program was to make customers happier and that higher profits were side effect; photo (M)
2001-08-17	'Boy' by Rockwell Back in Coke's Den	A Norman Rockwell painting, missing for 70 years, has been discovered -- and purchased by the Coca-Cola Company for an undisclosed amount. The painting, ''The Barefoot Boy,'' which was made for a Coca-Cola calendar of 1931, was owned by a retired executive of a printing company. He had obtained it from the firm that produced the original calendar. The calendar with the painting, depicting a Tom Sawyer-like boy with his dog and a bottle of Coca-Cola, was the company's most popular, with two million copies printed. The image also appeared in window displays and on outdoor posters. Rockwell's model, Dan Grant, was an 11-year-old child actor who appeared in the movie ''Tom Sawyer'' with Jackie Coogan and in ''The Champ'' with Cooper and Wallace Beery. Mr. Grant, 82, lives in Hollister, Calif.
2001-08-16	P.& G. AND COKE SCALE BACK JOINT VENTURE	The Procter & Gamble Company and the Coca-Cola Company scaled back plans for a joint venture to sell Minute Maid and Sunny Delight juices and Pringles potato chips after Coca-Cola balked at giving up its faster-growing lines. Each company will keep its individual brands instead of contributing them to the venture as announced in February, Procter & Gamble said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The companies are in talks to distribute Procter & Gamble's Pringles on Coca-Cola's beverage trucks and to set up a smaller venture to sell healthy drinks, Procter & Gamble said. Coca-Cola decided to shrink the project because it wanted to retain its growing Minute Maid and Hi-C lines, while sales of Procter & Gamble's food and beverages fell 11 percent in the past year.
2001-07-31	BIG BOY RESTAURANTS SAYS 'NO COKE. PEPSI'	The restaurant chain Big Boy Restaurants International has chosen PepsiCo as its exclusive beverage supplier, replacing the Coca-Cola Company, its supplier for 65 years. Big Boy, based in Warren, Mich., said the agreement called for PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., to supply fountain beverages, frozen carbonated beverages and bottled drinks in 170 Big Boy outlets. Big Boy said yesterday that it had made the decision partly because of Pepsi's efforts to maintain quality. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., has also developed a intranet site that will permit the restaurants to communicate with company headquarters, Big Boy said.
2001-07-18	Coke Bottler To Eliminate 2,000 Jobs	Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling company responsible for about 80 percent of Coca-Cola's soft drink sales in North America, will cut 2,000 jobs, or 3 percent of its work force, the company said yesterday. The company also reported a drop in its earnings for the second quarter that was larger than Wall Street's forecasts. It plans to take a charge of $60 million to $80 million against its earnings for the second half of the year to revamp its operations.
2001-07-07	Coca-Cola Still Faces Suits In Race Discrimination Case	Despite reaching the largest settlement ever in a racial bias case, the Coca-Cola Company will continue to face lawsuits from current and former black employees, a Florida law firm representing some of the workers said yesterday. At least 17 of the 23 black employees who chose not to participate in the $192.5 million settlement will pursue lawsuits of their own, according to the firm. They decided that the recompense Coca-Cola offered did not make up for the discrimination they endured at the company, the firm said.
2001-06-23	EXECUTIVE CHANGES	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES INC., Atlanta, a bottler of Coca-Cola drinks, named G. David Van Houten Jr. executive vice president and president of its new North American unit, which combines the company's western and eastern North America groups. He had been president at the western group. William A. Holl, former president at the eastern group, was named corporate senior vice president.
2001-06-21	Coca-Cola Joins AIDS Fight in Africa	Coca-Cola, Africa's biggest employer, if affiliates are counted, says it will use its resources to combat AIDS on the continent. The company announced, in partnership with Unaids, the joint United Nations agency, that it will use its advertising ability and its distribution network rather than contribute cash. For example, a spokesman said, the company might help Kenya design anti-AIDS advertisements and hand over use of its three big billboards in downtown Nairobi. Or it might carry literature on AIDS to 2,500 volunteer centers in Zambia.
2001-05-30	Judge Is Set to Authorize Bias Settlement With Coke	A federal judge said yesterday that he planned to authorize a $192.5 million settlement of a discrimination lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Company, giving the final seal of approval to the largest settlement ever in a racial bias case. The decision by the judge, Richard W. Story of United States District Court in Atlanta, would clear the way for more than 2,000 current and former black employees of Coke to receive an average of about $40,000 each and appeared to close the chapter on a two-year legal battle that had thrust the company's racial discord onto the world stage.
2001-05-27	Stressed Out? Bad Knee? Relief Promised in a Juice	To the befuddlement of scientists and regulators, many of the largest food manufacturers are embellishing their products with the active ingredients found in dietary supplements and traditional herbal medicines, some of which may not be effective, or even safe. Major brands like Snapple now promise to ''enlighten your senses'' by brewing herbs like ginkgo biloba into bottles of iced tea. Celestial Seasonings urges consumers to steep away their stresses with kava, a sedative root from the South Seas now found in its Tension Tamer cocktail.
2001-05-21	Decisions Made On Big Accounts	Two big advertisers have made decisions on accounts. The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta expanded its relationship with Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., by naming the agency to handle the account of its Powerade sports drink, with billings estimated at more than $30 million. The brand had been handled for about a decade by the New York and Seattle offices of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
2001-05-10	Agencies Named For Accounts	Agencies have been named to handle accounts. Ecco, the shoe company based in Bredebro, Denmark, selected the New York office of Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, to handle its first worldwide advertising assignment. Billings were estimated at $20 million to $25 million.
2001-04-27	Metro Business Briefing; COCA-COLA IN TIMES SQUARE	The Coca-Cola Company, which has advertised in Times Square for more than 80 years, extended its lease there for an additional 10 years, it was announced yesterday. The company signed a lease extension with Sherwood Outdoor, which owns and leases billboard space for several prime properties in Times Square, keeping its neon logo at 2 Times Square through 2011. The sign could soon be one of the only large neon ones left in Times Square, said Brian T. Turner, president of Sherwood Outdoor. Suntory Whisky, which has a sign just above Coca-Cola's, does not plan to renew its lease, and Samsung, which has a sign above Suntory's, is to remove the neon when it renovates its sign. Coca-Cola and Sherwood would not disclose the rent, but the company that will lease the Suntory space will pay roughly $2.5 million a year, said one local landlord. Corey Kilgannon
2001-04-22	Braving War and Graft, Coke Goes Back to Angola	THIS ghost of a bustling industrial town is just over 30 miles from the safety of the capital, Luanda, a fearfully long distance in a country at war for decades, where guerrilla attacks skirt the cities with unsettling regularity. The road to the capital is off limits from dusk to dawn. A few weeks ago, rebels attacked the nearby town of Calomboloca. killing some residents and abducting others. And earlier in neighboring Catete, at least four people were killed in a rebel attack.
2001-04-19	Coke Is Again Profitable; Still, It Sees Slower Growth	Conceding that its long-awaited recovery may not be as spectacular as promised, the Coca-Cola Company announced a rebound in its quarterly results yesterday, but also cut its growth forecasts to the lowest level in about 20 years. Coke said that first-quarter earnings resurged from the disappointments of last year, when a wave of layoffs and asset write-downs crimped the company's profits by hundreds of millions of dollars.
2001-04-19	PHILIPPINES: BOTTLER DEAL	Coca-Cola Amatil of Australia dismissed speculation in news reports that a proxy battle being waged for control of the San Miguel Corporation would derail Amatil's Feb. 6 deal to sell its Philippine bottling business to San Miguel and the Coca-Cola Company. ''That's going forward to shareholders on the 27th of April as planned,'' said Ian Brown, an Amatil spokesman. He said Amatil had heard nothing from San Miguel or the Philippine government to indicate a problem. San Miguel's annual meeting is set for May 3. Becky Gaylord
2001-04-17	Account Review Is Set For Coke's Powerade	The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta is placing in review the account of its Powerade sports drink, which has been handled for about a decade by the New York and Seattle offices of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Advertising executives who were told of Coca-Cola's plans confirmed a report of the review this week in Advertising Age. Coca-Cola spent $32 million last year to advertise Powerade, according to CMR, which tracks ad spending. That figure may be increased significantly this year because the primary Powerade competitor, Gatorade, is being acquired by the primary Coca-Cola competitor, PepsiCo Inc., as part of PepsiCo's planned acquisition of the Quaker Oats Company.
2001-04-13	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES APPOINTS CHIEF EXECUTIVE	Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler of Coca-Cola Company beverages, has named Lowry F. Kline chief executive, succeeding Summerfield K. Johnston Jr., who is retiring. Mr. Johnston, 69, will remain chairman, while the president and chief operating officer, John R. Alm, will be elected to the board on April 20. Mr. Kline will also continue as vice chairman. Coca-Cola, the largest soft drink maker, owns about 40 percent of the bottler. The shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises rose 49 cents, to $16.85.
2001-04-12	Anheuser-Busch Joins Industry Promotion	A campaign by the American Advertising Federation in Washington to promote the value of advertising, made more timely by the economic slowdown, has signed another well-known marketer as a participant. The Anheuser-Busch Companies in St. Louis joins the three marketers that agreed to take part when the campaign began in October: Coca-Cola, Energizer and Sunkist. The campaign -- carrying the theme ''Advertising. The way great brands get to be great brands'' -- is meant to encourage marketers to spend more to build brands, whatever the state of the economy.
2001-03-25	And for Best Supporting Soda . . .	Last week, as Hollywood went into its annual pre-Oscar pamper-fest, celebrities were showered with free designer clothes, beauty treatments, hair styling, jewels and . . . Diet Coke? Yes, Diet Coke. For the five days preceding the awards ceremony, the Coca-Cola Company delivered galvanized steel tubs, each containing 100 cans of Diet Coke cooled by blue ice, to a battery of Los Angeles style spots. Included on the delivery route: the Anastasia Salon, Frédéric Fekkai, Fred Segal Beauty, Privé Salon, Gucci, Armani, Prada, Escada, Bulgari and the Jimmy Choo suite at L'Ermitage hotel. To fully cover all celebrity bases, the tubs, which were silk-screened with the Diet Coke logo and wrapped with red, white and silver ribbons, were also placed at talent agencies like Endeavor, Creative Artists and William Morris.
2001-03-23	Celebrity Voices To Pitch Diet Coke	The Coca-Cola Company will begin its first campaign in two years for Diet Coke, with commercials featuring the voices of celebrities. Carrying the theme ''That certain something,'' the campaign was retooled after another campaign featuring celebrities, with the theme ''Live it up. Drink it down,'' was scrapped last year because of the strike by actors against advertisers.

2001-03-20	Few Plaintiffs Opt Out of Coca-Cola Discrimination Settlement	A $192.5 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit that accused the Coca-Cola Company of racial discrimination cleared a potential hurdle yesterday when only 23 members of the class chose to opt out. Members of the class covered by the settlement had until yesterday to notify lawyers that they did not want to participate. If more than 200 people had opted out, Coke could have canceled the settlement.
2001-03-16	Coca-Cola Selects Former Labor Secretary to Lead Diversity Task Force	The Coca-Cola Company and the plaintiffs in a class-action discrimination lawsuit against the company said yesterday that Alexis M. Herman, the former labor secretary, would be the chairwoman of a panel that will oversee the company's diversity efforts. The seven-member panel, created by the terms of a settlement of the suit, has the power to make binding recommendations about how the company hires, promotes and evaluates employees who are women or minorities. Unless Coke receives a court waiver, it must follow the panel's recommendations.
2001-03-16	Making New Friends At Procter & Gamble; Company Seeks Partners as Part Of a Makeover	A decade ago, Procter & Gamble's paper towel production line in Albany, Ga., would jerk to an unexpected stop more than a hundred times a day, sending dozens of towel sheets to the recycling bin each time. So Procter & Gamble developed a toolbox of technical and statistical innovations that calculated the cost of such interruptions while also helping to prevent them. The company credits what it calls reliability engineering for saving billions of dollars since 1990.
2001-03-15	As Deadline Nears, Fate of Racial Bias Accord at Coke Is Uncertain	A groundswell of dissatisfaction has formed among the African-Americans who settled a discrimination lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Company, threatening to destabilize or even derail the nation's largest settlement ever in a racial bias case. In recent weeks, hundreds of current and former employees of the company, all of whom are covered under the settlement, have been meeting in Atlanta churches, without their lawyers' knowledge, to vent their frustrations and put together an alternative to the $192 million accord reached in November.
2001-03-13	IMI TO ELIMINATE JOBS	IMI P.L.C. of Britain, which supplies drink dispensers to the Coca-Cola Company, said it would cut 1,200 jobs to cut costs amid weakening demand for carbonated drinks. The company will take a charge of £40 million ($58.7 million) this year and £20 million ($29.3 million) next year, said Trevor Slack, IMI's finance director. Most of the cuts will come in the United States and Germany, as IMI shifts production to China and Mexico. Earnings at IMI's drink dispenser unit, which accounts for 20 percent of its sales, fell 3.5 percent last year as consumer tastes shifted away from carbonated soda to mineral water and fruit drinks.
2001-03-05	President Quits at Coca-Cola As Broad Revamping Begins	As part of its continued efforts to revive its beverage business, the Coca-Cola Company announced a series of sweeping management changes yesterday. Under the direction of Douglas N. Daft, who took over as chairman and chief executive about a year ago, Coke will be divided into four business units. Jack L. Stahl, who had worked at Coke for two decades, has resigned as president and chief operating officer.
2001-03-04	Carnival Love Fest Turns Beverage-Maker Brawl	The theme of this year's Carnival in Brazil was peace, along with the usual street partying, samba dancing, love and sex. But for two superpowers in the beverage industry, the theme was war. The Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest soft-drink maker, battled Brazil's Cia. de Bebidas das Americas, or Ambev, one of the world's largest brewers, to slake the thirsts of tens of thousands of scantily clad Brazilians and tourists.
2001-03-02	COCA-COLA EXPECTED TO REGAIN CONCESSION CONTRACT	Recapturing the contract that it lost 10 years ago, the Coca-Cola Company is expected to announce today that it has reached an agreement to become the exclusive soft drink of the nation's largest airports. Coke forged the deal, worth an estimated $35 million, with HMSHost, the company that runs the concession stands and restaurants at 60 airports in North America, including 18 of the 20 largest ones. Many of the Starbucks, Burger Kings and other franchise restaurants in airports from Miami to Chicago are operated by the company, formerly part of the Host Marriott Corporation, and they have been serving Pepsi for a decade.

2001-02-22	Coke and Procter & Gamble In Joint Marketing Venture	Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola announced yesterday that they would form a company to manufacture and market Pringles chips and the two companies' juice and fruit-flavored drinks, splitting the profits. The company will have annual sales of $4 billion. Coca-Cola and Procter officials estimate that cost savings and new products will create an additional $200 million in annual pretax profit by 2005.
2001-02-20	In the wake of a sales setback, Sprite's advertising is revised.	THE advertising for Sprite, the popular lemon-lime soft drink sold by the Coca-Cola Company, is being revised significantly for the first time in almost seven years, following a rare decline in the brand's sales and market share. Sprite has been aimed at teenagers and 20-somethings with a cheery $70 million campaign, influenced by hip-hop culture, that carries the theme ''Obey your thirst.'' The commercials, print ads, posters and promotions that compose the campaign, created by Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide in New York, have sought to capitalize on the skepticism of the intended audience by spoofing traditional marketing ploys for soft drinks, sneakers and other over-hyped consumer goods.
2001-02-13	Camp/Arbues Principal Is Leaving Agency	Roger Camp, principal and creative director at Camp/Arbues in San Francisco, is leaving as of March 1 to become one of two creative directors on the important Diet Coke account at Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. Mr. Camp, 31, assumes the art director's duties that had been handled by Dan Wieden, chief executive, and will work with Todd Waterbury, 34, creative director and copywriter. Mr. Camp will be joining the agency just before the first television commercials are scheduled to begin running for the diet brand from the Coca-Cola Company, in a campaign carrying the theme ''Live it up. Drink it down.'' The print ads began appearing last year before the TV spots, which were postponed because of the actors' strike.
2001-02-07	PHILIPPINES COKE BOTTLER BOUGHT	Coke's bottling operation in the Philippines has fallen back into local hands with the acquisition of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines by the San Miguel Corporation and the Coca-Cola Company. Coke and San Miguel, the country's largest food and beverage company, agreed to buy the bottler from Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. of Australia for $1.24 billion. The deal will give San Miguel 65 percent of the bottler, as well as management control. Coke will own the rest. San Miguel had owned Coke's Philippine franchise since 1927 but gave up control in 1997 for shares in Amatil. Mark Landler
2001-02-05	Patents; Many companies will forgo patents in an effort to safeguard their trade secrets.	A COUPLE who bought their house nearly 30 years ago from Harland Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, learned last week that a handwritten note they discovered in their basement in 1999 did not reveal Mr. Sanders's famous secret recipe. While the couple, Tommy and Cherry Settle, of Shelbyville, Ky., may have been disappointed that the scribbled list of 11 herbs and spices was not the legendary fried chicken formula, they were probably relieved to escape a lawsuit initiated by the KFC Corporation, owner of the chicken fast-food chain.
2001-02-04	Toasting Cheney's Victory With Coke? This Is Loyalty?	In the cultic world of soda mythology, it has long been said that Democrats are devoted to Coca-Cola, while Republicans bear a tireless loyalty to Pepsi. For decades now, the myth has been stoked with stories of President Jimmy Carter's taking Coke machines into the White House and President George Bush (the first one) serving Pepsi aboard Air Force One. As the legend goes, nary an election comes without the two companies lining up behind the warring candidates to reinforce their partisan tastes.
2001-02-01	Coca-Cola Earnings Gain But Sales Are Lackluster	Capping off a trying year marred by layoffs, lawsuits and a tougher consumer market for sodas, the Coca-Cola Company announced a sharp rebound in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, but its sluggish sales raised questions about whether it has enough momentum to accomplish the full turnaround it has pledged for 2001. Given Coke's lackluster growth of little more than 1 percent last year in soda sales in the United States, the company will have a hard time pulling off the 6 percent to 7 percent gains it has promised Wall Street, analysts said.
2001-01-31	NESTLÉ AND COKE EXPAND PARTNERSHIP	Nestlé S.A. plans to expand its joint venture for ready-to-drink beverages with the Coca-Cola Company to enter new markets and segments. Nestlé and Coca-Cola plan to rename their partnership, which has existed since 1991, Beverage Partners Worldwide. The equally owned venture, whose products include tea and coffee, currently operates in 24 countries, including Canada, Germany and Hong Kong. The partnership allows Nestlé to sell some of its products through Coca-Cola's distribution network. Beverage Partners Worldwide will focus on marketing and sales of ready-to-drink beverages that are sold in places ranging from grocery stores and vending machines to gas stations and cinemas.

2000-12-14	CARLSBERG MAKES COKE CONCESSIONS TO SECURE ORKLA	Carlsberg, the large brewer, agreed to stop selling Coca-Cola products in Sweden to win antitrust approval for its purchase of Orkla's breweries, Swedish regulators said. Carlsberg and Orkla will also sell seven of their beer brands -- Three Towns, Fat, Arboga, Eagle, Bayerbrau, Starkbock and Sailor -- and give up rights to five imported beers. The divestitures will trim the companies' combined share of the Swedish market to 45 percent from 56 percent. Orkla is based in Oslo and Carlsberg in Stockholm.
2000-12-04	Interpublic takes on a challenging new role in defining the brand essence of Coke Classic.	THE recent decision by the Coca-Cola Company to place the Interpublic Group of Companies in charge of the ''brand essence'' of its flagship product is emblematic of the innovative -- and risky -- ways that marketers and agencies are joining forces to try solving problems. The decision, disclosed on Friday and effective early in 2001, reinforced a relationship that dates back decades but had weakened during the 1990's as Coca-Cola formed ties with dozens of agencies not owned by Interpublic. Under the arrangement, Interpublic is to use a new advisory council to develop a variety of strategic and creative marketing communications concepts. The goal is to help Coca-Cola stimulate flagging sales of its principal brand, called Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola in 198 other countries.
2000-12-02	Coke Forms Alliance With Interpublic	One of the world's largest advertisers, the Coca-Cola Company, is hiring one of the world's largest advertising agency companies, the Interpublic Group of Companies, to coordinate the marketing for its flagship soft-drink brand. The company spends an estimated $1 billion annually on all forms of advertising and marketing for the brand, called Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola or Coke elsewhere around the world. Under the alliance, Interpublic will form a marketing communications advisory council that will recommend how and where the brand identity of Coke should be presented to consumers. It will be up to bottlers in local countries to determine which agencies will create the campaigns.
2000-11-23	Coke's Retreat Puts Quaker Back in Play	The collapse of Coca-Cola's $16 billion bid to acquire Quaker Oats prompted rival bidders yesterday to re-evaluate their acquisition strategies and raised discussion about the implications for Coke's chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft. With Coke no longer in the running, Danone of France, the producer of Evian bottled water and Dannon yogurt, issued a statement yesterday signaling its renewed interest in acquiring Quaker and its most prized brand, Gatorade. Danone made an offer for Quaker last week, according to executives close to the talks, but Quaker's board rebuffed the bid in favor of a deal with Coke.
2000-11-21	Quaker Oats Battle Comes Down to Getting Gatorade	The war for Quaker Oats can be summed up in one word: Gatorade. The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo have both been in talks to acquire Quaker Oats because it would mean winning Gatorade, one of the world's fastest-growing beverages, with more than $1.8 billion in sales a year ago.
2000-11-20	Coca-Cola Reported in Talks To Acquire Quaker Oats	The Coca-Cola Company is in serious talks to acquire Quaker Oats, the maker of Gatorade, in an effort to expand its position in the lucrative noncarbonated-drink business, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday. The talks come on the heels of a $14.8 billion acquisition offer by PepsiCo that was rejected as too low by Quaker Oats' chief executive, Robert Morrison.
2000-11-18	No Instant Results Expected From Coke Bias Case	A day after disclosing plans for an overhaul of the Coca-Cola Company to make sure minorities and women are promoted and paid fairly, plaintiffs' lawyers and company officials said many of the details were still unclear and cautioned that tangible results could be a long way off. ''You can plant the seeds today, but you may not see the fruits for a couple of years,'' said Coretha M. Rushing, a senior vice president for human resources.
2000-11-17	COCA-COLA SETTLES RACIAL BIAS CASE	In the largest settlement ever in a racial discrimination case, the Coca-Cola Company agreed yesterday to pay more than $156 million to resolve a federal lawsuit brought by black employees. The settlement also mandates that the company make sweeping changes, costing an additional $36 million, and grants broad monitoring powers to a panel of outsiders -- an unusual concession in employment discrimination cases.
2000-11-10	COCA-COLA SAYS IT WILL INVEST $1 BILLION IN BRAZIL	Coca-Cola will invest $1.01 billion in Brazil through 2002 to step up production there, including expanding a plant at Manaus, the company said yesterday. Brazil is the No. 3 market for Coca-Cola, which gets more than half its sales outside the United States. Last year, Coca-Cola exported $100 million of soft drink concentrate from its Brazil plant, which is in a free-trade zone where companies receive tax incentives to set up exporting and importing businesses.
2000-10-30	A Shareholder Sues Coca-Cola, Saying It Misled Investors	The Coca-Cola Company has been sued by a shareholder who says the company misled investors and artificially inflated its stock price, according to a statement released by the plaintiff's law firm, Chitwood & Harley. The lawsuit requesting class-action status accuses high-ranking Coca-Cola officials of driving up the company's share price by forcing bottlers to buy excessive amounts of beverage concentrate, the lawyers said last week. The soft drink maker concealed this information from investors, the lawyers and the suit said.
2000-10-28	MEXICO INVESTIGATES COKE	Mexico's antitrust commission said it began a formal proceeding against Coca-Cola to determine if it was guilty of monopolistic practices in Mexico. Coke, which had a 64.6 percent share of Mexico's $5 billion soft drink industry last year, has been accused by competitors of placing unfair exclusivity demands on stores that stock its products. The decision comes after representatives of the commission and Coke failed to negotiate an agreement. The affair has led to a dispute between Coke and PepsiCo Inc., the company that had accused Coke of violating fair trade practices. Coke said Pepsi refused to negotiate a settlement, but Pepsi said Coke refused to accept its latest offer. Graham Gori (NYT)
2000-10-24	Coke Calls On Former Officer To Guide It in a New Culture	When Douglas Daft, chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, first introduced his ''think local, act local'' strategy earlier this year, it sounded to many like a radical departure from the centralized, monolithic culture that had prevailed at Coke in recent years. In may ways, it was. Mr. Daft's predecessor, M. Douglas Ivester, earned a reputation for making all but the smallest decisions himself, leaving many Coke executives around world with the numbing sense that they could do little without his direct approval.
2000-10-20	Coke Issuing Widespread Pay Increases	Struggling to retain employees after a turbulent year, the Coca-Cola Company has instituted sweeping salary increases for the first time in at least two decades, according to company officials. The raises, ranging from less than $1,000 to as much as $15,000, came after the company determined that many of its workers were paid less than their counterparts at other large companies, a criticism Coke employees have leveled for years.
2000-10-04	Coke Asia Franchise Rejects Bid for Units	Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd., the No. 1 soft drink producer in the Asia-Pacific region, said today that it had rejected an offer from Coca-Cola and the San Miguel Corporation to buy its Asian units. Amatil, based here, said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange that it had received a joint proposal involving the sale of its businesses in the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea in return for the cancellation of some of its shares held by the two companies and some debt relief. San Miguel, of Manila, owns 21.5 percent of Coca-Cola Amatil. Coca-Cola has 37 percent.
2000-09-21	Coca-Cola Office in Spain Raided in Inquiry Into Business Practices	In an early morning raid yesterday, the Spanish authorities seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola and its bottlers, investigating complaints that the companies had used illegal business tactics to keep rival soft drinks off the country's shelves. Acting on complaints filed last year by PepsiCo and La Casera, a Spanish beverage company, officials from the Ministry of Economy appeared without warning at Coke's corporate offices in Madrid, where they spent several hours looking through records pertaining to the company's competitive practices. Investigators also confiscated documents from three independent companies that bottle and distribute Coke across Spain, responding to complaints that they, too, had pressed stores and restaurants not to carry other brands.
2000-09-20	PepsiCo Loses To Coca-Cola In Court Fight	A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit yesterday by PepsiCo that accused Coca-Cola of unfairly wielding its influence to control the beverages served in restaurants, movie theaters and other businesses. Filed two years ago in United States District Court in Manhattan, the lawsuit challenged Coke's widespread use of ''loyalty'' contracts with food-service distributors, the independent vendors who provide restaurants, convenience stores and sports arenas with everything from cups to ketchup to the syrupy concentrate used in fountain drinks. Through these agreements, Pepsi asserted, Coke pressed the distributors to carry its fountain syrup exclusively, effectively barring Pepsi's ability to compete in a $2.3 billion category that is outpacing the rest of the soda market.
2000-09-11	Coca-Cola Signs Deal On Programming TV's	Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink company, has signed a two-year strategic partnership agreement with Replay TV in Mountain View, Calif., which sells a service and digital video recorder that allows consumers to pause, replay, rewind and fast-forward through live television programming. Terms were not disclosed. ''We think this technology will become a part of consumers' lives,'' said Chuck Fruit, vice president and director for media and marketing assets at Coca-Cola in Atlanta, ''so we've got some experimentation and learning to do.''
2000-09-01	COKE IS BUYING REMAINING STAKE IN LITHUANIAN FACTORY	The Coca-Cola Company's Lithuanian subsidiary said yesterday that it had bought the government's remaining 22.96 percent stake in the Lithuanian factory that makes its soft drinks, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary. A spokesman for Coca-Cola Bottlers Lietuva, Coca-Cola's distribution subsidiary in Lithuania, said it would pay 3.5 million litas ($875,000) for the stake. Coke bought a 77.04 percent stake in the Alytus bottling plant in 1994, setting up Coca-Cola Bottlers Lietuva at the same time.
2000-08-24	Coca-Cola to Award Some Early Bonuses	The Coca-Cola Company said this week that it would pay some workers half of their annual bonuses early. About 9,000 employees, or one-third of Coca-Cola's work force, will receive half of their bonuses by the end of the month, a company spokesman, Ben Deutsch, said. Eligible workers include management and professional workers, he said.
2000-08-18	People	* Jimmy Siegel was promoted to executive vice president and executive creative director at the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Mr. Siegel, who had been senior vice president and senior creative director, becomes the fourth top creative executive at the agency, reporting to Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief creative officer. * Howard Karel was named worldwide account director on the Johnson & Johnson account at the New York office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. He succeeds Ned Russell, who left to become chief operating officer at the Wolf Group New York. Mr. Karel had been regional director for the Procter & Gamble account in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at the London office of Leo Burnett Worldwide, part of the B Com3 Group. * Nick Bishop, executive vice president and managing director at McCann-Erickson/A&L, was named to the new post of vice president for consumer connections at the marketing division of the Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, responsible for overall creative strategy development as well as incorporating strategy with local markets. McCann-Erickson/ A&L is a division of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of the McCann-Erickson World Group, part of the Interpublic Group of Cos. * Jeff Einstein was named to the new position of director for interactive for North America at Rapp Digital Communications, New York, part of the Rapp Collins Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. He had been chief operating officer at Quality of Life Networks Inc., New York. Also, Blake E. Froehlich was named vice president and director for interactive at Rapp Digital, Dallas. He had most recently been director for client services at the San Francisco office of Modem Media, 46 percent owned by True North Communications. * Robert Cunningham was named president at ePartners, Marina del Rey, Calif., a new division of Direct Partners, part of the Omnicom Group, that will focus on customer and brand marketing through the Internet. He had most recently been senior partner at Ogilvy One Worldwide, New York, part of the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide unit of the WPP Group.
2000-08-16	MANAGEMENT: Cornering the Corner Office; Chief Executives Have More Staying Power These Days	Durk I. Jager lasted 17 months at the helm of Procter & Gamble, resigning last month after the shortest tenure of any chief executive in the company's 163-year history. The board of Mattel asked for the resignation of the company's leader, Jill E. Barad, this year after only three years. M. Douglas Ivester, after years of being groomed for Coca-Cola's top job, quit in February after two years in it. The evidence seems compelling that chief executives at America's largest companies have less staying power than they did just a few years ago. The stock market is far more volatile than it used to be, management experts say, and directors punish poor results swiftly.
2000-08-06	How Coke Pushed Rivals Off the Shelf	DRIVE around this exceptionally hot and thirsty place in midsummer, when the mercury regularly tops 100 but people still have to sell watermelons from their trucks and take their places on the production lines at Lone Star Steel and get their chores done along the plain-looking downtown streets, and you begin to understand why it turned into prime territory for the latest skirmish in the cola wars. It was here, in the state courthouse off Route 259, that lawyers for nine bottlers and distributors of Royal Crown Cola squared off this spring against the Coca-Cola Company and its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. The trial took place six years after the Royal Crown group sued Coke and its bottler.
2000-08-02	Ex-Manager Urges Coke's Black Workers to Hire Lawyers	A former Coca-Cola benefits manager who has criticized the company's treatment of black workers said yesterday that he would urge those workers to retain lawyers to help them determine whether they should accept a settlement reached in June between Coke and four black employees who sued the company or file their own suits. The manager, Larry Jones, plans to hold a news conference on Friday in Atlanta. He said yesterday that he would tell his former colleagues not to wait until October, when the terms of the settlement will be announced, to assess whether they would be better off as part of the agreement, which covers all black salaried employees from 1995 to the present. Mr. Jones said he was arranging to have lawyers, other than those already involved, help employees decide what action to take. No details of the settlement have been disclosed.
2000-07-20	Coke, Lauding Its Strategy, Says Results Beat Estimates	Declaring that its six-month-old ''think local, act local'' strategy was working in some parts of the world, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings slightly beat analysts' expectations, mainly because of savings from a sweeping reorganization this year. Net income fell to $926 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, from $942 million, or 38 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $5.62 billion from $5.33 billion, mostly because of price increases in some countries and improving economic conditions in others, the company said.
2000-07-20	SoBe beverages plans a strategy to sustain its heady growth.	SINCE it first appeared in stores just four years ago with its lineup of unusual flavors and a distinctive double-lizard logo, SoBe has grown into a Godzilla of the noncarbonated drinks business. This year, the company expects to post $250 million in sales, up from $167 million last year and $67 million in 1998.
2000-07-19	Earnings at Coke Bottler Narrowly Beat Expectations	In results that narrowly beat analysts' expectations, Coca-Cola Enterprises said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 26 percent. Profit from operations at the company, Coca-Cola's largest bottler, increased to $131 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with $104 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
2000-07-16	Private Sector; Making Another Case for Equality	FOR Cyrus Mehri, challenging the status quo is second nature. His Iranian mother was punished in her youth for criticizing the shah. Asked to do a book report in the seventh grade, he chose one written by Abbie Hoffman. He cut his political teeth with Ralph Nader, organizing communities to rise up around issues like telephone rates. Even his birthday, July 14, coincides with a revolutionary milestone, at least for the French. So when he filed a federal lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Company in April 1999, representing four black employees who said they had been denied raises, promotions and other advancement because of their race, it was a fairly typical move for Mr. Mehri, who turned 39 last week.
2000-07-12	Restrictions Put on Lawyer In Bias Case at Coca-Cola	A federal judge yesterday ordered Willie E. Gary, a Florida lawyer who is representing four black former Coca-Cola employees in a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the company, not to interfere with the settlement reached last month between Coke and four other employees with similar claims. Details of the settlement are expected to be announced in October. The company said on June 14 that it had reached a settlement ''in principle,'' and would turn to specialists to work out issues including the size of the cash payments to plaintiffs. The settlement extends to all current and former black salaried Coke employees who have worked at the company since April 1995, and is expected to include policy changes inside the company as well as cash. The plaintiffs contended that they were denied promotions, raises and other advancement because of their race.
2000-07-06	Western Business Tempers Its New Enthusiasm for North Korea	Foreign business optimism over the thaw between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few weeks since their leaders met and a symbolic truckload of Coca-Cola crossed into the North, one of orthodox Communism's last redoubts. The precedent-setting discussions in Pyongyang, the northern capital, between President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and his Communist counterpart, Kim Jong Il, generated a kind of euphoria, and talk was heard of an opening of North Korea, a reclusive nation of 22 million.
2000-06-24	New Player Shakes Up Coca-Cola Bias Case; Some Workers Face a Tough Choice	To his old friend the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Willie E. Gary is ''a bigger-than-life character.'' Indeed, whether the topic is compensation for a client in one of the hundreds of personal-injury cases he has taken on, or the fine points of his private jet, a Gulfstream II soon to be replaced by a Boeing 737, Mr. Gary is a man who thinks in outsized proportions. Mr. Gary, 52, has been practicing law for the last 25 years and presides over his own firm, housed in a baronial waterfront office in Stuart, Fla., half an hour north of Palm Beach. Among his courtroom triumphs was a $500 million award in 1995 for a Mississippi funeral home owner who sued the Loewen Group. It was then the biggest verdict in Mississippi history, and was eventually reduced to $175 million, still a tidy sum.
2000-06-22	COKE IN NORTH KOREA	Coca-Cola sent a single truckload of Coke into North Korea from China yesterday, moving to expand its Korean peninsula sales, which have been struggling over the last year. ''Following the U.S. government announcement that trade sanctions had been partially lifted, we began to supply North Korea with a limited number of company products,'' a company spokesman said. About 75 percent of the company's profits in Asia come from Japan. Constance L. Hays (NYT)
2000-06-20	Pepsi Plans to Offer a Competitor to Sprite	PepsiCo Inc., the world's No. 2 soft drink maker, will sell a new lemon-lime flavored soft drink by year-end to compete with the Coca-Cola Company's fast-growing Sprite. PepsiCo will introduce the soda by the fourth quarter, said a spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky. PepsiCo will end sales of its two current lemon-lime sodas, Slice and Storm, and it may name the new drink Sierra Mist, he said. The new carbonated beverage will not contain caffeine.

The companies, which generate about $500 billion in annual sales, account for more than a third of the $900 billion spent by the consumer-products industry on raw materials and services. Transora.com will begin operations in the fourth quarter.
2000-06-15	Coca-Cola Reaches a Settlement With Some Workers in Bias Suit	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had reached a tentative settlement with several black employees who sued the company 14 months ago, contending that they were denied promotions, raises and other opportunities because of the color of their skin. Within minutes of the settlement announcement, lawyers representing four other black employees filed a new lawsuit against the company in a Georgia state court, asking for $1.5 billion in damages.
2000-05-31	Creative Artists Advising Coca-Cola	The Coca-Cola Company and the Creative Artists Agency will work together again in a strategic consulting agreement that calls for Creative Artists to help Coca-Cola with entertainment marketing for its soft-drink brands worldwide. Terms of the deal, which was announced yesterday, were not disclosed. The goal of the agreement is for Creative Artists, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., to assist Coca-Cola in identifying celebrities, trends, music, movies, television shows and entertainment events that will resonate with consumers and can be connected to Coca-Cola products.
2000-05-22	Coke Buys Time On Turner Networks	The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta and Turner Broadcasting Sales in New York, part of the Turner Broadcasting System unit of Time Warner Inc., signed a 10-year agreement that calls for Coca-Cola to buy commercial time on Turner networks like CNN/SI, the Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, TNT, Turner South and WTBS-TV Channel 17 in Atlanta. Terms were not disclosed. There will also be promotions tied to the 2000 Coca-Cola 600 Nascar Winston Cup race.
2000-05-19	Europe Regulators Raid Coke Offices in Brussels and London	Investigators from the European Commission raided Coca-Cola's office in Brussels early yesterday as well as the office of the company's largest bottler, in London, expanding an inquiry into Coke's marketing practices that began last summer. At issue are many of the methods Coke uses to bolster sales of its soft drinks: contracts that prohibit competitors' products, sales incentive programs and discounts for certain customers. Last July, investigators seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola Beverages in London; the offices of Coke's principal German bottler, Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke, and Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages in Denmark.
2000-05-18	Electronic Payments at Coke Machines	The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers plan to spend $100 million on software made by Marconi P.L.C. that will enable vending machines to take credit and debit cards. Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drink maker, will use a Marconi telecommunications system to connect 500,000 machines worldwide to the Internet and allow electronic payments.
2000-05-17	Saudi Reports $1 Billion of Investments	Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia said today that he had spent $1 billion buying shares in 15 American companies, including Amazon.com, WorldCom, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and AT&T. ''We bought all these companies, which are here for the long run, after their share prices had collapsed by as much as 70 percent,'' Prince Walid said. ''We are not old economy; we are not new economy; we go everywhere there is value and growth potential.''
2000-05-17	Reports Rattle Shares of Coke And Its Bottler	Coca-Cola's largest bottler said yesterday that it would not meet its growth target in the United States this year and that it was facing even bigger hurdles in another major market, Britain. The fortunes of the Coca-Cola Company are closely linked with those of the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, and investors fled both stocks yesterday. Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises tumbled 30 percent, or $6.9375, to $15.625, a 52-week low. Shares of Coca-Cola fell $3, to $48.9375.
2000-05-11	Group Will Persist With Coke Boycott	A group led by a former Coca-Cola benefits manager said today that it would press on with a boycott against the company despite a lack of support from major civil rights organizations. The former benefits manager, Larry Jones, said that his group, the Committee for Corporate Justice, which includes some former and current Coca-Cola employees, will ask Atlanta businesses and churches to remove Coke vending machines and will distribute literature at local transit stations.
2000-05-02	Coke Executive to Become Chief of Motley Fool	The Motley Fool is expected to announce today that C. Patrick Garner, a Coca-Cola Company executive, will become its new chief executive. Mr. Garner, 52, was most recently president of Coca-Cola's Southeast and West Asia division and has spent three decades at the company.
2000-04-20	Group of Black Employees Calls for Boycott of Coca-Cola Products	Intensifying the pressure on Coca-Cola to resolve a racial-discrimination lawsuit that is about to enter its second year, a group of black Coke employees called today for a boycott of Coke products around the world. The appeal was made at Coke's annual shareholder meeting here before an audience packed with the company's investors, directors and executives. In a dramatic finish to a long speech detailing what he called discriminatory practices inside the company, a former benefits manager, Larry Jones, declared that Coke's black employees had waited long enough for fair treatment by the company.
2000-04-19	Coca-Cola Reports a Loss Of $58 Million in Quarter	One day before Coca-Cola's annual meeting with shareholders, which is expected to include protests by black Coca-Cola employees, the company said yesterday that it lost $58 million in the first quarter, much of that because of one-time charges for reorganization. That translated into a loss of 2 cents a diluted share, compared with net income of $747 million, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell to $4.39 billion from $4.40 billion.
2000-04-19	School District Rethinks Its Soda-Pop Strategy	THE school district of Madison, Wis., thought it could have its Coke and drink it, too. In 1997, Madison became a pioneer of sorts, signing a contract that gave Coca-Cola exclusive rights to supply all the district's soda vending machines. The idea was to collect the cash that Coca-Cola was dangling -- a $100,000 signing bonus, plus about $500,000 over the life of the three-year contract -- without yielding to crass commercialism. Madison, the first large school district to sign an exclusive vending contract, thought it could do so without compromising its educational mission.
2000-04-17	Ex-Coke Workers Start Trip To Publicize Racial Dispute	A busload of about four dozen former employees of the Coca-Cola Company and activists began a five-day trip Saturday to draw attention to their frustrations with the soft drink company. Their journey will end Wednesday at the Coca-Cola annual shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Del. The group wants Coca-Cola to settle a racial discrimination suit brought by eight employees nearly a year ago.
2000-04-11	Tiger Woods Group In Coca-Cola Deal	The Coca-Cola Company is forming a partnership with the young professional golfer Tiger Woods by affiliating with his foundation to help in fund-raising activities. Terms were not disclosed. Coca-Cola becomes the ''official'' beverage company of the Tiger Woods Foundation and will sponsor two major foundation events this year: a series of junior golf clinics in local markets across the country and a charity concert tentatively titled ''Tiger Jam.'' Coca-Cola will also begin marketing programs to support the foundation's fund-raising.
2000-04-04	Coke to Disband In-House Agency That Handles Its Flagship Brand	In another sign of how extensively Coca-Cola plans to overhaul the sales and marketing of its soft drinks, the company will disband the unconventional in-house advertising agency that has led the way in creating campaigns for its flagship brand. The decision to close Edge Creative, the upstart agency that has had Coca-Cola as its sole client since 1991, and to reassign its responsibilities to traditional Madison Avenue shops is indicative of the significant shifts the company is making in response to pressure from competitors and investors.
2000-04-02	J.C. Penney Bosses in Stock Bind	MANAGEMENT experts and institutional investors constantly lobby American executives to own more stock in the companies they run. Unlike options -- which, at worst, are worth nothing -- ownership of actual shares brings a downside. When investors lose money, so do the people running the company. In a year when many old-economy stocks declined, that danger became real for top executives. Few lost as much as the bosses at J.C. Penney, the giant retailer, whose stock lost more than half its value during 1999.
2000-03-31	Coca-Cola Previews Summer Promotions	The Coca-Cola Company announced details yesterday of its major promotional effort for the important summer selling season for its flagship product, Coca-Cola Classic. Consumers who buy cans of Coca-Cola Classic in regular and caffeine-free versions will be eligible to win prizes that include trips to Universal Studios and free Cokes. Five prizes of $1 million are also being given away. The goal is to pump up sales of the brand, which have been less than sparkling lately along with sales of its cola competitors.
2000-03-30	Jackson Meets Coke Executives on Minority Issues	The Rev. Jesse Jackson met today with top Coca-Cola executives to discuss the company's treatment of minority and women employees. The meeting came three weeks before the company's annual meeting on April 19, in Wilmington, Del. About 150 current and former Coke employees plan to travel there to protest what they say is discrimination against blacks in pay, promotion and performance evaluation.
2000-03-23	Coke's Black Employees Step Up Pressure To Resolve a Racial Discrimination Lawsuit	At a rally this month, black employees held empty Coke cans aloft outside an Atlanta church to protest Coca-Cola's treatment of blacks. A similar rally is scheduled for Saturday. And when Coca-Cola holds its annual shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Del., on April 19, many of the company's current and former black employees plan to travel to it by bus convoy to make a statement about their frustrations at the company. ''We have an interesting story to tell at the shareholder meeting,'' said Larry Jones, who worked at Coke 15 years, most recently as a benefits manager, before being dismissed last month. ''The company has done such a good job at telling the world what a good company it is, and on the inside, it absolutely does not practice what it preaches.''
2000-03-21	Pepsi Returns To Cola Wars For Campaign	Turning to the past for inspiration, Pepsi-Cola said yesterday that it would revive its ''Pepsi Challenge'' advertising campaign, which features taste tests pitting Pepsi against Coke. With its paper cups and its palate-cleansing cracker, the original Pepsi Challenge, which first appeared in 1975, came to symbolize the cola wars. By exhorting participants to ''let your taste decide,'' the campaign was thought to have goaded the Coca-Cola Company into developing and starting ''New Coke'' in 1985, which turned into one of the biggest new-product failures in soft drink history.
2000-03-12	What Would He Have Made If Profits Had Soared?	Let's see. You're chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, which has just gone through the biggest product recall in its history, accompanied by a deluge of negative publicity that many critics said was partly your fault. Your two attempts to acquire foreign-owned brands to bolster sales are coming apart in Europe. Your company's overall profits are eroding. Isn't it time for a $250,000 raise? Evidently, that is what Coke's board thought last July, when, the latest Coke proxy shows, it increased the base salary of M. Douglas Ivester from $1.25 million to $1.5 million. Mr. Ivester, 52, stepped down last month.
2000-03-10	New Chief Executive of Coke Says Diversity Is a High Priority	In a striking move intended to counter accusations that the Coca-Cola Company has not cared enough about building a diverse work force, Coke's chairman and chief executive said yesterday that management compensation at the company, including his own, would be closely tied to diversity goals that have yet to be announced. ''What gets measured gets done,'' said the executive, Douglas N. Daft, who was elevated to Coke's top job last month. ''Diversity, in its broadest sense, is a clear business imperative for our company and its future, and it is a top priority for me.''
2000-03-06	Coca-Cola Reports a Loss Of $184 Million on Bottling	If there was any question that the Coca-Cola Company's global bottling system ran into trouble last year, the company's latest annual report eliminates it. The report, issued on Friday, shows that Coke lost $184 million on investments in its bottlers. In 1998, it earned $32 million on those investments, a 79 percent decline from the 1997 level.
2000-03-05	National News Briefs; Black Employees Meet Over Issues at Coca-Cola	About 500 current and former employees of the Coca-Cola Company discussed the possibility of a national boycott of the company's products as they met here today to talk about the company's treatment of blacks. The meeting was organized after the company's recent announcement that it would lay off 6,000 workers worldwide, including 2,500 in Atlanta. The company is also facing a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by eight black workers.
2000-03-04	A Hefty Farewell Package For Former Coke Executive	Coca-Cola's former chairman and chief executive left the company last month after two turbulent years in which Coke's growth stagnated, its earnings fell and its image became stained by problems like the biggest product recall in company history and a racial discrimination lawsuit. So dismal was the company's performance in 1999 that no one in Coke's top management got a bonus. Nevertheless, the executive, M. Douglas Ivester, is walking away with a generous bon voyage package -- a total of $17.8 million in payments and other benefits, like stock options that can be immediately vested, as well as the release of nearly two million shares of formerly restricted stock worth about $97.7 million at the close of trading yesterday.
2000-02-27	In Atlanta, Both a Feast and a Famine of Jobs	THE layoff announcements have seemed to come in waves in the last month. The Lockheed Martin Corporation said it would cut 800 workers at its local plant beyond the 2,000 who lost their jobs last year. BellSouth announced that it was eliminating 1,300 local jobs. Worst of all, Coca-Cola, long a bulwark of the economic and social scene here, said that it was laying off 2,500 workers -- 40 percent of its Atlanta work force.
2000-02-23	Another Accusation in Coke Bias Lawsuit	A motion filed in federal court today by plaintiffs in the discrimination suit against the Coca-Cola Company contends ''possible retaliation'' was taken against an employee who organized a meeting of about 150 black workers. But Coke denies the claim. The employee was dismissed within days of the meeting. The workers had come to him worried about job cuts at the company and about documents that laid-off black employees were being asked to sign waiving their rights to sue the company in exchange for enhanced benefits.
2000-02-19	Coca-Cola's Market Share Is Said to Shrink	The Coca-Cola Company's share of the nation's soft drink market slipped in 1999, the first drop in six years, as higher prices cut into sales and consumers shunned cola drinks, an industry newsletter said today. Coca-Cola, the world's biggest soda maker, controlled 44.1 percent of the United States market, a drop of four-tenths of a percentage point from a year earlier, according to the newsletter Beverage Digest and an analyst, John Maxwell Jr. Pepsico's market share was steady at 31.4 percent.
2000-02-18	Transition in the Chief Executive Post at Coca-Cola Comes Early	Douglas N. Daft became chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company yesterday as M. Douglas Ivester moved up his retirement date. Mr. Ivester, 52, shocked the business world in December by saying he would retire after a tumultuous two years in the company's top job, but agreed at the time to stay on until April to smooth the management transition. Mr. Daft, was quickly named his successor and he quickly took charge, reorganizing the company and eliminating the need for Mr. Ivester to remain in office.
2000-02-17	AMBEV TAKES COKE TO COURT	Brazil's biggest beverage company, Companhia de Bebidas das Americas, or AmBev, took legal action in a Rio de Janeiro court against the Coca-Cola Company, accusing the company, the world's leading soft drink maker, of unfair practices. AmBev, a combination of Brazil's two largest beverage concerns under a deal announced last year, said Coke had unfairly sought to influence the Brazilian public against the merger. AmBev's competitors, including the Companhia Cervejaria Kaiser brewery, in which Coke owns a minority stake, have raised concerns about the size of the proposed merger. Kaiser said it would counter AmBev's complaint with its own legal action. Simon Romero
2000-02-11	Brazil Beer-Merger Partners Charge Obstruction by Coke	Two Brazilian breweries that agreed last July to form Latin America's biggest beverage company accused the Coca-Cola Company today of trying to derail their $3.9 billion deal in order to suppress a competitive threat in one of Coke's most important overseas markets. Coca-Cola of Atlanta, the world's leading soft drink producer, denied the accusations made by the merger partners in Companhia de Bebidas das Americas, known as AmBev. But the accusations represented another challenge to Coke's business operations overseas, which have been hit with a variety of problems over the last year.
2000-02-09	Coke in Talks to Resolve Discrimination Suit	In an effort to put one of its largest image problems to rest, the Coca-Cola Company has begun settlement talks with lawyers representing eight current and former black employees who filed a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the company nine months ago. No meetings have been held between Coke's lawyers, the lawyers for the plaintiffs, and the mediator, who has not been identified except as ''a neutral third party'' by the judge, Richard W. Story, who set up the talks.
2000-02-06	Learning to Think Smaller at Coke	AT Coca-Cola, Roberto C. Goizueta remains a legend, the chief executive whose vision and drive transformed the giant company into a global power. For his successor, M. Douglas Ivester, mastery of the inner workings of the Coke system could not make up for an uninterrupted streak of falling profits and personal faux pas. Now the corner office at Coke is to be occupied by Douglas N. Daft, a cheerful, unassuming Australian who spent 30 years rising through the ranks. Practically a stranger in Atlanta, because of his overseas postings and constant travel, in just a few weeks he has turned the world of Coca-Cola upside down.
2000-01-30	All Politics Is Local, Even at Coca-Cola	ATLANTA has seen worse. After all, William Tecumseh Sherman burned the city to the ground. Still, the restructuring announced last week by the Coca-Cola Company -- changes that include paring its work force by 6,000 and taking charges of $1.6 billion -- probably wasn't exactly what the local Chamber of Commerce had in mind.
2000-01-28	A Racial Complaint Over Cutbacks at Coke	A day after the Coca-Cola Company said it would dismiss 6,000 employees worldwide, lawyers for eight workers who have sued the company for racial discrimination contended Coke was improperly coercing black employees to sign away their right to be part of the lawsuit and any eventual judgment. Coke said on Wednesday that it would cut 6,000 people, or one-fifth of its workers, in an effort to make the company more profitable and decentralize many of its operations. Coke plans to take an $800 million charge against earnings in the first half of this year to cover severance payments and other costs associated with the move. The company also said its earnings would shrink further because of less demand for concentrate from bottlers in Japan, Germany and Eastern Europe, and some expect more bad news once the company completes its review of business in other areas, including India.
2000-01-28	Faded Supermarket Dynamos Chase Varying Growth Strategies	Growth companies find it hard to stay on the fast track forever. That truism was made clear this week by Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, two of the world's pre-eminent makers of consumer goods. Coca-Cola announced sweeping layoffs, and P.& G. tried to make a deal for American Home Products and Warner-Lambert. Both moves had one goal: restoring the rapid growth in profits that investors once took for granted.
2000-01-27	Word of All the Layoffs Comes as Shock to Atlanta	The mood at Coca-Cola headquarters was somber today, according to several employees leaving the company's gated compound here, and the reverberations of the job cuts were being discussed throughout the city. Many employees would not speak on the record to a dozen reporters waiting outside the gates this afternoon. ''I still have a job and I want to keep it,'' one man said as he rushed past the group.
2000-01-27	Coca-Cola to Cut 20% of Its Staff After Woes at Home and Abroad	Humbled by a year of problems at home and abroad, Coca-Cola said yesterday that it would cut 6,000 jobs, or a fifth of its global work force of 30,000, in the biggest reductions ever by the company. Word of the job losses reverberated around the company's headquarters in Atlanta, where Coke images dot the skyline from billboards to the baseball stadium, and where the company is long identified with success both personal and collective. About 2,500 employees, or nearly half the people at Coke's gleaming downtown complex, will be let go.
2000-01-26	Orangina's owner still wants to sell brand, if the price is right.	TWO months have passed since the French government halted Coca-Cola's two-year effort to acquire the Orangina brand from Pernod Ricard S.A., the French conglomerate that was more than ready to get rid of it. But the question remains: what's next for Orangina, and for Pernod Ricard, a company that likes to acquire other brands and could have used some extra cash? Stung by the rejection of the deal with Coca-Cola, Pernod Ricard executives say the brand is still for sale, but they are in no rush. They want to get a decent price, even though Coca-Cola's offer fell from $840 million initially to $733 million. ''If we don't sell it, it's positive, and if we sell it, it's positive,'' said Patrick Ricard, the chairman of the Paris-based company, during a recent interview in New York.
2000-01-19	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Coca-Cola Sets Out to Be a Friendlier, More Adaptable Company	IN what amounts to a rare admission of failure, the Coca-Cola Company is trying to make itself into a friendlier company that will adapt more to local markets around the world. The new strategy, emerging from Coca-Cola's recent announcements and from conversations with people close to the company, involves a string of personnel moves and related actions. They are intended to improve the company's standing on Wall Street and repair its reputation with consumers, regulators, bottlers and others with whom its relationships have been damaged over the last two years.
2000-01-13	A revamped pitch for Coke will pave the way for higher prices.	IT would be an exaggeration to assert that a new campaign for the flagship soft drink sold by the Coca-Cola Company is a make-or-break effort. After all, the beverage, known as Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola elsewhere, is the world's best-selling soda and most recognized brand. Yet the television, print and Internet campaign, the first revamping of the venerable product's pitch in almost seven years, is being introduced at a crucial time for the company. Coca-Cola is facing what could be its toughest marketing battle in recent memory as it seeks to persuade American customers to pay more for soft drinks.
2000-01-08	Coca-Cola Again Shuffles Its Managers	In its second round of major changes this week, Coca-Cola announced yesterday that its chief marketing officer, Charles S. Frenette, would become president of its troubled European operations. His replacement is a veteran of Coke's business in Japan, long the biggest single profit source for the company. On Tuesday, Carl H. Ware, Coke's highest-ranking black executive, who said in November that he would step down later this year, was named executive vice president for corporate affairs and government relations. Mr. Ware's departure plans, disclosed after a management shuffle that effectively demoted him, had caused concern within Atlanta's civil rights community and among some investors, particularly since the company is facing a racial-discrimination lawsuit filed by eight of its black employees.
1999-12-29	CHILEAN BEVERAGE MARKET	Chile's top beverage company, Cervecerias Unidas S.A., said the Coca-Cola Company was trying to corner the beverage market in Chile by canceling its contract to sell Crush and Canada Dry brand drinks. Cervecerias will appeal to the antimonopoly regulator to block Coca-Cola from prematurely ending the contract in February after saying on Monday that it planned to take legal action. The brands account for $42 million in sales, a quarter of the Cervecerias soft-drink revenue. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, declined to comment.
1999-12-19	The Real Thing	Instead of properties, there are old-time soda bottles and nostalgic ads. Instead of houses, there are six-packs. The big money is in vending machines, not hotels. It's Coca-Cola Monopoly, a custom version of the familiar board game with brand imagery everywhere, from the playing pieces (a Coke truck, a bottle cap) to the board and the play money. It is available in some stores and is officially for anyone 8 and over.
1999-12-18	Coke Bottler In Italy Fined $16 Million	In the latest blow to the world's best-known brand, Italian regulators fined the bottler for the Coca-Cola Company in Italy more than $16 million yesterday after finding that the bottler had engaged in unfair practices. The fine amounts to about 3 percent of sales in Italy this year but is less than half the maximum penalty. It will be paid by Coca-Cola, which owns 51 percent of the bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages. The bottler was also ordered to end some discounts in its exclusive contracts with supermarkets, a move that could curb its business.
1999-12-12	Cola Makers Leave Their Bottlers Flat	COCA-COLA, the soft drink, is based on a closely guarded secret formula. But the arithmetic that results when Coca-Cola, the company, decides to squeeze more profit from its complex relationships with its bottlers was laid bare last week. On Friday, shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, in which Coca-Cola holds a 39 percent stake, closed at $18.375, less than half their 52-week high of $37.50. The share price of Coca-Cola Consolidated, the No. 2 Coke bottler in the United States, closed at $49.75, down 13.5 percent for the year.
1999-12-10	New Coca-Cola Chief Says He Plans No Abrupt Change	Three days after his surprising selection as the next chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, Douglas N. Daft got on the telephone with reporters yesterday and talked about, among other things, his feelings upon being asked to take the lead. ''They've tended to range from shock to surprise to sorrow to elation,'' Mr. Daft said. And then there is pride, he added, ''pride in the company and pride in being asked to take this position.''
1999-12-10	When the Customers Won't Pay More, the Chief Departs	DO you remember what a two-liter bottle of Coke cost 5 or 10 years ago? Have prices gone up? The answers to those questions go a long way toward explaining why M. Douglas Ivester is leaving his job after little more than two years as Coca-Cola's chief executive. It's hard to sustain the stock price of a growth company when the company can't raise prices.
1999-12-04	As Coke Regains European Sales, Parents Say 4 Children Are Still Ill	There were roadshows and beach parties, rock concerts and free handouts to refurbish the European image of Coca-Cola, the world's most famous brand. Yet, five months after 250 people in Belgium complained of sickness they attributed to contaminated soft drinks, prompting the biggest recall in Coke's 113-year history, a number of obstacles are frustrating the company's effort to put the scandal to rest. Coca-Cola's sales have sharply increased and it has achieved what a spokesman, Steve Leroy, called a ''significant success'' in recovering its dominant market share. But Coke's competitors have taken umbrage at its giveaways, forcing the Atlanta-based beverage giant, through a court ruling this week, to suspend the free products it has been offering to 40,000 outlets in Belgium.
1999-11-30	Coke Promotion Is Halted	Coca-Cola said today that it would end a promotion in Belgium after a court ruled the company had abused its position as that nation's largest maker of soft drinks. Coke said it would appeal the decision by the Brussels Commercial Court, though it will comply.
1999-11-29	Now, Brought to You by Coke (or Pepsi): Your City Hall	Beachgoers who become thirsty while strolling on this surfing town's pier had better like Coke. Every vending machine on and around the pier offers only Coca-Cola beverages. The selection is just as limited in the city's parks and civic center. As on all municipal property here, there is little evidence that Pepsi, Coke's main competitor, even exists.
1999-11-25	France Again Rejects Coke Orangina Bid	After a two-year struggle with French regulators, the Coca-Cola Company was rejected yesterday for a second time in its bid to buy the Orangina soft drink brand from Pernod Ricard S.A., and a spokesman for Coca-Cola said the company regarded the decision as final. The announcement from the French government came as a surprise because Coca-Cola had carefully reconstructed its original offer to satisfy officials of the competition council, who had turned the deal down in September of last year. The government's concern was that if Coke bought Orangina, it would control too much of the distribution network in France that other soft drink makers use. Among the companies that might have been affected was PepsiCo, which had lodged a complaint with the government.
1999-11-20	COCA-COLA ORDERED TO PRODUCE DATA IN LAWSUIT	The Coca-Cola Company was ordered yesterday to produce ''any nonprivileged computerized or hard copy data'' concerning race and employment procedures by Dec. 16 to plaintiffs' lawyers in a racial discrimination suit brought by four former and current black employees. The order came in federal court in Atlanta, where United States Magistrate E. Clayton Scofield III was considering five motions -- four submitted by the plaintiffs and one by Coca-Cola -- concerning the discovery phase of the case. The employees are suing the company for discriminating against black employees in pay, promotions and evaluations.
1999-11-16	Coca-Cola Bottler Discusses Its Price Increase	Insisting that there had been no fundamental shift in strategy, the Coca-Cola Company's largest bottler told investors and money managers in a rare conference call yesterday that its decision to raise retail prices earlier this year should improve the company's cash flow and profitability despite a drop in volume. The increases in the United States and Canada by the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, were followed in recent weeks by an increase in concentrate prices by Coca-Cola. Both companies have said that a marketing campaign by Coca-Cola is supposed to persuade consumers to pay more for Coke products after years of low prices brought on by a price war with its rival, PepsiCo, and the emergence of private-label soft drinks.
1999-11-15	Biggest Coke Bottler to Discuss Its Pricing in Call Today	In a highly unusual move, Coca-Cola's largest bottler plans a telephone conference call with analysts and investors today that a spokeswoman said was intended to clarify questions about pricing and strategy that first attracted attention at a beverage conference in New York earlier this month. The bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, is under pressure from Wall Street. It has seen its stock battered -- especially since Nov. 3, when it said at the industry conference that the price it pays for the prime ingredients for soft drinks would rise at twice the usual rate next year.
1999-11-09	Black Executive's Departure to Complicate Coke's Diversity Drive	When Coca-Cola shuffled its senior management last month, Carl H. Ware, a senior vice president responsible for African business, was told he would no longer report to M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman and chief executive. Instead, Mr. Ware, the highest-ranking black at the company, was reassigned to Douglas N. Daft, another senior vice president whose portfolio before the announcement consisted of Coke's business in Asia and the Middle East.
1999-11-01	Coke's New Pricing	To the Editor: The Coca-Cola Company has brought forth a wonderful plan to vary the price of its product based on consumers' desire at that moment; Coke vending machines will be programmed to bump up the price of sodas when the weather is hot (Business Day, Oct. 28). I can see the day when the price of most products and services will go up or down according to ''spot demand.'' Imagine a surgeon setting his fee based on how badly the patient needs an operation, and once that deal is struck and the first cut is about to be made, the anesthesiologist can probably get whatever price he asks. DOUGLAS NEUMETZGER River Vale, N.J., Oct. 29, 1999
1999-10-31	Is a Cold Soda Worth More on a Hot Day?	To the Editor: The Coca-Cola Company's strategy of using vending machines that adjust prices upward as the temperature rises (Business Day, Oct. 28) flies in the face of creating product differentiation. It puts the emphasis on price competition with Pepsi and other soft drinks and defeats the whole purpose of creating special solutions to consumers' needs.
1999-10-31	Is a Cold Soda Worth More on a Hot Day?	To the Editor: If I ever encounter one of the Coca-Cola Company's new temperature-sensitive vending machines that raise prices in hot weather (Business Day, Oct. 28), I would approach it with ice cube in hand to place it against the sensor. When the price drops sufficiently because of my artificially induced climate, my demand will yield a reasonably priced supply. GORDON USTICKE Athens, N.Y., Oct. 28, 1999
1999-10-31	Is a Cold Soda Worth More on a Hot Day?	To the Editor: Before the Coca-Cola Company considers charging more for cold sodas on hot days (Business Day, Oct. 28), it should make absolutely sure that every soda that rolls out is ice cold, not room temperature. Or will the machines automatically refund my money when the Coke is warm? ANDREW MCDOUGAL Bryan, Tex., Oct. 28, 1999
1999-10-30	Coke Assigns Larger Roles To 3 Officers	Coca-Cola said yesterday that three top executives would assume greater authority, apparently setting up a succession contest for the top job and easing some criticism that the chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, lacked a second in command. The changes increase the responsibilities of two senior vice presidents, Jack L. Stahl and Douglas N. Daft, as well as those of the chief financial officer, James E. Chestnut.
1999-10-29	Corrections	An article in Business Day last Saturday about four children in Belgium who reported feeling ill after drinking Coca-Cola products misstated the site of a bottling plant where one product was produced. It is in East Kilbride, Scotland, not England.
1999-10-28	Variable-Price Coke Machine Being Tested	Taking full advantage of the law of supply and demand, the Coca-Cola Company has quietly begun testing a vending machine that can automatically raise prices for its drinks in hot weather. ''This technology is something the Coca-Cola Company has been looking at for more than a year,'' said Rob Baskin, a company spokesman, adding that it had not yet been placed in any consumer market.
1999-10-26	Coca-Cola Tests Find No Problem	The Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest soft-drink company, said today that its initial tests on drinks that Belgian schoolchildren said last week had made them sick indicated no problems with the beverages. Four Belgian teen-agers said they felt ill after drinking Coca-Cola and Fanta. The drinks were produced at two separate bottling plants in Belgium and Britain, the company said. Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, has not stopped producing the drinks.
1999-10-23	Four Children Report Illness From Coke Products	Four schoolchildren in Belgium said yesterday that they experienced nausea, headaches and rashes after drinking Coca-Cola products bought from a vending machine near their school. But a spokesman for the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta said the soft drinks were not the cause. ''We believe the Coca-Cola is perfectly normal and of high quality,'' said the spokesman, Randall W. Donaldson.
1999-10-22	Coca-Cola Earnings Slid 11.4% in Quarter	In a performance that indicated improving sales but not better profits, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings fell 11.4 percent but that revenue rose 9.4 percent. The company reported net income of $787 million, or 32 cents a diluted share, compared with $888 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. That quarter, plagued by volume declines stemming from the Russian economic crisis, continued sluggishness in Japan and other disappointments around the globe, was the start of a decline that the soft-drink giant has struggled to reverse.
1999-10-20	Chief at Coke Bottler Is Retiring, Three Months Ahead of Schedule	Surprising some analysts, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler for the Coca-Cola Company, announced yesterday that its chief executive, Henry A. Schimberg, would retire at the end of the year, three months earlier than expected. His replacement, for the moment, is the company's 67-year-old chairman. ''This is like Paul Harvey -- we're still waiting for the rest of the story,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a consumer products analyst for Merrill Lynch, who called the announcement ''a major surprise.'' He added, ''I'm not sure everyone is a happy camper about this one.''
1999-10-19	Coca-Cola will try to promote its top brand with more emotion.	THE Coca-Cola Company, the maker of the world's best-known brand, will soon be exhorting consumers to take what amounts to a magical mystery tour of the mouth by enjoying the ''unique taste sensation'' and ''sparkle on your tongue'' of its flagship product. Starting early next year, the company will promote its best-selling brand -- known as Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola elsewhere -- in more emotional, elemental ways intended to resonate with consumers who tell market researchers they value attributes like authenticity and optimism and have been eschewing colas in favor of beverages like water, juices and flavored teas.
1999-10-10	Tearing Down The Facade of 'Vitamins Inc.'	THE scope of the conspiracy boggles the mind. For a full decade, top executives at some of the world's largest drug companies met secretly in hotel suites and at conferences. When Federal investigators were closing in, they moved to the homes of high-level European executives. Working together in a coalition they brazenly called ''Vitamins Inc.,'' they carved up world markets and carefully orchestrated price increases, in the process defrauding some of the world's biggest food companies, including Kellogg, Coca-Cola and Nestle.
1999-10-07	Lawyers File Motion In Coke Bias Suit	Lawyers for four black employees at the Coca-Cola Company filed a motion yesterday that included invoices from a Staples store in Atlanta, showing that someone at Coke had ordered a shredding machine in late April, after a discrimination lawsuit was filed. Lawyers for the plaintiffs have accused the company of destroying documents that might be relevant to their suit.
1999-10-03	For Soft-Drink Makers, a Dry Spell	AS Coca-Cola's share price dropped below $48 in trading last week, from a high of over $88 last year, investors were wondering: Can it get any worse? It is pretty bad, and not just for Coke, whose recent track record was described last week as ''the most significant underperformance versus the S. & P. 500 in the history of the company'' by Andrew J. Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
1999-10-01	Coke in Move Against Bias Suit	Lawyers for the Coca-Cola Company asked a Federal judge yesterday to punish the lawyers for four black employees who filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against the company, saying the plaintiffs' lawyers had falsely accused the company of shredding documents related to the case. The plaintiffs' lawyers submitted a motion two weeks ago in which they cited testimony from several employees who said important documents were being destroyed by the company.
1999-09-17	Lawyers in Bias Suit Assert Coca-Cola Shredded Files	In documents filed late yesterday, the lawyers for four black employees of the Coca-Cola Company, who have filed a lawsuit accusing the company of discriminating against blacks in pay, promotions and performance evaluations, said they had evidence that Coca-Cola executives were shredding documents that might be relevant to the case. The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Cyrus Mehri, asked Federal District Judge Richard W. Story for sanctions against the company. He cited a June 23 letter from William A. Clineburg Jr., one of Coca-Cola's lawyers, denying the existence of shredders in a room being used to assemble documents for the company's defense. In the letter, Mr. Clineburg wrote, ''No data are being destroyed.''
1999-09-08	Pernod-Coke Hearing Set	Pernod Ricard S.A.'s planned sale of its Orangina beverage to the Coca-Cola Company will be examined by French competition officials at a Sept. 28 hearing, setting the stage for a final decision after almost two years of talks. A panel will oversee a private hearing with Coke and Pernod. Conclusions will be passed on to the Finance Minister, who rejected the deal last year on the ground that it would be adverse to competition. After failing to win approval for its first offer made in December 1997, Coke agreed this year to scale back its bid to 4.7 billion francs ($758 million) from 5 billion and not distribute the drink in French restaurants, cafes and hotels.
1999-09-04	Coca-Cola Offers Warning Of Weakness in Near Term	The Coca-Cola Company confirmed Wall Street's fears yesterday that near-term profits will suffer, as improving unit volume remains a challenge for the rest of this year. Citing the lingering impact of halted sales in parts of Europe this summer, as well as sluggishness in other markets like Latin America, Eastern Europe and China, the soft-drink company said unit case volume in the third quarter would increase only at a low single-digit rate.
1999-08-24	An Old-Fashioned Brawl Among Options Exchanges	Facing new challenges from electronic trading systems and regulatory inquiries into anticompetitive practices, the nation's leading options exchanges opted today for an old-fashioned market brawl. The Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock Exchange fired the opening salvo this morning by listing options of the Dell Computer Corporation, which for years had been traded exclusively on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The two won huge market share on the first day of trading.
1999-08-18	European Report Doubts Explanation by Coke	The Coca-Cola Company did not give credible explanations of how its drinks became contaminated in Belgium and France in June, the European Commission says in its first public assessment of the events that preceded the largest product recall in the company's history. ''Coca-Cola's explanations of how beverages at two separate plants in two different countries became contaminated and produced the same symptoms in about 250 consumers is highly implausible from a scientific point of view,'' the commission said in its report, which was released on Monday.
1999-08-13	Italian Inquiry's Report Will Fault Coke's Business Practices	After a 14-month investigation into the business practices of the Coca-Cola Company, Italian competition authorities will issue a report today that accuses the soft-drink giant of using its market dominance to try to drive out smaller competitors, including Pepsico Inc., its chief rival around the world. The report, a translated copy of which was provided to The New York Times, all but completes the investigation that resulted from complaints made in 1997 and last year by Pepsico, and an Italian supermarket chain called Esselunga S.p.A. A similar inquiry, led by officials of the European Union, is under way in Austria, Denmark and Germany. That investigation, which began July 20 with early-morning raids on Coke offices as well as the offices of its bottlers for those countries, was also prompted by complaints from Pepsico as well as other Coke rivals, including Virgin Cola.
1999-08-11	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Thursday about the soft-drink business of Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. misstated the percentage of Cadbury brands acquired by the Coca-Cola Company that would be handled at least temporarily by Pepsi-Cola bottlers as part of the deal. About 20 percent of the volume, not 60 percent, will be bottled by Pepsi.
1999-07-31	COCA-COLA COMPLETES PURCHASE OF CADBURY UNIT	The Coca-Cola Company yesterday completed the acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C.'s soda business in 155 countries for $700 million. Coca-Cola, the world's largest beverage company, also said its efforts to buy Cadbury's soda businesses in Australia, Mexico and Canada were continuing. Among the countries in which the acquisition closed were Brazil, Japan and Britain. In May, Coca-Cola bowed to European antitrust regulators and scaled down its proposed purchase, which includes the Cadbury's Dr Pepper, Crush and Canada Dry brands.
1999-07-29	CADBURY PROFITS INCREASE	Rising demand for Dr Pepper in the United States and stronger confectionary sales in Britain and Australia helped Cadbury Schweppes' earnings rise 4.4 percent in the first half of 1999, the company, a London-based maker of candy and soft drinks, reported. In a telephone interview, Cadbury's chief executive, John M. Sunderland, said the company's strategy -- to rid itself of most soft-drink operations in a $1.1 billion sale to the Coca-Cola Company in favor of becoming a bigger player in the candy business -- was unaffected by the drawn-out regulatory review of its deal with Coca-Cola. In several large markets, including Australia, Mexico and Canada, the deal has not been approved. Constance L. Hays (NYT)
1999-07-23	Pepsi Acknowledges Role in Putting Coca-Cola Under Inquiry	The European Commission's raid this week on Coca-Cola offices in four countries followed complaints from competitors, including Pepsico, that had accused Coke of unfair business practices intended to keep rival products off store shelves. Pepsico acknowledged yesterday that it had informed European Commission officials that it believed Coca-Cola was abusing its dominant position in the European market. The acknowledgment indicates that the cola wars have moved to a fresh international arena. While Pepsi executives had said they would not exploit Coke's problems that arose from a recall in Europe earlier this month, they appeared less constrained over Coke's already difficult relationship with the European Commission.
1999-07-22	Regulators Seize Documents From Coca-Cola in Europe	In the latest twist to the Coca-Cola Company's fortunes -- or misfortunes -- in Europe, its offices in four European countries have been raided by regulators who seized company documents that may lead to an investigation of the company's competitive practices with big customers like supermarkets. A spokesman for Coca-Cola confirmed yesterday that officials from the European Commission, which has tangled with Coke several times in recent months, appeared without warning as the business day was beginning Tuesday and asked for access to company files.
1999-07-16	Coca-Cola Earnings Fall 21%, Reflecting Troubles in Europe	In part because it had to pull millions of soft drinks off the market in Europe last month, the Coca-Cola Company's second-quarter profit fell 21 percent, the company said yesterday. In the quarter ended June 30, net income dropped to $942 million, or 38 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.19 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
1999-07-14	Coca-Cola Bottler Reports Surprisingly Big Slide in Sales	The Coca-Cola Company's major bottler in Central and Eastern Europe reported an unexpectedly steep drop in first-half volume sales yesterday and its stock fell sharply. The bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages, attributed the 5 percent decline in volume, measured in cases sold, to severe economic problems in Russia, the Kosovo conflict, the company's recent bottled-water recalls in Poland and bad publicity from Coca-Cola beverage recalls in Belgium and France, which were handled by a different bottler.
1999-07-13	Recall to Cost Coke Bottler $103 Million	Coca-Cola's bottler said yesterday that it would take a $103 million charge against second-quarter earnings to cover expenses associated with the recall of soft drinks in Europe last month, about 70 percent more than previously acknowledged. The bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, said two weeks ago that the recall involved 14 million cases of soft drinks and would cost the company $60 million. But that number ballooned to $103 million, or about 16 cents a diluted share, the company said, after 17 million cases of products were returned by people living in countries where Coke products were taken off the shelves in the biggest recall in Coca-Cola's 113-year history.
1999-07-09	Corrections	An article in Business Day on June 30 about Coca-Cola's handling of the recall of its beverages in Belgium and France last month misspelled the surname of Belgium's Health Minister. He is Luc Van den Bossche, not Van den Brossche.
1999-07-06	Fungicide Found on Coke Cans in Germany	Faint traces of fungicide have been found on five cans of Coca-Cola, the Agriculture Ministry in the southwestern German state of Baden-Wurttemberg said today. The ministry said the fungicide found on the cans was not a health hazard because of the small amount of concentration.
1999-07-04	The Way We Live Now: 7-4-99; Mad Coke Disease	John Lanchester article says recent contamination of Coca-Cola products in Belgium and France is feeding Europe's frenzy over such foodborne threats as Mad Cow Disease, dioxin in Belgian chicken and pork, hormones in American beef and genetically altered foods; says that these food scares may seem comical to Americans, who have far greater faith in modern agribusiness, science and Government, but that the humor could wear off once America has a real tainted-food scare of its own; photo (M)
1999-07-03	THE TAINTED TOUR: A special report.; Drug Scandals Dampen Cycling's Top Event	The Tour de France, one of Europe's legendary sporting events, will draw 180 of the finest bicycle riders in the world Saturday to a theme park in western France. From there, they will embark on the Tour's annual three-week race to Paris. In a typical year, an estimated 15 million people line the race route and another 160 million worldwide watch on television. And in a typical year, Daniel Baal would be among the most interested spectators. Baal is the president of the French Cycling Federation and a vice president of the International Cycling Union, which governs the sport worldwide. But Baal said he had been unable to watch a bicycle race this season.
1999-07-03	Coca-Cola Recalls Water in Poland After Bacteria Are Found	In its second beverage recall in Poland this week, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it was removing all half-liter bottles of its Bonaqua Plus purified water from stores because Polish Government scientists had detected coliform bacteria in the product. About 180,000 bottles of the water had already been distributed by the bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages, and were being pulled from the market, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman, Sonya Soutus, said. All of them will be destroyed, along with thousands more bottles that were in warehouses awaiting shipment, she said.
1999-07-02	Mold Scare in Poland Causes Another Coke Recall	Following the discovery of mold inside one batch of glass bottles earlier this week, the Coca-Cola Company is recalling all of its soft drinks in the same-sized bottles in Poland, the company said yesterday. The recall affects an estimated 170,000 cases of Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light, Fanta and Kinley tonic water, as well as Bonaqua mineral water, where the problem was originally noticed in 0.33 liter bottles.
1999-07-01	Coke Expects Sales to Decline 1% to 2%, Mainly in Europe	Citing the recall of its soft drinks in Europe last month -- the biggest in company history -- the Coca-Cola Company estimated yesterday that its beverage sales fell 1 percent to 2 percent in the second quarter compared with sales in the period a year earlier. Sales in the company's European division, which includes Belgium, France and other countries where Coke was ordered off store shelves after a contamination scare, are expected to fall 6 percent to 7 percent, the largest drop in any of Coke's six global divisions.
1999-06-30	'Family Guy' Loses Sponsors	Fox's new animated show ''Family Guy,'' which had the makings of a new hit during its run on the air this spring, is in trouble with a list of important advertisers, some of which have already pulled commercials from the series. The advertisers, which include Coca-Cola and Philip Morris, had each received strongly worded letters as part of a letter-writing campaign directed by a Connecticut school headmaster who complains that the show includes what he describes as anti-Semitic, racist and sexist humor. Executives at Coca-Cola and Philip-Morris, however, said that they dropped out as sponsors based on their own review of its content.
1999-06-30	A Sputter in the Coke Machine; When Its Customers Fell Ill, a Master Marketer Faltered	As the Coca-Cola Company tries to regain its footing in Europe after a contamination scare that caused the biggest product recall in the company's 113-year history, executives have made a rare admission: mistakes were made in manufacturing. Such humility is far from routine for the soft-drink giant, renowned as it is for superb marketing and a corporate structure that is well oiled from top to bottom. But the crisis in Europe, in which hundreds of people said they felt sick after drinking Cokes, has revealed a different Coca-Cola, one that stumbled repeatedly, making an unfortunate situation even worse.
1999-06-29	Coke Scare Was Preceded By a May Case	Almost four weeks before the Coca-Cola Company publicly acknowledged the contamination in Belgium that led to the biggest recall in its 113-year history, four people had become sick at a bar near Antwerp and blamed drinking Coke for their illnesses, a senior Belgian health ministry official said today. The first the public in general knew of the scare, which eventually led to a total 10-day ban on Coca-Cola products in Belgium and spread alarms across Europe, was on June 8 after more than 30 teen-age school-children in the town of Bornem were taken to the hospital complaining of stomachaches, dizziness and nausea.
1999-06-27	The World; Coca-Cola Hopes Things Go Better With 'Sorry'	UNLIKE love, being in business sometimes means having to say you're sorry. Last week, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company issued one of the more elaborate public apologies by an American business leader. In newspaper ads in Belgium Tuesday that followed an outright ban on the company's products after reports of people becoming sick, M. Douglas Ivester said ''I'm sorry'' or ''we regret'' or ''I apologize'' five times. The ban, which began on June 14 and spread to France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands a day later in varying degrees, turned into the largest recall of Coke products in history and created a public-relations mess for the company. Mr. Ivester's apology in the newspaper was the second issued in less than a week.
1999-06-25	Coke Bottling Site in France Is Given Clean Bill of Health	The French authorities lifted a ban today on canned Coca-Cola soft drinks produced at a bottling plant here, saying they had found no evidence of contamination to explain an outbreak of nausea by people who drank them in Belgium early this month. Officials at Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling company that is about 40 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, said the ensuing health scare, and bans on Coke products in France and Belgium, would reduce the bottling company's earnings by $60 million in the second quarter of this year.
1999-06-25	Coca-Cola Acts Slowly but Credibly	Big international companies often seem to be operating on autopilot, and are therefore slow to sense when something has gone badly wrong that threatens not only immediate losses but the company's reputation, which is a brand-name company's most important asset. Coca-Cola, the most recent company to face such a problem, reacted slowly but adequately to a crisis that erupted in Europe when -- by the company's account -- unrelated problems at two plants produced sodas that smelled and tasted terrible. Doctors say the numerous reports of illness may have had more to do with mass hysteria than with the defects in the products.
1999-06-25	The Coke Stomach Ache Heard Round the World	Sixteen days ago, Sasha Cockx bought his midday Coke at the School of St. Mary and flipped back the bottle cap to collect the token underneath. Collecting 500 points -- one from each small bottle, three from a large one -- could produce a cellular telephone for only about $75, the 14-year-old scholar said. It is a prize he is not likely to collect. An hour after he drank the Coke, his head began to ache and his stomach hurt. His friend Timothy Alen, who drank two Cokes, even though both he and Mr. Cockx said they thought the soda had smelled strange, said his knees started to tremble and he felt nauseated.
1999-06-24	Belgium Lightens Coca-Cola's Problems, but Questions Persist	The Belgian health authorities ended a 10-day ban today on products of the Coca-Cola Company, permitting it to resume production in Belgium of sodas that were blamed for 249 cases of vomiting, cramps and other illnesses that shattered European confidence in the world's best-known brand. Coca-Cola welcomed the relaxation, promised a Coke giveaway here in coming days, offered to pay the medical costs of anyone who became ill and reiterated the company's contention that its sodas are safe. But in a continent riven by scares over the safety of supermarket products ranging from genetically modified soybeans to contaminated chicken, it remained doubtful that the heavyweight public relations campaign by the company and its chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, had stilled Europe's mistrust. The Belgian authorities said they still had not determined the exact cause of the sickness that led to the biggest recall in Coca-Cola's 113-year history.
1999-06-23	Mixed Day for Coca-Cola in European Illness Scare	The European crisis for Coca-Cola began to ease in France today, but the 15-nation European Union announced plans to carry out health inspections of its own in plants in Belgium and France that had produced soft drinks blamed for outbreaks of illness early this month. While the French ban on Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light, Fanta and Sprite canned by a Coca-Cola factory in Dunkirk, France, could be lifted as early as Wednesday, Pietro Petrucci, a European Union spokesman, said European inspectors would visit that plant and one in Antwerp, Belgium, and might not finish their report until next week.
1999-06-22	Coca-Cola Chairman Uses Ads to Apologize to Belgians	The chairman of the Coca-Cola Company apologized to the people of Belgium in extraordinarily contrite newspaper ads today over a contamination scare that began there more than a week ago and spread to other countries in Europe. But he stopped short of conceding that Coca-Cola products made anyone sick, and a study released by the company suggested something else had caused their symptoms. ''To those people who suffered, especially the children, my colleagues and I want to express a very sincere apology,'' the chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, said in the ads, printed in Flemish and French. ''We strive to make sure that Coca-Cola always stands for good feelings, and we regret that it instead resulted in feelings of illness.''
1999-06-19	Concern About Coke Products Spreads to Spain and Germany	As health concerns about Coca-Cola products spread to Spain and Germany, the company's top executive flew to Brussels yesterday to try to solve the growing public relations problem that began a week ago when Belgians fell ill after drinking Coke. M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, arrived in the Belgian capital to assure the public and Government officials that Coke's products were safe to drink. But the company is being criticized as slow to respond to a crisis, one that increasingly appears to be born of panic rather than reports of serious illness. At risk is the reputation of the world's best-known brand.
1999-06-18	Belgium Ends Ban on Some Coke Drinks	The Belgian Government said today that it was dropping its nationwide ban on some drinks produced by the Coca-Cola Company but keeping the ban on Coke, Fanta and Sprite pending further investigation into what caused dozens of Coke drinkers to fall ill. The decision was a blow to Coca-Cola, which had been hoping that a lifting of the ban would lead to restoration of European consumers' confidence in its products. That confidence has been hurt by the health scare involving Coke in four European countries.
1999-06-17	Coke's Chief Apologizes for Response on Contamination	Coca-Cola's top executive apologized to European customers today in response to a growing public outcry over its slow response to a soft-drink contamination that apparently made hundreds of people sick in Belgium. The apology by M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, the world's leading soft-drink company, came as French Government officials said that 80 people there had complained about nausea, fever and headaches. French stores removed more than 50 million bottles and cans from shelves today, and bans on the sale of Coca-Cola products remained in force for a second day in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
1999-06-16	In a Crisis, Coke Tries to Be Reassuring	Corporate executives live in fear of what happened to the Coca-Cola Company. Following reports that scores of Belgian children fell ill after drinking the company's trademark beverage, the Governments of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands ordered bans on Coke products. The Government decisions -- and the resulting concern by consumers over the safety of the company's soft drinks -- create a significant public relations challenge for the company, according to management professors and consultants. Coca-Cola has issued a statement assuring consumers that there are ''no health or safety issues'' concerning its products, but the outside experts say the company's reputation remains at risk.
1999-06-16	Coke Products Are Ordered Off the Shelves in Four Countries	In the biggest recall in Coke history, the Governments of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have ordered products from the Coca-Cola Company off their shelves after dozens of people who drank the soft drinks became ill. The move comes on the heels of a health scare over food contaminated with dioxin that began in Belgium and spread across Europe. On Sunday, the reverberations from the dioxin scare led to the resignation of the Belgian Prime Minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene.
1999-06-12	COCA-COLA BUYS FRANCHISEE	Coca-Cola said it had bought out its Singapore-based franchisee for seven Asian countries in exchange for shares of Australia's Coca-Cola Amatil valued at $271.3 million. It is buying the stake in the franchisee, F&N Coca-Cola, from Fraser & Neave. With the sale, Coke gets control of its franchises in Brunei, Cambodia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Vietnam.
1999-06-09	SODA DEAL IS BLOCKED	In the latest blow to the Coca-Cola Company's proposed $1.1 billion purchase of soft- drink brands from Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C., maker of Dr Pepper and Crush, Australian regulators denied approval of a revised plan that also involved the sale of some local Coke brands to Cadbury. Regulatory resistance has caused many European countries to be dropped from the deal, which does have approval in Britain.
1999-05-27	Naya learns the hard way the downside of relying on Coca-Cola Enterprises as its main distributor.	NAYA INC., a Canadian bottled-water company that has watched its sales surge in the last five years, now finds itself paddling hard. Naya has been a success story. It had a trendy product -- bottled water in small containers is the fastest-growing beverage in the United States -- a snappy advertising slogan (''hungry for life, thirsty for Naya'') and about 65 percent of its volume was distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises, one of the most powerful networks in the world.
1999-05-27	Coca-Cola Diversity Group	The Coca-Cola Company, the world's biggest beverage company, said today that it had formed a council to advise its chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, on racial diversity, after the company was sued for discrimination. Jack Stahl, president of Coca-Colae's North America division, and Carl Ware, a senior vice president who oversees the company's African operations and is its highest-ranking black employee, will lead the council, according to an internal memo. Coca-Cola confirmed the memo, though it declined to comment.
1999-05-25	Coke Pursues Scaled-Down Cadbury Deal	In the face of resistance from regulators around the world, the Coca-Cola Company scaled back its agreement yesterday to buy the soft-drink brands of Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. The companies had announced a $1.85 billion deal in December in which Coca-Cola agreed to buy Cadbury's brands worldwide, but regulators in Australia, Mexico, Belgium and the European Union have rejected or expressed concern in recent weeks about the purchase, usually because of the increased market dominance it would give Coca-Cola.
1999-05-24	Coca-Cola's former advertising philosopher sees the end of marketing as he knows it.	CONSUMERS might not have guessed, but the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, had a profound effect on the marketing of Coca-Cola in the days that followed. Furthermore, New Coke was not the total disaster it has been made out to be.
1999-05-21	Today's Lesson: Soda Rights; Consultant Helps Schools Sell Themselves to Vendors	Dan DeRose, marketing consultant, was busy doing the math for his new client, the Newark Public Schools. The question on everyone's mind: how much money could the district make if it sold a soft-drink company the exclusive right to vend its products on school grounds? The answer, according to Mr. DeRose: a lot more than it gets right now.
1999-05-20	Distributor Settles Fraud Case Against Coca-Cola Enterprises	A Maryland soft-drink distributor that sued Coca-Cola Enterprises in Federal court, accusing the bottler of fraud, wiretapping and other tactics intended to drive the distributor out of business, has agreed to drop the charges and settle its case. Laura Asman, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Coca-Cola Company's largest bottler, said the settlement terms, completed Friday, were ''strictly confidential.'' But as part of the settlement, the distributor, B. K. Miller of Clinton, Md., ''has sold its Coca-Cola assets to Coca-Cola Enterprises and will no longer be handling products of the Coca-Cola Company,'' she said.
1999-05-19	Pulp Friction	Coke promotes its ''secret formula'' for achieving uniformity of taste from Tulsa to Timbuktu. Pepsi scoffs, saying its product is just plain better and boasting that its market appeal gives it a big advantage over its archrival. Nothing new in any of that -- except that the soft-drink giants are both talking about orange juice.
1999-05-14	Cadbury and Coca-Cola Said to Discuss Deal	A senior Cadbury Schweppes executive said yesterday that the company planned to sell its brands in France to the Coca-Cola Company after Coca-Cola completed its negotiations with the French Government over the purchase of the Orangina soft-drink brand. Speaking to reporters in New York at a beverage industry conference, John F. Brock, Cadbury's global managing director for beverages, said, ''Once Orangina is resolved, we will sit down and negotiate an arrangement with Coke for France.''
1999-05-06	Corrections	Because of an editing error, the Market Place column in Business Day yesterday, about the Coca-Cola Company's bottling network, misstated the year in which Coca-Cola Enterprises was spun off. It was 1986, not 1996.
1999-05-05	THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Once-Sweet Bottling Plan Turns Sour for Coke	M. Douglas Ivester, the mastermind of Coca-Cola's worldwide bottling network, stood by like a proud uncle through most of the 1990's as the company racked up impressive gains in sales and profits. ''This company and this system have never been better equipped or better aligned than they are today,'' Mr. Ivester, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, said nearly a year ago.
1999-05-04	Coca-Cola Said to Renew French Talks	The Coca-Cola Company has reopened talks with the French Finance Ministry about its plan to buy the Orangina brand from Pernod-Ricard S.A., according to a report today in The Times of London. On April 9, the State Council, France's highest judicial authority, upheld the Government's veto of Coca-Cola's planned $825 million acquisition of Orangina.
1999-04-23	Blacks, Citing Bias at Work, Sue Coca-Cola	A group of black employees filed a class-action lawsuit today accusing the Coca-Cola Company of discriminating against African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. The lawsuit was filed in United States District Court in Atlanta by four past and current employees ranging from a security guard to a former executive who earned nearly $100,000 a year. But the complaint said the four brought the action on behalf of as many as 1,500 black employees who work or have had salaried positions at Coca-Cola throughout the United States since April 1985.
1999-04-22	Coca-Cola Posts 13% Drop In First-Quarter Net Income	Continuing a recent pattern of weak results, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its first-quarter net income fell 13 percent as the company struggled to expand its business. The amount of Coke concentrate sold worldwide declined 1 percent, as did revenues, the company said. But expenses rose 5 percent, to $1.953 billion, from $1.857 billion in the first quarter of 1998, diminishing earnings, which were $747 million, or 30 cents a share, down from $857 million, or 34 cents, in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
1999-04-21	Coca-Cola Enterprises Reports Lackluster Sales	Reporting sales that were weaker than expected, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Coca-Cola Company's largest soft-drink bottler, said yesterday that first-quarter volume rose just 1 percent, one of the smallest increases in years. Fountain volume -- the soft drinks sold in restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas and other public places -- grew just 2 percent in the quarter. Despite the unimpressive volume growth, Coca-Cola Enterprises said cash flow rose 11 percent, to $417 million in the quarter, after the company raised prices in several distribution channels, including many supermarkets. Net losses, however, widened to $61 million; in the comparable quarter of 1998, the company lost $51 million. Revenues per case increased 3 percent in the quarter, reflecting the higher prices as well as product, packaging and distribution changes.
1999-04-21	Neat Place, but Where's the Cafe, and What's That Smell?	IN the same elegant Paris district as the Musee d'Orsay, the Impressionist art museum that was once a railroad terminal, a guide at another museum was standing in front of a display of a stuffed rat the size of a rabbit. ''We don't want to eliminate all the rats,'' she explained in a cheerful French accent, ''because they eat three times their weight in waste.'' We were in the Paris sewer museum -- one museum that does not have a cafe. It does have a gift shop, though, and I cherish the postcards that I bought showing sewer entrances, early photographs of tourists riding through a watery sewer tunnel and a full-color portrait called ''Rat in a Sewer.''
1999-04-15	To increase sales, Burger King plans an image-building overhaul of its 10,000 restaurants.	MOVING to improve its image, food and sales, Burger King said yesterday that it would overhaul its 10,000 restaurants with new kitchens, modifications to drive-through windows and elaborate redesigns of the buildings and the company logo. The flame-broiled concept will remain, but customers can say goodbye to those boxy structures huddling in the middle of the shopping mall or along the interstate that have long meant Burger King. The new restaurants are supposed to be elongated statements with intersecting jutting planes and a fast-food interpretation of a clerestory window. Inside, the kitchen will permit views of the cooking process, flames and all. A children's playground is also part of the plan. The prototype, built in a hurry in Reno, is scheduled to open tomorrow.
1999-03-31	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Pepsi Bottling is a giant offering that could well fail to excite investors fixated on Internet stocks.	IN another environment, the initial public offering of the Pepsi Bottling Group might be one of the hottest stock deals of the year, driven by an international brand name and a consumer franchise with great opportunity to expand abroad. But in the year of the Internet, investors have been rather uninterested in offerings by companies lacking ''dot-com'' in their names.
1999-03-17	$1.2 Billion Bill at Coke Raises Eyebrows	In 1998, a grim year for the Coca-Cola Company, one bright spot was the United States, where case volume sales rose a healthy 6 percent. But that appears to have come at a high price. In its annual report, distributed last week, Coca-Cola disclosed that it spent more than $1.2 billion on marketing and on sales-related equipment for its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, which handles the bulk of Coca-Cola's volume in the United States in addition to sales in several countries in Western Europe. Coca-Cola controls about 42 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises, which was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company in 1986.
1999-03-02	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES ADDING 2 FRENCH BOTTLERS	Coca-Cola Enterprises said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire two privately owned Coca-Cola bottling operations in southern France for about $100 million. Together, the companies had net operating revenue of $70 million in 1998. One, Sud Boissons S.A., operates around the city of Toulouse, and the other, Societe Boissons Gazeuses de la Cote d'Azur, covers the areas around Nice and Cannes. Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta, is the world's largest bottler of soft drinks. If the deal closes as expected in the spring, the company will have bottling rights for all of France except Corsica.
1999-03-02	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Worldwide, Things Are Not Going Better for Coke	In a speech in Chicago last week, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company made references to several well-known films, including ''Being There'' and ''From Here to Eternity,'' when describing his company's experience overseas. He left out ''Suddenly, Last Summer.''
1999-02-24	COCA-COLA AGREES TO BUY HALF OF INCA KOLA PERU	The Coca-Cola Company has agreed to buy half of Inca Kola Peru S.A., its leading rival in Peru, and intends to market Inca Kola internationally. The transaction could cost Coke up to $200 million and represents another step in its effort to expand by buying powerful local brands, like Orangina, which it is trying to buy from Pernod Ricard. The bubble-gum-flavored Inca Kola is the most popular soft drink in Peru, and its maker has said that it wants to take it international, a move made easier with Coke as a partner. Coke also agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in Jose R. Lindley e Hijos S.A., the Inca Kola bottler.
1999-02-21	Private Sector; A Friendship Gone Flat	It's a small world after all. After a lawsuit by a Maryland distributor against Coca-Cola Enterprises -- accusing it of unfair pricing moves, fraud and other offenses -- was publicized last month, the bottler enlisted John H. Downs Jr., a 12-year veteran of its public affairs office, to answer questions from the news media. As it turns out, Mr. Downs and the plaintiff, the B. K. Miller Company, go back a way. Mr. Downs's father was a county official from Anne Arundel County, Md., where B. K. Miller is based, and David Miller, B. K. Miller's president, said his family and the Downses had known each other for years. He said his brother, Thomas V. Miller, the company's lawyer and the president of the Maryland Senate, had been especially friendly with Mr. Downs. Before filing his lawsuit, he added, he called Mr. Downs to see if things could be worked out. Mr. Downs told him that he ''didn't have much to do with sales,'' Mr. Miller said. ''So when he re-emerges as their spokesman, this public relations expert who dogs me in the press, that was disconcerting to me.''
1999-02-20	SALE OF A BOTTLED WATER CALLED DASANI IS SET	The Coca-Cola Company said it would begin selling a bottled water called Dasani in the United States and Canada this summer, tapping into the fastest-growing segment of the beverage industry. Dasani, a purified, noncarbonated water with minerals added, will be sold in light blue bottles in 20-ounce, 1-liter and 1.5-liter sizes. It will reach store shelves by June. Bottled water sales increased 9.8 percent in 1998, to $4.3 billion, according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a New York-based beverage consulting firm. Sales of bottled water in single-serve bottles grew at more than three times that rate last year.
1999-02-13	Coke Expands Its Lead in U.S.	The Coca-Cola Company widened its United States market lead over Pepsico Inc. in 1998, a report said, as sales of Coke's Sprite rose three times the rate of sales growth in the overall soft drink industry. Coca-Cola's share of the estimated $56.3 billion United States soft drink market increased by six-tenths of a percentage point, according to a survey by the industry publication Beverage Digest, which is based in Bedford Hills, and John C. Maxwell Jr., an analyst at Davenport & Company. Pepsico's share rose five-tenths of a percentage point.
1999-02-02	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Jan. 27 about the Coca-Cola Company's fourth-quarter earnings misstated the worldwide percentage increase in its soft-drink sales by volume last year. It was 6 percent, not 3.
1999-01-28	2 Coke Bottlers In Japan Link	The Coca-Cola Company has taken another step in its push to consolidate bottling operations in its second-most-profitable market, with two Japanese bottlers saying they will cooperate on production as the soft-drink maker moves to cut costs. The Kinki Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Osaka, Japan's largest Coke bottler, will jointly make soft drinks with the Chukyo Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Nagoya, the seventh-largest bottler, from July 1, the two companies said. The companies will at the same time ask the Mikasa Coca-Cola Bottling Company of the Nara prefecture in western Japan, to join the alliance. Eiji Yamashita, a Kinki spokesman, said a merger among the three companies is a possibility, but there are no plans to do so at this point.
1999-01-27	As Expected, Coca-Cola Reports a Weakened 4th Quarter	Confirming the bad news it had warned Wall Street about last month, the Coca-Cola Company reported its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, which showed that the global soft-drink giant suffered significant declines in volume and revenue in many parts of the world. Even though much of the damage had been expected, Wall Street seemed unsettled by the details. Shares of Coca-Cola fell 37.5 cents, to $62.5625, after losing about 3.5 percent at one point during the day.
1999-01-26	Pepsico's latest strategic move in a continuing effort to be a true challenger to Coca-Cola.	OVER the last year, Pepsico has been engaged in an intense campaign to transform its public image from perennial second-place finisher to a true challenger to the Coca-Cola Company. There have been changes in marketing, personnel and corporate structure. And, confirming what analysts had expected for months, Pepsico announced late yesterday that it was transferring several of its company-owned bottling franchises to the Whitman Corporation, the publicly traded owner of Pepsi's second-largest bottler.
1999-01-25	Cross-Media Deals Mean Bonanzas for Publishers	The best publicity a publisher couldn't buy is airing reliably on the nightly news. This month, it was a warm feature on NBC News about a World War II veteran and prisoner of war, a profile drawn from the pages of the NBC anchor Tom Brokaw's best-selling book ''The Greatest Generation.'' Then there is the story of a pioneering female military pilot, a profile in the same book and available for reading on MSNBC's Web site, which provides helpful links to the book's publisher, Random House. On a competing network, the ABC News anchor Peter Jennings is broadcasting weekly segments about the century, a theme familiar to readers of his lavishly illustrated best seller, ''The Century,'' which also has a computer link between the ABC Web site and Random House, the parent of the book's publisher, Doubleday. Still to come: a 12-part ABC Century documentary and a 15-hour History Channel series.
1999-01-22	A Ruling Favors Bottler of Coke	A Federal judge yesterday denied a Maryland soft-drink distributor's request for sanctions against Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the Coca-Cola Company's largest bottler, in connection with documents the bottler filed in a lawsuit. The judge ruled that a jury would have to determine whether the documents were fabricated, as lawyers for the distributor, B. K. Miller of Clinton, Md., have contended.
1999-01-21	When Your Bottler Is Your Rival; Vending-Machine Owners Ask Whose Side Coke Is On	One morning in October, Mike McGee stopped to inspect the Coca-Cola vending machines that he had installed in a new student recreation center at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif. To his dismay, he found a brand-new one standing there, too -- a machine installed by Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's biggest Coke bottler and the supplier to the $5-million-a-year McGee & Sons family business. And the rival machine was charging 45 cents for a 12-ounce can of Coke -- 10 cents cheaper than what Mr. McGee was charging.
1999-01-20	Coca-Cola Bottler Reports Wider Loss	Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the world's largest soft-drink bottler, said today that its loss widened in the fourth quarter, mostly because it increased spending on vending machines and coolers in an effort to spur sales. The bottling concern, which is 42 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, last year announced a plan to spend $5 billion over three years to buy trucks, vending machines and coolers. That depressed earnings in 1998 and is expected to hurt earnings this year but could result in large gains in 2000 and 2001, analysts said.
1999-01-15	COKE BOTTLERS IN JAPAN BEGIN CONSOLIDATION	One of Japan's largest Coca-Cola bottlers bought another bottler for 78 billion yen ($692 million) yesterday in a transaction brokered by the Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta. It sets the stage for consolidation of that nation's soft-drink industry. The deal was first reported in The Wall Street Journal. Coca-Cola, the world's biggest soft-drink company, will pay about $95 million for a 5 percent stake in a new Japanese bottling company created through the acquisition by Kita Kyushu Coca-Cola Company of the Sanyo Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola is now negotiating agreements with Japan's 15 other Coke bottlers to strengthen its position in Japan, said Roi Suzuki, the executive vice president of the Coca-Cola Japan Company.
1999-01-14	Next, the Drink 'n' Read	HAVE you seen them?'' asked Carole Baron, the president and publisher of Dell Publishing and Delacorte Press. ''They're cute.'' Indeed they are. Cute was exactly the word that came to mind when I first set eyes on the six little books that, beginning in February, will be distributed on supermarket shelves, tucked inside some 40 million 12- and 24-packs of Diet Coke.
1999-01-07	Distributor Accuses Coca-Cola Enterprises of Fraud	In court papers disclosed this week, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the world's largest Coca-Cola bottler, is accused of engaging in fraud, wiretapping and other tactics in an effort to drive a small Maryland soft-drink distributor out of business. In an amended version of its original lawsuit, the distributor, B. K. Miller of Clinton, Md., contends, among other things, that lawyers for Coca-Cola Enterprises submitted false reports to a Federal court from a private investigation company in an attempt to prove that B. K. Miller had illegally shipped Coke products outside its assigned sales territory.
1998-12-30	Diet Coke Shifts Duties To Wieden & Kennedy	In an advertising change involving its second-largest brand, the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta said yesterday that it would shift the lead creative duties on Diet Coke between roster agencies, moving the assignment to Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., from Lowe & Partners/ SMS in New York. Annual worldwide spending on the brand, sold in many countries as Coca-Cola Light, was estimated at $100 million. Consumers will see the initial results of the change on Monday, when a campaign by Wieden & Kennedy carrying the theme ''Live your life'' begins running on television. The campaign starts with two upbeat commercials about women and romance that focus on ''feeling good,'' said Jan Hall, global brand director for Diet Coke at Coca-Cola, rather than ''looking good,'' which has been a mainstay pitch for diet soft drinks.
1998-12-29	Bottler's Debt Refinanced	Pan-American Beverages Inc., the Latin American soft-drink bottler for the Coca-Cola Company, said yesterday that it had restructured $360 million in debt due in December and January. Pan-American, which is based in Mexico City, said the Coca-Cola Financial Corporation had extended it a new $200 million, three-year loan, replacing $200 million of short-term credit from banks. The remaining $160 million was rolled over by ING Bank and Bank of America for a three-month term.
1998-12-22	Corrections	The Advertising Column on Friday about a marketing battle between the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico in Venezuela misstated the country's area relative to Texas. Venezuela is 32 percent larger than Texas, not half the size.
1998-12-20	A New Chief Pushes to Restore a Soft-Drink Maverick's Lost Luster	FRANK E. WEISE 3D strode confidently to the podium. As chief executive of the Cott Corporation since June, Mr. Weise had ambitious long-term goals that he was eager to lay out for the audience of money managers and analysts at a beverage industry conference in New York last month. But before he could utter a word, almost everyone left the room.
1998-12-18	Coca-Cola is battling to consolidate its recent gains over Pepsico in a turf war in Venezuela.	THE heart of the affluent Las Mercedes neighborhood in Caracas, Venezuela, got a 150-foot artificial Christmas tree this year. The avenue around the tree was blocked off last month so that thousands of people from the Venezuelan capital could be brought in to watch Santa Claus arrive on a Coca-Cola truck, scattering souvenirs to all. ''For many of the kids and people from the barrios who don't have shoes or shirts in any kind of repair, it was the first time you'd seen them in this area,'' said Brent Willis, president of the Coca-Cola division that oversees Venezuela. ''When Santa Claus came in, they got to see the free celebration, and nothing comes for free to these guys.''
1998-12-12	Coke Warns of Poor Foreign Results as It Tells of Global Deal	The Coca-Cola Company disclosed yesterday that its fourth-quarter performance was proving even more dismal than the company had indicated a few weeks ago because of weakening markets abroad. But in an affirmation of its goal to gain more global power in the beverage industry, the company also announced a $1.85 billion purchase of overseas rights to the soft drinks of Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. At an abruptly scheduled meeting with securities analysts in New York, Coke officials said they expected that volume sales would rise 3 percent but that earnings would be 20 percent lower than originally estimated for the current quarter.
1998-12-11	Coca-Cola Abruptly Calls Analyst Meeting	The Coca-Cola Company summoned securities analysts last night for an early morning meeting in New York today with its chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester. The topic of the meeting was not disclosed, but analysts said it was described to them as a ''major strategic announcement.''
1998-11-15	How Much Soda Pop?	To the Editor: ''Global Crisis for Coca-Cola, or a Pause That Refreshes?'' (Nov. 1), looked at the management style of the company's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester. But it lacked any discussion of the health impact of the soda giant's products and marketing.
1998-11-01	Global Crisis for Coca-Cola, Or a Pause That Refreshes?	THE World of Coca-Cola, which on the cultural scale falls somewhere between legitimate museum and Disney-style extravaganza, is one of M. Douglas Ivester's hangouts. Once a month or so, he likes to pop in, gaze at the exhibits of Coke ephemera and eavesdrop on the tourists crowded around. The other day he spied a jukebox, punched up a bouncy 1930's tune, the ''Coca-Cola March,'' and lingered for a moment to listen. ''Doesn't it just make you want to get a flag and march,'' he asked, ''and then go attack the world?''
1998-10-16	Coca-Cola's Earnings Down By 12.2% in Third Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company reported third-quarter earnings yesterday that were in line with what the company previewed earlier this month, when senior executives warned that Coke's business had suffered from economic crises around the world. The company earned $888 million, or 36 cents a diluted share, down 12.2 percent from $1.011 billion, or 40 cents a share, last year. Revenue totaled $4.75 billion, down 4 percent from $4.95 billion.
1998-09-27	Maybe Pepsi Has a Job For a Dogged Coke Critic	Albert J. Meyer, a mild-mannered accountant, gained fame in 1995 for leading investigators to the New Era Philanthropy fraud in Philadelphia that cost investors of tens of millions of dollars. His doggedness in uncovering that scam helped win him a job at Martin Capital Management in Elkhart, Ind. But now, after Mr. Meyer, 47, used that same tenacity to go after the accounting methods of Coca-Cola, he and the small investment firm have agreed to part ways.
1998-09-26	Coke Expects Flat Earnings This Quarter	Painting a bleaker picture than many analysts had foreseen, the Coca-Cola Company disclosed yesterday that its short-term business results had been severely battered by global economic upheaval. In a statement after an early-morning meeting with Wall Street analysts in New York, the company warned that earnings would be flat in the third quarter, compared with the corresponding period last year, and would fall in the fourth quarter compared with last year. About two-thirds of Coke's earnings come from markets outside the United States.
1998-09-24	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Questions on Coca-Cola in Market Turmoil Abroad	Coca-Cola Company executives have summoned Wall Street analysts for a hastily scheduled meeting tomorrow morning in New York, suggesting that the leading soft-drink company is about to deliver ominous news about earnings. Coke derives most of its fortunes from overseas, where economic crises have ravaged the earnings of many American multinational companies.
1998-09-19	Diabetes and Soda	To the Editor: A Sept. 15 Science Times article on alternative healing mentions the high incidence of Type 2 diabetes among Mexican Indians and reports Dr. Helmut Wiedenfeld as saying that ''every village has a stand that sells sugary soft drinks.'' As a traveler in Mexico I found that the most predominant sugary soft drinks for sale in the most remote areas of Mexico are Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola products.
1998-09-18	France Blocks Coke's Bid For Orangina	The Coca-Cola Company's plan to take control of a leading French soft drink brand was blocked yesterday after the French Government rejected the acquisition, saying it would hurt consumers and give Coke too much dominance in the French market. Coke had announced the $840 million acquisition of the French brand Orangina, a unit of Pernod-Ricard S.A., in late December, and highlighted it in its annual report. The deal was one of the first major moves by M. Douglas Ivester, who became chief executive of Coca-Cola in October.
1998-08-25	Wendy's Says No to Pepsi, Yes to Coca-Cola	Wendy's International Inc. said today that it had renewed its soft-drink contract wih the Coca-Cola Company for 10 years and that it would force franchisees that served Pepsico Inc.'s drinks to switch to the other supplier once their agreements ended. The terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Coca-Cola will provide $100 million to Wendy's national advertising campaign during the next decade. Coca-Cola already provides soft drinks to about 4,400 of Wendy's 5,207 locations.
1998-08-14	Cola War II: The Bottler Battle; On Pepsi Front Line, It's Getting Dangerous to Go Solo	This is the capital of Pepsi country, where babies born at regional hospitals go home with Pepsi birth certificates, along with the state-issued ones. They grow up playing Pepsi-sponsored Little League and develop a taste for barbecue, hush puppies and one of the more unusual indigenous snacks: a package of salted peanuts poured directly into a bottle of Pepsi-Cola, to be drunk and chewed all at once. Pepsi signs dot the flat landscape of cornfields and tobacco farms, now shimmering in the summer heat. The minor-league Kinston Indians play their Class A home games beneath a big Pepsi scoreboard. Over the 63 years since the Pepsi-Cola bottling franchise was first awarded here, per capita consumption of Pepsi products, mostly Pepsi-Cola and Mountain Dew, has grown to more than 400 eight-ounce servings per person, per year; in the rest of the nation, it is 270.
1998-08-11	COCA-COLA IN $187 MILLION DEAL FOR RUSSIAN BOTTLER	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would buy one of its Russian bottlers for $187 million from Inchcape P.L.C. The London-based Inchcape is selling its bottlers to concentrate on its world-leading car-distribution business. It is also discussing selling its South American bottling operations to the Chilean bottler Embotelladora Arica S.A. Inchcape had planned to spin off its South American operations. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, regularly buys and sells bottlers as part of a strategy to consolidate its distribution system into a handful of key operators around the world. In the Russian acquisition, Coca-Cola is acquiring Inchcape bottling plants in Nizhny Novgorad, Volgograd, Samara and Yekaterinburg.
1998-08-06	Zyman Joins Board Of Launch Media	Sergio Zyman, the former senior vice president and chief marketing officer at the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, was named to the board of Launch Media Inc. in Santa Monica, Calif., a new media entertainment company specializing in music. ''More mainstream marketers are beginning to understand, as I do, how powerful, intimate and effective the advertising environments offered by Launch are at building relationships with consumers,'' Mr. Zyman said. ''People who view Launch as merely a CD-ROM company or as an interactive media company are missing the point.''
1998-08-04	THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Putting Extra Fizz Into Profits; Critics Say Coca-Cola Dumps Debt on Spinoff	The Coca-Cola money machine has whirred along for years, producing extraordinary profits for investors. What helped set it in motion was management's decision in the late 1980's to remove the capital-intensive bottling factories from the company's books and place them in a separate company. The maneuver has proved so successful that its archrival, Pepsico Inc., a perennial also-ran, recently announced it, too, would consider spinning off its bottling unit. But a growing chorus of financial analysts and accountants is trying to strip the gears of the Coca-Cola Company. They say that Coca-Cola and its giant bottling company, Coca-Cola Enterprises, are essentially one business and should consolidate their financial statements, an argument not lost on the nation's accounting rule makers.
1998-07-24	Pepsico Studies Possible Conversion of Bottling Operations	Pepsico yesterday made its second major move this week to become a fiercer competitor to the Coca-Cola Company, saying it was studying the possible conversion of some bottling operations into a separate publicly traded company. The announcement by Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, Roger A. Enrico, was seen by analysts as confirmation that the No. 2 soft-drink company planned to create a major national bottler similar to Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler in the Coca-Cola Company's system, which handles about 65 percent of Coke's volume in the United States.
1998-07-17	Coke's Earnings Down; Pepsi Reports Early With a Gain	The Coca-Cola Company reported a decline in earnings for the second quarter yesterday, and, in a burst of corporate competitiveness, Pepsico said its earnings rose. Pepsico had not been scheduled to report its financial results until next Tuesday. But a spokesman for the company said the decision was made to move up the announcement because Wall Street had pushed down the price of its shares about 8 percent this week, reacting to a report that sales at the company's Frito-Lay division in a recent four-week period were less than stellar. Pepsi shares closed yesterday at $37.9375, down 18.75 cents.
1998-07-16	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Stepping out a bit from Coke's shadow, a big bottler is basking in its own spotlight these days.	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES INC., the bottling company that is ever the bridesmaid to the giant Coca-Cola Company, is getting a turn in the spotlight after all. While the Asian economic crisis deepens, stock in the bottler provides a brand name that investors trust without the added exposure to Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and other countries whose bubbles have burst.
1998-07-01	New Pepsi Drink to Use Special Sweetener	The Food and Drug Administration approved the use yesterday of an artificial sweetener known as Ace-K in soft drinks. And about an hour later, Pepsico Inc. announced it would be rolling out a new diet cola nationwide by October that will use both Ace-K and aspartame, known to consumers as Nutrasweet or Equal. The approval of Ace-K, marketed by Hoechst A.G. as Sunett and officially known as acesulfame potassium, had been eagerly awaited for almost two years. The product, which gives diet soft drinks a longer shelf life than they had before, is already used in baked goods, chewing gum and other food products in the United States, and is a common ingredient in diet beverages sold across Europe and Asia. In May, the F.D.A. approved another artificial sweetener, sucralose, for use in beverages.
1998-06-22	Looking for a jolt to reverse slowing growth, Diet Coke revives some TV spots from 1996.	IF some commercials you've watched recently for Diet Coke seem familiar, there's a reason: they're reruns. The Coca-Cola Company has brought back spots for Diet Coke that initially began appearing in early 1996. The commercials, which feature youthful characters in urban settings and an upbeat rendition of the brand's ''Just for the taste'' jingle, are to run through the summer.
1998-06-03	Pepsi Cuts Link With Bottler After Threat on Coke's Suit	In a highly unusual move, Pepsico broke off a 32-year franchise agreement with one of its largest independent bottlers yesterday, saying that the bottler had threatened to intervene in Pepsico's lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Company. According to Pepsi officials, executives from the bottler, the Central Investment Company of Cincinnati, met with Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, Roger A. Enrico, on Monday and insisted that a number of demands be met within 24 hours or that they would enter into the suit as a counter-plaintiff on Coke's side. Central Investment, which also bottles Pepsi products in Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Fla., demanded more territory in Florida and Ohio, money for marketing expenses and a limit on prices of concentrate, Pepsi officials said.
1998-05-29	Coca-Cola Asks the Dismissal Of Federal Suit Filed by Pepsi	Lawyers for the Coca-Cola Company filed a motion yesterday to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Pepsico Inc. earlier this month, in which Pepsi, breathing new fire into the cola wars, contends that Coke unfairly pressed food-service distributors to provide only Coke to restaurants, theater chains, stadiums and other places that serve what the industry calls fountain soft drinks. In a 32-page brief that ranges from avuncular to punitive in tone, Coke argued that Pepsi's definition of the market being monopolized was not sufficient grounds for antitrust litigation. ''That so-called 'market' is really nothing more than a group of Coca-Cola fountain syrup distributors with whom Pepsi chose not to do business until just last year,'' it said.
1998-05-26	Putting Africa On Coke's Map; Pushing Soft Drinks on a Continent That Has Seen Hard, Hard Times	On the edge of the black South African township of Soweto, perched atop Vic de Villiers's gas station roof, is a retired South African Air Force warplane, known as the Coke Bomber. Earlier this month, workers showed up to give the plane, which bears the Coca-Cola Company's trademark red logo, a fresh paint job, courtesy of Coke. Coke is now also paying Mr. de Villiers to illuminate the plane at night. Elsewhere in South Africa, in the vast Orange Farm shantytown outside Johannesburg, the refrigerators at tiny ''spaza shops,'' run out of the backs of tin and cinderblock houses, carry Coca-Cola products supplied by local distributors who have plenty of incentive to keep them filled with Coke bottles. Meshack Malindi, one such distributor, says if he can beat all his rivals to double-digit sales growth, he will win a trip to the soccer World Cup in France this summer.
1998-05-24	Fidelity Follows a Crowd It Shunned	WHAT a difference a year makes. In early 1997, Fidelity Investments took to the road, trying to rally the flagging confidence of its mutual fund shareholders in a series of road-show meetings. At the time, relative performance of its big stock funds was off, almost across the board, and Fidelity executives were feeling the heat. The question from investors was: Why the poor results?
1998-05-22	European Coke Concern Expects 10% Profit Gain	Europe's newest Coca-Cola company, whose July listing in London and Sydney, Australia, is expected to give it a market value of $:1.3 billion to $:1.7 billion, or $2.1 billion to $2.9 billion, said yesterday that it would increase sales and profit by at least 10 percent starting this year.
1998-05-20	Coke and 3 More In Brazil Venture	The Coca-Cola Company and three Brazilian bottlers said Monday that they had formed a company to bottle Coca-Cola products in the fast-growing northeastern region of Brazil. The new company, Nordeste Refrigerantes, or Norsa, was formed through an agreement between Coca-Cola and the Jereissati and Aragao groups of Brazil. Investment figures for the venture were not released. The Coelho group is completing procedures to join the company, Coca-Cola said.
1998-05-15	Pepsi Official Opposes Exclusive Drink Deals	In a carefully choreographed act of saber-rattling before an audience of his peers, Philip A. Marineau, the president of Pepsi-Cola North America, declared Pepsi's desire for ''freedom of choice'' yesterday and said exclusive deals pursued by soft-drink companies were not ideal for consumers. But he stopped short of calling for an end to the practice, which both Pepsi and its archrival, the Coca-Cola Company, have pursued for years with restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, colleges and more recently, public schools. Last Thursday, Pepsico Inc. sued Coke in United States District Court in Manhattan, contending that Coke had illegally pressured food-service distributors not to carry Pepsi products.
1998-05-12	Cola Upstart Bubbles Over From Britain	Virgin Cola, the upstart British soft-drink company started three years ago by the music industry and airline executive Richard Branson, plans a plunge into the crowded and hostile American beverage market starting today. Perhaps fittingly, Mr. Branson plans to ride down Fifth Avenue in a vintage Army tank. The move coincides with one of the more intense moments in cola war history. Last week, Pepsico Inc. sued the Coca-Cola Company, contending Coke illegally manipulated food-service distributors, which provide beverages and other supplies to restaurants, theaters and other public places, to prevent them from selling Pepsi products. Coke has said the lawsuit has no merit and vowed to defend itself.
1998-05-08	Pepsico Sues Coca-Cola on Distribution	In a major escalation of the cola wars, Pepsico Inc. sued the Coca-Cola Company yesterday, accusing its archrival of unfairly controlling the beverages served by restaurants and other businesses. At issue is Coke's dominance of what is known as the fountain business, which includes restaurant chains, sports arenas, movie theaters and other businesses that sell soft drinks by the cup, rather than by the can or bottle. Coke has about two-thirds of the market, versus about 22 percent for Pepsi. The entire fountain business accounted for some 22 percent of the 9.6 billion cases of soda sold in the United States last year, and has been the fastest-growing part of the soft-drink industry over the last decade.
1998-04-20	Pepsi Sues Rival Over India Unit	Revealing the intensity of the cola wars, the Pepsi-Cola Company filed a lawsuit last week in New Delhi, accusing the Coca-Cola Company of ''a widespread pattern of disruptive activity'' in India. The complaint accuses Coke of poaching employees, from salesmen to senior executives, by offering higher salaries, better benefits and bonuses to leave the Pepsico unit and work for Coke, a Pepsi spokesman, Keith Hughes, said.
1998-04-16	13.2% Fall in Coca-Cola's Net Tied to Devalued Currencies	The Coca-Cola Company reported a 13.2 percent drop in first-quarter earnings yesterday, sending its stock down $1.188 a share to close at $76.6875. The company attributed the decline to devalued currencies in many countries where it does business. Also, a one-time gain a year earlier from the sale of the company's 49 percent stake in Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages, a British bottler, accounted for 8 cents of last year's first-quarter earnings, a company spokesman, Rob Baskin, said.
1998-03-26	Coca-Cola prepares a summertime pitch for teen-agers that may be its most aggressive ever.	SUMMER is just around the corner. And along with the hissing of sprinklers and the chirping of crickets must come the roar of marketing's heavy artillery as Coca-Cola and Pepsi battle for consumer loyalty during the hottest, thirstiest months on the calendar. This year, the Coca-Cola Company plans what may be its most aggressive effort ever with the teen-age and 20-something set by distributing 55 million copies of its ''Coke Card,'' a bright red, wallet-size card that promotes Coca-Cola Classic and Diet Coke through tie-ins with local and national stores.
1998-03-23	Coca-Cola's roster of agencies could be downsized when a marketing executive leaves.	FOR Madison Avenue, the countdown to change at the Coca-Cola Company is under way. That countdown began on Thursday, when Coca-Cola announced that Sergio Zyman would leave on May 1 after almost five years as senior vice president and chief marketing officer. Mr. Zyman was instrumental in fundamentally remaking the Coca-Cola agency roster, broadly expanding the list to more than two dozen shops worldwide.
1998-03-20	A marketing star's decision to move on leaves Coca-Cola facing 'Life After Sergio.'	SERGIO ZYMAN, the marketing executive widely credited with shaking awake a slumbering, hidebound Coca-Cola Company and teaching it to sing a more youthful tune, has resigned. Now Madison Avenue and the soft drink industry must face ''Life After Sergio,'' which sounds like a spicy soap opera but could be a tamer version of what has gone before. Mr. Zyman's departure after four and a half years, announced yesterday in an internal corporate memo, had been expected since the trade publications Advertising Age, Adweek and Brandweek reported on Monday that he would resign. His decision closes one of the more colorful chapter in the venerable company's history.
1998-03-10	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- Be True to Your Cola, Rah! Rah!; Battle for Soft-Drink Loyalties Moves to Public Schools	The Jefferson County school district in Colorado needed a new football stadium. The Lebanon, Ohio, school district had a crumbling outdoor track. The Keller Independent School District, outside Fort Worth, wanted to make sure its value as one of the state's fastest-growing and best-performing school systems did not go unrecognized. So, in recent weeks, all three have signed contracts with Coca-Cola or Pepsi agreeing, for a price, to eliminate the competition's products from vending machines in their hallways and from concession stands at sports events. At Jefferson, you can buy only Pepsi; Coke rules at Lebanon and Keller. All this spotlights the latest battleground in the cola wars: America's public schools.
1998-02-23	Schweppes Is Said to Agree to a Bottling Deal	Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C., the maker of Dr Pepper and 7-Up, is expected to announce as early as today that it will acquire a pair of Midwestern bottling companies in a $730 million deal as the first step in creating a national distribution system of its own. The move, which has been anticipated for six months by analysts and others in the industry and was reported Saturday in The Financial Times, is expected to involve a joint venture between Cadbury and a Washington investment firm, the Carlyle Group, according to beverage industry analysts. It is seen as a major investment and strategic play by Cadbury, which has long relied on bottlers controlled by its chief rivals, the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico's Pepsi-Cola, to distribute more than half of its products, while independent bottlers handle the rest.
1998-02-15	Here's How The Chiefs Stock Up	WHILE keeping up with the Joneses is a middle-class tradition, catching up with the Gateses has become the game for chief executives, whose 1997 pay and company stock holdings will be disclosed in the weeks ahead as companies mail their annual reports. Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm in Manhattan, analyzed stock and stock options of chief executives at 200 of the largest publicly traded companies. The firm tossed out the top 10 and bottom 10 wealth holders and found that the remaining 180 chiefs had an average of $57.8 million in their company's equity on the last day of 1997. That includes shares owned outright or in tax-deferred accounts and options, both those that can be cashed in and those not yet vested.
1998-02-05	Big Coca-Cola Bottler Will Split Into 2 Parts	The Coca-Cola Company's second-largest bottler, Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd., will be be carved into two companies, one based in Europe and the other in Australia, to better focus on regional business demands. In addition, the new entities will acquire bottlers in Italy and South Korea for a total of $1.4 billion in equity and cash, the Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday.
1998-01-29	Coca-Cola Profit Increases 7% in Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its earnings rose 7 percent in the fourth quarter, falling just shy of Wall Street estimates despite stronger-than-expected growth in soft-drink sales. The results were the first to be reported under M. Douglas Ivester since he succeeded Roberto C. Goizueta, who died in October, as chairman and chief executive. They reflected both the success of the company's restructured global bottling system and the extent to which poor currency exchange rates are dragging down profits for multinational companies.
1998-01-28	Post-game analysis of Super Bowl statistics that really count -- commercial winners and losers.	MADISON AVENUE is poring over the post-game analyses of the ad bowl played during Super Bowl XXXII with all the intensity that the Green Bay Packers ought to have brought to San Diego. The results indicate that the upset on the field was matched by an upset on the air: many advertisers and agencies scored with spots that uncharacteristically took risks.
1998-01-21	Coca-Cola Flexes Muscle for a Blitz	The Coca-Cola Company is beginning a monthlong marketing blitz that includes advertising during high-profile events like Super Bowl XXXII and the Winter Olympics. New commercials will include the first work for Diet Coke from Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. The humorous Diet Coke spots consist of two sets of three serial commercials. In one set, a 20-something man and his parents discuss setbacks in his career and love life, which turn out to be related. In the other set, a father awkwardly explains the facts of life to his young daughter.
1998-01-13	Wieden Is Asked For Diet Coke Ideas	The Coca-Cola Company is again seeking ideas for its Diet Coke soft drink beyond the brand's agency of record, Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, by naming Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., to handle undisclosed creative television assignments. ''We are always looking for opportunities to strengthen the marketing efforts for our brands,'' Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, said yesterday in confirming reports of the assignment this week in trade publications. Wieden & Kennedy was selected based on the ''good work'' the agency has done for the company, he added, such as sports-theme campaigns for the flagship Coca-Cola brand.
1998-01-12	Pepsico Will Test-Market A New Lemon-Lime Drink	Tired of watching the lemon-lime soft drink market swallowed up by its competitors, Pepsi-Cola plans to test a new version in at least one city later this year. Brad Shaw, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola, confirmed on Friday what had long been rumored: that Pepsi was ready to introduce a lemon-lime drink, christened Storm, which will be test-marketed in Denver this year.
1997-12-25	Corrections	An entry in the Business Digest on Tuesday for an article about Coca-Cola's proposed purchase of Orangina misspelled the surname of the chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola. He is Douglas Ivester, not Ivestor.
1997-12-09	3 Companies In U.S. Share Asia's Pain	Several American companies in widely different industries -- aerospace, soft drinks and computer software -- but with big global presences are beginning to feel negative effects from Asia's financial crisis. The Boeing Company said yesterday that Asian airlines might delay taking delivery of as many as 60 jetliners over the next three years because economic problems were slowing growth in airline traffic. Securities analysts said profits at Coca-Cola Company would decline in the fourth quarter and in 1998 from a strong dollar, which has risen sharply against Asian currencies. And the Oracle Corporation reported disappointing earnings, also hurt partly by the dollar's strength.
1997-12-02	Cola companies are increasingly squaring off in movie theaters.	THE Bijou is becoming another battleground in the cola wars. The Coca-Cola Company is seeking to increase its already commanding market share in movie theaters with an ambitious advertising and promotional campaign centered on film. The campaign extends from screens to concession counters to lobbies and is even reaching out to film schools nationwide.
1997-12-01	Patents; Giving computers the ability to detect viruses by thinking, more or less, in ways that humans do.	MILLIONS of unsuspecting computer users are vulnerable to software viruses, and most of them have no idea how to fight an infection. So when people at International Business Machines talk about a patent for a virus detective, they like to say they are building an immune system for cyberspace. The patented software uses artificial intelligence intended to detect and expose viruses that have not been seen before, and then alert an I.B.M. data center, where the new virus is analyzed. Warnings, information to identify the virus, and antidotes are then sent across I.B.M.'s own network and the Internet.
1997-11-11	COKE TO BUY BOTTLING ASSETS OF KOREAN CONCERN	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would acquire the soft drink bottling assets of the Doosan Beverage Company for $450 million, giving it control over bottling, distribution and sales of Coca-Cola products in South Korea. The move follows Coca-Cola's acquisition of its other Korean bottlers -- the Honam Foods Company and the Woosung Food Company -- earlier this year. Coca-Cola has about 59 percent of Korea's $1 billion soft drink market, according to the industry publication Beverage Digest. Pepsico Inc. has 12.3 percent.
1997-10-30	Chairman Outlines Blueprint For a Slimmed-Down Pepsico	Describing Pepsico Inc. as ''the ultimate challenger,'' Craig E. Weatherup, chairman and chief executive of the Pepsi-Cola Company, took aim at its archrival yesterday while offering a blueprint for Pepsi's slimmed-down, more focused future. Addressing a conference in New York of the National Soft Drink Association, the largest industry trade group, 23 days after Pepsico Inc. spun off its fast-food restaurants, Mr. Weatherup said that now ''we're a can of Pepsi and a bag of Lay's -- that's it,'' referring to Frito-Lay, the company's snack business.
1997-10-29	Coke's New Chairman Sees No Major Shifts in Strategy	In his first public appearance since his appointment as chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company last week, M. Douglas Ivester announced no major changes yesterday in the strategy of the company. He does not anticipate any ''left turns or right turns,'' he said, and he sought to reassure investors about the soundness of the world's largest beverage company in the face of market turmoil.
1997-10-24	Ivester Is Named to Top Posts at Coca-Cola	As expected, the board of the Coca-Cola Company elected M. Douglas Ivester chairman and chief executive yesterday, replacing Roberto C. Goizueta, who died on Saturday at the age of 65. But the 13-member board did not select a president to replace the 50-year-old Mr. Ivester, setting up what beverage executives and analysts believe to be a three-way race for the job.
1997-10-22	Business and Politics Merge To Mourn Coke's Chairman	Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company who died on Saturday, was remembered today in a funeral service attended by prominent executives and politicians. Mr. Goizueta, 65, led Coca-Cola, based here, for 16 years. He helped revise the company's financial strategy while strengthening its global dominance in soft drinks.
1997-10-21	When Death Hits a Corner Office; Coping With Loss of a Top Executive Requires Planning	As soon as Michael H. Walsh, the Tenneco Corporation's former chief executive, began feeling ill in 1993, he told Dana G. Mead, his close friend and handpicked successor. Three months later, when his doctors suggested a biopsy, he told Dr. Peter Flawn, a senior board member. Only when the biopsy showed brain cancer did he and Mr. Mead tell the rest of the world. Then, however, they told and told. Mr. Walsh and Mr. Mead sat for countless interviews and analysts' meetings to demonstrate that Mr. Walsh was still functioning at a high level but that Mr. Mead was ready to step in -- which he did, in February 1994, three months before Mr. Walsh died.
1997-10-20	Shift in Focus Is Expected At Coca-Cola	With the death of Roberto C. Goizueta, its chairman and chief executive, the Coca-Cola Company is expected to focus more attention on developing the enormous global network that he built up during his 16-year reign. Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink maker, is likely to accelerate its shift in emphasis from expansion to exploiting its existing dominance around the world.
1997-10-19	Roberto C. Goizueta, Coca-Cola Chairman Noted for Company Turnaround, Dies at 65	Roberto C. Goizueta, a Cuban refugee who became chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, strengthening its global dominance in soft drinks and building one of the greatest generators of shareholder wealth in corporate history, died early today at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. He was 65 and lived in Atlanta. The cause was complications from treatment for lung cancer, the company said. Mr. Goizueta, a heavy smoker, had a malignant tumor that was discovered in early September.
1997-10-17	Coca-Cola Profits Climbed By 4.4% in Third Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company reported a 4.4 percent increase in third-quarter earnings yesterday. Although the company posted higher-than-expected beverage volumes, earnings were suppressed by a reduction in income from divested bottlers and the negative impact of the strong dollar on international revenues. Earnings rose to $1.011 billion, or 41 cents a share, from $967 million, or 39 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1996, meeting the consensus estimate of 19 Wall Street analysts, according to First Call, which compiles analysts' estimates. Coca-Cola had advised analysts in August that it expected earnings to rise only slightly from the corresponding quarter last year.
1997-10-14	Coke's Chairman Is Critically Ill; Some Duties Given to President	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its chairman and chief executive, Roberto C. Goizueta, was in critical condition in an intensive-care unit of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, suffering from a throat infection and fever contracted during treatment for lung cancer. His condition has ''significantly worsened,'' the company said, with the throat infection further weakening an immune system already impaired by the radiation and chemotherapy treatments that followed the cancer diagnosis in early September.
1997-10-01	Gains Harder For Blue Chips In 3d Quarter	Call it the crash of the titans. Though the third quarter, which ended yesterday, saw the Dow Jones industrial average set yet another closing high, it also saw some of its component shares falter.
1997-09-27	Coke Expands in Russia	The Coca-Cola Company said on Thursday that it planned to invest $116.5 million to open four plants in Russia. The plants bring the Atlanta-based company's investment in Russia to $600 million. The new plants will be in Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East; Krasnoyarsk, in central Siberia; Nizhny Novgorod, in central Russia, and Rostov-on-Don, in southern Russia. The Vladivostok plant is fully owned by Coca-Cola, while the other three are joint ventures with local companies.
1997-09-16	Chief of Coke Still in Hospital	The Coca-Cola Company's chairman and chief executive, Roberto C. Goizueta, has begun a dual regimen of radiation and chemotherapy to treat a malignant lung tumor discovered last week. Mr. Goizueta, 65, began the treatments over the weekend, and his stay in the hospital has been extended two to three days, a Coca-Cola spokesman, Randy Donaldson, said.
1997-09-10	7Up to Change Its Formula	The Dr Pepper/Seven-Up beverage unit of Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. will change the recipe for its 7Up soft drink in a bid to gain on Sprite, a brand of the Coca-Cola Company, a Cadbury official said today.
1997-09-09	Coca-Cola Chief Is Hospitalized	The Coca-Cola Company's chairman and chief executive, Roberto Goizueta, has been hospitalized for treatment of a localized malignant lung tumor, the company said today. The tumor was found after Mr. Goizueta, 65, felt unusually tired during a recent overseas business trip and checked into Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for tests upon his return, the company said.
1997-09-04	Pepsico Wins $94 Million For Defection By Bottler	Recouping some of its losses from a defection in Venezuela last year, Pepsico Inc. won a $94 million award that was announced yesterday at the International Court of Arbitration in Paris. The arbitration, which was conducted in New York but announced in Paris, called for the Cisneros Group, Pepsi's longtime Venezuelan bottler that defected to its archrival, the Coca-Cola Company, to pay $87 million for breaking its Pepsi contract, plus $7 million in costs and fees.
1997-08-22	Caffeinated Drinks Catering to Excitable Boys and Girls	They can get you ''high'' or give you a quick ''lift.'' Some people just want them for the ''buzz'' or the sheer pleasure of getting a ''rush,'' while others are lured by the possibility of heightening their sexual drive. If these descriptions elicit the illicit, that is because they are probably meant to. These are the terms behind the marketing for a popular new brand of soft drinks called energy drinks or extreme beverages. The beverages are generally high in caffeine and sometimes laced with so-called exotic additives, like Brazilian guarana berries or ginseng. And they all appeal to young people.
1997-07-18	Coke's Net Up by 24.8% In 2d Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company reported yesterday that earnings rose 24.8 percent in the second quarter, lifted by after-tax gains from the restructuring of its bottling network and by international volume growth. Net income rose to $1.31 billion, or 53 cents a share, from $1.05 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1996, meeting the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts.
1997-06-20	Glamour magazine signs up Diet Coke, NBC and Target.	IN a multifaceted promotional marketing campaign, a leading women's magazine is joining forces with a giant advertiser, a big retailer and the No. 1 television network. The elaborate multimillion-dollar campaign is centered on the Women of the Year Awards that are bestowed by Glamour, one of the Conde Nast magazines owned by Advance Publications. The partners recruited by Glamour for the foursome are: the Coca-Cola USA division of the Coca-Cola Company, which will be pitching its Diet Coke soft-drink brand; Target, the discount retail chain operated by the Dayton Hudson Corporation, which peddles Diet Coke and Glamour at its 751 stores, and NBC, part of the General Electric Company.
1997-06-03	Top Soft-Drink Makers Raise Stakes in Brand War	The beverage wars among the nation's top three soft-drink producers intensified yesterday as Pepsico Inc. said that it would create a new division for its $6.14 billion company-owned bottling operations to increase its competitiveness. In a separate initiative, the company's archrival, the Coca-Cola Company, the industry leader, confirmed that it was trying to banish Dr Pepper/Seven Up, the nation's third-largest beverage company, from thousands of McDonald's restaurants. Coke and Dr Pepper have exchanged dueling letters over the issue, and legal action or a regulatory complaint is possible.
1997-05-24	Pepsico Bottling Operation In South Africa Is Closed	The Pepsico Inc. franchise bottler in South Africa, New Age Beverages, has ceased operations, ceding the country's $1 billion beverage market to Pepsi's archrival, the Coca-Cola Company. Pepsico announced yesterday that the bottler had filed for voluntary liquidation in a Johannesburg court and that the company had already ceased operations.
1997-05-20	Coca-Cola goes after share of mouth with Fruitopia campaign	MOST consumers have yet to find Xanadu or Shangri-La, much less Utopia, inside a bottle of Fruitopia. So as that juice drink brand enters its fourth summer, its parent, the Coca-Cola Company, is intensifying efforts to gain what the beverage industry calls share of mouth. Beginning this week, Coca-Cola will remake Fruitopia's advertising as part of ambitious efforts to increase sales of noncarbonated beverages, which include iced teas, sports drinks and juices as well as juice drinks.
1997-05-14	Coca-Cola will take a new tack to appeal to diet-soda drinkers.	THE Coca-Cola Company, tinkering again with the advertising approach for Diet Coke, is seeking to convince consumers to buy the brand not just for the taste of it but just for the heck of it. Or as younger consumers might say, for whatever.
1997-05-13	Panamerican Beverages and Venezuelan Bottler to Merge	Panamerican Beverages Inc., Latin America's largest soft drink bottling company and one of the world's largest Coca-Cola bottlers, said yesterday that it had agreed to merge with Coca-Cola y Hit de Venezuela, Venezuela's leading soft drink bottler, in a cash and stock transaction valued at about $1.2 billion. The deal comes less than a year after the Cisneros Group of Companies, which at the time owned the Venezuelan operation outright, stunned the beverage industry by ending a 50-year relationship with Pepsico Inc. to become a joint venture partner with its archrival, the Coca-Cola Company.
1997-05-01	Europe to Study Coke-Carlsberg Deal	Europe's antitrust regulators will start a full investigation of a proposed joint venture by the Coca-Cola Company and Carlsberg A/S to bottle and distribute Coke products, industry sources said today. Coca-Cola and Carlsberg, Denmark's biggest brewing group, agreed last year to form Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages as the holding company for operations in Denmark, Sweden and later Norway. Regulators are concerned that the venture will have a stranglehold on the Scandinavian market, the sources said.
1997-04-29	Coke Campaign to Challenge Pepsi's 'Stuff'	No, the promotional and advertising campaign the Coca-Cola Company detailed yesterday will not be named ''Coke Stuff,'' despite the fact that there are similarities to the ''Pepsi Stuff'' campaign of the company's archrival. Actually, the promotion, the company's largest such effort, will be called ''Coca-Cola Incredible Summer,'' and it will start in late May. In the United States, the company will distribute 450,000 debit cards, with up to $100 loaded on them, in packages of Coca-Cola, as well as offer Coke merchandise and other awards like trips to sunny climes.
1997-04-16	Pepsico says a new campaign for Diet Pepsi isn't a war with Sprite, and isn't brain surgery either.	WHILE makers of soft drinks play down talk of a soda war, the battle for market share is clearly intensifying. Pepsico Inc. said yesterday that it was starting a new ad campaign for Diet Pepsi. The announcement comes a day after the Coca-Cola Company introduced a new campaign for its Sprite brand.
1997-04-15	Coke Earnings Climb 38.4% in Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company reported strong first-quarter earnings yesterday, buoyed by the highest growth in its domestic soft drink volume in 11 years. The company said net income grew to $987 million, or 40 cents a share, up 38.4 percent from $713 million, or 28 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The earnings matched analysts' expectations, adjusting for a gain of $198 million, or 8 cents a share, from the sale of Coke's 49 percent stake in its British bottling operations to Coca-Cola Enterprises.
1997-04-15	Coca-Cola is introducing a pithy new campaign for its fast-growing Sprite soft drink.	THE taste of Sprite soft drink may be the same, but the advertising for the lemon-lime soda will soon have even more flavor. The Coca-Cola Company is introducing a series of pithy ads for the brand, and is increasing its campaign budget, to capitalize on the popularity of the drink, which is the fastest-growing brand in the country.
1997-04-04	Coca-Cola Gives Sprite Can a New Look	And now, the embossed soda can. The Coca-Cola Company introduced a new aluminum can yesterday for its rapidly growing Sprite soft drink brand. The can features embossed soda bubbles and indented, silvery streaks that set off the word ''Sprite'' on the side of the can.
1997-03-28	COCA-COLA EXPECTS RISE IN WORLDWIDE SALES	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it expected worldwide case sales to rise from 7 percent to 8 percent in the first quarter compared with the corresponding period a year ago. The Atlanta-based soft drink giant also said it expected worldwide gallon sales to rise from 5 percent to 6 percent in the three months ending on Monday. North American case sales in the quarter were expected to rise from 6 percent to 7 percent, and gallon sales were projected to increase from 1 percent to 2 percent. Strong growth was also forecast for Africa, where case volume was expected to rise from 9 percent to 10 percent while gallon sales were expected to increase from 22 percent to 23 percent. Shares of Coca-Cola fell $1.25, to $57.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
1997-03-26	Diet Coke Returns To Its Hunk Theme	The Coca-Cola Company is hoping to get lucky again with a television commercial for Diet Coke that tells a role-reversal tale about women ogling a hunky man. The spot, introduced Monday night during the ABC broadcast of the Academy Awards, shows the man delivering cases of Diet Coke to an office filled with female workers; he is unaware of the admiration he is eliciting from them. The plot is evocative of a popular Diet Coke commercial from 1994 that centered on women ogling a construction worker from their office windows. That spot, and a 1995 sequel, turned a model named Lucky Vanous into a celebrity who subsequently made promotional appearances for Diet Coke.
1997-03-12	Coca-Cola Bottling Officials Indicted in Anti-Union Plot	A Federal grand jury today indicted two prominent officials of the world's largest Coca-Cola bottling company, charging them with bribing a worker with cash payments and a promotion for his assistance in undermining a unionization campaign in 1994. The grand jury, which has been hearing evidence in Atlanta for nearly two years, indicted James Wardlaw, the vice president and general manager of the Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Company, and Eric Turpin, the company's vice president for human resources.
1997-02-25	European Clearance For Coke Enterprises	The European Commission said today that it had approved Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C.'s 15-year licensing agreement with Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., allowing the United States bottler to produce and distribute Cadbury soft drinks in Britain. The move comes a month after the commission, the European Union's executive arm, approved Coca-Cola Enterprises' takeover for $:1.2 billion ($2 billion) of a British bottling company that had been owned by the Coca-Cola Company and Cadbury.
1997-02-01	Profits at Coca-Cola Rose By 18% During 4th Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its profits soared 18 percent during the fourth quarter, buoyed by growth in international soft-drink shipments and by an increase in market share throughout most of the world. Net income rose to $762 million, or 31 cents a share, from $648 million, or 26 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1996, meeting the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts.
1997-01-25	The Cola War Is Expected To Heat Up	By shedding its struggling fast-food restaurants, Pepsi will emerge as a leaner, more focused competitor in its long war with Coca-Cola, industry officials and analysts said yesterday, setting the stage for another escalation of the cola wars. Shares of both Pepsico Inc. and the Coca-Cola Company dropped yesterday after the announcement on Thursday that Pepsico would spin off its fast-food operations as a publicly traded company.
1997-01-08	Coca-Cola somewhat boldly changes its look as a fashion statement.	SUDDENLY, the most familiar packaging on earth doesn't look like the real thing. Without fanfare, or even so much as an announcement, the Coca-Cola Company has tinkered with the design of the legendary cans and bottles that carry its flagship brand.
1996-12-20	COKE SAYS WORLDWIDE SALES OF CASES ARE UP 10%	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it expected worldwide sales of cases to rise about 10 percent in the fourth quarter, a sharp improvement from the third quarter. Coke, the largest maker of soda in the world, said the largest part of the increase occurred in Latin America, Europe, the Mideast and the Far East, where the gains ranged between 16 percent and 10 percent. North American case sales are expected to increase 5 percent to 6 percent. The sales met the most optimistic of Wall Street's forecasts. Shares in Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, rose $2.75, to $51.125, in trading of 5.2 million shares.
1996-12-16	Coca-Cola, in Direct Attack on Pepsi, to Introduce Challenger to Mountain Dew	In an escalation of the soda wars, the Coca-Cola Company plans to challenge Mountain Dew, a 50-year-old icon of successful consumer marketing that has been a major money maker for Pepsico Inc., people with knowledge of Coca-Cola's plans said this weekend. With a Super Bowl debut for a $50 million marketing campaign, these people said, Coca-Cola plans to introduce a competitor that represents its biggest gamble on a soda brand since New Coke was introduced 11 years ago and ended up as an embarrassing flop.
1996-12-06	Boys and Girls Clubs In Project With Coke	The Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that they would join in efforts to raise $60 million over the next decade for a youth-development program sponsored by the clubs.
1996-11-27	Pepsi's holiday-season campaign has promotions with Microsoft and an elf with attitude.	DRINK Pepsi, get software. That's the idea behind a new $20 million promotional campaign that has Pepsi-Cola teaming up with the Microsoft Corporation this holiday season.
1996-11-25	Coke Replaces Pepsi As Grammy Sponsor	The Coca-Cola Company has signed a multiyear agreement to become the exclusive soft-drink sponsor for the annual Grammy Awards ceremonies, covering advertising, marketing and promotional activities. Terms were not disclosed. For 11 years, Coca-Cola's primary rival, the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico Inc., had been the Grammy soft-drink sponsor. As part of the new agreement, Diet Coke will be the sponsor of the 1997 Grammy ceremonies, which are to be held at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 26 and will be televised by CBS. Details of a national consumer promotion involving Diet Coke and the Grammys will be announced in January.
1996-11-22	COCA-COLA SHARES DROP ON FEAR OF LOWER EARNINGS	The stock of the Coca-Cola Company dipped yesterday, a day after remarks by the chief executive raised fears that the company would fail to match Wall Street's earnings expectations for the year. Shares of Coca-Cola closed at $50.625 yesterday, down $1 a share, on New York Stock Exchange trading of 5.7 million shares. Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman and chief executive, told Chicago executives on Wednesday that the company would report 1996 operating income of about $4 billion. Coke's operating income last year was $4.09 billion. A spokesman said Mr. Goizueta's comment was not ''intended to be any kind of forecast.''
1996-11-13	National Easter Seal Announces Awards	The National Easter Seal Society has named the recipients of its seventh annual Equality, Dignity and Independence, or EDI, Awards, which honor communications judged to enhance the independence of people with disabilities. The winners in the print advertising category were the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta and its agency, Bright House,, which is also in Atlanta; the Georgia Power Company and its agency, Copeland Hirthler Design and Communications in Atlanta, and Quickie Designs in Fresno, Calif., a unit of Sunrise Medical, and its in-house agency.
1996-11-07	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES ENDS NORA BEVERAGES BID	Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said yesterday that it was unable to complete the purchase of the Canadian bottled-water producer Nora Beverages. Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest bottler of nonalcoholic drinks, said the $117 million offer, announced in July, had not gained the support of all of Nora's shareholders. The Atlanta-based company said it would continue to distribute Nora's Naya products and would look for another bottled water company. Coca-Cola Enterprises' stock rose $1.375, to $43.75. The Montreal-based Nora has about 1 percent of the United States market for bottled water, which had wholesale sales of $3.4 billion in 1995.
1996-11-03	Can Pepsi Become The Coke of Snacks?	PEPSI'S blue. For starters, Pepsico Inc. all but lost the global cola wars to the Coca-Cola Company this year, making its ballyhooed experiment to abandon the red and white on its cans for basic blue seem like a celebration of style over substance. Meantime, two of its three fast-food chains are floundering, and even Frito-Lay, the snack-food jewel of the corporate crown, momentarily lost some of its sparkle.
1996-10-31	A Coca-Cola Executive Is Joining BBDO	David Wheldon, a top executive at the Coca-Cola Company who was promoted only a month ago, said yesterday that he would leave to join BBDO Worldwide, a leading agency for a Coca-Cola rival, Pepsico Inc. Mr. Wheldon, 40, will become president of BBDO Europe in Paris, assuming duties from the chairman, Vilim Vasata, who will retire Dec. 31. For the last month, Mr. Wheldon had been marketing director for the Greater Europe Group of Coca-Cola after spending two years as advertising director.
1996-10-29	Coca-Cola Expands Role of Lowe Unit	The Coca-Cola Company, in another shuffling of assignments among its many agencies, said yesterday that it had named the Lowe & Partners/SMS unit of the Lowe Group in New York, which handles Diet Coke, to handle creative responsibilities for Coca-Cola Light, the name under which Diet Coke is sold in many overseas markets. Billings were not disclosed.
1996-10-27	At Coke, Less Fizz Than Met The Eye	In a world where a failure to meet quarterly profit forecasts can be punished brutally by Wall Street, stuffing can seem like a wise, if risky, tactic. Stuffing is a way to get profits into the books now, just when they are needed to avoid angering investors. It involves shipping product out the door -- stuffing the pipeline -- so that sales can be recorded, even if that overstates the demand. Many companies, after all, quite legitimately record sales when they ship products to wholesalers, long before the product is sold to a final consumer.
1996-10-18	COCA-COLA EXTENDS ITS BUYBACK OF STOCK	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would repurchase as much as 10 percent of its shares in the next 10 years. The new plan authorizes buying back 206 million shares through 2006. Coke has about 44 million shares remaining in its existing repurchase program, increasing its planned buyback to a quarter of a billion shares. Coca-Cola has long been a buyer of its own stock. Since 1984, Coke has repurchased more than 987 million shares, or about 30 percent of its shares, for about $10 each, or $10 billion. Shares of Coke rose 75 cents yesterday, to $49.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Coke would need to spend $12.3 billion to complete its repurchase.
1996-10-16	Reports by Coke and Pepsi both puzzle.	The eternal rivalry between Pepsico Inc. and the Coca-Cola Company flared again yesterday, as the beverage industry archenemies released their quarterly earnings results on the same day for the first time in more than 20 years, provoking speculation that Coke was trying to steal Pepsi's thunder. But the dueling reports simply called attention to one reality: both companies reported disappointing quarters. Analysts disagreed about the immediate meaning for investors, but they expressed longer-term optimism about these two blue-chip companies. Indeed, the earnings releases from both Coke and Pepsi were so complex that they left ample room for argument.
1996-10-03	COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES BENEFITS COSTLIER THAN EXPECTED	Coca-Cola Enterprises said yesterday that the costs of its employee stock and benefits plan would be $19 million more in its third quarter than in the corresponding period a year earlier. The soft-drink bottler, which is 44 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, said the increase, which equals 10 cents a share, was caused by a 70 percent rise in its stock price this year, including 32 percent in the third quarter. Coca-Cola Enterprises' stock fell $1.625 a share, to $44, on the New York Stock Exchange. Coca-Cola Enterprises expects to spend less on stock-based compensation and benefits in the future.
1996-09-30	Coke Expands Ties With Cliff Freeman	The Coca-Cola Company, in another realignment of assignments among its 30 agencies, has expanded its relationship with Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York by awarding Freeman the assignment to produce worldwide creative work next year for the Fanta line of flavored soft drinks. Though billings were not disclosed, Fanta is the third-best-selling brand for Coca-Cola behind its flagship, Coke, and Diet Coke. The Fanta creative assignment had been handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, a unit of the MacManus Group in New York that continues as agency of record on Fanta, handling media duties, in 12 countries. Fanta sales are negligible in the United States but are strong in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
1996-09-27	Pepsico Plans $500 Million In Charges	Sending a signal that it is losing its global struggle with Coca-Cola, Pepsico Inc. said late yesterday that it was moving to immediately revamp its international operations and that it would take a total of more than $500 million in charges in the third and fourth quarters to cover the costs. Pepsico said it was also reviewing its commitment to its casual-dining business, which includes California Pizza Kitchen, Chevys and East Side Marios restaurants, and would expand its program of selling company-owned Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants to franchisees.
1996-09-21	COKE SHARES FALL AFTER 3D-QUARTER FORECAST	The shares of the Coca-Cola Company fell yesterday in heavy trading after the company said third-quarter sales would fall short of expectations, mainly because of sluggish sales in Europe. Coke, the world's largest beverage maker, said it expects case sales of its soft drinks would rise 6 percent to 7 percent in the third quarter, less than the 7 percent to 8 percent range analysts had expected. The Atlanta-based company said it still expected to match Wall Street's third-quarter earnings forecast of 38 cents a share, based on the average estimate from 14 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Coca-Cola shares fell 87.5 cents, to $51.125, in trading of 7.7 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
1996-09-17	Coca-Cola Expands An Agency's Role	The Coca-Cola Company has further expanded its relationship with Fallon McElligott Berlin in New York by awarding that agency creative duties for Georgia Coffee, a soft drink sold in Japan. Those duties had been handled by the McCann-Erickson Japan unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in Tokyo. Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the reassignment this week in Adweek, adding that Dentsu Inc. in Tokyo will continue handle the media planning and buying responsibilities. Though Mr. Bertini declined to discuss billings, Adweek estimated them at $30 million.
1996-09-10	Pepsico Is Set Back On Coke Sanctions	Pepsico Inc. has been denied its request for additional sanctions against its former bottler and the Coca-Cola Company by Venezuela's Antimonopoly Commission. The commission said today that existing sanctions were sufficient to guard Pepsico's interests while Government officials studied whether a proposed union between Coke and the Cisneros Group would create a soft-drink monopoly.
1996-09-07	COCA-COLA TO ACQUIRE 6% STAKE IN CHILEAN BOTTLER	The Coca-Cola Company agreed yesterday to buy a 6 percent stake in Chile's largest Coke bottler, Embotelladora Andina S.A., expanding its hold on Latin America's soft-drink market. In exchange, Coke will sell Andina 79 percent of the Argentine bottler Inti S.A. Industrial y Comercial, and all of Complejo Industrial PET, a maker of plastic bottles. ''At today's market prices, the 6 percent stake is worth about $127 million,'' said William Landers, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York. The transaction, scheduled to be completed in December, will give Coca-Cola a seat on Andina's board and the potential to increase its stake to 20 percent.
1996-09-04	It's Mr. Pepsi's Team Now	Now that SHAQUILLE O'NEAL has joined the Los Angeles Lakers, the Coca-Cola Company has opted not to renew its sponsorship of the Lakers and Los Angeles Kings. That's because O'Neal is a major Pepsi-Cola spokesman. ''It makes no sense for Coca-Cola to sponsor a team whose marquee player endorses the competition,'' the Coca-Cola spokesman STEVE KOONIN said. (AP)
1996-08-26	The cover is peeled off of Minute Maid's quiet switch to the Leo Burnett Company in June.	IT is usually difficult for the gossipy denizens of Madison Avenue to keep a secret. But one account switch -- involving a familiar grocery brand sold by one of the world's largest marketers -- managed to stay under wraps for two months before being inadvertently disclosed late last week. The switch involved the Minute Maid line of refrigerated and frozen juices sold by the Coca-Cola Foods division of the Coca-Cola Company. The brand's account was moved between two shops on the Coca-Cola agency roster, arriving at the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago from Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York. Though billings were not disclosed, the trade publications Advertising Age and Brandweek estimate annual advertising spending on Minute Maid at $12.6 million.
1996-08-25	Tempest in a Soda Truck	Venezuela used to be Pepsi country, but that changed abruptly when Coca-Cola made a deal with a big Venezuelan bottler. This truck was repainted with the Coke logo last week while still full of Pepsi.
1996-08-24	VENEZUELA TO STUDY CHARGE BROUGHT BY PEPSICO	Venezuela's Antimonopoly Commission said yesterday that it would study a motion submitted by Pepsico Inc. that a proposed joint venture between its former bottler -- the Cisneros Group -- and the Coca-Cola Company would create a soft drink monopoly, in violation of Venezuelan law. ''We have decided to open an investigation into the Pepsi complaint,'' said Francisco Suniaga, a commission official. ''We will ask the Cisneros Group and Coca-Cola to defend themselves against Pepsi's charges.'' Pepsi had filed suit with the commission on Monday, charging that the proposed joint venture between the Cisneros Group, and Coke constituted an ''illegal attempt by Coke to control the Venezuelan market by creating a soft drink monopoly.''
1996-08-21	Letterman Stars In Coke Film Ad	The Coca-Cola Company has recruited David Letterman and a group of mediagenic youngsters for a 90-second sponsored message that will begin appearing Friday before films shown at 9,000 movie theaters. Mr. Letterman, the star of ''Late Show With David Letterman'' on CBS, is featured with the children in ''The Late Show's Kids on Film,'' an extension of skits in which Mr. Letterman talks to people too young to stay up for his program. In ''Kids on Film,'' a boy displays his technique for dying on film and a girl critiques Mr. Letterman's stint as host of the 1995 Academy Awards.
1996-08-21	How Venezuela Is Becoming Coca-Cola Country	Roger A. Enrico, now chief executive of Pepsico Inc., and Oswaldo Cisneros, whose family ran Pepsi's oldest and most highly respected bottling operation, were close. Among other things, they and their wives traveled together on business. Indeed, Mr. Enrico was taking a turn on the dance floor with Mr. Cisneros's wife, Ella, in a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey, on the eve of a safari they were to take, when he suffered the heart attack that sidetracked him, for a time, from reaching the summit of Pepsico. Fast forward to last Wednesday, in the 26-story Atlanta headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company. Mr. Cisneros and a dozen of his relatives and executives had flown up secretly from Venezuela. There, Mr. Cisneros signed a contract that made his company -- Pepsi's bottler in Venezuela for five decades -- a joint-venture partner with Pepsi's global archrival. Then they all adjourned to celebrate the coup over dinner in an intimate celebration given by Roberto C. Goizueta, Coke's chief executive, and M. Douglas Ivester, the company's president.
1996-08-20	A Pepsi Challenge To Coke Agreement	Pepsico Inc. formally petitioned the Government of Venezuela yesterday to block the Coca-Cola Company from forming a joint venture with the Cisneros Group, which had been Pepsi's bottling company in Venezuela for the last 47 years. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of Pepsico fell $1 to close at $30.50.
1996-08-17	A Coke Coup in Venezuela Leaves Pepsi High and Dry	The global cola war between The Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. heated up in Venezuela yesterday, as Coke raided Pepsi's venerable bottling company there, and Pepsi threatened legal action. In what was viewed by analysts as an embarrassment to Pepsi-Cola and a blow to the company's international expansion plans, the Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday that it had formed a joint-venture company with the Cisneros Group of Venezuela, a Pepsi bottler for five decades.
1996-08-06	Leading Olympic Advertiser? NBC	NBC, whose coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics drew some criticism for the heavy rotation of commercials it broadcast, turns out to have been the biggest advertiser during the Games. According to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising, commercials for NBC dominated the network's coverage of the Atlanta Games, which began July 19 and ended on Sunday. NBC, which is owned by the General Electric Company, had 552 commercials promoting its news, sports and television programming.
1996-07-26	Fruitopia Changes Its Campaign Slogan	"The Coca-Cola Company has changed the slogan for its Fruitopia line of beverages after a complaint from Saab Cars USA Inc., which uses a similar slogan. The Leo Burnett Company in Chicago introduced a campaign for Fruitopia in the spring that carried the theme ""Find your own Fruitopia."" Soon, Saab Cars pointed out that it had been using as a slogan the phrase ""Find your own road,"" which was created by the Angotti, Thomas, Hedge unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York."
1996-07-21	Coke at a Price	"To the Editor: I have just returned from Paris, with a cautionary tale. Although you can find Diet Coke in French stores, most cafes and restaurants don't have it. When they do, it's usually a very small bottle, never served with ice, and costs at least $6. One afternoon my traveling companion and I, both tired and thirsty, flopped down at a cafe called Le Soleil d'Or not far from Notre Dame. When I asked the courteous waiter if they had Diet Coke, he said: ""Certainly. Would you like a small, medium or large?"" Without even thinking I said, ""Large, please,"" figuring it would probably be about 12 ounces."
1996-07-16	Coca-Cola Reports Profit Was Up 17% in 2d Quarter	Buoyed not only by its growing share in international markets and its high-margin sales of concentrate syrup but also its high-profile advertising in preparation for the Centennial Olympic Games, the Coca-Cola Company reported yesterday that its profits had soared 17 percent during the second quarter. Net income rose to $1.05 billion, or 42 cents a share, from $898 million, or 35 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year, matching the expectations of analysts.
1996-07-03	What Connects Izzy to Atlanta? (Just Guess!)	"To the Editor: Regarding the ""playfully named"" Olympic mascot that nobody can quite identify (Week in Review, June 30), you say that Izzy ""has nothing whatsoever to do with Atlanta."" But it was an Atlanta corporation, and one that will be ubiquitously prominent in the Olympic Games, that spared no expense a decade ago teaching us how to solve for X in the equation ""X is it,"" attempting brand-name appropriation of the universal signifier."
1996-06-21	BIG INCREASE IN GLOBAL SALES VOLUME IS SEEN	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it expected global sales volume to increase by 8 percent to 9 percent for the second quarter, the biggest surge since the second quarter of 1995. Coca-Cola also said it was comfortable with Wall Street's expectations that it would earn 42 cents a share in the second quarter. In the second quarter of 1995, Coca-Cola earned $898 million, or 71 cents a share before a 2-for-1 stock split in May, on revenue of $4.94 billion. Analysts had expected a global volume increase of about 7 percent in the latest period. In the second quarter of 1995, global volume increased 10 percent. Separately, Carlsberg A.S., the largest brewer in Denmark, said that it was negotiating to become Coca-Cola's distribution partner in Sweden and Norway. Carlsberg already distributes Coke in Denmark.
1996-06-19	Atlanta Journal;Sponsors' Messages Vie In Games' Biggest Event	The huge Coke bottle rises six stories from its base just outside the Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta, a monument to corporate America and contemporary kitsch. It is the silo-size centerpiece of Coca-Cola's Olympic City, but it is just one of the giant logo-bearing temples to advertising that are nearing completion in Atlanta's downtown, both inside and outside the Olympic Park, the central gathering place of the Summer Games. Some two million people are expected to pass through this part of the city during the Games, making it an advertising executive's dream.
1996-06-17	Coke Upgrades Nestea Campaign	"The Coca-Cola Company will try expanding the cola wars to another front with a marketing blitz for Cool from Nestea, a fast-growing brand of ready-to-drink iced tea aimed at younger consumers. For the first time, Cool from Nestea ""will be a core brand for our bottlers"" along with Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke and Sprite, said Tom Reddin, consumer marketing director for noncarbonated beverages at Coca-Cola USA in Atlanta. Efforts that begin today include a product reformulation, new packaging, availability at fountains and a hip advertising campaign by Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, which was awarded the brand's account in March."
1996-06-05	Coca-Cola Enterprises Adds to Europe Stake	"Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., continuing to increase its share of the European market, said today that it would buy the British bottling operations co-owned by the Coca-Cola Company and Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. for about $1.9 billion. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is owned 44 percent by Coca-Cola and is the world's largest bottler of that company's drinks, bought Coca-Cola's French and Belgian bottling operations for $915 million in May and has a three-year-old business in the Netherlands. Those operations plus the British bottling company, the nation's largest with a 23 percent market share, will account for 28 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises' overall volume. ""In those four, there are economies of scale,"" said Roy Burry, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ""You can raise their profit margins substantially."""
1996-05-16	Coca-Cola and Pepsi Plan Big Campaigns	"The Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. escalated their continuing marketing battle yesterday by introducing multibillion-dollar promotional programs involving the Summer Olympics and Lucasfilm Ltd., producer of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Coca-Cola announced what it called the largest promotion in company history, which combines an annual summertime promotion with a promotion tied to the Coca-Cola sponsorship of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. In the Coca-Cola Red Hot Olympic Summer promotion, which begins on Monday and runs through Aug. 4, packages of Coca-Cola soft drinks will carry game pieces offering $1.6 billion worth of prizes and merchandise discounts. The Southfield, Mich., office of W. B. Doner & Company, which handles projects for Coca-Cola, will create advertising for the promotion."
1996-04-24	Three Marketers Name Agencies	Three consumer marketers have named agencies already on their rosters to help market new products. The Best Foods division of CPC International in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., named BBDO New York to introduce a line of salad dressings under the Hellmann's name in the East and Best Foods name in the West. The billings were not disclosed, but Advertising Age estimated that $31 million would be spent on advertising and promotions. BBDO New York, a unit of the Omnicom Group that already handles the Hellmann's and Best Foods brands of mayonnaise, was awarded the assignment without a review.
1996-04-18	Coca-Cola's First-Quarter Net Rose 12% on 9% Revenue Gain	The Coca-Cola Company reported a 12 percent increase in first-quarter earnings today, but sluggish sales increases in Latin America and Africa continued to be a drag on its international profits. The company also said that it had repurchased about four million shares during the quarter and that shareholders had approved a 2-for-1 stock split.
1996-04-11	Coca-Cola USA Picks 2 Agencies	The Coca-Cola USA division of the Coca-Cola Company has named Highway One Communications in San Francisco, an affiliate of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, and Block & Nardizzi in Stamford, Conn. to handle a variety of promotional marketing campaigns. Billings were not disclosed. Ben Deutsch, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the appointments this week in Adweek. The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Highway One, Block & Nardizzi and four other finalists: Einson Freeman in Paramus, N.J., a unit of the WPP Group; Frankel & Company in Chicago; the Flair Communications Agency in Chicago, and McCracken Brooks Communications in Minneapolis, which is owned by BDDP Worldwide.
1996-04-09	Coca-Cola Changes Some Fruitopia Flavors	The Coca-Cola Company said it was dropping six flavors of its Fruitopia beverages and adding two in a drive to remake the brand. The company said the flavors being dropped were not selling well. Coke also plans marketing changes including easier-to-read labels, a new slogan and promotions.
1996-03-28	Coke's Hometown Olympics;The Company Tries the Big Blitz on Its Own Turf	The ultimate marketer will soon put on its biggest show right in its own backyard. From July 19 through Aug. 4, the 1996 Olympic Games will unite the world's largest sporting event and the world's largest beverage company -- and, for the first time, do it right here in the city where Coca-Cola was born 110 years ago in the basement of a little house on Marietta Street.
1996-03-25	Pepsi and Coke Plans For Special Drinks	"Two lines of so-called New Age beverages are being overhauled as competition in the category intensifies. The Coca-Cola Company is remaking its Fruitopia line of beverages to play up the fruit flavors and their unusual names like Strawberry Passion Awareness and Mind Over Mango. Advertising that evoked psychedelic imagery of the 1960's is being replaced by a quirky campaign carrying the theme ""Find your own Fruitopia"" that celebrates ""the power of fruit""; one commercial shows wiggling, giggling fruits in a hotel bed."
1996-03-13	Coca-Cola's Forecast Only Spurs Debate	The Coca-Cola Company served up business estimates and sales statistics today in an effort to woo 200 analysts who gathered at its headquarters here. But the company succeeded only in perpetuating a disagreement about the future appeal of its pricey shares. The company suggested that in the current quarter, the number of cases of beverages shipped internationally by its bottlers would rise 7 percent. In the United States and Canada, the increase is expected to be 7 to 8 percent.
1996-03-10	A Rationed Coke	THE FORMAT WAS SIMPLICITY itself: porridge for breakfast, rice pudding for lunch and some ungodly mix of the remains for dinner. Malefactors were punished by being given more, and people who begged off were made to eat every last drop under the supervision of a tennis-shoe-wielding master. Plates, floors, even the pockets of our corduroy jackets were soon encrusted with a white glop that could have afforded archeologists a lifetime of exploration. And yet, at my English boarding school, there was one consolation. On a few Sunday mornings in the summer term, an elaborate kind of lottery was held, whereby any boy whose surname began with a letter close to a letter picked by lot was exempted -- O happiest of rescues! -- from lunch for the day. From 8:15 in the morning, in other words, until 6:30 at night, on perhaps three days of every year, he was not obliged to set foot once in the dining hall. Instead, he was given a treasure chest: a paper bag containing a few potato chips, an apple, a bar of chocolate and -- the elixir that I can still taste, at 25 years' distance -- a six-and-a-half-ounce bottle of Coke.
1996-03-06	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;Coca-Cola's Olympic campaign to focus on the armchair athlete.	"BORROWING a marketing strategy from Norma Desmond, who in ""Sunset Boulevard"" plots her comeback to please ""those wonderful people out there in the dark,"" the Coca-Cola Company will focus much of an extensive and expensive campaign for the 1996 Summer Olympics on the fans rather than the athletes. ""For the fans"" will serve as the theme of broadcast, print and outdoor advertising for the company's flagship brand, the world's best-selling soft drink, which is called Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola elsewhere. That theme will also be included in promotional programs like one being co-sponsored by the NBC unit of the General Electric Company, which will broadcast the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta -- Coca-Cola's corporate home -- from July 19 through Aug. 4."
1996-03-05	Coca-Cola Expands An Agency's Role	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had further expanded its relationship with Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis by awarding that agency creative responsibilities for its Nestea Cool brand of iced tea, which had been handled in-house. The billings were not disclosed. Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the assignment this week in Adweek, adding that Fallon McElligott, which handles various projects for Coca-Cola, was awarded the assignment without a review. The agency's sibling shop in New York, Fallon McElligott Berlin, handles the Diet Sprite and Fresca soft-drink brands for Coca-Cola. Creative responsibilities for other Nestea brands remain at Edge Creative, the agency formed by Coca-Cola and the Walt Disney Company to handle products like Coca-Cola Classic that had been handled by the Creative Artists Agency.
1996-02-29	At Pepsi and Coke, New Marketing Steps	The Pepsi-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola Company are undertaking initiatives to help market their soft-drink brands. Pepsi-Cola, a unit of Pepsico Inc., is putting up its first World Wide Web site, Pepsi World (http:// www.pepsi.com/), which offers computer users interactive games, film previews, promotions and other features. The site was developed by Pepsi-Cola in cooperation with the Electronic Data Systems unit of General Motors in Plano, Tex., and two units of the Omnicom Group, the agency company that handles many Pepsico accounts: DDB Needham Interactive Communications and Tracy-Locke, a DDB Needham Agency, both of Dallas.
1996-01-26	Slight Drop In Coke Stock Despite Profit	Buoyed by surprisingly high beverage volume in the United States and on-target international growth, the Coca-Cola Company yesterday announced solid fourth-quarter earnings. Nevertheless, the stock fell as much as $2 during heavier-than-average trading yesterday, closing at $73.625, down $1.50. For the quarter, net income rose 14 percent, to $648 million, or 52 cents a share, from $567 million, or 44 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year, matching the expectations of analysts.
1996-01-24	Seeking consistency for a change, Pepsi plays off its 1995 campaign.	"THE Pepsi-Cola Company has spent most of this decade in seeming agreement with Ralph Waldo Emerson's assessment of consistency, disdaining it as the hobgoblin of little minds -- or perhaps of minds located in Atlanta. But the 1996 advertising for the company's flagship brands, which begins appearing on Sunday, strives to benefit from what has gone before. An initial batch of seven television commercials by BBDO New York, the longtime Pepsi-Cola agency, will reiterate the theme ""Nothing else is a Pepsi,"" which was introduced in January 1995. The spots, which will start during Super Bowl XXX and then run throughout the year, are again imbued with the edgy humor, youthful irreverence and pointed potshots at Coca-Cola that were characteristic of the pitches last year for Pepsi and Diet Pepsi."
1996-01-13	Coke Drops 'Domestic' and Goes One World	"Now, the Coca-Cola Company could adopt the song ""We Are the World"" as its corporate motto. The $10 billion company announced a basic shift in its world view yesterday, eliminating the very concept of a ""domestic"" and ""international"" Coca-Cola beverage business in the administrative structure of its worldwide operations."
1996-01-13	Politics Plays a Role At the African Cup	The war of words between South Africa's President, Nelson Mandela, and Nigeria's leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, has escalated. They are throwing soccer balls. Beginning Saturday, South Africa is to play host to the African Nations Cup, the most important soccer tournament held here since the end of apartheid-era sanctions. Joao Havelange, the president of FIFA, which governs world soccer, has made it clear that if the tournament goes well, he will back South Africa as host of the World Cup in 2006.
1996-01-12	New Diet Coke ads emphasize the 'Coke' rather than the 'Diet.'	"THE Coca-Cola Company is playing up the ""Coke"" in Diet Coke and playing down the ""Diet"" in a campaign that tries to present the product as a delicious soft drink without calories rather than a beverage to be consumed in medicinal doses by dutiful weight-watchers. Television commercials by Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, which begin appearing Monday, are aimed at men as well as women and celebrate youthful fun and playful exuberance -- just like campaigns for sugared soft drinks and the successful campaign that introduced Diet Coke in 1982. They are crowded with 20-somethings in leather, denim and the occasional tattoo; fire eaters, jugglers and roustabouts at a circus; parades led by big brass bands, and eclectic collages of barbers, boxers, cops and cowboys."
1995-12-24	INVESTING WITH;Elizabeth R. Bramwell: Bramwell Growth Fund	"AN earnings-led stock market at record highs is Elizabeth R. Bramwell's kind  of market, and she's making the most of it. 

     ""The macroeconomic picture is very constructive,"" says Ms. Bramwell, who from April 1987 through February 1994 led the Gabelli Growth Fund to annualized returns of 16.6 percent, half again the 10.8 percent advance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. This year, her Bramwell Growth Fund is up 31 percent as  of Friday, just shy of the 33.2 percent posted by the S.& P."
1995-12-24	EARNING IT;New Perk: Advice for Your Survivors	"LAST January, Rachel Eines's husband, a mechanic for General Electric, died unexpectedly at age 46. When a packet explaining his benefits arrived, Ms. Eines could not understand the financial and legal jargon. ""I didn't have the state of mind to read through it,"" she said. ""I don't think I'm a stupid person, but it was a little above me."" 

     Her two teen-age children, however, noticed in the material something about a benefit called Survivor Support. So Ms. Eines called G.E. and within days a financial counselor came to visit the family in their Bronx home. ""He was wonderful,"" Ms. Eines said. ""He sat with me and went through line by line like with a child, explaining it to me and telling me what he thought I should do. I'm gushing, but it was really a lifeline."""
1995-12-22	COCA-COLA EXPECTS SLOWER INTERNATIONAL GROWTH	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it expected international shipments to increase 5 percent in the fourth quarter, a smaller-than-expected gain. The news overshadowed board approval of a 2-for-1 stock split, the first in three years, and a $1.5 billion capital spending plan for 1996, the largest investment program ever for the world's biggest soft-drink maker. The forecast marks the fifth straight quarter of slower sales growth outside the United States, which accounts for about 80 percent of Coke's profit. Analysts had been expecting a 7 percent increase overseas for the quarter, less than last year's gain of 13 percent. Shares in Coke fell $1.50, to $72.75.
1995-11-25	New Delhi Journal;Fowl Fight Over Flies Sends India Into a Stew	Since health inspectors arrived two weeks ago at Kentucky Fried Chicken's first restaurant in the Indian capital and filed a report that was used to justify closing the outlet, wags here have had a name for the episode: the Tale of Two Flies. Other Indians are not sure whether to laugh or cry.
1995-11-22	Coca-Cola, Pepsico and Burger King sign on with Disney for a happy ending with 'Toy Story' tie-ins.	"THOUGH the big holiday film from the Walt Disney Company is titled ""Toy Story,"" the marketing strategy behind it is far from child's play. Disney is undertaking a huge promotional push to entice moviegoers to buy tickets for ""Toy Story,"" which opens nationwide today. Though the film is a full-length animated feature, a genre in which Disney excels, and advance reviews have been almost giddily enthusiastic, there is considerable risk. That's because ""Toy Story"" is the first such movie made by computer animation rather than the traditional cel-animation technique used for ""Aladdin,"" ""The Lion King"" and other huge hits."
1995-11-10	Coke Account Follows Ovitz to Disneyland	The Coca-Cola Company is shocking Madison Avenue again by forming a joint advertising venture with one of its biggest marketing partners, the Walt Disney Company. They will operate an agency with a single client, Coca-Cola, and a singular asset, an account with spending of more than $500 million annually around the world. The deal, announced yesterday, was brokered by Michael Ovitz, who left this summer as chairman of the powerful talent agency, the Creative Artists Agency, to join Disney as president. Coca-Cola stunned the advertising industry four years ago by hiring Mr. Ovitz -- often described as the most important man in Hollywood -- and Creative Artists to help reverse its then-flagging fortunes after a series of weak campaigns.
1995-10-31	Coca-Cola Project For Cliff Freeman	The Coca-Cola Company has broadened its agency roster by naming Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York to handle an undisclosed project. The company also said yesterday that it would award an additional assignment to a shop already on its roster, Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed reports of the assignments this week in Adweek. He said that Freeman, a unit of Cordiant P.L.C., was added to the Coca-Cola roster without a review, but declined to discuss the nature of its assignment. Adweek reported that the assignment could involve advertising for a two-liter plastic contoured bottle.
1995-10-20	Strong Growth in Sales Lifts Coca-Cola Earnings	The Coca-Cola Company said today that earnings rose 13.3 percent in the third quarter, lifted by strong growth in the volume of beverage sales in the United States and abroad. The company, the world's biggest soft-drink maker, said net income increased to $802 million, or 64 cents a share, from $708 million, or 55 cents a share, in the corresponding period in 1994. Revenue rose 9.7 percent, to $4.89 billion from $4.46 billion.
1995-10-04	Fresca Decides To Shift Agencies	"The Coca-Cola Company has moved the account of its Fresca citrus-flavored diet soft drink to Fallon McElligott Berlin in New York from Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York. The account, with billings estimated at $3.5 million, had been inactive since last year. Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the change this week in Adweek. ""This gives us the opportunity to put increased focus on Fresca,"" he said, adding that Lowe, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has grown busy with added responsibilities on the worldwide Diet Coke and Sprite accounts."
1995-09-21	Coca-Cola Expands Agency Roles	The Coca-Cola Company has expanded its relationship with three agencies on its roster for assignments including its interactive account. Martin Interactive, a division of the Martin Agency in Richmond, was named as the Coca-Cola worldwide interactive agency of record. The billings were not disclosed. Kerry Traubert, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the assignment this week in Adweek. Martin Interactive is working with David Wheldon, vice president and advertising director for Coca-Cola, on plans including promotion of the company's heritage on the Internet, she said.
1995-09-19	N.F.L. Sues Jones to Stop 'Ambush' Deals	"Jerry Jones and the National Football League are officially at war.

1995-09-13	Phasing Out a Soda	"The Coca-Cola Company will gradually phase out sales of its OK soda, which it started selling on a trial basis last year. A Coca-Cola spokesman, Randy Donaldson, said on Monday that the company had sold more than one million cases since its introduction in July 1994. That was not enough to keep the product going, he said. ""We just didn't generate the type of profitable volume we needed with OK, so we decided not to continue it in those test markets,"" he said."
1995-08-25	So Much Stock, but So Little Liquidity	Bill Gates as a broke technophobe? Only on Madison Avenue.

1995-08-15	Cowboys' Jones Issues (Pepsi) Challenge to the N.F.L.	Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, spends a lot of time thinking about how to make more money. But he claims that he is not making the kind of return that he wants on the $140 million investment he made in 1989 when he bought the team. No, not by a long shot. On Aug. 4, he created confusion in the National Football League, which counts Coca-Cola as an official sponsor and marketing partner, by replacing Coke as Texas Stadium's soda with Pepsi-Cola in a 10-year deal valued at a reported $40 million. Of the league's 30 teams, only the Cowboys and New England Patriots stadiums do not pour Coca-Cola. The Patriots have also signed with Pepsi.
1995-08-15	Ovitz Leaves a Legacy Of Jolting Madison Ave.	When Michael Ovitz, the chairman of the Creative Artists Agency, joins the Walt Disney Company, his second career, as a marketing strategist, will end. But he leaves a legacy in work for the Coca-Cola Company that will still serve to challenge traditional advertising agencies. Mr. Ovitz expanded the influence of Creative Artists, which was already the premier Hollywood talent agency, by advising giant consumer marketers like Coca-Cola. But at Disney, which he joins Oct. 1, he will focus solely on his duties as president, said Tom Deegan, a spokesman in Burbank, Calif.
1995-08-07	Dallas Cowboys' stadium ousts Coke, despite N.F.L. deal, and gives Pepsi 'pouring rights.'	"ON its face, it appeared to be yet another episode in the continuing ""Cola Wars"" between Coke and Pepsi, the world's largest soft-drink makers. Last Thursday, with the National Football League season opener just weeks away, Pepsi trotted out Jerry Jones, the maverick owner of the Dallas Cowboys, to announce that after 10 years with the Coca Cola Company, Texas Stadium, where the Cowboys have played their home games since 1971, was switching to Pepsico. At a news conference outside of the Cowboys preseason training camp in Austin, Mr. Jones kicked up his heels and flashed a pair of white leather cowboy boots tattooed with the Pepsi insignia, courtesy of Pepsi, and announced, quite unapologetically, that he would be ""drinking Pepsi, selling Pepsi and promoting Pepsi"" despite the league's agreement with Coke."
1995-08-03	International Briefs; Coca-Cola in Romania	The Coca-Cola Company has opened two new bottling plants in Romania, part of the company's $150 million investment in the country.

1995-08-01	Ties to Olympics For Two Big Names	The McDonald's Corporation is getting a head start on its sponsorship of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta by introducing a national Olympics promotion nearly a year before the Games begin. And the Coca-Cola Company has awarded an Olympics advertising assignment. Steve Bender, a spokesman for McDonald's, in Oak Brook, Ill., said this was the first time the company had begun a promotion so far in advance of an event, adding that it was part of a series of promotional and advertising programs tied to the Olympics.

The deal is expected to close this week. The deal had drawn criticism from other makers of soft drinks. Coca-Cola said in March that it would buy Barq's, which is based in New Orleans, for an undisclosed sum that was estimated by analysts to be as much as $85 million.
1995-07-31	Coke Strike in Ontario	The Coca-Cola Company's 400 Ontario employees went on strike after failing to reach a labor agreement, a union spokeswoman said.

1995-07-25	Nice-guy Sprite gets an attitude as Coca-Cola pursues irreverent, playful young consumers.	"UNTIL early last year, advertising from the Coca-Cola Company portrayed Sprite as being as sticky-sweet as its pixieish name. Now the Sprite persona has been revamped to naughty from nice, in a campaign that mocks the conventions of soft-drink marketing in a manner so bold and tough, consumers may well wonder whether the brand is being renamed Troll. Out went the syrupy jingle ""I like the Sprite in you"" and the strange fruit, the ""lymon,"" symbolizing lemon-lime flavor. To better appeal to core customers, thirsty teen-agers and 20-somethings, the ads have been imbued with spiky energy and a pervasive skepticism of traditional Madison Avenue promises."
1995-07-21	COCA-COLA CO. (KO,N)	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that profit rose 18.5 percent in the second quarter, meeting Wall Street expectations, as its international sales grew strongly.

Two of the biggest players in the exploding market for juices are the big rivals from the cola wars: Coke and Pepsi.

1995-06-05	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Computer screen savers are becoming the new billboards.	EVEN if marketing on the Internet ends up a cyberflop, Madison Avenue is downloading dollars another way: making computer screens an advertising medium. Screen savers, the software programs that fill otherwise idle monitors with images, are attracting sponsors and licensers eager for an efficient, inexpensive way to pitch products to, or ingratiate themselves with, computer users.
1995-06-01	To avoid a blending of agencies, three soft-drink brands are shifting their accounts.	TWO big beverage marketers took part yesterday in account switches for three leading brands -- Fruitopia, 7Up and Cherry Coke -- with billings estimated at more than $60 million.

The new spot will begin running next month in countries where Coca-Cola markets Diet Coke; Lowe continues as the Diet Coke agency.
1995-05-23	Coke Goes Better With I.B.M. Deal	"The Coca-Cola Company has come up with a new solution when its large customers like McDonald's or Hilton Hotels look to it for advice on how to put zip into their thousands of salad bars or execute the delicate art of ""menu re-engineering"": call I.B.M. Coke and I.B.M. said yesterday that the International Business Machines Corporation would provide exclusive consulting services to Coca-Cola's commercial customers looking to reduce labor costs, develop new food concepts, adjust their brand identities, or simply introduce new menus.

1995-05-12	Business as Usual in Kiev: By Taunt and Bribe	When the Kiev city government began building a six-lane highway through the parking lot of a modern, Western-managed office complex last month, the South African Ambassador to Ukraine, whose embassy is in the building complex, blocked the city's bulldozers with his Mercedes-Benz. The Ambassador, Deon van Schoor, said he was protesting the construction on principle -- city officials had ignored diplomatic agreements about embassies' rights to a security zone and, worse, had not bothered to give the building's tenants advance warning.
1995-05-11	Clinton Chooses Coke in Russia's Cola War	When President Clinton decided to make one detour from his Moscow summit-meeting agenda to publicize a successful American business investment in Russia, he chose Coke.

Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink maker, earned $638 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $521 million, or 40 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. The results slightly exceeded estimates of Wall Street analysts.
1995-04-18	Judge Dismisses Suit Over Soda Sweetener	A New York State judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against the nation's diet-soda manufacturers over their nonsugar sweetener, aspartame. The class action, filed last April, contended that the manufacturers had failed to notify consumers that aspartame can deteriorate in diet soda as quickly as 90 days after its manufacture. Such degradation could make the soda tasteless or, in some cases, leave it with a bad taste, the suit said, but it did not contend that a change in taste makes the beverages unsafe.
1995-04-16	TATS Cru Wins Coca-Cola Account	NATURE'S lighting was perfect on a recent afternoon as TATS Cru set out to create a mural for on the wall of a South Bronx discount store. Under a deep blue sky and a bright sun, the crew's three young men deftly manipulated spray-paint cans as easily as artists use brushes. A few hours later three red circles with the white trademark Coca-Cola signature inside had replaced the web of graffiti covering the wall. Piece of cake for three guys used to painting at night or in dark subway tunnels.
1995-04-13	New Ads Coming For Coke Classic	"The Coca-Cola Company will introduce six television commercials on Monday as part of continuing plans to release new work throughout the year for its flagship Coca-Cola Classic brand. Separately, the company has become a sponsor of the National Football League's initial foray onto the Internet. The ""Always Coca-Cola"" commercials, created by the Creative Artists Agency talent agency in Beverly Hills, Calif., join a series of spots created by ad agencies like Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London and Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis. One humorous commercial likens the inventions of the light bulb and Coca-Cola by showing Thomas Edison inspired by the soft drink; at the end, a voice cries out, ""Tom, turn off the light and come to bed."" A second spot features a Snippet, a novelty toy similar to a Chia pet; as the toy slurps Coke through a straw, grass sprouts on its head."
1995-04-11	Coca-Cola Broadens Its Agency Lineup	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had broadened its agency roster by naming Fallon McElligott Berlin in New York, a unit of Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, to handle the creative portion of its Diet Sprite brand account, and Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston to handle a promotional project for its Caffeine Free Diet Coke brand.

1995-02-26	Coke's Great Romanian Adventure	IN winter, this city takes on a particularly grim tone. The overcast skies, the leafless trees, the dirty buildings and the fine dust blowing in from the surrounding plains form a monochrome landscape that accentuates the poverty and struggle in the faces of so many people here. But a familiar color dots this veil of gray -- the red of Coca-Cola. It is the rare shop or kiosk in the capital here and throughout Romania that does not have a red circle poster with a Coke bottle in the middle, or a red awning, or red umbrellas, or windows lined in red stripes or red plastic cases stacked outside.

Coca-Cola is aggressively accelerating efforts to promote the attributes of the brand called Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola in more than 190 countries. Qualities like taste, the contoured Coke bottle and the red disk logo are even more prominently stressed than in the last two years, when the company successfully brought out the retro-chic campaign theme, ""Always Coca-Cola."""
1995-02-02	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about new diet cola advertising for the Coca-Cola Company referred incorrectly to the soft drink ranked No. 10 in United States sales, according to Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.

1995-01-08	World Markets; Schweppes and the Battle for King Cola	WHEN Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. released its last earnings report in September, the soft drink and candy company was bubbling over with optimism. Pretax profit was up by 23.2 percent for the first half of the year, the merger of A & W Brands into its beverage business in the United States had gone smoothly and unusually warm summer weather in Europe seemed to promise a strong sales increase for the second half of the year. But in the last few months, the fizz has gone out of Cadbury Schweppes, at least as far as investors are concerned. The stock, which rallied over the summer after having plunged along with the rest of the market earlier in the year, has fallen sharply again since September.

Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, the last agency to handle Five Alive, will continue to handle Coca-Cola Foods' Minute Maid and Hi-C brands. A campaign for Five Alive is expected to begin in the spring.

1994-12-09	Johannesburg Journal; Corporate Foe of Apartheid Finds Reward Elusive	After a decade of corporate homage to the anti-apartheid movement, Pepsi-Cola expected to enter South Africa in political and commmercial triumph -- the liberation soft drink. Unlike its arch-competitor Coca-Cola, which kept its brand in the South African market during years of trade sanctions against white domination, Pepsi pulled out in 1985 and stayed away until this year, when the black majority won the right to elect its own Government.
1994-12-07	As Fifth Ave. Changes, Disney May Replace La Cote Basque	In another indication that Fifth Avenue is no longer solely a preserve of luxury, the Walt Disney Company is planning to rent space there for a store selling merchandise tied to its movies and characters -- and in the process may displace the elegant restaurant La Cote Basque. The company is poised to sign a lease for about 30,000 square feet in the Coca-Cola Building at 711 Fifth Avenue, which the soft-drink maker took over when it bought Columbia Pictures in 1982. Under the plan, according to real estate executives, the Disney store would displace La Cote Basque as well as Goldpfeil and Bally of Switzerland, two high-end retail stores.
1994-12-06	Coke's Cans May Be Steel	"The Coca-Cola Company said today that it might switch to steel from aluminum cans because of the soaring price of aluminum. ""We're aggressively exploring the shift from aluminum to steel in certain parts of the world, specifically Europe and the Pacific Rim,"" said Randy Donaldson, a spokesman."
1994-11-11	Coke Adds to Operations Of Fruitopia Drink Unit	Intensifying the fruit-drink wars in one of the fastest-growing beverage categories, the Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday that it had invested $150 million to expand production of its Fruitopia beverage division and would introduce a new lower-calorie line of Fruitopia flavors as well. The investment has been used to purchase plants in Waco, Tex., and Northampton, Mass., the company said, and to upgrade the bottling lines in existing operations.
1994-11-08	A Reassignment For Coca-Cola	The Coca-Cola Company has confirmed the reassignment of one brand account but would not discuss the possible reassignment of a second. Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, yesterday confirmed a report this week in Adweek that the Martin Agency in Richmond, which handles the Mello Yello brand, had also been awarded the Mr. Pibb brand without a review. Billings were not disclosed. Mr. Pibb was at GSD& M Advertising in Austin, Tex., until that agency resigned its Coca-Cola assignments last year to become the Royal Crown Cola Company agency.
1994-10-21	Coca-Cola Adds Burnett to Roster	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had further widened its agency roster by naming Leo Burnett/Oslo, the Norwegian agency of the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, to handle responsibilities for five brands in Norway. Billings on the account, previously handled by McCann-Erickson Worldwide's agency in Oslo, Reklanens Hus McCann, were not disclosed. Leo Burnett/Oslo was chosen, without a review, to produce local adaptations of advertising for Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light -- the overseas version of Diet Coke -- Sprite, Fanta and Tab X-tra; it will also handle local marketing and promotional activities. It is the first time Burnett has worked for Coca-Cola.
1994-10-21	COCA-COLA CO. (KO,N)	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its earnings jumped 20 percent in the third quarter, its biggest quarterly increase in four years. Net income rose to $708 million, or 55 cents a share, from $590 million, or 45 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. The 1993 quarter included a one-time gain from the reversal of a reserve for litigation. The results matched analysts' estimates.
1994-10-04	Pepsi Venture By Ex-Officer Of Coca-Cola	Ian R. Wilson was passed over in 1980 for chairman of the Coca-Cola Company, which selected Roberto C. Goizueta instead. Yesterday, with a touch of revenge, Mr. Wilson joined executives from Pepsi-Cola at a news conference in New York promoting Pepsi and its return to South Africa as a product in sync with the new politics of a country it left in 1985 amid concern over sanctions. Mr. Wilson, a white South African who joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in 1956 and rose to become vice chairman, even tried to vilify Coca-Cola as having established its dominance in the $1 billion soft-drink market in South Africa under the rules of the old regime.
1994-09-29	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday about an investment by the Coca-Cola Company in Russia misspelled the surname of a senior vice president of the company. He is E. Neville Isdell.

Net sales for the quarter, that is domestic and foreign together, are expected to grow by 12 percent, the company said. Still, the company also affirmed earlier estimates by analysts that it would earn 55 cents in the third quarter."
1994-09-18	Coca-Cola Monopoly Is Protested at Rutgers	"A university's effort to soften the impact of budget cuts by awarding a $10 million, 10-year exclusive contract to Coca-Cola has not only angered Snapple and Pepsi fans, it has also raised suspicions about the corporate presence on campus. When Rutgers University announced its intention to provide Coca-Cola with exclusive rights to sell its products on campus, administrators heralded the plan as ""a creative solution to long-term problems."
1994-08-30	Coke and Nestle Revise Iced Tea, Coffee Accord	The long-simmering iced-tea wars heated up again yesterday when the Coca-Cola Company and Nestle S.A. announced an agreement to restructure their struggling three-year-old joint venture in ready-to-drink iced tea and iced coffee. The world's largest beverage company and the world's largest food company, which have jointly distributed Nestea and Nescafe, have taken a pummeling in the most recent market surveys, placing a distant third to the Snapple Beverage Corporation as well as to a joint venture of Pepsico and Thomas J. Lipton.

Mr. Ivester was also elected to the board of directors by the 13-member group, which met yesterday for an hour and a half.
1994-07-19	COCA-COLA CO. (KO,N)	Buoyed by emerging-market sales in India, China, the Middle East and Latin America, the second-quarter earnings of the Coca-Cola Company grew 11.8 percent, the company said yesterday.

Buffett bought another 1.57 million shares of the Coca-Cola Company in June, bringing his holdings in the giant beverage company to 94.97 million shares, the Washington Service, a news agency, reported yesterday.

1994-07-10	Snapple Challenged in Wide Market	"THE way that Arnold Greenberg likes to tell it, Snapple Beverages first product was carbonated apple juice, produced in a small plant upstate in 1978.

""When it first came out,"" Mr. Greenberg, a founder and executive vice president, recounted, ""we sold 500 cases. The next month we sold 500 more cases and got some calls from distributors. 'You've changed your formula,' they said. 'This Snapple's tasting better and better.'"

The soft-drink company, based here, said it would spend an undisclosed amount to buy a South African company, National Beverage Services, which has provided marketing and technical services to Coca-Cola's bottlers."
1994-06-16	Beleaguered Cott's Shares Plunge	The Cott Corporation, the Canadian bottler of private-label soft drinks that has mesmerized the stock market with its marketing gains in recent years, now has the short-sellers on its tail. Its shares fell $4.875 (Canadian) today, to $20.125, on the Toronto Stock Exchange, a decline of 20 percent. Early last week, the stock was trading above $30. The company's stock also plummeted today in the United States, falling $3.50 (United States), to $14.50, in Nasdaq trading.
1994-06-08	AFTER 16 YEARS, COCA-COLA RETURNS TO NEW DELHI	Coke was reintroduced yesterday in New Delhi, 16 years after the Coca-Cola Company left India. The company said it had begun distributing its soft drink in the capital from four renovated bottling plants around the city. Coca-Cola is expected to return to Bombay next week; it has already been reintroduced in parts of Punjab, in northern India, and in Calcutta. The Indian subsidiary of Coca-Cola was the leading beverage concern in the country when the company shuttered its operations rather than comply with Government directives to dilute ownership and disclose its secret formula.
1994-06-07	Pepsi and South Africa To Get Together Again	Pepsi-Cola International announced yesterday that it would return to South Africa, nine years after selling its beverage business there in response to international economic sanctions. In a bid to compete against Coca-Cola, Pepsi has formed a joint bottling venture in which black investors from the United States hold a majority stake, according to the company.
1994-05-20	Coca-Cola Reaches Into Impoverished Albania	Dirt-poor Albania has hardly an economy to speak of, but as of today it has Coke. The average wage is less than $30 a month. Its main export is its unemployed, with an estimated 300,000 Albanians working abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy, and sending money home.
1994-05-18	New Campaigns From Cola Giants	Two of the world's largest soft-drink brands are introducing significantly revamped advertising campaigns. The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would begin running new advertising for Coca-Cola Light, as Diet Coke is called in 30 countries overseas. This will be the first time the brand has been marketed as a distinct product.
1994-05-17	Soda Industry Tries to Avert A School Ban	"Lobbyists for the soft-drink industry told a Senate committee today that Congress should not restrict the sale of Coca-Cola and similar beverages in schools because the soft drinks had a place in a well-balanced diet. ""To suggest that there are good foods and bad foods -- we reject that entirely,"" said Drew M. Davis, vice president of the National Soft Drink Association. ""You have no evidence that the consumption of soft drinks is in any way harmful."""
1994-05-08	SUNDAY, May 8, 1994; Indiana Cool	Product placement -- companies paying a product's way into movies, television shows and magazines -- has taken a new form in Indiana. The state recently dedicated an official historical marker in Terre Haute at the birthplace of the original green, contoured Coca-Cola bottle, which has since become the shape known round the world. The bottle shown above (a reproduction) was designed by the Root Glass Company in 1915 to be instantly distinguishable from other bottles by sight or feel, whether whole or broken in pieces on the pavement. It won a Coca-Cola contract for Root, although the shape that actually went into production was a bit slimmer.
1994-04-26	Ultrathin models in Coca-Cola and Calvin Klein campaigns draw fire and a boycott call.	AN organization is urging marketers to renounce the use of overly thin models because, its founders charge, such images encourage starvation diets and eating disorders. The group, and the publicity it has already drawn, raises again the contentious issue of advertising's ability to influence behavior. The name of the organization, formed by women in the Boston area, some of whom suffered eating disorders, describes its purpose: Boycott Anorexic Marketing. It seeks to curtail the practice of featuring waif-like, wafer-thin models in ads for a variety of products by identifying companies considered to be culprits and asking consumers not to buy their wares.
1994-04-26	Senator, Promoting Student Nutrition, Battles Coca-Cola	"It may be true, as the advertising slogan says, that things go better with Coke. But school lunch is not one of them, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee said today. The chairman, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, has introduced a bill that would encourage schools to restrict or ban the sale of soft drinks and other items of ""minimal nutritional value."""
1994-04-13	Coke Plans 'Red Hot Summer'	"The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would team with the Fox Broadcasting Company, the Ford Motor Company and more than 250 radio stations across the country for its largest promotion ever, called ""Red Hot Summer."""
1994-04-01	Grass-Roots G.O.P. Group With Big-Company Backing	A nonprofit offshoot of the Republican Party that was formed last year to seek the ideas of ordinary Americans is being financed by big corporations and millionaires whose donations are not subject to Federal restrictions that apply to most political groups. Since its creation last June, the organization, the National Policy Forum, has been criticized by groups that monitor campaign finances because it has refused to disclose the identities of its donors.
1994-03-31	Pepsi-Cola to Stamp Dates For Freshness on Soda Cans	For decades, marketers have managed to convince American consumers that they had problems they never knew were problems -- halitosis, body odor, coffee nerves, dishpan hands, even bad breath in dogs -- and then peddle them solutions. Now the Pepsi-Cola Company seeks to add to that list a most unlikely problem, staleness in sodas. Beginning tomorrow, Pepsi, the nation's No. 2 soft-drink maker, will sell Diet Pepsi with freshness dates emblazoned on can bottoms, indicating the contents are best if used in 12 to 14 weeks. Freshness dates will soon follow on all other Pepsi brands, including the flagship Pepsi-Cola.
1994-03-26	Japan Says Coke Owes More Taxes	"Japanese tax authorities today accused the Coca-Cola Company of under-reporting its income in Japan and they demanded payment of more than $140 million in back taxes, interest and penalties. Coca-Cola's Japanese subsidiary immediately said it would appeal. ""We pay our taxes in full,"" said Robert Harland, a spokesman."
1994-03-20	The Prose That Refreshes	"It seemed that Coca-Cola's new product was a drink. But that would have been silly. Who needs another soft drink? What Sergio Zyman, Coke's chief marketing officer, actually said in New York when he announced Fruitopia (italics and ellipses from Coca-Cola transcript) made more sense. ""What is our new product announcement? Let me answer that question by saying that it's not so much a product . . . as it is an attitude . . . an attitude about what people want from their beverages."""
1994-03-08	Official's Pay at Coka-Cola	The chairman of the Coca-Cola Company, Roberto C. Goizueta, earned about $3.79 million in 1993, including salary, bonuses and other compensation. Mr. Goizueta's base salary was $1.45 million and his performance bonus was $2.2 million, a total increase of 14 percent, according to the company's proxy statement filed today at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also received $138,724 in other compensation, including benefits.
1994-03-02	Coca-Cola's 'Alternative' Beverages	The Coca-Cola Company doesn't often give products names like Grape Beyond, Total Fruit Integration, Strawberry Passion Awareness or Citrus Consciousness. And it certainly isn't known for bottling products in slightly ragged labels festooned with flowers or selling them from vending machines decorated in psychedelic colors. All that may be uncharacteristic for staid, tradition-minded Coca-Cola, but the marketing strategy is a familiar one: a giant hopes to mimic the success of innovative entrepreneurs like, in this case, Snapple Beverage.
1994-02-23	Diet Coke's Redesign; A Splashy New Look, With a Hint of Nostalgia	"Seems it just wasn't right to have a new advertising campaign with the same old tired look for the product. So in keeping with Diet Coke's ""This is refreshment"" theme now abundantly familiar to those watching the Winter Olympics from Norway, cans of Diet Coke around the world will soon reflect their first design change in more than eight years."

The Atlanta-based company, the world's largest soft-drink maker, raised its quarterly dividend to 19.5 cents a share, up from 17 cents. The dividend increase will be paid on April 1 to shareholders of record on March 15. The company's shares rose 37.5 cents, to $41.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
1994-02-11	London Shop Hired By Coca-Cola Unit	Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland has followed in the footsteps of its American parent by hiring a shop not affiliated with its longtime agency company, the Interpublic Group of Companies. Bob Bertini, a spokesman for the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, confirmed reports in British advertising trade publications yesterday that Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London had been hired to handle unspecified special projects.
1994-02-08	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Despite mixed reviews, Coke's quirky campaign commands an encore.	THE Coca-Cola Company, a year after shocking Madison Avenue with the most risk-taking, rule-breaking advertising ever for its flagship brand, signaled its continuing commitment to the campaign by introducing a second generation of commercials that are as unconventional as their precursors. The campaign, with a global budget estimated at more than $600 million, has been one of the most contentious in advertising. It has been castigated for a perceived lack of focus and brand-building characteristics, yet also praised for shaking up the tired traditions of Coca-Cola and soft-drink advertising.
1994-02-07	New Vietnam Combat: Coke vs. Pepsi	In what seems the realization of the worst nightmare of a generation of dedicated Vietnamese Communists, the Vietnam War has now given way to the opening volleys of the Cola War. In the first days after a 19-year-old American trade embargo against Vietnam was lifted, most large American consumer products companies are still nowhere to be seen here. Their people are not yet in place; their advertising campaigns are still weeks away.
1994-02-05	Vietnam Welcomes U.S. Decision on Embargo	In the crowded streets of a city still better known to the world as Saigon, there was a sense today that the war was finally over, the last battle concluded half a world away in the corridors of the White House. The news that President Clinton had decided to lift the American trade embargo against Vietnam reached here today shortly before dawn, and by breakfast it was the only topic of conversation to be found in much of Ho Chi Minh City, the city that the Americans had to flee in humiliation a generation ago.
1994-01-28	"""COCA-COLA CO. (N)"""	The Coca-Cola Company attributed the increases of 20 percent in its fourth-quarter earnings and 33 percent for the full year to growth in the company's bottling operation investments and increases in domestic and international soft-drink sales. Domestically, case sales to retail customers grew by 5 percent during the fourth quarter, compared with the comparable period a year earlier, while sales of syrups and gallon shipments decreased by 6 percent because there were five fewer shipping days in the latest quarter.
1994-01-13	Advertising; Coke Adds Life to Its Diet Coke Ads	"Naughty, sly, sexy, titillating and playfully self-referential advertising from Coca-Cola rather than Pepsi-Cola? How refreshing. It is no coincidence that a major campaign introduced yesterday for Diet Coke, carrying the theme ""This is refreshment,"" is uncharacteristically infused with those Pepsi-esque attributes. The ads for America's leading diet soft drink are the first since the Coca-Cola Company rocked Madison Avenue in October by replacing Lintas New York, the agency that had handled Diet Coke since its introduction in 1982, with Lowe & Partners/SMS on the estimated $70 million account."
1993-11-30	Ruling on Coke and Tri-Star	The Delaware Supreme Court ruled today that Coca-Cola Inc. mistreated minority shareholders of Tri-Star Pictures Inc. in the 1987 merger of Tri-Star with Coca-Cola's Entertainment Business unit. The court reversed the Delaware Chancery Court on four substantive counts and sent the six-year-old case back to the lower court for trial.
1993-11-10	Coca-Cola Reassigns 3 Beverage Brands	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had further widened its agency roster by realigning responsiblities for three of its brands. As expected, Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., was named to handle advertising for the Cherry Coke brand, which had been previously inactive but at McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York. Also, McCann's Powerade sports drink account moved from its New York office to the agency's Seattle office.
1993-10-25	Chiat/Day May Get Cherry Coke Account	The Coca-Cola Company is moving closer to awarding its Cherry Coke brand to Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif. Advertising executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity said on Friday that although the discussions on the assignment had not been completed, Chiat/Day seemed likely to join soon the widening roster of Coca-Cola agencies, which expanded earlier this month to include similarly unconventional creative shops like Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., and Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis.
1993-10-14	Coke Gives More To Creative Artists	The Coca-Cola Company has awarded the Creative Artists Agency another assignment for its flagship Coca-Cola Classic brand, this one involving advertising for the 1994 World Cup. Creative Artists, the Beverly Hills, Calif., talent agency that has assumed lead creative responsibilities on the Coke account from McCann-Erickson Worldwide, the brand's advertising agency, will produce ads promoting the World Cup, which will be held for the first time in the United States. Coca-Cola is an official corporate sponsor of the world soccer championship.
1993-10-11	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A shake-up of agencies by Coca-Cola may be just the beginning of a wider 'Ideas Wanted' push.	"TWO advertising agencies known for risk-taking, rule-breaking creativity have been selected by the Coca-Cola Company to work on special projects for the soft-drink giant. The regional midsize agencies Coca-Cola added to its official roster of shops on Friday specialize in campaigns with hip, contemporary points of view. One is Fallon McElligott of Minneapolis, which humorously dramatizes the difficulties of wearing too-tight jeans for Lee. The other is Wieden & Kennedy of Portland, Ore., which helps Nike wage the sneaker wars by urging the world to ""Just do it."""
1993-10-06	Lintas Loses Diet Coke's Account After 11 Years	The Coca-Cola Company rocked Madison Avenue yesterday by moving its main Diet Coke account from the advertising agency that helped introduce the brand with great success in 1982. The account for Diet Coke advertising in English-speaking countries, estimated to be worth $95 million in annual billings, was moved from Lintas New York to Lowe & Partners of New York.
1993-09-09	2 London Executives Take New Positions	Prominent executives at two London agencies have been appointed to new positions. Chris Jones, executive vice president of agency operations at the J. Walter Thompson Company in London, was promoted to managing director for multinational accounts. Mr. Jones, 38, will continue his management responsibilities for Thompson's Kellogg account, adding worldwide responsibilities for the agency's Unilever, Nestle, DeBeers and Rolex accounts.
1993-08-31	One Marketing Unit at Coke	After years of having separate global and domestic marketing efforts, the Coca-Cola Company has combined its marketing division into one unit. The consolidation was presented to senior Coca-Cola officials in a memorandum circulated through the Atlanta headquarters on Thursday by Sergio Zyman, who returned to the company last month as its first chief marketing officer.
1993-08-17	In a rebuke from the client, Lintas must compete in a creative shoot-out to keep the Diet Coke account.	THE Coca-Cola Company is unofficially reviewing its estimated $95 million Diet Coke account, entertaining ideas from seven shops including Lintas New York, the agency for the brand since it was introduced in 1982. Advertising executives, who spoke yesterday on condition of anonymity, confirmed a report this week in the trade publication Advertising Age about the unusual creative shoot-out.
1993-08-15	Viewpoints; A Brief History of Coca-Colonization	"IT'S May 1991 at the headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta.

They join another executive watching CNN nearby. ""Well,"" mutters the other executive. ""That's not too good for us."""
1993-08-05	Success of first-time jingle writers shows how Coca-Cola has changed its tune creatively.	"IN writing commercial jingles, as in any career, you can't beat breaking in at the top. That was the happy fate of Terry Coffey and Jon Nettlesbey, young producers and songwriters who, with Michael Hudson, an executive producer, created ""Always Coca-Cola,"" a crucial element in the soft drink's eponymous 1993 advertising campaign."
1993-07-27	COCA-COLA TO SELL MERCHANDISE BY CATALOGUE	The Coca-Cola Company is set to send out a 32-page catalogue in the United States to market more than 400 products emblazoned with its trademark logo -- from golf balls to clothing, jewelry to a hand-restored Coca-Cola delivery truck from the 1920's.
1993-07-23	Coke Takes the Fizz Out of Campaign Doomsayers: For Now, at Least, It's 'Always Coca-Cola.'	"AS soon as the Coca-Cola Company announced on Wednesday that Peter S. Sealey was resigning as the senior vice president to create his own marketing consulting firm, speculation arose that officials of the company might have grown dissatisfied with its ""Always Coca-Cola"" campaign, which Mr. Sealey had helped coordinate with Creative Artists Agency. Clever as the advertisements may be, the talent agency's unconventional two-year association with the soft-drink company has failed to energize the domestic cola market. The market share for Coca-Cola Classic, the jewel of the company, has held steady at about 19.5 percent for almost three years, according to John Maxwell of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, and sales of diet cola in general have slipped this year."
1993-07-22	Coca-Cola Names Marketing Officer	"The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta said yesterday that it had named Sergio Zyman to the new position of chief marketing officer. He will assume responsibilities of Peter Sealey, who announced that he was resigning as senior vice president and director of global marketing to open his own marketing consulting business, effective Aug. 20. Mr. Sealey, 52, who has been with Coca-Cola on and off for 24 years, assumed his last position nearly three years ago and is known for his work on Coca-Cola's ""Always"" campaign. Mr. Sealey will open his new shop, Peter Sealey & Associates, in Atlanta and San Francisco."
1993-07-07	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Coke takes a bearish approach to its new winter campaign.	THE Coca-Cola Company has more news that Madison Avenue might find hard to, you should pardon the expression, bear. It was bad enough, traditional agencies have growled, that a Hollywood talent agency wrested creative control over the Coke brand's 1993 global advertising campaign from McCann-Erickson Worldwide, its longtime shop. Now the soft-drink giant says it intends to make one of the commercials from that unorthodox campaign the centerpiece of its winter marketing plans.
1993-05-30	Coca-Cola's New Logo	"WHAT: A new (old) logotype for the Coca-Cola Company's flagship brand, called Coca-Cola Classic in the United States and Canada and Coca-Cola in the rest of the world. Internally, the logo is known as ""the red disk,"" ""the bull's eye"" or the ""trademark disk."" It is intended to serve as the symbol for ""Always Coca-Cola,"" the advertising campaign that the soft-drink giant introduced in February. WHERE: All over, from bottles and cans to lapel pins. The logo, fairly widespread already, will become nearly ubiquitous with the onset of summer, the peak period for soft-drink consumption."
1993-05-24	New Awards For Creativity	Established brands and new talent will be honored by two organizations as they create awards to recognize achievement in marketing and advertising. Absolut, Coca-Cola and Nike will become the first brands to be named to the new Marketing Hall of Fame, the New York chapter of the American Marketing Association said last week. The organization's Effie awards are bestowed annually in recognition of effective advertising; honorees for the Hall of Fame will be drawn from brands that have shown sustained success and represent innovative, trail-blazing marketing. The three brands will be honored at the organization's 25th anniversary Effie awards ceremony in New York on June 10.
1993-05-21	Coke to Spend More On Its Classic Brand	"The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would increase spending on its ""Always Coca-Cola"" campaign for Coca-Cola Classic by more than $21 million this summer and fall because of what it called ""the initial success of the campaign."" The campaign has been intensely followed since it began in February because it marked the first time that a Hollywood talent agency, the Creative Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, Calif., had been given the lead role in creating ads for a giant consumer brand. In a statement, Charles B. Fruit, the vice president of global advertising and media services at Coca-Cola, said the levels of awareness for the campaign ""are running very high."" Initial research also showed what the company called ""statistically significant increases"" in factors like the intent to purchase and likability. The company did not release the figures from the research."
1993-05-05	COMPANY NEWS	CADBURY SCHWEPPES P.L.C., London, said that Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages Ltd. had signed an agreement with the Perrier U.K. unit of Nestle S.A. for the exclusive distribution rights for Perrier products in Britain. NEW PLAN REALTY TRUST, New York, said it had purchased two shopping centers, one in Kentucky and another in Indiana, for $18 million in cash.
1993-04-28	Lintas Looking For Creative Change	Lintas New York is interviewing a number of high-level creative executives to work on accounts like Diet Coke and I.B.M., F. Stone Roberts, president and chief operating officer, said. Mr. Roberts was replying to reports this week in trade publications that the agency was looking for a creative talent to assume the duties of creative director on Diet Coke from Tony DeGregorio, executive vice president and chief creative officer.
1993-04-27	Coke Plans to Buy 30% Stake In Mexican Soft Drink Unit	The Coca-Cola Company announced today that it would spend $195 million to buy a 30 percent stake in the soft drink operation of Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A., the Monterrey-based company that holds Coke's biggest foreign franchise. The move raises Coca-Cola's stakes in what has become one of the most important theaters of its global struggle with Pepsi-Cola International. Mexico's per-capita cola consumption is second only to that of the United States, and the nation's thirst is expected to grow for years, with or without ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
1993-04-14	Coca-Cola Co. (N)	The Coca-Cola Company reported strong results yesterday for the first quarter. Operating profit increased 18 percent, to $454 million; per-share earnings advanced 21 percent, to 35 cents. The increase in earnings does not take into account adjustments to accommodate charges of $146 million for post-retirement benefits and $73 million for equity investments.
1993-04-09	COCA-COLA SHARES FIRM AFTER FALLING TO A LOW	"Shares of the Coca-Cola Company fell yesterday to a 52-week low but recovered a bit after the company said it was buying back as much stock as it could. Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, Roberto C. Goizueta, said that the stock's recent swoon has created ""the buying opportunity of the decade."""
1993-04-06	Coke Selling Three Units To Bottler	The Coca-Cola Company said today that it had agreed to sell three bottling companies, including its Dutch subsidiary, to its largest domestic bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., for $360 million. Marking its first international foray, Coca-Cola Enterprises signed a nonbinding agreement to buy Coca-Cola Beverages Nederland B.V. The Atlanta-based bottler also agreed to buy the Roddy Coca-Cola Bottling Company and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Johnson City, Tenn. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 44 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, has failed to produce consistent profits in its six-year history. Analysts said the growing international markets served by the Netherlands operation could provide a lift. 'Vehicle for Future Growth' Roy D. Burry, a Kidder, Peabody analyst, said the United States soft-drink market had slowed down and that the international market provided greater opportunity for growth.
1993-04-05	Poachers on Ad World's Rich Terrain	The West Coast has become the land of the advertising carpetbagger. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency run by Michael Ovitz, has produced 27 commercials for Coca-Cola (one of which may become a situation comedy), struck a deal with Nike and initiated talks with the American Express Company about an event-marketing program. Now, International Creative Management, another of Hollywood's largest agencies, is poised to get involved in advertising, as well.
1993-03-18	Corrections	An article in Business Day on March 10 and a report in the Business Diary column last Sunday about the 1991 compensation of Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, characterized the public reaction to his pay package incorrectly. Mr. Goizueta's compensation drew attention in news articles but no protests from Coca-Cola stockholders.
1993-03-10	Coke Trims Pay Package Of Chairman	The Coca-Cola Company has apparently told Roberto C. Goizueta, its lavishly compensated chairman and chief executive, that there are limits to the company's generous definition of largess. Mr. Goizueta piloted Coke through a difficult year in 1992, one dominated by recessions at home and abroad. Nevertheless, operating income rose by nearly 18 percent, creating $1.4 billion in shareholder wealth.
1993-02-25	Coca-Cola Will Expand Into the Interior of China	The Coca-Cola Company expanded its status as the world's leading producer of soft drinks this morning by signing an agreement in Beijing with the Chinese Government to build or upgrade 10 bottling plants in the interior of the country. The deal will enable Coca-Cola to move well beyond the coastal regions of China, where it has had a relatively strong presence, and build what it hopes might eventually become one of its largest national markets.
1993-02-24	COKE AND BOTTLER SEEKING FOREIGN EXPANSION	The Coca-Cola Company and the bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said yesterday that they were involved in discussions aimed at expanding bottling operations overseas. Neither company would say which foreign markets were being considered. Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta as is Coca-Cola, is the soft-drink maker's largest bottler, distributing 53 percent of its bottle and can sales in the United States. Forty-four percent of its stock is owned by Coca-Cola. Last year, Coca-Cola's international sales grew twice as fast as domestic sales -- 4 percent versus 2 percent, respectively.
1993-02-19	Coke Promotes 2 Executives, Stirring Talk of Succession	The Coca-Cola Company named two senior vice presidents yesterday, creating apparent front-runners for the job of chief executive. Coca-Cola said the executives, John Hunter and M. Douglas Ivester, would report directly to Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman and chief executive, who is 61.
1993-02-17	Agency for Coca-Cola once more finds itself without a creative leader for the huge account.	HELP WANTED: Dynamic creative executive to develop breakthrough work for world's best-known product. Must be willing to share responsibilities, on unprecedented basis, with novice drawing rave reviews for initial work. High turnover in post; predecessor had five-year contract but left early -- very early. Six-figure annual salary would buy gallons of Coca-Cola syrup to soothe upset stomach. Contact McCann-Erickson Worldwide, New York. THOUGH McCann-Erickson is unlikely to place such a classified ad, the vacancy described is, in Coca-Cola parlance, the real thing. The agency is again searching for someone to handle the creative duties on its crucial soft-drink account after dismissing Gordon Bowen.
1993-02-16	Coca-Cola Denies Larger C.A.A. Role	"As excited as the Coca-Cola Company is about the results of its unprecedented collaboration with a Hollywood talent agency in the creation of its advertising, a top executive says the assignment involves just the company's flagship Coca-Cola/Coca-Cola Classic brand. ""Right now, their total focus is Coca-Cola,"" said Peter S. Sealey, Coca-Cola's senior vice president and director of global marketing. His reference was to the Creative Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, Calif., which has assumed an extraordinarily comprehensive role in Coca-Cola advertising, much to the discomfort of the brand's longtime agency, McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York."
1993-02-11	Advertising; Coca-Cola's New Campaign Shakes Up Madison Avenue	What happens when the world's most famous brand shakes up Madison Avenue by hiring Hollywood's most powerful talent agency to collaborate with its longtime advertising agency? If the initial results are any indication, the ad-making process could be in for significant and systemic changes. At a news conference yesterday in New York, the Coca-Cola Company introduced the 1993 campaign for its flagship brand, called Coca-Cola Classic in America and Coca-Cola in 195 other countries. The campaign is as extraordinary for who created and produced it as for its unexpected freshness, breadth and playfulness.
1993-02-10	COKE SIGNS ACCORD AND MAY BOTTLE IN VIETNAM	The Coca-Cola Company has signed an agreement with Vietnam that could lead to the establishment of bottling operations there. Coca-Cola said yesterday that it had entered into the agreement with a Government-controlled food and produce company, Vinalimex, and with the Chuong Duong beverage factory, a one-time Coca-Cola bottler. In December, the United States eased restrictions on doing business with Vietnam. Shares of Coca-Cola lost 37.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $40.75
1993-02-10	COMPANY NEWS: Hiding Places for Drugs; Why Coke in Cans Annoys Coca-Cola	At first blush, one would think the Coca-Cola Company would be flattered to have a likeness of its soft-drink cans used as a shell for a small safe. After all, Coca-Cola is widely regarded as the world's most valuable brand, and its stock is generally considered a safe bet. But the soft drink giant has taken exception to a California company that turns Coke cans into safes, because many consumers apparently use them to hide illegal drugs. The Atlanta-based beverage giant has charged California Safe, based in Van Nuys, Calif., with seven counts of trademark infringement in a suit filed in United States District Court here.
1993-01-29	Coca-Cola Co. (N)	"The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that heavy holiday sales helped lift fourth-quarter earnings. Strong foreign demand, aided by price increases at the end of 1991, was largely responsible for record profits for all of 1992. ""The fourth-quarter results benefited from volume growth, which became progressively better as the calendar moved from October through December,"" Roberto C. Goizueta, Coca-Cola's chairman, said in a statement."
1993-01-27	COCA-COLA RESUMING REGULAR SALES IN SAUDI ARABIA	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would resume regular sales in Saudi Arabia after 25 years. The announcement appeared to mark the formal end of an Arab boycott against the Atlanta-based company imposed in 1967 in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli war. Arab League nations barred several major American corporations that had business ties with Israel from their countries. Coca-Cola has been imported into Saudi Arabia in limited quantities since the boycott was eased in 1989. Under a new agreement, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite will be produced in cans and post-mix at the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Saudi Arabia.
1993-01-12	COKE INTRODUCES PLASTIC VERSION OF 'CLASSIC' BOTTLE	The Coca-Cola Company yesterday introduced a plastic version of its 78-year-old distinctively contoured bottle. The 20-ounce recyclable plastic bottle is on shelves in Birmingham, Ala., and Chattanooga, Tenn. The Atlanta-based beverage concern plans to stock both classic Coca-Cola and diet Coke in the new bottle on shelves across the country soon. The company contended that its contoured bottle was the most recognized consumer package in the world. It will support the introduction with television, radio, print and outdoor advertising.
1993-01-10	Companies' Offers of Scoreboards Raise Questions for Schools	"WITH state aid to education declining and costs increasing, Long Island school districts are looking more and more to private enterprise for help.

In recent years the aid has been in the form of discounts on, or donations of, computers, software, sporting goods, apparel, equipment and other types of sponsorship, all of which offset costs that would otherwise force cancellation of programs or be borne by taxpayers."
1992-12-15	Coke Adds a Clear Cola To Its 'New Age' Stable	"The Coca-Cola Company introduced a new clear diet cola yesterday to counter the recent foray by its archrival, Pepsi, into so-called New Age beverages with Crystal Pepsi. But Coca-Cola declined to anoint a clear Coke and reached to one of its second-tier brands in naming its newest drink: Tab Clear. Coca-Cola rented the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan yesterday to announce its ""truly out-of-the-world news,"" and the hyperbole never abated. With bluster characteristic of the cola wars, Coca-Cola executives called Tab Clear the ""ultimate diet soft drink"" and declared that confronting Pepsi's challenge with a clear Coke would have been ""aiming too low."" 'Clear Coke' Shunned Doug Ivester, president of Coca-Cola's North American soft drink business, also suggested that attaching the Coke name to a clear beverage was never a possibility, in light of the brand's cola heritage. ""Clear Coke is an oxymoron,"" he said."
1992-11-08	Tell Me Your Cola and I'll Tell You Your Party? Well, Not Quite	"To the Editor: ""Presidential Pop and Circumstance"" (The Week in Review, Nov. 1) connects Coca-Cola with Democratic Presidents and Pepsi with Republicans. The political history of cola drinks is far more mixed. The first major skirmish of the cola wars came in 1907, when the father of the Pure Food and Drug Act, Dr. Harvey Wiley, vowed to put the Coca-Cola Company out of business. Wiley suspected Coca-Cola contained cocaine. When he found the drug had been removed from the secret formula, he attacked the caffeine in Coke."
1992-11-01	Cola Coattails Presidential Pop And Circumstance	"COME Tuesday, Americans will be voting for more than just a President. They will also be selecting a soft drink. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater may have dismissed the relatively youthful Clinton-Gore ticket as ""The Pepsi Boys"" and said the Republicans ""have the real thing,"" but history suggests that he's got the wrong one, baby, unh-unh."
1992-10-16	Madison Avenue Is Feeling The Heat From Hollywood	"""HOORAY for Hollywood"" has not supplanted ""Can't Beat the Real Thing"" as Coca-Cola's commercial jingle. Yet the soft-drink giant is becoming increasingly convinced that a powerhouse California talent agency can offer as much, if not more, expertise in advertising as its mainstay New York ad agency. That startling development, which the Coca-Cola Company confirmed for the first time last week, is fascinating other advertisers and other agencies. They are keenly following Coca-Cola's unprecedented experiment in dividing creative responsibilities for a huge worldwide campaign, due next spring, promoting its flagship brand, called Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola elsewhere."
1992-10-15	Coca-Cola Earnings Up 18.5% in Quarter	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that third-quarter profits increased 18.5 percent, despite cold weather that hurt the soft drink industry's sales and weak economies in important markets. Earnings were $540.6 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $456.3 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues climbed 11 percent, to $3.51 billion from $3.17 billion.
1992-10-09	Creative Artists Gains at Coca-Cola	For the first time, the Coca-Cola Company has discussed the process involved in creating the global campaign to be introduced next spring for its flagship Coca-Cola brand. Its disclosures indicate that the Creative Artists Agency has gained a far more influential role in that process that initially believed. C.A.A., the Beverly Hills, Calif., talent agency led by Michael Ovitz, was named last year as a creative consultant to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, the brand's longtime flagship shop. C.A.A.'s hiring was a signal that Coca-Cola was beginning to seek ideas from sources other than McCann and McCann's parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies. That is important because the move has encouraged other agencies to hope they might loosen Interpublic's grip on Coca-Cola's estimated $367 million in billings.
1992-09-23	Coke Chooses An Ad Agency	Coca-Cola U.S.A. said yesterday that the Atlanta office of its flagship agency, McCann-Erickson, had been awarded the advertising account for Nordic Mist, the new line of flavored sparkling water aimed at younger consumers. Billings were not disclosed.
1992-09-23	With Sales Flat, Coke Has Clear Plan	Against the backdrop of a gloomy third-quarter sales forecast made to analysts yesterday in New York, the Coca-Cola Company is going New Age. Following a host of competitors, Coke announced plans yesterday to sell Nordic Mist, a flavored sparkling water.
1992-08-13	In-House Move By Big Coke Bottler	"Coca-Cola Enterprises has decided upon an in-house consolidation of its local media planning and buying, a spokeswoman said yesterday, confirming a report this week in Inside Media. The decision means that responsibilities for more than $50 million in annual billings will be relinquished by McCann-Erickson in New York, which has handled those duties from regional offices in cities like Los Angeles. The spokeswoman, Laura Brightwell, said the decision was made to conform with previous practices at the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, which merged with Coca-Cola Enterprises in December and whose executives now run the company. She added that it had ""absolutely no bearing on McCann's relationship with the Coca-Cola Company,"" for which the agency creates campaigns for brands like Coca-Cola Classic. The Coca-Cola Company is a minority owner of Coca-Cola Enterprises."
1992-07-30	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Coke Imports Overseas Ads For the Olympics Broadcasts	USUALLY, when consumers don't understand what is being said in a television commercial, the agency responsible can expect to lose the account. A series of spots running during NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics, however, are intended to create just that effect. The spots, which will appear through the end of the Games on Aug. 9, were produced by McCann-Erickson in New York for the Coca-Cola U.S.A. division of the Coca-Cola Company, the largest Olympic advertiser.
1992-07-29	Coke Dips Into On-Line Advertising	"The Coca-Cola Company, in its initial foray into advertising on an on-line, interactive computer service, is sponsoring an ""Olympic Preview"" on the Prodigy network, an effort meant to complement the soft-drink marketer's extensive advertising and promotional programs tied to NBC's broadcast of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The program, which continues through Aug. 9, when the Games end, includes same-day Olympic results and statistics, a trivia contest and, of course, ad messages."
1992-07-24	New Spots Are Set For Diet Coke, Pepsi	"Two soft-drink marketers are introducing big, splashy television commercials involving celebrities, some living and some dead. The singer and dancer Paula Abdul performs some fancy footwork in a spot for Diet Coke by Lintas New York, the second that weaves clips from vintage films with contemporary live-action footage. In the spot, which begins running on Tuesday after a ""teaser"" campaign, Ms. Abdul dances with Gene Kelly (as he appeared in ""Anchors Away"" and ""On the Town"") and Groucho Marx (""Duck Soup""). Cary Grant watches (""The Awful Truth""), then pours Ms. Abdul a Diet Coke (""Indiscreet"")."
1992-07-21	COKE PLANS BUYBACK OF 100 MILLION SHARES	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its board had authorized the repurchase of 100 million shares over the next eight years. The announcement supported Coke's shares on a day of broad declines in the stock market in which the Dow Jones industrial average fell 28.64 points. Coke stock closed up 12.5 cents a share, ending at $41 in yesterday's New York Stock Exchange trading. The share repurchase program has a $4.1 billion value at yesterday's closing price.

1992-07-15	Coke's 2d-Period Net Grew, But Shipments Were Weak	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that second-quarter net income advanced 20 percent despite weak shipments in important markets, including the United States, Japan, Brazil and Mexico. Despite the sharp jump in profits, Coke's shares dropped 62.5 cents yesterday, closing at $41.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. While earnings matched analysts' expectations, Coke's shipments of concentrate to bottlers were lower than expected.
1992-06-04	Optimism On Soccer TV	"ABC and ESPN, which will televise the 1994 World Cup, along with MasterCard International, Coca-Cola and M & M/Mars, which will sponsor the telecasts, are convinced of one thing: those who participate in soccer and those who attend games will watch the World Cup because it is the World Cup. At yesterday's announcement of the ABC-ESPN partnership with the three sponsors, each party sounded a similar note. ""We're convinced that when our country sees the event on their soil, it will be a tremendous success,"" said Steve Solomon, senior vice president of ABC Sports."
1992-06-04	Corrections	A brief article in Business Day on Monday about Coca-Cola's plans in Eastern and Central Europe misstated its investment intentions. In the next three years the company plans to invest nearly $1 billion in the region in addition to what it has already committed.
1992-06-03	New Coke Vienna Base	As part of a plan to invest nearly $1 billion in Central and Eastern Europe in the next three years, The Coca-Cola Company yesterday opened headquarters in Vienna for its operations in the region.
1992-06-01	Coke Move In Europe	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it planned to invest nearly $1 billion in Central and Eastern Europe by the end of 1995. The company made the disclosure in conjunction with the opening of a soft-drink bottling plant in Gdynia, Poland. Most of the investments were previously announced, including plans to spend $450 million in the eastern part of Germany. But Coke, based in Atlanta, said yesterday that it planned to nearly double its investment in Poland, to $200 million.
1992-05-08	Coke and Pepsi Skirmishing In Restaurant Trade Press	COKE and Pepsi are at it again. In the latest skirmish, Pepsi is firing back at claims by Coke that it is self-destructive for restaurants to serve Pepsi. The Coca-Cola Company has effectively persuaded many restaurant chains that buying Pepsi's soft drinks is a way of subsidizing a fearsome competitor, since Pepsico is one of the world's biggest restaurant companies, with more than 21,000 Taco Bells, Pizza Huts and Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets.
1992-04-25	Coca-Cola Turns From Talk To Contest With Gatorade	"The Coca-Cola Company has apparently decided that it would rather fight the mighty Gatorade than join it. Gatorade sales have reached nearly $1 billion a year worldwide, attracting the attention of the nation's three largest soft-drink makers. Yesterday, in an effort to make the competition sweat, Coca-Cola USA said it planned to begin selling its sports drink, Powerade, in bottles and cans next month in four cities in the South. Despite the limited introduction, Coke said it was ""making a major commitment"" to sports drinks."
1992-04-22	Pepsi and Coke Set Nutrasweet	The Pepsi-Cola Company said it had a signed a long-term agreement for the Nutrasweet Company to continue to supply aspartame for sweetening its soft drinks.

1992-03-19	Coke's Chief Paid a Million Shares in '91	If Roberto C. Goizueta wants to buy the world a Coke these days, he certainly has the means. As the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, Mr. Goizueta received an enviably lavish compensation package last year. The centerpiece was a million shares of restricted stock, which, as of yesterday's close on the New York Stock Exchange, had a value of $81 million.
1992-03-17	Warner Music, NBC And Coke in Deal	The Warner Music Group, NBC and Coca-Cola yesterday announced a summer promotional program tied to NBC's telecast of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, of which Coca-Cola is a major sponsor.

1992-02-21	Coke Payout Up	The board of the Coca-Cola Company, buoyed by a 17 percent increase in 1991 earnings, raised the quarterly dividend on common stock by 17 percent and voted to recommend a 2-for-1 stock split to stockholders, the company said. The beverage company raised the quarterly dividend to 28 cents from 24 cents, raising the annual payout to $1.12. The action marks the 30th straight year in which the company has increased dividends. The increase is payable on April 1 to stock owners of record March 15. Coca-Cola shares closed at $79.125, up $2.125, today on the New York Stock Exchange.
1992-02-03	Completion Set For Coke Sign	Passers-by in the Times Square area could be excused for thinking that scaffolding is a permanent part of Coca-Cola's spectacular new billboard there. But the sign, which cost the soft-drink company more than $3 million, is expected to be fully operational in a couple of weeks, the Coca-Cola Company said. Since the sign was unveiled during a live television commercial on New Year's Eve, workers have been tinkering with its most unusual feature, a fiber-optics display inside a 42-foot-high bottle of Coke. When that feature works, a giant straw pops up and down as the fiber optics simulate a level of liquid inside the bottle that rises and falls, revealing the bottle's Coke-green color.
1992-01-31	Coca-Cola's Earnings and Stock Climb	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit had risen 22 percent, driven by strong sales overseas and a pickup of sales in the United States, and its stock jumped nearly 8 percent. The company also said it planned to recommend a 2-for-1 stock split to its board at its February meeting. The split, if approved, is expected to be effective in April or May.
1992-01-30	Coke in Ireland	The Coca-Cola Company announced plans for a $45 million expansion of a concentrate plant in Ireland and the establishment of Coca-Cola Reinsurance Services Ltd. in Dublin. The expansion of the plant in Drogheda, about 25 miles north of Dublin, will create more than 140 jobs in the next five years and should be completed by 1993. The company said Coca-Cola Reinsurance would provide reinsurance for the company's properties outside the United States and Canada.
1992-01-24	Coca-Cola Begins 24-Hour Campaign	Beginning at 6 this morning, Eastern time, the Coca-Cola Company will sell around the clock, in its first 24-hour global television advertising bombardment.

The hoopla is tied to the initial lighting of the Coca-Cola Company's $3 million, three-dimensional sign at 2 Times Square, where Broadway and Seventh Avenue meet at 47th Street. The company will give away soft drinks, in souvenir cups, to those visiting 17 neighborhood restaurants, and will run two commercials during ABC's ""New Year's Rockin' Eve,"" with Edward I.

The nation's largest soft-drink marketer and its archrival, Pepsi-Cola, have used the Super Bowl as a showcase for special commercials. Pepsi has indicated that it plans to run commercials, each of which will cost $850,000 per 30-second spot, during the game on Jan. 26.
1991-11-26	The New Official Drink At Shea Stadium: Coke	Effective with next year's baseball season, the Coca-Cola Company will replace the Royal Crown Cola Company as the advertiser and soft-drink supplier at Shea Stadium in New York, Coca-Cola and the New York Mets said yesterday. Coke will erect signs in the stadium, run ads in the Mets' yearbook and support promotional programs, said James Ross, the Mets's vice president of marketing.

1991-11-25	Coke Escalates Cola Wars In International Campaign	THE COCA-COLA COMPANY is introducing advertising campaigns that shift the focus of its sales pitches from the United States, where it is under fire from Pepsi-Cola, to the world, where it outsells Pepsi 4 to 1.

1991-11-21	Coke's World View -- A special report.; For Coke, World Is Its Oyster	For many companies, globalization proves to be a concept as empty as that other corporate buzzword, synergy. But for the Coca-Cola Company, the process of going global is now so extreme and rapid that its business in the United States has become secondary. Indeed, because profit margins, sales growth and untapped potential are all much greater overseas than at home -- and competition from Pepsico Inc. is milder -- the decline in the relative importance of the United States to Coke seems irreversible. Thus, by the end of the decade, the United States may account for no more than 10 percent of the profits of this quintessentially American company, several analysts say.
1991-11-17	Corrections	A report on the Business Diary page last Sunday about the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. misstated the sales ranking of the companies' soft drinks in the United States. Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi.
1991-11-15	Rexene, Awash in Debts, Turns Up as Golf Sponsor	William J. Gilliam, chairman of the Rexene Corporation, has walked tall as a deal maker on Wall Street, especially after he and some employees of Drexel Burnham Lambert led a buyout of the Dallas-based petrochemical company in 1988, then took it public four months later at a huge profit. But last month, Rexene, which Mr. Gilliam has headed since the buyout, crash-landed in a Delaware bankruptcy court in a way that made it more than just another victim of too much debt piled atop an inefficient, cyclical business.
1991-11-15	New Giants in Times Square Light Brigade	"TIMES SQUARE is about to get a sizable infusion of new neon. The array of illuminated billboards that have dominated the Manhattan crossroads for decades have been joined by two gigantic electric advertising signs, for the South Korean conglomerate Samsung and the Japanese whisky Suntory. And on New Year's Eve, a third, for Coca-Cola, is scheduled to join them. The trio of multimillion-dollar signs, on a building at Duffy Square called 2 Times Square, might at first light seem like souvenirs of a quaint era typified by a Planters sign, with its cascading peanuts, urging passers-by to buy ""a bag a day for more pep."""
1991-11-14	Corrections	A chart in Business Day last Thursday about revenues from beverages for the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. described the figures incompletely. The domestic figures for Pepsico included revenues from bottling and distribution; the domestic figures for Coca-Cola did not.
1991-10-23	Market Place; Coke vs. Pepsi As an Investment	"COKE and Pepsi are often compared on taste and on the potency of their advertising, as people did recently when Pepsi introduced a new logo. But how do the companies compare as investments? ""They are two different animals,"" said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco. Other experts also view the two companies as a study in contrasts."
1991-10-17	Coca-Cola Profit Up 15.8% On Strong Overseas Sales	Bolstered by strong sales overseas, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday, profits rose 15.8 percent in the third quarter. Earnings rose to $456.3 million, or 69 cents a share, it said, compared with $394.1 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier, while sales increased 13.6 percent, to $3.17 billion, from $2.79 billion a year ago.
1991-09-24	On a Roll, Pepsi Changes Its Face	Pepsi-Cola unveiled its new face yesterday, a logo that the company hopes will make it seem peppier and younger than its age-old rival. The new logo, with streamlined blue letters suspended over what looks like a rolling tri-colored beach ball, comes as Pepsi attempts to press home a series of public relations victories over Coca-Cola intended to capture the attention of the nation's youngest consumers.
1991-09-17	Coke's Tab Diet Drink Is on Comeback Trail	Tab, once the nation's best-selling diet soft drink, is being tested for a comeback. Mal MacDougall, the chairman of the MacDougall Company, New York, yesterday confirmed a report in this week's issue of the trade publication Adweek that the Coca-Cola Company had hired his agency to produce advertising for Tab.
1991-09-05	Coke Sees Marketing Help Of Hollywood's Top Agent	In a highly unusual and somewhat mysterious move, the Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday that it had hired Creative Artists Agency Inc., Hollywood's most powerful talent agency, to help Coca-Cola mold its marketing and media strategies around the world. While both companies described their new relationship in only general terms, Coca-Cola executives said Creative Artists and its increasingly influential chairman, Michael S. Ovitz, would help Coca-Cola develop long-term strategies and present a unified message to consumers in the 107 countries where it does business.
1991-08-20	MOSCOW AND THE MARKETS: Kremlin Shake-Up Jars the Financial World; Ambitions for Soviet Deals Are Suddenly Placed on Ice	The march of foreign private investment into the Soviet Union seemed to freeze mid-stride yesterday, as business executives watched the events in Moscow with confusion and concern, struggling to decipher what the shift in leadership means for their own fledgling ventures there. At least one major project, the planned privatization of the Soviet automobile ministry through a possible deal with Fiat, the Italian auto manufacturer, has been put on hold, said Alan Siegel, a New York lawyer who has been representing the ministry in the negotiations.
1991-08-14	For Coke (Without Asking), Free Advice on Marketing	THIS summer, advertising executives have been talking about Coca-Cola almost as much as they have been drinking it. Much of their chatter is about a flurry of ad and marketing changes at the Coca-Cola Company, involving top executives and possibly the creative content of its campaigns. The prevailing sentiment among cola cognoscenti seems to be that changes in the marketplace have caught up with the nation's soft drink sales leader. Moreover, while Coke still outsells Pepsi, some advertising experts are saying that the Pepsi-Cola Company now looks to be out-marketing its archrival.
1991-08-06	D.M.B.&B. Presentation To Coke Is Confirmed	An advertising executive confirmed yesterday that D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, New York, recently made a presentation for the advertising account of the Coca-Cola Company's fountain business. An article in this week's issue of the trade publication Adweek reported that Coca-Cola had invited D.M.B.& B. and Ogilvy & Mather, New York, to make a presentation for the account. While Ogilvy turned down the offer because it handles Pepsi-Cola overseas, Adweek reported, D.M.B.& B. accepted.
1991-08-01	Advertisers Get Ready For the Football Season	"With the football season near, advertisers are introducing campaigns heavy on the pigskin and on tie-ins with the National Football League. Sealy Inc., the mattress maker, began television commercials yesterday for its campaign, ""N.F.L. hit the sack bonus blitz,"" with a new spokesman, a sleepy Sealy salesman who snoozes on a mattress while football players block, pass and tackle around him. Leo Burnett U.S.A., Chicago, created the spot."
1991-08-01	2 Coca-Cola Executives to Retire	The Coca-Cola Company yesterday announced the retirement of two longtime senior officers and said their responsibilities would be taken over by other longtime Coke executives. Ira C. Herbert, who is 63 years old and executive vice president of Coca-Cola, as well as president of its North America business sector, plans to retire on Dec. 31. He has been with Coke since 1965. John W. Georgas, 63 years old and executive vice president of Coca-Cola, as well as president of its international business sector, will retire that same date. Mr. Georgas joined the company in 1974.
1991-07-30	Spielvogel-Coke Meeting	The two top executives of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, New York, flew to the Atlanta headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company yesterday to make an unusual advertising presentation to the soft drink giant. It was unusual because Backer is not a Coca-Cola advertising agency. McCann-Erickson Worldwide, New York, is the agency of record for the company's flagship Coca-Cola Classic brand, which brings McCann an estimated $300 million in annual billings in the United States and 70 other countries.
1991-07-24	BUSINESSES AVOID SOUTH AFRICA TIES	Despite President Bush's recent decision to lift economic sanctions against South Africa, most American companies that once owned businesses there say they have no plans to return soon, if at all. Some companies that sold their businesses in South Africa, like the Coca-Cola Company, moved important operations to neighboring countries like Swaziland, and say they can serve the South African market from there.
1991-07-23	Coca-Cola Product	"The Coca-Cola Company is reintroducing its Cherry Coke and Diet Cherry Coke after two years of flat sales for the cherry-flavored versions of its two most popular soft drinks. The new ""fountain-style"" colas have stronger cherry taste than their predecessors, which came out in 1985. The revamped products are being advetised in newspapers, on billboards and in radio commercials as ""Now cherrier than ever."" McCann-Erickson is the Cherry Coke agency."
1991-07-19	Coke Plans 5th Avenue Retail Store	The Coca-Cola Company is hoping consumers consider shopping as refreshing as a cold soft drink. In November, Coca-Cola will open a store on Fifth Avenue between 55th and 56th Streets that sells clothing, toys, memorabilia and other items that bear its famous red-and-white logos.
1991-07-18	Coke's Net Up 17.7% In Quarter	"The Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest maker of soft drinks, reported yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 17.7 percent, to $482.4 million, or 72 cents a share, from $409.9 million a year earlier, or 61 cents a share. The results were in line with, or slightly better than, analysts' expectations and showed Coca-Cola's continuing strength abroad, where its competitors, especially Pepsico, are relatively weak. Revenue rose 11 percent, to $3.04 billion, from $2.74 billion a year earlier. Coca-Cola's shares rose 50 cents yesterday, to $58.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. A Promising Summer Cited ""This was a very good quarter"" for Coca-Cola, said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst who follows the company for Paine Webber. Moreover, June sales were strong, indicating a promising summer. Hot weather stimulates soft-drink sales, and Mr. Goldman noted that there seemed to be a heat wave developing in Europe, where Coca-Cola has some of its strongest and most profitable business. Mr. Goldman estimated that volume of soft drinks sold abroad by Coca-Cola, especially Europe and Japan, grew about 8 percent during the quarter. That compares with slower growth of 3.5 percent in the United States, where soft-drink consumption is the highest in the world. Moreover, Coca-Cola's domestic sales were lifted somewhat by special circumstances, including an 11 percent rise in fountain sales at restaurants, partly a result of Coca-Cola's winning the huge Burger King account last year. By contrast, sales of cans and bottles, where Pepsi is a strong competitor in supermarkets, rose only 1 percent in volume in the quarter, Mr. Goldman estimates. A Reserve Fund for Litigation The company held in reserve 2 cents a share, or $13.3 million, from its earnings, for what Coca-Cola called ""potential one-time charges"" related to 10-year-old litigation by Coke bottlers. Earlier this month, a Federal court ruled in the company's favor against a small group of bottlers that contended Coca-Cola was gouging them on the price of concentrate for Diet Coca-Cola. But the court, while ruling against most of the claims, said that the bottlers were entitled to a refund for certain sugar sweeteners bought by the bottlers between 1980 and 1987. ""The litigation has been going on for time immemorial,"" Mr. Goldman said. ""The potential charges are very minor."""
1991-07-17	Trade Is Rumored at Coke: Air Jordan for Mr. Robinson	Can anyone fill Michael Jordan's sneakers? Maybe not in playing basketball or selling shoes, but the up-and-coming David Robinson might get the chance to see if he can do as well in pitching soft drinks. The advertising and marketing industries have been abuzz for the last month with talk that Mr. Jordan will soon halt his two years of endorsements for the Coca-Cola Company for a more lucrative, longer-term deal to swallow Gatorade for the Quaker Oats Company. Until now, no one has suggested whom Coca-Cola might sign to replace the Chicago Bulls superstar.
1991-07-04	For King Center in Atlanta, New Leader and New Focus	The center founded to carry on the work and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. today announced the hiring of a Harvard University administrator as its new executive director, a shift in focus and $1 million in new corporate financing. Two years after Dr. King's son, Dexter Scott King, was installed amid great fanfare as executive director only to step down four months later, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change Inc. here named Ronald L. Quincy, associate vice president and assistant to the president of Harvard, as its new executive director.
1991-06-20	Coke-to-G.M. Shift Is Set At McCann	"SEAN FITZPATRICK, the advertising creative executive who produced the Chevrolet ""Heartbeat of America"" campaign, was named to an important new assignment yesterday at the McCann-Erickson Worldwide agency, where, among other duties, he will handle worldwide advertising for the General Motors Corporation. Industry executives who were familiar with details of Mr. Fitzpatrick's appointment before it was announced said the move could also have reverberations beyond G.M., involving two other advertising giants: Coca-Cola and American Express."
1991-05-17	Coke in Indonesia	The Coca-Cola Company said it plans to open a bottling company in Indonesia to take advantage of increasing demand for soft drinks there. Coke will own 49 percent of the new venture, the Coca-Cola Tirtalina Bottling Company, a joint venture with the Tirtalina Group of Indonesia. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Coke has been available in Indonesia since 1932. The company said that the annual per capita consumption of Coke products by Indonesia's 182 million people was four servings, compared with 292 servings in the United States. Coke also announced preliminary plans to form a second joint venture company with the Indonesian Pan Java Group.
1991-05-07	Pepsi Plans Campaign On 'Chill Out' Theme	"This summer, as Coca-Cola pitches hot pop music, Pepsi-Cola will chill out. The Pepsi-Cola Company is scheduled to disclose on Sunday details of the summer 1991 promotion for its flagship Pepsi-Cola brand. Called ""the Pepsi Summer Chill Out,"" the promotion is already the subject of teaser television commercials by BBDO Worldwide, New York, the Pepsi agency. One spot shows a family watching television in a living room in Oak Brook, Ill. -- interestingly, the home of the McDonald's Corporation, the No. 1 fountain account for Pepsi's archrival, Coke."
1991-05-06	Arabs Adding Maxwell To Company Blacklist	The Arab League said today that it had lifted an official boycott of the Coca-Cola Company but imposed one on businesses owned by the publisher Robert Maxwell because of his dealings in Israel. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, was on the league's blacklist of companies doing business with Israel for more than 20 years. But it had been unofficially removed from the list two years ago. Egypt, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have allowed bottling plants to be opened, and Coca-Cola sponsored a World Youth Soccer tournament in Saudi Arabia in 1989.
1991-05-03	Coke's Splash in Eastern Germany	"Wolfgang Schulze was running a ramshackle soft-drink plant in a former Weimar brewery when East Germany's Communist system crumbled last year. Now, he is overseeing construction of a fully modern bottling plant for one of capitalism's flagships: the Coca-Cola Company. 

Mr. Schulze's swift conversion from Communist bureaucrat to technical director of the Weimar plant is no accident. It is a result of Coca-Cola's agility and resourcefulness in making a big move into the eastern German market. While most Western companies remain reluctant to dip into the economically troubled region, the soft-drink giant plunged in even before German unification. Now, Coke plans to spend $450 million over the next two years, one of its largest foreign investments anywhere to date."
1991-04-18	Record Coke Earnings On Strong Sales Abroad	The Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest soft-drink maker, yesterday reported a 13.2 percent earnings increase in the first quarter, to a record $320.9 million. Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said the results were slightly better than most analysts had expected. The strong performance was attributable to Coca-Cola's international business.
1991-04-14	Making a Difference; Pepsi Takes On Coke at the Fountainhead	For years, Pepsi-Cola has been making great strides in selling its soft drinks in supermarkets. Not so in the fountain business, where Coca-Cola still dominates the little gurgling machines that spew out syrup and fizzy water in places like McDonald's and Denny's. Richard Routhier, Pepsi's senior vice president for national sales, is trying to change that. In the past several weeks, Mr. Routhier and his salespeople have snagged a pair of plum Coke accounts: Howard Johnson's and the Marriott Corporation.
1991-03-16	Marriott Account Lost; Coke Cites Loan Denial	"The Marriott Corporation's food service business switched from Coca-Cola to Pepsi-Cola after Coke rejected the hotel operator's request for a loan of up to $100 million, a Coca-Cola Company memo shows. In the memo, a Coca-Cola senior vice president, Charles Frenette, who is head of Coca-Cola's fountain business, said approving a loan to Marriott would be unfair to other customers. ""In effect, they were asking us to become a banking business,"" Mr. Frenette said in the letter to fountain divisions employees."
1991-03-13	A Coke Bottle Uses Recycled Plastic	"The Coca-Cola Company's North Carolina bottling operation began a limited market introduction here of the first soft drink bottles made with recycled plastic. The 2-liter bottles of Coca-Cola Classic are made with a blend of 25 percent recycled plastic and 75 percent ""virgin"" resin. The new bottle, announced by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola last year, is the result of new technology that breaks down plastic polymer into its original components, then regenerates the purified resin for use in making new bottles. This is the first time the United States Food and Drug Administration has allowed recycled plastic to be used in food packaging."
1991-03-06	Coke-Sony Promotion	The Coca-Cola Company and the Sony Corporation announced yesterday that they planned to give away 5.6 million miniature compact audio disks with 6-packs and 12-packs of Coca-Cola beverages. Coke declined to say how large an advertising and promotion budget it had set for this year's promotion, scheduled to begin in May, but it is expected to total in the tens of millions of dollars.
1991-02-14	Return of Fresca	The Coca-Cola Company began the national introduction of the reformulated Fresca, a low-calorie citrus-flavored drink. Fresca, first introduced in the 1960's but later withdrawn from the national market because of low sales, was reformulated in 1985 and has been available only in some areas. The expanded distribution will take place over the next six months, Coke officials said, and will be accompanied by radio and print advertising.
1991-02-12	Coca-Cola Prices $200 Million Issue	The Coca-Cola Company yesterday priced $200 million in notes due Feb. 15, 1996, through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The noncallable notes have a 7 3/4 percent coupon and are offered at a price of 100, to yield about 38 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. According to underwriters, the issue is rated Aa-2 by the Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
1991-02-06	Eastern Germany Part of Coke Plan	The Coca-Cola Company plans to buy bottling and distribution plants in eastern Germany. The agreement in principle with Treuhandanstalt, the state agency charged with privatizing industry in the formerly Communist country, and new capital investments will bring Coca-Cola's investment to more than $450 million, the company said at a beverage conference here. Donald R. Keough, Coca-Cola's president and chief operating officer, said he believed the commitment was the largest single new investment in eastern Germany outside the automobile industry. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, began selling in eastern Germany last February. The German market produced about 11 percent of the company's profits last year.
1991-02-05	Coca-Cola's Earnings Drop 61.1%	The Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest soft-drink company, said yesterday that because of large one-time gains a year earlier, its fourth-quarter earnings dropped 61.1 percent. But operating earnings rose 27.1 percent. Strong international sales, especially in Germany and Japan, Coca-Cola's most profitable markets, contributed to the rise. Three of every four dollars in Coke's net income comes from abroad.
1991-01-29	The Game, a Nail-Biter; the Ads, Well . . .	THE Super Bowl game Sunday night was the most exciting one in recent years, but as the premier advertising event of the year it fell far short of the mark, some agency and marketing executives said yesterday. The executives said the Super Bowl's marketing cachet was marred by low overnight Nielsen ratings, a bungled contest that Pepsico was forced to cancel and by Coca-Cola's last-minute decision to scale back the advertising for a $1 million promotional giveaway.
1991-01-28	Coke Softens Super Bowl Ads	"The Coca-Cola Company toned down its commercials during the Super Bowl yesterday because of the war. The company had intended to broadcast several humorous ads for its ""Crack the Code"" promotional contest, in which $1 million was given away. Instead, Coca-Cola pulled the original commercials for Diet Coke and announced in two subdued advertisements that the promotion, as planned, was inappropriate during a war. The ads also saluted American service men and women in the Middle East and said the company would donate $1 million to the U.S.O. Coca-Cola did conduct the contest in its last Super Bowl ad, but without fanfare. ""Given the seriousness of the situation, we just decided not to run the original ads,"" said Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca- Cola. ""We had said we were keeping our options open, and decided at the end of the week to change it."" The $1 million giveaway was supposed to be broadcast during an elaborate halftime show sponsored by Walt Disney World and Coke. But the halftime show was pre-empted for the most part by ABC News. Coca-Cola, which had bought a minute and 45 seconds of advertising time from ABC, also gave back 15 seconds to the network. Super Bowl time had cost $800,000 for 30 seconds."
1991-01-07	Coke and Pepsi Square Off In the Super Bowl of Colas	Viewers of the Super Bowl game on Jan. 27 will find another battle off the field. Coke and Pepsi are going head-to-head for the first time, with multimillion-dollar contests that viewers can play by watching advertising just before or during the broadcast on ABC.
1990-12-23	Alton Journal; In Deaths of Children, Lives Are Transformed	The two buildings stand next to each other on the cramped, scruffy plot of land. One is a weather-worn shack of rotting wood and decaying paint. The other is a suburban fantasy of blond brick, with newly planted shrubbery along a fresh concrete path and the name Regalado arching over the front door in stained glass. The shack is where the Regalado family used to live, before the accident. The house is where they live now, because of the accident. If the two buildings stood any nearer to each other they would overlap, and their closeness is a wordless testament to what this family, and this entire town, have been through in the last 15 months: lawsuits and settlements, riches and resentments.
1990-12-21	Coke Bottler Move	Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said it had finished one stock buyback and was starting another. The company said it had repurchased about 1.5 million shares from public shareholders and the Coca-Cola Company in the fourth quarter, completing a two-year program to buy back 25 million shares. The bottling company, which is 49 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, said its board had also approved a new program to repurchase up to 15 million common shares. It said Coca-Cola would participate in the repurchase program to maintain its ownership at 49 percent.
1990-12-19	Diet Coke Spot For Super Bowl	"For next month's Super Bowl, Diet Coke is rolling out its most full-blown undertaking this year with its ""Crack the Code"" promotion, a series of interactive ads during which consumers can use their television screens to unscramble hidden messages found on game pieces from specially marked products. The zenith of the promotion will be a 60-second ad at halftime, which will help viewers figure out whether they have won the $1 million grand prize. Diet Coke's agency is Lintas New York."
1990-12-10	"THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Mattel Lines Up Partners In New Coupon Campaign"	"TWO Christmases ago, Mattel shot off a barrage of nearly 600 million coupons through the mail, offering $1 to $5 off the price of toys like Barbie and Hot Wheels. While bringing the promotional methods of the supermarket industry to the toy store was innovative, the response of consumers was less than overwhelming. 

""It was a major step forward in toys, but we've learned a lot,"" said Tom Romig, senior vice president for marketing services and entertainment at Mattel, the nation's second-largest toy maker, after Hasbro."
1990-12-05	Pepsi and Coke to Offer Recycled-Plastic Bottles	Coke and Pepsi took their long rivalry to the environmental arena yesterday, with each company saying it would be the first to sell soft drinks in plastic bottles made with materials recycled from used bottles. The recycling programs are set to begin next year and if successful might eventually reduce the amount of the plastic that ends up in the nation's landfills. They might also encourage more communities to set up recycling programs, by putting more cash in the pockets of companies that collect recyclable material. Both companies said recycling would not affect the cost of their products.
1990-11-30	Coke and Nestle Plan Coffee and Tea Drinks	"Nestle S.A., the world's largest food and coffee company, and the Coca-Cola Company, the world's largest soft-drink company, said yesterday that they were negotiating a joint venture to make and market coffee and tea drinks under the Nestle Nescafe and Nestea brand names. The venture would be owned and financed equally by Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, and Nestle, which is based in Vevay, Switzerland. The two companies signed a letter of protocol to negotiate a joint venture. Nestle is the No. 1 coffee company in Europe and ranks No. 3 in the United States coffee market, where its brands include Hills Brothers, MJB and Taster's Choice instant coffee. The initial investment is expected to total $100 million, the two companies said in a statement. Nestle and Coca-Cola are especially interested in canned ready-to-drink coffee. Japan has by far the most developed market for such beverages, with annual sales totaling more than $10 billion. Both Nestle and Coke separately offer canned coffee in Japan, although their joint venture will not operate there. Coke's canned coffee in Japan, called Georgia Coffee Original, is presweetened and is usually drunk at room temperature or chilled. ""We believe the ready-to-drink coffee market outside of Japan is basically underdeveloped,"" said Randal W. Donaldson, a Coke spokesman. Coke could benefit from the venture by putting Coke canned-coffee formulations under the Nestle trademarks, Mr. Donaldson said; Nestle benefits from access to Coke's distribution network in nearly 170 countries. Exact details of the venture are still to be negotiated. Industry analysts said the venture had great potential but was unlikely to have much short-term benefit."

1986-09-18	COKE PLANS PRETORIA PULLOUT	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it will sell its remaining holdings in South Africa within nine months, with some of them going to black South African investors. The holdings include a 30 percent share of Amalgamated Beverage Industries Ltd., one of South Africa's largest soft drink bottlers and distributors, and an 80 percent interest in a canning operation. ''Our decision to complete the process of disinvestment is a statement of our opposition to apartheid and of our support for the economic aspirations of black South Africans,'' said Donald R. Keough, president and chief operating officer of the Atlanta-based company. The company said it would continue to export the syrup concentrate from which Coca-Cola is made to South African bottlers and to donate money to two foundations it established this spring to support education, housing and business development programs for black South Africans.
1986-09-16	Coke Limits Plans To Core Businesses	Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman of the Coca-Cola Company, told analysts that $1 billion of additional debt capacity resulting from the formation of a new bottling company would be considered for acquisitions only in Coca-Cola's three core business areas - soft drinks, food and entertainment - or for a stock buyback program. The new bottling company, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., will be formed from the Beatrice Companies' bottling operations, the JTL Corporation, and the company's own bottling operations. The Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, Mr. Goizueta said, prohibit the release of details on the new venture.
1986-09-12	WYMAN TALKS WITH COKE CITED	One ingredient in the ouster of Thomas H. Wyman as chairman and chief executive of CBS Inc. was that he tried to sell CBS to the Coca-Cola Company, sources close to CBS said yesterday. The attempt - which Mr. Wyman personally reported to CBS at a lengthy board meeting Wednesday -left directors ''flabbergasted,'' the sources said. ''This Coca-Cola thing and his presentation to the board about CBS's future convinced everyone that Wyman was not the man for the job,'' one executive said.
1986-09-09	COCA-COLA TO SELL 51% OF BOTTLER	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would sell 51 percent of its newly formed bottling company to the public in what could be the largest initial stock offering ever. Analysts estimated that the transaction would raise at least $1 billion and probably several hundred million dollars more. Coca-Cola declined to say how much it expects to raise or to give any further details of the offering. But the company said the proceeds would be used to pay part of the debt it would take on to complete its previously announced acquisitions of two of its largest bottlers for a total of $2.4 billion.
1986-08-30	Coke Suit Pact	The Coca-Cola Company has settled two lawsuits against its Columbia Pictures Television division by acquiring Four D Productions to get rights to the popular ''Barney Miller'' TV series.
1986-08-24	MERV GRIFFIN TUNES UP A NEW SHOW -- ONE WITH LESS TALK	"After 23 years as a staple of the television talk-show scene, Merv Griffin will soon nod his head in agreement, laugh obligingly at someone's jokes and lean in a little closer to the couch to explore a guest's thoughts for the last time. On Sept. 5, ''The Merv Griffin Show'' will go off the air with a retrospective of highlights from over the years.

Having outlasted Joey Bishop and David Frost, Dinah Shore and Mike Douglas, and having been on nearly as long as Johnny Carson, what has made Mr. Griffin want to leave behind the format that so many people are now trying to break into?

''It's time for me to move on. I want to do something new,'' the 61-year-old, silver-haired entertainer and producer said during a recent interview in which he uncharacteristically played the interviewee - the perfect guest, if you will, chatty and forthcoming."
1986-08-24	Coke's Struggle	To the Editor: ''Keeping New Coke Alive'' (July 20) chronicles the dangerous miscalculations a company can make when it focuses its resources on the wrong objectives. Coca-Cola's management, in electing to battle Pepsi for incremental gains in market share rather than respond to the public's tastes, has nearly undermined Classic's strong position, damaging the company's reputation and fostering confusion in the marketplace.
1986-08-11	"BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Nelson Expansion Seen In Embassy Home Deal"	"Barry Peter Spikings, president of Nelson Entertainment Inc., sees the acquisition of Embassy Home Entertainment from the Coca-Cola Company for $85 million as an opportunity to expand the home-video unit to an integrated entertainment company with access to top-quality releases.

''What we saw was a company with limited resources and marvelous assets,'' Mr. Spikings said in an interview. ''If we gave this company the financial backing and the 'A' titles it needs, there's no reason this company shouldn't go places,'' he added, referring to movies that earn commercial and critical success."
1986-08-07	RECYCLING WORRIES ON PLASTIC BOTTLES	ON the side of a can recently tested by the Coca-Cola Company the words ''recyclable plastic'' are written in bold letters. But the plastic can, which has been test-marketed in Columbus, Ga., has raised concerns among environmentalists and recycling experts. Many say recycling it will not be economically feasible if it is mass-marketed. Instead, they say, most of the cans will end up in landfills or incinerators, increasing the burden on the nation's overflowing garbage dumps and possibly causing toxic emissions.
1986-08-07	Coca-Cola Agrees To Sell Video Unit	The Coca-Cola Company said that it had agreed to sell Embassy Home Entertainment, a home video company, to Nelson Entertainment Inc. for $85 million.
1986-08-06	Coke Dropping Dr Pepper Bid	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it was ending its agreement to acquire the Dr Pepper Company, at the request of Forstmann Little & Company, an investment firm that bought Dr Pepper in February 1984. The Federal Trade Commission had said in June that it would fight the $470 million acquisition on the ground that it was anticompetitive.
1986-08-01	Coke-Dr Pepper Deal Is Blocked	A Federal District Court Judge today issued a preliminary injunction against the Coca-Cola Company, halting its bid to buy the Dr Pepper Company for $470 million.
1986-07-27	"DRAWING THE LINE ON MERGERS;
COKE AND PEPSI WERE GOING TOO FAR"	"AFTER six years of generally going along with corporate America's merger decisions, the Federal Trade Commission recently challenged two huge proposed mergers in the soft drink industry. And just last week the Interstate Commerce Commission, with Justice Department backing, rejected the proposed merger of the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Santa Fe Railway. By challenging the growth ambitions of these companies, the F.T.C. and the I.C.C. returned the public spotlight to antitrust enforcement - especially merger enforcement - during the Reagan years.

The question of where the Administration was prepared to draw the line on industrial concentration has now received a partial answer - the 80 percent market share that Coke and Pepsi would have amassed after acquiring, respectively, Dr Pepper and Seven-Up was unacceptable. But the question of what degree of concentration is acceptable is still open."
1986-07-27	AN ACTION BORDERING ON THE INCOHERENT	THE Federal Trade Commission argues that the proposed mergers of Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper, and of Pepsico and Seven-Up, would limit competition in the soft drink market and make it more difficult for new companies to enter and compete. In opposing the mergers, it suggested that Coke and Pepsi's combined 80 percent share of the market in soft drinks might create monopoly power, thus raising prices and leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. These fears are groundless. They are based on theories of competition and monopoly power that are inconsistent and even incoherent. Moreover, there is no empirical evidence to support such inferences.
1986-07-25	PEPSICO TO ACQUIRE KENTUCKY FRIED	Pepsico Inc., long the No. 2 player in the soft drink business, yesterday said it would acquire the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain for $850 million, a move that would vault it into the No. 2 position in the fiercely contested fast-food industry as well. The purchase of Kentucky Fried Chicken from RJR Nabisco Inc. would give Pepsico ownership of three of the nation's 10 largest restaurant chains. It already owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, both leaders in their categories, and with the addition of Kentucky Fried Chicken, by far the biggest of the chicken chains, Pepsico's restaurant operations would have systemwide sales of more than $7 billion. The combined operations would push Pepsico past the Pillsbury Company's Burger King unit, which had sales of $4.3 billion last year, and leave it trailing only the ubiquitous McDonald's, which took in $11 billion in 1985. In terms of numbers of outlets, the combined Pepsico chains, with 14,000 restaurants, would exceed McDonald's, which has 9,000.
1986-07-20	KEEPING NEW COKE ALIVE	IN April, just a year after the introduction of new Coke, McDonald's notified The Coca-Cola Company that it was converting its 7,000 American restaurants back to original Coke. ''Our customers tell us what they want,'' said Lana Ehrsom, a McDonald's spokesman. They preferred Coke Classic.'' So, apparently, does most of the world. Coca-Cola's second-largest fast food customer, Kentucky Fried Chicken, does not serve new Coke. Nor does Denny's Inc. and several other fountain customers. Worse yet, few Coca-Cola bottlers - and none of its overseas distributors - want to handle new Coke. It sells well in a few markets like Detroit but has bombed in most, including Atlanta, Coca-Cola's headquarters city. Classic, the new name for the old cola that new Coke was supposed to replace, outsold new Coke 2 to 1 last year and has widened the margin to more than 4 to 1 this year.
1986-07-18	COCA-COLA POSTS 15% ADVANCE	Four consumer-products companies yesterday reported healthy gains in second-quarter earnings. The Coca-Cola Company said its net income rose 15 percent, while Philip Morris Companies Inc. reported that its earnings increased 17.2 percent and RJR Nabisco Inc. said its net income rose 21 percent. The American Home Products Corporation's earnings increased 8.6 percent.
1986-07-17	Advertising; Coke Has Signed Up For the 1988 Olympics	The Coca-Cola Company, the 20th-largest national advertiser, with $343.3 million spent in 1984, has committed itself to spending $50 million to advertise during the next Olympics in 1988. It announced yesterday that it had signed with both NBC-TV, which will cover the summer Olympics, and ABC-TV, which will cover the winter games, to insure that Americans will be smitten with 10 Coca-Cola spots during the coverage. The Atlanta soft drink company noted with pride that it has been involved with the Olympics since 1928.
1986-07-16	F.T.C. Challenges Coke	The Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint today challenging Coca-Cola's proposed takeover of the Dr Pepper Company, saying the acquisition would reduce competition in soft drinks in the United States. The F.T.C. voted, 4 to 1, with one absence.
1986-07-15	COKE PICKS LEADER FOR NEW UNIT	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that Brian G. Dyson, the head of its domestic soft drink operations, had been named president and chief executive of a new Coca-Cola bottling company. In forming the company, which currently has no name, Coca-Cola will combine two recently purchased independent bottling operations with its own bottling properties. Altogether, the venture will bottle about 30 percent of the company's domestic soft drinks. Mr. Dyson, 50 years old, has been a corporate executive vice president since April and president of Coca-Cola USA since 1978. Coke said yesterday that Edwin R. Mellett, an executive vice president at Coca-Cola USA and a former executive at Pepsico Inc., had been named as his successor.
1986-07-02	Economic Scene; F.T.C.'s Ruling On Soda Deals	FOR almost six years now, the Reagan Administration has encourged corporate mergers of almost every size and shape - the $10 billion Texaco-Getty combination, the $6.3 billion G.E.-RCA deal and the $4.8 billion Sperry-Burroughs transaction. Such deals would have been unheard of in the 1970's. Then along came the Coca-Cola Company, No. 1 in the soft-drink industry, wanting to buy Dr Pepper, No. 4, while Pepsico Inc., No. 2, proposed the acquisition of Seven-Up, No. 3. The two deals would have cost a total of $850 million and given Coke up to 46 percent and Pepsi 36 percent of the $30 billion carbonated soft-drink market.
1986-07-02	COKE TO PURCHASE ITS LARGEST BOTTLER	Taking the biggest step yet in expanding its role in the bottling business, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had signed a letter of intent to buy the largest Coke bottler in the country - the JTL Corporation - for about $1.4 billion. In addition, Coca-Cola said it would now ''explore the possibility'' of creating a new bottling company under a new name and then selling shares to the public. No details were given but Coca-Cola was believed to be thinking in terms of retaining only about half the stock in the new bottling company. The agreement to buy JTL is the latest in a series of acquisitions of independent bottlers by Coca-Cola and its chief competitor, Pepsico Inc. The purchases are expected to produce a more efficient marketing system, analysts said, in part by weeding out weaker franchise operations. The analysts added that the purchases would also result in more stable soft drink prices for consumers over the next few years.
1986-06-29	Clothing Dispute With Coca-Cola	COCA-COLA clothes were being advertised by some retail outlets as ''All-American.'' But the advertised items, some American textile manufacturers complained, were being made in Hong Kong and Macao.
1986-06-27	Dr Pepper, Coke To Battle F.T.C.	The owners of the Dr Pepper Company said that they would join with the Coca-Cola Company to fight the Federal Trade Commission's decision to block the merger between the soft-drink companies. ''We intend to proceed with our deal with Coca-Cola, which we think is in all respects proper and will increase competition,'' said Theodore Forstmann, general partner of Forstmann Little & Company, the New York investment concern that owns Dr Pepper.
1986-06-27	Soft Drinks and Other Trusts	Big is not always beautiful, says the Federal Trade Commission. By unanimous vote, it has thrown itself into the path of two huge mergers, PepsiCo with Seven-Up and Coca-Cola with Dr Pepper, on the ground that yielding 81 percent of sales to just two companies would vastly reduce competition in soft drinks. Pepsi and Philip Morris, the owner of Seven-Up, responded by dropping their merger plan. The commission will fight Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper in court.
1986-06-25	SEVEN-UP SALE TO PEPSICO CANCELED	The Philip Morris Companies said today that it had ended its agreement to sell its Seven-Up Company to Pepsico Inc. because of opposition by the Federal Trade Commission. Meanwhile, the F.T.C. filed suit in Federal District Court here to block the proposed takeover of the Dr Pepper Company by the Coca-Cola Company. In response, Coca-Cola agreed to delay the purchase of Dr Pepper stock until the end of court hearings scheduled to begin July 16 in Washington. The actions were part of the struggle for control of the nation's carbonated soft-drink market, dominated by the industry's two intensely competitive leaders - Coke, with 39 percent of the market, and Pepsi, with 29 percent.
1986-06-21	F.T.C. ACTS TO BLOCK SODA DEALS	The Government said today that it would act to stop the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. from buying two smaller soft-drink companies because the mergers could substantially reduce competition. In a long-awaited decision that pleased critics of the Reagan Administration's liberal antitrust policies, the Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously to block Coca-Cola from buying the Dr Pepper Company and Pepsico from buying the Seven-Up Company. Coca-Cola is the No. 1 soft-drink company and Dr Pepper is No. 4; Pepsi is No. 2 and Seven-Up ranks third. The two acquisitions would cost a total of $860 million and if completed would give Coke and Pepsi control of 80 percent of the nation's soft-drink market.
1986-06-20	Royal Crown Sues Over Rivals' Deals	The Royal Crown Cola Company filed an antitrust suit seeking to stop the Coca-Cola Company from completing its proposed merger with the Dr Pepper Company, and Pepsico Inc. from going ahead with its plan to acquire the Seven-Up Company. The suit, filed in a Federal court in Columbus, Ga., asserts that the proposed deals ''will substantially lessen competition'' in the industry.
1986-06-17	COKE TO BUY BEATRICE BOTTLING UNIT	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had agreed to purchase a major Coke bottling system from the Beatrice Companies for about $1 billion. At the same time, however, Coke announced the collapse of its plans to combine its company-owned bottling operations with those of its largest franchised bottler. The breakdown of the talks with the JTL Corporation of Chatanooga, Tenn., will at least slow Coke's plan to spin off its company-owned bottlers into a separate corporation. Coke has been overhauling its bottling system by buying franchises, keeping some for itself and selling others. Coke's aim is to weed out weaker bottlers and make them stronger either by managing them itself or combining them with more successful franchisees in the same geographical area. Th end result, Coke hopes, will be a more efficient system that sells more soda.
1986-06-17	NOTES ON FASHION	''IT didn't swallow your credit card, did it?'' Mohan B. Murjani, chairman of Murjani International, asked at last week's press conference unveiling what may be fashion's first Coke machine. The electronic kiosk, known as Eric (after its supplier, the Electronic Retailing Investment Corporation), sells Coca-Cola fashions 24 hours a day outside Murjani's Fizzazz boutique at 280 Columbus Avenue, at 73d Street. Mr. Murjani says he hopes to have 1,500 machines in operation by the end of 1987. ''There are 35,000 Coke machines in New York City,'' Richard Hosp, Murjani's senior vice president of marketing, pointed out hopefully.
1986-06-03	Cadbury Will Buy RJR Nabisco Units	Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. said yesterday that it would buy the Canada Dry and Sunkist soft-drink operations from RJR Nabisco Inc. for $230 million and that it would then sell Canada Dry's Canadian bottling plants to the Coca-Cola Company for $90 million. The deal, which has been expected for several weeks, would end RJR's disappointing foray into the soft-drink industry and give London-based Cadbury Schweppes a stronger presence in the North American market. It would also strengthen Coke's distribution system in Canada by giving it manufacturing plants in Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, where it now lacks bottlers, as well as five regional distribution warehouses. ''It's a wonderful deal for Coke,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Montgomery Securities.
1986-05-16	SALE OF CANADA DRY, SUNKIST SEEN	RJR Nabisco Inc. plans to announce soon that it will sell its Canada Dry and Sunkist beverage operations to Cadbury Schweppes Inc., industry sources said yesterday. The sale, which has been expected by many analysts, would continue a broad restructuring of the soft drink industry. Beverage Digest, a trade publication, reported yesterday that the deal was ''imminent,'' and other sources also said an agreement was near.
1986-05-09	COCA-COLA FILLS ATLANTA WITH A CLELBRATION OF ITS CENTENNIAL	One hundred years after an Atlanta pharmacist, John Styth Pemberton, mixed up the first sticky batch in a backyard cooker, the people who run the Coca-Cola Company are throwing a birthday party with almost 24,000 guests to help them celebrate. Coke has long been more than a product. It is a cultural phenomenon that has also made a lot of people a lot of money, especially in Atlanta. The company, whose sleek headquarters building is an Atlanta landmark, has all but taken over the city for a five-day centennial celebration that started Tuesday. The company has filled every downtown hotel with delegations of bottlers from all 50 states and 122 foreign countries.
1986-04-19	Mixing Politics and Oranges	It was a drama of citrus economics and Washington politics. Because of winter freeze-outs, pest infestation and other problems that have plagued the Florida citrus crop in recent years, a number of major American citrus companies decided to diversify by starting up groves in various Caribbean Basin countries. ''We felt it was in our best interest to have another source of supply for longterm growth,'' said Michelle Beale, vice president for public affairs of Coca-Cola Foods, which makes Minute Maid orange juice. Hedging their bet even further, the companies approached the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an agency set up by Congress to insure American companies that invest in developing countries against such risks as wars, revolutions and expropriation.
1986-04-10	McDONALD'S SWITCHING TO 'OLD' COKE FORMULA	Coca-Cola Classic has been given a resounding vote of confidence, at the expense of ''new'' Coke. The McDonald's Corporation, the nation's largest fountain service user of Coke, confirmed today that it would switch from ''new'' Coke to Coke Classic effective April 28. ''Consumers in the United States show a definite preference for Coke Classic,'' said Robert L. Keyser, a spokesman for McDonald's, the nation's largest fast-food company.
1986-03-25	CORRECTION	Because of an editing error, an article yesterday on a gift by the Coca-Cola Company to establish new foundations in South Africa incorrectly described Africare, a Washington organization. It supports economic development programs in a number of African nations, but none in South Africa.
1986-03-24	COCA-COLA GIVING $10 MILLION TO HELP SOUTH AFRICA BLACKS	The Coca-Cola Company is providing an initial gift of $10 million to establish new foundations in South Africa to open up opportunities in business, housing and education for black South Africans. The foundations, called Equal Opportunity Funds, are to be administered by a board of prominent South Africans that includes Bishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. Coca-Cola is also setting up a nonprofit organization in Atlanta to raise more money for the foundations.
1986-03-01	POP GOES THE SAMENESS	The war of the cola giants -Pepsi and Coca - threatens to wipe out the third world of soda pop. The supercolas have already swallowed 7-Up and Dr Pepper and there is grave doubt that Royal Crown Cola can survive as an independent carbonating force. This is an old story, the concentration of power in few supercorporations and the disappearance of the rest of the competition. You don't have to be an antique to remember when the Hudson, Packard, Studebaker and Nash were as easily identifiable by American youngsters as the Chrysler, Ford and General Motors cars.
1986-02-25	DR PEPPER SALE	Forstmann Little & Company said it had signed, as expected, a definitive agreement to sell the Dr Pepper Company to the Coca-Cola Company for $470 million.
1986-02-24	OTHER SODAS CAUGHT IN COKE-PEPSI WAR	The ever-intensifying marketing war between the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. offers proof of the old adage that when elephants fight, the ants get stomped on. While fighting each other for more of the soft-drink business, Coke and Pepsi have grown at the expense of second-tier brands. Now competitive pressure on the industry's also-rans is about to intensify, possibly threatening the existence of some of them. Coke announced last week that it had agreed to acquire the Dr Pepper Company, the nation's fourth-largest soft-drink concern, and Pepsi had already arranged to purchase the Seven-Up Company, the third-largest soda maker.
1986-02-23	Coke Enlists Dr Pepper in Soft-Drink War	The Coca-Cola Company uncapped last week its latest formula for staying at the pinnacle of the soft-drink industry. In a deal that puts a comfortable distance between it and archrival Pepsico, the company announced that it had agreed to buy Dr Pepper for $470 million.
1986-02-21	DR. PEPPER BUILDS COKE'S LEAD	The Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Dallas-based Dr Pepper Company for $470 million in a deal that is important both for the world of finance and the soft drink industry. It represents one of the largest windfalls ever for investors in a leveraged buyout and it is a shrewd strategic move by Coke to keep its No. 1 position. ''It's a royal coup poker move by Coke,'' said Jesse Meyers, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ''Coke's bottlers are burping with delight. Their team has made a whopper of an announcement.''
1986-02-20	COKE BID FOR DR. PEPPER IS EXPECTED	The Coca-Cola Company is expected to announce within days that it will purchase the Dr Pepper Company, according to Beverage Digest, a soft drink industry newsletter. The acquisition, if completed, would bring together the nation's largest and fourth-largest soft drink companies, and would further extend Coke's total market share lead over arch-rival Pepsi-Cola. The purchase would continue a trend towards consolidation in the industry and would also represent a rapid response by Coke to Pepsi's latest inroads into Coke's dominance of the $26 billion soda market. Just weeks ago, Pepsi announced that it would acquire the Seven-Up Company, the third-largest in the business, from Philip Morris Inc. for $380 million in a move that would increase Pepsi's corporate market share from 28 percent to 35 percent, about four points less than Coke.
1986-02-20	COCA-COLA NET UP 45.1%	The Coca-Cola Company reported yesterday that its fourth-quarter income from continuing operations rose 19.2 percent. A one-time gain pushed net income for the quarter up 45.1 percent.
1986-02-19	Coke Purchasing Merv Griffin Unit	The Coca-Cola Company said it had reached agreement in principle to acquire Merv Griffin Enterprises, which produces television game shows including ''Wheel of Fortune.''
1986-02-18	COKE TO SHED A VIDEO UNIT	Embassy Home Entertainment, a video cassette company, said Friday that Andre Blay, its chairman and chief executive, intends to buy the company from its parent, the Coca-Cola Company, for less than $80 million. In addition, Embassy intends to expand into making movies for theaters, Mr. Blay said.
1986-02-18	COKE AIMS ITS ADS AT 2 MARKETS	SINCE the Coca-Cola Company did its celebrated flip-flop last summer and revived the original formula of its flagship brand as Coke Classic, its advertising strategy has been in something of a shambles. The Atlanta-based soft-drink company, which has long been admired for its precise, well-researched ways, was largely unprepared to cope with promoting two very similar cola products, Classic and the much ballyhooed but poorly performing new Coke. Now, after six months of study, the company is about to begin new campaigns for the two Cokes. For the first time, the products will be distinguished from one another in their advertising, which will be aimed at different target markets. ''It seems that they've identified those two markets as two separate groups with two separate loyalties and two separate television schedules,'' said Jesse Myers, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
1986-02-07	Coca-Cola Deal For Shows Seen	The Coca-Cola Company is expected to announce soon, possibly today, that it has agreed to buy some of the assets of Merv Griffin Enterprises, including the popular television game show ''Wheel of Fortune,'' television industry sources said.
1986-01-28	Pepsi Termed No. 1 Seller	Pepsi-Cola, moving into the gap between old Coke and new Coke, has become the nation's best-selling single soft drink, an industry publication says. Coca-Cola, as the Atlanta-based company's new formula, fell to No. 2 and Coke Classic, which uses the decades-old formula, came in third, according to the latest issue of Beverage Digest.
1986-01-28	Coca-Cola Plans Bottling Merger	The Coca-Cola Company said it planned to merge its bottling interests with those of the JTL Corporation, which operates Coca-Cola bottling companies in the West, to form the world's largest independent soft-drink bottler. Terms were not disclosed.
1986-01-25	NEW COKE PRODUCTS	The Coca-Cola Company introduced new products yesterday in the suddenly burgeoning non-cola segment of the soft-drink industry. Coke showed regular and diet versions of Minute Maid lemon-lime soda, which contains 10 percent fruit juices and is fortified with vitamins. The Atlanta-based soft-drink company also said it would bring out nationally its regular and diet Minute Maid orange sodas, which have been in test markets since last summer.
1986-01-25	PEPSICO IN PACT FOR SEVEN-UP	In the largest consolidation in the soft-drink industry, Pepsico Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy most of the Seven-Up Company from Philip Morris Companies Inc. for $380 million. Once completed, the merger of Pepsico, the nation's second-largest soft-drink maker, and Seven-Up, the third-largest, will place the market share of products under the Pepsico banner within about three percentage points of those of the Coca-Cola Company, the industry leader. The merger would also hinder the chances of creating a third major soft-drink franchise system to compete against Pepsi and Coke products. Separate Sales Planned The purchase would cover the Seven-Up trademark and worldwide franchises but not its 16 North American bottling plants or its foods group, which includes the Ventura Coastal Corporation and Oregon Freeze Dry Foods Inc. Philip Morris said it intended to sell those businesses separately ''in the near future,'' The stocks of both companies advanced on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, with Philip Morris up $1.875, to $91.625 a share, and Pepsico rising $1.625, to $68.25.
1985-12-26	Goizueta's Gamble	Roberto C. Goizueta is the man who tried in 1985 to take away the world's favorite soft drink - a symbol of America in 155 countries - but was forced by a surge of protests to give it back. In late April, Mr. Goizueta, the 53-year-old chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, announced he was going to scrap the original 99-year-old, secret formula for Coca-Cola. Amid great fanfare, he tried to convince consumers that the sweeter, fizzier taste of the new product was ''smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavor.''
1985-11-15	AT THE MOVIES	Do things go better with Coke? Not according to most of the people involved in ''Where Are the Children?'' A $4 million production based on a best-selling suspense novel by Mary Higgins Clark, ''Where Are the Children?'' has been languishing at Columbia since last spring. Columbia is owned by Coca-Cola. From the movie's star, Jill Clayburgh, to its director, Bruce Malmuth, to its screenwriter, Jack Sholder, to its producer, Zev Braun, people connected with ''Where Are the Children?'' wonder aloud whether Coca-Cola got frightened by the movie's story of children in jeopardy and its subtext of child abuse.
1985-11-14	New Lineup For Coca-Cola	The Coca-Cola Company has announced a realignment in its North American advertising agencies. Most of the realignment is under the Interpublic umbrella.
1985-10-30	Coke Bottlers Pursue Suit	Forty bottlers suing the Coca-Cola Company because of a pricing dispute have asked a Federal judge to declare that the secret syrups used in Coke and Diet Coke are identical and should cost the same. Federal District Judge Murray M. Schwartz in August ordered Coca-Cola to turn over formulas for Coke and Diet Coke. Coca-Cola refused, asserting competitors would benefit from the disclosure.
1985-10-23	Topics;   Cars and Colas Coke Jokes	Everyone seems to be having fun at Coca-Cola's expense. The wisecracks proliferated when the company felt obliged to restore old (''Classic'') Coke to the market along with its new cola, introduced just last April.
1985-10-18	Old Coke Outselling the New in U.S.	Three months after it bowed to consumer pressure by bringing back the original formula of the world's best-selling soft drink, the Coca-Cola Company acknowledged yesterday that Coca-Cola Classic was outselling new Coke in the United States. A company spokesman, Carlton Curtis, said that the overseas introduction of the new formula, originally scheduled for this fall, has been delayed until spring. But he denied that plans had been canceled to introduce the new formula abroad. Mr. Curtis, made his comments in an interview about the company's third-quarter earnings results announced yesterday. Because of higher marketing costs for the introduction of Coca-Cola Classic and Cherry Coke this summer, the company's operating earnings fell 3.2 percent, to $296.5 million, from $305.9 million in the period last year.
1985-10-04	DE LAURENTIIS TO MARKET OWN FILMS	Dino de Laurentiis, who purchased Embassy Pictures from Coca-Cola last week, said today that he had bought the company so he could distribute his own films instead of having to go through a major studio. Mr. de Laurentiis, who makes five or six pictures a year - most of them at a film studio he recently built in North Carolina - has been unhappy over having to give up videocassette and pay-cable rights to the movies in order to get distribution. ''Today, in most cases, those ancillary rights are more important than theatrical rights,'' he said at a news conference. ''Five years ago if we had said videocassette rights would be worth 50 percent of the cost of a movie, everybody would have laughed.''
1985-09-26	Coke to Sell Unit	The Coca-Cola Company has agreed to sell Embassy Pictures to Dino De Laurentiis Productions Inc. for an undisclosed amount, the companies have announced. Coke, which acquired Embassy Communications and Tandem Productions last month for $485 million in cash and common stock, will retain ownership of Embassy Television, Embassy Home Entertainment and Embassy Telecommunications. Coca-Cola said the sale was in accordance with previously announced plans to divest itself of Embassy's film operations.
1985-09-11	Coca-Cola Rejects Order on Formula	The Coca-Cola Company has refused to obey a Federal judge's order to turn over its cola formulas, saying that revealing the ingredients even under a protective order could lead to public disclosure. District Judge Murray M. Schwartz had ordered the formulas turned over in a lawsuit brought by 40 bottling companies against Coca-Cola.
1985-09-10	COKE'S STOCK FALLS ON EARNINGS REPORT	The Coca-Cola Company's stock price dropped yesterday after the company released 1985 earnings estimates that were lower than many analysts had expected. The company's shares were down $1.25, to $69, on the New York Stock Exchange despite Coke's announcement that it would repurchase up to five million of its shares on the open market during the rest of the year. Coca-Cola cited increased marketing expenses for its soft drinks during the fourth quarter in saying that operating income would be ''up slightly or flat for the year.''
1985-08-27	Minute Maid Orange Soda	The Coca-Cola Company yesterday introduced yet another soft drink. This time, however, the product will not fall under the Coca-Cola brand name, which has gotten more than its share of marketing attention this year.
1985-08-20	New Coke vs. Classic: The Verdict Is Still Out	Coca-Cola Classic, the revived original version of the world's best-selling soft drink, is now available in more than 80 percent of the nation's retail outlets. But retailers and fountain operators say it is still too soon to tell how well the latest incarnation of the old product will sell, and what effect it will have on sales of ''new'' Coke. And while consumer tastes will have a large say in the ultimate success or failure of a two-Coke strategy, the Coca-Cola Company seems determined not to let Classic usurp new Coke's role as its flagship brand.
1985-08-15	Advertising;   Coke Held Not to Be Real Thing	THE Sugar Association, an industry group primarily responsible for scientific research, information and education, struck out at the Coca-Cola Company yesterday with advertising that links the company's reduced use of sugar from 1979 to 1984 to the declining market share of regular Coca-Cola. (It is this decline, hastened by the introduction of Diet Coke in 1982, that analysts say led to the replacement of the product with new Coke in April.) In advertising created by North Castle Partners Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., the association is spending one-tenth of its $2.5 million budget over two days. Full-page advertisements in 13 major newspapers show a chart illustrating the loss of market share of regular Coke. The association's ads ask for the support of consumers in a campaign to encourage Coca-Cola to use beet or cane sugar, instead of high fructose corn syrup in its products. In addition, the association wants consumers to know that Coca-Cola Classic, which was the reintroduced original Coke formula, really is not the original formula since sugar is not the sweetener.
1985-08-10	COCA COLA SETS TEXTILE SWITCH	The Coca-Cola Company promised today to try to fulfill the ''all-American'' promise of ads for clothes that carry its name, after some textile makers learned the garments were mostly stitched abroad. ''We made a mistake,'' Ira C. Herbert, executive vice president of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, said after meeting with North Carolina textile executives. Mr. Herbert said Coca-Cola would ''move as quickly as we can'' to have the clothes made in the United States.
1985-08-09	Coca-Cola Attire Draws an Outcry	The Coca-Cola Company seems to be getting the kind of attention it would rather not have these days. Last month, a public outcry forced the company to bring back the Coke it had recently stopped producing in favor of a new formula. Now, another new venture has stirred up more public relations headaches for the Atlanta soft-drink giant.
1985-07-24	'Coke Classic' Begins Production	Bottling plants in several parts of the country have resumed production of Coca-Cola's 99-year-old formula.
1985-07-19	"EARNINGS;

Coca-Cola Has a 6% Increase"	"The Coca-Cola Company and Philip Morris Inc. - two of the nation's largest consumer companies - yesterday reported higher earnings in the second quarter. A third large consumer products company, R. J. Reynolds Industries, reported a 14.3 percent decline in profit; however, not counting a charge for discontinued operations in last year's quarter, the company posted a 12 percent earnings gain.

Coca-Cola, which owns Columbia Pictures, markets Sprite and six Coca-Cola soft drinks, and produces Minute Maid juice products, reported a 6 percent earnings increase for the quarter, helped by growth in overseas volume and the strength of diet Coke."
1985-07-17	Interpublic Expects Coke to Stay at McCann	Philip H. Geier, chairman of the Interpublic Group of Companies, when asked the other day, said that since his McCann-Erickson agency is the Coca-Cola agency, he is assuming that the new/old Classic Coke will continue to get its advertising from McCann. According to a memo from Oppenheimer & Company's beverage analyst, Joe Frazzano, he feels the same way. He also believes that additional spending will be between $10 million and $30 million.
1985-07-16	Soda, the Life of the Party	With all the hoopla about the escalating cola war, one topic has been ignored: the political implications. As with the political parties, there are only two major players: Coca-Cola, the drink of Democrats, and Pepsi-Cola, the Republicans' refresher. Sure, there are third-party colas, but as in politics not much is said about them.
1985-07-14	COCA-COLA SWALLOWS ITS WORDS	WHEN consumer outcry forced The Coca-Cola Company to reintroduce its original formula last week, Roger Enrico, the president of Pepsi-Cola U.S.A., was quick to proclaim the 10-week-old new Coke ''the Edsel of the 80's.'' It seemed to many others as well, especially the consumers who wanted the old drink back, that Coca-Cola had made a terrible mistake by tampering with a 99-year-old tradition. One thing was for sure. Whether the new Coke tasted better or worse, the company had underestimated the emotional power of its own trademark and created a backlash among loyal Coke drinkers.
1985-07-13	CORRECTION	A table on the front page of Business Day yesterday with an article about Coca-Cola carried an incorrect label for the final column of figures. The figures represented the change, in percentage points, in the market share of the major soft drink brands from 1983 to 1984.
1985-07-12	COCA-COLA'S BIG MISJUDGEMENT	When the Coca-Cola Company introduced a reformulated version of the world's best-selling soft drink on April 23, it was well aware that it might alienate some faithful Coke drinkers. The company, however, expected that alienation to fade. It was completely unprepared for how it would spread and deepen in the two months following the debut of the new Coke. In interviews and at a news conference yesterday, Coca-Cola executives and bottlers explained how that development was the main reason for its decision, announced Wednesday, to revive the ''old'' Coke under the brand name Coca-Cola Classic. Gradual Realization The executives said they realized only gradually how badly they had misjudged consumer reaction. However slow in coming, though, the realization led swiftly to the judgment that the only way to recover was to revive the product that inspired such abiding loyalty.
1985-07-12	FANS OF 'OLD' COKE WOULDN'T GIVE UP	Roy Champiomont, chairman of the Champiomont Marble Company in Houston, felt so strongly about the Coca-Cola Company's decision to change the 99-year-old formula for Coke last April that he wrote a protest song. The final lines of ''You Changed the Taste,'' he said, express what many diehard Coke drinkers felt about the introduction of new Coke: Don't take it out on America. Our feelings are very strong, After 99 years of being right, you did your country wrong. So now hear our plea, and know that this is no joke.
1985-07-12	Pepsi Welcomes Move	Dubbing the Coca-Cola Company's reformulated cola ''the Edsel of the 80's,'' Roger Enrico, president of Pepsi-Cola USA, said yesterday that his archrival's decision last April to change its flagship product represented a colossal marketing blunder. He predicted that his competitor faced ''a very substantial competitive challenge'' in trying to market both the old and new Cokes.
1985-07-11	MOVE SEEN AIDING COKE'S TOTAL SALES	When the Coca-Cola Company locked away its fabled formula 7X in an Atlanta bank vault in late April and introduced a new, sweeter version of the world's best-selling soft drink, it took one of the great marketing gambles of all time. Yesterday the company conceded that perhaps it should not have bet all of its chips on reformulated Coke. Analysts and marketing experts agreed yesterday that the company had lost considerable face because of its decision. Most analysts, however, felt that, with the reintroduction of the old formula of Coke, the company would come out of an embarrassing situation with a higher overall market share.
1985-07-11	'OLD' COKE COMING BACK AFTER OUTCRY BY FAITHFUL	In one of the most stunning about-faces in the history of marketing, the Coca-Cola Company yielded to thousands of irate consumers yesterday and said it would bring back the original Coke formula that it scrapped three months ago. The product will be sold under the brand name Coca-Cola Classic, the company said, emphasizing that it would continue to market the new, sweeter soft drink that it introduced with great fanfare last April. ''It's a multimillion-dollar reversal,'' said James G. Shennan, president of S&O Consultants Inc., a San Francisco marketing and design firm. ''I am very surprised.'' Listening to Consumers Explaining the move, Thomas Gray, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said: ''Over 40 million consumers every day in the United States enjoy Coca-Cola but thousands of dedicated Coca-Cola consumers have told us they still want the original taste as an option. We have listened and we are taking action to satisfy their request.''
1985-07-11	Topics;   Talking Back Classic Wisdom	''Don't change the formula for Coca-Cola'' used to be a business aphorism for leaving well enough alone. And for 99 years the formula stood firm.
1985-07-10	Coke Cuts TV Tie to Rock Show	COCA-COLA, which was to have been the major advertiser on the ABC-TV Network's three hour prime-time coverage of the highly publicized Live Aid telethon of rock stars Saturday, withdrew its involvement yesterday. The event, being called the electronic Woodstock, is intended to raise funds to aid the starving in Africa. It is understood that the reason for Coke's withdrawal is the existence of signs for competitive products in the Wembley Stadium in London, which with John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia are the two locations for the fund-raiser. Competitive signs will have no effect on the radio coverage so the embattled Atlanta soft drink giant can continue to be the only network sponsor of the ABC Radio's 6 A.M. to midnight coverage for which it is paying $360,000.
1985-07-08	Space Choice: Coke or Pepsi	The cola war is heading for space as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning to stock the space shuttle Challenger with both Coke and Pepsi for its weeklong mission that begins Friday, officials said. However, the competition will focus not on the taste of the colas but on the ability of their specially made containers to withstand the conditions of weightlessness.
1985-07-06	Sale by Lear Of Coke Shares	The television producer Norman Lear and his partner, A. Jerrold Perenchio, plan to sell 3.5 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company, or about 2.6 percent of the company's shares outstanding. The partners, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, gave no reason for the sale, but said the shares would be sold on the open market at the prevailing market price.
1985-06-20	Pepsi Problem at Coke Plant	A Coca-Cola employee who received a three-day suspension for drinking a Pepsi on the job was returned to work after one day and told he would not miss any pay. Charles Edwards, general manager of the Coca-Cola bottling plant where the employee, Dexter Gooden, works, said the layoff was an ''overreaction'' by a supervisor. Mr. Edwards said, however, ''It is against our policy for employees to drink competitive products on our property.''
1985-06-18	Coca-Cola to Buy 2 Television Units	The Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday that it had reached definitive agreements to acquire the television production companies, Embassy Communications and Tandem Productions, for cash and stock amounting to $485 million. Analysts said such transactions had been rumored and represented a further expansion into the entertainment industry by Coca-Cola, which already owns Columbia Pictures Industries.
1985-06-12	FANS OF OLD COKE SAY THE NEW IS NOT IT	Seven weeks after the Coca-Cola Company changed its longtime recipe, many frustrated Coke drinkers are complaining that the new taste is just not the real thing. ''It's a taste tragedy,'' said Robert Hester, a writer in Jacksonville, Fla. ''It's flat and too sweet,'' said Kathy Kapture, a Detroit waitress. ''It doesn't have the same fizz, it doesn't quench your thirst and I'm not buying it.''
1985-06-05	Asset Sale Set By Coca-Cola	The Coca-Cola Company said that it would sell about $750 million of its financial assets in its entertainment sector. Thomas E. Gray, a spokesman, said the company had not determined how the funds would be used: ''We're taking a look at reinvesting it into one of our companies.

1985-06-04	4th Coke Plant in China	The Coca-Cola Company said today that it had opened its fourth bottling plant in China. The new plant, in Zhuhai, on the southern coast, will bottle Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta orange drink. Other Coke plants in China are in Peking, Guangzhou and Xiamen.
1985-05-30	REYNOLDS NABISCO BID IS REPORTED	R.J. Reynolds Industries, the nation's second-largest cigarette maker and operator of the vast Kentucky Fried Chicken chain, has offered to pay more than $5 billion in cash for Nabisco Brands Inc., Wall Street sources reported yesterday. There was no certainty that the two would proceed. But Wall Street sources said that even if the deal fell through, several potential bidders might be waiting in the wings. They said that Philip Morris Inc., the nation's largest cigarette maker, had already retained Wall Street help and was watching the situation closely. Unilever and the Coca-Cola Company were viewed as other possible bidders.
1985-05-22	THE LAST FOREVER	Some things should be forever, yet so few are. Permanence, permanence - above all, permanence! The human race requires it. Not in all things, of course, and not in too many things, but in a few things - human relationships, philosophical or religious principles, soda pop, baseball. Without a few things that endure forever immutable, life becomes a savage interchange among aimless drifters.
1985-05-12	AT PEPSICO, VICTORY IS DECLARED	THE people over at Pepsico's headquarters were talking about Coke last week. About how Pepsi-Cola had ''licked'' its No. 1 competitor. And how the sweet taste of victory tastes a lot like Pepsi. The quiet types let their bodies do the talking: offering thumbs up signs and winks as they passed each other in the cavernous marble hallways of the company's seven-building 10-acre site here. Smiles were worth a thousand words. Three weeks ago, the Coca-Cola Company announced it had scrapped the top-secret formula for the world's best-selling soft drink - a formula that has been used for 99 years. In its place, Coca-Cola was offering a new, sweeter Coke whose ''smoother, rounder yet bolder'' taste would attract new customers. But a sample of those who tasted the new product said its sweeter, less-fizzy taste was a little more like Pepsi.
1985-05-02	Selling The New Coca-Cola	THIS Sunday is the day that the world's best-selling soft drink introduces its new formulation into the world's most important market. And, surprisingly, there are probably a lot of people who really do not care. Their numbers, however, do not include some 6,000 very interested parties who will be the guests of Coca-Cola at Radio City for a gala introductory ceremony that will include the talents of Ray Charles, the Harlem Boys Choir, the American Symphony Orchestra and, of course, the Rockettes. Now are you beginning to realize how important this is?

1985-04-29	U.S. COMPANIES CUT SOME SOUTH AFRICA LINKS	Publicly citing declining profitability in South Africa, some American corporations have begun to scale back - or sell off - their South African operations. But analysts and some company officers say that the increasingly militant campaign against American involvement in South Africa is also having an impact. In the last few months, Ford and Coca-Cola have reduced their visibility there by announcing that they are converting their controlling interests in South African companies into holdings of less than 50 percent. Perkin-Elmer, a high-technology company based in Connecticut, and Blue Bell, a clothing manufacturer in North Carolina, have sold their South African operations.

1985-04-26	HOME OF COKE LAMENTS CHANGE IN WINNING FORMULA	When a noted former Mayor of Atlanta fell ill near the end of his life, reporters converged on a city hospital and demanded to know how the patient was doing. As the story is now remembered, an aide offered the ultimate Atlantan assurance that the patient, William B. Hartsfield, though fading, was still in obvious command of his faculties. ''He's O.K.,'' she said. ''He just asked for a Co'Cola.''
1985-04-23	FORMULA FOR COCA-COLA IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE	The Coca-Cola Company is expected to announce today a reformulation of Coca-Cola, the world's best- selling soft drink. The Atlanta-based beverage and entertainment company has refused to comment, and bottlers, who are sequestered today in Atlanta, have learned only that they would receive a different concentrate. But, industry experts yesterday were convinced that the announcement involved a reformulation of Coke's top-secret formula. Coca-Cola is a mixture of water, sugar, caramel, phosphoric acid, vanilla, caffeine, extracts from coca leaves and cola nuts, and a substance called 7X.
1985-04-20	NEW COKE FRUIT DRINK IS EXPECTED NEXT WEEK	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would make a major announcement Tuesday in New York. The Atlanta-based company was not more specific, but analysts speculated that the company would introduce its new Minute Maid brand fruit juice beverage.
1985-04-18	COCA-COLA PROFITS RISE 2.3%	The Coca-Cola Company yesterday reported a 2.3 percent increase in earnings in the first quarter on an 11.4 percent gain in revenues. The Atlanta-based soft drink and entertainment company had net income of $141.2 million, or $1.08 a share, for the period ended March 31, compared with $138 million, or $1.02 a share, in the 1984 quarter. Revenues rose to $1.76 billion, from $1.58 billion.
1985-03-15	COKE TO OFFER DRINK FOR EXERCISERS	The Coca-Cola Company, continuing an aggressive series of new-product introductions, will begin to test-market next month a beverage designed for heavy exercisers. The company hopes that the glucose-based drink, called Max, will appeal to the estimated 20 million Americans who exercise for five or more hours a week. Max will be tested in Houston and parts of Colorado by its Coca-Cola Food Company division.
1985-03-14	COKE SETTLES WITH COKE-IS-IT	The former Frederick Koch, who legally changed his name to Coke-Is- It, has negotiated an agreement with the Coca-Cola Company allowing him to keep his new name, a lawyer said today. The agreement prohibits Mr. Coke- Is-It, 54 years old, from using the name commercially.
1985-03-13	ADVERTISING ;   Genesis Of Wine Campaign	THE four top domestic wine companies were collectively spending about $11 million a year on advertising their premium California jug wines in 1977. That was about half of what beer or spirits advertisers were spending to generate a comparable sales volume. And that was one of the reasons that the Coca-Cola Company - no small- time advertiser itself - decided to throw some competition against the likes of Almaden, Inglenook, Masson and Sebastiani. Today, industrywide spending is up to about $60 million.
1985-03-09	ROBERT WOODRUFF IS DEAD: CREATED COCA-COLA EMPIRE	Robert W. Woodruff, a college dropout who became the driving force behind the growth of the Coca-Cola Company and built it into an international financial empire, died Thursday at Emory University Hospital. He was 95 years old and had been hospitalized for 10 days. Mr. Woodruff took control of the company in 1923. He retired in 1955 but remained as a director and chairman of the finance committee of the board of directors until 1981, when he became chairman emeritus. He left the board in 1984, ending a 61-year association with the company. Throughout his life, Mr. Woodruff gave millions of dollars to educational and cultural institutions, including $200 million to Emory University.
1985-02-20	NOW, CHERRY COKE IN A CAN	When Diet Coke became the country's third-best-selling drink only two years after its 1982 nationwide debut, officials of the Coca-Cola Company hailed it as ''the fastest-growing major soft drink in history.'' Now, they hope, history will repeat itself with the company's newest product: Cherry Coke. The Atlanta-based company will begin testing the cherry-flavored cola drink in several cities next month. Analysts predicted that if the product was introduced for mass consumption, the effect would likely be twofold: Cherry Coke would spur competition with the Dr Pepper Company, which makes the top-selling cherry-flavored cola, and, at the same time, expand the soft-drink market over all.
1985-01-24	Soviet to Allow Coca-Cola Sale	The Coca-Cola Company said today that it had been given permission to sell Coca-Cola in the Soviet Union this year in a deal that breaks Pepsico Inc.'s monopoly on cola sales there.

1984-12-14	ABC Pulls Diet Coke Commercial Off the Air	The ABC-TV network has pulled a Diet Coke commercial off the air over the question of whether its new drink formulation - with all aspartame and no saccharin - is available nationally, a network source confirmed yesterday. The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta responded that ''as conditions in the marketplace change, it is not uncommon for a network to request further substantiation of claims made in national advertising.''
1984-12-07	BUSINESS PEOPLE ; Former HBO Chief Hired by Coca-Cola	The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that Frank J. Biondi Jr., who resigned in October as chairman and chief executive officer of Time Inc.'s Home Box Office, had been named executive vice president of Coke's Entertainment Business Sector, a new position. The division includes Columbia Pictures Industries and Coca-Cola's share of Tri-Star Pictures Inc., a joint venture of Columbia, CBS Inc. and HBO. Mr. Biondi, 39 years old, said he had no ''predisposed philosophy'' about his new job. ''Coke is committed to being a larger factor in the entertainment industry,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''I guess the first goal will be to determine our game plan, devise a strategy of where we want to go and how.''
1984-11-30	Coke Sweetener	Coca- Cola USA said it would begin using Nutrasweet as the only sweetener in Diet Coke. Brian G. Dyson, senior vice president of the Coca-Cola Company and president of Coca-Cola USA, said using 100 percent Nutrasweet would cost more than blending with saccharin, and the extra cost would be ''shared with our bottlers on an equitable basis.'' Despite the switch to 100 percent Nutrasweet in Diet Coke, the company said it remains committed to the multi-sweetener concept for other soft drinks.
1984-11-19	Market Place; A Major Shift To Corn Syrup	MANY Wall Street analysts are suddenly taking a closer look at the equities of three of the nation's leading producers of corn sweeteners - the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, CPC International and the A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company. Why? On Nov. 6, both the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc., which together represent about two-thirds of the soft-drink industry, approved the 100 percent replacement of sugar with corn sweeteners. Coca-Cola previously had used corn sweeteners in about 75 percent of its product while Pepsi had used about 50 percent. Most other - and much smaller - beverage companies have already switched to corn sweeteners because of its substantial cost savings.
1984-11-07	COKE, PEPSI TO USE MORE CORN SYRUP	Pepsico Inc. and the Coca-Cola Company, the two giants of the soft- drink industry, said in separate announcements yesterday that they would significantly increase the use of a corn-based sweetener in their regular and caffeine-free cola drinks in the United States. Analysts said the decisions underscore the long-building preference of the soft-drink industry for high-fructose corn syrup - which is less expensive than the traditional cane- or beet- based sweetener - as well as the shrinking market of the sugar industry. Pepsico said it would exclusively use high-fructose corn syrup to sweeten its bottled, canned and fountain-drawn Pepsi-Cola and Pepsi- Free soft drinks. Since last year the company, whose headquarters are in Purchase, N.Y., had been using high- fructose corn syrup in 50- and 80-percent ratios in its regular products, a spokesman said.

Revenues for the soft-drink giant advanced 14.8 percent to $2.1 billion, from $1.83 billion. Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive, said soft-drink growth in the Pacific area, particularly Japan, where Diet Coke was recently introduced, was strong. He also said there were gains in another important market, Latin America, mainly as a result of an improved political climate.
1984-10-10	TAB SODA DRINKERS MISS FAMILIAR TASTE	'' NEW and improved'' versions of old and familiar products appear almost daily and at times buyers barely seem to notice. Soft-drink makers blend saccharin with Nutrasweet, and the taste, at first dramatic and different, soon becomes routine. Products come, products go, products change and customers expect it - unless the product is Tab. Ever since Nutrasweet, the brand name for the low-calorie sweetener aspartame, was added to Tab in May, the Coca-Cola Company, which manufactures the diet cola, has been hearing from customers. Nearly 5,000 people have called or written, according to Thomas Mattingly, a company spokesman. Many have praised the taste of new Tab. But the vast majority, Mr. Mattingly said, are letters and calls of complaint.

''We have reached a written agreement with the people Coca-Cola sent down from Atlanta, and we are confident they will live up to it,'' said Rodolfo Robles, head of the 300-member union. ''You can never be certain of anything in this country, but we are hoping this long ordeal is now ending.'' The bottling plant has been closed since February, making Guatemala City perhaps the only capital in the hemisphere other than Havana where Coca-Cola is unavailable. Workers have refused to leave the factory grounds, and say they are determined to stay until the company in Atlanta locates a new owner to take over its franchise here.
1984-06-30	WHEN COKE THROWS A PARTY	In a swank ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel, several Coke bottlers were hurling hoops toward stuffed Teddy bears, trying (and failing) to win prizes. Upstairs, bottlers were dancing to a lively country and western band. Some bottlers were petting the cow resting placidly in a makeshift pen on the second floor. Others were gawking at a 70-foot Coke hot-air balloon that had been squeezed into the lobby. And everyone was partaking of a smorgasbord and talking about, if not necessarily drinking, Coke. ''Man, this is some feed,'' said a Middle Western bottler. His preferred drink seemed to be bourbon.
