2009-03-16	Rated F for Failure	WHEN Standard & Poor's, the bond-rating agency, lowered General Electric's rating to AA+, from AAA, last week, many were shocked at the tarnishing of one of America's most revered corporations. But the real scandal is how long it took S.&P. to make that minor change -- and that the other major ratings firm, Moody's, still hasn't -- even though G.E.'s dividend has been slashed by two-thirds and its stock price had fallen below $7, from nearly $40 a year ago. Why, more than a year into the crisis, do regulators and investors continue to rely on ratings? No one has been more wrong than Moody's and S.&P. Less than a year ago both gave high ratings to 11 of the largest distressed financial institutions. They put the insurance giant A.I.G. in the AA category.

G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., has units and joint ventures in India spanning technology and back-office outsourcing, credit cards, consumer finance, hospitals, aviation and real estate. Mr. Immelt said G.E. would enter the banking sector when the regulatory guidelines changed. SARITHA RAI (NYT)

Next month the PowerLight Corporation, using $75 million of the General Electric Company's money, will begin installing the first of what will be 52,000 solar panels, capable of generating 11 megawatts of electricity -- enough to light and heat 8,000 homes.
2006-04-22	Corrections	A chart in Business Day on April 14 with an article about the effect of a proposed change in pension accounting procedures on businesses misstated the value of General Electric's shareholder equity. It is $109.4 billion, not $11.7 billion.
2006-04-16	Corrections	A chart last Sunday illustrating the relationship of chief executives' pay to company performance in 2005 referred incompletely to financial results at General Electric. The company did report flat earnings from continuing operations and a 46 percent decline in overall earnings, but only in the fourth quarter. For the full year, earnings from continuing operations rose 12 percent, while overall earnings declined 3 percent.
2006-04-14	G.E. Earnings Increase 9%, Matching Wall St. Forecasts	General Electric said yesterday that its earnings increased 9 percent in the first quarter and that revenue rose 10 percent as the company benefited from stronger sales of aircraft engines and health equipment. But the report, which met Wall Street's expectations to the penny, did not excite investors who were hoping the company would raise its earnings forecast for the rest of the year or beat their expectations. Shares closed down 57 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $33.89.
2006-04-09	Corrections	A brief report in the Suits column last Sunday, about a composite picture of General Electric directors in the company's 2005 annual report, described the montage technique incorrectly. G.E. says that while some directors were photographed separately for the composite, pictures of directors' heads were not pasted onto separate pictures of bodies.
2006-04-06	Tina Fey's Brash Bid for Prime Time; 'S.N.L.' Star's Sitcom Pilot Doesn't Spare NBC's Corporate Owner	Someone yelled ''action'' and Alec Baldwin, in a crisp blue suit and white dress shirt, strode briskly onto a set meant to evoke the office of a network television executive under renovation, as sparks flew from a welder's torch. He was playing a fictional character named Jack Donaghy, whose dual title at General Electric, the parent company of NBC, is vice president of East Coast television and microwave oven programming. At the moment, as the cameras rolled, he was dressing down Tina Fey, who was playing the part of Liz, the head writer on a live, prime-time variety show on NBC not unlike the old Carol Burnett program.
2006-04-02	Cutting and Pasting A Corporate Board	The pictures of a dozen outside directors in General Electric's 2005 annual report seem out of sync, as if some of the heads were photographed and then pasted onto the bodies. They were, confirmed a company spokesman, Russell Wilkerson, who said that some photographs had been taken individually and others in small groups. They were then assembled, he said, for a panoramic shot of the powerhouse board, which includes Rochelle B. Lazarus, the chairwoman and chief executive of Ogilvy Mather Worldwide, and Ralph S. Larsen, the former chief executive of Johnson & Johnson. Directors had a 94 percent attendance rate for the 12 board meetings last year, Mr. Wilkerson said, but scheduling conflicts and the hours it takes to set up equipment and lighting made capturing all the directors at one time difficult.
2006-03-26	Waiting for G.E.	Never hold your breath waiting for actual progress in the cleanup of PCB's from the Hudson River. You'll pass out. Milestones in the river's slow recovery have been piling up for decades, at least on paper. But the chemicals haven't gone anywhere. Polychlorinated biphenyls, the toxic chemicals deposited by General Electric factories in the upper river for decades, were banned as a cancer risk in 1977. A long struggle ensued between the company and state and federal agencies over whether and how to deal with contaminated river mud. The Environmental Protection Agency roused itself to begin investigating the issue in 1990, and 10 years later it ordered G.E. to clean up the mess.
2006-03-22	Study Says U.S. Companies Lag on Global Warming	European and Asian companies are paying more attention to global warming than their American counterparts.

About 71 million Genworth Class A shares, valued at $2.3 billion yesterday, will be sold to investors, General Electric said. G.E. will also sell 15 million Class B shares to Genworth at the same price.
2006-02-18	SATURDAY INTERVIEW -- Don Browne; Trying Hard To Be No. 1 In Latino TV	The 41 million Latinos in the United States make up a significant part of the American viewing audience, and media companies are beginning to notice. On Feb. 8, the No. 1 Spanish-language television network, Univision, announced that it was exploring a sale, drawing potential interest from companies, including Viacom and the News Corporation, in what analysts said could be a $13 billion deal. The amount is a far cry from the $2.7 billion paid by General Electric for the No. 2 Spanish-language network, Telemundo, in 2001. Since its purchase, Telemundo has gained on Univision, with 24 percent of the Hispanic viewing audience in January, up from 16 percent a year earlier, according to Nielsen Media Research. Telemundo has developed an original production unit to counter Univision's hold on distribution with ownership of 62 television markets. Recently, Don Browne, president of Telemundo, spoke about Univision's sale and the general media market's focus on a younger, minority viewing market. Following are excerpts: Q. Were you surprised by Univision's decision to explore a sale? A. Not at all. They had been exhibiting a lot of behavior that would indicate that maybe they were for sale, such as reducing their staff. It looked like a company that may be preparing itself for sale. I don't think it surprised anybody. I think it was an affirmation of what we expected. And I think it's a timing issue, probably, for them, and an optimum time to do it. For us, we're not so focused on what they're doing, we're focused on what we're doing. Q. Warner Brothers and CBS recently decided to focus their two broadcast networks, WB and UPN, on a younger, minority market. What does that mean for the general television landscape? A. I think it's interesting. I think the business is consolidating. I think it reinforces, again, that we are involved with a very dynamic audience that is growing and evolving and is attractive to everyone. Everyone is trying to figure out how to get the Spanish-language audience. But it's not so much the Spanish language, it's much more about culture: How do we bring relevance into our product to attract this audience? Q. But advertisers aren't yet paying a premium for this audience. A. But I think that's the beauty of our business. Advertisers are -- it's like a giant that's waking up. I think that advertisers are starting to realize the giant is the U.S. Hispanic population, which is growing dramatically. And I think as they begin to get a sense of the power of that consumer block, we're going to see an acceleration of that general market dollar coming very aggressively into the Spanish-language world. Q. Isn't part of the problem that advertisers have tended to see the audience as a lower-end market? A. I just think it's not necessarily lower end, but lack of awareness of how you market to them. Again, what happened four years ago, when G.E. and NBC bought Telemundo, I think it really sent a significant signal to the marketplace that this is a really important market. I think the fact that Univision is for sale and the buyers that are being mentioned are significant players, I think this is the type of news that will stimulate the general market advertiser to accelerate their dollars into our marketplace. Q. Univision hasn't followed your path in ramping up original production of the popular prime-time telenovellas. Yet, that company is expected to earn a higher price tag. What do you make of that? A. Jeff Immelt made this point the other day: I think the investment in Telemundo G.E. and NBC made four years ago was a brilliant investment. Because Univision is as good as they're going to be. They have nowhere to go, in the sense that they have their supplier, they have their traditional content that they do. Our audience is getting younger and more diverse and is growing faster than theirs. Ours is all upside. They're as good as they're going to be. We're just beginning to be as good as we're going to be. So if you're going to place a bet, you can bet where the business has been or you can bet on an organization that has a system and a program about where the business is going. And that's where we are. We're the future and I believe theirs is a traditional business model that is not appropriate to the future.

2006-02-15	Investors Are Tilting Toward Windmills; G.E. Sees Much to Like In Alternative Energy	It's hard to be in a business where you literally -- as well as figuratively -- are tilting at windmills. But that business may have just gotten its biggest tail wind yet. When President Bush called last month for more effort in alternative energies, a business that last year attracted only about $7 billion in investment nationwide, the 300 engineers and financiers at GE Energy Financial Services were already in the game. But that does not mean they were not happy that the White House acknowledged the sector.
2006-02-14	World Trade Group Rules Tax Benefits by U.S. Illegal	The World Trade Organization ruled yesterday that tax breaks the United States gives to some of its largest companies are illegal and the European Union said it would impose new trade sanctions in three months unless the tax breaks were abolished. The ruling is the second in four years involving tax breaks that the United States granted to 6,000 exporters, including Boeing, Microsoft and General Electric, initially under the Foreign Sales Corporation program and subsequently under the American Jobs Creation Act.
2006-01-21	G.E.'s Earnings Report Shows a Lackluster Quarter	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its earnings from continuing operations in the last quarter of 2005 rose less than 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004, on a revenue increase of 3 percent. It was G.E.'s smallest quarterly profit in more than a year.

''It was my husband's idea,'' said Sheri Henriksen, referring to the matched set she ordered for her family's kitchen in Houston. ''It's strictly convenience. I haven't even thought about the cost.'' If a pair of dishwashers sounds like a setup that belongs in a restaurant, that's just the point. The second machine is the latest addition to kitchens that have been aping their commercial betters for years.
2006-01-05	If Your CD's Double as Coasters, Here's One That Can Take It	Like the LP's of old, recordable compact discs have surfaces that are easily scratched. Most people are not careful and toss discs on the table next to the computer or stereo while swapping them. The discs are often damaged when they are scraped across something hard or rough. But what if you had a disc whose surface never touched that tabletop? Todd Kuchman, founder and chief executive of Scratch-Less Disc Industries, came up with a low-tech fix. He added a series of bumps around the edge of the disc, keeping the surface slightly raised.
2005-12-15	European Court Upholds Veto of G.E.-Honeywell Deal	In a verdict that offered something to both sides, Europe's second-highest court supported the European Commission's rejection of the $42 billion merger of General Electric and Honeywell. But even as it backed the Commission's ruling, the long-awaited decision from the Court of First Instance appeared to make it somewhat harder in the future for Brussels to reject merger proposals.
2005-12-04	A Troubling Memo	We already know why the removal of PCB's from the Hudson River promises to be the largest and most complex environmental cleanup in history -- it has to do with the sheer volume of toxic material buried beneath an enormous, flowing river, and the delicacy of removing the mess without leaving a worse one behind. But does the project have to be history's most frustrating, too? It seems that every time a milestone is reached in the slow, unsteady march toward a cleaner river, the project goes awry. The latest example is the disclosure late last month of a confidential memo finding fault with the plan and casting doubt on whether the polluter, General Electric, intends to honor its historic agreement with the federal government to scrape the river clean.
2005-11-22	Saving the Environment, One Quarterly Earnings Report at a Time	A few years ago, scientists at Cargill Inc. learned how to make rigid, transparent plastics from corn sugars. There was just one problem: they cost a lot more than the oil-based plastics they would replace. But that was before the price of oil shot up and companies came under pressure from consumers and investors to find economically sound ways to adopt ''green'' packaging and other environmentally friendly products and processes. This year, Wal-Mart, Wild Oats Market and many other retailers, as well as food suppliers like Del Monte and Newman's Own Organics, all embraced corn-based packaging for fresh produce.
2005-11-21	Internal Federal Memo Casts Doubts on Hudson Cleanup	A federal conservation official has raised serious doubts about the recently approved plan to scrape hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of hazardous chemicals from the bottom of the Hudson River, and raised the possibility that the long-delayed cleanup may never be completed. The official, a coastal resources expert in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a confidential memo that General Electric intends to leave substantial amounts of contaminants in the river, capping them with additional material rather than removing them. But the cap could be washed away in a storm, releasing the remaining PCB's beneath, the memo said.
2005-11-19	G.E. to Sell Insurance Business To Swiss Re	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it was selling its troubled reinsurance business for $6.8 billion to Swiss Re, which will become the largest company in the world selling insurance to insurance companies. The insurance business has been ''a tough strategic fit for G.E.,'' said Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company's chief executive, who wants to focus on faster-growing sectors. Over the last five years, he said, G.E.'s main insurance unit has lost $700 million and required the infusion of $3.2 billion.
2005-11-03	G.E. Expects More Savings	General Electric said yesterday that it expected as much as $1.2 billion in savings next year, four times earlier estimates, as a result of the consolidation of its operations into six business units. The savings will come in part from streamlining administrative functions, a vice chairman, David L. Calhoun, said at a meeting in Cincinnati.
2005-10-25	Wal-Mart To Seek Savings In Energy	Wal-Mart's chief executive is set to announce on Tuesday a set of sweeping, specific environmental goals to reduce energy use in its stores, double its trucks' fuel efficiency, minimize its use of packaging and pressure thousands of companies in its worldwide supply chain to follow its lead. Embracing energy-conscious and environmentally conscious goals will help both the company's bottom line and its customers' needs, H. Lee Scott said in an interview Monday.
2005-10-21	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: G.E. Buys Stake in a Bank	GE Consumer Finance, the consumer-lending unit of General Electric, said it would buy a stake in the Shenzhen Development Bank of China. The G.E. unit will buy newly issued shares in the bank for $100 million, the company said. The purchase will bring Shenzhen Development's foreign ownership to the 25 percent limit imposed by China's government.
2005-10-16	A Commitment on PCB's	General Electric has at long last committed itself to removing PCB's from the Hudson River. It signed an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency on Oct. 6 to begin dredging mud from the river in the spring of 2007. That's a first for the company, which has long resisted cleaning up the last and most stubborn stain from an industrial era that has largely, and thankfully, vanished from the river's edge. Decades after PCB's were found to be the river's most serious environmental threat, and years after scientific studies produced a consensus that dredging was the best way to restore the Hudson to health, a consent decree on a $700 million cleanup qualifies as huge news -- unless it's just a deceptive reassertion of a frustrating status quo, in which G.E. continues a timeworn pattern of grinding delay that has led to the shifting of tons of paperwork but of hardly any toxic mud.
2005-10-15	G.E. Reports Big Gains In Earnings And Revenue	The General Electric Company, making good on its promise last week of stellar third-quarter earnings, said yesterday that its profit for the quarter was up 15 percent on revenue that rose 9 percent, and that the fourth quarter and next year were shaping up to be highly profitable. ''You are going to see some massively good numbers in the future,'' Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman, told analysts in a conference call.
2005-10-07	G.E. Commits to Dredging 43 Miles of Hudson River	Nearly three decades after PCB's were discovered in the upper Hudson River, General Electric made a binding agreement yesterday to dredge them from the river in one of the largest and most expensive industrial cleanups in history. The agreement appears to end years of resistance by G.E. and initiates a process in which the company could eventually spend hundreds of millions of dollars to remove PCB's from 43 miles of river bottom stretching from Hudson Falls to Troy.
2005-10-04	Program Offers Health Care For Some Part-Time Workers	Dozens of part-time workers at six large companies have begun to sign up for low-cost, limited health benefits in a new national program for uninsured employees. The HR Policy Association, a nonprofit organization of senior personnel executives, said enrollment was under way at units of General Electric, I.B.M., Sears, Avon Products, the computer-storage company EMC and the auto supplier Federal-Mogul.
2005-10-03	Just Hold The Memoir And Pass The Advice	John F. Welch Jr.'s image as the iconic American chief executive took a hit when his second wife, Jane Beasley Welch, revealed the goody basket of corporate perks he walked away with -- from free rent for a Manhattan apartment to flowers and reimbursement for cleaning bills -- when he retired from the General Electric Corporation. But that hasn't stopped people from wanting Mr. Welch's business advice.
2005-09-28	Juan Valdez and the Gecko Are Consumer Favorites	Four advertising characters and slogans have been named to the Madison Avenue Walk of Fame after a vote by consumers. The results of the vote were announced yesterday as part of Advertising Week 2005, a series of industry events that runs through Friday. The characters that won, selected from a field of 26, were Juan Valdez, the longtime representative of growers of Colombian coffee, and the Geico insurance gecko.
2005-08-26	World Business Briefing | Europe: Turkey: G.E. to Buy Stake in Garanti Bank	General Electric agreed to pay $1.56 billion for a stake in Turkiye Garanti Bankasi, the third-biggest publicly traded lender in Turkey, where consumer borrowing almost doubled in the past year. General Electric's consumer finance unit will buy 25.5 percent of the bank from Dogus Holding in a deal valuing Garanti at $6.1 billion, according to a statement from the bank's family-controlled holding company.
2005-08-08	NBC Universal Aims to Be Prettiest Feather in G.E.'s Cap	NBC Universal is readying for a second act nearly two years after being hatched in a $43 billion merger of NBC, owned by the General Electric Company, and Vivendi Universal. Bob Wright, the chairman and chief executive of NBC Universal, is the first to say that all has not gone according to script at the media company. But if things play out according to Mr. Wright's latest rewrite, the managerial wizardry of G.E. will be applied to demonstrate how a world-beating media giant can be built from a suddenly diminished prime-time television powerhouse and a solid, but middling, movie studio.
2005-08-07	The Dredge Report	Anyone who would move mountains must first overcome the problem of inertia, and be prepared to expend enormous effort just to get things rolling. General Electric, a mountain of a company, knows this well, which is one reason the cleanup of the pollutants it dumped years ago into the Hudson River has moved so slowly. Under a dredging plan devised during the Clinton administration and ratified in 2001 by Christie Whitman, administrator of President Bush's Environmental Protection Agency, the first scoops of soil laden with toxic PCB's were to have been lifted from the river bottom this past spring. That was delayed to next summer, and then, in late June, the work was put off yet again, to 2007 at the earliest.
2005-07-27	Moving Into the Neighborhood	When Robert J. Amsdell decided to build a ministorage site in western Pennsylvania in the early 1970's, the concept was so new that even his banker was mystified. Back then, moving companies provided temporary storage for customers who were relocating, but did not give them ready access to their belongings. ''He said, 'The whole thing doesn't make sense to me, but if you're willing to sign for it personally, we'll give you the money,''' said Mr. Amsdell, now the chairman and chief executive of U-Store-It, a company based here that went public as a real estate investment trust in October.
2005-07-25	A New Worry for Investors: Retirees' Medical Benefits	As double-digit inflation in health care siphons more and more cash from old-line companies with generous benefits, big investors are growing wary. ''Rapidly rising health care costs depress the returns of our pension fund,'' said George Diehr, a health benefits official at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, with more than $180 billion in assets.
2005-07-25	Stung by Last Season, NBC Sees More Tough Times Ahead	In an effort to lower expectations for the coming television season, Kevin Reilly, the president of entertainment for NBC, told reporters at a news conference here Sunday that the network might not achieve any ratings improvements soon, and said that NBC was altering the outlook for its financial prospects. ''This season may not see a turnaround for us,'' Mr. Reilly said.
2005-07-18	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Saturday about General Electric's international sales efforts misstated the company's 2001 earnings. They were $13.684 billion, not $30 billion.
2005-07-17	The Blurry Boundaries Of Growth and Value	HERE'S a tip for followers of investment fashion: Growth is the new value. That is the advice of portfolio managers who believe that the five-year run of underperformance for growth stocks has left them more attractively valued than so-called value stocks. In their view, growth stocks are due for a turnaround, one that recent share price movement suggests may have already begun.
2005-07-16	Instant Infrastructure; G.E. Becomes a General Store for Developing Countries	Last month, officials from Vietnam called on David L. Calhoun, who runs General Electric's brand new infrastructure unit. They huddled in a room at the Waldorf-Astoria to go over a fairly formidable shopping list. The delegation left without placing an order, but Mr. Calhoun said, ''I'm pretty sure we're going to get a near-term hit in airplanes, and a longer-term hit in energy.'' Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, is clearly counting on him to get multiple hits, and from multiple countries. For the first time, G.E. has rolled aircraft engines, rail products, water, energy, oil and gas equipment, and even some finance units, into one all-encompassing collection of businesses, aimed at helping developing countries come of age.
2005-07-16	Double-Digit Earnings Growth Posted by All of G.E.'s Units	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its revenue for the second quarter rose 13 percent, to $41.56 billion, and that its earnings jumped 24 percent, to $4.6 billion or 44 cents a share, in line with analysts' expectations. The report is the last one in which G.E., which reorganized into six businesses on July 5, will break out results for 11 separate businesses. The old structure is going out on a high note: For the first time in more than two years, each of the 11 units reported double-digit earnings growth.
2005-07-07	Specs: A Boxful of Savings	TO keep construction costs at $228,000, or $190 a square foot, Bates Masi Architects of Sag Harbor, N.Y., shunned status appliances and cabinetry in favor of brands like General Electric and Ikea. The contractor, Seacoast Construction, 46 Bellhaven Road, Bellport, N.Y., (631)827-7850, built the house with industrial shelving and lights. The prefab guts of the living room fireplace were $1,800 from Home Crafts, 760 Railroad Avenue, West Babylon, N.Y., (631)669-0141. The mantel, hearth and surround are honed bluestone; $1,800 from Barrasso & Sons, 160 Floral Park Street, Islip Terrace, N.Y., (631)581-0360.
2005-07-03	Working in a Coal Mine: Lord I Am So Tired, but Good-Looking	MOST people tend to think of coal mining as a dangerous, dirty business. But General Electric, as part of its Ecomagination campaign, is trying to change that. And in a hopelessly conflicted new ad, G.E. is using some powerful explosives: glistening bodies, a soothing message and archness so extreme that it ends up backfiring. As the spot begins, we hear Tennessee Ernie Ford's ''Sixteen Tons'' and see shadowy figures, identifiable only by their helmet lights, walking into a coal mine. (The helmet light, like the physician's reflector, remains indispensable to commercials that don't have a lot of time for explanations.) At first, this ad looks like a paean to labor -- the song after all, is a workingman's lament -- and we see several strong and stylized male figures that bring to mind W.P.A. murals.
2005-06-26	When a Wine Collection Outgrows the Rack	AFTER collecting wine for five years, Robert Chess was having trouble negotiating all the wine crates and overloaded wine racks in the basement of his home in Cranberry Township, Pa., near Pittsburgh. ''It was hard to find anything,'' said Mr. Chess, a certified financial planner. And the conditions down there were not the constant 55 degrees and 75 percent humidity recommended for aging the expensive Bordeaux and Burgundy vintages that he and his wife, Laura, enjoy. So last year they transformed most of their basement into a climate-controlled wine cellar, with a capacity of 2,200 bottles. With its foam-insulated, moisture-resistant walls, mahogany racks, cork flooring and adjoining tasting area, the space is both functional and enjoyable, Mr. Chess said. ''It protects my investment, and we have a great time entertaining down there.''
2005-06-24	G.E. Realigns Its 11 Businesses Into 6 and Shuffles Executives	General Electric reorganized its vast operations from 11 businesses into 6 yesterday, promoting three young executives to vice chairmen to run its three biggest operations in a move specifically aimed at keeping them from being hired away. The promotions will reduce the number of executives reporting directly to G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, who, since taking the top job in 2001, had been extremely hands-on, said Ralph S. Larsen, a G.E. director and chairman of the board's management development and compensation committee.
2005-06-12	Talking Green, Acting Dirty	THE General Electric Company is trying to package itself as a company that cares about the environment. To those of us who have spent our careers protecting the environment, this would be a bad joke if there were not serious health consequences involved. Last month, General Electric announced its ''ecomagination'' initiative, presenting itself as a provider of environmental and energy technology. In rolling out this strategy, Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric's chief executive, called on the Bush administration to articulate a clear national policy on global warming.
2005-06-09	Diller Stake In NBC Unit Is Being Sold	IAC/InteractiveCorp, controlled by Barry Diller, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its 5.4 percent stake in Vivendi Universal Entertainment for about $3.4 billion, ending a fractious partnership and allowing Mr. Diller to focus on his Internet businesses. Vivendi Universal Entertainment is part of NBC Universal, which is 8o percent owned by General Electric and 20 percent owned by Vivendi Universal. NBC Universal is putting up roughly $900 million to buy Mr. Diller's stake in the entertainment unit, which includes cable networks, Universal Pictures and other assets. The rest of the money is coming from Vivendi Universal, and the deal resolves its legal dispute with Mr. Diller over tax liability issues.
2005-06-07	Black, White or Gray; Statistics and Emotions Clash in Corporate Bias Cases	Marcel T. Thomas, the chief executive of GE Aviation Materials, has been promoted three times since he joined the General Electric Company in 2001. His base salary of $205,000 ranks him 18th among 314 United States-based executives in his grade level at GE Transportation, his unit's parent company. Until this year he has received stellar evaluations and hefty bonuses. But this year, despite a big increase in his unit's sales and profits, he received a low rating and a negligible compensation increase. Mr. Thomas is black, and he believes that his treatment is a result of racial discrimination.
2005-05-31	G.E. to Help Restart Power Plant in India	General Electric will team up with two state-owned Indian companies to find ways to restart the Dabhol power plant, which has been shut down since 2001, the company said Monday. Scott R. Bayman, president of GE India, said in a statement that his company would join with officials from National Thermal Power and Bharat Heavy Electricals to ''determine a course of action for restarting and completing the Dabhol Power Project.''
2005-05-30	At CNBC, Only the Boss Is Allowed to Own Stock	Four months ago, CNBC began enforcing tough rules that barred its managers and news staff, as well as their spouses and dependents, from owning individual securities. The idea was to avoid potential conflicts of interest in its news coverage, and, despite a bit of grumbling, employees went along. But on May 18, when word got around that the network chairwoman, Pamela Thomas-Graham, had taken a seat on the board of Idenix Pharmaceuticals along with 15,000 stock options and some additional compensation, newsroom grumbling turned into groans.
2005-05-28	Chief Sees Surge in G.E. Business in India	Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said Friday that he expected G.E.'s revenue in India to leap to more than $5 billion by 2010 from $800 million now. Describing India as a ''rising star,'' Mr. Immelt said on a two-day visit that General Electric would aggressively expand in India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with new investment in financial services and manufacturing.
2005-05-26	The Chrysler After-Party	THE Art Deco Society of New York, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, is the host of the World Congress on Art Deco, which takes place every two years in a different city. Several of the events will be open to the public, starting with a symposium today, held at the Proschansky Auditorium at CUNY Graduate Center, Fifth Avenue at 34th Street, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Speakers will include Carol Willis, the director of the Skyscraper Museum of New York, who will talk about Art Deco skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center, and Sandra Cohen-Rose, the author of ''Northern Deco: Art Deco Architecture in Montreal'' (Corona, 1996). The fee for the symposium is $50. Two programs will be offered at the Museum of the City of New York (1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street). The first is a gallery tour of ''Glamour, New York Style,'' an exhibition at the museum through July 4. The tour, by Phyllis Magidson, the curator of the exhibition, will include such designers as Chanel, Christian Dior, Gilbert Adrian and Madeleine Vionnet. This tour will be offered today at 4:30 and 5:15 p.m. The second event at the museum is a talk by David Garrard Lowe, the author of ''Art Deco New York'' (Watson-Guptill, 2004), on Saturday at 2 p.m. The programs at the museum are free with admission of $7 (students and those 62 and older, $5). For information: (212)534-1672.
2005-05-23	MARKETING: The Advertising Column; No More Same-Old	BBDO Worldwide in New York, General Electric's longtime advertising agency, was not getting the message. The agency had been offering G.E. its panoply of traditional marketing ideas, leaning heavily on the standard 30-second television spot. But Judy Hu, general manager for global advertising and branding at G.E., demanded something daring. What she eventually got fit the bill: an online campaign with a virtual sprouting seed that computer users can tend and send to people they know by e-mail.
2005-05-19	Climate Signals	Hardly a week goes by without somebody telling President Bush that his passive approach to global warming is hopelessly behind the times, that asking industry for voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions won't work and that what's needed is a regulatory regime that asks sacrifices of everyone. He's heard this from his political allies here and abroad -- from Tony Blair, George Pataki and Arnold Schwarzenegger, to name three -- and now he is hearing it from the heaviest hitters in the business world, including, most recently, Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. Mr. Immelt runs the biggest company in America, and for that reason some environmental groups hailed his speech last week on climate change as a tipping point in the global warming debate. Mr. Immelt chose his words carefully and did not directly criticize Mr. Bush. But he left no doubt that he believes mandatory controls on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, are necessary and inevitable. And he said he would double investments by G.E. in energy and environmental technologies to prepare it for what he sees as a huge global market for products that help other companies -- and countries like China and India -- reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
2005-05-18	Chief of Unit Files Lawsuit Accusing G.E. Of Racial Bias	A chief executive of a unit of General Electric filed a lawsuit yesterday accusing G.E. of underpaying African-American managers, denying them promotions and retaliating when they raise objections. He is seeking $450 million in damages. G.E. denied the accusations and said it would seek to have the suit dismissed.
2005-05-10	G.E. Chief Urges U.S. to Adopt Clearer Energy Policy	The chief executive of the General Electric Company, Jeffrey R. Immelt, pushed the company squarely into the global warming debate on Monday, asking the government for a clear energy policy and saying later in an interview that he expected Washington to eventually impose controls on carbon emissions. ''If you look to the future, there is going to be a day when we have standards of some kind pertaining to carbon,'' he said. ''I think most business people are planning for that implicitly, even without anything that's overt.'' The Bush administration has opposed such controls.
2005-05-08	The View's Still Great From the Corner Office	WITH so many celebrity chief executives spending more time in courtrooms than in boardrooms these days, the race for the corner office may seem to be losing its appeal.
2005-05-07	G.E. to Restate Income (Higher, Not Lower)	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it would restate its income for the last three years because of technical violations of rules for accounting for gains and losses in contracts for derivatives. The restatement will result in an earnings increase of $381 million, about 0.6 percent of the $65 billion that G.E. made during that period. G.E. executives said that its internal auditors had already begun a review of its derivatives accounting when the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted the company in January, informing it of an informal investigation into the matter and requesting documents.
2005-05-07	Not the Week To Be or to Own The Bluest Chips	It was a week to give owners of blue chips the blues. The greatest names of American capitalism seemed to vie with one another to see which company could have the most depressing news. General Electric joined the parade yesterday, revealing that its auditors had discovered that, for the last three years, it had failed to apply correctly an accounting rule and would have to restate its financial results.
2005-04-23	SPIEGEL TO GET LOAN TO EXIT BANKRUPTCY	Spiegel, the mail-order company operating under bankruptcy protection, agreed to borrow $300 million from J.P. Morgan Chase & Company, the General Electric Company and Credit Suisse First Boston to pay creditors under a plan to exit bankruptcy. J.P. Morgan will provide $150 million, G.E.'s finance unit will provide $90 million and Credit Suisse First Boston will provide $60 million, the company said in papers filed Thursday with the United States Bankruptcy Court in New York. The loan is the final piece of Spiegel's plan to exit bankruptcy by giving ownership of the company to Commerzbank and other unsecured creditors. Spiegel is based in Downers Grove, Ill.
2005-04-23	CONFLICTING ROLES PROMPT RESIGNATION FROM G.M. BOARD	General Motors said yesterday that Alan G. Lafley had resigned from its board because he was also a director of the General Electric Company, which competes with G.M. in financial services. Mr. Lafley, 57, who is chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company, left after a periodic assessment required under antitrust law, G.M. said. The automaker said Erskine Bowles, 59, who was White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, had been nominated for the board. Mr. Lafley joined G.M.'s board in August 2001 and became a General Electric director in October 2002. Mr. Bowles will be among 12 nominees for election to the board at the June 7 annual meeting.
2005-04-16	G.E. Says Earnings Jumped 25% in the First Quarter	The General Electric Company said yesterday that earnings increased 25 percent in the first quarter, led by its entertainment and health care units and strong growth across most of its businesses. Net income grew to $4.04 billion, or 38 cents a share, for the quarter from $3.24 billion, or 32 cents, a year ago. Revenue jumped 19 percent, to $39.8 billion, from $33.4 billion. Nine of G.E.'s 11 businesses reported double-digit growth in the first quarter.
2005-04-04	MediaTalk; A Cross-Promotion Takes Newsweek Further Down-Market Than You'd Imagine	It must have come as a surprise to some readers of In Touch Weekly when the magazine implied that they could get more information than they already had in their hands. ''Get all the news,'' a full-page ad in the April 4 issue said. ''26 issues of In Touch and 26 issues of Newsweek. All for just $39.97.''
2005-04-01	G.E. IN VENTURE WITH CHINESE MAKER OF UTILITY CONTROLS	General Electric said yesterday that it had formed a joint venture with Shanghai Xin Hua Control Technologies Company to expand production of power plant control systems in China. G.E. Energy bought a majority share in Xin Hua Control Engineering Company, a maker of steam turbines and power plant control systems and software, to form the venture, General Electric said. Terms were not disclosed. General Electric is based in Fairfield, Conn.
2005-03-15	U.S. Power Producers Window-Shop For Latest Models of Nuclear Reactors	Like the taxis in Havana, American nuclear power reactors are in heavy use, important to the economy and really, really old. The most modern was ordered in 1973. Now after decades, four huge electric companies are expressing strong interest in new reactors, and they would like a new plant to reflect some of what has been learned of the operation.
2005-03-15	GENERAL ELECTRIC TO SELL SHARES IN INSURANCE UNIT	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it planned to sell as much as $2.84 billion of shares in its life and mortgage insurance unit, Genworth Financial, as it shifted resources to consumer and commercial finance. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., said it planned to sell as many as 80.5 million Genworth shares, and that Genworth, based in Richmond, Va., would repurchase $500 million of its shares from G.E. The transactions will cut G.E.'s ownership of Genworth to about 52 percent. G.E. said it planned to continue reducing its stake in Genworth as it pared insurance units in favor of faster-growing businesses.
2005-03-10	Corrections	A front-page article on Tuesday about the resignation of Harry C. Stonecipher as chief executive of the Boeing Company misstated the circumstances of another highly visible departure -- that of John F. Welch Jr. from the General Electric Company. Mr. Welch, who had been chairman and chief executive, retired; he did not resign. His retirement was not connected to the disclosure of details of his compensation package, covering many personal expenses; that disclosure came out in divorce proceedings after his retirement.
2005-02-06	Hudson River PCB's	To the Editor ''New Worries on the Hudson'' (editorial, Jan. 23) stated that the Environmental Protection Agency is proceeding with the PCB cleanup with General Electric ''footing the bill.'' Still worrisome is that G.E. has not yet agreed to pay for or implement the cleanup plan and continues its legal challenge of the federal Superfund law. Dredging must be done carefully to meet protective air standards. But there is no evidence that PCB's in the air that may be causing respiratory problems are coming from river sediments. Recent study results underscore the importance of cleaning up the Upper Hudson PCB-contaminated floodplains, forgotten Upper Hudson Valley PCB dumpsites and G.E.'s plants, as well as other PCB contamination along the Hudson.
2005-01-27	60 Companies Plan to Sponsor Health Coverage For Uninsured	In a novel attempt to extend health coverage to uninsured workers, 60 large employers are joining together to sponsor an array of low-cost health insurance options. The program, to begin in the fall, will be offered for at least two years and is intended to cover uninsured part-time and temporary workers, contractors, consultants and early retirees, who typically are not eligible for employer health plans. The sponsors, which include General Electric, I.B.M., McDonald's and Sears, Roebuck, will begin promoting the low-cost plans in April and May to 3 million eligible workers, about 7 percent of the 45 million uninsured Americans. They hope that several hundred thousand people will sign up at the start.
2005-01-23	New Worries on the Hudson	Whenever we hear the words Hudson River and PCB's, our ears perk up and our hearts prepare to sink. Like most of those who have been eagerly awaiting the day when the river's lingering chemical stain is finally erased, we are accustomed to bad news. It is discouraging enough that tons of General Electric pollutants have soiled the riverbed for decades, poisoning fish and threatening people. They should have been dredged up years ago, but lawsuits, squabbles, bureaucratic complications and procedural difficulties have delayed the cleanup again and again. The Environmental Protection Agency, with G.E. footing the bill, currently plans to start work next summer -- assuming that nothing else happens to further postpone what will be one of the largest industrial cleanups in American history.
2005-01-22	G.E. Earnings Rise 18%; Strong Gains in Most Units	The General Electric Company, citing robust growth in almost all of its major business units, reported record fourth-quarter earnings yesterday. G.E. earned $5.4 billion, or 51 cents a share, an 18 percent increase from the $4.56 billion, or 45 cents a share, it earned in the last quarter of 2003.
2005-01-20	Cargo Containers' Electronic Sensor Says 'Do Not Disturb'	MILLIONS of cargo containers full of toys, TV's and other consumer products stream into United States ports each year. But security experts fear the metal boxes could also be used to transport dangerous freight: terrorist weapons. Researchers are working on modifications to the rugged containers, adding electronic monitoring that can keep track of intrusions once the boxes are sealed at a factory and on their way by train, truck and ship.
2005-01-18	G.E. BUYS PART OF FIRST DATA'S MASTERCARD BUSINESS	The First Data Corporation, the world's largest processor of credit card payments, has agreed to sell its portfolio of Canadian small-business MasterCards to GE Consumer Finance, a unit of the General Electric Company. First Data, based in Denver, will service the accounts after the sale, the company said. GE Consumer Finance, which provides credit services to consumers, retailers and auto dealers in 41 countries, is one of 12 companies that issue MasterCards in Canada. General Electric is based in Stamford, Conn.
2005-01-16	The Swimsuit Interview	I WAS a corporate brat. My father worked for General Electric, and by the time I reached college I had attended 13 schools. My mother tells a story of our fourth move, which was to Syracuse. I was about 10 at the time. We arrived from Phoenix in winter. I pulled on my boots and started going up and down the street, introducing myself to everyone. I thought the introductions would go faster that way. People on the street were very open and interested and very much surprised. It wasn't until I was in high school that I started to make sports teams. My father didn't have the time to be a Little League coach, and I never seemed to make the team I wanted to. In high school I played tennis, baseball, was on the ski team and the football team. There was one sport for every season.
2004-12-15	G.E. Expects Profit Rise of Up to 17% Next Year	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it expected profit to rise as much as 17 percent next year as its revamped portfolio of faster-growing businesses drives sales. Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said in a presentation to investors in New York that the company expected double-digit growth in 10 of its 11 main business units next year. ''We really think we have today a stronger and faster-growing G.E.,'' he said.
2004-12-12	Restarting a Reactor With a Flawed Part; A Pump That Bangs 'Like a Freight Train' Worries Scientists and New Jersey Regulators	Managers of the Salem nuclear power station want to restart a troubled reactor later this month, even though New Jersey regulators have objected and an internal company report warn that flaws in a critical pump could cause an accident. Restarting the reactor at the giant plant in southwestern New Jersey will require the approval of federal regulators. Officials of the plant's operator, P.S.E.G. Nuclear L.L.C., said that restarting the plant would pose no danger to the public and that contingency plans had been drawn up should the pump fail.
2004-12-11	G.E. TO BUY BACK STOCK AND RAISE DIVIDEND	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it would buy back as much as $15 billion in stock over three years and raise its dividend by 10 percent. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., said its quarterly dividend would increase to 22 cents a share, payable on Jan. 25 to shareholders of record Dec. 27. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, said the company's shift into faster-growing industrial businesses and more profitable financial services sectors should produce earnings growth of at least 10 percent starting next year. G.E. shares rose 67 cents, to $36.69.
2004-12-09	PARMALAT USA FILES PLAN TO EXIT BANKRUPTCY	The Parmalat USA Corporation, the United States unit of Italy's largest food company, filed a plan to exit bankruptcy by continuing its business in New York and two other states and liquidating the rest of its assets. General Electric Capital Public Finance, a unit of General Electric and a creditor, would receive 80 percent of the common stock in the subsidiary Farmland Dairies, which would continue to sell milk in New York, New Jersey and Michigan, according to papers filed in United States Bankruptcy Court in New York. Parmalat USA would liquidate its remaining assets, including its Atlanta business.
2004-11-30	Judge Dismisses Big Rights Suit On Apartheid	A federal judge in New York dismissed a human rights suit yesterday against 35 major corporations that did business in South Africa under apartheid, dealing a blow to rights lawyers who have sought to use an 18th-century law to punish international companies that operated under abusive systems. The ruling, by Judge John E. Sprizzo of Federal District Court in Manhattan, came in response to suits originally brought in 2002 by three separate groups of plaintiffs in eight different federal courts across the country. They argued that the corporations, most of which are American, violated international law by actively helping to support the apartheid system.
2004-11-25	G.E. TO ACQUIRE IONICS FOR $1.1 BILLION	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Ionics Inc. for $1.1 billion in cash to take advantage of rising demand for water purification and treatment in developing countries. Investors in Ionics, which is based in Watertown, Mass., will receive $44 a share, a 48 percent premium over the company's closing price on Tuesday. General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., said the purchase would add desalination and filtration to its industrial water treatment business. G.E. said it would now be able to accelerate research on water-purification technology while expanding financing for customers of Ionics in China and the Middle East. Shares of General Electric fell 17 cents, to $35.64. Ionics surged $13.53, or 45.5 percent, to $43.28.
2004-11-17	Heart Scanner Stirs New Hope And a Debate	What if doctors had a new way to diagnose heart disease that took only seconds and provided pictures so clear it showed every clogged artery, so detailed that it was like holding a living heart in your hand? In fact, that new way exists and is coming into use in scattered areas of the country, and there is wide agreement that it will revolutionize cardiology.
2004-11-16	GENERAL ELECTRIC WILL BUY SAFETY UNIT FROM SPX	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Edwards Systems Technology business of the SPX Corporation for $1.4 billion in cash to add fire detection and building safety systems to its three-year-old security unit. General Electric will get ''significant'' cost savings, said William Woodburn, chief executive of GE Infrastructure, the unit buying Edwards. SPX, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said that it would use the proceeds to pay debt and buy back stock. General Electric will be able to broaden its security offerings and tap what it estimates is a $15 billion industry for fire and building-system products. General Electric is based in Fairfield, Conn.
2004-11-10	From Star Broker's Defection, a War of Loyalties	On Wall Street, it is bad enough when a brokerage firm loses one of its most successful brokers to a rival. But when he threatens to take the prestigious account of John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman of General Electric, with him, the loss is potentially much more painful. That is the predicament Merrill Lynch executives have been in since Friday, when a star broker, John T. Fitzpatrick, bolted across Midtown Manhattan to the brokerage arm of UBS, formerly PaineWebber. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who is in his early 40's and a former colleague of Peter E. Bacanovic, Martha Stewart's broker, managed more than $1 billion for rich investors, including Mr. Welch, according to people who know him.
2004-11-09	General Electric Sells 60% Of Indian Back-Office Unit	The General Electric Company said on Monday that it had sold a 60 percent stake in its pioneering back-office unit in India to two private equity firms for $500 million. G.E. sold the majority stake to General Atlantic Partners and Oak Hill Capital Partners, and will keep the remaining 40 percent. The sale opens the unit to accepting work from companies other than G.E. and its subsidiaries.
2004-11-04	I.R.S. Loses Another Ruling on Tax Shelters	A federal judge has dealt another blow to the Internal Revenue Service in its battle against questionable tax shelters, ordering the agency to refund to a private entity controlled by General Electric more than $62 million stemming from a transaction the I.R.S. had deemed a sham. Judge Stefan R. Underhill of the United States District Court of Connecticut said in a ruling on Monday that a G.E.-controlled entity named TIFD III-E was entitled to the refund because of its work as the main tax partner of a commercial aircraft-leasing partnership. The partnership, Castle Harbour I-Limited Liability Company, was set up in 1993 by GE Capital, a unit of General Electric.
2004-11-02	G.E. DELAYS BUYING INVISION FOR 2 MONTHS TO ALLOW INQUIRY	General Electric has agreed to delay its $900 million purchase of InVision Technologies for two months while federal officials look into InVision's disclosure of possible improper payments by international distributors. The extension, until Dec. 27, was an indication that both sides are committed to the merger, an InVision spokeswoman, Laura Graves, and a G.E. spokesman, Jeff Demarrais, said. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., agreed in March to buy InVision, the biggest supplier of bomb-detection machines for airports. The companies agreed that the transaction would not be completed until there had been a resolution with the Justice Department. InVision is based in Newark, Calif.
2004-10-14	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Airline Selects Engine Maker	The Japanese airline All Nippon Airways chose Rolls-Royce to supply engines for 50 Boeing 7E7 jets that will go into service from 2008. The deal, which Nippon valued at $1 billion based on the engine's list price, is a setback for General Electric, which was competing to supply engines for the 7E7, a medium-range jet. Boeing chose Rolls-Royce and General Electric to make engines for the jet and left it to airlines to select the manufacturer. All Nippon said it based its decision on the Rolls-Royce engine's fuel efficiency as well as noise and emission levels. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-10-11	A Senator's Outrage Delays Passage of Corporate Tax Bill	The Senate cleared a path on Sunday for a bill to hand out about $140 billion in corporate tax breaks, but it was blocked from a final vote by a fight over a provision aimed at helping reservists on duty in Iraq. The 633-page bill, which has already been passed by the House, is loaded with hundreds of provisions that provide benefits to a wide range of interests, including the General Electric Company, oil drillers, shipbuilders, cruise ship operators, importers of ceiling fans, corn farmers, tobacco farmers and even foreign gamblers.
2004-10-10	Birds and Bees? No, Let's Talk About Dollars and Cents	DEAR Tommy, I hope that you are well and especially that your football season is going well. It must be difficult to be injured so close to the beginning of the schedule. I hope you are studying. Eleventh grade is a terribly important year.
2004-10-09	Universal Cancels Film With Oscar Stars	A costly last-minute decision by Universal Studios to pull the plug on a film in which two Oscar-winning actors were to star has bruised egos and images as the studio adjusts to the scrutiny of its new corporate parent, General Electric. The movie, ''American Gangster,'' was meant to reunite the director Antoine Fuqua with Denzel Washington, who in 2002 won the Oscar for best actor in Mr. Fuqua's film ''Training Day.'' Mr. Washington's co-star was to be Benicio Del Toro, who won as best supporting actor in 2001 for ''Traffic.'' But after firing Mr. Fuqua several days ago, the studio canceled the entire production late this week, less than a month before filming was scheduled to begin in New York City.
2004-10-07	Negotiators Approve Big Tax Cuts For Business	In an act of pre-election largess, House and Senate negotiators approved a sprawling corporate tax bill on Wednesday that would shower corporations and farmers in politically sensitive states with about $145 billion worth of new tax cuts. In an attempt to get backing from Southern Democrats, Republican leaders included a $10 billion buyout for tobacco farmers to be paid for by taxpayers, but they rejected a Senate provision to link that buyout with a requirement that cigarette companies be subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration.
2004-09-27	Six Sigma: A Hollywood Studio Learns the G.E. Way	On a morning in February, more than 40 executives huddled around a U-shaped table on the eighth floor of Universal Pictures headquarters here to discuss the marketing for their coming spring lineup. Among them was Bob Wright, who found himself debating a television commercial for the remake of ''Dawn of the Dead'' and critiquing the press junket for ''Chronicles of Riddick.'' Mr. Wright, the chairman of NBC Universal, a division of General Electric, which acquired Universal Studios in May, has been as ubiquitous these days as flashbulbs on a red carpet. He has toured the production lot, cornering Stacey Snider, Universal Pictures' chairwoman, at a meeting and peppering her with questions about how the studio greenlights movies.
2004-09-24	G.E. Settles S.E.C. Case On Welch Retirement Perks	General Electric and the Securities and Exchange Commission have settled accusations that the company failed to describe fully the substantial compensation that its former chairman and chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., received after he retired, the commission said yesterday. Under the settlement, G.E. agreed to describe all such perks in the future. The company did not admit or deny the S.E.C.'s accusations.
2004-09-23	The Womb as Photo Studio	IT'S a rite of passage for many expectant parents: baby's first ultrasound. The fuzzy images of the fetus, produced during an examination in an obstetrician's office, are prized by couples, passed around proudly among friends and relatives. Now, trying to capitalize on this phenomenon, a number of companies are selling elective ultrasounds that have little to do with neonatal health. The services, often in small offices or shopping malls, amount to fetal photo studios and use newer 3-D ultrasound technology to produce more realistic images than conventional machines.
2004-09-11	ENRON TO SELL NATURAL GAS PIPELINES TO JOINT VENTURE	The Enron Corporation, which owes creditors more than $74 billion, won court approval for a $2.45 billion sale of its natural gas pipelines in the United States to a joint venture of the Southern Union Company and the General Electric Company. Judge Arthur Gonzalez of United States Bankruptcy Court approved the sale in a hearing yesterday in New York. The venture, CCE Holdings, was the highest bidder in last week's auction of the pipeline unit, Enron's largest remaining asset. The deal is part of the company's plan to exit bankruptcy by raising about $12 billion, mainly from asset sales. Enron, based in Houston, has two major businesses -- Portland General electricity utility and power plants and pipelines outside of North America. Once all the units are sold, Enron will cease to exist.
2004-09-08	G.E. to Put Insurance Units Under One Name	General Electric said yesterday that it would unify more than a dozen reinsurance and commercial insurance businesses under the brand name GE Insurance Solutions. The name replaces existing brands like Employers Re, GE Re, GE Frankona Re and Westport Insurance that General Electric had grouped under the Employers Reinsurance Corporation, which is based in Kansas City, Mo.
2004-09-03	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Power Plant Panel	The government set up a panel to look into the Dabhol power plant, a $2.9 billion operation -- idle for three years -- that is capable of producing 2,184 megawatts of power. Once showcased as an example of India's economic liberalization, the plant fell idle after a dispute over payments for power by a utility in the state of Maharashtra, which is part owner of the plant. The government is eager to restart the project, which was built by the Enron Corporation. But Dabhol is mired in disputes over debt and arbitration proceedings involving its shareholders, including General Electric and the Bechtel Group, which own 86 percent of the project after buying Enron's stake earlier this year. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2004-08-24	World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Airline's Bankruptcy Plan Approved	Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, won court clearance yesterday to leave bankruptcy on Sept. 30 with a plan that will give bondholders most of the equity and reduce labor costs by 1.1 billion Canadian dollars ($847.4 million) a year. Judge James Farley of Ontario Superior Court, who has overseen the case since Air Canada sought bankruptcy protection on April 1, 2003, approved the plan at a hearing in Toronto. The airline will have 2.87 billion Canadian dollars of long-term debt when it emerges, down from 4.3 billion dollars. Under the plan, creditors, including a General Electric unit and Deutsche Bank, will have most of the equity.
2004-08-20	G.E. GETS APPROVAL FROM GERMANY TO BUY INVISION	The General Electric Company received approval from Germany's competition agency, the Federal Cartel Office, for its $900 million acquisition of InVision Technologies Inc. on the condition that G.E. sells InVision's nondestructive testing unit. The agency said it included the condition because otherwise General Electric and InVision, the No.1 supplier of bomb detection machines at airports in the United States, would have a dominant position in this market. The two companies have agreed to sell the same InVision business to receive approval from the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the German competition authority said. General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., agreed to buy InVision in March to increase its security-equipment business.
2004-08-12	GENERAL ELECTRIC WILL ACQUIRE BANK IN MOSCOW	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy DeltaBank, an issuer of Visa credit cards and personal loans that is based in Moscow. Terms were not disclosed. The purchase is General Electric's biggest investment in Russia to date, the companies said. General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., is expanding its consumer finance activities under the GE Money brand in Europe and Asia. DeltaBank -- which is owned by funds managed by Delta Capital Management -- has 5 branches and about 70 outlets at retailers like Ikea, said Dan O'Connor, the president of GE Consumer Finance in Europe. It hopes to expand to at least 50 branches, he said.
2004-07-31	InVision Inquiry Could Threaten G.E. Deal	InVision Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by General Electric, could face two federal investigations after an internal inquiry showed possible improper payments by distributors tied to sales outside the United States, the company said yesterday. Either company can call off the $900 million purchase if it is not completed by Oct. 31, InVision said in a statement.
2004-07-25	Corrections	An article last Sunday about the expansion of General Electric's health care business gave an outdated name for a competitor in the area of hospital computer systems. It is the McKesson Corporation, which changed its name from McKesson HBOC in 2001.
2004-07-18	The Conglomerate Will See You Now; Is What's Good for G.E. Good for Health Care?	IMAGINE a small town where one person not only owns the hardware store, but is also the banker and the doctor's most trusted adviser. In a sense, General Electric is trying to play such a role in the nation's $2 trillion health care industry. New York-Presbyterian Hospital, one of the country's largest academic medical centers, is among the hospitals making a bet on G.E.'s move toward one-stop shopping. Last fall, it announced a seven-year, $500 million agreement for that calls for General Electric to offer advice -- and discounts -- on technology, as well as ways to increase efficiency. G.E. is also offering options for financing.
2004-07-17	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the effect of airline industry troubles on the General Electric Company attributed a comment erroneously to Henry A. Hubschman, president of GE Commercial Aviation Services. While he did refer to the last few years as ''the perfect storm,'' it was the writer of the article who said, ''It may not be over.''
2004-07-16	Nothing but Friendly Skies for G.E.; Giant in Engines and Plane Leasing Finds Itself in Win-Win Situations	It would seem that any company that lends to, sells to or rents to a United States airline would be running scared these days, what with sky-high fuel prices, continued terrorism alerts and potential bankruptcies beleaguering the customer base. And a company that does all three -- well, its executives ought to be chewing their fingernails past the cuticle lines.
2004-07-10	De Beers Agrees to Guilty Plea To Re-enter the U.S. Market	De Beers, the world's largest diamond producer, has agreed to plead guilty to criminal price fixing, a court official and a lawyer involved in the case said on Friday. The move ends a decade-long case and paves the way for the company to return to the United States after an absence of nearly half a century. The company is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday before Judge George C. Smith of Federal District Court in Columbus, Ohio, said Keith Mayton, a clerk in that court. He said the company faced a maximum fine of $10 million.
2004-07-10	G.E. Earnings Increase 3.4%; Sales Up the Most Since 2000	General Electric reported yesterday that second-quarter profit rose 3.4 percent as acquisitions and demand for plastics, engine parts and loans fueled the biggest sales gain in almost four years. Net income rose to $3.92 billion from $3.79 billion in the period a year earlier, the chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said. Per-share profit was unchanged at 38 cents, 1 cent above his forecast, because of 342 million shares issued to finance its purchase of Amersham.
2004-07-08	Once a Corporate Hunter, Enron Is Now Just Leftovers	Enron may still be called Enron, but the company that was once at the pinnacle of the international energy industry is now little more than a shadow of its former self. ''The company is a smoking ruin, nothing more,'' said John Olson, chief investment officer at Sanders Morris Harris, a Houston investment bank. ''What's left now is for a few people to swoop down and pick at Enron's carcass -- at least, the good parts.''
2004-06-20	What Lurks Inside Your Index Fund	THE extraordinarily long and wonderfully lucrative decline in interest rates is over. Are you ready for the coming seismic shift? Tumbling rates have kindled booms in stocks, bonds and real estate in recent years. They have also propelled shares of financial services companies, whose profits exploded as their capital costs sank. While rising rates will probably stop all of these booms, financial services stocks are particularly imperiled. And whether they know it or not, owners of equity index funds that mirror the Standard & Poor's 500 will be pained by the decline in these shares.

Around the same time, two more bombs went off, one south of the capital, one north, claiming eight more lives. A1 Officials with human rights and aid groups say that if the United States government does not bring charges against Saddam Hussein relatively soon it will be technically required, because of his prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Conventions, to release him after the restoration of limited sovereignty.

2004-05-28	G.E. Attacks European Ruling on Honeywell Merger	Lawyers representing General Electric made a stinging attack on the European Commission on Thursday during an appeal of the commission's veto of General Electric's $43 billion acquisition of the avionics company Honeywell in 2001. That deal will not be revived even if General Electric's legal team persuades the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg to annul the three-year-old order. G.E. and Honeywell are appealing the ruling in order to clarify European law on mergers.
2004-05-25	G.E. Sells Unit's Shares Below Target Price	The General Electric Company has sold $2.83 billion of shares in its insurance unit, 7.1 percent below its minimum target price. General Electric sold 145 million shares in the initial public offering of Genworth Financial Inc. at $19.50 each. That was lower than a price range of $21 to $23 a share indicated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday.
2004-05-13	Companies Band Together as a Way to Offer Health Care to Part-Time Employees	Some of the nation's largest employers, including General Electric, I.B.M., McDonald's and Sears, Roebuck, plan to pool their buying power to try extending health coverage to part-time employees and other workers without insurance. But some analysts say that even if the companies succeed, they will make only a small dent in the enormous number of the nation's uninsured -- more than 43 million and growing.
2004-05-06	US Airways Debt Downgraded, Stirring Doubt on Jet Financing	The credit rating of the US Airways Group was downgraded one level by Standard & Poor's yesterday, casting doubt on the airline's financing from the General Electric Company for new smaller jets that would reduce costs. The downgrading came on the day that Edward G. Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania, said that US Airways told him it might stop using Pittsburgh as a base.
2004-04-24	Halliburton, in Iraq for the Long Haul, Recruits Employees Eager for Work	Is Iraq the right destination for a 48-year-old with eight grandchildren? Cynthia Johnson, the grandmother in question, laughed at the query as she tried on an airtight yellow jumpsuit that might protect her from a chemical weapons attack. Ms. Johnson and hundreds of others hired by the Halliburton Company packed into what used to be a J.C. Penney store at the Greenspoint Mall here this week to prepare to go to Iraq. She said her job there, serving food to American troops, was more promising than her previous occupation, cooking on an offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
2004-04-22	Violence in Iraq Curbs Work of 2 Big Contractors	The insurgency in Iraq has driven two major contractors, General Electric and Siemens, to suspend most of their operations there, raising new doubts about the American-led effort to rebuild the country as hostilities continue. Spokesmen for the contractors declined to discuss their operations in Iraq, citing security concerns, but the shutdowns were confirmed by officials at the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity, the Coalition Provisional Authority and other companies working directly with G.E. and Siemens in Iraq.
2004-04-14	Housatonic River Ranked Among Most Endangered	The Housatonic River, which flows through Connecticut to Long Island Sound from the Massachusetts border, is seventh on a national conservation group's list of the 10 most endangered rivers in the United States. The group, American Rivers, said the Housatonic was included on this year's list because critical decisions are expected to be made in the coming months about cleaning up toxic PCB's downriver from an old General Electric transformer factory in Pittsfield, Mass.
2004-04-13	Bechtel and G.E. Acquire Enron's Part of Indian Plant	The Bechtel Group and the General Electric Company, partners of the Enron Corporation in the Dabhol Power Company in India, have bought 65 percent of Dabhol to recoup part of the $1.2 billion they invested in the failed $3 billion venture. Bechtel and a financing unit of General Electric bought Enron's 65 percent stake in Dabhol for $22 million through a United States bankruptcy court in Manhattan, a Bechtel spokesman, Jeff Leichtman, said on Monday. The companies, the two main contractors for the plant, each had a 10 percent stake.
2004-04-10	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about General Electric's first-quarter earnings misstated the timing of its issue of shares to cover the cost of the merger of its NBC broadcasting unit with Vivendi Universal Entertainment. That occurred last month; no further offering is planned for that purpose next month.
2004-04-09	G.E.'s Earnings Edge Higher, Aided by Recent Acquisitions	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose, aided by a rebound in orders at some of its industrial units as well as recent acquisitions in businesses including health care and consumer finance. For the quarter, G.E. said it earned $3.24 billion, or 32 cents a share, up about 1 percent from the period a year ago, when the company reported net income of $3.21 billion, or 32 cents a share. Those results were before the effect of a required accounting change. Including that change, the prior year's earnings were just under $3 billion, or 30 cents a share.
2004-04-07	Boeing Awards Engine Contract to G.E. and Rolls-Royce	The Boeing Company announced yesterday that it had selected the General Electric Company and Rolls-Royce Group P.L.C. to supply engines for the new 7E7 aircraft. The two companies beat out Pratt & Whitney, part of the United Technologies Corporation, for a contract estimated to be worth as much as $40 billion over 25 years.
2004-03-31	7 Companies Band Together in Hopes of Building Nation's First New Nuclear Plant in Decades	In an effort to revive the nuclear reactor construction industry, seven major companies plan to announce on Wednesday that they will apply for a license to build a new commercial power plant. The last time a plant was ordered but not later canceled was 1973. The companies, including the two largest nuclear plant owners in the United States and two reactor manufacturers, have not specified what they would build or where. In fact, they have not made a committment to build at all. But they have agreed to spend tens of millions of dollars to get permission to build, and they anticipate tens of millions from the federal government, which requested such proposals in November. The money would go to finish design work useful for a new generation of reactors and to develop a firm estimate of what such plants would cost.
2004-03-25	JUDGE CLEARS WAY FOR VIVENDI AND DILLER TO GO TO TRIAL	The lawsuit filed by Vivendi Universal to force Barry Diller to get out of the way of a planned deal with the General Electric Company's NBC unit will go to trial in a Delaware Court in May, after a ruling yesterday from the judge overseeing the case. The request on expedition made by Vivendi, which is based in Paris, said the suit must be resolved before Vivendi's United States unit can combine with NBC. ''I'm satisfied there's a need for expedition,'' Vice Chancellor Stephen Lamb said at the conclusion of a hearing on the question of how fast the Delaware Chancery Court should move on the case. The judge set a trial date of May 7, if the matter is to be tried in a single day. If the trial is to take two days, it will be May 6 and 7.
2004-03-18	INVISION IS SUBJECT OF S.E.C. TRADING INVESTIGATION	The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating suspected insider trading this month in options on the stock of InVision Technologies in the days before the General Electric Company announced it would buy the company. The Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted an S.E.C. request for a temporary restraining order freezing $2 million of assets of ''unknown purchasers'' of call options on shares of InVision, the S.E.C. said in a statement. General Electric announced on Monday that it had agreed to buy InVision, a maker of explosives detectors for airports, for $900 million.
2004-03-14	Corporate America Sending More Legal Work to Bombay	When Laurene Horiszny, the general counsel of BorgWarner, needed to research an employment law question in several states, she left her firm's lawyers alone. She did not contact the outside firms she retains either. Instead, Ms. Horiszny turned to Mindcrest, a fledgling consulting firm with Indian-trained lawyers in Bombay ready to do the work. The research, Ms. Horiszny said, was ''much less expensive than going to our outside firms.'' And she was satisfied enough with the results to engage Mindcrest for a second project, an initial legal review of the purchase order terms used by BorgWarner, an automotive parts manufacturer.
2004-03-13	World Business Briefing | Europe: Appeal In G.E.-Honeywell Rejection	Appeals against the European Commission's rejection of General Electric's acquisition of Honeywell in 2001 are expected to be heard in late May, said Louise Binns, a spokeswoman at G.E. The European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg has proposed that Honeywell's appeal be heard on May 25 and G.E.'s appeal will be heard two days later. The commission blocked the deal, valued at $45 billion at the time, because it believed it would harm competition in the market for aircraft parts. G.E. and Honeywell abandoned the deal, but G.E. is pursuing the appeal to overturn the commission's ruling in case it pursues another merger. Paul Meller (NYT)
2004-03-13	G.E. Signals a Growing Interest in Solar	General Electric will acquire the major assets of the largest American-owned maker of solar equipment, in a move the solar power industry sees as a major vote of confidence in the business. A federal bankruptcy court judge in Delaware yesterday approved G.E.'s plan to buy the bulk of AstroPower for $15 million in cash and an estimated $3.5 million in debt, along with other liabilities to be settled when the deal closes at the end of the month. It would be the most decisive step yet by G.E. into the so-far unprofitable business of generating electricity from sunlight, a technology that G.E. researchers have dabbled in for nearly half a century.
2004-02-22	Business; Running a Hospital Like a Factory, in a Good Way	ON the face of it, SSM St. Joseph Health Center, a small hospital in suburban St. Louis, does not seem very revolutionary in business terms. The hospital is a nonprofit institution run by the Franciscan Sisters of Mary. The chief executive, Alan Kevin Kast, is a former seminarian who begins his meetings with prayer and refers to his hospital as a ministry. A crucifix hangs in every room. Yet St. Joseph is also guided by worldly objectives. The 364-bed hospital, part of SSM Health Care, which has 20 hospitals in four states and is led by Sister Mary Jean Ryan, is in the vanguard of health care change. By using the quality and productivity techniques that helped strengthen American industry in the 1980's, the hospital has improved patient care and reduced medication errors, waiting time in the emergency room and infection rates. It has even sharply reduced nursing turnover, which prevents many hospitals from delivering consistent care.
2004-02-15	Business; Companies Hope Profits Run From Clean Water	MILLIONS have been made by turning water into a designer product and putting it in attractive bottles aimed at the hip and health-conscious. But those who see money when they look at water are now far more intrigued by two areas of the business that are less sexy, but potentially far more lucrative: providing clean water for industrial and municipal use, and cleaning dirty water when that use is done. Small wonder. According to Kerry Stirton, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, industrial water treatment alone is a $35 billion global market. When municipal treatment systems and other water processes are factored in, he said, water-related revenue may even top $100 billion.
2004-02-04	Welch Makes Another Major Book Deal	Armed with a proposal that ran just two and a half pages, John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman of General Electric, sold the world rights yesterday for a how-to business manual to HarperCollins, a unit of the News Corporation, for an estimated $4 million. The book, which will be called ''Winning,'' did not quite fetch the advance of ''Jack: Straight From the Gut,'' which he sold in 2000 without any written proposal for an extraordinary advance of $7.1 million. But the $4 million HarperCollins is said to be paying is still a hefty sum for a business book, or any book for that matter.
2004-01-22	G.E.'S PLAN TO TAKE OVER BRITISH COMPANY IS APPROVED	The European Commission has approved General Electric's planned takeover of Amersham, the British diagnostic pharmaceuticals and biosciences company. The commission said it saw no overlaps in business, and although they share clients such as hospitals, it did not expect G.E. to be able to cut out competitors by bundling each company's products. European hospitals will continue to have competition from a variety of suppliers, the commission said. Paul Meller (NYT)
2004-01-20	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Plant Sale Offered	Foreign stakeholders in the Enron Corporation's stalled $2.9 billion power project, Dabhol Power, have offered to sell their 85 percent for less than half their original investment. Enron, which owns a 65 percent stake, and the General Electric Company and the Bechtel Group, which own 10 percent each, have offered to sell their combined stake for $380 million. The 2,184-megawatt power project came to a standstill two years ago when the sole buyer of the power it generated, the utility of the western state of Maharashtra, defaulted on payments. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2004-01-17	G.E. Earnings Up 47%, Aided by Insurance Unit and More Industrial Orders	General Electric said yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings rose 47 percent, helped by insurance income and increases in orders at industrial businesses like plastics and jet engines. Net income rose to $4.56 billion, or 45 cents a share, from $3.1 billion, or 31 cents, in the period a year earlier, which included 14 cents a share in reinsurance expenses.
2004-01-08	Let There Be L.E.D.'s	IT started innocently enough. Marcel Jean Vos, an interior and commercial designer in London, bought some light-emitting diodes to create a small lighting system in the kitchen of his apartment. Now, four years later, Mr. Vos has transformed a neighboring one-bedroom apartment into a space lighted entirely with L.E.D.'s, the solid-state technology more commonly associated with the tiny lights on electronic gadgets. The apartment has 360 L.E.D. arrays, and about 20 yards of plastic ribbons embedded with the glowing semiconductors. The lighting effects include a kitchen counter that changes color, an illuminated shower stall, a candle that has chips instead of a wick, and a light sculpture.
2004-01-04	Careers Settle Within a Thriving Home	THE lights start coming on at the Derk house in Evansville, Ind., at 5:30 in the morning. Waking early is a habit left over from the years several of the children spent in an orphanage, where no one really ever got much sleep. They are all old enough now to put on their clothes, and while they do, their parents, Kimberly and Jim, are downstairs doing the daily scramble of making the breakfast, walking the dog, packing the lunch bags. By 7:30, everyone is headed to school or to work.
2003-12-15	In India, a High-Tech Outpost for U.S. Patents	In clusters of modern low-and high-rise office buildings set amid acres of lush greenery here, thousands of engineers are hard at work, writing software for the latest telephones, designing next-generation microprocessors and developing wireless broadband technology. The work of these engineers is generating significant amounts of intellectual property for American companies like Cisco Systems, General Electric, I.B.M., Intel, Motorola and Texas Instruments -- whose various Indian units have filed more than 1,000 patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Some applications, with patents already granted, date to the early 1990's. But most applications from India have been filed in the last two years and still await decisions by the patent examiners in Washington.
2003-12-08	MediaTalk; Talking to the Boss, And Writing About It	Readers of Money magazine may have had a flash of repetition if they opened the business section of USA Today last week. On Dec. 1, the newspaper published an interview by Ron Insana, the CNBC anchorman, of Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. Since G.E. owns NBC, which operates the CNBC network, Mr. Immelt is Mr. Insana's ultimate boss.
2003-11-21	Corrections	A report by Bloomberg News in the Company News column of Business Day on Wednesday about the European Commission's antitrust review of General Electric's proposed purchase of the ultrasonic testing unit of Agfa-Gevaert misstated the expected date of a ruling. It is Dec. 5, not Dec. 4.
2003-11-19	G.E., Seeking to Spur Growth, Will Sell Many Insurance Assets	General Electric, struggling to climb back to double-digit earnings growth, announced a plan yesterday to spin off most of its life insurance and mortgage insurance business next year. G.E. said it would sell about 30 percent of the independent company, to be called Genworth Financial Inc., to the public in the first half of 2004 and offer additional portions later if the market is welcoming. The book value of the entire unit was about $10 billion on Sept. 30, the company said.
2003-11-19	REVIEW RESUMES ON GENERAL ELECTRIC BID FOR AGFA UNIT	European antitrust regulators restarted their review of the 400 million euro ($471 million) bid by General Electric for the ultrasonic testing unit of Agfa-Gevaert, after the company supplied missing information, the European Commission said. The commission, which will rule on the takeover by Dec. 4, suspended the review on July 9 to take account of the unusual circumstances brought on by the decision of seven European countries to hand the case to the Brussels regulators. The commission could clear the deal or open a four-month inquiry. The deal involves businesses that are too small to warrant an automatic review by the commission, which took the case in May at the request of Germany, Austria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy. General Electric agreed in January to buy the Agfa unit, which had sales of 220 million euros last year.
2003-11-13	G.E. TO ACQUIRE BOSTON LENDER FOR $72.4 MILLION	General Electric said yesterday that it would buy HPSC, a lender based in Boston, for $72.4 million, adding $1 billion in assets as it expands into financing equipment for doctors and dentists. General Electric, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., will pay $14.50 a share in stock, a 60 percent premium to HPSC's closing share price yesterday, the companies said. The transaction is expected to close late this year or early next. GE Healthcare Financial Services, which is based in Chicago and has $10 billion in assets, will add 130 HPSC employees in 13 states to its 700 employees. The unit is part of GE Commercial Finance, which has $200 billion in assets, and is one of the areas that General Electric's chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, has said he will expand as he moves into faster-growing industries.
2003-11-04	World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Bid For Property Company	The French real estate unit of the General Electric Company has bid 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) to buy the rival Sophia, challenging a bid from Société Foncière Lyonnaise. The G.E. unit is offering 41 euros a share, 5.3 percent more than Friday's closing price, the company said. Foncière Lyonnaise bid 38.50 euros a share in cash or five new shares for every four Sophia shares. Buying Sophia would help the G.E. unit expand its 3 billion euros of holdings in France and might help the company save money on taxes.
2003-10-25	COMPANY BRIEFS	GENERAL ELECTRIC, Fairfield, Conn., said it would sell about 5 percent of its reinsurance unit's life policies to Scottish Re Group, Hamilton, Bermuda, a global life reinsurance specialist, for $151 million. EQUITY INNS, Germantown, Tenn., an owner of hotels in 34 states, said it would buy four hotels in Florida from McKibbon Hotel Management, Gainesville, Ga., for $34.2 million.
2003-10-23	Gadget Knows Grandma Inside Out	BEBE FARIDA RAOUF lives alone in Manhattan and, like many elderly people, fears a sudden injury or illness. When she recognized the symptoms of a heart attack four years ago, she called for help, lay down on pillows on her floor and left the front door ajar for paramedics. Today Mrs. Raouf, 74, a former nursing assistant, is taking part in a test of a new home monitoring system that uses motion detectors to record her daily habits and, once a pattern is established, reports any unusual activities. Initially skeptical of the devices, Mrs. Raouf says the only change she has noticed is the occasional modem noise on her phone line when the system dials in to update her reports, she said.
2003-10-22	G.E. TO LAY OFF 1,000 WORKERS AT TURBINE FACTORIES	General Electric said it would cut 1,000 jobs at turbine factories in South Carolina and New York as deliveries of turbines for power plants decline. About 600 jobs will be cut in Greenville, S.C., and 400 more in Schenectady, N.Y., company executives said. GE Power Systems, the company's biggest industrial unit, has about 34,000 employees worldwide. The number of large turbines shipped from Greenville is forecast to drop to 120 this year from 241 last year, a spokesman, Mark Reilly, said.
2003-10-16	Universal Music to Cut 11% of Work Force	The Universal Music Group, the largest music company in the world and home to acts like U2, Eminem and Mariah Carey, is expected to announce a restructuring Thursday that will eliminate 11 percent of its work force. In the next several months, 800 jobs will be cut across all of Universal Music's divisions, according to company executives. Combined with the 550 jobs trimmed earlier this year, Universal Music's work force will shrink to 10,850 people. Executives said the cuts would eventually save the company $200 million a year.
2003-10-13	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Saturday about General Electric's third-quarter earnings misstated the year in which the company expects Amersham, the British company it is buying, to start adding to G.E.'s earnings. It is 2005, not 2004.
2003-10-11	G.E. Earnings Decline 11%; Key Product Lines Are Sluggish	General Electric, still hobbled by high costs and sluggish sales in formerly stellar industrial businesses like power systems, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings were 11 percent lower than those of last year, and that full-year earnings would be $1.55 to $1.57 a share, the lowest range of analysts' estimates. The announcement, however, came at the end of a week of big acquisitions that have laid out a blueprint for a G.E. that will be less dependent on old-line businesses, and far more tied to fast-growing ones like health care and communications.
2003-10-11	G.E. to Buy British Medical Company	General Electric announced yesterday that it would buy Amersham, a British medical company, for $9.5 billion in stock, expanding its presence in the health care industry, including the growing medical imaging business. GE Medical Systems, a division of G.E., is one of the largest suppliers of medical imaging devices that use technologies like magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, or PET. Amersham is a major supplier of the pharmaceutical agents injected into the body to improve pictures obtained during scans by the machines.
2014-01-02	G.E. Finishes Vivendi Deal, Expanding Its Media Assets	General Electric, owner of television's most profitable network, NBC, completed its agreement yesterday to acquire the entertainment assets of Vivendi Universal in a deal that executives said would create a new entertainment conglomerate better able to compete with media giants like Viacom, Time Warner, the Walt Disney Company and the News Corporation. The new entity, to be called NBC Universal, will be 80 percent owned by G.E., with Vivendi retaining the rest. Under the deal, which still awaits government approval, investors in the debt-laden Vivendi, which had conducted a widely publicized auction to divest itself of its movie, cable and television production holdings, will receive $3.8 billion in cash through the issuance of about 125 million shares in G.E. stock. G.E. would also assume $1.7 billion in debt. (Shares of G.E. closed down 52 cents, to $30.21; the American depository receipts of Vivendi were down 4 cents, to $19.17.)
2014-01-02	A Deal Done, What Now With Diller?	Now, what to do about Barry Diller? With the completion of a deal by the NBC unit of General Electric to acquire the entertainment assets of Vivendi Universal, negotiations are likely to heat up between Vivendi and Mr. Diller, who controls a minority stake in Vivendi entertainment.
2003-09-29	In Handling Innovation, Patience Is a Virtue	In one of its current television commercials, the Hewlett-Packard Company describes itself as a leader in the science of nanotechnology. It invites consumers to imagine the exciting products of the future, like light bulbs that never burn out and ''a cellphone so small an ant could use it.'' The advertising team probably did not run that one by R. Stanley Williams, who works in the nanotechnology trenches as director for quantum science research at Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, Calif. Not surprisingly, Mr. Williams chose not to elaborate on the telecommunications needs of insects when he spoke here this week at the Emerging Technologies Conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Instead, he preached patience. Yes, it is possible to build a hand-held device that can outperform all the earth's present computers, he said, but it may take 50 years to figure out how to make it.
2003-09-23	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Dabhol Claims	Bechtel and General Electric said they had filed arbitration claims of about $600 million each against the Indian government to recover investments in the Dabhol power plant. The companies hold 10 percent each in the $2.9 billion Dabhol Power. Enron holds 65 percent and the government-run power utility owns the rest. The plant ran into trouble in June 2001 and stopped generating power when a utility run by the government of Maharashtra, which was trying to buy the plant, defaulted. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2003-09-21	As Scandals Still Flare, Small Victories for Investors	NEVER mind the $140 million paid to Richard A. Grasso for his work as a casino greeter. Never mind the hypocrisy of the New York Stock Exchange directors giving Mr. Grasso his money and then booting him for taking it. The big shocker in the Grasso imbroglio may be that two years after Enron, almost a year and a half after WorldCom and long after corporate America told us that we were through with scandals and back on ethical ground, anyone who turns over a corporate rock can still find the earth crawling with maggots. Of course, corporate leaders want investors to think that the worst is over and that new corporate governance rules have ''wounded all heels.'' The rising stock market also helps lull investors.
2003-09-08	Media Grow, but They Can't Hide	NBC's preliminary agreement last week to acquire the entertainment businesses of Vivendi Universal is the latest episode in a merger boom in the media business over the last eight years that has delivered control of the film, television and music industries in the United States to a half-dozen conglomerates. But the NBC deal could also signal the final stages of that merger mania. All six broadcast networks are tied to their film and television production studios, completing the soup-to-nuts integration of the broadcast business. And five companies -- Viacom, AOL Time Warner, Walt Disney, News Corporation and General Electric, the parent of the planned NBC Universal venture -- have carved up almost the entire broadcast and cable audience.
2003-09-07	Looking Beyond Vivendi At G.E.	TWO years ago this week, Jeffrey R. Immelt became chairman and chief executive of General Electric. At the close of business on Sept. 10, 2001, Mr. Immelt's first day on the job, G.E.'s stock was at $39.95 a share. It would not trade for another week because the market was closed after the Sept. 11 attacks. The following months were difficult, and the stock fell to as low as $22.48 this year.
2003-09-05	For France, 'an American Defeat'	It was not a great week for corporate France in America. First came word that Vivendi Universal, which is shedding assets to lighten its debt, agreed to negotiate exclusively with NBC to sell its entertainment businesses in the United States. Three years ago, Jean-Marie Messier, then Vivendi's chairman, paid $30 billion for the businesses. Now his successor, Jean-René Fourtou, was prepared to accept a deal that would give Vivendi something less than half that amount, a part in cash and part in shares of General Electric, NBC's parent.
2003-09-04	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Vivendi Universal's agreement to enter exclusive negotiations with General Electric on a merger of their entertainment assets misidentified the parent of the Bravo cable channel. It is NBC, not Vivendi.
2003-09-04	Must-Own TV	When he was on NBC, David Letterman became a cultural icon by mocking his corporate bosses at General Electric. The subtext to his gags: What can a maker of light bulbs possibly know about running a television network? Plenty, it turned out. NBC has been the most successful major network in the past decade. Now the conglomerate that traces its lineage to Thomas Edison -- and that liked appearing ambivalent about the TV business -- is poised to go Hollywood in a big way. G.E. is finalizing the terms of a merger between NBC and the American media assets of the French company Vivendi Universal. The Universal film studio is the crown jewel.
2003-09-04	No Room Seen For Diller In G.E. Deal With Vivendi	In an entertainment business photo album spanning the last 30 years, Barry Diller would pop up in a remarkable number of memorable snapshots. He ran Paramount Studios in the 1970's, founded the Fox broadcast network in the 1980's and sold his USA Networks to Jean-Marie Messier at Vivendi Universal two years ago at the top of the market in exchange for a complicated bundle of shares and financial obligations. But now that the NBC division of General Electric has agreed to buy the Universal film and television businesses from Vivendi Universal, the merger partners are politely trying to move Mr. Diller out of their picture.
2003-09-03	Vivendi Agrees to Talks to Combine U.S. Assets With NBC	Vivendi Universal picked a merger partner today for its entertainment assets, agreeing to enter exclusive negotiations with General Electric to unite them with NBC. If completed, the deal would result in the creation of NBC Universal, which would be the nation's sixth-largest media company. It would include NBC's assets -- the broadcast network, local stations, the cable channels CNBC and MSNBC and the Spanish-language network Telemundo -- and Vivendi's movie and television studios; its cable networks like USA, Bravo, and Sci-Fi; and the Universal Studios theme parks.
2003-09-03	G.E. Bid for Instrumentarium Receives European Approval	The European Commission approved General Electric's planned $2.2 billion acquisition of the Finnish medical devices maker Instrumentarium today, on condition that G.E. sell one unit and promise not to shut out competitors in a European market the combined companies will dominate. The deal is the first involving G.E. to face in-depth scrutiny in Europe since the commission prohibited G.E.'s $42 billion bid for Honeywell International in 2001.
2003-09-03	Market Place; The chief executive decides that G.E. can stand the risks of Hollywood's ups and downs.	ON the surface, the merging of NBC with Vivendi Universal's entertainment assets would appear to be the last type of deal John F. Welch Jr. would have made for General Electric. After all, Mr. Welch spent 20 years turning G.E. into a company that could be relied on for consistent earnings growth and high returns on capital. And Hollywood's volatility, with its unpredictable mix of flops and hits, would seem to represent the antithesis of that goal.
2003-09-02	Market Place; Vivendi Seems Unusually Willing To Do a Deal With a Handshake	It is the never-ending auction. While the board of Vivendi Universal may finally pick a merger partner -- most likely General Electric's NBC -- for its entertainment assets today, it will hardly be a done deal.
2003-09-02	In NBC and Its Chief, Clues to Any Partnership	Robert C. Wright started his career as a buttoned-down executive in the classic General Electric style, progressing through stints in its plastics, appliance and finance divisions before taking over its NBC television network 17 years ago. But there he fell in love with the sheer fun of the entertainment business, executives close to him say. He gave his wife a pin of a peacock, not a light bulb, and he named his boat the Peacock, both after NBC's trademark. And Mr. Wright began gently bumping against his parent company's conservative financial constraints as he tried to pull off a series of acquisitions to expand his entertainment empire.
2003-09-01	Vivendi Said To Now Favor An NBC Deal	After months of haggling with more than half a dozen bidders, Vivendi Universal is near a preliminary agreement to merge its entertainment assets with General Electric's NBC division, executives close to the talks said yesterday. Vivendi has scheduled a special board meeting tomorrow in Paris, where it is based, to approve the outlines of a deal with NBC and begin exclusive negotiations with it on final details, the executives said.
2003-08-27	Vivendi to Deal With 2 Prospective Suitors	The bidding for the entertainment assets of Vivendi Universal narrowed to two contenders yesterday when the company's board, after meeting in Paris, declared that it would continue talks with General Electric's NBC division and an investor group led by a previous owner, Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family controlled the Universal entertainment empire. The winnowing, which was widely expected, means that Vivendi Universal is essentially left with a choice between the two competitors. NBC is offering a partnership in a combined NBC-Universal entertainment conglomerate, without giving Vivendi much in the way of cash. Mr. Bronfman's group, on the other hand, would buy a majority stake in Vivendi's entertainment assets, for which the company is said to be seeking about $14 billion.
2003-08-26	Liberty Media Won't Bid on Vivendi Assets	The Liberty Media Corporation said yesterday that it was withdrawing from the bidding for Vivendi Universal's entertainment assets. The company announced its decision on the eve of a meeting at which Vivendi Universal's board is planning to review possible offers. A person close to the negotiations said Vivendi Universal effectively told Liberty that its bid was not adequate and would have to be substantively higher to be considered, prompting Liberty to announce its withdrawal. A Liberty spokesman declined to comment.
2003-08-22	$8 Billion in Cash in Bronfman Bid	A group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. that is bidding for the entertainment assets of Vivendi Universal has made an offer that includes about $8 billion in cash, says a person close to the auction. Though there were no other details available on the bid, the amount of cash being proposed is higher than what NBC is said to be offering for the assets, which include USA Network, Sci-Fi Network, a film and television studio and a stake in a theme-park business.
2003-08-19	Vivendi Is Said to Get 2 Bids for U.S. Units	Even though Vivendi Universal itself was not taking the deadline seriously, two bidders submitted offers yesterday for the company's American entertainment assets, according to a person close to the process. The bids were turned in by an investor group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. that includes Cablevision Systems and by Liberty Media, said this person, who could not provide details of the offers. The companies declined to comment.
2003-08-06	G.E. Will Buy Transamerica Lending Unit From Aegon	In a move that will increase its presence slightly in commercial finance, General Electric said yesterday that it had agreed to buy most of the commercial lending business of the Transamerica Finance Corporation from Aegon, its Dutch parent, for about $1 billion in cash. GE Commercial Finance will also assume $3.8 billion in debt and take over some leasing receivables.
2003-08-05	GENERAL ELECTRIC TO SELL BOND INSURANCE UNIT	General Electric yesterday agreed to sell its bond insurance unit for $1.9 billion to a group led by the mortgage insurer PMI Group Inc. as part of a strategy to exit slower- growing businesses and raise cash to bolster its GE Capital unit. PMI, based near San Francisco, is buying the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company with the backing of the Blackstone Group, the Cypress Group and CIVC Partners, which includes the Bank of America Corporation as an investor. General Electric, the world's biggest company by market value, will keep $260 million of the unit's profit as part of the sale. G.E. is disposing of units that do not have leading positions in their markets and raising cash to protect the credit rating of its GE Capital unit.
2003-08-02	G.E. TO POST $150 MILLION GAIN ON EDISON SALE	The General Electric Company, which plans to sell some finance units for as much as $10 billion this year, said yesterday that it would post a $150 million gain on the sale of its Japanese life insurance unit to the American International Group. The gain was disclosed in General Electric's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company agreed on June 26 to sell GE Edison Life Insurance as well as its car and home units to A.I.G. for $2.15 billion in cash.
2003-07-17	G.E. Proposes A Way to Ease Finnish Deal	In a bid to secure European regulatory approval of its $2.3 billion acquisition of the Finnish medical devices maker Instrumentarium, the General Electric Company has offered to sell Spacelabs, a recently acquired unit of the Finnish company, people close to the review said today. ''We have submitted proposals to meet the European Commission's concerns,'' Louise Binns, a G.E. spokeswoman, said, declining to comment on details of the proposals.
2003-07-12	G.E. Says Yearly Profit Rise To Be Smallest in a Decade	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its annual profit would show its smallest increase in a decade because of slow economic growth and SARS. Profit will rise from $1.55 to $1.61 a share, General Electric said. The chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, previously said profit might be as high as $1.70 a share. He gave the new range after reporting that second-quarter earnings declined 14 percent.
2003-07-10	Report Faults Big Companies On Climate	Many of the world's largest companies are doing a poor job of preparing for the business impact of global warming, a report issued yesterday by investor, environmental and public interest groups said. Most of the 20 corporate giants discussed, including leaders in the oil, auto and utility industries, are also failing to disclose to investors enough about the financial risks they face from climate change, according to the report, which was prepared by the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.
2003-07-08	Europe Lists Its Objections To G.E. Deal	The European Commission has sent General Electric a formal statement outlining its concerns about the company's planned acquisition of the Finnish medical devices maker Instrumentarium. The companies said today that they remained confident the deal would go ahead. ''Both G.E. and Instrumentarium are continuing constructive dialogue with the European Commission and the acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2003,'' the companies said in a joint statement to the Finnish stock exchange today.
2003-06-29	Some Numbers Only Add To the Fog	JEFFREY R. IMMELT, chief executive of General Electric, has made it a priority that his company provide investors with financial statements of the highest quality and integrity. And indeed, because G.E.'s businesses remain bewilderingly complex, investors need all the help they can get. One of the reasons G.E.'s numbers can be difficult to parse is that it buys and sells so many businesses each year. When G.E. includes gains on asset sales in its overall operating results, instead of highlighting them on a separate line on the income statement, investors have to work harder to distinguish earnings that come from continuing operations from those that are nonrecurring. The problem is that gains from asset sales are not as desirable as earnings from continuing operations. Once a business is disposed of, it no longer generates earnings. Proceeds from its sale should not merit the same price-earnings multiple as earnings from continuing operations do.
2003-06-28	NBC Is Said To Be Pressing Vivendi Offer	Intent on surviving the first cut in the bidding for Vivendi Universal's entertainment assets, NBC is seeking to reaffirm the seriousness of its proposal for a joint venture, according to senior executives close to NBC's strategy. The executives said that the company had made it clear in discussions with Vivendi that it was enthusiastic about its bid -- which would combine its television assets with Vivendi's cable and TV production businesses -- and intended to be aggressive in pursuing it to a conclusion.
2003-06-27	A.I.G. TO BUY THREE GENERAL ELECTRIC INSURANCE UNITS	The American International Group, one of the world's largest insurers, said yesterday that it was buying the Japanese life insurance business of General Electric, as well as G.E.'s small auto and home insurance business in the United States, for $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, depending on how long the deal takes to close. A.I.G. will become the sixth-largest life insurer in Japan, with annual premium revenue of about $9 billion. Joseph B. Treaster (NYT)
2003-06-26	A.I.G. to Buy General Electric's Life Insurance Unit in Japan	The American International Group, one of the world's largest insurers, is expanding its already robust operations in Japan by buying the Japanese life insurance business of General Electric, people who have been briefed on the transaction said yesterday. A.I.G. plans to pay about $2.6 billion for the life insurance company and for G.E.'s small auto and home insurance business in the United States.
2003-06-25	NBC Said to Seek Alliance With Vivendi Units, Not a Purchase	NBC is intent on joining the bidding for the nonmusic entertainment assets of Vivendi Universal, but wants to form an alliance with Vivendi rather than buy it out, according to several people briefed on NBC's plans. NBC, which would need the approval of its corporate parent, General Electric, before making a formal offer, wants to combine its broadcast and cable television operations with Vivendi Universal's entertainment assets in an arrangement that would give it majority control, according to several people close to NBC's planning.
2003-06-24	Market Place; NBC shows interest in some of Vivendi's entertainment assets.	FOUR companies submitted bids for Vivendi Universal's entertainment assets yesterday, but the most intriguing development, in the view of several people close to Vivendi, may have been the mere statement of interest by a fifth -- the NBC unit of General Electric. Although the size of the bids could not be determined, a person close to Vivendi said that Liberty Media, led by John C. Malone, had made a bid. So did two investor groups, one led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., the former chief executive of Seagram, and the other by the entrepreneur Marvin Davis.
2003-06-07	NBC's Olympic Run Is Extended to 2012 With $2 Billion Bid	NBC Sports held on to its Olympic franchise today by winning a three-way auction for the United States media rights to the 2010 and 2012 Olympic Games with a record bid of $2 billion. It was augmented by a nearly $200 million deal for General Electric, NBC's parent, to become a worldwide Olympic sponsor. The bid was made even though the sites for those Games have not yet been determined. NBC outbid offers made by the News Corporation's Fox network and by ABC and ESPN, which are owned by the Walt Disney Company, at the International Olympic Committee headquarters here.
2003-06-05	Washer Warns Dryer, 'Careful: It's Delicate'	Of all the consumer fantasies that arose during the Internet boom, one of the most improbable was the notion that the home would soon be transformed into a digital machine for living. Enthusiasts dreamed of refrigerators that communed wirelessly with the cereal box and the milk carton or of video picture frames that displayed ever-changing photos. Now another element of that vision seems to have materialized. General Electric says its new Profile Harmony clothes care system is the first washer-dryer combination in which the washer talks to the dryer electronically. Once you set the wash cycle, there is no need to program the dryer. The washing machine digitally communicates the type of fabric and duration of the cycle and selects the appropriate dryer settings. A stain inspector feature can choose a wash cycle based on the type of stain, the fabric and the color of the clothing.
2003-05-28	EUROPEAN PANEL TO MAKE ANTITRUST RULING ON G.E. DEAL	The European Commission will take charge of the antitrust assessment of General Electric's acquisition of a unit of Agfa-Gevaert at the request of seven European countries. Germany, Austria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy asked the commission to rule on the 400 million euro deal ($475 million). It involves businesses that are too small to set off an automatic review. General Electric agreed in January to buy the Agfa unit, which makes ultrasonic systems to test materials. The commission suspended the normal four-week ruling deadline so it can get information from G.E., a spokesman said.
2003-05-24	JUDGE APPROVES UNITED'S DEAL WITH G.E. ON 51 PLANES	United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, and General Electric gained a bankruptcy court judge's approval for their agreement on restructuring leases and financing arrangements on 51 planes. The agreement is expected to save United $200 million over five years and is part of the airline's goal to reduce aircraft costs by $500 million annually. Judge Eugene Wedoff of United States Bankruptcy Court approved the agreement yesterday in Chicago. The airline, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December, has been seeking to tailor its fleet size to a lower level of air travel demand. United, which is based in Chicago, would also get $16 million more in bankruptcy financing through the arrangement with the G.E. Commercial Finance unit.
2003-05-21	MIRANT TO SELL MOST OF STAKE IN POWER PLANT TO G.E.	The Mirant Corporation has agreed to sell almost all of its 50 percent stake in a Virginia power plant to a General Electric unit, GE Structured Finance, for about $71 million. The plant, near Fredricksburg, Va., can generate 242 megawatts, enough power for 193,600 homes. Mirant will have a book gain of $41 million on the sale, the company said yesterday. The transaction is scheduled to close this year pending lender consent and other approvals. Mirant, based in Atlanta, is keeping a 0.5 percent interest in the power generator. GE International, through GE Power Systems, will assume the operation and maintenance agreement associated with the plant, Mirant said. Cogentrix Energy Inc., based in Charlotte, N.C., owns 50 percent of the generator.
2003-05-20	G.E. Union Warns of Strike Over Health Care Increases	General Electric's largest union, which staged a two-day walkout over health benefits in January, threatened to go on strike again next month as it began negotiations yesterday for a new contract covering 14,000 workers. With General Electric pushing to increase employee contributions toward health coverage, union leaders said they might call a strike if G.E., one of the world's most profitable companies, pressed too hard on the issue.
2003-05-14	Deal Expected by Summer for ABB Oil Unit	ABB Ltd., the troubled Swiss builder of industrial and automation equipment, is expected to announce by the end of June the sale of its lucrative oil, gas and petrochemical business, valued at $1.5 billion. The Cooper Cameron Corporation, a United States maker of oil equipment, is the lead bidder for the most lucrative part of the division, people close to the company said. General Electric, Bechtel and Halliburton are also said to be interested in ABB's assets.
2003-05-13	Europe Extends Deadline on G.E.'s Finnish Deal	The European Commission has stopped the clock in its investigation into the planned acquisition by General Electric of a Finnish medical equipment company, Instrumentarium, pushing back the Aug. 18 deadline for a ruling on the deal. The commission said in a statement today that it had requested further information from both companies. ''As soon as the outstanding information is received, the commission will set a new deadline,'' the statement said.
2003-04-25	G.E. WILL ACQUIRE CROMPTON'S SILICONE UNIT	General Electric said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the silicone unit of the Crompton Corporation for as much as $1.05 billion. Crompton will get $645 million in cash and a G.E. specialty-chemicals business that makes compounds to curb oxidation and strengthen plastic. The companies valued the business at $160 million. Crompton will also receive payments of $105 million to $250 million over three years. The unit that G.E. is buying, OSi Specialties, makes silicone for adhesives and sealants used in products from lipstick to electronics. Crompton, based in Middlebury, Conn., said it would use proceeds from the sale to pay down long-term debt and contribute to its pension plans.
2003-04-24	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on April 12 about first-quarter financial results for General Electric referred incorrectly to profit at GE Capital, the company's financing division. It had net income of $1.67 billion; $826 million was the figure for GE Capital's commercial financing unit.
2003-04-23	Creditors Intensify Their Fight On Enron-Built Plant in India	At $2.9 billion, the Dabhol power project on India's west coast was the biggest foreign investment in the country's history and was planned to be the largest gas-fired power plant in the world. Since the collapse of the Enron Corporation, which built it, Dabhol has become one of India's deepest financial quagmires. The foreign lenders to the project, frustrated for nearly two years in their efforts to obtain repayment, started an international arbitration proceeding in London last week -- a step that seems certain to further embitter their tug of war with the project's Indian creditors.
2003-04-17	Fleet Suspends Stock Specialist	A specialist for the FleetBoston Financial Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange has been suspended for trading irregularities in shares of General Electric, according to a person briefed in the investigation. Specialists are responsible for ensuring orderly trading in stocks for which they have an exclusive franchise on the exchange. The trader was placed on administrative leave two days ago by Fleet specialists.
2003-04-12	G.E. Reports Profit That Matches Wall St. Predictions	The General Electric Company gave investors exactly what they expected yesterday, reporting a first-quarter profit that matched Wall Street's forecasts to the penny. Despite the weak economy, General Electric also reiterated its earnings forecast for all of 2003 yesterday, saying it expects to make $1.55 to $1.70 a share.
2003-04-09	SUPPORT URGED FOR COMPENSATION RULE AT G.E.	The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, urged General Electric shareholders to approve a resolution requiring the company to give performance-based stock options to executives. The fund, known as Calpers, solicited votes for performance-based options. Stock options currently granted by G.E. provide windfalls to executives in good economic times and penalize them in bad times, Calpers said.
2003-04-04	World Business Briefing | Europe: Medical Acquisition Inquiry	The European Commission said it had opened an investigation into the planned acquisition by General Electric of the Finnish medical equipment maker Instrumentarium. The commission said the combined entity would have high market shares in the markets for patient monitors, mobile X-ray machines and mammography equipment bought by hospitals. It also suspects that the deal may allow the company to squeeze out suppliers of machines that work alongside patient monitoring equipment, like anesthesia machines, the commission said. Paul Meller (NYT)
2003-04-02	National Briefing | Washington: Superfund Law Is Upheld	A federal district judge in Washington dismissed the General Electric Company's broad constitutional challenge to the Superfund law, which requires that sites contaminated by toxic wastes to be cleaned up by the parties that are responsible. G.E., which has 75 Superfund sites nationwide, had argued that the law violated due process because the Environmental Protection Agency does not conduct hearings before it issues an administrative order. The judge, John D. Bates, dismissed G.E.'s challenge for lack of jurisdiction. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)
2003-03-28	Corrections	A map in Science Times on Tuesday with an article about the effect of PCB contamination on fish in the Hudson River misidentified the company whose plant was a source of the pollution. It was G.E., not G.M.
2003-03-15	FEDERAL JUDGE APPROVES SALE OF CONSECO FINANCE	A federal judge approved the $1.37 billion sale of the Conseco Finance Corporation to a General Electric Company unit and CFN Investments. The action paves the way for Conseco Inc. to emerge from bankruptcy. The purchase of the finance unit, made in 1998, saddled Conseco with $6 billion in debt. Judge Carol Doyle of United States District Court in Chicago approved the sale. A Conseco lawyer said the total value of the deal was $1.37 billion.
2003-03-12	G.E. CHIEF RECEIVES A 10% RAISE, TO $6.9 MILLION	General Electric increased the salary and bonus of Jeffrey R. Immelt by 10 percent, to $6.9 million, in his first full year as chief executive officer, according to General Electric's proxy filing. Mr. Immelt received options to buy stock valued at $8.48 million, the filing said. A spokesman, Gary Sheffer, said the company would pay Mr. Immelt $6.69 million in stock later this month because it met some financial goals that were set before he became chief. In 2002, G.E. had the smallest gain in net income since 1993 as a weak economy hurt insurance and jet-engine sales. The stock fell 39 percent, its biggest drop in at least two decades. Mr. Immelt has set a goal of at least 10 percent annual growth and has promised to own stock valued at six times his salary.
2003-03-11	PCB Cleanup in Upper Hudson Is Delayed for Another Year	The dredging of the upper Hudson River to remove the toxic residue of its industrial past -- already stalled many times by squabbles over science and culpability -- has been delayed again. Federal environmental officials said yesterday that an additional year would be needed for planning and design beyond the three years already allotted. That means that the first scoop of polluted mud would not be removed until spring 2006 at the earliest and that the projected completion date would be six years later.
2013-12-23	G.E. Unit Gets China Contracts	The General Electric Company said today that its GE Power Systems unit received contracts to provide gas turbine systems to five Chinese power producers. G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., said another contract would be signed soon, bringing the total value to about $900 million for 13 of the systems.
2003-02-18	G.E. Said to Explore Sale of Motor Unit	General Electric is seeking to sell its motor manufacturing business for as much as $900 million, according to people briefed on the company's plans. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., has hired Lehman Brothers to help it find buyers, these people said.
2003-02-18	Pension Management Deal	Hermes Pensions Management, which manages pension funds for the BT Group, agreed to buy the General Electric Company's 50 percent stake in MEPC Ltd., a property investment company. Terms were not disclosed. Hermes and GE Real Estate took MEPC private in 2000 and each owned 50 percent of the company, MEPC said in a statement.
2003-02-17	Compressed Data; A Birthday Gives G.E. a Chance to Promote Itself	Few surveys are unbiased. Last week, General Electric celebrated the 156th birthday of its founding father, Thomas A. Edison, by publishing the results of a recent survey asking members of the public which of Edison's inventions was his greatest. Edison once said that his personal favorite was the phonograph. But that innovation -- among the eight choices G.E. offered in the survey -- was the top pick of only 5 percent of the 1,025 responses gathered by Opinion Research, the independent polling company retained by G.E. The top vote-getter was the light bulb, selected by 73 percent of those surveyed.
2003-02-05	G.E. Buying British Consumer Loan Operation	Abbey National, a big British bank, said today that it had agreed to sell most of its consumer lending division to General Electric of the United States for $1.4 billion in cash, to focus on providing consumers with checking and saving accounts, credit cards and mortgages. The division, known as First National, makes subprime mortgage loans and home improvement loans and finances large consumer purchases. First National also makes car loans and sells liability insurance, but those operations were not part of the sale. Abbey National said it was considering its options for those businesses.
2003-01-21	World Business Briefing | Europe: Belgium: Agfa Sells A Unit To G.E.	The aircraft engine division of General Electric has agreed to buy a division of the Belgian film and X-ray equipment maker Agfa-Gevaert for 400 million euros ($426.8 million), the companies said. The acquisition will allow G.E. to carry out nondestructive X-ray testing on a wider range of products than just aircraft engines, a G.E. spokesman, Rick Kennedy, said. The Agfa unit made sales worth 220 million euros last year from clients in the power generation and automotive sectors as well as from aerospace companies. Paul Meller (NYT)
2003-01-19	Private Sector; Stirring Words, Realist Tactics	IT was 19 degrees and the wind was whipping off Lake Erie as Ed Fire climbed onto the back of a pickup last Tuesday to address 150 workers who were on strike against General Electric. ''The greed of General Electric must stop,'' thundered Mr. Fire, president of G.E.'s largest union, as he denounced the company for increasing employee health care co-payments this month.
2003-01-16	O.K., Chief, It's Time to Get Down to Business	They are not just fire chiefs -- they are public sector executives. They must not only lead their firefighters into harm's way then safely back out again. They must also ''operationalize the values of their organization'' while they are at it. As if that were not enough, these salt-and-pepper-headed fire chiefs, who among them have several centuries' worth of experience in saving lives, must also learn their way around a balance sheet, understand team dynamics and master strategic planning.
2003-01-16	G.E. to Spend $100 Million Promoting Itself As Innovative	After almost a quarter-century, General Electric will no longer ''bring good things to life.'' It is taking the risky step of replacing the familiar corporate slogan with one meant to laud its innovations in areas far afield from prosaic products like refrigerators and night lights. On Sunday, the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, the General Electric agency since 1920, will introduce the theme ''Imagination at work.'' The campaign will present offbeat examples of imagination's aftermath, like what would have happened had a modern-day G.E. jet engine been strapped onto the airplane the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, N.C., in 1903.
2003-01-15	17,000 G.E. Workers Strike Over Higher Health Costs	Angry about General Electric's decision to force employees to pay more for their health coverage, 17,000 workers at 48 locations in 23 states began a two-day nationwide strike today. At the G.E. lighting division complex here, more than 150 strikers picketed in the 20-degree weather to show G.E., the nation's most profitable company, that they would not accept such increases in out-of-pocket costs without a fight.
2003-01-14	Executive Who Saved G.E. Is to Train School Principals	In the clearest signal yet that New York City's schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, and his boss, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, are pinning their hopes on corporate solutions to the school system's problems, Mr. Klein announced yesterday that John F. Welch Jr., the hard-bitten executive who turned around General Electric, will play a major role in a new training academy for school principals. Mr. Welch, who was known as Neutron Jack for his tough management style, will teach at the academy and head its advisory board.
2003-01-08	Union at G.E. Plans Strike On Health Fee	The largest union at General Electric announced yesterday that it would conduct a two-day strike next week to protest the company's decision to increase its employees' out-of-pocket health expenses. Union leaders said the walkout, scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday, would involve at least 14,000 workers and would affect many divisions, including appliances, jet engines, lighting and power systems. It would be the first national strike at G.E. since a 104-day walkout in 1969.
2003-01-05	Waiting for the President to Pass the Tax-Cut Gravy	PRESIDENT BUSH is expected to deliver a big tax-cut package to the nation on Tuesday, a New Year's present that he hopes will jump-start the economy. It is not yet clear what the package will include, but, thanks to a full-force lobbying effort, corporate America is sure to benefit. In the president's last tax cut, corporations were forced to accept much less than they had wanted so that individuals could get relief. Having agreed to sit out one gravy train, they now feel owed.
2002-12-31	G.E. Workers Set to Strike Over Insurance	The General Electric Company's union workers are planning their first national strike in more than 30 years as the company prepares to raise health care co-payments on Jan. 1. The unions will set a strike date once the company raises the medical costs, said Lauren Asplen, spokeswoman for the International Union of Electrical-Communications Workers of America. About 17,500 workers at General Electric are preparing for a walkout as the unions set picket assignments and prepare strike materials and headquarters, she said.

He hits a button and grins gleefully as the flat panel he holds generates a white glow bright enough to light the room. The panel is made from thin sheets of specially treated plastic on glass that seems to generate almost as much light from a small jolt of electricity as an incandescent light bulb running on standard current.
2002-12-25	India Is Regaining Contracts With U.S.	After slowing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, outsourcing by American companies to Indian concerns or to their own Indian units has begun to pick up. The new contracts span the technology-related spectrum, going well beyond the software code writing of the last decade to include chip design, product development, call centers, consulting and other support services. They give Indian companies the opportunity to expand their repertory with work that holds much promise for future growth. And they account for a significant chunk of business in India, especially here in Bangalore and the country's other high-technology cities.
2002-12-22	A Dubious Distinction for G.E.	When measured in terms of changes in total market value, General Electric stock was the worst performer in the world this year through Dec. 12, according to Morningstar Inc. G.E. stock lost $140 billion in market capitalization, equal to almost twice the gains of the top 10 performers combined.
2002-12-22	Private Sector; It's Big, Starts with G, Has Lots of Green	If anyone finds coal in his stocking this Christmas, John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, might be a good candidate. So says Jobs With Justice, a worker advocacy group, that named G.E. ''National Grinch of the Year 2002'' because of Mr. Welch's lavish retirement package. Each year Jobs With Justice makes the award to draw attention to those in powerful positions who, in its view, have done the most to hurt working families. In an Internet poll, G.E. won, with 37 percent of 1,700 votes cast. The company was cited for proposing increases in payments that G.E. workers and retirees must pay for their health plan, while giving Mr. Welch a multimillion-dollar retirement package that included payments for his apartment, V.I.P. tickets at Yankee Stadium, and even his laundry. ''While G.E. picks the pockets of working families and retirees, it is lavishing perks on current and retired executives,'' the group. ''The most notorious is former C.E.O. Jack Welch.''
2002-12-18	G.E. SAID TO BE NEAR DEAL FOR INSTRUMENTARIUM	General Electric is close to a deal to buy the Instrumentarium Corporation, a Finnish medical equipment maker, for about $2 billion in cash, executives close to the negotiations said last night. An announcement is expected today. G.E.'s board approved the deal yesterday, and Instrumentarium's directors are planning to vote on the transaction in Helsinki this morning. The transaction would bolster G.E.'s medical-systems business, especially in Europe, by adding Instrumentarium's set of medical technologies like its anesthesia delivery and monitoring systems. Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, hinted yesterday that he planned to expand the company's medical businesses through acquisitions as he reiterated the company's lowered earnings forecast for this year. A spokesman for G.E. declined to comment on the talks yesterday. A spokesman for Instrumentarium could not be reached. Andrew Ross Sorkin (NYT)

2002-11-26	GE MEDICAL TO BUY MILLBROOK, A SOFTWARE MAKER	The General Electric Company, a maker of medical-imaging equipment, agreed to buy the closely held Millbrook Corporation to expand its medical-information-management business into doctor's offices.

Millbrook is based in Carrollton, Tex. GE Medical Systems is based in Waukesha, Wis.
2002-11-22	G.E. Trims 2003 Profit Forecast, but Shares Climb 8.2%	General Electric cut its profit estimate for 2003 yesterday and said it would take a $2.1 billion pretax charge this quarter to increase reserves at its insurance division. But the company's stock rose 8.2 percent, as investors discounted the charge, which had been expected, and focused on General Electric's plans to raise its dividend and its optimistic projections for several divisions.
2002-11-21	Exxon-Led Group Is Giving A Climate Grant to Stanford	Four big international companies, including the oil giant Exxon Mobil, said yesterday that they would give Stanford University $225 million over 10 years for research on ways to meet growing energy needs without worsening global warming. Exxon Mobil, whose pledge of $100 million makes it the biggest of the four contributors, issued a statement saying new techniques for producing energy while reducing emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases were ''vital to meeting energy needs in the industrialized and developing world.''
2002-11-19	G.E. UNIT ACQUIRES INFOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS	GE Industrial Systems, a unit of General Electric, has acquired Infographic Systems of Garden Grove, Calif., a privately held provider of access control products and systems for electronic security and premises management. Financial terms were not disclosed. GE Industrial said that Infographic Systems' products included electronic access control, alarm monitoring, photo badging and video imaging. GE Industrial said the acquisition would continue its expansion in the $20 billion electronic security industry. Infographic Systems will become part of GE Interlogix, a unit of GE Industrial Systems.
2002-11-08	G.E. Says It Is Dropping 2 Directors From Board	The General Electric Company said today that two directors would step down as the company moved to strengthen corporate governance and make its board more independent. The company said the two directors, Scott McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, and Paolo Fresco, the chairman of Fiat, would leave at the end of the year. Mr. McNealy's company is a customer, supplier and financial partner of General Electric, while Mr. Fresco is a former vice chairman.
2002-11-06	EUROPE ALLOWS G.E. TO BUY UNIT OF ABB FOR $2.3 BILLION	The European Commission gave General Electric the clearance yesterday to buy the structured finance unit of ABB Ltd. for $2.3 billion. ABB will use the cash proceeds of the sale, scheduled to close on Nov. 29, to reduce its $4.1 billion debt. G.E. now appears to have overcome its problems with European regulators. G.E. said the purchase ''significantly broadens the products and services'' offered by its European structured-finance operations. The unit, which employs 500 people in 11 countries, provides loans and leasing opportunities to companies for large infrastructure projects like shipping and railways. The sale helps ABB, the Swiss industrial giant, stay on track to meeting its debt reduction target by the end of the year, its chief financial officer, Peter Voser, said in a statement.

Building at lunchtime yesterday, he could have had a main course with rice and pumpkin cookies for dessert with KATIE COURIC and CHRISTOPHER REEVE on the 64th floor. He could have heard about the public-television series ''Freedom: A History of Us,'' which they were promoting and for which NBC's parent, General Electric, was the sole corporate sponsor. He could have seen SUSAN SARANDON surprise Mr. Reeve with a $100,000 check for his foundation on spinal cord injuries. He could have said hello to a crowd that included JAMES KELLY, the managing editor of Time magazine.
2002-10-31	Judge Permits a Litigator to Join the Welch Divorce Team	A Connecticut judge agreed yesterday to allow Dan K. Webb, a well-known litigator, to join the legal team working on the divorce of John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric. The judge's decision came in a hearing in Superior Court in Bridgeport, Conn., attended by Mr. Welch and his wife, Jane Beasley Welch. After the hearing, Mr. Welch said that Mr. Webb, a partner in the Chicago law firm of Winston & Strawn, ''will help to get us settled. The last thing you want is to be in court.''
2002-10-29	Welch Wants New Lawyer Brought In In Divorce Suit	John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric, is trying to bring in Daniel K. Webb, a prominent trial lawyer and a former United States attorney in Chicago, to work on his pending divorce from Jane Beasley Welch. Mr. Webb, a partner at Winston & Strawn in Chicago, has represented Philip Morris in tobacco litigation and has recently been hired by Microsoft for a new round in the government's antitrust battle. Controversial cases are a natural for trial lawyers, he has said, because those are the ones where the parties do not settle but instead go to trial.
2002-10-24	G.E. TO BUILD LAB IN GERMANY FOR $52 MILLION	General Electric said yesterday that it would invest $52 million over the next five years to build its first European research laboratory in Garching, on the outskirts of Munich. The laboratory is expected to employ 150 scientists by 2005. G.E. said the lab would focus on technology development in areas like renewable energy, medical imaging and materials science rather than on fundamental research. G.E. opened its first overseas lab in 2000, in Bangalore, India, and is building another, in Shanghai. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)
2002-10-12	Investors Bid Up G.E. Shares As Earnings Post 25% Gain	General Electric, managing to offset profit declines in many units with several one-time gains, said yesterday that it earned $4.09 billion, or 41 cents a share, in the third quarter, and confirmed its expectations of earning $1.65 a share for the year. The earnings were almost 25 percent higher than the $3.28 billion, or 33 cents a share, that G.E. earned in the period a year earlier, and were in line with analysts expectations.
2002-09-28	Citing a Tight Bond Market, G.E. Makes a Loan to a Buyer	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had lent $235 million to the buyer of its electronic commerce unit because money was not available from the bond market. The buyout firm Francisco Partners was unlikely to raise enough money to finance the $800 million purchase of the unit, Global eXchange Services, given that ''the bond markets were not good in June when we announced the agreement, and they've gotten worse since then,'' said David Frail, a spokesman for G.E. The option to provide financing was in the original agreement, Mr. Frail said.

2002-09-21	Atonement in the Boardroom	Jack Welch's gut told him it was time to give up his lavish retirement perks, and investors can only hope that his decision is contagious. Mr. Welch insisted there was nothing improper about his retirement deal in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article last Monday, but nevertheless announced he would start paying General Electric an estimated $2 million a year for the use of the company jet, Manhattan apartment and other perks that were part of a 1996 agreement to keep him on the job for another few years. September is turning out to be a moment of reckoning for extravagant executive compensation packages. William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, recently attacked excessive C.E.O. pay as a moral failure. He noted that chief executives earn on average 400 times their average employee's income, up from 42 times in 1980.
2002-09-20	Divorce Judge Wants New Filing From Wife of Former G.E. Chief	A Connecticut state court judge said yesterday that an affidavit filed by Jane B. Welch in her pending divorce from John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, must be revised to meet state guidelines. The judge, Julia DiCocco Dewey, said that the filing would have to include Mrs. Welch's assets, liabilities, income and expenses and that it could not include opinion or characterizations of the couple's lifestyle. For example, the affidavit already filed describes the Welches' standard of living during their marriage as ''extraordinary.''
2002-09-20	G.E. and the Rest of Us	To the Editor: Re ''Tarnished Image Places Welch in Unlikely Company'' (Business Day, Sept. 16): Much is being made of the money and benefits being paid to John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric. But these issues are really for G.E. shareholders and the Internal Revenue Service to consider.
2002-09-17	G.E.'s Ex-Chief to Pay for Perks, But the Question Is: How Much?	John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, will pay for most of the corporate perks he negotiated to receive in retirement, including the use of a Boeing 737 business jet and an apartment overlooking Central Park, the company confirmed yesterday. The decision that Mr. Welch will pay for the benefits came as the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors and corporate governance experts raised questions about how much shareholders know about the true cost of perks to current and retired executives. G.E. said the S.E.C. requested information Friday night about Mr. Welch's benefits, both as chief executive and after he retired a year ago.
2002-09-17	G.E. Agrees to Purchase Leasing Unit of Deutsche	The General Electric Company announced today that it had agreed to buy the American leasing unit of Deutsche Bank for about $2.9 billion in cash and assumed debt, its second takeover of a European-owned financing business this month. The unit, Deutsche Financial Services, will become part of GE Commercial Finance, one of four divisions created by the breakup of GE Capital. Deutsche Financial Services, based in St. Louis, provides financing for office equipment, industrial machines and recreational vehicles for more than 1,000 manufacturers and about 14,000 companies. It has 1,200 workers and receivables of $2.7 billion.
2002-09-16	Tarnished Image Places Welch in Unlikely Company	At the Wharton School recently, a conference addressed ''once-soaring corporate captains'' who ''have crashed to earth.'' The examples included Kenneth L. Lay of Enron, Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom -- and John F. Welch Jr. Hardly company that Mr. Welch would want to keep. For years, the former chief executive of General Electric was viewed as the model of the perfect modern executive. In business schools throughout the world, his management style, swagger and acumen were analyzed and idolized.
2002-09-15	Courtside Tickets for Life	Other than the cost of a divorce lawyer, it is hard to imagine what Jack Welch has to pay for out of his own pocket. According to documents filed by his estranged wife, Jane B. Welch, as part of their divorce proceedings, Mr. Welch, the retired General Electric chief executive, even gets free flowers and toiletries in the $15 million apartment that G.E. maintains for him in Manhattan. The delicious little details in Mr. Welch's retirement package -- which Mr. Welch says his wife is exaggerating -- almost overshadow its considerable cost to G.E. shareholders. They are being asked to underwrite Mr. Welch's regal lifestyle even though they paid him handsomely while he was on the job and provide him with a generous pension. But nobody should be blinded to what it says about the current state of corporate governance in America. Like other deals struck in the age of the imperial chief executive, Mr. Welch's retirement package -- negotiated in 1996, five years before he stepped down as chief executive -- treats him like a sovereign entitled to all the fruits of the realm. In so doing, it blurs the line between corporate and personal resources.
2002-09-13	Ex-G.E. Chief Challenges His Wife's Report of Lavish Perks	Lawyers for John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, filed a court motion yesterday challenging his estranged wife's description of his living expenses but did not submit their own figures. Mr. Welch's wife, Jane B. Welch, is seeking more than the $35,000 a month that Mr. Welch has been providing her, arguing in divorce papers that she has been unable to maintain the standard of living that she had during their marriage.
2014-01-02	Good Charisma, Bad Business	Jack Welch is probably the ultimate manifestation of the charismatic chief executive, a figure that has become increasingly familiar in recent years. But charisma, whether in primitive societies or corporate boardrooms, is overrated, and its relation to success is uncertain. This is a useful lesson, especially considering the revelation of the many personal perks Mr. Welch continues to receive even into retirement: free tickets to baseball and basketball games, use of a corporate jet and a rent-free apartment on Central Park -- including all costs for food, laundry and even newspapers. Why did General Electric's board provide Mr. Welch, who retired last year as chief executive and whose net worth approaches $1 billion, with such lavish benefits? He can obviously afford to buy his own groceries.
2002-09-11	Many Chiefs Are Retaining Extra Benefits In Retirement	Often described as a model for chief executives, John F. Welch Jr. appears to have also created the model employment contract. The contract that Mr. Welch signed in 1996 as chief executive of General Electric was full of benefits that continue to flow to him in retirement. It quickly became a template for other executives to use to negotiate their own contracts, people in the field of executive pay say.
2002-09-09	G.E. Perks Raise Issues About Taxes	In the wake of documents that detail the long list of living expenses General Electric paid for John F. Welch Jr., its former chief, some corporate governance experts are asking why G.E. did not more fully disclose the information and who should pay the taxes on all these benefits. The benefits were detailed in divorce papers that Mr. Welch's estranged wife, Jane Beasley Welch, filed in Superior Court in Bridgeport, Conn., on Thursday. They include a list of corporate perks including lifetime use of a palatial Manhattan apartment complete with wine, flowers, cook, housekeeper and other amenities, as well as access to General Electric's Boeing 737 jets, helicopters and a car and driver for Mr. Welch and his wife. Also included were tickets for the couple at a number of top sporting events and the opera.
2002-09-06	G.E. Expenses For Ex-Chief Cited in Filing	Papers filed yesterday in the divorce of John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, by his wife contend that G.E. covered enormous living costs for them while he led the company and will continue to do so for him for the rest of his life. The extent of these benefits has never been disclosed by the company. General Electric has reported that Mr. Welch's total compensation, including bonus and salary, was $16.7 million in 2000, his last full year at the company before his retirement last September. It has also said that he will remain a consultant to the company on a retainer of $86,000 a year and will continue to have access to G.E. services and facilities.

Duke had planned to open five plants in 2003, and construction on three of those has been suspended, Harvey Padewer, Duke's group president for energy services, said in a presentation at an energy conference in New York. He did not say how long the turbine orders might be delayed or provide other details, but said that Duke is not considering canceling the orders.
2002-09-05	ABB to Sell Its Finance Unit to G.E. for $2.3 Billion	ABB said today that it had agreed to sell most of its financing unit to General Electric for $2.3 billion in cash. The Zurich-based ABB, a Swiss-Swedish builder of heavy machinery and electric power systems, is selling assets to pay off debt as it grapples with slumping demand for its products and mounting costs of asbestos-related lawsuits. The company has suffered a series of embarrassments in the last year, including a narrowly averted financial crisis and a public dispute with two former senior executives over their large retirement pay packages.
2002-08-14	Companies Certify Data Today; Some Seem Quite Confused	Top executives at nearly half the companies required to do so have certified their financial statements ahead of today's deadline. But many companies remained confused last night about their responsibilities and potential penalties. Most companies are expected to file the statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have been reviewing their figures and consulting with their lawyers for weeks. After such a review, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced a modest earnings restatement yesterday.
2002-08-09	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about a $1 million settlement between General Electric and the Consumer Product Safety Commission involving defective switches in dishwashers made in the 1980's misstated the period in which the company received 49 complaints. It was over six years, not all in 1992.
2002-08-08	G.E. in $1 Million Settlement on Product Safety Issue	The Consumer Product Safety Commission plans to announce a $1 million settlement today with General Electric for what the agency said was the company's failure to report defects involving more than three million dishwashers made in the 1980's. The commission is also scheduled to make public a $400,000 settlement offer from the Briggs & Stratton Corporation, which the agency said withheld information about faulty engines in go-carts.
2002-08-03	TRW TO SELL NOVASENSOR UNIT TO GENERAL ELECTRIC	The General Electric Company agreed to buy the NovaSensor unit of TRW to increase sales of sensors for the manufacturing, medical and automotive industries. Terms were not disclosed. NovaSensor, which is based in Fremont, Calif., will become part of the measurement and sensing business within the GE Industrial Systems unit. GE Industrial Systems, based in Plainville, Conn., provided about $4.4 billion of General Electric's $125.7 billion in sales last year. General Electric is based in Fairfield, Conn. TRW, based in Cleveland, agreed last month to be acquired by the Northrop Grumman Corporation, of Los Angeles, which has said it will sell or spin off some of TRW's businesses.
2002-08-01	THE MARKETS: Market Place; G.E. Joining Move Toward New Way To Count Options	General Electric, the nation's biggest company by stock market value, yesterday joined a small but growing group of companies that are changing how they account for stock options. G.E. went even further by saying that top executives would no longer be allowed to take profits immediately after cashing in options. Responding to criticism that options-heavy pay packages have given executives enormous incentives to create short-term profits, G.E. said it would require its top officers to hold, for at least a year, some of the shares they get after exercising options. It also said those officers would have to hold substantial stock positions as long as they work at the company.

American Express said it would write down its WorldCom debt of about $90 million, most of which is in the investment portfolio of American Express Financial Advisers. The write-down, the company warned, would probably result in a pretax investment loss in the second quarter of $75 million to $80 million.

Druck shares rose 1.2 percent, to £3.48. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)
2013-12-23	G.E. CHIEF SAYS COMPANY MAY MEET EARNINGS GOALS	The chief executive of General Electric said yesterday that the company was on track to meet its earnings goals for the year. But the company will face pressure over the next several years because of lower gas turbine sales, said the executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt. He said the company was on track to earn more than $16.5 billion, or $1.65 to $1.67 a share, for 2002, excluding accounting changes. The company also remains comfortable with analysts' 2003 earnings projections calling for double-digit earnings growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call expect earnings of $1.65 a share in 2002 and $1.82 in 2003.

2002-04-23	Court Denies Request By NBC to Dismiss Harassment Suits	The General Electric Company's NBC television network must defend lawsuits by five employees who say they suffered pervasive racial and sexual harassment during their years working as technicians, a federal judge ruled today. The employees say co-workers and supervisors posted racist cartoons, made sexist comments and denied them job opportunities that were afforded to white men. When they filed their lawsuits two years ago, the plaintiffs said they wanted more than $200 million in damages.
2002-04-21	Dredging the Upper Hudson River, Without Slinging the Mud	A lot of people along this stretch of the Hudson River see Saratoga Springs, 10 miles west and a few dollars up on the economic scale, as a place with its nose in the air. So when word got out this spring that the federal Environmental Protection Agency had chosen Saratoga Springs for its upstate field office -- the staging area for its long-delayed program to dredge the Hudson of its PCB pollution -- the reaction was swift. A Fort Edward newspaper published a cartoon showing E.P.A. workers in biohazard suits sipping Champagne at a lawn party with the horse-and-pearls set.

Andrew Lack, who had been president of NBC News, would become president and chief operating officer. As described by both men at the time, the arrangement seemed simple enough: Mr. Wright would focus more on long-term strategy while devoting time to his other position as vice chairman of the General Electric Company, the parent of NBC. Mr. Lack would focus more on day-to-day management, working, as he put it then, ''in the trenches.''
2002-04-14	Wait a Second: What Devils Lurk In the Details?	ARE the glory days of nonstop earnings growth over at the General Electric Company? Management doesn't appear to think so. Last Thursday, when G.E. reported its first-quarter results, Keith S. Sherin, the chief financial officer, was decidedly upbeat. Acknowledging that the business environment remains difficult, he pointed to the company's strong balance sheet and the diversity of G.E.'s businesses and said they enabled the company to produce what he called consistently excellent earnings growth. ''The business model works,'' Mr. Sherin proclaimed.
2002-04-13	F.C.C. CLEARS SALE OF TELEVISION STATION TO NBC	The Granite Broadcasting Corporation, a television broadcaster with stations in New York and California, said it received federal approval to sell a San Francisco affiliate, KNTV, to the General Electric Company's NBC unit. The Paxson Communications Corporation had filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission to block the sale because of a legal dispute with NBC, Granite said. Granite, based in New York, did not provide more details about the approval. KNTV became the NBC San Francisco affiliate on Jan. 1.
2002-04-13	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the first-quarter financial results at General Electric misstated the number of the company's businesses that reported a decline in revenue. Sales fell at 27 of the company's 36 businesses; they did not fall at all of them. The article also misstated the number of quarterly reporting periods G.E. has had under its chairman, Jeffrey R. Immelt. It is three, not one.
2002-04-12	Revenue Flat as G.E. Profit Drops on Accounting Shift	Battling sales declines in every one of its businesses, the General Electric Company said yesterday that its revenue was essentially flat in the first quarter and that net profit fell because of a change in accounting. Investors dumped the company's shares, slicing almost $35 billion in market value off G.E. The stock closed at $33.75, down $3.45, or 9.3 percent. Almost 79 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the most active stock traded there yesterday. G.E.'s fall also contributed to steep declines in both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
2002-04-12	G.E. to Buy Enron Wind-Turbine Assets	General Electric has won a bankruptcy auction for the Enron Wind Corporation's wind-turbine manufacturing assets, with a bid of about $358 million. General Electric won the court-supervised auction after increasing its offer by $100 million.
2002-04-11	Seeking Ways to Sell Enron's Plant in India	Thirty lenders have backed away from a threat to seize the $2.9 billion Dabhol power plant controlled by Enron, opting to appoint a group of advisers to recommend what to do now that Enron has filed for bankruptcy protection. Indian banks, which have lent almost $1.5 billion for the project, have sought to protect themselves after the project's sole customer, a local utility, fell $240 million behind in payments for power and after Enron, which owns 65 percent of the plant, collapsed amid an accounting scandal.
2002-04-10	G.E. Offers an Active Role In the Hudson PCB Cleanup	The General Electric Company, which spent millions of dollars arguing that dredging the Hudson River to remove its industrial pollution would be environmentally disastrous, has quietly signaled that it may now be ready to participate in the cleanup -- and in fact may take on much of the work itself. The company, which spilled and discharged tons of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, from its factories north of Albany, said in a filing late Monday with the federal Environmental Protection Agency that it would negotiate with the government in ''good faith'' about removing the chemicals, which have been linked to cancer in humans and other problems in fish and wildlife.
2002-04-07	Hudson Taken Off Endangered Rivers List	THE Hudson River, which last year appeared near the top of a roster of America's most endangered rivers, is off the list -- at least for now. The list, compiled annually by the Washington-based conservation group American Rivers, ranks the country's rivers by considering ''imminent and avoidable'' environmental threats with the waterways' national or regional significance. The Hudson was fourth on the list last year as the federal government was weighing a decision that would force General Electric Corporation to dredge the river of PCB's it had dumped there for decades.
2002-04-05	G.E. AGREES TO PAY $120 MILLION FOR A COMDISCO UNIT	General Electric said yesterday that it had agreed to buy a health care equipment leasing unit from Comdisco, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, for $120 million. G.E. also agreed to assume about $45 million of debt. The sale to GE Capital, General Electric's financing arm, is subject to approval by a bankruptcy court in Illinois and could be outbid, Comdisco said. Comdisco, which leases computers and equipment for electronics, telecommunications, health care and other industries, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.
2002-03-31	Private Sector; Taking G.E. on the Grand Tour	IT'S been more than three months since Ferdinando Beccalli was appointed General Electric's first chief executive for Europe. By his reckoning, he has not slept three nights in the same bed since. He's been traipsing around Europe, visiting customers, regulators -- yes, including Mario Monti, the European Union commissioner who scuttled G.E.'s merger with Honeywell International last year -- and employees.
2002-03-28	XEROX RECEIVES $557 MILLION IN FINANCING	The Xerox Corporation received $557 million from General Electric as part of a plan for its GE Capital finance arm to take over most of the equipment financing for Xerox's customers. The deal is secured, Xerox said, by $266 million in lease receivables from the United States and $291 million from Canada. The company also set up customer-financing agreements for Mexico and Brazil. Terms were not disclosed. Xerox now has about $4.8 billion in cash. The chief executive, Anne M. Mulcahy, has turned to third-party financing because Xerox's credit rating, which is below investment grade, prevents it from borrowing at competitive rates.
2002-03-24	It's Time for Investors to Start Acting Like Owners	YOU know that investors have left La-La Land when a titan like General Electric is taken to the woodshed by one of them. Last Wednesday, William H. Gross, manager of the world's largest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management, castigated G.E., saying it was not disclosing enough about its operations or financing needs to bond investors. Mr. Gross's comments on Pimco's Web site followed G.E.'s issuance of $11 billion in debt and filing of a $50 billion shelf offering, letting it come to market for that money any time.
2002-03-24	The Perils Of Relying Too Heavily On Credit	IF the debt market allowed you to sell short-term i.o.u.'s nearly as cheaply as the federal government does, would you do it? General Electric, one of the country's few companies that receive top ratings from credit agencies, has been doing just that for years. But last week the company got into a flap with a big buyer of its commercial paper, Pacific Investment Management, known as Pimco.
2002-03-22	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Receiver For Power Project	In a victory for Indian creditors of Dabhol Power, the mothballed $2.9 billion electric power project principally owned by the Enron Corporation, a court in Bombay issued an order prohibiting Dabhol from filing for bankruptcy protection or liquidation in any American court. The Bombay court also ordered the appointment of a receiver to safeguard the company's assets. The creditors have been trying to auction Enron's 65 percent interest in the project, and the smaller stakes of General Electric and Bechtel, to satisfy debts. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2002-03-22	Technology Briefing | Hardware: NBC Discloses TiVo Stake	General Electric can acquire as much as 8.3 percent of TiVo, G.E. said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. G.E., through its NBC unit, owns one million shares of TiVo common stock for a 2.3 percent stake, and holds securities convertible into 2.9 million common shares, the filing said. In 2001, TiVo, a subscription-based television provider, announced a private placement of $51.75 million of convertible debt and warrants. G.E. said it had invested $10 million as part of that placement. It acquired the common stock at TiVo's initial public offering in 1999.
2002-03-21	G.E. Faulted For Strategy On Growth	William Gross, a widely respected bond fund manager, sharply criticized General Electric yesterday, saying that G.E. is using acquisitions to drive its growth rate and is relying too much on short-term financing. Mr. Gross, manager of the $52 billion Pimco Total Return mutual fund, the world's largest bond fund, said that G.E.'s strategy reminded him of that used by failed conglomerates in the 1960's, like LTV. Pacific Investment Management Company, his fund group, will no longer buy short-term G.E. debt, he said.
2002-03-16	G.E. Weighs Sale of a Unit That Insures Other Insurers	General Electric is considering selling its commercial insurance business just as the industry is rebounding from heavy losses from the September terrorist attacks, people close to the company said yesterday. Prices for coverage are soaring and analysts are predicting a new era of profitability. A sale of the business, the Employers Reinsurance Company, would mean that G.E. would not share in any future insurance profits of the unit, which deals mainly in property-casualty. Analysts said, however, that G.E. would probably receive its best price for the unit while the outlook was rapidly improving.
2002-03-13	CALPINE GETS $1.6 BILLION CREDIT TO FORTIFY ITS FINANCES	The Calpine Corporation, a builder and operator of power plants, delayed or canceled $3 billion of turbine purchases and obtained $1.6 billion in bank credit to shore up its finances. Cancellation penalties and unrefunded deposits on 35 General Electric Company turbines will reduce profit by $98 million this quarter, the chief executive, Peter Cartwright, said. Calpine also deferred delivery and payment on 81 more turbines from General Electric, Siemens and the Toshiba Corporation. Calpine reduced the amount it is spending on turbines by $1.2 billion this year and $1.8 billion in 2003.
2002-03-13	GE CAPITAL PLANS TO RAISE $6 BILLION IN DEBT SALE	The General Electric Company's financing unit plans to raise $6 billion in the biggest corporate debt sale this year, tapping the bond market before an economic recovery drives up borrowing costs. The GE Capital Corporation, which generates half its parent's revenue, will sell the bonds as soon as today. GE Capital will sell $2 billion of three-year floating-rate notes, $1 billion of five-year fixed-rated notes and $3 billion of 30-year bonds, a GE Capital spokeswoman, Marissa Moretti, said. The sale would top the Weyerhaeuser Company's $5.5 billion offering last week.
2002-03-09	In Post-Enron World, G.E. Increases the Financial Information in Its Annual Report	General Electric, worried that it might be tarred with the Enron brush, released its annual report yesterday with fanfare, saying the financial section ''contains approximately 30 percent more content,'' including more information on results of operating segments. ''We manage businesses, not earnings,'' Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman, wrote in his letter to shareholders. ''G.E. is a company you can trust, delivering excellent earnings achieved with integrity and a transparency unsurpassed in global business.''
2002-03-05	For Executives, Nest Egg Is Wrapped in a Security Blanket	General Electric allows its top executives to contribute money to a retirement fund on which the company recently guaranteed an annual return of at least 10 percent, far better than a typical G.E. worker saving money in the company's 401(k) plan can expect. Tenneco Automotive, which makes shock absorbers, permits its executives to receive a full pension at age 55, seven years before the company's other employees can.
2002-03-01	ANTITRUST REGULATORS IN EUROPE TO LOOK INTO G.E. DEAL	General Electric's planned purchase of Unison Industries, a maker of aircraft engine parts, will be investigated by European antitrust regulators after four countries ruled that it might affect competition, the British Department of Trade and Industry said. Regulators in Britain, France, Germany and Spain have asked the European Commission to look into the takeover, the department said. ''We have only done this once before,'' a spokeswoman for the department said. ''The main thing of interest is the vertical relationship between Unison as a manufacturer of engine parts and G.E. as a manufacturer of engines.''
2002-02-28	Sale of Enron Asset in India Runs Into a String of Setbacks	The sale of the Dabhol Power project, one of the Enron Corporation's biggest assets overseas and one of its most troublesome, has become mired in delays and confusion, not least over who is in charge. Enron owns 65 percent of the $2.9 billion project, which was built to supply electricity to the state utility in Maharashtra, the Indian state surrounding Bombay. Two companies involved in building the plant, General Electric and Bechtel, each own 10 percent, and the utility owns the rest. Payment arrears and a pricing dispute with the utility led Enron, which managed the project, to shut it last June.
2002-02-26	Some spots fell short, but other commercials during Olympics were worthy of the gold.	AS the sun slowly sets on the tantrums, Roots berets and disqualifications of the 19th Olympic Winter Games, we bid a fond farewell to the trillions of commercials that appeared on NBC, CNBC and MSNBC and collectively exclaim, ''Well, it could have been worse.'' Because the Olympic commercials began only five days after a Super Bowl that was replete with tacky, tasteless and hyperpatriotic spots, there had been little hope that Madison Avenue could avoid a second straight stumble. But many commercials shown during the 17 days of the Winter Games were surprisingly better than expected, certainly surpassing the botched batches that made viewers cringe during the last few Olympics.
2002-01-29	World Business Briefing | Europe: France: G.E. Considers Acquisition	General Electric, which is pursuing acquisitions to revive sales, may bid for Legrand, a French maker of electrical products. Antitrust regulators ordered Schneider Electric to sell Legrand. ''It's a business we know very well and it's a situation that's in flux,'' G.E.'s chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, said in an interview. ''And it's one I would say we are studying.'' Buying Legrand would help Mr. Immelt with his goal of expanding in Europe after the European Union blocked General Electric's $47 billion purchase of Honeywell International in July.
2002-01-25	A determined effort to recruit mentors to work with youths.	AN ambitious campaign meant to change behavior, not sell products, is under way, the first of its scope since Sept. 11 that is unrelated to the terrorist attacks. The public service campaign seeks to recruit adults as mentors for children by designating January as what 17 nonprofit organizations hope will be the first annual National Mentoring Month.
2002-01-18	Profits Increase at G.E., But Sales Are Off 2.9%	The General Electric Company said today that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 9.7 percent as it cut costs and sales fell. Net income increased to $3.93 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with $3.59 billion, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
2001-12-30	Spots and Fumes, Begone!	DRY cleaning may be a lifesaver when it comes to removing stains and laundering delicate fabrics, but perchloroethylene, the solvent commonly known as perc that is the workhorse for most dry cleaners, has long raised concerns as a potential carcinogen and an environmental pollutant. Dry cleaning employees have complained of fumes in their workplace, while customers have noticed residual odors in their clothes and worried about the impact of the chemical not only on their wardrobe, but also on their skin. Some, like Jay DeSimone, owner of Good Earth Health Foods in Mount Kisco, refuse to visit the dry cleaner altogether. ''Even if the label says 'dry-clean only,' '' she said, ''I'll hand-wash it in cold water instead.''
2001-12-20	Katie Couric Signs NBC Contract Said to Be Largest in TV News	NBC and Katie Couric, the anchor of its ''Today'' show, agreed yesterday to what is believed to be the largest financial deal ever signed in television news, reaching beyond $60 million for the next four and a half years. Executives close to the negotiations said that Ms. Couric would receive compensation of $15 million to $16 million a year, in a deal structured to include both salary and stock in NBC's parent company, General Electric. The new figure represents a big jump from the estimated $7 million to $10 million a year she had been earning. The deal's negotiations had been widely discussed in the media for weeks, most recently when The New York Post reported similar figures last week.
2001-12-19	G.E. TO BUY INTERLOGIX FOR $777 MILLION	General Electric said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Interlogix Inc. for about $777 million in cash and stock, adding commercial and residential security equipment to its line of products. Interlogix shareholders will get $38.86 a share, a 35 percent premium, General Electric said. Interlogix, based in Austin, Tex., has about $600 million in sales a year. The company's video and integrated systems link security devices to a central control. General Electric, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., said the products would complement many of the components already made by its GE Industrial Systems unit, which makes power and factory controls. Separately, General Electric said it would cut 3,000 jobs at its GE Capital unit and will exit some financing businesses to reduce expenses.
2001-12-13	A Former Boss Tries to Put Honeywell on a New Path	In July, when Lawrence A. Bossidy came out of retirement to once again take the reins at Honeywell International, he was simply floored by the contrast between the company he had left in April 2000 and the one that welcomed him back. It seemed as though Honeywell's people, distracted and demoralized by the General Electric Company's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to acquire the company, had spent more of 2001 worrying -- and job hunting -- than they had cutting costs or integrating two disparate cultures. Earnings and the share price had plunged.
2001-12-09	The G.E. Racehorses, One Year Afterward	About this time last year, the horse race to succeed John F. Welch Jr. as the head of General Electric ended. Jeffrey R. Immelt got the job. In an instant, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing snared W. James McNerney Jr., one of the two also-rans, and Home Depot grabbed Robert L. Nardelli, the other. Other companies in need of leadership could only watch with envy. So, how have these most wanted done? If stock prices are any indication, Home Depot got the best deal. On Dec. 4, 2000, the day Mr. Nardelli became chief executive, it closed at $40.75 a share. A year later, it was up 17 percent, at $47.70.
2001-12-09	Cleaning the Hudson	To the Editor: The decision by Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, to go ahead with dredging the Hudson for PCB-rich sediment (news article, Dec. 5) is great news for the Hudson River ecosystem and for citizens of New York State. The E.P.A. has already successfully dredged a major Superfund site on the Hudson near West Point with no apparent ill effects. There is no reason to believe that dredging for PCB's will have more than minor and ephemeral effects.

2001-12-05	Paxson Communications Moves To Bar NBC Bid for Telemundo	Accusing NBC of breach of contract, the Paxson Communications Corporation said yesterday that it would ask the government to block NBC's planned $2.7 billion acquisition of the Spanish-language television network Telemundo. NBC, a division of General Electric, bought 32 percent of Paxson in 1999 for $415 million and had an option to buy a controlling stake in the broadcaster within 10 years. But if NBC adds the Telemundo stations, it could not acquire Paxson under existing Federal Communications Commission regulations, Paxson contends. That would put Paxson's future in doubt.
2001-11-13	Some Experts Suspect Engine Failure in Jet's Sudden Destruction	The National Transportation Safety Board said tonight that a preliminary play-through here of the cockpit voice recorder from the American Airlines plane that crashed this morning near Kennedy International Airport showed that the crew was apparently unaware of a problem until just before the crash. The tape has a good quality recording, the board said. But in a news conference tonight at the airport, the board's chairwoman, Marion Blakey, and a member, George W. Black Jr., did not give a hint why the plane, an Airbus A-300, went down shortly after takeoff.
2001-11-04	Private Sector; Great Expectations at GE Medical	YOU think Jeffrey R. Immelt has a tough job, following Jack Welch as chairman of General Electric? Try being Joseph M. Hogan, who is following Mr. Immelt as chief executive of GE Medical Systems. Mr. Immelt does not have his predecessor looking over his shoulder. But Mr. Hogan reports to the very man who turned GE Medical Systems, once a lackluster group, into an $8.5 billion powerhouse. ''I view medical systems as a key business for future growth,'' Mr. Immelt said, ''and Joe knows that.''
2001-11-03	G.E.'s Tax Breaks	To the Editor: Re ''Shame in the House,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Oct. 29): The House of Representatives' economic stimulus package will provide General Electric with $670 million in tax breaks. It would be an even better package if the economic windfall that G.E. will receive stimulates Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company's chief executive, to review G.E.'s steadfast opposition to the long-overdue $460 million cleanup of the Hudson River. CHRISTIAN BALLANTYNE Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Oct. 29, 2001 The writer is director of the Sierra Club's Hudson River Campaign.
2001-10-30	With Hughes Sale, G.M. Buries a Discarded Strategy	General Motors can no longer be confused with General Electric. G.M.'s planned sale of its Hughes Electronics unit marks the company's final retreat from a strategy of buying technology and engineering prowess in the hopes of bolstering its core car business.
2001-10-28	Bin Laden Family, With Deep Western Ties, Strives to Re-establish a Name	In the week after the Sept. 11 attacks, Abdullah bin Laden picked up the telephone at his penthouse in Cambridge, Mass., and began dialing for some expert advice. This time, it seemed, his half brother Osama bin Laden might have finally shattered the family's reputation, especially for those members who lived in the United States.
2001-10-20	G.E. Role in Satellite Concern to Rise	A Luxembourg company, the Société Européenne des Satellites S.A., will give the General Electric Company a larger stake in itself to pay for G.E.'s satellite unit after postponing a new public share sale. SES, which agreed to buy GE American Communications in March for $5 billion in cash and stock, will increase General Electric's holding in the merged entity, an SES spokesman, Yves Feltes, said. The company postponed the share sale because of declining markets.
2001-10-12	Earnings Increase 3% at General Electric	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 3 percent over the same period last year, despite huge insurance losses related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Without those losses, which carved 4 cents a share off earnings, the increase would have been 16 percent. G.E. also vowed to generate double-digit earnings growth this year and next. Investors were pleased with the results and with G.E.'s announcement that its NBC unit would buy Telemundo Communications Group. G.E. shares rose $1.04, to $38.95.
2001-10-12	NBC Is Paying $1.98 Billion For Telemundo	Acknowledging the importance of the fast-growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States, NBC agreed yesterday to buy the Telemundo Communications Group, the nation's second-largest Spanish-language broadcaster, for $1.98 billion. The transaction is the largest acquisition of a foreign-language broadcaster in the United States by one of the major television networks, and demonstrates the pressure on the television industry to expand into new areas at a time when the market for network television is rapidly eroding.
2001-10-10	Would-Be Raider of Blue-Chip Companies Is the Talk of Wall Street	Ade O. Ogunjobi, a college dropout who describes himself as an entrepreneur, wants to be the next great corporate raider. He may be just a joker. His Los Angeles-based company, Toks Inc., said yesterday that it planned to make tender offers for General Electric; AOL Time Warner; General Motors; the Hughes Electronics unit of G.M.; AT&T; AT&T Wireless; and Marriott International. The offers, which Toks valued at $2 trillion, were quickly declared a hoax by most of the companies. ''We're as mystified as anyone,'' said Toni Simonetti, a spokeswoman for General Motors. ''It seems pretty far out on the edge.''
2001-10-10	PCB's in the Hudson	To the Editor: You report (news article, Oct. 3) that the Environmental Protection Agency is considering inserting performance standards in its directive now on how the General Electric Company should dredge the Hudson River of PCB's, rather than during the design phase of the project, as is customary. You also report a possible move to administer the project from Washington rather than from the E.P.A. regional office in New York. To adopt performance standards before the design of the cleanup project may jeopardize the entire project. And to move management of the project to Washington would do nothing but politicize it.
2001-10-09	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Compaq and GE Aircraft In Venture	The Compaq Computer Corporation said yesterday that it signed a five-year agreement to deliver services and technology infrastructure to GE Aircraft Engines in North and South America. The deal, valued at $95 million, expands on an existing arrangement dating from 1993. Under the agreement, Compaq will provide desktop support and help-desk services, inventory and equipment management and database administration, said Jeff Lynn, general manager of Compaq Global Services. All of these services will be centrally managed through a dedicated Compaq program office, which continually monitor GE Aircraft operations. Compaq shares rose 23 cents, to $9.05.

2001-10-05	G.E. and the Hudson	To the Editor: Roughly half the toxic PCB's in the New York Harbor have chemical ''fingerprints'' tracing them to General Electric's factories 200 miles upriver. Now there's something else that may have G.E.'s fingerprints all over it -- the Environmental Protection Agency's long-awaited cleanup plan for the Hudson River (news article, Oct. 1).
2001-10-03	Environmentalists Oppose Shift on Hudson Dredging	A half-dozen environmentalists told officials at the Environmental Protection Agency here today that they opposed altering the government's half-billion-dollar directive on how the General Electric Company should dredge the Hudson River of poisonous chemicals. The agency is considering inserting specific performance standards in its directive now rather than during the next three years of analysis in the design phase of the project, as is customary.
2001-10-01	G.E. Is Accused of Trying to Undercut Order to Dredge Hudson River	New York State officials and environmental groups say they are worried that General Electric is trying to sabotage the landmark federal order that the company dredge the Hudson River to remove poisonous chemicals. Company representatives have been meeting with officials of the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, pressing G.E.'s cause and prompting what state officials described as a rift with the officials in the agency's New York regional office, which has been overseeing the case for years.
2001-09-23	Some Straight Talk, Without a Step Back	TO publish a successful book, you often must create a certain amount of hype. John F. Welch Jr. and Warner Books knew that as they geared up to publish the memoirs of Mr. Welch, who retired as chairman and chief executive of General Electric on Sept. 7. ''Jack: Straight From the Gut,'' was distributed to bookstores after his retirement, but excerpts had already appeared in business magazines and in Vanity Fair (with photographs by Annie Leibovitz, no less). Relying on the reach of both Warner's parent company, AOL Time Warner, and G.E.'s own NBC television network, Mr. Welch whipped up a media frenzy until Sept. 11, when publicity events surrounding the book were canceled because of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
2001-09-23	The Chairman and the Anchor	JOHN F. WELCH JR. was particularly worried about Lou Dobbs, the business news anchor who walked away from a relationship with CNBC and returned to its main rival, CNN, in May. In his book, Mr. Welch describes how he became deeply involved in a CNBC effort to help fight a ''war'' against Mr. Dobbs, who upon his return to CNN ''Moneyline'' quickly helped it improve its ratings.
2001-09-22	Attack Further Delays a Final Decision on Hudson Dredging	The terrorist attack in New York has further delayed the Environmental Protection Agency's final decision on a $460 million plan for General Electric to dredge the Hudson River of poisonous chemicals. Christie Whitman, the agency's administrator, was scheduled to issue a final decision on the project on Thursday. But the decision was delayed even before the terrorist attack Sept. 11 on the World Trade Center. The attack then forced the agency to evacuate its New York regional offices, which are four blocks from the World Trade Center, and only today was any employee allowed to re-enter the offices.
2001-09-15	For Insurers, Some Failures And Rate Jumps	The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center will cause the cost of commercial coverage to rise by at least 20 percent as insurers struggle to recoup losses in the worst insurance disaster in history, insurers and analysts said yesterday. Even then, they said, some insurance companies are certain to fail under the burden of claims that may run as high as $30 billion to $40 billion.
2001-09-14	Winning the Business Game With a Few Basic Principles	JACK Straight From the Gut By Jack Welch, with John A. Byrne Illustrated. 479 pages. Warner Business Books. $29.95 Any chief corporate executive whose company's stock price increased nearly 3,000 percent in the 20 years he was boss is the kind of businessman other captains (and would-be captains) of industry want to listen to. Or at least that is what Warner Books seemed to be thinking when it paid Jack Welch, the recently retired chairman and chief executive of General Electric, an advance of some $7 million for a book in which he would reveal his business history. The size of the advance, combined with Mr. Welch's living-legend status, ensured that his new book, ''Jack: Straight From the Gut,'' would be one of the most anticipated business books of all time.
2001-09-13	G.E. and Honeywell Appeal Europe's Rejection of Deal	The General Electric Company and Honeywell International Inc. have appealed the European Commission's rejection of their $45 billion merger, the European Court of Justice said today.

A spokeswoman for General Electric, Louise Binns, confirmed the appeal but declined to give details.

For the book business, the question of the season is how the literary marketplace will treat Jack Welch, the newly retired chairman of General Electric whose memoir goes on sale tomorrow. Mr. Welch's $7.1 million advance and the 1.2-million-copy first run -- both unprecedented for a business book -- have everyone wondering if Time Warner, the publisher, has finally found the book that can replicate the success of ''Iacocca,'' Lee Iacocca's autobiography that became a best seller in the mid-80's, selling millions of copies. ''Iacocca'' was monumental in publishing, and a bevy of imitators hoped a new and lucrative genre had been born. But although business books have exploded in popularity since then, no other C.E.O. book has come close to doing what ''Iacocca'' did. The number of chief executives who have sold even half a million copies can be counted on one hand.
2001-09-09	'Neutron Jack' Exits	Jack Welch vacated the executive suite last week after a two-decade run at the helm of General Electric, one of America's most successful companies, leaving behind a remarkable record of achievement and upheaval. Mr. Welch was a white-collar revolutionary, bent throughout his career at G.E. on championing radical change and smashing the complacency of the established order. His legacy is not only a changed G.E., but a changed American corporate ethos, one that prizes nimbleness, speed and regeneration over older ideals like stability, loyalty and permanence. The General Electric Mr. Welch took over when he became chief executive in 1981 was the iconic corporation of the American century, the descendant of Thomas Edison's ingenuity. It had a hand in inventing the light bulb, the electric locomotive, steam turbines, the refrigerator, electric meters and motors, the jet engine, Silly Putty and synthetic diamonds. It was also an unflappable supertanker, unfamiliar with speedy change.
2001-09-09	Private Sector; On the Road Again, Happily	John F. Welch Jr., once known for hot-tempered volatility, seems almost unflappable these days. He smiles a lot, jokes a lot, teases visitors, absolutely exudes relaxed bonhomie. But that's not because his grueling 20-year tenure at the helm of General Electric ended on Friday. It's because his book, ''Jack: Straight From the Gut,'' hits stores this week, and he doesn't have to tweak it anymore. ''Writing a book is brutal, exhausting, tormenting, but everyone should do it when they leave a company,'' Mr. Welch said on Tuesday. ''It lets you reflect on things and close the chapter. Now I can really do the things that I love.'' So what are they? Well, he has set himself up as a coach to a half-dozen other chief executives, whom he won't identify but characterized as ''all winners'' who want him to hone their leadership skills. ''It's my dream job,'' Mr. Welch enthused, one that he'll be doing from a rented office in Shelton, Conn., 10 minutes from his Fairfield home. But some command performances come first, starting on Tuesday with an interview on ''Today'' (on G.E.-owned NBC, of course) and followed by myriad talks, TV appearances and parties in New York to plug the book. Then comes a book tour to more than a dozen cities in the United States, several in Europe and at least one in Asia.
2001-09-06	At G.E., Whither The House Jack Built?; His Successor Faces Skeptics And a Market Less in Awe	Officially, the baton does not pass until tomorrow. That's when Jeffrey R. Immelt takes over the top spot at the General Electric Company, and John F. Welch Jr. leaves. Tonight, there are the going-away festivities: some 200 people will gather at Crotonville, G.E.'s management school, for a roast of their departing chairman and chief executive. ''I'm going to get hammered,'' Mr. Welch laughingly predicted. But of course, the transition has been in progress for months. Since November, when Mr. Immelt was anointed as Mr. Welch's successor, G.E. aficionados have bandied about the question: Can ''the House That Jack Built'' thrive without Jack?
2001-08-31	G.E. AND QWEST FORM JOINT VENTURE FOR HOSPITAL IMAGING	General Electric and Qwest Communications International have formed a joint venture that will let hospitals store and retrieve digital images using a high-speed fiber optic network. The agreement, for three years, is expected to generate $250 million in revenue, the companies said. GE Medical Systems is the biggest maker of medical imaging machines. Qwest, a phone service provider, runs a 113,000-mile fiber optic network. GE Medical Systems is based in Waukesha, Wis., and has about $8 billion in annual revenue.
2001-08-26	Government Hypocrisy On Fire Island Project	The federal government recently decided to force General Electric to dredge a large section of the Hudson River, at great cost, to eliminate an environmental disturbance to the river. This same government created an environmental disturbance by building a series of jetties in Westhampton Beach that interrupted the natural movement of sand along the South Shore, causing accelerated beach erosion on Fire Island. The Fire Island beach replenishment project proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers was budgeted for $52 million, a bag of seashells compared to what it will cost G.E. in its endeavor on the Hudson. Yet in April the federal government reneged on its responsibility to Fire Island, considering the project too costly.
2001-08-24	G.E. Plans to Shut Factory	General Electric plans to close a Philadelphia plant where 216 workers make protection devices for industrial turbines. The company expects to buy the devices from outside to cut costs. Nearly half the workers are eligible for early retirement, said a spokeswoman for GE Industrial Systems, the division that makes the equipment. The plant mostly supplies another unit, GE Power Systems.
2001-08-02	Hudson Debate Goes On Despite E.P.A. Decision	A retired fisherman, Henry Nichols, is so looking forward to having the river back that when the expected dredging begins in the near future to clean the bottom, he said, the workmen ''can dump the stuff right here in my field if they like.'' But two of his upriver neighbors, Jim and Claude Duket, who never stopped fishing, are anticipating it more mournfully, certain that the dredging will kick up contaminants and ruin the best fishing in these parts in decades.
2001-08-02	Mrs. Whitman Stays the Course	Environmentalists who have regularly been disappointed by the performance and policies of the Bush administration got something big to cheer about on Tuesday. It came in the form of a difficult and admirable decision by Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to proceed with a plan issued in the closing days of the Clinton administration requiring General Electric to spend nearly half a billion dollars to dredge PCB's from the Hudson River. The decision unites the Bush administration with an impressive list of senior politicians who have called for a cleanup, including not only Mrs. Whitman's Republican and Democratic predecessors but New York's governor, its two senators and most of its Congressional delegation. Under the circumstances, G.E.'s wisest and most statesmanlike course would be to concede defeat, drop its costly battle to avoid dredging and join the federal government, the state and the river communities in a sustained effort to clean the river.
2001-08-02	Contentious Details Await E.P.A. Cleanup Plan for Hudson	The decision by the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Christie Whitman, to proceed with an ambitious, expensive and complicated pollution cleanup plan for the Hudson River appears to have settled the most important overarching question about the river -- whether to dredge it to remove the PCB's on its bottom. But legal experts, environmentalists and politicians said there were inevitable skirmishes ahead in evaluating how the cleanup might proceed -- from the mechanics of its engineering to the way the dredging sites look or smell or block the boats on the water. They said those fights could be just as fierce as the battle, decades long, over whether to dredge.
2001-08-02	As Whitman Deliberated Plan, the Pressures Mounted	The pressure faced by Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, on whether to proceed with the dredging of the Hudson River was enormous. On one side were General Electric and its chairman, Jack Welch, who were major contributors to President Bush's presidential campaign. Backing the company were many of the residents of the rock-ribbed Republican communities along the upper Hudson River. They opposed the dredging plan, which would cost General Electric half a billion dollars, saying it would do more harm than good and could destroy the river's recreational and economic life.
2001-08-01	G.E. Said to Be Planning Appeal of Honeywell Decision	General Electric is planning to appeal the European Commission's decision to block its acquisition of Honeywell International, executives close to the company said yesterday. G.E.'s decision to appeal is not aimed at resurrecting the deal, the executives said, but is an effort to nullify the ruling that it has a dominant position in the aerospace sector. That ruling, if left unchallenged, could prevent G.E. from making future acquisitions -- both in the United States and in Europe -- because it certifies the view of European regulators that the company already has an overwhelming share of the market.
2001-08-01	WHITMAN TO ISSUE ORDER TO DREDGE HUDSON FOR PCB'S	The federal Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Christie Whitman, has agreed to go ahead with a plan issued in the closing days of the Clinton administration requiring the General Electric Company to spend more than half a billion dollars to dredge PCB pollution from the Hudson River, according to officials at the agency. The draft order, which will become official in 30 days after a government review, will set into motion the biggest environmental dredging plan in United States history, after more than two decades of disputes over the science of dredging and the political, economic and moral issues of corporate responsibility.
2001-07-31	G.E. Finance Unit Will Acquire Heller Financial for $5.3 Billion	General Electric's financial services subsidiary, GE Capital, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Heller Financial for $5.3 billion in cash, or $53.75 a share. Based in Chicago, Heller Financial provides commercial finance, equipment leasing and real estate finance to small to midsize companies in the United States and Europe.
2001-07-28	Pataki Backs Clinton Plan For Hudson River Cleanup	As the wait continued for a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency on dredging PCB's from the upper Hudson River, Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday clarified his stance, saying that he supported a cleanup along the lines that the Clinton administration proposed last year and seemingly distancing himself from any scaled-down plan. The governor, asked whether he would support a less ambitious dredging plan than the one the Environmental Protection Agency proposed in December, said: ''The point here is to clean up the river and to let science dictate what has to be done, not to look at other factors, other than to make sure we protect the communities, we protect the property owners and we do it in a way that is environmentally sound.''
2001-07-26	No Retreat on the Hudson	As President Bush's chief environmental officer, Christie Whitman has absorbed plenty of abuse for the administration's generally deplorable environmental record. Some of this criticism has been unfair, and in many cases she has taken the fall for policies dictated by others. But Mrs. Whitman will have only herself to blame if she chooses to scale back the Clinton administration's plan that would require General Electric to spend a half-billion dollars to begin the long-overdue task of cleaning the upper Hudson River of toxic chemicals known as PCB's. Rumors have been flying around all week that Mrs. Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, would shortly announce her own dredging plan, one that could well reduce the Clinton administration's plan to a mere pilot project followed by years of additional study and analysis. The reports -- none confirmed by Mrs. Whitman herself -- have emerged from various members of Congress with whom Mrs. Whitman has been conferring and from lower-echelon sources at her agency. Gov. George Pataki of New York took them seriously enough to call Mrs. Whitman on Tuesday and tell her, in firmer language than he has ever used publicly, that he supports the Clinton cleanup plan and that anything less would be unacceptable.
2001-07-25	PCB Cleanup May Include Less Dredging	With a decision imminent on dredging PCB's from the upper Hudson River, the Bush administration is seriously considering a plan to do a fraction of the dredging that the Clinton administration proposed last year, Democratic elected officials and environmentalists said today. Several of the people making that claim said they had heard it from people who had had contact with the office of Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who will make the decision. But none said they had learned of the plan directly from Mrs. Whitman's office.
2001-07-14	HONEYWELL CONSOLIDATING SOME DIVISIONS	Honeywell International will consolidate operations into four units, as the chief executive Lawrence Bossidy moves to reduce costs after General Electric's planned purchase of Honeywell collapsed. A spokesman, Tom Crane, said eight existing divisions would be consolidated into four: aerospace; automation and controls; specialty materials; and transportation and power units. In addition, the chief operating officer, Giannantonio Ferrari, 61, will retire immediately, Mr. Crane said. The realignment may be a precursor to breaking up the company, based in Morris Township, N.J., and selling the parts, analysts said.
2001-07-14	The New Laws of Nations	As economic interconnections increase among countries around the world, critics protest that this globalization is eroding the ability of governments to protect the interests of their citizens against those of multinational corporations. But the European Commission's recent blocking of the proposed merger of two American companies, General Electric and Honeywell, suggests otherwise. Since the merged company would have operated on both sides of the Atlantic, the merger hinged on the consent of not just one but two sets of regulators, each with its own legal tradition and its own interpretation of the public interest. And despite public relations campaigns by both companies, attempts at personal persuasion by G.E.'s formidable outgoing chief executive, Jack Welch, and the threat of retaliation by Congress, the European antitrust authorities rejected this merger, which had easily won approval from the United States Justice Department. In this case globalization strengthened rather than weakened government oversight of corporate activity.
2001-07-14	Left at the Altar; Jilted Merger Partners Increasingly Turn to the Courts	When a big merger broke down in years past, as they often did, the last thing corporate managers wanted was costly, distracting, time-consuming, risky litigation. But some companies recently ditched at the altar are preparing to drag their runaway merger partners into court.
2001-07-13	G.E. Reports 15% Increase In 2nd-Quarter Earnings	The General Electric Company, despite its first quarterly decline in revenues since 1988, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings were up 15 percent from the same quarter last year. It stands as the last complete quarter under John F. Welch Jr., who stayed on as chairman past his planned retirement to shepherd G.E.'s since-aborted acquisition of Honeywell International. G.E. said that he would retire on Sept. 7.
2001-07-12	Legacy of Poison in Twice-Excavated Yards	Tom Harrington's backyard in Queensbury, N.Y., looks much as it used to, except for a few telltale signs: the maple tree is smaller, the swing set is in a different place, and the lawn has strange lines running through it, like a bad hair implant. Last fall, most of Mr. Harrington's yard was dug out and replaced by the State Department of Environmental Conservation, at depths up to 20 feet, because it was contaminated with PCB's. So were the yards of several of his neighbors in Queensbury, a blue-collar suburb of Glens Falls in Warren County. Decades ago, many local people, trying to make a little extra money, took apart PCB-laden electric capacitors to remove the copper inside and sell it. They let the chemicals drip into the soil, leaving future generations a toxic legacy.
2001-07-11	G.E. to Give Dishwasher Refunds As Product Recall Is Questioned	Up to 5,000 New York State residents could qualify for refunds from the General Electric Company under a court finding that G.E. engaged in deceptive conduct in recalling potentially unsafe dishwashers, a state official said yesterday. Thousands of other state residents could be eligible for a free repair that would eliminate the fire hazard that led to the recall, said the official, Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer.
2001-07-08	In G.E.'s Wake, PCB's in the River	To the Editor: Re ''Jack Welch's Legacy'' (editorial, July 4): The PCB's that General Electric dumped in the upper Hudson River present serious health risks in addition to cancer.
2001-07-08	In G.E.'s Wake, PCB's in the River	To the Editor: The cancer risks posed by the PCB's that General Electric dumped in the upper Hudson River (editorial, July 4) are hardly confined to people who eat fish up there. Indeed, the oily substances become more concentrated as they move down the Hudson and up the food chain to humans. PCB levels in fish-eating Hudson River otters, for example, were more than three times the limit known to cause reproductive failure, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
2001-07-04	Honeywell Regroups as Chief Resigns	Hours after the European Commission rejected the $45 billion acquisition by General Electric of Honeywell International, Michael R. Bonsignore, the chairman and chief executive of Honeywell, tendered his resignation. The company, which is based in Morristown, N.J., also said it would take a pretax revamping charge of $575 million to $625 million in the second quarter and forecasted full-year revenue and earnings that were lower than consensus Wall Street estimates.
2001-07-04	Corrections	A front-page article yesterday about the effect of the collapse of the merger between General Electric and Honeywell International on the reputation of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., misstated the title of his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt. He is president and chairman-elect, not chief executive. The article also misidentified the company acquired by the Boeing Company in 1997 in a deal nearly blocked by the European Commission. It was the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, not the Lockheed Martin Corporation.
2001-07-04	Excerpts From Europe's Statement	Following are excerpts from the European Commission's statement yesterday on why it was blocking General Electric's proposed acquisition of Honeywell International: The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by General Electric of Honeywell. This follows an in-depth investigation in the markets for aeroengines, avionics and other aircraft components and systems. In adopting this decision, the commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by G.E. were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell.
2001-07-04	Europe Ends Bid by G.E. For Honeywell	As Europe's chief antitrust regulator bristled at what he called ''political interference'' from the United States, the European Commission today formally blocked General Electric's proposed $45 billion takeover of Honeywell International. The decision was already a foregone conclusion after negotiations broke off on Friday between G.E. and European officials. But the decision was a milestone, not only because European officials blocked a deal between two American companies but because United States antitrust regulators had made the opposite ruling.
2001-07-04	Jack Welch's Legacy	Yesterday the European Commission officially decided to block General Electric's merger with Honeywell. For G.E.'s chief executive officer, John F. Welch Jr., the deal would have been the capstone of an illustrious 20-year career at the helm of one of the world's biggest corporations. Now, in his last six months as boss, he has to clean up the aftermath of the botched merger instead. It is a last act that casts a shadow on Mr. Welch's reputation as an infallible visionary. But if he wants to leave his post on a heroic note, he could readily do so by turning his attention to a different, longstanding problem on which he has been stubbornly retrograde -- the overdue need to cleanse the Hudson River of PCB's. Mr. Welch has no truly attractive options for climbing free of the botched merger with Honeywell. He could do nothing and risk a lawsuit by Honeywell, whose board greeted G.E.'s abandoning of the merger with anger and disappointment. He could reformulate G.E.'s bid for Honeywell to make it more palatable to the commission, a move that would probably result in months of delays and, from Wall Street's perspective, a value-poor deal. Or he could challenge the commission's decision in the European Union's Court of First Instance, maintaining his reputation as a fighter but burdening his successor, Jeffrey Immelt, with a long legal battle.
2001-06-30	G.E. Rejects Honeywell Plan to Save Deal	General Electric's proposed acquisition of Honeywell International appeared all but dead yesterday after G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., rejected a last-ditch modification by Honeywell aimed at satisfying European regulators. Increasing friction between the companies emerged as G.E. seemed ready to give up on the deal and Honeywell tried to push it forward.
2001-06-29	Europe Indicates to G.E. New Offer Is Unacceptable	European regulators have told General Electric that its last-minute effort to revive its proposed acquisition of Honeywell International will not be enough, sounding a death knell for the $45 billion deal. While the position taken by the European Commission does not represent a final, official rejection, it leaves General Electric with only a few days to try to salvage the deal. Executives close to the company said late today that G.E. was unlikely to come back to the table with a new proposal.
2001-06-28	Economic Scene; In Europe, G.E. and Honeywell ran afoul of 19th-century thinking.

2001-06-28	G.E. Is Said To Float Plan To Save Deal	General Electric has held informal discussions with European regulators about selling a minority stake in its aviation financing business in hopes of winning approval for its proposed acquisition of Honeywell International, executives close to the talks said yesterday. The move is an about-face for G.E., which said last week that the chance of the deal moving forward was ''zero'' and that the proposal it submitted to the European Commission was final.
2001-06-27	THE MARKETS: Market Place; G.E.-Honeywell Deal: If at First . . .	Why is General Electric still vigorously lobbying regulators about its planned acquisition of Honeywell International if the deal is really dead? Maybe because it isn't -- or at least not yet. Top executives from G.E. and Honeywell, including G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., met on Monday to discuss ways of resuscitating negotiations with European regulators, according to executives close to the companies.
2001-06-26	Another Step In Killing Deal For Honeywell	A draft decision to block the proposed acquisition of Honeywell International by General Electric was endorsed today by a panel of European regulators. Competition regulators from the 15 nations of the European Union, except Greece, met with their counterparts at the European Commission all day today to give their opinions on the proposed decision. ''The member states fully backed the commission,'' a person close to the meeting said.
2001-06-24	Can G.E. Still Prosper Without Honeywell?	WORD that European regulators are on the verge of rejecting General Electric's $45 billion takeover of Honeywell International has drawn concerned statements from President Bush and members of the House and Senate as well as editorials in major newspapers. A final decision by the European Commission does not have to be made until July 12, and the jawboning might work. But last week, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the president and chairman-elect of G.E., said in Paris that the deal had ''zero'' chance of success.
2001-06-24	Reckonings; Trust And Antitrust	When the European Commission indicated it was likely to block the proposed merger between General Electric and Honeywell, American politicians from George W. Bush on down cried foul, with some alleging that the decision was politically motivated. They're almost certainly wrong about that, but it is true that the E.C.'s case against the merger is far from watertight. Mario Monti, Europe's competition referee, may have made a bad call on this play. Nonetheless, our politicians should lower their voices. Mr. Monti is one of the good guys in today's global economy. He should not be made the target of attempts at political intimidation.
2001-06-23	World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Insurer Acquired	Furthering its ambitions to expand in Britain, GE Capital, the financial services arm of the General Electric Company, has agreed to buy National Mutual, a British insurer, for £570 million ($807 million), the companies said. National Mutual, which began reviewing its status in March, said its 160,000 policyholders would receive £500 each as compensation for loss of their membership status. The company said policyholders who have so-called with-profits plans would get additional payments totaling about £290 million in the form of enhanced final bonuses. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)
2001-06-21	Market Place; Honeywell Torn Between Deal and Independence	Earlier this year, Honeywell International's chairman, Michael R. Bonsignore, expressed confidence that his company's efforts to integrate with the General Electric Company would pay off quickly once the deal was completed. The merger of the two companies, of course, seems to be unraveling because of opposition from European regulators. Honeywell would almost certainly remain a takeover target, but there might well be a long period where it must go it alone. And the efforts it has made to merge with G.E., while hurting it in the short run, could make it stronger in the long term.
2001-06-21	Merger-Busting in Europe	Jeffrey Immelt, president and chairman-elect of General Electric, says his company's chances of merging with Honeywell, another electronics and aircraft technology giant, have virtually evaporated. Though the interested parties are two American companies, and American regulators have approved the deal, the European Commission is blocking the union because of its perceived potential for dampening competition in global markets. If G.E. and Honeywell were to go ahead without the commission's approval, fines or bars to selling could result. We support the right of foreign governments, especially those of developing countries, to regulate American businesses that take dominant market positions in their jurisdictions. But the Europeans have not explained their position except to say that airlines, which have kept mum through the deal's review, share their concerns. Moreover, a collapse in this case will cast a dark shadow over corporate activity in the future.
2001-06-20	Europe Is Said To Be Closer To G.E. Rebuff	The European Commission has proposed rejecting the General Electric Company's $45 billion takeover of Honeywell International in a ''draft decision'' that it distributed to European Union members, executives close to the commission said yesterday. The advisory committee of Europe's competition regulators is expected to meet on Monday to review the preliminary decision. Blocking the transaction would be the first instance of European regulators' thwarting a deal by two American companies that had already received approval by American regulators.
2001-06-19	Europe Officials Appear to Bend Some on G.E. Deal	The European Commission appeared to narrow the distance today between what General Electric has offered and what the commission has demanded for approval of G.E.'s $45 billion aerospace merger with Honeywell International. In a statement, the commission said it would accept an offer short of a sale of the aircraft leasing unit, GE Capital Aviation Services. Some people close to the commission have said that the European regulators want General Electric to sell or spin off the unit outright.
2001-06-19	U.S. Businesses Turn to Europe To Bar Mergers	American companies intent on preventing rivals from merging are increasingly complaining to European regulators in preference to more permissive officials in the United States. In the most striking example so far of the Europeans' newfound power over businesses based in the United States, General Electric's planned $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International may be scuttled by European regulators in spite of approval for the deal in Washington.
2001-06-18	War of Words Heats Up Between Airbus and Boeing	The simmering rivalry between Airbus Industrie and the Boeing Company boiled over here today when Noël Forgeard, the chief executive of Airbus, lashed out at comments made by Harry C. Stonecipher, Boeing's vice chairman, in an interview with a French newspaper. Among other things, Mr. Stonecipher said in an interview in Le Monde on Saturday that Airbus was to blame for the European Commission's opposition to General Electric's proposed acquisition of Honeywell International. He said a new trade war could break out if the deal were blocked by the Europeans, which appears to be likely.
2001-06-17	G.E. Calls Its $45 Billion Bid For Honeywell All but Dead	Jeffrey R. Immelt, president of the General Electric Company, pronounced its proposed $45 billion takeover of Honeywell International all but dead today, but said that G.E. would wait to receive a final judgment from the European Commission next month. Antitrust regulators at the commission are concerned that the combined companies would have too much power in the market for aviation products like jet engines and navigation equipment. They had asked G.E. to spin off its lucrative aircraft leasing division and sell off Honeywell divisions worth billions of dollars. But G.E. refused, submitting its final offer to regulators last week.
2001-06-16	Europe Opens Door for G.E., Just Slightly	Amid signs of political pressure from the United States, the European Commission said today that a ''limited opportunity'' remained for General Electric to offer more concessions to win approval of its planned $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International, even though the deadline for new concessions had passed. President Bush said at a news conference in Warsaw today that ''we brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip.''
2001-06-15	G.E. Purchase Of Honeywell Now Appears Near Collapse	General Electric's planned acquisition of Honeywell International appeared near collapse today after G.E. said that its final concessions would probably not satisfy European regulators. While people close to the talks said that an agreement was still possible before the July 12 deadline set by the European Commission, General Electric's statement was unusually blunt.
2001-06-14	G.E. Chief Courts Europeans on Acquisition of Honeywell	In talks that illustrate the power that European regulators increasingly hold in American corporate deals, General Electric's chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., met twice today with the European competition commissioner in an effort to win approval for G.E.'s $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International. Executives close to the talks say that General Electric has offered to divest itself of assets worth as much as $3 billion in annual revenue. It has proposed selling its ground proximity warning systems business, its auxiliary power systems unit and its satellite collision-avoidance systems, the executives said. G.E. would also divest itself of Honeywell's regional jet engines, Honeywell's engine-starter businesses and aircraft maintenance business in Germany, according to the executives.
2001-06-13	G.E. to Offer Light Bulb That Rival Calls Inefficient	General Electric will unveil a new light bulb today that the company says will make colors appear more vivid. But a competitor accuses the company of acting irresponsibly. The bulb, called Reveal, filters out red, yellow and green light with a chemical element called neodymium, a rare-earth metal used in the coloring of glass.
2001-06-12	Europe Seems More Open To G.E. Merger	The General Electric Company's $45 billion takeover of Honeywell International Inc. has a ''reasonable chance'' of winning European approval, the head of the European Commission's antitrust department said today. Regulators have no ''definite view'' of how to curb G.E.'s plane-leasing unit, the biggest buyer of jets, Alexander Schaub, the European official, said in an interview. The commission is concerned that the leasing business would give G.E. an unfair advantage by enabling it to dominate the production of jet engines and airplane electronics.
2001-06-11	MediaTalk; The Executive Author Confronts Corporate Sprawl	Like other moguls in an era of intertwined alliances among media conglomerates, John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric, faces some delicate decisions about the publication of his memoirs: how to promote his book without doing too many favors for his company's competition. Mr. Welch sold the right to publish his book to AOL Time Warner's book publishing division for a near-record advance of $7.1 million, and AOL Time Warner plans to spend $1 million more on a barrage of promotions, including many involving AOL Time Warner's other businesses, like the magazines Time and Fortune, the America Online service and CNN.
2001-06-10	Private Sector; Blunt Words From One Who's Done It Before	They spent two years poring over case studies and slogging through ''Financial Reporting and Control,'' but Harvard's nearly 1,000 newly minted M.B.A.'s may best remember the salty bon mots from John F. Welch Jr., the departing chairman of General Electric. ''Remember the things you did that you wished you didn't do,'' Mr. Welch, 65, told the graduates at their ceremony last Wednesday. ''Leave all that stuff here. You can take the world by the tail, as long as you're not a jerk.''
2001-06-09	World Business Briefing | Europe: European Union: G.E. Meeting Delayed	The scheduled meeting between the General Electric chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., and the European competition commissioner, Mario Monti, has been deferred, the company said. Mr. Welch is in Brussels with a team of lawyers representing G.E. and Honeywell International to negotiate regulatory approval of their $41 billion merger. G.E. has until the middle of next week to deal with European regulators' objections to the deal. Unless G.E. abandons the deal, a final ruling will be made at the weekly meeting of European commissioners on July 4 or July 11. Paul Meller (NYT)
2001-06-08	In Europe, Aircraft Unit Hampers G.E. Deal	As General Electric and European regulators enter a final round of meetings over the proposed acquisition of Honeywell International, the chief obstacle to approval of the deal appears to be G.E.'s aircraft-leasing division. John F. Welch Jr., the chief executive of General Electric, will meet on Friday with Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, in an effort to win approval for the $45 billion deal, which has already been cleared by the United States Justice Department. The European Commission must rule by July 12.
2001-05-30	G.E. Defends Deal to European Panel	The General Electric Company and Honeywell International Inc. presented their case to European regulators for approval of their planned $40 billion aerospace merger today in a hearing that is the beginning of the end for the deal's clearance. G.E. and the European Commission, which is leading the investigation, declined to discuss details of the first day of the hearing. But people close to the commission said that G.E.'s economists questioned the European regulators' definitions of some of the markets affected by the deal. ''It is quite normal for companies to go into the hearings by dismissing all the commission's objections,'' one person said. ''The real negotiating doesn't begin until after the hearings are over.''
2001-05-18	G.E. CHIEF SAYS HE IS SURPRISED BY SCRUTINY OF A DEAL	John F. Welch Jr., the chief executive of General Electric, said yesterday that he was surprised by the level of scrutiny that European regulators gave to G.E.'s proposed $43 billion acquisition of Honeywell International. He said, though, that he was willing to take steps to assuage their concerns. Mr. Welch, in an interview, said that G.E. would agree not to bundle aircraft engines and avionics in packages that its competitors could not match.
2001-05-15	G.E. GETS EXTENSION OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CONTRACT	The General Electric Company won a five-year extension of an upgrade and maintenance contract with the Southwest Airlines Company valued at $1.2 billion. The service unit of GE Aircraft Engines will install upgrade kits on 300 CFM56-3 engines, used on older-model Boeing 737's and made by a joint venture between General Electric and Snecma of France, a General Electric spokeswoman, Jamie Jewell, said. G.E. Engine Services will maintain the Southwest fleet through 2012. GE Aircraft Engines is based in Evendale, Ohio.
2001-05-14	NBC Ponders Its Options: Grow or Else	In the distant broadcasting past, back in 1941, NBC was considered such a big and dominant broadcaster that Federal regulators broke it up. Part of it eventually became ABC. Sixty years later, NBC is posed with the opposite threat -- it is now competing in a world where it has been so greatly diminished next to media giants like AOL Time Warner and Viacom that its future vitality is widely considered to be in peril.
2001-05-11	Next Chairman At G.E. Makes First Changes	In his first major corporate and personnel moves since becoming president and chairman-elect of the General Electric Company, Jeffrey R. Immelt said yesterday that he had named Gary L. Rogers, head of GE Plastics, as a corporate vice chairman and had split G.E.'s plastics business into two operations. The divisions will be GE Plastics, which will serve primarily industrial customers, and GE Specialty Materials, which will sell abrasives, silicones and other products used in semiconductor and other technologically advanced industries.
2001-05-10	G.E. PROJECTS BIGGER SAVINGS FROM HONEYWELL	Profit at General Electric this year will be at the upper end of its projections, and the company probably will save more from the planned purchase of Honeywell International Inc. than forecast, G.E.'s president, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said yesterday. Mr. Immelt said G.E. would have profit ''solidly above'' $1.45 a share. The company initially forecast a range of $1.40 to $1.50. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call project a profit of $1.47 a share. Mr. Immelt spoke in Florida at a conference sponsored by a group of equity analysts called the Electrical Products Group. He also gave details about the business combinations of the Honeywell acquisition, which will merge products and services in aerospace, industrial controls, chemicals and power systems. That transaction has been tentatively approved by the Justice Department and is being reviewed by European regulators.
2001-05-09	Europe Plans Full Inquiry On G.E.-Honeywell Deal	Resisting pressure to cut it short, the European Commission will carry to completion its investigation of the General Electric Company's planned acquisition of Honeywell International, the commission confirmed today. If it wins approval, the $45 billion deal would combine G.E.'s dominant position in the global aircraft-engine market with Honeywell's strength in avionics and other aircraft components.

2001-04-17	PCB Worries Are Spreading From Hudson To Its Shores	For 25 years, environmental groups and state officials have concentrated on the problems posed by toxic PCB's in the Hudson River, but now they are starting to focus on dozens of contaminated spots in landfills and backyards in the upper Hudson Valley. More than six times as many PCB's were dumped on land as in the river, according to two separate investigations conducted by environmental groups and based on state records. Although the chemicals are not as dangerous on land as they are in the river, where they become concentrated in fish and river sediment, they are seeping into groundwater in a number of places, and may be leaking into the Hudson in a few, according to state officials.
2001-04-13	G.E.'s Operating Earnings Rise 16%, Despite Slow Economy	The General Electric Company, buoyed by strong sales of gas turbines and medical systems, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose 16 percent compared with results in the period a year earlier. The profit from operations, which matched analysts' estimates, was $3.02 billion, or 30 cents a share, up from $2.59 billion, or 26 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose less than 2 percent, to $30.49 billion.
2001-04-11	At Title-Happy Companies, It's a Chief Per Bottle Washer	Time was, being the chief executive meant one thing: you were the boss, the first among unequals, the person who stopped the buck; you were the ''capo di capi,'' in the words of Geoff Unwin, global chief executive of Cap Gemini Ernst & Young. Now, many large companies have several chief executives -- one for each division, perhaps, or maybe one for each continent.
2001-04-06	NBC President Lobbies City To Block G.E. Dredging Bill	The General Electric Corporation's battle against a federally required, half-billion-dollar cleanup of the Hudson River in upstate New York has extended into City Hall, with the visit of the president of the company's NBC television network to lobby personally against the plan. The president, Robert C. Wright, the top executive at NBC and vice chairman of the General Electric corporate board, led a five-member group that met privately last week with City Council members and their assistants to argue against a bill that endorses the dredging project.
2001-03-31	GE CAPITAL AGREES TO BUY FRANCHISE FINANCE	The GE Capital Corporation agreed to buy the Franchise Finance Corporation of America for $1.4 billion in cash, expanding its lending to Burger King, 7-Eleven, Midas Muffler and other franchises. GE Capital, the world's biggest nonbank financing company, will pay $25 cash per Franchise Finance share, 5.4 percent more than Thursday's $23.72 closing price. GE Capital will also assume $700 million of debt. Franchise Finance, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., has provided loans and other credit to 6,200 properties in the United States and Canada. It will operate as a separate unit within GE Capital's Commercial Equipment Financing subsidiary.
2001-03-27	G.E. Near Deal to Sell Unit To European Satellite Group	The General Electric Company is close to selling its satellite services unit to the Société Européenne des Satellites of Luxembourg for about $5 billion in cash and stock, according to executives close to the deal. The companies, which have been holding talks for months, have tentatively reached an agreement and an announcement could come within a week, the executives said last night. However, they warned that both sides could still abandon the deal.
2001-03-26	A New Kind of Software Company for India	At a time when the term start-up evokes images of crashing stock prices and collapsing business plans -- here as much as in the United States -- Ashok Soota might not seem to be a man to watch. But Mr. Soota's 19-month-old venture, Mind Tree Consulting, has been celebrated by technology analysts and journalists, even though it is privately held and has all of $15 million in sales.
2001-03-19	General Electric's Evaluation Process	General Electric, a company whose management techniques are closely followed, has long evaluated its managerial and professional employees on a curve. Its review process is detailed. ''We really try our damndest to be a meritocracy,'' said William J. Conaty, senior vice president for corporate human resources.
2001-03-19	Companies Turn to Grades, And Employees Go to Court	An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies. At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone.
2001-03-18	FIVE QUESTIONS for JOHN F. WELCH JR.; Dominate Markets, But Cast a Wide Net	MORE than 15 years ago, John F. Welch Jr., the General Electric Company's chairman, came up with a then-radical idea: If you don't have a shot at being No. 1 or No. 2 in your business, get out. It was the reason he sold G.E.'s mining and housewares businesses and strengthened its financial businesses. And it helped turn G.E. into a profit powerhouse.
2001-03-14	G.E. SAYS PROFITS WILL INCREASE AT LEAST 10% THIS YEAR	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its profit would rise in 2001 by at least 10 percent and that the savings from its planned purchase of Honeywell International would be greater than previously estimated. The company said its earnings were ensured by an order backlog of more than $44 billion in turbines, aircraft engines and other expensive equipment that is financed and serviced over years. Shares of General Electric rose $2.73, to $42.33 a share. The company said it expected to meet analysts' first-quarter per-share profit estimates of 30 cents, the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.
2001-03-04	Gipper Meets 'Survivor' As G.E.'s Image Hardens; PCB Battle Tests a Venerable Tradition	One of the more upbeat theories of postmodern capitalism is that nice companies will eventually finish first. In a market of instant information, where perception and image are increasingly linked to stock prices, investors will reward the environmentally green and the socially conscious because such companies have fewer potential liabilities, or so the thinking goes. But the nice-guy theory is getting a major test in upstate New York, where General Electric is waging a vehement, line-in-the-sand battle against dredging the Hudson River to remove the PCB's that its factories leaked or dumped into the water in the decades after World War II.
2001-02-28	Europe Sets Examination Of G.E. Deal	The European Commission confirmed today that it would open an extended investigation into the General Electric Company's planned $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International Inc., despite an 11th-hour effort by John F. Welch Jr., the G.E. chief executive, to secure a quick clearance by European regulators. ''I informed Jack Welch of my intention to open a second-phase inquiry,'' Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said in reference to his meeting with Mr. Welch in Brussels on Monday.
2001-02-25	Shatter-Proofing The Light Bulb	WORRIED about light bulbs that break and scatter their glass dangerously? A new line of shatter-resistant incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs, the Saf-T-Guard by General Electric, will be available in stores next month. ''With safety being such an important topic on consumers' minds right now,'' said Ken Damato, the general manager for consumer marketing who adapted the product for consumer use, ''we thought this new product really made sense.''
2001-02-19	Media Marriage of Convenience Yields Best Seller	In 1966, the NBC television network broke new ground in the marketing of both recorded music and television programming with the appearance of ''The Monkees'' -- a made-for-TV band that also sold its own records. Now NBC and HarperCollins Publishers are trying something similar with a book, and it is working like a charm. In a rare collaboration by a network and a publisher, NBC wove the publication of a book into the plot of its soap ''Passions,'' including an on-screen appearance of HarperCollins's chief executive, Jane Friedman. Meanwhile, off screen, HarperCollins last month published a new book ostensibly written by a character on ''Passions.'' The result, titled ''Hidden Passions,'' has become a national best seller, appearing on The New York Times best-seller list for the first time last week, with more than 120,000 copies in print.
2001-02-07	EXECUTIVE IS PROMOTED TO CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF AT CNBC	General Electric said yesterday that it had promoted the president of its CNBC financial news channel to the newly created position of chairman and chief executive of the unit. The executive, Bill Bolster, 57, had been president of CNBC since January 1996. Previously, Mr. Bolster was president and general manager of WNBC-TV, NBC's flagship TV station in New York. General Electric also announced the promotion of Pamela Thomas-Graham to president and chief operating officer of CNBC.
2001-01-25	Cold Comfort Comes In an iMac Rainbow	When it came to the new color palette for General Electric's compact refrigerators, introduced this month at the International Housewares Show in Chicago, the company decided to be a copycat. ''We talked to a lot of students, who said they'd like colors to match their electronics -- like blueberry, grape, tangerine, kiwi green and cherry red,'' said Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for G.E., in Louisville, Ky. ''We have matched it to the iMac,'' she added. The color versions, below, are cubes, 19 inches on a side, to be available in June for $89. Inside, they are 1.8 cubic feet, with a small freezer. And, hey, you traditionalists: the cube is available now in black and white.
2001-01-18	With Income Up 16%, G.E. Warns of Layoffs	General Electric, balancing a softening in sales with a ratcheting up of productivity, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 16 percent even though revenue gained only 6 percent. But the company also said layoffs were likely. G.E. earned $3.59 billion, or 36 cents a share in the quarter, compared with $3.09 billion, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $35 billion from $32.9 billion.
2001-01-16	Experts Look to Old Mill for Answers to Pollution of Hudson	For decades, the crumbling limestone walls of the old Allen Mill concealed a secret. Deep inside, a 150-year-old tunnel and a long-forgotten wooden gate that were part of the mill's early Industrial Era water-power system on the upper Hudson River were slowly rotting away into the earth. Finally, in 1991, the gate failed. A reservoir that had built up in the tunnel -- a foul stew of PCB's, solvents and oils that had seeped through the porous shale bedrock from the General Electric capacitor factory just up the riverbank -- surged into the Hudson.
2001-01-10	RELATIVES OF 3 CONCORDE CRASH VICTIMS FILE SUIT	Air France, Continental Airlines, and the companies that helped build their aircraft have been named in a new lawsuit stemming from last year's crash of a Concorde supersonic jet. The complaint, filed yesterday by the estates of three German travelers who died in the crash, contends that two events thought to have caused the crash -- a 16-inch metal strip falling off a Continental DC-10's thrust reverser, and the blowout of a Concorde tire that hit the strip on the runway -- were such common occurrences that the crash could and should have been prevented. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, General Electric, MRA Systems Inc., BAE Systems P.L.C. and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, are named as defendants in the suit.
2001-01-05	To Dredge or Not to Dredge? PCB Study Is Neutral	A long-awaited study released yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences about PCB pollution and the various strategies for cleaning it up does not endorse a plan by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to dredge the Hudson River. But neither does it reject the proposal.
2000-12-29	Montgomery Ward to Close Its Doors	Montgomery Ward & Company, once the greatest American retailer and the pioneer of many sales practices that became widely accepted, said yesterday that it would go out of business after 128 years. The company, owned by General Electric, said it would close its 250 stores and dismiss the 28,000 associates who run them in the coming months. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection yesterday for a second and final time and eliminated 450 national jobs immediately. The company is based in Chicago and now operates in 30 states. The stores closest to New York City are in Poughkeepsie and Kingston.
2000-12-18	No Rest at G.E.	Who says that old, big companies are static by definition? General Electric -- around for 120 years, with sales that topped $111 billion last year -- saw as much change in 2000 as any new-economy player. For one thing, it got a whole lot bigger by snatching up Honeywell International out from under United Technologies. And John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s forceful leader, annointed Jeffrey R. Immelt, the head of GE Medical Systems, his successor, a change expected at the end of 2001. Mr. Immelt declined to say how his reign might differ from Mr. Welch's, but he did say it will be the same in one major way: ''Jack drove change, and I will drive change.''
2000-12-14	G.E. Offers Repairs on Defective Dishwashers	After several months of negotiation, General Electric has agreed to offer free repairs by a G.E. technician to all consumers affected by a recall of defective dishwashers begun in October 1999, according to a statement that the Consumer Product Safety Commission plans to issue today. The 3.1 million G.E. and Hotpoint dishwashers, produced from April 1983 to January 1989, had a defective air-drying switch with the potential to melt or ignite, creating a fire hazard. There had been 80 hazardous incidents with no injuries before the recall, and 10 after it.
2000-12-13	At Hearing, Hudson Cleanup Suddenly Becomes Personal	The scientists, the bureaucrats and the corporate executives have all had their say about the Hudson River and its toxic PCB troubles. But tonight, for about 20 students in the 9th and 10th grades at Mohonasen High School in Rotterdam, what had been a mostly academic debate over the river became local and personal and real. The students, who have been studying the river and its pollution in biology class at their school, just outside Albany, were among more than 1,100 people crowded into a downtown ballroom on a frigid night for the first public hearing on a plan to clean up the Hudson. For two months, the federal Environmental Protection Agency will try to gauge local feeling in the Hudson River Valley about a plan to make General Electric dredge the river to remove the pollutants embedded in its sediment.
2000-12-13	G.E. TO TAKE $4 BILLION CHARGE FOR HONEYWELL	General Electric said yesterday that it would take $4 billion in pretax charges for the purchase of Honeywell International and raised its estimated annual savings from the acquisition by two-thirds, to $2.5 billion. Honeywell also reiterated that its fourth-quarter profit would be below forecasts. The company said it would take as much as $425 million in pretax charges in the period, partly because of a decision to cancel the sale of some units after the $45 billion deal with G.E. was made. The revisions come less than two months after John F. Welch Jr., the chief executive of G.E., broke up a merger between Honeywell and the United Technologies Corporation. Mr. Welch said at the time that the addition of Honeywell would be too good to pass up, and he forecast $1.5 billion in annual savings. The purchase will add 11 cents a share to profit in the first year, and 17 cents in the third year after the acquisition is completed, even if there is no growth at the Honeywell businesses, Mr. Welch said on a conference call. Shares of G.E. fell after Honeywell's warning, closing at $52.81, down $2.50.
2000-12-12	Dredging the Hudson	To the Editor: Re ''G.E. Facing Order to Remove Poisons From the Hudson'' (front page, Dec. 6): The Environmental Protection Agency's order to have General Electric dredge the Hudson River could cost the company $1 billion, and some local residents fear that dredging could recontaminate the river with stirred-up chemicals.
2000-12-11	Efficiencies Found Online Help Companies Build Profits Offline	The dot-coms may get the publicity. But John F. Welch Jr. is certain that companies like General Electric will reap the profits. ''The Internet was made for big companies,'' said Mr. Welch, G.E.'s chairman and Web-champion-in-chief. ''The dot-coms understand buying and selling. But the real efficiencies come in that middle part of the equation: making things.''
2000-12-10	Nice Bounty For Two Big Heads	When Jack Welch finally anointed a successor on Nov. 27, people at General Electric were not the only ones to sigh in relief. ''By then I didn't have any fingernails left,'' said Gerard R. Roche, senior chairman of Heidrick & Struggles International, the executive recruiters. Far more than his nails were at stake. For months, Mr. Roche had been on retainer to find new leaders for both 3M and Home Depot. His firm stood to make a flat fee of more than $1 million for each search. At least 20 percent of the take would go to Mr. Roche, and probably, considering his seniority, a lot more.
2000-12-08	Plausible Plan for the Hudson	The 10-year battle between the federal government and the General Electric Company over cleaning up the Hudson River reached a major turning point Wednesday when the Environmental Protection Agency ordered the company to spend a half-billion dollars over five years to dredge toxic PCB's embedded in the river bottom north of Albany. The company will fight the plan during the mandatory 60-day comment period that lies ahead, and it is theoretically possible that a new administration in Washington could amend or delay it. But as G.E. must now realize, the dynamics of this long and complicated struggle have now shifted dramatically against it. Not only has the country's most important environmental agency come down on the side of dredging, after 10 years of study and equivocation, but the administration of Gov. George Pataki of New York has endorsed the same strategy. With responsible officials from two levels of government and both political parties calling for a cleanup, it will be hard for G.E. to assert that it is a victim of environmentalism run amok. The company is entitled to challenge the science behind the E.P.A.'s proposal before it takes effect, as it has before. But if its arguments prove unpersuasive, the company might be wise to join Albany and Washington in a comprehensive attack on the last big obstacle to the restoration of one of America's great rivers.
2000-12-07	Fight Just Beginning on Hudson Cleanup	It isn't over. Although the half-billion-dollar plan by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to dredge the Hudson River in upstate New York was presented yesterday as the long-sought answer to the river's troubles with toxic PCB's, experts on both sides of the issue say the real showdown is only now about to begin.
2000-12-07	Dredging River's PCB's Could Be a Cure Worse Than the Disease, G.E. Insists	The debate over digging up the Hudson River's last industrial stain has always centered on a single question: Is the cure worse than the disease? And the answer offered by a variety of experts on underwater toxic cleanups remains a resounding: It depends. They say that new dredging technologies can effectively attack buried spots of PCB's and, if used carefully, can keep contaminated silt from spreading and creating new problems.
2000-12-06	Home Depot Names Officer From G.E. As President	Moving quickly to sign up the remaining also-ran in the race to succeed John F. Welch Jr. at General Electric, Home Depot Inc. announced yesterday that it had named Robert L. Nardelli as president and chief executive. Mr. Nardelli, 52, is president and chief executive of GE Power Systems, a $15 billion division. His appointment at Home Depot is effective immediately.
2000-12-06	G.E. FACING ORDER TO REMOVE POISONS FROM THE HUDSON	The Environmental Protection Agency, in what would be the most ambitious river cleanup in the nation's history, plans to order the General Electric Company to spend a half-billion dollars to dredge toxic PCB's embedded in the mud beneath the Hudson River. The federal plan, which is to be formally announced today in New York, is a major defeat for G.E., which owned the factories north of Albany that legally dumped the chemicals in the river over a 30-year period. The company will have to bear the cost of the cleanup if the proposal becomes a formal order next year.
2000-12-05	G.E. and the Hudson	To the Editor: Re ''On Hudson, Cleanup Idea Stirs Emotions'' (front page, Dec. 2): It is clear that the General Electric Company owes a debt to the Hudson River, but it isn't so clear that trying to dredge every last bit of PCB's in the river is the most effective way to repay it.
2000-12-04	Corrections	Picture credits were reversed in Business Day on Wednesday with an article about the management style of John F. Welch Jr., chief executive of General Electric. The photograph of Mr. Welch with the G.E. logo was by Agence France-Presse; the other photograph of him was by Mark Peterson/Saba.
2000-12-02	On Hudson, Cleanup Idea Stirs Emotions	Michael McLoughlin is a celebrity. Mr. McLoughlin, a 43-year-old lumberyard salesman, had a brief appearance in a recent General Electric television advertisement about the Hudson River and why the company should not be forced to dredge the bottom to remove PCB's it put there. The river is cleaning itself naturally, the ads all say, and Mr. McLoughlin agrees. Off camera, Mr. McLoughlin's feelings about General Electric and the river are more complicated. He has a cousin who is suing G.E. for $6 million, charging that PCB's contributed to her husband's death from a rare blood disease. But like many people along this stretch of the upper Hudson just south of G.E.'s old factories, Mr. McLoughlin knows things have gotten better. He well remembers the period during his childhood in the 1960's and 1970's when the river was so fouled he had to paw through the matted scum of its surface to go for a swim.
2000-12-01	G.E.'s New Corporate Face; Jeffrey Immelt Rides a Can-Do Confidence to the Top	Earlier this year, GE Medical Systems lost out on a multimillion-dollar deal to provide diagnostic equipment to a big hospital. The sales staff sadly accepted the loss; Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, refused to. ''He simply said, 'We cannot let this happen,' '' recalled Beth E. Klein, a vice president of Gems, as the unit is usually called.
2000-11-29	Metro Business Briefing; G.E. SUES OVER SUPERFUND LAW	General Electric Company filed a lawsuit yesterday asking that provisions of the federal Superfund toxic waste cleanup law be declared invalid. G.E. is arguing that the Superfund's provisions give the Environmental Protection Agency ''uncontrolled authority to order intrusive remedial projects of unlimited scope and duration in nonemergency situations.'' The company is battling with environmentalists and regulators over the cleanup of the upper Hudson River, where the company discharged polycholorinated biphenyls decades ago. Environmentalists and the Pataki administration want the company to dredge the river, which could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to make a decision on the dredging in the next few weeks.
2000-11-28	It Will Be Difficult to Match Welch's Record	The years that John F. Welch Jr. ran General Electric were phenomenal in many ways: earnings soared and the stock price went up even more. The company went from being highly regarded to being viewed as perhaps the best-managed company in the world. Investors have good reason to be grateful to Mr. Welch. From April 22, 1981, the day Mr. Welch took command at G.E., through yesterday, an investment in General Electric common stock rose 6,220 percent -- or 23.5 percent a year -- assuming reinvestment of all dividends and ignoring taxes and transaction costs.
2000-11-28	G.E. Taps Successor to the Chief	Ending more than a year of handicapping, General Electric selected Jeffrey R. Immelt yesterday to succeed John F. Welch Jr., one of the world's most imitated business leaders, as chairman and chief executive when Mr. Welch retires at the end of next year. Although the baton will not formally pass for a year, Mr. Immelt, the 44-year-old head of GE Medical Systems, has been named president and chairman-elect of G.E. itself. The two men said yesterday that Mr. Immelt would immediately take a significant role in running G.E., which management experts have regarded as the model American corporation for more than a decade.
2000-11-28	Filling Big Shoes? Better Tie Laces Tight	The toughest job in American business is to succeed a highly successful chief executive. For Jeffrey R. Immelt, who was named the next chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company yesterday, that task will be even harder, as he will follow John F. Welch Jr., who has led G.E. for nearly two decades and built it into the most highly valued corporation in the nation.
2000-11-28	Success Built On Selling Imaging Gear	Jeffrey R. Immelt, the next chief executive of General Electric, made his mark at GE Medical Systems by building up sales of imaging machines, a big-ticket, older technology. Hospital consultants said that by offering services, including financing, to customers, he breathed new life into a mature technology. With help from the G.E. financial services unit, Mr. Immelt offered million-dollar scanners on terms that attracted cash-short hospitals.
2000-11-19	Even His Souffles Can't Relax	In the summer of 1999, George David and his 50-foot sailboat, Idler, led a United States team in competition for the Admiral's Cup. He expected to win. He came in third in his class. Was he mad? Distraught? Disheartened, at least? ''I was disappointed,'' was as far as Mr. David would go.
2000-11-17	Pataki Administration Calls for Dredging of the Hudson River to Clean Up PCB's	Entering one of the hottest environmental debates in the state, the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki has for the first time called for the dredging of the Hudson River to remove potentially harmful PCB's. For years, the state has been questioning whether more should be done at the bottom of the river, where an estimated one million pounds of PCB's remain.
2000-11-14	G.E. to Invest $11 Million in UConn Partnership	The University of Connecticut and General Electric are forming a partnership that will allow engineering and business students and faculty members to work with G.E. executives to develop advanced computer and Internet-based products, university and company officials said today. UConn officials said the partnership, underwritten with $11 million in grants and donations from G.E., would offer students a technologically advanced environment and curriculum to learn the latest business and engineering methods and, it is hoped, to create new ones of their own. Executives of G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., said the project would give the company a forum to test new technologies and a ready pipeline to UConn's best and brightest students.
2000-11-10	Along the Hudson, Vigils Supporting a River Cleanup	Cupping candles in the gusty night wind, several hundred people attended vigils last night at dozens of sites along the Hudson River from Manhattan to upstate Hudson Falls to show their support for a cleanup of toxic PCB's in the river. The vigils were organized by two environmental groups, Scenic Hudson and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, to counter an advertising campaign by General Electric, which released the PCB's.
2000-10-31	G.E. and the PCB's	To the Editor: General Electric's takeover of Honeywell International (Week in Review, Oct. 29) is an amazing tribute to the talents of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch. The overnight acquisition of Honeywell, a $45 billion company, stands in stark contrast to the 20-year battle to remove the million pounds of toxic PCB's that G.E. dumped into the Hudson River.
2000-10-24	Chase Manhattan Gets Lift From G.E.-Honeywell Deal	For a passing moment during his presentation of General Electric's $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International yesterday, John F. Welch Jr. interrupted himself to tip his hat to one of the men behind his biggest deal ever: his banker, Geoff Boisi, the head of investment banking at Chase Manhattan and the soon-to-be co-chief executive of J. P. Morgan investment banking. Being mentioned by one of America's most legendary executives was undoubtedly gratifying for Mr. Boisi, but it was probably even more rewarding for his bosses at Chase, which spent about $450 million last spring to buy Mr. Boisi's advisory boutique, the Beacon Group. By all measures, Mr. Boisi did not come cheap. The cost of that acquisition, as well as Chase's purchase of Robert Fleming, a London-based investment bank, helped Chase's investment banking expenses balloon 47 percent in the third quarter.
2000-10-24	Corrections	A headline on the continuation of a front-page article yesterday about the purchase of Honeywell International by General Electric misstated the price in some copies. It is $45 billion, not $45 million.
2000-10-24	Within G.E.'s Vocabulary, The Honeywell Deal Scans	Michael R. Bonsignore, the chief executive of Honeywell International, and John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chief, sat side by side yesterday on the stage in an NBC studio in the G.E. building in Rockefeller Center. They both looked tired, but only Mr. Welch looked exhilarated. The occasion, of course, was the official announcement of the news that had splashed across front pages and Web sites nationwide: General Electric was buying Honeywell in a stock deal worth $45 billion.
2000-10-24	Technology-Rich Morris County Shrugging Off Mergers	In the last year or so, three companies based in Morris County have announced they were merging with bigger companies and closing at least part of their operations here. Now it is happening again. The General Electric Company agreed Sunday to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer that is based here. As part of the agreement, Honeywell will close its 550-employee headquarters here, although it will keep 1,750 workers in various businesses and laboratories here in place for now.
2000-10-24	Did G.E. Just Purchase Boeing Without Boeing Knowing It?	The General Electric Company's proposed $45 billion purchase of Honeywell International has been widely promoted as the last hurrah of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr. But it may ultimately be remembered for cementing a dominant position for G.E. in the global aviation business. G.E. is already one of the major manufacturers of passenger jet engines and its finance division leases hundreds of airplanes to the world's airlines. Honeywell's $10.5 billion portfolio of aerospace businesses will double aviation-related revenue at G.E., raising it to nearly 15 percent of the $130 billion overall sales of the combined companies.
2000-10-23	GENERAL ELECTRIC BUYING HONEYWELL IN $45 BILLION DEAL	The General Electric Company has agreed to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer, for $45 billion in stock, capping several intense rounds of deal making that broke up an impending merger between United Technologies and Honeywell. As part of the agreement, John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, will defer his planned retirement from April until the end of 2001 to see the deal through and manage his company's largest acquisition. G.E. expects the transaction to be completed by early next year.
2000-10-21	Offer From G.E. Breaks Up $40 Billion Deal for Honeywell	A counteroffer from General Electric's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., broke up United Technologies' deal to buy Honeywell International yesterday, setting off a rush of activity as other suitors considered bidding for all or part of Honeywell. Siemens A.G. of Germany, for one, is weighing its options, according to executives close to the company. And, while the acquisition-minded Tyco International denied that it planned to bid for Honeywell, executives close to Tyco said it might bid on the parts of Honeywell that G.E. or another suitor might not want.
2000-10-20	Study Finds That Many Large Companies Pay No Taxes	Goodyear, Texaco, Colgate-Palmolive, MCI WorldCom and eight other large corporations earned more than $12.2 billion in profits in 1996 through 1998, but none of them ended up owing corporate income taxes over that period, according to a study released yesterday. Indeed, as a group, the companies received $535 million in credits or refunds, the report found. The study of 250 large publicly traded companies showed that 24 owed no tax or received credits against past or future tax obligations in 1998, up from 13 in 1997 and 16 in 1996. The study also found that 71 of the 250 companies paid taxes at less than half the official 35 percent corporate rate during the three-year period.
2000-10-12	G.E. Meets Forecast With 20% Rise in Net	The General Electric Company, apparently immune to the weak euro and the softening economy, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, meeting analysts' estimates. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income rose to $3.18 billion, or 32 cents a share, compared with $2.65 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier when adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split. Revenue increased 18 percent, to $32 billion from $27.2 billion.
2000-10-06	Speaking in Bar Code; Personal Scanners Link Products Directly to Consumers	Most shoppers at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square who listen to cuts of, say, Macy Gray's new album, ''On How Life Is,'' essentially have two choices if they want to buy it: purchase the CD there for $17.99 or walk out and search elsewhere. But up-to-the-minute shoppers equipped with Verizon cellular phones capable of connecting to the Internet have another option. They can click on the icon for BarPoint.com Inc., an Internet database service, and punch in the CD's bar code. Those digits, unique to each product, can now be used as a shortcut to find a range of product-specific information: other CD's by the artists, for example, snippets of reviews, or exactly how much it costs at online stores. Later this year, BarPoint.com promises to list prices from the music store down the street as well.
2000-09-30	G.E. Switches Its Web Site About PCB's	Three letters. On the surface, that's the only difference between Hudsonwatch.com and Hudson watch.net -- two Web sites devoted to the subject of the General Electric Company and the controversy over PCB pollution in the Hudson River. But appearances are deceiving. The dot-com site, run by General Electric for the last several years, is stocked with scientific reports and glossy pictures that are part of the company's multimillion-dollar campaign to convince people that dredging the Hudson to remove PCB's is neither necessary nor wise.
2000-09-26	Judge Dismisses State Suit Over Pollution of Hudson	A lawsuit filed by New York State's attorney general against General Electric last year arguing that the company should be held liable for the economic costs of pollution in the Hudson River has been dismissed by an Albany judge, who called it ''premature'' and ''meritless.'' Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer refused to admit defeat, however, and said the lawsuit's central argument would be revived in another suit.
2000-09-25	Compressed Data; In Time for Fall Season, NBCi Piles On the Features	Maybe it is because they are used to a new season in the fall. But the Internet services that are tied to big television networks seem to be picking this month to showcase new versions of their sites. Two weeks ago, Walt Disney's Go.com, which incorporates sites related to its ABC and ESPN networks, introduced a complete redesign. And today, NBC Internet, a company partly owned by General Electric's NBC network, will introduce its new flagship NBCi.com. The site brings together under one name the features from a jumble of brands the company built and bought, including Snap, Xoom and NBC.com. (The MSNBC news site and the CNBC financial news site are separate.)
2000-09-24	Diversity and G.E.	To the Editor: While G.E. may not have met diversity goals for high-ranking officers, it is behind a program that delivers incredible opportunities for a new generation of prospective university faculty members.
2000-09-24	Diversity and G.E.	To the Editor: ''Where G.E. Falls Short: Diversity at the Top'' (Sept. 3) left me shaking my head. While genuine diversity, in attributes and background, can be a real plus for a company, why should race or sex matter? Segregationists thought people were defined by race, but didn't sensible people know better?
2000-09-16	SCOTTISH LIFE TALKS COLLAPSE	Merger negotiations between GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric, and Scottish Life, an Edinburgh-based mutual life insurance company, have been abandoned, people close to the negotiations said. GE Capital had been near a deal to buy Scottish Life for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion), but negotiations soured when new bidders emerged at the last minute, these people said. Scottish Life said that it had received proposals from interested parties, but declined to identify them. Likely candidates are Royal London Mutual Insurance Society Ltd. and Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)
2000-09-13	A Showdown On Cleanup Of the Hudson	With only three months left before the Environmental Protection Agency is to release a decision on the decades-old problem of PCB contamination in the Hudson River, a fight in Congress that some politicians and E.P.A. officials say could delay the ruling yet again -- perhaps into the next presidential administration -- is reaching a showdown. The House of Representatives passed a bill in June that would require the environmental agency to consider a study on the impact of dredging, now under way at the National Academy of Sciences, before authorizing any new dredging. The study, which is already running behind schedule, could push the E.P.A.'s ruling on the Hudson past the December deadline the agency had set, since it is considering dredging as a remedy.
2000-09-12	Ebersol Is the One Who Decides What Will Be Seen From Sydney	When the Olympics come to American television Friday, the maestro overseeing the five-hour nightly extravaganza will be Dick Ebersol. No sports television executive has held as much power in the Olympics as Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. No one has spent as much for the TV rights or is as close to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the embattled president of the International Olympic Committee.
2000-09-12	G.E. DEAL SEEN FOR SCOTTISH LIFE	The financial services arm of the General Electric Company, GE Capital, is close to announcing a deal worth $:1 billion, or about $1.42 billion, for Scottish Life Assurance, the mutual pension provider, people close to the situation said. Details of the deal are likely to be announced late in the week. GE Capital approached Edinburgh-based Scottish Life after it decided not to pursue a bid for Scottish Provident, another Edinburgh mutual life insurer that agreed last week to sell itself to Abbey National for $:1.8 billion. Scottish Life, with assets of $:9.7 billion, would give GE Capital a foothold in the British pension market. Suzanne Kapner
2000-09-03	Where G.E. Falls Short: Diversity at the Top	IN a few months, John F. Welch will step down as chief executive of the General Electric Company, leaving behind a remarkable 20-year run of earnings growth and near cultlike devotion. And the three front-runners to succeed this 20th-century business icon fit a pattern. All are gung-ho results-getters for the company -- and all are white men. In June, G.E. promoted three more executives who stand ready to replace any front-runner who bails out if he is not anointed as Mr. Welch's successor. These three, too, fit the mold: stellar growth-and-earnings producers, and all white men.
2000-08-30	HARMON INDUSTRIES ACCEPTS GENERAL ELECTRIC OFFER	Harmon Industries , a maker of train-highway crossing signals, accepted a $386 million acquisition offer from the General Electric Company. Harmon, of Blue Springs, Mo., will become part of GE Harris Railway Electronics, a joint venture between GE Transportation Systems, based in Erie, Pa., and the Harris Corporation, a communications equipment maker in Melbourne, Fla., GE Transportation said. Under the deal, Harmon shareholders would receive 0.527 G.E. share for each Harmon share, or about $31.62 a share, based on G.E.'s Monday closing price of $60 a share. GE Transportation said 93.2 percent of Harmon's shareholders had accepted its offer, which expired on Monday. Originally, G.E., of Fairfield, Conn., offered to exchange 0.542 share for each Harmon share. Shares of Harmon , which had $304.4 million in revenue last year, traded at $31.25 each, down 31 cents.
2000-08-27	G.E. Plans to Leave Westchester Airport	Saying its quarters at Westchester County Airport in Harrison are too small for its corporate fleet of aircraft, the General Electric Company plans to lease about 11 acres at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, Jeff DeMarrais, a spokesman for the company, said. G.E.'s plan is to sublease the hangar it occupies in Harrison and build a $24 million, 95,000-square-foot-complex in Newburgh. The move would represent a loss of 80 jobs for Westchester.

The Lockheed Martin Corporation said it had selected General Electric to provide engines for an updated version of its Galaxy transport aircraft for the Air Force, a contract that could be valued at up to $2.6 billion. Lockheed, the world's largest military contractor, expects to be awarded the work by the Air Force in the first quarter of 2001. The contract calls for General Electric to supply 504 jet engines and spare parts over 10 years.
2000-07-29	President of NBC Gets the Added Title of Vice Chairman of G.E.	The General Electric Company named Robert C. Wright, the longtime president of NBC, to the additional post of vice chairman of G.E. yesterday. He will join the chairman, John F. Welch Jr., and one other vice chairman, Dennis D. Dammerman, a financial officer, as the only G.E. executives on the company's board. Mr. Wright, who has led NBC for 14 years, the longest tenure for any top executive in network television history, will continue to manage the network and all of its other media assets, which include the cable channels CNBC and MSNBC.
2000-07-25	Boeing and Airbus Disclose Over $15 Billion in Orders	The Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie announced more than $15 billion in new orders today at the air show in Farnborough, an unexpectedly large sum that reflected the resilience of the commercial aircraft market. The value of the orders disclosed by the companies, the world's only two builders of large airliners, far exceeded the $9.4 billion total that was announced at the last major international air show, in Paris, a little more than a year ago.
2000-07-25	Corrections	The Making Books column on July 13 and an article in Business Day on July 14 about the $7.1 million book advance reportedly being paid to John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of the General Electric Company, referred to the precedents incompletely. (Similar references appeared in an Op-Ed page column on July 16, in the Media Talk column of Business Day on July 17 and in an editorial on July 20.) While the advance is apparently a single-book record for North American nonfiction rights, higher amounts have been paid for worldwide English rights. Pope John Paul II reportedly received an $8.5 million advance in 1994 for his book about Roman Catholicism in the modern era. The sale of Mr. Welch's worldwide English rights is expected to add millions to his North American advance.
2000-07-20	The Welch Mystique	When a magazine like Fortune or Forbes conducts a survey to determine who is the most admired businessman of the year, decade or even the century, Jack Welch of General Electric invariably finishes at or near the top of the list. In his 20 years as G.E.'s chief executive officer, Mr. Welch has generated enormous wealth not only for the company's stockholders but for hundreds of companies that do business with G.E. But is Mr. Welch worth $7.1 million as a writer? That is what Time Warner Trade Publishing has agreed to advance him for a book about his career, his business philosophy and whatever else Mr. Welch chooses to write about when he retires next year. It is the biggest advance in publishing history, exceeding the up-front money paid to Colin Powell and the pope. Paying off a $7.1 million advance will require North American hardcover sales of 1.6 million books. Only one or two titles a year sell more than a million copies. A recent best seller by Microsoft's Bill Gates sold about half a million. So this is a gamble, but to some publishing executives, not nearly the gamble it seems to be. The reason is that whatever Mr. Welch writes is going to be perceived as the bible of American business.
2000-07-17	A New Patron Saint Of Book Publishing	Last week, Time Warner Trade Publishing acquired a book proposal by John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric and one of the most widely admired businessmen, for a record advance of $7.1 million. That, however, is just the beginning of what the publisher offered. It also promised a record-breaking marketing campaign, capitalizing heavily on its ties to Time Warner's Internet, broadcasting and magazine businesses. ''This goes way beyond anything that we have ever done before,'' said Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of Time Warner Trade Publishing and himself an avid fan of Mr. Welch. Fifteen executives spent a full day preparing a 10-page, single-spaced marketing plan to show Mr. Welch. About a third of it was devoted to the Internet.
2000-07-14	Book Advance For G.E. Chief Is $7.1 Million	Time Warner Trade Publishing yesterday acquired the right to publish a book by John F. Welch Jr., the widely admired chairman of the General Electric Company, for a record advance of $7.1 million, more than advances paid for books by Gen. Colin L. Powell or the pope. Publishers involved in the bidding war said the high level of interest in the book reflected the growing obsession with business and the stock market. Americans are working more hours and, in an overheated job market, seeking more rewarding work, said Carolyn Reidy, president of the trade division at Simon & Schuster, one of the unsuccessful bidders. In the meantime, interest in saving for retirement has spread a new fascination with investing. The eye-popping sum also testified, they said, to a masterful sales job by Mr. Welch.
2000-07-14	Profit Rises 20% at G.E., Powered by Push Into Online Sales	The General Electric Company, benefiting from a robust economy and its aggressive push into selling products online, said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, beating analysts' estimates. For the quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $3.38 billion, or 34 cents a share. That compares with $2.82 billion, or 28 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier when adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split in April. Revenue surged 20 percent, to $32.9 billion from $27.4 billion.
2000-07-12	Swiss Bank Is Acquiring PaineWebber	For several years, Donald B. Marron has waved off questions about when he would relent and sell the PaineWebber Group, the fourth-largest United States brokerage firm and the biggest one that is not part of a financial services conglomerate. Now, Mr. Marron, the firm's longtime chairman and chief executive, appears to be waving a white towel in surrender. UBS A.G., a giant Swiss bank that was formerly called Union Bank of Switzerland, has offered to pay about $12 billion in cash and stock for PaineWebber, and the companies were expecting to announce an agreement today, according to executives close to the deal. Almost $1 billion of the purchase price will go into a bonus pool to retain crucial employees of PaineWebber, an executive said.
2000-07-12	Big Book Fee Is Expected for Head of G.E.	John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric and one of the most successful executives in business, is expected to become one of the highest paid authors as well. Several major New York publishers began bidding for the right to publish a book by Mr. Welch with John A. Byrne, a senior writer for Business Week. A deal for the right to publish the book in the United States could be announced as early as today, for an advance of more than $6.5 million, according to people involved in the bidding.
2000-06-13	General Electric Announces Latest Round of Promotions	The General Electric Company announced another round of promotions yesterday in preparation for the retirement next April of its chairman, John F. Welch Jr. The company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., and which had $112 billion in revenue last year, named Ronald R. Pressman to be chief executive of the GE Employers Reinsurance Corporation and be a senior vice president. John Krenicki Jr. moved up to chief executive of GE Transportation Systems and Tanya D. Fratto became vice president of GE Superabrasives and a corporate officer.

AND CISCO FORM JOINT INTERNET VENTURE	The General Electric Company and Cisco Systems announced yesterday that they would form a joint venture, called GE Cisco Industrial Networks, to help manufacturers use Internet technology to ease communications between their factories and their offices. The venture, which will be based in Charlottesville, Va., will be led by a G.E. executive. It will offer a mix of services, including assessing customers' existing data systems, designing new ones around Internet technology, providing software and hardware, and managing the entire data system through outsourcing. G.E. said it expected the venture to realize $100 million in sales in three to five years. Claudia H. Deutsch
2000-06-05	INVISIBLE STAIN -- A special report.; In War Over PCB's in Hudson, the E.P.A. Nears Its Rubicon	A generation-long tug of war between environmental officials and the General Electric Company over what, if anything, to do about the Hudson River's last big chemical stain is almost over. After 25 years of false starts and conflicting studies, the federal Environmental Protection Agency appears poised to order a cleanup of what it calls a persistent threat to people and wildlife: the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, that lace the river bottom north of Albany and contaminate many kinds of fish throughout the river.
2000-05-09	BellSouth Said to Be in a Deal With G.E. Satellite Division	Moving to offer digital television service throughout the Southeast, BellSouth intends to announce today that it has signed a long-term contract to purchase satellite services from General Electric, an executive close to the deal said yesterday. BellSouth had been rumored to be in discussions with Loral Space and Communications, a G.E. rival in the satellite industry.

2000-04-14	G.E. Reports Strong Revenue In First Quarter	General Electric, benefiting from resurgent global economies and its push into e-commerce, announced robust first-quarter revenue and earnings yesterday. For the quarter ended March 31, the company's revenue surged to $30 billion, up 24 percent from $24.2 billion in the period a year earlier. Net income rose to $2.6 billion, or 78 cents a diluted share, a 20 percent rise compared with the $2.16 billion, or 65 cents a share, earned in the quarter a year earlier.
2000-03-31	G.E. Settles Shareholders' Suit Over Kidder	The General Electric Company will pay its stockholders $19 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that contended that actions by Joseph Jett, a bond trader for Kidder, Peabody & Company, a former G.E. subsidiary, inflated Kidder's net worth and deceived shareholders about the value of G.E. stock, according to a settlement filed on Wednesday. In the suit, investors said they overpaid for G.E. stock in 1993 and 1994 because Mr. Jett created phony profits that overstated Kidder's financial performance by $350 million.
2000-03-29	To Put G.E. Online Meant Putting a Dozen Industries Online	EARLY last year, John F. Welch, the chief executive and chairman of General Electric, set an ambitious goal for the managers of the huge company's businesses -- establish a strategy for using the Internet and put it into effect before the end of 1999. All 12 of G.E.'s departments, from airplane engines to appliances to industrial systems, met the goal that the company, long the leader of the old economy, had set as part of its ferocious battle to transform itself into a leader of the new economy.
2000-03-16	Suit Seeks Options In Dishwasher Recall	SHOULD consumers with defective G.E. dishwashers rewire them or buy new ones? And how much of the cost should G.E. pick up? From April 1983 to January 1989, General Electric produced 3.1 million G.E. and Hotpoint dishwashers with a defective air-drying switch that has the potential to melt or ignite, creating a fire hazard. The switch has caused no injuries, but there have been 50 hazardous incidents, three of which damaged houses. About 900,000 of the dishwashers were in use nationwide by consumers and property managers when G.E. began a recall last year.
2000-03-14	G.E. Gets $2 Billion in Turbine Contracts	General Electric, the No. 1 maker of gas-fired turbines, said it had won $2 billion in contracts to provide 36 turbines for power plants being built by the closely held Panda Energy International. The price for the 24 gas and 12 steam turbines includes 12 years of maintenance by G.E.'s Power Systems division. The six plants will be in Oklahoma, Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. They will produce up to 6,000 megawatts, enough to light six million homes.
2000-03-06	General Electric Forms E-Commerce Division	The General Electric Company, already one of the top providers of electronic purchasing systems, said that it had formed an electronic-commerce unit that would compete with companies like Commerce One Inc. and Ariba Inc.

2000-02-18	G.E. Achieves Breakthrough In Gas Power-Turbine Design	The Energy Department and General Electric will announce on Friday a major breakthrough in natural-gas- powered generating plants that will result in production of electricity using 5.3 percent less fuel than the best current technologies. While that percentage may seem small, it is enormous by the standards of an industry in which technologies often compete on the basis of fractions of a percentage point.
2000-02-02	NBC INTERNET AGREES TO BUY ALLBUSINESS.COM	NBC Internet Inc., an online company 47 percent owned by the NBC unit of the General Electric Company, agreed to buy AllBusiness.com for about $225 million in stock. The closely held AllBusiness.com offers products and information aimed at owners of small businesses and people who are starting a business. The company, founded in 1998 and based in San Francisco, has more than 100 employees. The acquisition is NBCi's largest since it was formed late last year and furthers the company's plan to expand into business-to-business services on the Internet.
2000-01-30	Welch, in the Air . . .	When Jack Welch wants to buy a Boeing business jet, he won't take no for an answer. Not even when it comes from Phil Condit, Boeing's chief executive, with an explanation that Boeing does not make a business jet. At Mr. Welch's behest, General Electric, which supplies Boeing with jet engines, calculated that a Boeing 737 business jet would cost only about as much as a smaller top-of-the-line business jet. ''Why the heck aren't we selling them?'' Mr. Welch asked Mr. Condit, who told the story last week. So, about three and a half years ago, Boeing and G.E. formed a business jet venture, with G.E. placing two of the first orders.
2000-01-22	George Crowley, 80, Developer Of the Modern Electric Blanket	George C. Crowley, an engineer and inventor whose work led to 80 patents, including one for the first thermostatically controlled electric blanket, died Jan. 15 in Pinehurst, N. C., after suffering from pneumonia. He was 80 years old. After his graduation in 1942 from the University of Notre Dame, where he was a third-string quarterback, Mr. Crowley joined the Navy and was assigned to the General Electric Company, which was engaged in numerous wartime technical projects. It was Mr. Crowley's development work on electrically heated flying suits that would enable pilots to fly above antiaircraft flak that led to his invention of the electric blanket, which was patented by the company.
2000-01-21	G.E. Registers 16% Net Gain For Quarter	The General Electric Company said today that its fourth-quarter profit rose 16 percent, to a record $3.09 billion, driven by sales of service contracts at industrial businesses and advertising at its NBC television network. Net income climbed to 93 cents a share. G.E. earned $2.67 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $32.9 billion, from $28.6 billion, more than analysts had expected, as the company increased market share at existing businesses and through acquisitions.
2000-01-14	G.E. Joining Effort on 'Smart' Appliances	The General Electric Company, the No. 1 maker of appliances for new homes in the United States, said it had agreed to develop standards with the Microsoft Corporation to connect so-called smart appliances with other consumer devices. G.E. said it would join Microsoft's Universal Plug and Play Forum, which includes Sony, International Business Machines and Intel. G.E. has a similar agreement with a Microsoft rival, Sun Microsystems Inc., among others.
2000-01-02	Another Cover Curse at Time Inc.?	If one bit of history is any guide, you might be wise to avoid Amazon.com stock in 2000. Call it the curse of being named person of the year by Time magazine, which for 1999 picked Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder of Amazon, the money-losing Internet retailer that the market thinks is worth $27 billion.
1999-12-30	South Korea in Talks to Sell G.E. and ABB an Industrial Stake	The South Korean government said today that it was in talks to sell as much as a 25 percent stake in the Korea Heavy Industries and Construction Company, or Hanjung, to the General Electric Company and a unit of ABB Ltd., the Swiss-Swedish company. ''G.E. and ABB have proposed in writing the range of their interest in acquiring Hanjung,'' the minister of commerce, industry and energy, Chung Duck Koo, said. Officials at both General Electric and ABB declined to comment.
1999-12-09	HOME DEPOT TO EXPAND SALES OF LARGE APPLIANCES	Home Depot Inc., the largest United States retailer of home-improvement supplies, said yesterday that it would start selling large appliances like refrigerators and dishwaters at most of its United States stores next year. It will sell only appliances made by the Whirlpool Corporation and the General Electric Company, according to its chief administrative officer, Ronald M. Brill. The Atlanta-based retailer now sells such appliances in 38 markets, covering about 15 percent of its United States stores. Home Depot's largest rival, the Lowe's Companies, already sells appliances. Home Depot has more than 900 stores.
1999-11-30	G.E. MAKES DEAL TO BUY MECON, A SOFTWARE MAKER	The General Electric Company, the biggest medical-imaging equipment maker, agreed to buy Mecon Inc. for about $81.2 million in stock to acquire software that lets hospitals compare prices for supplies over the Internet. G.E. will pay $11.25 in stock for each Mecon share. GE Medical Systems, based in Milwaukee, is adding to the range of services that it sells through the Internet Mecon's software helps hospitals manage costs more efficiently. Mecon granted G.E. an option to acquire newly issued shares, representing 19.9 percent of those outstanding. Shares of Mecon, based in San Ramon, Calif., rose $1.375 each, to $10.75. General Electric fell $2.50, to $133.125.
1999-11-27	NBC SET TO TAKE STAKE IN THE EGREETINGS NETWORK	The NBC unit of the General Electric Company is taking an equity stake in Egreetings Network Inc., an Internet provider of gifts and free greeting cards, to promote NBC shows on free online postcards. Terms were not disclosed. Egreetings will use shows like ''The Tonight Show'' and ''Providence,'' as themes for its free postcards and animations. It will promote the cards on its Web site and through e-mail to its 8 million users. On Oct. 14, San Francisco-based Egreetings filed to sell $75 million in stock to the public.
1999-11-26	Real Risks of PCB's	To the Editor: Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York is using a novel but questionable legal argument in suing General Electric for PCB discharges into the Hudson River (''A New Front in the PCB War,'' editorial, Nov. 19).
1999-11-25	Murdoch Ally Says He Erred On NBC Sale	A suggestion by Rupert Murdoch that NBC had been offered for sale to Time Warner was ''a bit of a mistake,'' an executive close to Mr. Murdoch said yesterday. The executive also sought to counter any criticism that with his remarks Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, had been seeking to affect the Time Warner stock price. Instead, the executive said, Mr. Murdoch had simply reacted to a television interviewer's unexpected question by repeating reports he had heard about the interest of Ted Turner, the Time Warner vice chairman, in acquiring NBC from General Electric. ''Rupert misspoke,'' said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
1999-11-19	A New Front in the PCB War	New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who has been suing big corporations right and left recently, has now charged General Electric with impeding navigation along a stretch of the Hudson River and thus preventing the river from reaching its full potential as a commercial and recreational waterway. The suit represents a novel attempt to speed a resolution of the 25-year controversy over PCB contamination in the Hudson. If successful, the suit may also establish a precedent for claims against other companies whose activities can be shown to have restricted economic development along New York's waterways. But the furor surrounding Mr. Spitzer's announcement inflates its immediate importance. The real battle is still the struggle between the company and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which will decide late next year whether to require G.E. to undertake an expensive dredging operation to rid several contaminated ''hot spots'' in the river of PCB's. G.E. has never denied responsibility for the chemicals, which were discharged from two now-defunct plants north of Albany years ago. The E.P.A. regards PCB's -- polychlorinated biphenyls -- as a health risk to wildlife and to people who regularly eat fish caught in the upper Hudson. PCB's are also among the biggest remaining obstacles to the ecological recovery of the river.
1999-11-18	Corrections	An article on Tuesday about a lawsuit filed against General Electric over PCB contamination of the Hudson River included an erroneous estimate from the State Attorney General, Eliot L. Spitzer, for the amount of the chemical dumped into the river over three decades. Mr. Spitzer, who filed the suit, said yesterday that the actual figure was 1.3 million pounds -- the amount acknowledged by G.E. -- and not a quantity exceeding 100 million pounds.
1999-11-16	State Sues G.E. Over Pollution In the Hudson	Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer sued General Electric today, the first time the state has ever taken the company to court over PCB contamination of the Hudson River, in an action that he says he hopes will open the door to many similar suits. The suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Albany, does not address the environmental and health effects of G.E.'s three decades of dumping PCB's into the river, issues that are the subject of an ongoing inquiry by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The agency is expected to decide next year whether to order widespread dredging of the river.
1999-11-14	Pataki Orders PCB Cleanup Near Hudson	The Pataki administration ordered General Electric today to clean 700,000 cubic feet of soil contaminated by PCB's at an old factory that dumped the chemicals in the Hudson River, a move that environmentalists lauded as a good, though limited, step. The cleanup order by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, which the department estimated would cost G.E. $28.4 million, applies only to the defunct plant in the village of Hudson Falls, 50 miles north of here. It does not address the far more contentious question of whether to dredge PCB-contaminated sediments in the river, a step long demanded by environmental groups, and resisted by G.E.
1999-11-04	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the coming retirement of John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric, misstated the title of David L. Calhoun, a possible successor. He is chief executive of the Employers Reinsurance Corporation, the largest unit of the GE Capital Services Corporation; Dennis Dammerman is chief executive of GE Capital itself. The article also misspelled the surname of a former G.E. executive who went to GTE. He is Thomas A. Vanderslice, not Vander Slice. An article in Business Day on Tuesday about coming changes in the leadership of General Motors misstated the given name of the chairman who was deposed in a boardroom shake-up seven years ago. He was Robert C. Stempel, not Roger.
1999-11-03	G.E.'s Chief Sets a Date To Step Down	Everyone knew it was coming, but now they know when: John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric, will retire after the company's annual meeting in April 2001. Mr. Welch, who announced the date on CNBC on Monday evening, will turn 65 on Nov. 19, 2000, and had always indicated he would step down then. But few read much more than symbolism into the later date. Mr. Welch became G.E.'s chief executive in April 1981, so the date will mark his 20th anniversary.
1999-11-03	Maybe 'the Best Manager in America,' Clearly a Model for Other Executives	When John F. Welch Jr. resigns from General Electric in April 2001, he will actually leave two vacancies: those of G.E.'s chief executive and corporate America's most-admired manager. The first post will be filled quickly, the appointment will likely be announced months before Mr. Welch steps aside. For the second job, however, there is no clear successor, management experts said yesterday, and that is a testament to the rarity of Mr. Welch's nearly two-decade run at the top of one of America's biggest companies.
1999-10-19	Rivals' Deal Raises Questions on Fate of British Aerospace	Ever since the end of the cold war, Europe's fragmented military industry has come to resemble a ponderous mating rite in which the surprises came not so much from the urge to consolidate as from the partners ticking the dance card. The newest unexpected coupling came last week when DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany and Aerospatiale Matra S.A. of France agreed to merge. With annual sales of $22 billion, the cross-border European behemoth would rank as the world's third-largest aerospace company after the Boeing Company and the Lockheed Martin Corporation.
1999-10-19	ENTERGY TO ACQUIRE 8 ADDITIONAL GAS TURBINES	The Entergy Corporation said yesterday that it planned to acquire eight gas turbines from the General Electric Company's General Power Systems unit for $160 million. The eight turbines are in addition to the 24 gas turbines and 4 steam turbines that Entergy said last week it would buy from GE Power Systems for $1.9 billion. Entergy, based in New Orleans, provides electricity to 2.5 million customers in the Southern United States and another 2 million customers overseas. GE Power Systems, a maker of power generation equipment, is based in Schenectady, N.Y. Delivery of the turbines is scheduled for as early as 2001, Entergy said.
1999-10-08	G.E.'s Profit Rose 16% in Third Quarter	The General Electric Company said today that its third-quarter profit rose 16 percent, helped by acquisitions and more sales of turbines, engines and contracts to service industrial equipment. Net income rose to $2.65 billion, or 80 cents a diluted share, compared with $2.28 billion, or 69 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue at G.E., which trails only the Microsoft Corporation in market value, rose 13 percent, to $27.2 billion from $24.14 billion.
1999-09-21	G.E. Passes $400 Billion in Market Value	The General Electric Company today became the second United States company to exceed $400 billion in market value. G.E.'s market value has risen more than $300 billion since its chairman, John F. Welch Jr., took over in April 1981. That achievement is second only to the Microsoft Corporation, whose market value reached $500 billion on July 16. G.E. has returned about 4,500 percent including dividends, or an average of 23 percent a year, since Mr. Welch took over, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has returned 17 percent a year.
1999-09-15	CNBC Invests In Electronic Stock Trader	CNBC yesterday demonstrated the new willingness of media companies to move out of the meat-and-potatoes business of news and into the world of finance itself, taking a 12.4 percent equity stake in Archipelago, the third-largest electronic communications network for trading stocks. In making the cash investment in the network -- which amounted to close to $30 million, according to a person briefed on the deal -- the financial news cable channel, a unit of the General Electric Company, is lending its imprimatur to one of the contenders in the free-for-all among the nine electronic communications networks currently vying to dominate the new electronic marketplace for stock trading.
1999-09-15	Algerian Work for G.E.	The General Electric Company, the world's No. 1 maker of gas turbines for power generation, said today that its Italian unit had agreed to build a power plant for Algeria's state-owned oil company for $107 million. The GE Nuovo Pignone unit, based in Florence, makes compressors and gas and steam turbines for the oil and gas industry worldwide. The new plant for Sonatrach, Algeria's oil and gas research and distribution company, will serve the Ghadames oilfield in southeastern Algeria.
1999-09-14	Capitalizing on Asian Doldrums; A G.E. Financial Unit Goes Rummaging for Bargains	Six years ago, GE Capital's Japanese presence consisted pretty much of Taketo Yamakawa, a one-man show in a small office, scrambling to come up with opportunities in a stifled economy. GE Capital, the biggest and most profitable unit of General Electric, one of America's biggest and most profitable corporations, had just bought a Japanese credit card company that it saw as its gateway to Asia -- and had put Mr. Yamakawa in charge. ''I was struggling, trying to identify businesses and companies that GE could do,'' Mr. Yamakawa recalled.
1999-09-13	NBC Sticks to Solo Strategy as Its Media Rivals Consolidate	In the wake of Viacom's multimillion-dollar betrothal to CBS, the media spotlight has swung around to NBC, the last network unwed to a movie studio and left to stand alone on the crowded, vertically integrated television dance floor. But as one executive close to NBC and familiar with its long-term strategy put it last week: ''Don't cry for NBC. NBC is not some wallflower that has been left at the altar. NBC is in a whole different church.''
1999-09-10	GENERAL ELECTRIC IS CUTTING 1,400 JOBS AT INDIANA PLANT	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it planned to cut 1,400 jobs at a refrigerator plant in Bloomington, Ind., or 44 percent of the plant's employees, and move some of the work to Mexico. G.E., one of Bloomington's largest employers, will also spend as much as $100 million to modernize remaining production lines at the plant, which makes side-by-side refrigerators. G.E. wants to shift production of high-end refrigerators to a joint venture in Mexico and keep mid-level models in Bloomington.
1999-09-08	GENERAL ELECTRIC TO BUY KVAERNER UNIT	Kvaerner S.A., Europe's largest shipbuilder, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell part of its natural gas power plant business to the General Electric Company. Kvaerner is selling businesses that build natural gas turbines and design and maintain natural gas power plants. They have annual sales of about $260 million and employ about 670 people in Norway, Scotland, and elsewhere, the company said. Kvaerner said the financial details of the transaction would not be determined until the sale is completed. G.E. confirmed that its Power Systems division was in talks with Kvaerner as part of G.E.'s plan to expand its power business.
1999-09-04	BOEING JET ENGINE PLAN	The Boeing Company's decision to award the General Electric Company exclusive rights to develop a new engine to power longer-range versions of its 777 jetliner will not face opposition from European Union antitrust regulators. Boeing, the world's biggest plane maker, has drawn criticism from customers like British Airways and American Airlines, which say their maintenance and training costs will rise if they have to switch to G.E.'s engines for longer-range versions of the 777. Boeing maintains that expected sales of the new 777 models -- 500 -- are not enough to justify the cost of having several suppliers.
1999-08-17	CHINA AIRLINE ORDER	Taiwan's largest airline, China Airlines, signed contracts to buy $800 million worth of engines from the General Electric Company and CFM International to power planes it ordered from the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie. The airline said last week that it would buy as many as 24 Boeings and 12 Airbuses in the next four years. CFM is a venture of General Electric and Snecma of France.
1999-08-07	SHELL JOINS PIPELINE PROJECT	The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Europe's biggest oil company, said it had joined the General Electric Company, the Bechtel Group Inc. and the Turkmenistan Government in a project to build a $2.5 billion natural gas pipeline to supply Turkey. The addition of Shell strengthens the project, which is competing with a rival plan from ENI S.p.A. of Italy and Gazprom of Russia.
1999-08-05	In Blow to G.E., Agency Finds Fish in Hudson Unsafe to Eat	In a major step toward a possible order to dredge the Hudson River, the Environmental Protection Agency reported today that PCB's pose an unacceptably high risk of cancer and other ills in people who eat fish from the river's northern reaches. The conclusions are bad news for the General Electric Company, which discharged the PCB's into the river from the 1940's to 1977 and could be forced to pay for a cleanup that might cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take a decade or more.
1999-08-05	AIRBUS ENGINE DEAL	Defying an industry trend, Air France said it would outfit 15 new Airbus Industrie A-318 single-aisle planes that it had on order from Airbus with engines by CFM International, a joint venture of the General Electric Company in the United States and Snecma S.A. of France. Airbus had said it would offer only Pratt & Whitney engines on the A-318, and its competitor, the Boeing Company, has said it would offer only G.E. turbines on its 777-200X and 777-300X. Air France argued successfully that it could cut costs by outfitting its new planes with the same engines used on its other single-aisle Airbus planes. John Tagliabue (NYT)
1999-07-31	G. C. Minor, 62, an Engineer Who Criticized Nuclear Power	Gregory Charles Minor, one of three middle-management engineers who caused a stir when they quit the General Electric reactor division in 1976 to protest nuclear power, died on July 20 at his home in Telluride, Colo. He was 62. The cause was leukemia, which had been diagnosed in early June, Jim Burch, a friend in Palo Alto, Calif., said.
1999-07-31	GENERAL ELECTRIC MAY CLOSE TWO REFRIGERATOR PLANTS	The General Electric Company may shut a refrigerator plant in Louisville, Ky., and cut 1,500 jobs, while adding production of a new refrigerator line in Mexico as part of its joint venture with Grupo P.I. Mabe S.A. General Electric, the No. 1 supplier of large appliances for newly built homes in the United States, notified the Louisville workers of the possible closing on Thursday. A company spokesman, Terry Dunn, said General Electric also planned to notify workers in Bloomington, Ind., that it may shut a refrigerator plant there that employs 3,100 people. These moves are prompted by regulations scheduled to take effect in June 2001 that will require new refrigerators to use 30 percent less energy and therefore render the existing models produced in both plants obsolete, Mr. Dunn said. The Louisville notice triggers a 45-day bargaining period.
1999-07-19	Compressed Data; G.E. Applies Its Talents To Internet Housekeeping	The General Electric Company's three-year-old Web page has just had a face lift to prepare for total reconstructive surgery in the fall. The immediate impact, starting tomorrow, will be fewer clicks to get from www.GE.com to, say, a list of stores that sell G.E. appliances. But wait a few months, the company promises, and you will be able just to type in ''I am a homeowner who needs a refrigerator,'' and the software will take it from there.
1999-07-09	G.E.'s Quarterly Earnings Top Expectations	The General Electric Company, benefiting from its continued push into high-margin service businesses as well as from improved efficiency, reported yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 15 percent, slightly beating analysts' expectations. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., posted earnings of $2.82 billion, or 85 cents a diluted share, which compared with $2.45 billion, or 74 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The company enjoyed strong top-line growth in each of its 11 businesses, lifting revenue 9.3 percent, to $27.4 billion from $25.1 billion.
1999-07-08	Boeing Picks G.E. to Build Engine for Its Long-Range 777 Jet	The Boeing Company said yesterday that it had chosen the General Electric Company to build the world's most powerful jet engine for a new ultra-long-range version of its wide-body 777 jetliner. The exclusive deal, which had been hotly contested, is a blow to Pratt & Whitney, a unit of the United Technologies Corporation, and Rolls-Royce P.L.C., both of which supply engines for the 777 along with G.E.
1999-06-20	G.E. Dispute Settled	A lawsuit over the proposed construction of a 75,000-square-foot General Electric aircraft hangar at Westchester County Airport has been resolved through negotiation, County Executive Andrew J. Spano's office reported last week. The site in Harrison that the company had hoped to build on is near the Kensico Reservoir, and a coalition of environmental groups filed suit in State Supreme Court in White Plains two years ago, arguing that the previous administration of County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act by approving the plan without requiring an environmental impact statement.
1999-06-15	BIG ORDER FOR EMBRAER	Latin America's leading aerospace manufacturer, Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A., won orders for passenger jets potentially worth as much as $6.2 billion, fueling the Brazilian company's turnaround from a state-controlled behemoth. Embraer, as the company is known, won the orders mainly from European carriers like Crossair of Switzerland and Skyways of Sweden. In addition, Embraer said it would join with the General Electric Company and Honeywell Inc. of the United States to develop a family of 70-seat and 90-seat regional jets, which would be larger than its existing aircraft. The orders will result in a 15 percent increase in Embraer's work force, adding about 1,000 employees. The orders were announced at the Paris Air Show by Mauricio Botelho, above, chief executive of Embraer. Carlos Leoni R. Siqueira, chairman of the Embraer board, said the company would eventually have to sell more shares to help finance its expansion. On the news of the orders, Embraer's shares surged as much as 55 percent on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. Simon Romero
2014-01-02	The Way We Live Now: 6-13-99: Word & Image; The Information Tyranny	The Web nuts of America career around the Internet celebrating a new freedom to shout and spout anything into the ether: no more restraints on speech, they insist; no more hierarchy of thought. I hope they were watching old-time public television for just an hour last week, as Bill Moyers documented our society's slide into a new information tyranny, how corporate wealth is monopolizing debate, corrupting politicians and dictating policy. (The program will be rebroadcast tonight on WNET in the New York area.) Moyers's thesis, oxymoronically titled ''Free Speech for Sale,'' began with a modest morality tale about how special interests can easily mislead the public. It featured Cindy Watson, the first Republican in a century to represent her rural district in the North Carolina Legislature. Responding to her constituency, she helped pass a moratorium to limit the growth of hog farming until something was done to control the hog waste that spewed nauseating ammonia fumes across the landscape.
1999-06-11	New Infection Kills Software Through E-Mail	Computer researchers today reported a malicious computer program that is spreading rapidly through the Internet by E-mail and destroying documents created by widely used Microsoft software programs. Several large corporations, including Boeing, AT&T and General Electric, said their computers had been infected and moved to limit the damage, in some cases by shutting down their E-mail systems. Employees of Microsoft, Intel and the anti-virus software maker Symantec said they had also been hit.
1999-06-01	No Apologies as Solomon Takes Eagerly to Lobbying for G.E.	For 20 years, Gerald B. H. Solomon represented the 22d Congressional District in New York with such probusiness gusto that environmentalists called him ''the Congressman from General Electric.'' It was not meant as a compliment, but Mr. Solomon, a former marine, wore the sobriquet as proudly as a medal. Today, six months after Mr. Solomon, a Republican, retired from Congress, the nickname fits better than ever. He is now a lobbyist for the General Electric Company.
1999-05-17	GE Capital to Buy $11 Billion In Loans From Japanese Bank	The financial services arm of the General Electric Company said today that it would buy the $11 billion United States commercial loan portfolio of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, the unit's fifth acquisition or venture in Japan since last year. The unit, GE Capital, which is the world's largest nonbank finance company, said the purchase would be completed by December. It did not disclose the terms of the transaction.
1999-05-13	NBC Faulted On Deletions In TV Film	NBC removed references to the transportation of nuclear waste from a television movie it will broadcast this Sunday night, citing inaccuracies in the depiction of how nuclear waste is handled. But Senator Richard H. Bryan of Nevada accused the network yesterday of caving in to pressure from lobbyists for nuclear power companies. Senator Bryan, a Democrat, said he had only circumstantial evidence that NBC had been so influenced, but he pointed to the fact that NBC's parent company, General Electric, has significant interests in the nuclear power industry. NBC executives said G.E. had no input in their decision.
1999-05-11	Distribution Deal Seen In Telecommunications	The NEC Corporation of Japan and the General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain are close to announcing a deal in which NEC will distribute G.E.C.'s telecommunications products, according to the London newspaper The Sunday Telegraph. The paper said the companies would also buy more than $:100 million ($163 million) of one another's products annually and cooperate on research and development.
1999-05-06	Rivals Team Up With National Geographic	The rival television networks NBC and Fox are teaming up with National Geographic Ventures to expand the National Geographic Channel to the United States. Fox, a subsidiary of the News Corporation, will own 50 percent of the channel's operations worldwide, except for areas covered by National Geographic U.K.; General Electric's NBC and National Geographic will each own 25 percent. Financial terms were not disclosed.
1999-05-01	G.E. Unit to Buy Big Retail Chain	The General Electric Company's finance arm will acquire all of the Montgomery Ward Holding Company, the seventh-largest United States department store company, as part of the retailer's bankruptcy reorganization plan, court papers show. The finance division, GE Capital Inc., is paying $650 million to take over the 43 percent of Montgomery Ward it does not already own and Ward's Signature Group direct marketing arm. The acquisition will take place under the retail chain's Chapter 11 reorganization plan filed today in United States Bankruptcy Court here.
1999-04-29	British Aerospace Discussing Joint European Missile Venture	British Aerospace P.L.C., the British military giant, acknowledged today that it was exploring a deal with French and Italian companies to create a European missile industry to challenge Raytheon of the United States, the global leader in missile manufacturing. The news emerged one day after British Aerospace signed a formal agreement Tuesday to acquire the British General Electric Company's Marconi Electronics defense and missile business. The $12.7 billion takeover was first announced last January and will now be examined by regulators. It brings together British Aerospace's military hardware, such as the Tornado warplanes in action over Yugoslavia, with Marconi's military and civilian electronics and missile guidance systems. Britain's General Electric is not linked to the United States company of the same name.
1999-04-27	G.E. of Britain in $4.5 Billion Acquisition	The General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain, accelerating the European rush into the data networking business, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Fore Systems Inc. for $4.5 billion in cash. Fore, which is based in Warrendale, Pa., is a leading developer of an advanced technology that many big communications carriers and multinational corporations are beginning to use to carry voice, data and sometimes video traffic on a single network.
1999-04-09	G.E. Reports 14% Increase In First-Quarter Earnings	The General Electric Company said today that its first-quarter earnings rose 14 percent as it took more profit from sales hurt by low prices for some of its products. Net income for G.E., the second-biggest United States company by market value, behind the Microsoft Corporation, rose to $2.16 billion, or 65 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.89 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results matched the average estimate of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings.
1999-04-06	OBSERVATORY	Wintry Uranus Winters may be long and hard here, but consider the situation on Uranus, the seventh planet in the solar system. There, where the seasons last for more than two decades, old man winter is a very old man indeed. But now, parts of Uranus are coming out of a long wintertime slumber. And a new time-lapse movie of images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows for the first time the seasonal changes taking place. Uranus, long considered fairly featureless, is wracked by spring storms.
1999-03-24	Europe Power-Plant Venture to Overtake G.E.	ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's leading electrical-engineering company, and Alstom S.A. of France have agreed to combine their power-plant manufacturing units as recessions in Asia cut profits. The joint venture, with $11 billion in annual sales, will leapfrog the General Electric Company of the United States to become the world's biggest maker of generating equipment. Alstom, the world's second-largest maker of energy-distribution equipment, will pay ABB $1.5 billion to set up ABB Alstom Power, and officials said some of the current 54,000 jobs would be eliminated.
1999-03-23	TI GROUP BUYS TRI-MANUFACTURING FROM UNIT OF G.E.	TI Group P.L.C. said yesterday it had bought Tri-Manufacturing from GE Aircraft Engines for $58 million. TI, based in Abingdon, England, is an engineering company with interests in seals and sealing systems, fluid carrying systems for refrigeration and aerospace systems and equipment. It had revenue of $:2.17 billion, or $3.5 billion, in 1998. Tri-Manufacturing, with headquarters in Terre Haute, Ind., makes components for jet engine manufacturers, including G.E. and Pratt & Whitney. GE Aircraft Engines, based in Evandale, Ohio, is a unit of General Electric Company, based in Fairfield, Conn.
1999-03-15	G.E. Chief Received $56.6 Million in '98	The chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company, John Welch Jr., took home $56.6 million in 1998, including $10.1 million in salary and bonus, during a year when G.E. stock rose 39 percent. Mr. Welch received $2.8 million in salary last year, a bonus of $7.2 million, and other compensation totaling $104,944, according to a regulatory filing. He also received $46.5 million, before taxes, by exercising options and stock-appreciation rights awarded in 1991 and 1992.
1999-03-14	Putting Evolution On Fast-Forward	The corporate chief who has created more shareholder value ($300 billion plus) than anyone not currently accused of monopolistic practices acknowledged in a New York appearance last week that he is a ''Neanderthal'' when it comes to computers. But that executive, John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric, is determined that each of his company's businesses will leap from the Stone Age to the 21st century when it comes to making the best use of the Internet.
1999-03-10	NBC Moves To Sell Goods To Its Viewers	Becoming the first broadcast network to own a portion of a home shopping channel, NBC announced yesterday that it would make a significant investment in the cable network Value Vision and link it with the NBC network, the cable channels CNBC and MSNBC, and the Web site MSNBC.com. With the move, NBC is positioning itself to deliver products directly to viewers. The move speaks to NBC's strategy to move away from the old network economic model, which has always generated revenue only through advertising.
1999-03-10	Study Finds Little Risks From PCB's	The largest ever study of occupational exposure to toxic PCB chemicals has found no significant increase in cancer deaths among workers who were exposed on the job. The study was financed by the General Electric Company, which faces potential liabilities of hundreds of millions of dollars for cleaning up waters, including the Hudson River, that are contaminated by PCB's. It is being published on Wednesday in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal.
1999-02-26	CBS Chief Wants To Acquire NBC	In a seemingly off-the-cuff remark that set off immediate media attention, Mel Karmazin, the president and chief executive of the CBS Corporation, said yesterday that he would like to buy NBC from the General Electric Company and would be willing to overpay ''to get a deal done.'' Mr. Karmazin, speaking at the American Association of Advertising Agencies conference in New Orleans, repeated an interest that he has articulated before. At a conference last year, he told Robert C. Wright, the NBC president, that if CBS could own another network, he would want NBC.
1999-02-25	GENERAL ELECTRIC 1999 EARNINGS SHOULD MEET ESTIMATES	The General Electric Company, the second-largest United States company by market value, expects to meet first-quarter and 1999 earnings estimates, say analysts who met yesterday with the chairman and chief executive, John F. Welch Jr. Mr. Welch said General Electric's business was good in the United States and Europe, and Asia was ''bottoming out,'' analysts said. Mr. Welch also reiterated that businesses representing 70 percent of General Electric's earnings will raise profits more than 15 percent this year. General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., is expected to earn 65 cents a share this quarter and $3.19 for the year, the average estimates of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation. Its shares fell $2, to $101.
1999-02-02	MONTGOMERY WARD TO SELL SIGNATURE GROUP	Montgomery Ward & Company announced steps toward a rescue plan yesterday that will include the sale of its Signature Group subsidiary to a major creditor, GE Capital Services Inc., a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, and said that it expected to emerge from bankruptcy protection in mid-1999. The company's statement said that GE Capital would recommend an extension of its current $1 billion loan through the end of the year and that Montgomery Ward would file a reorganization plan in the next few weeks. Proceeds from the sale of the Signature Group, a direct-marketing operation that was not part of the company's general bankruptcy filing, will be placed in a settlement fund to help cover the claims of other creditors. Montgomery Ward, based in Chicago, operates 252 retail stores.
1999-01-28	G.E.'s Comments on Disposal of PCB's Draw Objections	To many people in the Hudson Valley, the scenario is familiar: A stain of PCB's, toxic industrial chemicals, lies buried along the river. Environmental officials and residents are eager to dig it up, and General Electric presses to let the contaminants stay where they are. The difference this time is that General Electric had nothing to do with this particular pocket of pollution, which is in a fenced lot in Hastings-on-Hudson, a prosperous Westchester village 15 miles from Manhattan. General Electric's factories, which generated most of the PCB's in the river, are 150 miles upstream.
1999-01-23	Final Accord in G.E. Debt Collection Suit	The General Electric Company won a judge's final approval of a settlement valued at as much as $147 million today, ending lawsuits accusing the company of illegally collecting debts from bankrupt credit card customers. The settlement calls for G.E. to pay as much as $120 million to about 100,000 customers of its finance arm, the GE Capital Corporation, over the company's failure to properly file debt-repayment agreements in bankruptcy court.
1999-01-21	G.E. Reports 14% Profit Gain As It Does More Service Work	The General Electric Company, which makes everything from light bulbs to locomotives, said today that its fourth-quarter profit rose 14 percent as the company sold more industrial service contracts. Net income climbed to $2.67 billion, or 80 cents a diluted share, compared with $2.35 billion, or 70 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results matched analysts' expectations. Revenue rose 7 percent, to $28.6 billion from $26.7 billion.
1999-01-20	British Aerospace Deal Upsets European Arms Industry	British Aerospace P.L.C. announced a $9.5 billion stock deal for the Marconi Electronics Systems unit of the General Electric Company P.L.C. today, creating a British colossus that will be one of the world's biggest military contractors. Those plans may end months of speculation about the potential creation of a pan-European military company to challenge the American giants.
1999-01-19	G.E. of Britain in Talks to Sell Arms Unit	Britain's leading military contractors British Aerospace P.L.C. and the General Electric Company P.L.C. -- acknowledged today that they were in ''advanced discussions'' on a deal for General Electric's Marconi Electronic Systems that could be worth as much as $13 billion. The brief announcement, confirming newspaper reports here, pushed British Aerospace stock down by 25.5 pence, or 5 percent, to 493.5, reflecting analysts' fears that the company would pay too much for Marconi. Shares of General Electric, which is not related to General Electric of the United States, rose 8 pence, to 577.5, on a day when London share prices rose 3 percent.
1999-01-18	BORROWERS BEWARE: A Special Report; Suits Say Unscrupulous Lending Is Taking Homes From the Poor	By all appearances, the loan agreement Gloria Knight signed in 1995 was a classic transaction between savvy mortgage salesmen and an unsophisticated borrower in a poor Brooklyn neighborhood. Ms. Knight, a retired teacher, says the salesmen who knocked on her door persuaded her to put her house up as collateral for an $88,000 loan, at 13 percent interest, to help with bills and a previous loan -- even though she had no income and no way to make the $973 monthly payments.
1999-01-13	G.E. Industrial Division Buys Ultrasonic	The General Electric Company, the top supplier of power-generation equipment and services, said today that it had bought the closely held Ultrasonic Field Services Corporation to expand the service business of its Power Systems division. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Ultrasonic, based in Los Angeles, helps inspect machinery and turbines at oil, steel, aircraft and utility companies using ultrasonic technology. The company's equipment allows a manufacturer to evaluate a piece of equipment without the delays and costs of dismantling it.
1998-12-24	4 European Companies Close to Satellite Deal	Four of Europe's largest aerospace companies said yesterday that they were close to combining parts of their businesses to create Europe's biggest commercial satellite maker, with sales of more than $3 billion.
1998-12-23	G.E. of Britain Wants Separate Military Unit	The General Electric Company P.L.C., Britain's second-largest military contractor, said yesterday that it would split its aerospace and military businesses from the rest of its operations as it continues merger talks with other military companies. The military business includes missile controls, submarines and satellites. The company also makes home appliances, phone equipment and telecommunications switches.
1998-12-16	G.E. STOCK SOARS AFTER CHIEF PREDICTS A GAIN IN EARNINGS	Stock in the General Electric Company, owner of the world's largest nonbank finance company and of the NBC television network, soared yesterday after the company told analysts that its earnings would rise at least 14 percent a share next year. The company's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., said at a closed meeting on Monday in New York that profit at all but four of the company's 11 main businesses would rise 15 percent to 20 percent in 1999, according to analysts who attended. G.E.'s shares rose $6.3125, to $93.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, making the stock the biggest gainer of the day among those used to compute the Dow Jones industrial average.
1998-12-14	G.E. of Britain in Merger Talks With Several Global Concerns	The General Electric Company of Britain P.L.C., which has held merger talks with British Aerospace P.L.C. on an occasional basis since 1993, is in ''intense'' merger talks with a number of global companies and expects a decision ''soon,'' the company said today. ''We are still looking at our options and have a number of options,'' said Alasdair Jeffrey, a spokesman for the company. But the company declined to identify the companies involved in talks.
1998-12-09	Head of GE Capital Services Resigns in Shake-Up	In a management shake-up that had been the subject of months of speculation, Gary C. Wendt resigned yesterday as the head of GE Capital Services, the huge financial-services arm of the General Electric Company. Mr. Wendt, 56, viewed as the executive largely responsible for creating the powerhouse that fuels General Electric's impressive earnings growth, was replaced by Dennis D. Dammerman, General Electric's longtime chief financial officer.
1998-12-07	Six Sigma Enlightenment; Managers Seek Corporate Nirvana Through Quality Control	Heard the latest management mantra? Six Sigma. In consultant-speak, it denotes the path to a corporate nirvana where everything -- from product design to manufacturing to billing -- proceeds without a hitch. In engineer-speak, it means no more than 3.4 defects per million widgets or procedures.
1998-12-06	Bid for Hangar Withdrawn	In an abrupt move, the General Electric Company late last month withdrew its proposal for a hangar at the County Airport. The action came just before the Environment Committee of the Board of Legislators was to vote on a recommendation that G.E. provide an environmental-impact study. The proposed 75,000-square-foot corporate hangar would have been situated near Rye Lake and the Kensico Reservoir, which supplies 90 percent of New York City's drinking water.
1998-11-30	G.E. Division May Buy Unit Of Japan Bank	In a move that would give it a needed edge in Japan's corporate leasing market, the GE Capital Services Corporation, the huge financial services arm of the General Electric Corporation, may acquire the leasing arm of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. Although G.E. would not confirm the negotiations, which were reported in several Japanese newspapers, people close to the company say talks are in progress. But they say they believe that the $900 billion yen (about $7.3 billion) cited in the newspapers is more than G.E. is willing to pay. If it does pay that much, this would be largest corporate acquisition to date in Japan.
1998-11-22	Latest Issue In G.E. Bid For Hangar	THE debate surrounding a proposal to build a General Electric Company hangar at the County Airport in Harrison continues to set environmentalists and some of the airport's residential neighbors against construction and business interests and G.E. The latest issue in the dispute centers on whether the proposed 75,000-square-foot hangar requires an environmental impact statement. The county's Board of Legislators are to vote to decide whether to require G.E. to provide an impact statement or to forgo it. State law requires an environmental impact statement if a proposed project could have an adverse effect on the environment.
1998-11-22	An Airport Hangar For G.E. Is Debated	THE debate surrounding a proposal to build a General Electric Company hangar at the Westchester County Airport near the Greenwich border continues to set environmentalists and some of the airport's residential neighbors against construction and business interests and G.E. The latest issue in the dispute centers on whether the proposed 75,000-square-foot hangar requires an environmental impact statement. The Westchester County Board of Legislators will vote to decide whether to require G.E., with headquarters in Fairfield, to provide an impact statement or to forgo it. New York State law requires an environmental impact statement if a proposed project could have an adverse effect on the environment.
1998-11-19	ELSCINT TO SELL UNIT TO GE MEDICAL FOR $100 MILLION	Elscint Ltd. agreed yesterday to sell its diagnostic imaging unit for $100 million to a General Electric Company medical-systems subsidiary as it sheds established technologies. Elscint, a subsidiary of Elbit Medical Imaging Ltd., is selling off business units to concentrate on guided-image therapy, which uses electronic imaging for treatment. The buyer, GE Medical, is the world's biggest maker of computer X-ray and magnetic-resonance imaging machines. Earlier this week Elscint, based in Haifi, Israel, agreed to sell its computer-tomography division for $269.5 million to Picker International Inc., a unit of the London-based General Electric Company P.L.C., which is not related to the General Electric in the latest deal.
1998-11-15	A Long Way From the Light Bulb	Roger Lowenstein reviews At Any Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of Profit (M)
1998-11-01	Laundry-Room 'Education'	Having long since saturated every mass medium and most public places with ''brand awareness messages,'' marketers constantly search for fresh opportunities to stuff an ad into the few remaining unsold seconds of a consumer's waking hours. Usually that means finding a new way to invade the home -- and a rationale to make the incursion go down easier with a suspicious public. A recent classic of the genre proclaims that ''two of America's leading names in laundry are teaming up in a new consumer-education effort'' to help simplify the lives of consumers by providing ''useful cleaning information when and where they need it most.''
1998-10-20	G.E. Saves in Turbine Deal	Stewart & Stevenson Services agreed today to return $84 million to the General Electric Company after lowering by 14 percent, to $516 million, the price G.E. is paying for a gas-turbine business. It said that to do so, it would take a charge of $20 million, or 71 cents a share, in its fiscal quarter ending on Oct. 31 and that part of the reason for the adjustment was weak demand from Asia.
1998-10-12	G.E.'s Plan to Build a Hangar For Corporate Jets Hits a Snag	In December, the Westchester County Legislature approved a plan by General Electric to build a 75,000-square-foot hangar at the county airport to house two company jets the size of Boeing 737's. But after a lawsuit by critics with environmental concerns, and a change in county leadership, the plan could be in jeopardy. Under the proposal, G.E. would build the $20 million hangar for two Boeing Business Jets, new planes that are three times as large as the average corporate jet, said Barbara Murphy, a Boeing spokeswoman. G.E. would pay the county $6.7 million in rent over 30 years and $325,000 in yearly property taxes to the county; the Town of Harrison, home of the airport, and the Harrison school district. The company's headquarters are in Fairfield, Conn., a 45-minute drive from the Westchester County Airport.
1998-10-11	Battling It Out on the Links Is All in a Day's, uh, Work	General Electric's official line is that while John F. Welch loves to talk about the company's success, he keeps his golf game private. A similar message comes from Sun Microsystems about its chairman, Scott G. McNealy. But put your ear to the fairway, and you will hear more than the thwack of golf balls. The two chief executives apparently learned from Golf Digest last May that they were among the nation's top golfing C.E.O.'s -- Mr. Welch has a 3.8 handicap index and Mr. McNealy a slightly better 3.2. They agreed to play in Nantucket, and Golf World reported that Mr. Welch emerged victorious. Pressed for details, the folks at Sun suggest that patience is in order, with an announcement likely to emerge soon. Might it be a copy of the scorecard? Not likely. Seems a ''gimme'' that the two men cut a business deal on the links.
1998-10-09	G.E. Profit Rise Meets Estimates	The General Electric Company said today that its third-quarter profit rose 13 percent, matching expectations, even as delayed shipments of power-generating equipment were partly responsible for disappointing sales growth. Net income at G.E., owner of the world's largest nonbank finance company and the top-rated NBC television network, rose to $2.28 billion, or 69 cents a diluted share, from $2.01 billion, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 9.8 percent, to $24.14 billion from $21.99 billion, less than the 15 to 20 percent increase that G.E. predicted in early September.
1998-10-02	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Hints of Change at GE Capital as Financial Companies Lose Favor	Has GE Capital, the mammoth financial services operation, become too much of a good thing for its parent, the General Electric Company? Its relentless growth over the years has made it a key source of profit for G.E. and one of the reasons that the company is famous for making its numbers. But with the tumult abroad and at home causing investors to shy away from financial service concerns, G.E. could be looking for ways to divert attention from this golden goose. Speculation is rampant that General Electric will soon announce sweeping changes at the subsidiary. Gary C. Wendt, GE Capital's chief executive and the man largely responsible for its success, is widely expected to leave. In addition to naming new leadership to replace him, General Electric is said to be close to a reorganization of GE Capital that would make it easier to manage and a less visible force on the parent company's bottom line.
1998-09-25	G.E. Agrees to Clean Part of Tainted River in Massachusetts	The General Electric Company has agreed to spend $150 million to $200 million to clean up a contaminated stretch of river in western Massachusetts in a settlement that Federal regulators described today as a significant victory for the environment and a city. In announcing the deal, the company and the Environmental Protection Agency said removing sediment laden with PCB's from an abandoned electric-transformer plant would rejuvenate a two-mile stretch of the Housatonic River and the city it flows through, Pittsfield, Mass.
1998-09-22	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Consolidation Among Medical-Device Makers	A note to shareholders of all medical-device manufacturers: This is only the beginning. Struggling to ratchet up market share, the nation's medical-device makers are out to snap up their weaker brethren at a startling pace.
1998-09-22	Metro Business; G.E. Filing on Taxes Draws Senator's Fire	The General Electric Company failed to disclose its New York State and local tax payments properly in a report to the Federal Government, says a state senator who questioned whether the company had paid any New York taxes at all. State Senator Franz Leichter said yesterday that General Electric had reaped the benefits of millions of dollars in state tax breaks while continuing to cut jobs. A spokesman for General Electric, Tony Zehnder, called Mr. Leichter's accusations ''silly'' and said the company had paid ''many millions of dollars to the State of New York'' in taxes.
1998-09-12	ELBIT MEDICAL IMAGING IS SELLING PIECES OF BUSINESS	Elbit Medical Imaging Ltd., a company based in Israel, said yesterday that it would sell pieces of its medical diagnostic imaging business to two buyers for about $375 million in cash. Elbit will sell its computed tomography division to Picker International Inc., a unit of the General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain, for $275 million. Picker, based in Cleveland, said it was looking to expand its presence in CT scanning, which lets physicians look at cross sections of internal human anatomy, in several markets around the world. The medical systems unit of the General Electric Company of Fairfield, Conn., will buy Elbit's nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging businesses for about $100 million to bolster its own product lines. The two General Electrics are not related.
1998-09-11	G.E. Introduces Faster Medical Scanner	Amid much hoopla, the General Electric Company introduced a medical scanner yesterday that it says captures images of the inner workings of a patient's body in seconds, not minutes. G.E. expects to sell about 400 of the new CT (for computed tomography) scanners a year, at $1.25 million each -- barely a top-line ripple for a company that had $90.8 billion in revenues last year. But, it is the first G.E. product made with the much ballyhooed Six Sigma process for reducing defects, and at an hourlong news conference in New York, G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch, positioned it as a huge symbolic stride.
1998-09-06	G. E. Hangar	The Board of Legislators will conduct an environmental review of a revised plan by General Electric to build a hangar at the County Airport in Harrison, Legislator Michael B. Kaplowitz, Democrat of Somers, said. ''It's a serious economic and environmental matter and deserves our serious attention,'' said Mr. Kaplowitz, who is the chairman of the Board's Committee on the Environment.
1998-08-31	Few Bidders for Networks Despite Good Curb Appeal	Hardly a week goes by without a new rumor of an imminent sale or merger involving the CBS Corporation's television business or General Electric's network, NBC. The president of CBS, Mel Karmazin, who announced a partial spinoff of the company's radio and outdoor advertising businesses last week, is looking for ways to lift the share price of CBS in the face of widespread investor pessimism about the future of television. NBC's president, Robert C. Wright, has already said that his company is looking for new revenue opportunities for its programming -- including joint ventures with cable programmers.
1998-08-07	G.E. to Settle Debt-Collection Lawsuits	The General Electric Company agreed today to pay as much as $147 million to settle lawsuits and consumer complaints accusing it of illegally collecting debts from bankrupt credit-card customers, said Fredric L. Ellis, a lawyer representing consumers in the case. G.E. disputed the settlement figure, saying in a statement that it had agreed to pay less than $100 million to debtors who contended the company's finance unit, GE Capital Corporation, failed to properly file consumers' debt-repayment agreements in bankruptcy court. G.E. said it fully reserved for the settlement last year and it will be immaterial to GE Capital's 1998 earnings.
1998-08-01	SNECMA-G.E. UNIT GETS $300 MILLION JET-ENGINE ORDER	CFM International said yesterday that it had received a $300 million order from Boullioun Aviation Services Inc. for CFM56-7 engines for 30 Boeing Company Boeing-737 aircraft. CFM International is a joint venture between France's state-owned aviation company, Snecma S.A., and the General Electric Company. Boullioun, an aircraft leasing company in Bellevue, Wash., that is a unit of the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company of Japan, also placed an option for an additional 30 engines. Delivery of the 737's to Boullioun is scheduled between 2001 and 2006.
1998-07-25	GE CAPITAL BUYING CONSUMER LENDING UNIT IN JAPAN	The General Electric Company's finance arm will buy the consumer finance business of Lake, Japan's fifth-largest consumer lender, as it expands in Japan's $43 billion consumer lending market. Lake makes loans to individuals with poor credit histories at an average annual interest rate of 26 percent -- more than six times the rate on the average Japanese mortgage. The GE Capital Company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., and is the world's largest nonbank finance company, did not say how much it was paying for the lender.
1998-07-24	Toxic Chemicals From 1970's Still Pollute Hudson, Study Says	A Federal environmental study has found that ''hot spots'' of PCB contamination in the upper Hudson River are not being buried in protective layers of silt, as some scientists have contended, but instead are disgorging fresh streams of the industrial PCB pollutants into the water, where they could accumulate in fish and pose a cancer threat to people who eat the fish. As a result, senior officials with the Environmental Protection Agency said today that it might be necessary this fall to conduct accelerated cleanups of some hot spots, possibly including dredging or covering the zones where the escape of PCB's into the river is most severe.
1998-07-19	War on Environment Continues in Senate	To the Editor: Last week Carol M. Browner, the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, appeared in Albany to attack the General Electric Company on the issue of PCB's and the Hudson River (news article, July 10).
1998-07-17	GEMSTAR REJECTS UNITED VIDEO TAKEOVER OFFER	Gemstar International Group Ltd. yesterday rejected a $45-a-share cash takeover bid by United Video Satellite Group Ltd., characterizing it as inadequate. United Video, a company based in Tulsa, Okla., that is controlled by Tele-Communications Inc., provides program guides and other services to media companies. It disclosed the $2.8 billion offer to buy Gemstar, which is based in Pasadena, Calif., on July 6. United Video recently agreed to acquire TV Guide magazine for $2 billion. Separately, the General Electric Company's NBC network unit and Gemstar agreed to develop interactive program guide services. Under the agreement, NBC will acquire a 5 percent stake in TDN, a joint venture of Gemstar and Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., based in Circleville, Ohio.

1998-07-12	Setbacks Challenge The Hudson	SO far, 1998 has been a long and dispiriting year for the Hudson River. The first worrisome news came in February, when the Federal Environmental Protection Agency delayed its long-awaited decision on the cleanup of the river -- putting off until 2001 a decision on whether to order General Electric to remove polychlorinated biphenyls from a 200-mile stretch of the river, which is one of the largest Superfund sites in the United States.
1998-07-10	U.S. Environmental Chief Attacks G.E. Pollution Ads	The Clinton Administration's top environmental official said today that an ongoing publicity campaign by the General Electric Company playing down the health hazard from its factories' pollution of the Hudson River ''could put people's health at risk.'' Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, accused the company of trying to confuse the public as part of a broad effort to delay or limit the cleanup of tons of PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, that coat the river bottom for 200 miles and make the Hudson the most extensive Federal Superfund site in the United States.
1998-07-10	G.E. Posts 13% Rise in 2d-Quarter Profits	The General Electric Company said today that its second-quarter profit rose 13 percent, driven by record sales at the maker of everything from light bulbs to loans. Net income rose to $2.45 billion, or 74 cents a diluted share, aided by higher profits from its NBC television network and its aircraft engine unit. G.E.'s revenue rose 14 percent, to $25.1 billion.
1998-07-03	Britain's G.E.C. Says Revamping Is Complete	The General Electric Company P.L.C., Britain's largest manufacturer, said yesterday that it had finished reorganizing its business and had an $8 billion war chest to make acquisitions.
1998-06-25	British G.E.-Siemens Joint Ventures to End	The General Electric Company P.L.C. and Siemens A.G., the two largest electronics companies in Britain and Germany, agreed yesterday to end two British-based telecommunications joint ventures in a transaction worth $:700 million ($1.17 billion) as they concentrate on different ends of the market. Siemens will be paid $:610 million in cash for its 40 percent stake in GPT, which makes telephone network switches. It will also receive General Electric's 50 percent stake, minus one share, in Siemens GEC Communication Systems Ltd., which designs corporate phone networks and video conferencing systems.
1998-05-25	Metro Matters; In PCB Fight, It's the Nun Vs. the C.E.O.	AT the General Electric shareholders' meeting last month, there were several items of business likely to irritate even the most mild-mannered C.E.O. First, there was a proposal to limit G.E.'s spending on political contributions, which the resolution's sponsor labeled ''nothing more than a thinly disguised bribe.''
1998-05-22	Motorola Drops Plan for Its Own Data Satellites	Motorola Inc. announced yesterday that it had agreed to scrap its $12.9 billion plan to build a satellite network capable of delivering high-speed data communications anywhere on earth and instead join a rival but equally ambitious project to build an ''Internet in the sky.'' Motorola said it would invest about $750 million in exchange for 26 percent of the project, Teledesic L.L.C., which was founded by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and Craig O. McCaw, the cellular phone pioneer who sold his company to AT&T in 1993 for $12.6 billion.
1998-05-17	Airport Plans	The Board of Legislators is reviewing a decision by a State Supreme Court justice in White Plains blocking a proposal by General Electric to build a $20 million hangar and seven-acre extension of a runway for company jets at Westchester County Airport, the Board's Chairman, George S. Latimer, said last week. Justice John P. DiBlasi ruled last month that the Board and former County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke failed to conduct an adequate analysis of the hangar's environmental impact before approving construction within 1,000 feet of the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla.
1998-05-14	Cleaning Up in the Dark; Companies Disclose Little About Costs of Toxic Sites	Eighteen years after the passage of sweeping legislation to clean up the worst of the nation's toxic waste dumps, much of the job remains undone. American companies will have to spend billions of dollars in coming years to decontaminate the most polluted Superfund sites. But that is not at all obvious from scouring the companies' annual financial reports and filings. Many companies, including General Electric and Viacom, only hint at their obligations in their filings and annual reports, leaving the people who invest in their stocks, live near their properties and work in their factories in the dark about when they plan to make amends -- and how much they expect to spend.
1998-05-07	Samsung in Talks to Sell Units and Consolidate	The Samsung Group, one of South Korea's biggest industrial conglomerates, said on Wednesday that it was in talks to sell some of its units to General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as part of a move to raise $13 billion to repay debt and reduce the sprawling organization to five main businesses. Hewlett-Packard, the world's second-largest computer company, confirmed that it had discussions since February to buy all or part of Samsung's 45 percent in HP Korea, a 14-year-old joint venture that sells computers and printers and makes power-supply devices. Samsung and G.E. have a medical-equipment joint venture in South Korea. G.E. officials here and in the United States declined to comment.
1998-05-05	A G.E.-Mexico Locomotive Deal	The General Electric Company said today that TFM, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican railroad operator, had ordered 75 locomotives with maintenance contracts in a transaction valued at several hundred million dollars as Mexico makes its railroads private. G.E.'s Transportation Systems unit will deliver 50 locomotives starting this month and the other 25 in 1999, a G.E. spokeswoman, Susan Breon, said. She would not say how much the engines would cost TFM or give a value for the 20-year maintenance contracts.
1998-05-01	G.E. Hangar Plan Is Blocked in Court	A justice in State Supreme Court in White Plains yesterday blocked a proposal by General Electric to build a $20 million hangar for company jets at the Westchester County Airport, lawyers for both sides in the case said. Justice John P. DiBlasi ruled that the County Board of Legislators and former County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke failed to conduct an adequate analysis of the hangar's environmental impact before they approved it in December. The hanger would have been built 1,000 feet from the Kensico Reservoir.
1998-04-17	GEC Alsthom to Produce $1.3 Billion Dividend	Alcatel Alsthom S.A. and the General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain P.L.C. will get a special dividend of about $1.3 billion from their GEC Alsthom venture before its initial public offering in June, Alcatel said yesterday. The dividend, which will be split between Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment maker, and General Electric of Britain, the electronics producer, will compensate for investments made since GEC Alsthom was formed in 1989.
1998-04-10	GEC Alsthom to Acquire A Division from Alcatel	GEC Alsthom N.V., a joint venture of the General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain and Alcatel Alsthom of France, agreed yesterday to acquire Cegelec, Alcatel's engineering and systems division. Terms were not disclosed. Cegelec has annual sales of 3.3 billion European Currency Units ($3.6 billion), or about one-third of GEC Alsthom's annual sales.
1998-04-10	ISRAELI ULTRASOUND UNIT IS SOLD TO G.E. FOR $228 MILLION	Elbit Medical Imaging Ltd., an affiliate of Elron Electronic Industries, both of Haifa, Israel, sold its ultrasound division yesterday to GE Medical Systems, a unit of the General Electric Company, for $228 million.

Elron owns companies in medical diagnostic imaging, military electronics, communication, semiconductors, networking, software and information technology.
1998-04-09	G.E. Earnings Climb 12.5% In Quarter;	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its earnings rose 12.5 percent in the first quarter as the company's efforts to cut costs and to find new markets apparently continued to pay off. Net income rose to $1.89 billion, or 57 cents a diluted share, from $1.68 billion, or 50 cents, a year earlier. The results matched analysts' estimates, as 11 of G.E.'s 12 main businesses recorded higher pretax profit, analysts said.
1998-03-08	Groups Sue G.E.	A proposed General Electric hangar for company jets at the County Airport -- 1,000 feet from the Kensico Reservoir -- could damage the water supply, according to a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in White Plains by a coalition of eight environmental and housing groups. In papers filed by the coalition -- which represents, among others, the Riverkeeper, the Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, the New York Public Interest Research Group, Federated Conservationists of Westchester County and the Harrison residents Karen and Julius Shultz -- the petitioners argue that the county violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act by approving the plan without requiring an environmental impact statement.
1998-03-07	Hudson River Cleanup	To the Editor: John Cronin (Op-Ed, Feb. 28) objects to the Environmental Protection Agency's delaying its decision on the Hudson River cleanup to conduct further scientific review. How can it be controversial for the E.P.A. to listen to the affected public and to insure that good science is used in its decision? Perhaps the critics don't recognize that the Hudson itself is taking care of the PCB issue, with help from General Electric.
1998-02-28	The Hudson Still Waits for Help	Op-Ed article by John Cronin says Environmental Protection Agency seems to care more about politics than pollution; says 24 years after EPA issued report finding two General Electric factories dumped record amount of PCB's into Hudson River, EPA is still postponing decision on whether GE must clean up the mess it made, at cost to GE of $500 million to $2 billion; says GE has fought river cleanup by spending millions of dollars on public relations specialists and lobbyists; drawing (M)
1998-02-28	Deferring the Hudson River Cleanup	The Environmental Protection Agency's decision to delay its final report on PCB contamination of the Hudson River exasperated New Yorkers who have waited 20 years for a plan of action to clean the river of its most dangerous chemical. Environmentalists were especially distressed because the E.P.A., which had lately showed some gumption on the issue, appeared to have caved in to pressure from the General Electric Company, whose factories polluted the river, and from Representative Gerald Solomon of Glens Falls, who runs the House Ways and Means Committee. The situation is actually more complex than it seems. The E.P.A.'s own investigators, faced with new and contradictory scientific evidence, had decided to ask for more time even before Mr. Solomon intervened. Yet given the agency's history of dilatory behavior -- it did not begin its investigation until 1990, 13 years after PCB's had been banned as a cancer risk -- it is fair to ask of it two things. First, it must remember that the Federal Government is ultimately responsible for deciding what to do about the PCB's, not G.E. and certainly not Mr. Solomon. Second, it should announce a schedule for completing the investigation and set a target date for a final decision on how best to clean the river.
1998-02-25	G.E. Wins Delay of Study on Cleaning Up Hudson	Under pressure from the General Electric Company and a powerful upstate Congressman, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has decided to slow down completion of an important study of PCB contamination in the Hudson River. The move will probably delay for several years a final decision by the Government on how to revive the tainted waterway whose fisheries have been ruined by PCB's buried in sediments along 200 miles of its muddy shores and silty bottom. G.E., whose factories dumped the bulk of the oily chemical into the Hudson, would be largely responsible for any cleanup.
1998-02-18	G.E. Unit Forms Link To Japanese Life Insurer	GE Financial Assurance, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, plans to form a life insurance joint venture in Japan with the financially troubled Toho Mutual Insurance Company, the companies said today. A link between the companies had been expected since the G.E. unit said two weeks ago that they were in talks.
1998-02-14	MITEL BUYING PLESSEY SEMICONDUCTORS FOR $225 MILLION	The Mitel Corporation, a Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, said yesterday that it had acquired Plessey Semiconductors Ltd., which focuses on the telecommunications, media and personal computer markets, and some related units from the General Electric Company P.L.C. for $225 million in cash to expand its line of radio-frequency and mixed-signal design equipment. Shares of Mitel, which is based in Kanata, Ontario, rose 9 percent, or $1, yesterday to $11.875.

OF BRITAIN SELLING MARCONI INSTRUMENTS UNIT	The General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain said yesterday that it would sell its Marconi Instruments unit to IFR Systems Inc. for $:65 million, or $107 million. Marconi Instruments Ltd. of Britain and its subsidiaries in France, Spain, Germany and the United States are being sold. General Electric P.L.C., a London-based diversified engineering group, is not related to the General Electric Company of the United States. Marconi Instruments, based in Stevenage, England, makes electronic test and measurement systems and equipment. IFR, based in Wichita, Kan., makes communications equipment for the aerospace industry and general-purpose test equipment.

Officer as Successor	The chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest corporation, said today that he would step down in June and would recommend that Paolo Fresco, a vice chairman of the General Electric Company, take his place. The chairman, Cesare Romiti, who took over in 1996 from Giovanni Agnelli, the grandson of the founder of the giant auto group, said on Italian television that he would propose Mr. Fresco as his successor when the Fiat board meets on Jan. 30.
1998-01-04	IN BRIEF	Appointees Retained The new Mayor of White Plains, Joseph M. Delfino, a Republican replacing a Democrat, is retaining most of the city's top personnel.
1997-12-31	U.S. Approves a General Electric Purchase	The General Electric Company got Justice Department approval today for its $600 million purchase of Stewart & Stevenson Services Inc.'s gas turbine unit by agreeing to license a new joint venture to perform maintenance and overhaul work. The agreement resolved Government concerns that the deal would reduce competition in the market for servicing G.E. marine and industrial engines. Right now, Stewart & Stevenson is the only company licensed to work on certain engines.
1997-12-28	IN BRIEF	Question of Ethics An ethics board has been convened in Pelham Manor to consider whether Police Chief Dennis Carroll violated the village ethics code by buying a 1998 Jeep Cherokee from an automobile dealer supplying the Police Department with vehicles, John T. Pierpont, the Village Manager, said.
1997-12-22	G.E. Raises Dividend and Buys Back Stock	The General Electric Company said here Friday that it had increased its stock buyback program by $4 billion, to $17 billion, and raised its dividend 15 percent, signaling confidence to investors increasingly worried about slowing corporate profit. The company also adopted a program to let owners of G.E. shares buy stock directly and avoid brokerage fees.
1997-12-13	Lowering the Credit Fence; Big Players Are Jumping Into the Risky Loan Business	Beatrice Smith has refinanced the mortgage on her small Atlanta home six times in the last decade. As a result, her monthly payment rose from $267 to $417 -- before she defaulted on the loan late last year. A 68-year-old former cleaning woman who lives alone on a monthly Social Security check of $709, Mrs. Smith said she initially refinanced her mortgage so she could pay some overdue bills. But she said she was not sure why she went through with the other ones.
1997-12-11	G.E. Plans to Take a $2 Billion Charge	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings would be reduced by about $2 billion before taxes. The earnings reduction is related to a reorganization of its industrial businesses to offset a $1.6 billion gain from its asset swap with the Lockheed Martin Corporation.

1997-11-25	For White Goods, A World Beckons; But New Markets Are Tough Going	In 1994, the Harvard Business Review featured a long interview with David R. Whitwam, the chief executive of the Whirlpool Corporation, entitled ''The Right Way to Go Global.'' In case anyone doubted the value of Mr. Whitwam's wisdom, a chart accompanied the article, showing how Whirlpool's returns to shareholders in the 1990's were far outdistancing those of the stock market in general.
1997-11-23	For the Screwdriver Challenged, Fix-It Advice by Phone	WHEN Carmela DeBellis accidentally dropped a dust cloth into the lint filter of her dryer, she started calling repair services to come to her Florida home and fix the damage. ''They all wanted $45 or $50 just to come in the door,'' said Mrs. DeBellis, who is 72. ''I thought, 'There's got to be somebody who can help me.' ''
1997-11-10	A Lawyer Minus the Briefcase	Artificial intelligence, or computer-based reasoning and problem solving, has, after years of hype and disappointments, begun to come of age in a few fields marked by clear rules and precise terms. It has been used to help doctors diagnose diseases; it has been used to beat the chess champion of the world. But another goal in artificial intelligence research has proved more elusive. For more than 25 years, experts in artificial intelligence in the United States and Western Europe have tried to figure out how to teach computers to think as lawyers do.
1997-11-04	Market Place; A G.E. deal is good news for Lockheed stock, but why?	GENERAL ELECTRIC is cashing in its investment in Lockheed Martin with a big profit. For reasons that are not entirely clear, Wall Street seems to think that is good news for Lockheed Martin. G.E.'s investment, amounting to 13 percent of the aerospace conglomerate, dates to 1993, when G.E. sold its aerospace subsidiary. It has been an excellent investment for G.E., which has long had a reputation as a savvy investor.
1997-11-04	G.E. Unit Acquires 191 British Properties	MEPC P.L.C., Britain's third-largest property company, has sold 191 small British properties to the GE Capital Services unit of the General Electric Company of the United States for $:300 million ($501 million).
1997-10-21	Executive Jet Venture Is Set	Boeing, General Electric and Executive Jet Inc. are forming a joint venture that will allow businesses and individuals to buy partial shares of new $40 million Boeing business jets to be introduced late next year.

1997-10-03	Varian Seeks a G.E. Unit	Varian Associates Inc. said today that it had offered to purchase GE Medical Systems' radiotherapy service and customer support business for an undisclosed amount of cash. Varian, a high-technology company with interests in medical services and semiconductors, said it expected to close the transaction by the end of the year. GE Medical Systems is a unit of the General Electric Company. GE Medical Systems said the proposed sale included all of its radiotherapy service and customer support operations.
1997-09-26	Babbitt Assails G.E. Over Delay In Ridding Hudson of Chemicals	The Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, speaking from a hilltop overlooking the Hudson River, assailed the General Electric Company today as a corporate giant bent on delaying the restoration of the Hudson River and weakening a Federal program for cleaning toxic sites. Addressing an invited -- and largely sympathetic -- audience, Mr. Babbitt said, ''As we meet here today, General Electric Corporation is leading a lobbying effort in the United States Congress to weaken and gut the very laws that mandate the restoration of this river.''
1997-09-26	CONTAINER SHIP FLEET CONSOLIDATION IS SET	The General Electric Company and Sea Containers Ltd. said yesterday that they would combine their container ship operations to cut costs and increase profits. The joint venture, to be called GE Seaco Services Ltd., will operate one of the world's biggest fleets of marine-freight containers, with 1.2 million metal containers and depots around the world. Sea Containers' class A shares rose $1.375, to $27.375, while its class B shares rose $1.5625, to $27.4325. Shares of G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., fell $1.75, to $66.875. Under the agreement, GE Capital will receive 70 percent of any profit from existing operations and Sea Containers, which has its headquarters in Hamilton, Bermuda, will get 30 percent. The two companies will split profits from additions to the fleet.
1997-09-03	Share Cost, Company Says	The artists who were evicted from a mercury-contaminated building in Hoboken last year should pay part of the estimated $14 million cost of cleaning up the site, the General Electric Company said in court papers filed yesterday. General Electric once made mercury-vapor lamps in the building.
1997-08-20	G.E. TAKES A 20% EQUITY STAKE IN ADVANCED NMR SYSTEMS	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had paid $5.1 million to Advanced NMR Systems Inc. for two magnetic-resonance imaging businesses and a 20 percent stake in the company. G.E. has been working with Advanced NMR, which is based in Wilmington, Mass., to develop the systems, which take high-resolution pictures that are used to diagnose cancer and other diseases.
1997-08-08	G.E. to Sell Back Shares to Broker	The General Electric Company's Capital Services unit said yesterday that it had agreed to sell six million Paine Webber Group Inc. shares back to the brokerage firm for $219 million. The agreement would cut G.E.'s stake in Paine Webber to 23 percent from 31 percent. The purchase price of the Paine Webber stock will be $36.50 a share, below the closing price yesterday of $38.6875, down $2.0625.
1997-08-02	G.E. Executives Get New Posts	The General Electric Company said today that it had named Eugene F. Murphy as a vice chairman, corporate executive officer and a director, amid executive reshuffling. Mr. Murphy, 61, will join John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive, and Paolo Fresco and John D. Opie, vice chairmen, in the executive office.
1997-07-30	New York Joins Inquiry Into River Damage	In a move that could lead to a protracted legal battle between New York State and one of the nation's largest industrial companies, the state will join a Federal effort to determine the costs of environmental damage to the Hudson River from toxic chemicals, Gov. George E. Pataki announced yesterday. The inquiry will also determine if any polluters should be sued to recover those costs.
1997-07-29	Conglomerates Learn to Pick Their Spots	Last month, Textron Inc. said it was selling Speidel, the old-line watch maker. There was nothing wrong with Speidel -- indeed, its earnings had been growing at a steady 5 percent annual clip. It was simply the only consumer-product company left in the Textron stable. ''We want to focus on our core manufacturing and finance businesses,'' James F. Hardymon, Textron's chairman, said. If Royal Little had been alive to hear that, he would have been horrified. After all, Little, the Textron founder who died in 1989, was the granddaddy of the conglomerate movement, that ill-starred push to turn companies into grab bags of unrelated businesses. But while Little's wildly diversified Textron -- a hodgepodge of consumer, military contracting, insurance, textiles and myriad other businesses -- was the epitome of the old-line conglomerate, Mr. Hardymon's pared-down company is the very model of the type that works today.
1997-07-27	WESTCHESTER BRIEFS	Teacher Enters Plea A 37-year-old Scarsdale elementary schoolteacher pleaded not guilty last Monday in Federal District Court in Miami to felony charges of exploitation of a minor, coercion and enticement of a minor and travel to engage in a sexual act with a minor.
1997-07-19	INTELLIGENT ELECTRONICS SELLS COMPUTER BUSINESS TO G.E.	Intelligent Electronics Inc. said yesterday that it had sold most of its direct computer sales business to the General Electric Company for $136 million. Intelligent Electronics said the deal also included some related contracts and assets sold by XLConnect Solutions Inc., an 80 percent owned subsidiary of Intelligent Electronics. Intelligent Electronics, based in Exton, Pa., a reseller of computer equipment, will keep its direct computer sales operations in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis. General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., had 1996 revenues of $79.2 billion. Intelligent Electronics had revenues of $3.4 billion for the year ended on Feb. 1.
1997-07-17	G.E. Disputes a Demolition	An artists' haven that was evacuated last year because of mercury contamination does not have to be demolished, General Electric said yesterday. The company, one of two previous owners, said the building can be cleaned up for use in commercial or industrial purposes. G.E. said it would challenge a recommendation by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency that the building be torn down.
1997-07-12	Patent Fights Aplenty for M.R.I. Pioneer	Is Raymond V. Damadian's story just another David-and-Goliath tale? Not really. For the analogy to work, David's arsenal would have had to include far more than a single well-aimed stone. For more than a decade, Dr. Damadian's tiny Fonar Corporation, which makes magnetic resonance imaging machines, has slung patent infringement lawsuits against Hitachi, Johnson & Johnson, Philips Electronics, Siemens and the mega-Goliath of them all, General Electric. Why? Because Dr. Damadian's name is on the patent that forms the scientific basis for modern M.R.I. machines, but far more of the machines carry those familiar corporate brands.
1997-07-11	G.E. Profit Up Despite Troubles	Despite financial trouble at one of its big investment holdings and a lost patent infringement case, the General Electric Company announced earnings yesterday that exceeded analysts' expectations for the second quarter. G.E.'s net income was up 13.1 percent, to $2.16 billion, or 66 cents a share, from $1.91 billion, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the average estimate of 65 cents a share from analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. International. G.E.'s shares rose $1.0625, to $69.50, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
1997-07-10	E.P.A. Says Raze Building To Curb Risks	About five years ago, a little colony of painters, sculptors, musicians and other artists had a grand vision for an old factory in downtown Hoboken, N.J.: a SoHo West. Their dream was to convert its five floors into apartments and lofts where they could live and work without the overbearing housing costs of Manhattan's SoHo. The dream started crumbling in late 1995, when the last of the 16 families who bought apartments in the former factory on Grand Street started ripping up floorboards to install new tile in a fifth-floor apartment and discovered pools of mercury. Soon afterward, as one of the investors, Steve Keough, recalled, environmental workers in ''moon suits'' arrived to conduct a battery of tests, which showed that the building was contaminated by mercury.
1997-04-27	Bayman Caught in Net Of the Taxman	THERE are times when the ocean surface suddenly begins to roll and, as the men out on the water like to say, the sea grows. It means that tomorrow's conditions may be too rough for fishing, that all they can do is repair their gear and wait. These days, that familiar resignation comes to Dan King even on land. Mr. King is a Long Island bayman, a dwindling breed of fishermen who have taken their share of spills in turbulent waters. A couple of years ago, however, it seemed as if things had been set right for the baymen. They realize now that they should have known better; after all, a fisherman's life is unpredictable by nature.
1997-04-18	Rights Group Presses Drive on U.S. Makers of Land-Mine Parts	A prominent human rights group identified dozens of American companies today that have produced components used to make land mines, and said it had obtained promises from 17 of them that they would not let their products be used in the future. The group, Human Rights Watch, said companies that refused to make a similar pledge, including General Electric, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, would become the targets of a campaign that might include consumer boycotts.
1997-04-16	GENERAL ELECTRIC ADDS LOCKHEED MARTIN MEDICAL UNIT	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had bought the Lockheed Martin Corporation's medical imaging business for an undisclosed price to expand its ability to store and transmit X-ray and other images electronically. The business, Medical Imaging Systems, makes equipment that stores and sends pictures from X-rays, magnetic resonance and computed tomography. G.E.'s medical systems business has annual revenue of about $4 billion and more than 15,000 employees. Shares of G.E. rose $2.875 yesterday, to $102.875; Lockheed Martin rose 87.5 cents, to $83.125.
1997-04-11	G.E. Posts 10.5% Profit Gain, In Line With Analyst Forecasts	The General Electric Company said today that earnings rose 10.5 percent in the first quarter, lifted by double-digit profit growth at six divisions, including aircraft engines, power systems and GE Capital Services. Analysts said the company's push to increase servicing of the jet engines, power-generating turbines and other equipment it sells was paying off.
1997-04-10	Dow and G.E. Resolve Suit On Theft of Trade Secrets	Scarcely a week after it filed a lawsuit accusing the General Electric Company of ''systematically and aggressively'' hiring employees privy to trade secrets, the Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that the two companies had reached an ''amicable resolution'' of the matter. Details of the settlement were not disclosed, but both Dow and General Electric said no financial consideration was involved.
1997-04-06	A Scoundrel or a Scapegoat?	HERE is an oversized desk calendar, used by many of his fellow employees, detailing transactions that are now described as fraudulent. And there is a taped telephone call in which a boss proposed to ''window dress'' the company's balance sheet. And there is an auditors' report that raised no alarm. In a case that has produced a mountain of evidence, these are only fragments. Still, they are enough to give hope to Joseph Jett, a pariah on Wall Street.
1997-04-05	France Rejects G.E. of Britain	France said today that it had rejected the General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain as a prime bidder for the state's 58 percent stake in Thomson-CSF, saying that allowing the British company to control the maker of military electronics would be contrary to ''essential interests of national security.'' The move leaves only the bid by the Lagardere Groupe and a joint bid by Alcatel Alsthom S.A. and the Dassault Aviation Group.
1997-04-05	COMPANY BRIEFS	GENERAL ELECTRIC CO., Fairfield, Conn., agreed to buy the Tridom satellite communications unit from AT&T for an undisclosed sum. NUCO2 INC., Stuart, Fla., agreed to buy the retail carbon-dioxide fountain beverage business from the BOC Group P.L.C., Surrey, England. Terms were not disclosed.
1997-04-02	Dow Charges G.E. Hired Workers Privy To Its Secrets	The Dow Chemical Company sued the General Electric Company today, accusing it of ''systematically and aggressively'' hiring Dow employees privy to trade secrets, the latest in a series of moves by American companies to prevent important officials from going to work for competitors. In the lawsuit filed in state court in Pontiac, a Detroit suburb, Dow accused General Electric of hiring 14 engineers and sales executives from Dow's plastics division over the last two years and putting them to work at similar tasks. Chief Judge Edward Sosnick of the Michigan Circuit Court for Oakland County immediately granted a temporary restraining order barring General Electric from using any trade secrets that it might have obtained from the former Dow employees.
1997-03-29	Snapple Is Just the Latest Case Of Mismatched Reach and Grasp	The Quaker Oats Company's $1.4 billion debacle with Snapple only proves that the well-trod merger road has been paved with unrealized synergies and executive hubris, experts in mergers and acquisitions say. The oatmeal king is in good company when it comes to hailing an acquisition as a quick and brilliant way to increase earnings, only to see it collapse amid red ink and clashing corporate cultures. It has happened to corporate giants and high-technology start-ups alike, including I.B.M., Xerox, General Motors, Sony, General Electric and Novell.
1997-03-18	G.E. of Britain Wins Submarine Contract	The General Electric Company. P.L.C. and partners that include Rolls-Royce P.L.C. won a contract yesterday worth almost $:2 billion ($3.2 billion) to build three British nuclear missile submarines, ending 15 months of talks over price. The Ministry of Defense said in December 1995 that it would award the contract to the Marconi military electronics unit of the British G.E., picking it over the VSEL shipyard as prime contractor. The ministry had held up formal signing of the contract until the price was agreed.
1997-03-18	G.E. Counters on Lawsuit	The General Electric Company charged in a lawsuit Friday that a group of artists had only themselves to blame for losing their investments in a mercury-contaminated factory they converted into lofts in 1993. The artists, who were forced to move out last year, sued G.E. to regain their losses, claiming the company was responsible because it made mercury vapor lamps there until it sold the building in 1948. But on Friday, G.E. filed a countersuit in Federal District Court dividing the blame between the artists, who knew of the contamination before they moved in, and the man who sold the building to the artists. Earlier this month, Federal officials ordered G.E. to pay the living costs of the 16 families who had to move.
1997-03-13	G.E. Chief's Total '96 Pay: $30 Million	John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company, was paid $6.3 million in salary and bonus last year, an 18.4 percent increase over his 1995 cash compensation of $5.32 million, a company proxy statement disclosed yesterday. Mr. Welch's total compensation last year, including 320,000 stock options, was $30.01 million, a one-third increase from the $22.5 million he earned in 1995, according to calculations by Graef S. Crystal, an executive compensation expert and critic of outsized paychecks for chief executives of publicly traded companies.
1997-03-11	$875 Million Deal Widens G.E.'s Role in Jet Engine Servicing	Seeking to widen its reach in the equipment servicing business, the General Electric Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Greenwich Air Services Inc. and UNC Inc. for $875 million in cash and stock, a move that analysts said would effectively double G.E.'s share of the $28 billion market for servicing jet engines. Under the terms of the transaction, General Electric would pay $530 million, or $31 a share, for Greenwich Air, which is based in Miami. General Electric also obtains the rights to complete Greenwich Air's acquisition, announced last month, of UNC for $345 million, or $15 a share.
1997-03-09	Science, Not Cost, Guides G.E. Policy on Hudson River Cleanup	To the Editor: As you note (editorial, March 2), the issue of what, if anything, to do about the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, bound up in sediments of the upper Hudson River is again at center stage. In 1984 the Environmental Protection Agency said those sediments, which resulted from General Electric's legal discharge of PCB's decades before, posed a ''decreasing threat to public health and the environment.'' The agency rejected dredging as unreliable and potentially catastrophic to the environment.
1997-03-06	G.E. and Others Are Ordered To Pay for Evacuees' Housing	Federal officials today ordered the General Electric Company and other previous operators of a Hoboken loft building to pay the temporary living costs of 16 families who had to be moved out a year ago because of potentially dangerous levels of mercury. As a result, General Electric could have to pay as much as $50,000 a month for the families' housing until an investigation determines the full extent of the contamination and the ultimate fate of the property.
1997-03-03	Teamsters Are Challenging G.E. Chief's Compensation	John F. Welch Jr., one of the most successful and highly compensated chief executives in corporate America, is about to be asked to defend how much he is paid to run the General Electric Company. A shareholder resolution seeking to eliminate a form of deferred compensation for Mr. Welch, G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, will be in the proxy statement that G.E. is expected to mail to shareholders in the next few days.
1997-03-02	The PCB War Heats Up	The ecological recovery of the Hudson River is by now a well-documented success story. What was little more than a 350-mile-long sewer stretching from the Adirondacks to Manhattan's Battery has been transformed over 30 years into a river pulsing with life. There remains, however, one huge blot on this otherwise happy history -- the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, that were discharged into the upper Hudson from two General Electric manufacturing plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls and that now lie on the river bottom. The compounds were banned 20 years ago, but enough escaped into the river to pose a potential cancer risk to humans who eat fish caught in the upper Hudson.
1997-02-12	The Surging Dollar? In U.S., Most Companies Shrug It Off	When the American dollar was soaring a dozen years ago, many American manufacturers warned that their businesses would be severely injured by an influx of cheap Japanese tractors, cars and other imports. The dollar has been soaring again this winter, but this time, the number of American companies expressing alarm has been surprisingly small. In recent days, officials at the Boeing Company, the General Electric Company and the Intel Corporation have dismissed worries about the dollar. Even Caterpillar, which led the complaints in the mid-1980's, has said almost nothing lately about the dollar's surge, although its chairman, Donald V. Fites, indicated some concern last summer.

1996-08-02	ANTITRUST LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST GENERAL ELECTRIC	The Justice Department's antitrust division sued the General Electric Company in a Federal court in Montana yesterday, charging that the company's licensing agreements thwart competition in the market for servicing medical equipment. At issue is whether hospitals and clinics that have licensed G.E.'s proprietary diagnostic software to service their own G.E.-made CAT scanners and medical devices should be allowed to offer similar diagnostic services to other hospitals. The company said its agreements prohibit customers from using its own software to compete with G.E. The Justice Department seeks a ruling banning any limits. Analysts estimated that domestic service contracts, the only segment affected by the suit, account for a few million dollars of the estimated $3.8 billion in sales of G.E.'s medical equipment in 1996.

1996-02-18	In Settling G.E. Landfill Case, New York Joined Mainstream	"To the Editor: Re your Feb. 11 editorial on the environmental settlement between G.E. and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation: For at least 20 years, most states and the Federal Government have settled environmental disputes through ""credit projects"" that benefit the environment rather than funnel penalty dollars into a general fund. This is sound policy. Both sides avoid wasting money and time in litigation. By extending its environmental benefits policy to industry, New York has joined the mainstream."
1996-02-11	A Sweet Deal for General Electric	The General Electric Company is one of New York State's biggest employers, providing 13,000 jobs at 7 major sites. It is also one of state's biggest polluters. According to a state report released last year, its silicone factory at Waterford caused more toxic ground pollution than any other plant in the state for the seventh straight year. As the Pataki administration came into power, the Department of Environmental Conservation was preparing to punish the company for environmental violations at Waterford, including releases of toxic materials into the Hudson River, the ground and the air. Last fall a deal was announced in which General Electric was allowed to make a tax-deductible contribution of $1.5 million toward environmental projects in the region in lieu of fines. Environmental groups, Democrats in the State Legislature and even the Attorney General, Dennis Vacco, criticized the deal, saying G.E. had been let off too easily. They were right.

Analysts have said that G.E. largely ignored Genie, failing to spend enough money to make the service known among consumers. G.E. said it sold Genie because it did not fit with the core business of the company's information services unit, which focuses on serving corporate customers.

1995-12-24	EARNING IT;New Perk: Advice for Your Survivors	"LAST January, Rachel Eines's husband, a mechanic for General Electric, died unexpectedly at age 46. When a packet explaining his benefits arrived, Ms. Eines could not understand the financial and legal jargon. ""I didn't have the state of mind to read through it,"" she said. ""I don't think I'm a stupid person, but it was a little above me."" 

     Her two teen-age children, however, noticed in the material something about a benefit called Survivor Support. So Ms. Eines called G.E. and within days a financial counselor came to visit the family in their Bronx home. ""He was wonderful,"" Ms. Eines said. ""He sat with me and went through line by line like with a child, explaining it to me and telling me what he thought I should do. I'm gushing, but it was really a lifeline."""
1995-12-21	4 Refrigerator Makers Agree to Clarify Ozone-Damage Labels	Shopping for a refrigerator is about to get more informative: if not about the refrigerator itself, then about its impact on the environment. To settle a lawsuit brought by environmentalists, four big refrigerator manufacturers have agreed to re-label their appliances to clarify that their appliances will damage the earth's protective ozone layer to some extent, even though they have no chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, the most common ozone-eating chemicals. Meanwhile, the environmental groups that brought the suit say they will file another, against two manufacturers that still use CFC's, but without, the environmentalists say, the required labels.

Microsoft is expected to pay an estimated $100 million for the half-interest in the channel, which would be renamed since its format would no longer consist of all-talk programming.

1995-11-14	GENERAL ELECTRIC PLANS TO SELL ON-LINE SERVICE	"The General Electric Company plans to sell its struggling Genie on-line service. General Electric Information Services, a unit of G.E., is selling Genie because it does not fit with its core business, which is to allow companies to buy and sell products over its computer network, John Berry, a spokesman for the unit, said yesterday. Genie accounts for about 5 percent of the unit's $700,000 in annual sales, he said. The Wall Street Journal reported the sale plans yesterday. General Electric hired the investment banking firm Allen & Company to find a buyer for Genie. Analysts said Genie, started in 1985, would be a tough sell. ""Genie is a proprietary service without much brand recognition,"" said Gregory Wester, associate director at the Yankee Group, a Boston market research firm. ""To compete in this market, you have to make a significant investment in marketing and in acquiring customers."""

1995-11-04	Talks Seen on CNBC-Dow Jones Linkup Abroad	"Executives at Dow Jones & Company and at the General Electric Company's CNBC have held discussions about merging their cable television services in Europe and Asia, according to several people familiar with the talks. Executives at both companies declined to comment. Both companies have expanded into Europe and Asia with English-language news services, and both are said to be losing money on those operations. The reports that they were considering combining their services has a logic that appeals to some industry analysts, given the cost of starting cable services. ""In an era of global markets, it would make sense to achieve economies of scale,"" said Larry Gerbrandt, a cable analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a consulting firm. But one media executive pointed out that discussions go on continuously. He said that he doubted either company would be willing to give up control of its own services."

She was facing skeptical questioning from her boss, Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell, about her sprawling investigation into charges that the General Electric Company was rigging the prices of industrial diamonds around the world. Mr. Hubbell had received calls from Ben W. Heineman Jr., G.E.'s general counsel and a close friend to many powerful Democrats, pleading that the case be dropped, particularly since the company had persuaded the Government's leading witness, an executive-turned-informant, to sign an affidavit saying he had ""no personal knowledge"" of price-fixing."
1995-10-19	New Refrigerators: Just How Friendly To Ozone Layer?	Turning necessity into a virtue, four big refrigerator manufacturers are crowing that they have helped save the environment by removing chlorofluorocarbons, which destroy the earth's protective ozone layer, from the compressors in their new models. In fact, they must eliminate the chemicals, known as CFC's, because an international treaty decrees that after the end of this year, these compounds cannot be legally produced for use in this country. But the redesigned refrigerators will still damage the ozone because of another chemical the manufacturers have started using in foam insulation for the refrigerator walls, something the companies are not advertising.

It estimated that about 20 propeller blades fell into this category. In addition, the agency ordered inspections for similar blades made by the same company for other types of aircraft. It said that any such blades, manufactured by Hamilton Standard, that had a history of significant repairs should undergo a special ultrasound inspection within their next 10 flights.

Each company would have acquired a 12 percent stake in Nuovo Pignone for an undisclosed amount."

Trump, the developer, has made a successful grab for an aging glass skyscraper on Columbus Circle, and today construction officially begins on his plan to turn the walls of the old Gulf and Western Building into gold. Gold-tinted glass, anyhow. Mr. Trump's well-publicized financial difficulties may have tarnished the lustrous image he enjoyed a decade ago, but his new project seems designed to prove that esthetically at least, he has not lost the tycoon's touch.

1995-06-07	Despite Engine Snag, G.E. Expects 777 to Be on Time	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had encountered a problem in the final development of its version of the jet engine that powers the Boeing Company's new 777, but both companies said they believed they were still on schedule to deliver planes equipped with the GE90 engines to British Airways P.L.C. in September. General Electric said the problem was discovered during so-called bird-ingestion tests, in which the carcass of an eight-pound bird is fired from a cannon into an engine operating at full throttle. Although the GE90's new composite turbine blades and aluminum casing emerged unscathed from the test, there was a greater than anticipated amount of imbalance in the engine afterward, the company said. The cause of the imbalance was found to be the failure of an aluminum part mounted between the blades that has an aerodynamic function.

Analysts said they expected General Electric P.L.C. of Britain, known as G.E.C., to match or top British Aerospace's offer. Last week, Britain's Trade and Industry Secretary, Michael Heseltine, overruled a recommendation from antitrust regulators that G.E.C. be blocked from bidding on the ground that a takeover of VSEL by G.E.C. would limit competition in military shipbuilding. Mr. Heseltine cleared both companies to bid again, and G.E.C. has until June 13 to make a new offer. G.E.C. is not related to General Electric of the United States. (Bloomberg Business News)

Kidder dismissed Mr. Jett last April, charging that he had created $350 million in phony profits for the firm and himself.

Wins in Diamond Price Case	In a stunning victory for the General Electric Company, a Federal judge threw out a criminal case yesterday in which the company was accused of conspiring to fix the world price of industrial diamonds. United States District Judge George C.

Mr. Russell did not attend the meeting, but he testified that Mr. Hiner later told him that during the meeting the ""Europeans wanted pricing stability"" for industrial diamonds."
1994-10-28	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a Federal price-fixing case against the General Electric Company misstated the Justice Department's record in taking criminal antitrust cases to trial.

1994-10-27	Market Place G.E.C.'s chairman may be ready for battle with British Aerospace.	SOMETIME in the next few days, the General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain is expected to make a decision that could have profound ramifications for the British military contracting industry. Lord Weinstock, who has headed G.E.C. for 31 years and built its GEC Marconi division into the nation's second-largest military supplier, is likely to decide whether to start a hostile bid for VSEL P.L.C., a naval shipyard and Britain's leading submarine builder. If he goes ahead with a bid -- and the betting among analysts here is that he will -- Lord Weinstock will be taking on not only VSEL, but the country's biggest arms maker, British Aerospace P.L.C. Ultimately, some industry executives and analysts said, the wrangling over VSEL could lead G.E.C. to make a bid for British Aerospace itself.

(GE,N)	The General Electric Company, a day after announcing a deal to sell Kidder, Peabody & Company, its unprofitable and scandal-ridden brokerage unit, said yesterday that third-quarter earnings rose 13 percent on strong sales growth in most of its businesses. G.E.'s net income rose to $1.37 billion, or 80 cents a share, from $1.21 billion, or 71 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. The profit, a third-quarter record, matched Wall Street estimates. Sales rose almost 9 percent, to $16.15 billion.
1994-10-18	Paine Webber's Plan for Kidder	To make its purchase of Kidder, Peabody & Company successful, the Paine Webber Group is not counting so much on Kidder's highly regarded brokers, strong research department or some of its investment bankers. It is counting more on the favorable terms of the merger and its own own back office, the humdrum systems operation at the heart of any Wall Street firm. Paine Webber's focus on these workmanlike matters is a direct result of the lesson it learned from its last merger, the 1980 purchase of Blythe Eastman Dillon. That purchase was a disaster, and Paine Webber spent much of the 1980's trying to get it right.
1994-10-18	For G.E., Sale Was Fast and Cheap	The General Electric Company got rid of its unpleasant association with Kidder, Peabody sooner than expected and, based on some analysts' estimates, possibly at a smaller loss than had been anticipated. One illustration of just how badly G.E. wanted Kidder off its books was that the deal with the Paine Webber Group was wrapped up less than three weeks after the start of serious talks.
1994-10-17	Paine Webber Reported Near Deal for Kidder	The General Electric Company has agreed in principle to sell the bulk of Kidder, Peabody & Company to the Paine Webber Group for about $670 million in stock, people involved in the negotiations said yesterday.

Talks	Although Ted Turner, chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System Inc., has not publicly acknowledged an interest in acquiring NBC, the television industry has begun assuming that he would like to buy the network from the General Electric Company. But industry experts say Mr. Turner would encounter regulatory and financial obstacles in trying to complete such an acquisition. Indeed, one NBC executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that General Electric and NBC considered Mr. Turner's ambitions so unrealistic that they did not take him to be a serious bidder.
1994-09-26	Snags Reported in Talks On a Disney-NBC Deal	The talks between the General Electric Company and the Walt Disney Company about Disney's possible purchase of NBC have cooled, several people with knowledge of the discussions said yesterday. The stumbling block seems to be Disney's desire to buy all of NBC -- the network, the seven local television stations and its interests in cable television, including CNBC. General Electric has apparently decided that it would prefer to continue owning a majority of NBC, making only 49 percent available to suitors.

""You've got three channels and you watch whatever one comes in that day,"" she said. The place with almost no television suddenly had as much as just about anybody in the world, with the added bonus of perfect reception -- and all free for the first three months. Arietta, a sprawling ""town"" of nearly 500 square miles peopled by 301 scattered souls, about 70 miles northwest of Albany, had become a company's demonstration site for a television technology that beams signals into individual homes by means of umbrella-sized satellite reception dishes."

Some of those people said that Walt Disney's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, might pay as much as $5 billion, yet other media experts believe that is wishful thinking. Representatives at both NBC and Disney declined to comment. Mr. Eisner had been in discussions with NBC's parent, the General Electric Company, to acquire NBC, but apparently the talks ran into difficulties several weeks ago. Disney is believed to have held recent discussions with CBS as well.

One senior executive called it ""the biggest game of musical chairs ever to hit this business."" The only problem with being in the game, added the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, is that ""nobody is really sure how many chairs there are and how many companies really want to sit in them."""
1994-09-07	G.E. Reported To Hire Allen	Allen & Company, the New York investment banking firm, is said to have been hired by the General Electric Company to handle the sale of NBC, the company's television network operation, according to several people with knowledge of the transaction. An executive close to Allen & Company declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for General Electric said she had no information about it and could not comment.
1994-09-06	The Case for a Sale of Kidder	If General Electric is trying to sell NBC, can Kidder, Peabody, the company's troubled investment bank, be far behind? Like the television network, Kidder is a G.E. acquisition that never really worked. And even as reports of G.E.'s efforts to shed NBC trickled out last week, the conventional wisdom on Wall Street was that G.E. would not or could not keep Kidder. There are at least four reasons:
1994-09-02	Converging Interests	There is a basic reason that one, and possibly two, of the broadcast television networks may be close to being sold to companies that operate Hollywood studios: For both buyers and sellers, the time is right, and may never be more so. The broadcast business, once considered shaky, has made a strong financial comeback in the last year. And the owners of the two networks in question, NBC and CBS, have indicated a desire to relinquish control.
1994-09-02	Unsure Reaction to News of Network Talks	With Time Warner Inc. and the General Electric Company still declining to comment on their discussions to sell all or part of the NBC television network to Time Warner, Wall Street was uncertain how to react yesterday. One of the few certainties, analysts said, is that Time Warner has a strategic need for such a deal to protect the television programming revenue it receives from its Warner Brothers unit. Network programming represented perhaps $100 million of Time Warner's $1.4 billion of operating profits last year.
1994-08-13	Settlement by Marietta	The Martin Marietta Corporation will pay $6.3 million to settle allegations that the General Electric Company's aerospace division near Philadelphia had inflated the cost of Government contract proposals, officials said yesterday. Martin Marietta acquired the division, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa., in 1993. Martin Marietta was not accused of wrongdoing, but the payment will clear it of liability for fraud, the Justice Department said. Prosecutors charged the division with inflating the estimates of labor hours in proposals for Government contracts. Fictitious hours were added to protect G.E. from unforeseen developments like labor shortages, rate increases or production difficulties, the department said.
1994-08-02	G.E. Picks Berlin For Credit-Card Ads	The General Electric Company selected Berlin Wright Cameron in New York yesterday to handle advertising for its G.E. Rewards credit-card account, which had been at Hal Riney & Partners of New York and San Francisco for the last two years. Berlin Wright was awarded the account, with billings estimated at $10 million, without a review. A campaign is expected to begin in the fall.
1994-08-01	G.E. Succeeded With Hungary Venture	"To the Editor: ""G.E. Finds Tough Going in Hungary"" (Business Day, July 25), which describes the birth pains when General Electric bought Tungsram, Hungary's largest industrial company, in 1989 after the Iron Curtain fell, does not reflect today's Tungsram."
1994-08-01	BBDO New York Chosen for G.E. Job	The General Electric Company has selected BBDO New York to handle the consolidated media planning and buying portion of its account, which had been handled by more than 30 agencies. The account involves more than 30 company activities, including the corporate, appliances, lighting and financial services divisions, but not the NBC unit. Although billings were not disclosed, Advertising Age estimated them at $50 million.
1994-07-25	G.E. Finds Tough Going in Hungary	Five years ago, amid handshakes and grins, the General Electric Company agreed to acquire Tungsram, a maker of lighting products and one of Hungary's industrial gems, in a deal that many believed would show other leading Western corporations how to turn Communist-run enterprises into money makers. Almost immediately, other ambitious American companies took notice of General Electric's investment in Eastern Europe, and it became a beacon of hope for Hungary's workers and Government leaders.
1994-07-22	More Kidder Resignations Are Expected in Jett Case	More high-level resignations are expected soon at Kidder, Peabody & Company, the troubled brokerage firm owned by the General Electric Company, people close to the two companies said yesterday. The resignations could come even before the findings of a three-month internal investigation into the Joseph Jett case are made public in a week or two. Mr. Jett was dismissed as head of the firm's government-bond trading desk in April and accused by the company of fabricating $350 million in profits with phony trades.
1994-07-21	Columbia and Developer Plan Rental of Midtown Office Tower	Columbia University, which last year received the office tower at 570 Lexington Avenue as a gift from the General Electric Company, is negotiating an agreement to have the building renovated and rented as office space. The plan calls for the Mendik Company, a developer in New York, and the Quantum North America Realty Fund, which the financier George Soros operates, to renovate and rent the 50-story building at 51st Street. In return, Mendik and Quantum will receive unannounced degrees of equity in the building.
1994-07-20	G.E. Earnings Up 14% Despite Some Setbacks	The General Electric Company, the nation's fifth-largest industrial concern, reported yesterday that its profits jumped 14 percent in the second quarter, as strong gains in many of its manufacturing and financial operations offset weakness at NBC, G.E. Aircraft Engines and Kidder, Peabody, its troubled brokerage subsidiary. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., said its second-quarter net income totaled $1.52 billion, or 89 cents a share, up from $1.33 billion, or 78 cents a share, in the comparable period last year. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $16.2 billion from $14.76 billion.
1994-07-19	FORMER G.E. EXECUTIVE PLEADS GUILTY IN FRAUD CASE	A former executive for the General Electric Company admitted his role yesterday in a scheme to divert $11 million in United States military aid meant for Israel. Herbert B. Steindler, 55, of Melbourne Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Government, among other charges. Mr. Steindler also agreed to forfeit $1.7 million, prosecutors said. The former G.E. international sales manager, who was dismissed in 1991, faces up to 35 years in prison and $22 million in fines. Mr. Steindler was indicted in March with Rami Dotan, a former Israeli air force general. They were charged with diverting the aid between 1984 and 1990 from Pentagon contracts for jet engines. Mr. Dotan is serving a 13-year prison term in Israel.
1994-07-18	Undercover at G.E. -- A special report; F.B.I. Inquiry on Jet Engines: New Jolt to Company Image	Dawn was just a streak in the sky when Ian Johnson drove into the lot behind a pizza parlor last winter and waited anxiously for Stephen Kosky, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In a ritual repeated each morning, the agent removed the tape from a tiny recorder hidden on Mr. Johnson's body and replaced it with a fresh one. An hour later, after returning home for breakfast, Mr. Johnson, his palms sweaty, would flash his company identification card at the guard at Gate 42 and walk into the General Electric Company's sprawling aircraft engine plant at Evendale, Ohio, a few miles north of here. There, he secretly recorded dozens of conversations with fellow engineers and supervisors over six months last winter and spring.
1994-07-14	COMPANY NEWS: Laughing at G.E.'s Expense; Honored Leader Jokes About Trading Scandal	John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of the General Electric Company, may be under fire these days, but he has not lost his sense of humor, judging from the remarks he made at a black-tie dinner on Tuesday night. The 58-year-old executive has long been one of the most highly regarded managers in Corporate America, but his reputation has been tarnished by the recent trading scandal at G.E.'s brokerage subsidiary, Kidder, Peabody & Company. G.E. took a $210 million charge against earnings in the first quarter, after it was said that Joseph Jett, a Kidder, Peabody trader, had created $350 million in phantom profits.
1994-07-02	G.E. IN DEAL TO PURCHASE GTE SATELLITE NETWORK	"The General Electric Company has signed a definitive agreement to buy the satellite communications network of the GTE Corporation. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Under the agreement, which was announced Thursday, GE American Communications Inc., a unit of the GE Capital Corporation based in Princeton, N.J., said it would buy all seven satellites and related ground stations owned by GTE. The purchase will double the number of satellites owned by the General Electric unit, making it a leading supplier of space communications in the domestic market. ""We are excited about the expanded service capabilities this acquisition will enable us to offer our customers,"" Gary C. Wendt, president and chief executive of GE Capital, said in a statement."
1994-07-01	G.E. to Buy 7 Satellites	The General Electric Company signed a definitive agreement yesterday to buy the satellite communications network of the GTE Corporation. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
1994-06-28	Conseco Bid For Kemper Is Accepted	The directors of the Kemper Corporation voted unanimously Sunday evening to accept a $3.2 billion purchase offer made Thursday by Conseco Inc., a life insurance company based in Carmel, Ind. The agreement calls for holders of each Kemper share to collect $56 in cash and $11 worth of Conseco common stock. That offer exceeded an earlier $60-a-share cash offer by the General Electric Company, whose bid caused Kemper to put itself up for sale. G.E. withdrew its offer after the Conseco bid.
1994-06-25	Kidder Given $550 Million in New Capital	Kidder, Peabody & Company has received $550 million in new capital since April to bolster its finances, Tony Zehnder, a spokesman at Kidder, said yesterday. The 129-year-old securities firm received $200 million from the finance unit of the General Electric Company, its parent company, Mr. Zehnder said. It also received $350 million from its holding company, Kidder, Peabody Group Inc., which borrowed the money from banks, he said.
1994-06-24	Life Insurer Bests G.E. On Kemper	Conseco Inc., an upstart life insurer, challenged the General Electric Company to a bidding war for the Kemper Corporation yesterday, but General Electric decided to retreat from the field. Conseco offered yesterday morning to buy Kemper for $67 a share in cash and stock, or about $3.2 billion, topping General Electric's all-cash offer of $60 a share. By midafternoon, General Electric had withdrawn its bid, giving no reason for the move.
2014-01-02	G.E. Ousts Kidder, Peabody Chief	In an effort to restore the shine to Kidder, Peabody & Company's tarnished image, General Electric yesterday replaced Michael A. Carpenter, Kidder's chief executive, with two senior executives from G.E. John F. Welch Jr., chairman of G.E., said the decision to replace Mr. Carpenter, a close friend, was not the result of any findings in its continuing investigation into a Treasury bond trading scandal at Kidder involving Joseph Jett, a former top trader at the firm. Instead, he said, the change was needed to rebut the perception in the financial markets that the episode with Mr. Jett and Kidder's recent losses in mortgage securities were raising questions about Kidder's future.
1994-06-16	G.E. Gave Kidder a $200 Million Infusion	The General Electric Company injected $200 million late last month into Kidder, Peabody & Company, its brokerage subsidiary, to offset capital losses caused by the discovery of fictitious trades at the firm, Kidder executives said yesterday. That infusion of fresh money, from GE Capital Services, another G.E. subsidiary, replenished 95 percent of a $210 million loss of equity at Kidder, according to a memorandum sent earlier this week to the firm's clients.
1994-06-03	Part of G.E. Account Is Put in Review	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had placed in review the media planning and buying portion of its account, now handled by 33 agencies, in order to consolidate those duties at a single shop. The review involves more than 30 company activities, including the corporate, appliances, lighting and financial services divisions, but not NBC. Though G.E. would not discuss billings, Advertising Age estimated them at potentially as much as $50 million.
1994-05-28	G.E. Shareholders Sue Kidder	Kidder, Peabody & Company and its former trader of government bonds, Joseph Jett, have been sued by shareholders of the General Electric Company, Kidder's parent, in connection with Kidder's contention that Mr. Jett fabricated more than $350 million in trading profits. Kidder dismissed Mr. Jett in April after the firm said it had discovered trading irregularities.
1994-05-10	No Fight Expected for Kemper	The General Electric Company will probably not face any competition to its revised offer for the Kemper Corporation, analysts said yesterday. The GE Capital Corporation, the finance subsidiary of General Electric, raised its cash bid for Kemper over the weekend to $60 a share, or about $1.99 billion, from $55 a share.
1994-05-09	With New Bid by G.E., Kemper Invites Buyers	Faced with a $190 million increase in a hostile takeover bid from the General Electric Company and the likelihood of losing a crucial proxy fight, the Kemper Corporation yesterday formally put itself up for sale. The action, which Kemper's management and board had resisted for months, opened the door for a bidding war involving G.E. and other potential suitors for the insurance and investment company, which is based in the Chicago suburb of Long Grove, Ill.
1994-05-06	COMPANY BRIEFS	GENERAL ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL AND POWER SYSTEMS, Schenectady, N.Y., a unit of General Electric Co., received a $50 million contract from Raytheon Construction Inc., Lexington, Mass., to provide power generation equipment for a combined-cycle co-generation facility.
1994-04-20	G.E.'s Bright New Idea: A Seven-Year Light Bulb	A long-life household light bulb designed to last about seven years in normal use will soon reach the market, the General Electric Company's lighting division said yesterday. The bulb, known in the industry as an E-lamp because it uses electronic controls, will go on sale in Europe within weeks and in the United States before the end of the year, G.E. said.
1994-04-19	G.E. Shaken by Phantom Trades at Kidder Unit	Just when the General Electric Company thought that it had put its investment banking subsidiary, Kidder, Peabody & Company, on solid footing, a seemingly rogue bond trader caused it to take a $350 million pretax charge to its first-quarter earnings. Kidder had rebounded since a 1986 insider-trading scandal embroiled the firm, posting strong profits in 1992 and 1993. The report of the phantom trades, however, comes as a challenge to John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's strong-willed chairman and a believer in tight, nearly obsessive internal controls.
1994-04-18	Kidder Reports Fraud and Ousts a Top Trader	Kidder, Peabody & Company said yesterday that it dismissed its chief government bond trader during the weekend after it had uncovered fraudulent trading apparently intended to inflate the brokerage firm's profits and the trader's 1993 bonus. As a result, Kidder said $350 million in profits it recorded in the last year never existed. To rectify its accounts, Kidder's parent, the General Electric Company, will take a $210 million charge to its first-quarter earnings, which will be announced this week. Kidder said no customers lost money because of the fraud.
1994-04-16	Army Contract to G.E.	The General Electric Company has received a $671.3 million Army order for engines used by Blackhawk and Apache helicopters, as well as engines used by Navy transport helicopters.
1994-04-12	3M Will Pay $325 Million To Settle Implant Suits	The Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Company announced today that it had agreed to contribute $325 million to a fund to compensate women who received silicone breast implants. The agreement leaves the General Electric Company as the last major holdout against the huge legal settlement, which is now worth more than $4.3 billion, according to lawyers for the women who have sued, contending that the implants are responsible for medical problems.
1994-04-08	COMPANY NEWS	ALLIED SIGNAL INC., Morristown, N.J., said its aerospace division had received a 10-year contract valued at $280 million to supply the General Electric Co. with jet engine components. ASA INTERNATIONAL LTD., has agreed to acquire Profitkey International Inc. of Salem, N.H., for an undisclosed amount of stock.
1994-04-07	G.E. Says Earnings Are Up	The General Electric Company said today that its first-quarter earnings rose as much as 11 percent a share from last year, bolstered by excellent profit in its finance and brokerage businesses. G.E., one of the world's 10 largest industrial companies, also said it expected record earnings in 1994.
1994-03-21	G.E. Locomotive Deal	Southern Pacific Lines, a unit of the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation, plans to buy 100 locomotives from the General Electric Company for about $135 million. Southern Pacific Lines, the nation's sixth-largest railroad, with 15,000 miles of track serving 15 states, said last week that it also planned to lease three locomotives from the Morrison Knudsen Corporation.
1994-03-19	Breast Implant Companies Dispute Claim of Settlement	"Six months ago, lawyers for women who had silicone breast implants and for the companies that made the devices announced that they had reached a tentative agreement on a $4.75 billion fund to compensate the women for health problems. But negotiations continued. Then, late on Thursday, it was again announced that a settlement had been reached. ""It's a done deal,"" said the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs' negotiating team, Stanley Chesley"
1994-03-18	Kemper Board Rebuffs G.E. On $2.2 Billion Takeover Bid	"The board of the Kemper Corporation formally rejected the General Electric Company's $2.2 billion takeover bid today, as expected. But analysts said the rebuff was just a prelude to further negotiations, a higher offer and an eventual deal -- if not with G.E., then with another acquirer. Kemper's rejection of the unsolicited $55-a-share offer was conveyed in a blunt letter faxed from David B. Mathis, Kemper's chairman and chief executive, to John F. Welch Jr., his counterpart at G.E. Mr. Mathis stressed Kemper's desire to remain an independent stock brokerage, life insurance and asset management company and accused G.E. of trying to steal Kemper with a ""low-ball proposal."""
1994-03-17	Kemper Board Discusses Hostile G.E. Bid	The board of the Kemper Corporation met last night -- a day earlier than planned -- to begin discussions over the merits of a hostile takeover bid by the General Electric Company. Kemper, the asset management and life insurance company based in Long Grove, Ill., has so far rebuffed a $55-a-share, or $2.2 billion, bid by GE Capital, General Electric's financial arm, saying it wishes to remain independent.
1994-03-16	Market Place; Kemper Spurns the G.E. Bid, But Shareholders May Not	The men running the Kemper Corporation think they deserve time to prove that they have turned around a lumbering giant. But they may not get the opportunity because while the bid from the General Electric Company on Monday was declared unpalatable by Kemper executives, it may look quite inviting to Kemper shareholders, making a hostile move by G.E. a lot easier. Until the offer by G.E. was disclosed, Kemper stock was trading well below where it was in late 1989 and there had been an erosion of shareholder loyalty. At the same time, Kemper was watching its market share decline in some of its most important businesses.
1994-03-15	GE Capital Makes $2.1 Billion Bid for Kemper	"GE Capital, the highly profitable financial arm of the General Electric Company, announced yesterday that it was offering $2.1 billion in cash for the Kemper Corporation, a mutual fund and securities company, whose management is not eager to sell. Kemper's chairman, David B. Mathis, had rejected GE Capital's merger overtures following a Jan. 26 meeting between executives of the two companies, but GE Capital is pressing forward with its offer. In announcing publicly yesterday that GE Capital would pay $55 a share or possibly more for Kemper, its chairman, Gary C. Wendt, said he hoped Kemper's board would reconsider. Mr. Wendt described the attitude of Kemper's management as saying the company, based in Long Grove, Ill., ""was not for sale at any price."""
1994-03-04	Corrections	An article and headline on Feb. 23 about allegations of a kickback scheme in the space program referred imprecisely in some copies to the criminal charges filed.

The General Electric Company, which traces its roots to Thomas Edison's original incandescent bulb, is teaming up with Motorola Lighting to produce a new generation of light bulbs. The new lamps will use substantially less electricity and will have much longer life than current bulbs, company officials say.

P. Morgan & Company. But neither the General Electric Company nor the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, both of which are direct and indirect shareholders in Banesto, would say late last week how close they were to deciding whether to file suit against the bank.
1994-02-23	U.S. Accuses 9 in Kickback Scheme at Space Agency	Federal prosecutors today accused eight people who work for either NASA or three of its contractors, as well as a partner in a consulting firm headed by a former space agency administrator, of taking part in bribery and kickback schemes at the Johnson Space Center. The Justice Department said agents posing as executives paid bribes to win a place aboard the space shuttle for a fake device to detect and crush kidney stones during space missions. The ailment is thought to be a risk on long flights.
1994-02-18	U.S. Indicts G.E. and De Beers in Diamond Pricing	A Federal grand jury indicted the General Electric Company, De Beers Centenary A.G. and two European businessmen today on a single count of conspiring to raise and fix prices in the half-billion-dollar-a-year worldwide industrial diamond industry. The two companies control about four-fifths of the international market for industrial diamonds, which are mainly produced synthetically from carbon under extremely high pressure and temperature, and which are embedded in saws and drills for use in cutting stone and concrete.
1994-01-21	GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.	The General Electric Company reported yesterday that its earnings rose a little more than 10 percent in the fourth quarter, to $1.477 billion, or $1.73 a share. The gains were led by G.E.'s appliance, financial services, plastics and electrical generating equipment divisions, and came despite the loss of income from the aerospace business, which was sold during 1993. Revenue for the quarter increased 12 percent, to $18.1 billion.
1994-01-03	'92 NBC Talks Are Reported	Paramount Communications Inc. came very close to acquiring NBC from its parent, the General Electric Company, in 1992, but the deal fell apart at the last moment, according to an article in the February issue of Vanity Fair. In April 1992, the chairman of Paramount, Martin S. Davis, and the chairman of General Electric, John F. Welch Jr., were close enough to a deal that Paramount was writing press releases. But there was a sticking point: regulatory approval for the transfer of NBC's television stations to Paramount.

Are Rehired	Six of 11 workers who said they were dismissed from a General Electric factory in Mexico for trying to organize an independent labor union will be rehired, union leaders say. The six were let go from the Compania Armadora electric motor plant in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, just weeks after the North American Free Trade Agreement was approved in the United States Congress on Nov. 17.
1993-12-21	Ameritech and G.E. in Deal	The Ameritech Corporation announced an agreement today to invest $472 million in the information services unit of the General Electric Company. It was the latest investment by a regional Bell operating company outside its core telephone business. Ameritech, based here, plans to buy a four-year note in GE Information Services, a fast-growing unit that had sales of $600 million last year.
1993-12-09	Government Denies Bonus to Nuclear Site Manager	In a rebuke of its largest contractor, the Energy Department said yesterday that Westinghouse would receive no bonus for its management of the Hanford nuclear reservation for the six months ending Sept. 30. It was the first time since the fee system was instituted at the Washington State site in 1976 that a contractor did not receive a bonus. The department's decision comes in the aftermath of a worker's death after a steam pipe ruptured. During the same period, a technician working at a waste tank filled with hazardous material tied a rope around a rock and lowered it down a pipe to try to clear a blockage; the result was additional radiation exposure, among other problems. The technician was apparently frustrated with safety procedures.

Zehnder, a spokesman for GE Capital, confirmed the sale but declined to disclose the purchase price or the amount of receivables that his company had bought. After the sale, the Exxon credit card will continue to exist, but it will be serviced by GE Capital, a unit of the General Electric Company. Exxon said that the sale would affect 400 employees.
1993-11-19	U.S. Will Allow Computer Sale To Court China	In a good-will gesture toward China, the Clinton Administration has agreed to sell it a sophisticated $8 million supercomputer, senior Administration officials said today. The decision is part of the Administration's strategy to embrace rather than isolate China despite disagreements over human rights, weapons proliferation and trade. The Clinton Administration is determined to grab an ever-larger share of China's market, the fastest growing in the world, and reduce a trade deficit that could exceed the one with Japan by the end of the decade. G.E. Stands to Profit Even more significant for American business, the Administration has also decided to lift the ban on important components for China's nuclear power plants, like generators, senior Commerce Department officials said. That could mean billions of dollars in sales for the General Electric Company, which has begun to break into China's burgeoning nuclear power market.
1993-10-29	GENERAL ELECTRIC OF BRITAIN MAKES OFFER FOR FERRANTI	The General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain has offered to buy Ferranti International, a debt-stricken military contractor, for $:150.1 million ($225 million). The acquisition would include Ferranti's $:140 million of bank debt and a nominal offer of one penny a share for its outstanding stock. Ferranti recommended shareholders accept the offer because the alternative would be bankruptcy. Ferranti was hard hit by cutbacks in Western military budgets after the end of the cold war. It was also the victim of fraud when it acquired International Signal and Control Group in 1987. The fraud was not discovered until 1989. G.E.C. is not related to the General Electric Company of the United States.
1993-10-13	GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. (N)	The General Electric Company said yesterday that 11 of its remaining 12 business units had improved earnings for the third quarter, with 7 reporting double-digit increases. Only the aircraft engines unit reported a decline in profit, which the company said was expected. As a result, the company reported an earnings increase of 8.6 percent for the period, despite the sale last November of its aerospace business, which earned $114 million for the third quarter last year. The business was sold to the Martin Marietta Corporation as part of a consolidation of defense-related operations.
1993-10-01	Martin Marietta to Eliminate 11,000 Jobs	The Martin Marietta Corporation, which last year bought the General Electric Company's aerospace electronics division, said yesterday that it would close 12 production sites and eliminate 11,000 jobs nationwide this year to consolidate the two businesses. The move, which had been expected for months, is the latest sign that the pain and layoffs of a shrinking weapons industry are far from finished. The announcement came the same day large layoffs were announced in the airline and hazardous-waste disposal industries. [ Page D3. ]
1993-09-24	GPA and Its Lenders Agree On a Rescue by GE Capital	The GPA Group, the debt-ridden Irish aircraft-leasing company, said today that after months of negotiations, it had reached agreement with its lenders and other financial backers on a previously announced rescue plan. The plan would leave GPA under the effective control of the General Electric Company's GE Capital subsidiary, which would hold an option to buy a stake of about two-thirds of the leasing company.

Madden is returning to Kidder, Peabody & Company, four years after the investment banker left the firm while it was in turmoil as its owner, the General Electric Company, began to exercise more control. Kidder said yesterday that Mr. Madden was returning with a plan to use the G.E. connection for Kidder's benefit.
1993-09-05	An American Workplace, After the Deluge	This is the city where the General Electric Company was born a century ago. But its factories this Labor Day invite suspicions that the company might not be here much longer. Weeds grow in the fissured asphalt of the plants G.E. has closed around town, and most gates to the ones that remain open are chained shut because the gatekeepers have been dismissed. At G.E.'s main site here, the green stuff bordering the visitors' parking lot is not grass but a low-maintenance plastic coated with grit. G.E.-Lynn has been reduced to a single business, making engines for small jet aircraft, and the work force here has been halved since the mid-1980's, to 6,200, with more cuts to come soon.
1993-09-02	The Unobtrusive Kitchen	A KITCHEN where appliances are nearly invisible is high style nowadays. Following this trend is General Electric's new Monogram built-in microwave oven (in picture, below), which can slip flush into any cabinet without additional space around it and has a pull-down door. The Monogram ($749 to $1,049) also comes as a convection or combination oven. Information is available from (800) 626-2000. Next year, Whirlpool plans to introduce a chlorofluorocarbon-free refrigerator that will cause less ozone depletion than current models. Recent reports that the buildup of chlorofluorocarbons has slowed worldwide should encourage many who are looking for ways they can decrease ozone-layer damage.
1993-08-31	GE Capital Set to Rescue GPA Group	The GPA Group P.L.C. expects to complete a deal within a few days under which it would be rescued from its financial difficulties by a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, aviation industry executives said today. The executives said that on completion of the deal, to which the companies agreed in principle in May, Tony Ryan, GPA's founder and chairman, would relinquish his duties overseeing the finances of the aircraft-leasing company. But they said he would be appointed chairman of a new company, GE Capital Aviation Management Ltd., which would be in charge of the commercial aircraft-leasing activities of both GPA and GE Capital, which is based in Stamford, Conn.

Engine Unit To Let 4,000 Go	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it would trim 4,000 jobs from its jet engine division to help it weather a slump in orders from military and commercial aircraft manufacturers. At least half the cutbacks will take place at GE Aircraft Engines' headquarters in Cincinnati, and most will be made by the end of the year. The rest will be scattered throughout the division's operations worldwide.

1993-08-13	G.E. to Pay Fishermen Over Polluted Striped-Bass Waters	Ending an eight-year fight, the General Electric Corporation has agreed to compensate New York commercial fishermen for income they lost because of PCB contamination of Hudson River spawning grounds for striped bass. Under an agreement reached out of court Wednesday night, G.E. will pay up to a total of $7 million to 300 to 400 fishermen, including as many as 150 eastern Long Island baymen, who can prove they lost income as a result of a state ban on fishing for striped bass from 1986 to 1990 in marine waters off Long Island, and since 1976 in the Hudson River.
1993-07-28	Report on Trade Treaty Is Critical of Companies	A report scheduled to be released in Washington on Wednesday accuses several major American companies that are staunch supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement of having shifted thousands of jobs to Mexico, consistently violated workers' rights here and used Mexican plants to make products that have been banned in the United States. The corporations named in the report by the Institute for Policy Studies are part of a pro-treaty lobbying group called USA*NAFTA. Officials at the organization's headquarters in Washington had not seen the report and declined to comment. Corporations Deny Accusations But some of the corporations named in the study denied the accusations or accused the authors of repeating old claims that had been refuted. They include a charge that the General Motors Corporation plant in Matamoros, Mexico, is dumping into an open canal a toxic chemical called methylene chloride at more than 216,000 times the allowed American standard, and another chemical called xylene at 6,400 times the rate allowed in the United States.

The contract calls for the company to build a 2,800-megawatt combined-cycle power station in Yokohama, Japan, to begin commercial service in the mid-1990's.
1993-07-18	Managing by Team Is Not Always as Easy as It Looks	"The theory is simple: create spirited teams of workers with different skills from different departments and give them the power to develop a product, manage a business, improve a system, or plan their own work schedules. When employees get control of their own destinies, it says, they will work faster, smarter and with an eye toward profitability. 

The experts call it team management, and in the last decade many businesses have tried it. But the majority are still grappling to produce crackerjack work teams. Turf battles between rival departments are common. Traditional managers schooled in rigid hierarchies balk at letting employees make decisions. Without the support of top management, teams often fall apart. And teams that report to more than one manager often waste the time they should be saving."
1993-07-18	G.E. to Stop Flow of PCB's Into the Hudson River	The General Electric Company agreed late this week to stem a new flow of PCB's into the Hudson River from its plant in Hudson Falls, about 35 miles north of Albany, and said it would investigate methods to clean the river of the toxic pollutant. The agreement, part of a consent order signed on Friday between the company and the State Department of Environmental Conservation, does not bind General Electric to clean the contaminated river.

Murphy, as president and chief executive of the division that makes jet engines for airliners and military aircraft. He succeeds Brian H. Rowe, who will remain chairman of the unit until his retirement at the end of next year. Mr. Murphy, who is 57, was chief executive of G.E.'s aerospace division until it was acquired by the Martin Marietta Corporation on April 2. Before that he headed the company's communications and services businesses.
1993-06-22	In a Czech Plant, VW Shows How to Succeed in the East	As Western companies spend less time searching Eastern Europe for new deals and more time scrambling to make existing investments pan out, Volkswagen A.G.'s acquisition of the Skoda automobile plant here suggests that with a clear strategy, attention to detail and some political support, the region can be profitable for the determined. With high-profile investments like the General Electric Company's acquisition of Tungsram, the Hungarian light-bulb maker, and Phibro Energy's involvement in the Russian oil industry floundering, Volkswagen after two years is already turning a modest operating profit building Skoda cars. Gains From Cheap Labor The German auto maker's plans to invest nearly $5 billion in Skoda by the end of the decade make the deal the largest firm corporate commitment in the former Soviet bloc. VW is capitalizing on low labor costs to build low-priced cars not just for the Czech Republic but for export to Germany, Britain, Greece, Turkey and other nations.

PLANNING TO ADD TO COST-CUTTING MOVES	The General Electric Company may cut another 1,000 jobs from its embattled aircraft engines division and abandon the largest building in its manufacturing complex in Evendale, Ohio, near Cincinnati, according to a report in The Cincinnati Enquirer. In its report, the newspaper said an internal G.E. cost-cutting study had recommended moving final engine assembly operations to other plants in Kansas and North Carolina. The moves could eliminate another 1,000 jobs in the Cincinnati area, on top of the 2,500 hourly and salaried positions the company cut in February.

1993-06-01	Operators of Nuclear Plants Are Warned of a Safety Risk	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has warned the operators of 34 nuclear reactors around the country that the instruments they use to measure the level of water in the reactors could give a false reading during routine shutdowns and fail to detect important leaks. The warning was issued Friday. The problem was first brought to light by an engineer at Northeast Utilities in Connecticut, who said later that he had been harassed for raising safety questions. Earlier this month, the commission agreed with him and said it would fine the utility; Northeast is appealing the ruling.
1993-05-14	GPA Bonds Rise on News Of G.E. Pact	The price of GPA Group bonds more than doubled early yesterday on the news of Wednesday's deal for the General Electric Company to help the troubled Irish aircraft leasing company avoid bankruptcy. But skepticism about whether creditors would accept the deal helped push the bonds off their highs. Prices for the company's most actively traded bonds, an 8 3/4 percent issue due in 1998, had hovered in the mid-$200 range Tuesday, but opened around $600 for each $1,000 yesterday morning, traders said. According to Bloomberg Financial Markets, the bonds then dropped to $565 for each $1,000 by late in the day.
1993-05-13	G.E.

1993-04-14	General Electric Co. (N)	The General Electric Company said yesterday that profits rose 9.6 percent in the first quarter, led by a strong performance at its financial unit, GE Capital Services. The unit's net income was up 22 percent in the quarter, compared with a year ago. John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, cited double-digit earnings gains in six of the company's 12 businesses -- NBC, appliances, locomotives, motors, power systems and plastics. But pretax profits were sharply lower in the aircraft engines unit. The drop was attributed to product-development costs and a charge for previously announced layoffs as orders dried up from airlines.
1993-04-13	G.E. Says NBC Isn't Up for Sale	"After nearly two years of speculation about a possible sale of NBC, John F. Welch, the chairman of the General Electric Company, told staff members of NBC News yesterday that the network was not for sale. The announcement was intended to stanch rumors of an impending sale that have dogged NBC, a division of G.E., and have contributed to a steep decline in morale among employees. Robert C. Wright, the president of NBC, said, ""This was General Electric saying: 'We're in this for the long haul.' """

Others say the best and tastiest shad swim up the river when the dogwood trees burst into color along the shoreline. Henry Gourdine, who has been a commercial fisherman for most of his 90 years, places little credence in either theory and waits instead for a southern breeze and moderating air temperatures.
1993-04-05	Martin Marietta's Defensive Strategy	For Norman R. Augustine, chairman of the Martin Marietta Corporation, signing up to buy the General Electric Corporation's aerospace division for $3 billion last year was far easier than the monumental task he now faces in consolidating the two businesses under one roof. That will mean laying off thousands of workers, closing production plants, and selling mediocre operations to achieve the economies of scale that Mr. Augustine promised last November when he agreed to the deal, which creates the world's largest military electronics company.

Tungsram had come to symbolize the marriage of a proud, century-old manufacturing tradition with invigorating Western technology and management expertise, and provided a model for joint ventures in the newly emerging market economies of post-Communist Eastern Europe.

About 2,500 jobs will be eliminated at G.E. Aircraft Engine's headquarters in Evendale, Ohio, an industrial area outside Cincinnati. About 700 jobs will be cut at the company's plant in Lynn, Mass., and 700 at smaller operations elsewhere. About 2,300 salaried workers and 1,600 hourly workers will be cut.
1993-02-14	Wall Street; And General Motors Marches On	IN the battle of the Generals last week, Electric was routed by Motors. As it happens, the same thing has been going on in the stock market since the end of last year. The battle in question was over the news report by General Electric's NBC television network regarding General Motors's old pickup trucks, which are said by some to be unsafe because the gasoline tank is outside the frame of the truck, making it more vulnerable to fire in side collisions. It turns out NBC used remote-controlled miniature rockets to make sure any gasoline that was released would burst into flames. To get out of a libel suit, the brass at G.E. decided to issue an abject apology.

1993-01-23	Delay in Martin Marietta's Purchase of G.E. Unit	The Martin Marietta Corporation said yesterday that completion of its pending acquisition of the General Electric Company's Aerospace division had been delayed a month, partly because of Government antitrust concerns. But the company said it was planning to complete the transaction by April 1. Company officials said the Justice Department, which must evaluate the transaction on antitrust grounds, had made a second request for information. They also said the $3.05 billion cost of the acquisition had forced a halt to the company's share buyback program and that it was uncertain when it would be resumed.

John F. Welch Jr, the company's chairman, said G.E.'s level of profitability ""is particularly rewarding in light of slow growth in the United States and around the world.""

Earnings rose to $1.11 billion, or $1.30 a share, from $1.04 billion, or $1.20 a share, in the third quarter of 1991.

It has been 15 years since the white-haired, pugnacious physician-turned-entrepreneur tested the first M.R.I. machine, a development that paved the way for doctors to get vivid color images of the interior of a person's body. Since then, M.R.I. has become a $2 billion industry, with most large cities having imaging centers where the million-dollar machines are used.

The action indefinitely bars the division, one of two primary suppliers of military jet engines, from renewing existing Government contracts and from being awarded new contracts. In imposing the suspension late Monday, the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency said it was considering whether to expand the sanctions to cover all of General Electric. The company, the Pentagon's third-largest supplier last year, with sales of $4.9 billion, provides the military everything from light bulbs to radar.
1992-05-09	Save the Hudson's Fishermen	"Before Aug. 6, 1975, Hudson River fishermen brought to market a bounty of shad, striped bass, sturgeon, perch, catfish, carp and eel. But on that date, their centuries' old tradition became imperiled: New York State announced that General Electric had discharged enough polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) into the river since 1946 to make most fish species too contaminated to sell. 

Shad and sturgeon are still allowed to be fished because they spend most of the year in the ocean, returning to the Hudson for just a few weeks each spring to spawn. But the heart of the fishery has been torn out. Few rivermen fish the relatively small population of sturgeon, and the shad season lasts just six weeks. Unless G. E., the state and the Environmental Protection Agency, all of which share responsibility for this tragedy, provide immediate assistance, one of New York's oldest industries will die."

Whistle Blower Could Face a Suit	The General Electric Company has threatened to sue a whistle-blowing employee to recover any monetary award he receives for bringing forward allegations of wrongdoing in the company's sale of military jet engines to Israel, people involved in the case said yesterday. For several years military contractors have sought ways to blunt the provisions of a Federal law intended to encourage and protect whistle blowers. But General Electric's threat to countersue the whistle blower in this case is a highly aggressive tactic that will raise substantial questions about the way the whistle-blower law works, lawyers and Congressional investigators said. Chilling Effect Seen Proponents of the law, the False Claims Act, said countersuits from companies would have a chilling effect on prospective whistle blowers and would undercut the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.

Most have also been through G.E.'s widely admired management training courses and have absorbed G.E.'s global perspective.

Out of these discussions, and through our experiences, we've agreed upon a set of values we believe we will need to take this company forward, rapidly, through the 1990's and beyond.
1992-03-04	A Softer 'Neutron Jack' at G.E.	"General Electric's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., who earned the nickname Neutron Jack on his reputation for eliminating people while leaving buildings standing, has gone through a conversion and is now preaching corporate pacifism. ""We cannot afford management styles that suppress and intimidate,"" he said in the company's new 1991 annual report. Instead, he called on his managers to adopt a set of ""soft concepts"" including such warm, fuzzy notions as having ""the self-confidence to empower others and behave in a boundaryless fashion."""
1992-02-18	G.E. Appoints Head Of Aerospace Business	Big corporate mergers often bring a wave of resignations and pink slips among top executives, but some executives of acquired companies survive and even thrive in the new order. Eugene F. Murphy, a lawyer and alumnus of the Central Intelligence Agency, is such a survivor. On Friday he was named the new head of the General Electric Company's aerospace business. Mr. Murphy, who is 55 years old, was head of RCA's communications and electronic services businesses in 1986 when G.E. acquired RCA, and was soon put in charge of G.E.'s communications and services businesses, with 13,000 employees and $2 billion of revenues.
1992-02-04	Pratt & Whitney's Comeback Bid	After losing much of the aircraft engine business to General Electric during the 1980's, Pratt & Whitney appears to be making a comeback. Lackadaisical customer service, with erratic parts supplies, are only bad memories. Now, a leaner company has a head start in the contest to supply a new generation of wide-body aircraft with the most powerful airline engines ever built.
1992-01-23	G.E. Cutting Jobs	A General Electric Company military systems plant here will eliminate 500 jobs this year because of cuts in spending by the Pentagon. The factory, which employed about 5,000 people in the mid-1980's, now has a work force of 2,900. A spokesman said the layoffs could begin late this quarter.
1992-01-22	G.E. Net Up by 2% In Quarter	Helped by continued strength in financial services, the General Electric Company said yesterday that profits in the last three months of 1991 edged up 2 percent, to more than $1.26 billion. It also cited growth in businesses where products are ordered many months or even years in advance, like medical equipment, power systems and aircraft engines. The double-digit profits in these businesses compensated for sharp declines at the company's NBC broadcasting subsidiary and in the economically sensitive materials group, which supplies products like plastics to a wide range of industries.
1992-01-03	Longtime Executives Are Promoted by G.E.	"Glen H. Hiner's recent decision to leave General Electric's plastics business to become chief executive at Owens-Corning Fiberglas has produced quick benefits for two longtime G.E. executives: Yesterday the company named Gary L. Rogers to take over as head of the $5 billion plastics business and J. Richard Stonesifer to take Mr. Rogers's place as head of the appliance business. By moving to plastics, the 47-year-old Mr. Rogers gets a chance to add to his credentials as one of a handful of General Electric Company executives in the running to succeed John F. Welch Jr., 56, as chief executive one day. Mr. Welch yesterday called him ""one of the great young leaders"" at the company."
1991-12-29	Taking Some Cues From G.E.	GENERAL MOTORS and the International Business Machines Corporation, which plans to cut 20,000 workers next year, get poor marks from Wall Street and business professors. The problem is footdragging on cost-cutting, despite some clear industrial examples available to follow. When John F. Welch Jr., then 45 years old, became chairman and chief executive of the ailing General Electric Company in 1981, action was immediate, and tough. And G.E. posted an unbroken record of rising quarterly profits until a big charge for accrued pension liabilities temporarily halted the streak early this year.
1991-12-29	All About: Silicone Products; A War Baby, Versatile Silicone Now Shows Up Everywhere	ALTHOUGH they only occasionally grab headlines, and then only when used in their most exotic applications, such as breast implants or the O-rings of the space shuttle, silicone compounds have become blue-collar mainstays of the chemical world. Silicone compounds are so widely used in construction, industrial applications, textile production and service sector support businesses like printing and labeling that the earnings growth of the Dow Corning Corporation (negative in 1982, slipping since 1987), the largest silicone producer, can be used as an indicator for the health of the economy. Few worldwide markets the size of silicone's -- some estimates run as high as $6 billion -- are made up of so many niches. Dow Corning estimates that it sells more than 5,000 silicone products to 105 different segments of industry, none accounting for more than 3 percent of the company's total sales of silicone products. The General Electric Company, the No. 2 producer, figures it has more than 4,000 silicone products.
1991-12-27	G.E. Names New Head For Distribution Unit	"W. James McNerney Jr., who was named yesterday as the new head of the General Electric Company's $1.7 billion Electrical Distribution and Control business, is quick to say he has a lot of homework to do. He comes to his new post with a background in consumer products, consulting, and a variety of assignments at G.E. that have little to do with the circuit breakers, automation controls, switches, transformers and other industrial equipment in which his new group specializes. Mr. McNerney, 42 years old, will replace Stephen Rabinowitz, 48, who was named vice president in charge of special projects. In a news release announcing the changes, John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, ambiguously described the unit as ""one of G.E.'s most competitive global businessess."" When asked whether he thought Mr. Welch meant that G.E. products had an unusually strong position or that the industry was a particularly tough one for G.E., Mr. McNerney was uncertain."
1991-12-19	G.E. to End Support Of Audubon Series	The General Electric Company has decided not to renew its $3 million in funding for the National Audubon Society's series of television specials when its commitment expires in 1993. Loggers and ranchers who disapproved of the documentaries' portrayal of environmental issues saw the decision as the result of their protests against G.E.'s support of the programs. But a G.E. spokeswoman said yesterday that because the company had reduced its communications budget, it could not justify making additional program grants.
1991-12-18	Electronic Data Gets G.E. Job	The General Electric Company awarded a contract to the Electronic Data Systems Corporation to manage purchases of personal computers, software and related products for G.E.'s global operations as well as the computer service business that G.E. provides to customers, the companies said today. Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services, a research firm in Palo Alto, Calif., said the five-year deal would be worth at least $30 million a year. Stephen Clancy, an analyst at Ledgeway/Dataquest, a research firm in Framingham, Mass., estimated revenues at close to $100 million a year.
1991-10-17	Rolls vs. G.E. in a Sales Dogfight	Charles J. Cuddington's blue eyes flash with anger as he talks about how the General Electric Company vanquished Rolls-Royce P.L.C. in the battle to supply engines for Boeing 777 wide-body jets ordered by British Airways, a longtime Rolls customer. G.E. won the engine contract in August, worth as much as $1.4 billion, by underbidding Rolls and then outbidding it to buy British Airways' engine-overhaul operation in Wales. Analysts say the price for the operation -- $:272 million, or $$460.7 million -- vastly exceeds its worth.
1991-10-16	G.E. Profits Rose by 2% In 3d Quarter	The General Electric Company reported a modest 2 percent increase in third-quarter profits yesterday but said earnings of its finance subsidiary jumped 19 percent as nonperforming assets declined. With earnings at its Kidder, Peabody brokerage improving and with its NBC division benefiting from the sale of an asset, the company said that most of its major businesses were resisting the economic downturn. However, it said that earnings at its appliances, aircraft engine, aerospace and materials divisions were weaker and acted as a drag on earnings.
1991-10-06	"NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Westboro, Mass.;
G.E. Building At a New Site"	"THE General Electric Company is about to move into a $10 million hilltop headquarters here that it built with the Trammell Crow Company, which owns the 7.5-acre site near the intersection of I-495 and Route 9. 

The three-story, 75,000-square-foot brick, glass and precast concrete building is scheduled for completion this month, with occupancy next month, said Richard A. Galvin, a Trammell Crow Company general partner. It will house divisions now in three sites in Massachusetts."
1991-09-17	G.E. Sets $1.8 Billion Charge For Rule on Retiree Benefits	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it would take a $1.8 billion non-cash, after-tax charge against its earnings for the first quarter of the year to comply with a new accounting rule concerning retirees' health benefits. The charge to earnings, which works out to be about $2.07 a share for the quarter that ended on March 31, will turn a gain of $1.15 a share into a loss of 85 to 95 cents after the company's earnings are restated. Still, G.E.'s shares rose $1.875 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $69.75.
1991-08-29	Navy Chooses G.E. Engine	The Navy chose the Growth II+ version of the General Electric Aircraft Engine Group's F404 jet engine for its proposed F-18E and F-18F carrier-based twin-engine fighters, the company said Tuesday. The G.E. division said the initial $5 million contract for engine development, along with a contract it expected later this year for engineering and manufacturing work, would not alter the size of the work force at its plant in Evendale, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb.
1991-08-28	NBC Denies Reports That It Is Being Sold	"NBC issued an official denial yesterday of reports that its parent company, the General Electric Company, was negotiating the sale of the network to the Los Angeles developer Marvin Davis, and it repeated assurances that the network was not for sale. But a Wall Street analyst said NBC was at least ""unofficially"" for sale and had been for about a year."
1991-08-25	Experimental Cleaning of Hudson Is Under Way	A multimillion dollar experiment to show that toxic PCB's can be removed from the bottom of the Hudson River by using river bacteria is under way here, about 190 miles north of New York City. Scientists from the General Electric Company began the experiment on Aug. 9, a few miles south of the company's two manufacturing plants that caused the problem by dumping PCB's in the river from 1946 to 1976, when they were banned. The bacteria breakdown of PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, is intended as an alternative to dredging.
1991-08-24	G.E. Layoffs Set	"The General Electric Company, the nation's third- largest military contractor, has announced it will cut at least 200 jobs at a local plant by the end of this year. The cutback announced Thursday means a 15 percent reduction in G.E.'s Volusia County work force of about 1,300. The first wave of layoff notices to an undetermined number of workers will come Sept. 4. ""Global defense budgets are shrinking and competition for a larger share of a smaller pie is intense,"" Pete Kujawski, G.E.-Daytona general manager, said in a statement."
1991-08-22	British Air Chooses Boeing And Orders G.E. Engines (Boeing)	British Airways chose the Boeing Company today as its supplier for aircraft worth $6.85 billion. The decision was a strong confirmation of Boeing's new mid-size jet, the 777, and was a victory for the American company over the competing European Airbus Industrie consortium. Airline industry analysts were not surprised, however, because British Airways has usually bought from Boeing. The surprising aspect of the decision was that British Airways, which has consistently flown its Boeing aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines, said it would power its 777's with a new engine from the General Electric Company.
1991-08-22	G.E. Sued on Nuclear Plant	"The owners of a four-year-old nuclear plant near Cleveland yesterday sued the General Electric Company, the builder, complaining that design errors had caused construction delays, adding ""hundreds ofmillions of dollars"" to the cost. The Perry plant cost $5.4 billion. The five utilities that own the plant said G.E. knew when the contract was negotiated that part of the containment system was faulty, and that the company committed misrepresentation and fraud."
1991-08-15	U.S. Accuses G.E. of Fraud In Israeli Deal	The Justice Department has accused the General Electric Company of defrauding the Pentagon of more than $30 million on the sale of jet engines and support services to the Israeli Air Force, according to a lawsuit made public yesterday. The civil fraud charges are the first against an American military contractor in the case, which has already led to a guilty plea in Israel by an Israeli Air Force general on fraud and bribery charges. The case has deeply embarrassed the Israeli military, which receives $1.8 billion from the United States annually to finance weapons purchases from American contractors, and has led to a Federal criminal investigation in the United States of General Electric and several of its current and former employees.
1991-08-14	Corrections	A brief article in the Company News columns of Business Day yesterday by Bloomberg Business News, about the Amoco Corporation, referred incorrectly to a recent transaction involving Amoco and a unit of the General Electric Company. The Amoco Olefins Corporation, a unit of Amoco, exercised an option to purchase an olefins production plant it has been leasing from GE Capital Transportation and Industrial Funding. Because the purchase price exceeded $15 million, the deal required Federal Trade Commission approval, which was granted on Thursday.
1991-08-06	Chase to Sell Most of Its Leasing Operation	The Chase Manhattan Corporation announced plans yesterday to sell most of its leasing businesses in the United States and Canada to four finance companies, including subsidiaries of the General Electric Company and the Ford Motor Company. The sales will reduce Chase Manhattan's asset size by about $2.2 billion and help strengthen the company's financial condition.
1991-07-26	Lost Work at G.E. Will Mean Layoffs	The loss of a $50.5 million Navy contract means more layoffs and additional cost-cutting measures for General Electric's Syracuse operations, a company spokeswoman said. G.E. lost the contract last week to the International Business Machines Corporation, the spokeswoman, Connie Grasso, said.
1991-07-18	Paris Bank Seeks Air France Stake	Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-owned French bank, plans to take a minority interest in Air France by injecting $166 million into the airline. Shareholders in the state-owned carrier now have about $1.81 billion in equity, but Banque de Paris will not know how much it will own until an evaluation of the airline's assets, an Air France spokeswoman said.
1991-07-17	G.E. Net Climbs by 3.7% Despite Weakness at NBC	The General Electric Company reported an earnings increase of 3.7 percent in the second quarter, bucking the recession and weakness at its NBC broadcasting network. Earnings rose to $1.13 billion, or $1.30 a share, from $1.09 billion, or $1.22 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales in the quarter increased 2.8 percent, to $14.8 billion from $14.4 billion.
1991-06-28	Allied Picks Chief and Wall St. Approves	It was a humbling finale to a see-saw relationship. Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said yesterday that he would step down on Monday as chief executive of Allied-Signal Inc., and Wall Street responded with embarrassing enthusiasm, delaying the opening of Allied's shares with a flood of buy orders. Mr. Hennessy, 63 years old, decided to leave earlier than expected to persuade Lawrence A. Bossidy, vice chairman of the General Electric Company, to succeed him. The transition plans were reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal and confirmed by Mr. Hennessy before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange. Allied shares ended the day at $33.125, up $3.75.
1991-06-27	G.E. Seeks to Sell to Agency Buildings Set Aside for Poor	The General Electric Company has negotiated what critics say will be a highly profitable deal with the Government by taking advantage of a housing program intended to help the poor. The company is now trying to reduce its initial costs even further. It is seeking $27.6 million in financing for a nonprofit agency it has selected as a business partner.
1991-06-27	Housing Earmarked for the Poor Is Enriching Big Investors Instead	A Federal program of housing for the poor is turning into profits for big real estate investors, led by one of America's business giants, the General Electric Company. General Electric is about to become the biggest buyer under a Federal program in which nearly 500 apartment complexes taken over from failed savings and loan institutions are being sold by the Resolution Trust Corporation at discount prices to investors who agree to set aside 35 percent of the units for low-income families.
1991-06-16	Making a Difference; Going After G.E.	Nancy Cole does not think the General Electric Company brings good things to life. Which is why, as director of Infact, a grassroots group based in Boston, she is trying to drive the company out of the nuclear weapons business. Nuclear weapons? G.E.? The company that lights America's homes and fills its airwaves with soft-focus ads? Five years ago, Infact chose G.E. as the target of a boycott because, in its view, the image the company has carefully nurtured is so at variance with its work making components for nuclear missile systems.
1991-06-13	G.E. Boycott Is Working, Group Says	A group that has been pressing a boycott against the General Electric Company for five years to try to force the company's withdrawal from nuclear weapons work said yesterday that it had made a significant dent in the company's sales of medical diagnostic equipment. But the company said that its share of that market was growing, along with its sales of consumer goods, and that the boycott did not appear to be having any effect.
1991-05-30	G.E. Sells Its 50% Stake In Video Unit	The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had sold its 50 percent stake in RCA Columbia Home Video, to the Sony Corporation, its partner in the joint venture. The news came as little surprise to the industry, in which a sale had been rumored for some time. RCA Columbia Home Video is one of the largest worldwide home video businesses, said Patrick Campbell, its president. In the United States, only Warner Home Video is larger, and RCA Columbia is the largest overseas.
1991-05-18	Barclays-G.E. Unit	Barclays Bank P.L.C. said that its Mercantile Credit Company Ltd. subsidiary had agreed to sell its vehicles-loans business to the GE Capital Corporation, a unit of the General Electric Company. Terms of the sale, which involves six Mercantile Credit branch offices in Britain and 130 staff members, were not disclosed. Barclays estimated the assets were worth $450 million.
1991-05-03	Underwriters Set G.E. Notes at 7.89%	The General Electric Company took advantage of favorable rate conditions yesterday, entering the debt market to sell $500 million in five-year notes through underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company. Underwriters gave the notes, which reach maturity on May 1, 1996, a 7 7/8 percent coupon. The issue was then priced for offering at 99.934 to yield 7.89 percent, or about 30 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. The company's debt is among the few that are still rated triple-A by both Moody's and S.& P.
1991-05-01	Layoffs at G.E.	The General Electric Company said its jet-engine division would lay off 1,800 people, including 1,000 who worked on its losing bid to supply engines to the Air Force's newest jet fighter. The layoffs had been expected since last week, when the Pentagon chose Pratt & Whitney Inc. to supply engines for the Advanced Tactical Fighter. The layoffs represent about 5 percent of the work force of 37,000 at G.E.'s plant in Evendale, Ohio.
1991-04-16	Net Rises 5.2% at G.E.; Financial Services Gain	Buoyed by productivity improvements and strong gains in its financial services sector, the General Electric Company said yesterday that its first-quarter net income rose 5.2 percent. Profits totaled $999 million, or $1.15 a share. In last year's first quarter, G.E. earned $950 million, or $1.06 a share. Its revenues were up 5.6 percent, to $13.3 billion, from $12.6 billion a year earlier.
1991-04-13	G.E. and Toshiba in Appliance Deal	The General Electric Company and the Toshiba Corporation agreed to work together to expand sales of G.E. appliances in Asia. The imported products, mainly large refrigerators and European-produced appliances, will be distributed by Toshiba in Japan, and Toshiba will provide after-sales services. Gary Rogers, a senior vice president at G.E., said that through a venture to be established in Tokyo next month, the company hoped to increase its sales of appliances in Japan to $50 million a year by 1995, from about $5 million a year now.
1991-04-13	Patents; Four at G.E. Honored on Blood-Vessel Images	Four researchers at the General Electric Company this week shared the award for Inventor of the Year, presented by the Intellectual Property Owners Foundation in Washington. The researchers were honored for inventing a non-invasive method of obtaining vivid images of blood vessels and blood flow that employs magnetic resonance imaging.
1991-04-05	Award in G.E. Age Case	"A Wayne County jury awarded $1 million to a former salesman for the General Electric Company who sued the company and a G.E. joint venture on age discrimination charges, his lawyers said today. Richard N. Pietsch, 58 years old, also accused the companies of breach of employment contract and of failing to abide by promises made to him when G.E. hired him in 1981. The award could benefit other employees whose jobs have been lost or are threatened under ""reorganization,"" ""reduction in force"" or other actions cited by their employers, the statement said."
1991-03-28	Israeli General Is Sentenced To 13 Years in Bribery Case	A former chief purchasing officer in the Israeli Air Force was sentenced today to 13 years in prison for receiving $10 million in bribes and kickbacks on purchases of American-made equipment. Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan's rank was reduced to private and he will be dishonorably discharged, the military court said.
1991-03-21	Threat of Fire Brings Coffee Maker Recall	The General Electric Company said yesterday that because of fuses that may pose a fire hazard, it was recalling electric drip coffee makers that were manufactured under the G.E. and Universal brands from 1976 to 1984. The company said the recall, involving all its coffee makers from that period except for Spacemaker models, stemmed from about 400 complaints concerning overheating, including reports of fires in which three people died. About 375 of the complaints involved property damage, which ranged from $300 to $1.3 million.
1991-03-19	Israeli General Pleads Guilty in Bribery Case	Only days after the Israeli Air Force began readjusting from a high state of alert during the Persian Gulf war, its officers are riveted by a new problem: a guilty plea by one of its most senior officers in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scandal involving United States military contractors. A military court in Tel Aviv is now deciding whether to accept the plea-bargain arrangement worked out for Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan, who was one of the Air Force's most senior purchasing officers. General Dotan also pleaded guilty to charges that he tried to arrange to kill the man who first exposed the scandal. He did not succeed at that. In December, he was charged with taking bribes and kickbacks totaling more than $10 million from unnamed American contractors from whom Israel bought aircraft parts and other materials. General Dotan headed the Defense Ministry's department of military acquisitions in New York in 1984 and 1985.
1991-03-08	Four Arrested In Japan Case	A former professor was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of accepting bribes from a medical supplier to buy General Electric medical equipment. Kengo Matsui, 59 years old, a former professor in the medical department of Yokohama Municipal University, was arrested along with three officials of the Yokogawa Medical Systems Company, prosecutors said. Yokogawa is a joint venture that is 75 percent owned by the General Electric Company.
1991-03-02	G.E. Layoffs Set	The General Electric Company is laying off 40 people in Syracuse, effective immediately, in expectation of losing a $545 million radar contract with the Air Force, a company spokeswoman said. G.E. has already built two over-the-horizon radar systems, which bounce radio waves off the earth's ionosphere to detect objects up to 1,800 miles away. The company employs about 5,400 people in the Syracuse area.
1991-02-27	Surprise Pact By G.E. Unit To Buy FNN	CNBC, General Electric's cable news service, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the troubled Financial News Network for $105 million in cash. The surprise bid, which CNBC made privately on Friday and was approved by the two companies late Monday, is reported to be $15 million higher than a joint offer made two weeks ago by Dow Jones & Company and Westinghouse Broadcasting.
1991-02-21	Workers at G.E. Subsidiary Accused by Japan of Bribery	In a rare criminal action against an American company operating in Japan, prosecutors in Tokyo have arrested two Japanese employees of a General Electric Company subsidiary here and a prominent university professor, charging them with bribery in connection with the sale of sophisticated medical equipment. The charges were filed last week in what now appears to be a widening investigation. It is charged that the employees made payments to professors who decide whether their hospitals will purchase American- or Japanese-made medical equipment. General Electric sells a half-billion dollars in CAT scanners, magnetic resonance imaging devices and other equipment through a company called Yokogawa Medical Systems, of which it owns 75 percent.
1991-01-27	Ideas & Trends; A Company Looks For A Cheap, Natural Way To Clean Up Pollution	SOMETIME this June, researchers from the General Electric Company plan to pound half a dozen six-foot-wide pipes into the bed of the upper Hudson River as part of an attempt to save the company as much as $280 million in environmental cleanup costs. When the results are in many months later, the company hopes to have the first evidence from the field that scientists can help nature reduce the toxicity of PCB's in sediment on the river bottom. General Electric believes that bacteria are already causing PCB's to degrade naturally in the Hudson. Company scientists hope to show that they can accelerate the process by pouring more bacteria and nutrients into some of the pipes. If they are successful, the company may be able to avoid dredging 40 miles of PCB-contaminated Hudson River sediment. To see if the method, known as bioremediation, is realistic, General Electric said it is planning to invest $50 million.
1991-01-24	Credit Units Sold By Carter Hawley	Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., the largest retail company on the West Coast, said it had agreed to sell its credit card and accounts-receivable operations to the GE Capital Corporation. Carter Hawley Hale said the transaction would result in a net gain of $50 million and the elimination of $600 million in debt. The two companies said they expected the deal to close by late April. Carter Hawley Hale has been struggling with heavy debt and slow sales. In September, it sold its Thalhimer Brothers department store chain to the May Department Stores Company for $325 million in a plan to consolidate operations and reduce debt.
1991-01-23	General Electric Reports 6% Rise in Profits and Revenues	The General Electric Company said yesterday that its net income and revenues both rose by 6 percent in the last three months of 1990. Earnings increased to almost $1.24 billion, from $1.17 billion in the last quarter of 1989. And its revenues rose to $17.2 billion from $16.2 billion.
1991-01-22	G.E. Sets Thorn Deal; Lamp Chief Is Chosen	The General Electric Company completed its deal yesterday to buy Thorn EMI P.L.C.'s $360 million European light bulb business and named David E. Momot to be president and chief executive of the newly created company, G.E.-Thorn Lamps Ltd. Mr. Momot comes from a stint at the Genlyte Group, a maker of lighting fixtures, where he was president and chief executive, and which he joined in 1989. He is no stranger to G.E., having worked there for 30 years until 1989.
1991-01-22	G.E. Halts Commercials That Feature Hungary	"While many companies are deciding whether it is wise to advertise during the Persian Gulf war, General Electric has decided it is definitely improper to run ads highlighting changes in Eastern Europe while a crackdown is taking place in the Baltic republics. The company has dropped a television spot featuring its joint venture with Tungsram, the Hungarian lighting company. The ad, which ran on network television for more than nine months, showed the streets of Budapest, as well as the faces of Hungarians, lighting up as the country moved toward democracy. The ads had a sort of homespun warmth, using light as a visual analogy for freedom. They generally ran during news programs, and were shown last week midway through news coverage of the takeover of Lithuanian broadcast and television studios by Soviet troops, during which several people were killed. ""In response to world events, G.E. for the present time has discontinued the ads,"" said Jack Batty, a company spokesman. No one at the company would say when the ads might be reintroduced."
1991-01-19	Documents Case Plea	A consultant was sentenced on Wednesday to six months of house detention after pleading guilty to interstate transportation of technical documents stolen from the General Electric Company. United States District Judge David S. Nelson also fined Chien-Min Sung $200,000 and ordered him to make restitution of $120,000 to G.E. Mr. Sung, 43 years old, admitted he had failed to return about 80 documents containing technical information owned by G.E. when he left the company in 1987 to take a job with the Norton Company in Worcester, Mass. He is now a private consultant.
1991-01-16	News from the Mideast via the P.C.	The nation's technology-minded citizens -- from antiwar groups to arms makers to veterans and relatives of members of the military -- are turning in large numbers to their personal computers for news bulletins from the Persian Gulf. The major computer-information services, including Prodigy, Compuserve, General Electric Information Services and America On-line, are offering rapidly compiled data bases with specialized information on the Middle East crisis. They have also set up special electronic areas in which people can communicate with each other -- through modems that allow them to receive information on their computer screens via telephone lines.
1991-01-06	Tungsram's Track Record in Research	"To the Editor: Regarding ""Running on Fast-Forward in Budapest,"" Dec. 16, which described the joint venture between General Electric and Tungsram, a Hungarian firm specializing in electric lighting, it may be of interest that, between the two World Wars, Tungsram created, in addition to its manufacturing facilities, one of the strongest research laboratories in Europe. The discoveries made and developed in this lab were patented by Tungsram and are the basis of its leading position in the industrial world. One of these discoveries by the distinguished physicist Imre Brody was the krypton incandescent lamp.

1986-12-15	BOEING FLIES INTO BRITISH POLITICAL FLAK	Within days, the British Government is expected to make a military procurement decision that will have a great impact not only on a multibillion-dollar segment of the global aerospace business, but also on domestic politics. The Government must choose between two suppliers for airborne-early-warning aircraft - planes stuffed with radar and computer gear to detect enemy movements and to act as mobile command posts. The rivals are the Boeing Company's Airborne Warning and Control Systems, known as AWACS, and the British General Electric Company's Nimrod. Cost and performance will be important considerations, to be sure. But far more than with most military-purchase decisions, the politics of the choice must be weighed carefully by the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

But as the company's centennial year, 1986 is a flop. General Electric, still the city's largest employer, has been cutting thousands of jobs here.

The suit was filed by Jerrold Shaffer, an RCA shareholder who was said to have sold his shares Wednesday. RCA's stock soared more than $10 by the end of trading on Wednesday, to $63.50, before the companies made any public disclosure that they were engaged in merger talks. Late Wednesday, after the stock market closed, the companies announced that G.E. had agreed to purchase RCA for $66.50 a share. This meant that, in the frantic trading before this news, anyone who sold the stock because he did not know a merger was imminent missed the increased price.

The report, made to an American Chemical Society meeting in Miami, is the first to indicate that large amounts of the chemical are biodegradable and, therefore, may be possibly less dangerous to human health than state and Federal regulations describe. However, officials of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, who are charged with cleaning up the PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, in the Hudson, were cautious in their assessment of the report.

Another company in which G.E. holds a partnership interest, CFM International of Cincinnati, was also awarded a $422.9 million contract on Thursday because the Air Force said the suspension of G.E.

In another matter involving Government scrutiny of the weapons industry, an Air Force spokesman confirmed today that it intends to notify the General Electric Company that its suspension Thursday from bidding on new Pentagon contracts will extend throughout the executive branch of the Government, including the General Services Administration, which manages Government procurement activities. For the auditing project, which is expected to take about 45 days, 14 auditors from the Pentagon's Defense Contract Audit Agency and the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, have been assigned to the committee. Their focus will be overhead costs billed to the Government, a subject of intense interest on Capitol Hill since evidence arose last year of improper billings for entertainment and personal travel by General Dynamics executives.
