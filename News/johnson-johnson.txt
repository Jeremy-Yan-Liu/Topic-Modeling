MARK SCOTTCHEAP GREEK DEBT Despite their previous losses from investing in Greek debt, a number of hedge funds are said to be considering another round of bets. This time, the funds are looking at the cheapest Greek bonds on the street: long-term, local-law bonds that currently trade at 19 cents on the euro -- a knock-down price that reflects Greece's ailing condition. By buying these bonds and then swapping them for new longer-term Greek securities when a debt restructuring takes place next month, the funds hope to make a quick profit. Traders and analysts expect the new bonds to have a market value of 26 to 30 cents. LANDON THOMAS Jr.

2010-09-18	BUSINESS BRIEFING | COMPANY NEWS: Johnson & Johnson in Talks to Buy Dutch Firm	Johnson & Johnson, the American health products company, said Friday that it was in advanced talks to bid for the 82 percent of Crucell, a Dutch biopharmaceutical firm, that it does not already own, in what would be a 1.75 billion euro ($2.3 billion) deal. The all-cash bid would give Crucell stakeholders 24.75 euros a share. Johnson & Johnson would acquire a company known for its research, manufacture and marketing of vaccines and antibodies. It bought its initial stake in Crucell for 300 million euros last year. Crucell shares rose 8.51 euros, or 54.19 percent, to 24.20 euros in Amsterdam on Friday, giving the company a market cap of nearly 2 billion euros. Fabian Smeets, an analyst at Rabo Securities, said he thought the bid might go higher. ''Johnson & Johnson could add a couple euros,'' Mr. Smeets said, citing Crucell's 500 million euros in cash. While other bidders may be in the wings, Crucell is bound by change-of-control clauses for certain products it makes and markets, including Quinvaxem, a vaccine against childhood diseases that it co-developed with Novartis and which is now a major revenue source for the Dutch company. Crucell could lose rights to the drug if it were sold to certain pharmaceutical competitors. Should the deal go through, Johnson & Johnson would maintain Crucell's management, staff levels and headquarters in Leiden, the Netherlands, the company said. The expectation of such a limited restructuring in the event of a takeover is one reason why Crucell prefers Johnson & Johnson, Mr. Smeets said, adding that it would occupy a special place in a company that allows for entrepreneurship, unlike some other drug makers. The last time Crucell was in play was just last year, but the bid from Wyeth fell through after it was taken over by Pfizer. --Chris V.

2006-02-12	Madison Avenue's 30-Second Spot Remover	FOR sci-fi movie fans, the opening titles of ''Alien,'' Ridley Scott's 1979 voyage through interstellar dread, perfectly evoke the film's ensuing themes. As a series of white rectangles gradually align to form the movie's title, the camera pans across the expanse of an enormous planet floating in the numbing, ominous, infinite void of outer space. For visual effects aficionados, Coca-Cola's 1992 television commercial featuring Paula Abdul hoofing it with digitally inserted film clips of Groucho Marx and Gene Kelly presaged time-traveling lures of later award-winning works like the movie ''Forrest Gump,'' in which Tom Hanks was digitally transported into the Kennedy White House.
2006-01-26	Quiet End To Battle Of the Bids	For Johnson & Johnson, Tuesday started with a morning conference call with analysts to discuss earnings and ended with William C. Weldon, the company's chief executive, and Robert J. Darretta Jr., the chief financial officer, attending a dinner for several dozen institutional investors at the ''21'' Club in New York. Throughout the day and evening, the company maintained a rigid silence about the one subject on everyone's mind -- whether it would respond to a midnight deadline to counter Boston Scientific's bold $27 billion offer for Guidant. ''They wanted to talk about anything but Guidant,'' said one investor who attended the dinner. ''It was the elephant in the room.''
2006-01-25	J.&J. Passes On Raising Guidant Bid	Johnson & Johnson let lapse a crucial midnight deadline without raising its bid for Guidant, paving the way for Boston Scientific to emerge as the winner in the takeover battle, people involved in the negotiations said last night. Barring a last-minute move by Johnson & Johnson, Guidant is expected to announce this morning that it will accept Boston Scientific's $27 billion offer, abandoning its deal with Johnson & Johnson, these people said.
2006-01-18	Boston Scientific, With Abbott's Help, Raises Bid for Guidant	The seven-week bidding war for Guidant, the medical device maker, took yet another unexpected twist yesterday as Boston Scientific, with financial help from Abbott Laboratories, made a bold $27 billion bid. The offer, at $80 a share, proved irresistible: within hours, Guidant said it would switch its support from Johnson & Johnson's merger proposal in favor of Boston Scientific's, which was valued more than $2 billion higher.
2006-01-14	The Bidding Keeps Going and Going and Going	IT was like a TV Land rerun marathon this week, with Boston Scientific topping Johnson & Johnson's bid for Guidant, the Dow eclipsing 11,000, General Motors scrambling to regain market share and Apple Computer being hailed as a blisteringly hot tech stock. There was even another sex-discrimination suit on Wall Street. Some things were new, however. China surpassed some Western industrial powerhouses with the size of its economy, and its global trade surplus set a record. FIGHT TO THE START -- It is a strange kind of bidding war when a last-minute offer from the underdog is about the same as the opening bid made by the heavily favored industry giant. But that is the case in the battle for Guidant, a maker of implantable heart devices.
2006-01-14	Johnson & Johnson Pulls Ahead in Takeover Battle for Guidant	Reacting decisively, Johnson & Johnson struck back last night in the biggest takeover battle ever in the medical device industry, raising its bid for the Guidant Corporation to $71 a share in cash and stock, or about $24.2 billion. In doing so, Johnson & Johnson was able to dissuade Guidant from backing out of a previously announced merger and going with a higher bid from Boston Scientific.
2006-01-13	Bid Raised In Battle For Guidant	Raising the stakes in an increasingly hostile takeover battle for Guidant, Boston Scientific increased its bid by $332 million last night, to $25 billion. It also said it would assume all regulatory risk to completing the deal in an effort to wrestle Guidant away from Johnson & Johnson. Boston's Scientific's offer also came with an ultimatum: If Guidant does not declare the bid superior to Johnson & Johnson's $23.2 billion by 4 p.m. today, it will be withdrawn.
2006-01-13	With the Spotlight on a Rival, St. Jude Medical Shines	No one can say yet whether Boston Scientific or Johnson & Johnson will win the fight to buy Guidant. But St. Jude Medical, Guidant's fast-growing rival in the booming business for heart-regulating implants, might be sorry to see the battle end. St. Jude had a memorable 2005, thanks in part to the spotlight's glare on Guidant.
2006-01-12	Johnson Raises Bid To Acquire Guidant	The battle for control of the Guidant Corporation, a maker of implantable heart devices, took a new turn last night as Johnson & Johnson raised its bid to $23.2 billion and reached a new agreement with Guidant, pre-empting an offer from Boston Scientific. But the outcome was quickly thrown into question when Boston Scientific dismissed Guidant's agreement with Johnson & Johnson, saying: ''Our discussions with Guidant are ongoing. We intend to vigorously pursue this transaction to its completion.''
2006-01-11	Johnson & Johnson Adds a Late Twist To Guidant Bidding	Guidant's board was wrestling last night with whether to select Boston Scientific's $25 billion bid amid an 11th-hour effort by a rival, Johnson & Johnson, to negotiate a new deal, people involved in the talks said yesterday. Guidant's board met yesterday and planned to declare Boston Scientific's offer superior to Johnson & Johnson's $21.4 billion bid, these people said. That would have set in motion a five-day deadline for Johnson & Johnson to make a new offer. Hoping to pre-empt such a showdown, Johnson & Johnson made a last-minute approach, these people said. But it was unclear last night if Johnson & Johnson had actually made a higher formal bid.
2006-01-11	Drugs in '05: Much Promise, Little Payoff; Just 20 New Products Are Approved, Despite Biotechnology's Hope	Even as pharmaceutical companies poured a record amount of money into drug development in 2005, the industry's research drought grew worse. According to newly released statistics from the Food and Drug Administration, it approved only 20 new drugs, down from 36 in 2004. Only once in last 10 years has the number of newly approved drugs been lower than last year's figure.
2006-01-04	U.S. Not Told Of 2 Deaths During Study Of Heart Drug	The Scios unit of Johnson & Johnson yesterday added to the questions already clouding its heart failure medication Natrecor, saying the company had failed to tell federal regulators about the deaths of two patients in a clinical trial of the drug. The two deaths were also omitted from a report of the trial published in October in The Journal of Emergency Medicine, the company said. That article reported 6 deaths within 30 days among 237 patients given Natrecor or other treatment in hospital emergency rooms in 2001 and early 2002. Five of those deaths were of people who had taken Natrecor.
2005-12-29	Guidant Board Sets Date For Vote on J.&J. Merger	Guidant said yesterday that its board of directors had reaffirmed its unanimous support for merging with Johnson & Johnson and set Jan. 31 as the date that Guidant shareholders would vote on the $21.5 billion cash and stock deal. Neither action bars Guidant from switching support in the coming weeks for a potential competing bid from Boston Scientific valued at roughly $25 billion. Boston Scientific hopes to complete its review of Guidant's operations in early January, which would clear the way for formally presenting its offer, according to Paul Donovan, a Boston Scientific spokesman.
2005-12-16	Shining Light On Corporate Political Gifts	WHICH politicians -- and which political causes -- are your companies financing? Will those contributions come back to haunt them as prosecutors go after lobbyists for expenditures that could be deemed contributions -- or bribes? These are questions that most shareholders are not in a position to answer. Few major companies now disclose what soft-dollar contributions they have made, or what contributions to politicians they have made in states where corporate contributions are legal.
2005-12-09	Street Scene; THE CHURN	Deal Makers Advising Boston Scientific on its rival $25 billion bid for Guidant are Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Banc of America Securities and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling. Guidant, which agreed to a bid from Johnson & Johnson, is being advised by Morgan Stanley, J. P. Morgan Chase and the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Goldman Sachs and the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore are advising Johnson & Johnson. People Robert C. Smith has joined Greenhill & Company as a managing director in New York. Mr. Smith had been co-head of financial industry mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup.
2005-12-09	Nerve Stimulation and Revenue Growth	An unexpected takeover battle between Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson for control of Guidant seems bound to send aftershocks through the medical device industry. There is widespread speculation about the effects on prominent competitors like Medtronic and St. Jude Medical in Guidant's main business of electrical implants that regulate heart functioning. Investors and analysts also wonder who will end up with Guidant's business of making stents and other devices used to treat circulatory illnesses.
2005-12-07	Rivals Gird For Battle On Guidant	Battle lines have been drawn in the fight for control of Guidant, the medical device maker whose crown jewel is its strong position in the huge and fast-growing market for heart-regulating implants. Johnson & Johnson, responding yesterday to Boston Scientific's unexpected $25 billion bid for Guidant on Monday, asserted that the $21.5 billion merger agreement it reached with Guidant on Nov. 15 represented ''full and fair value.''
2005-12-06	New Suitor Makes Higher Bid for Troubled Heart Device Maker	Boston Scientific made a surprise bid yesterday to acquire the Guidant Corporation for about $25 billion in a bold move to snatch Guidant from Johnson & Johnson, which last month agreed to buy the device maker for $21.5 billion. The offer could spark a battle for control of Guidant, the nation's second-largest maker of implantable defibrillators and pacemakers after Medtronic. Last month, Johnson & Johnson sharply lowered its original $76-a-share offer for Guidant to $63.08 a share, after declaring that recent recalls and investigations involving its heart devices had damaged the company's prospects.
2005-12-06	A Guidant Bid That Wins Even if It Appears to Lose	Boston Scientific's attempt to crash Johnson & Johnson's merger party with Guidant caught Wall Street by surprise yesterday, but perhaps it should not have. As they analyzed Boston Scientific's takeover bid, many analysts saw logic as well as genius in the $25 billion offer. Adding Guidant would make Boston Scientific a leader in pacemakers and defibrillators, the one major heart device market where it has not competed. The worldwide market for defibrillators -- about $8 billion a year -- is the newest area for cardiac rhythm management devices, and according to Lazard Capital Markets, the segment should grow more than 20 percent annually over the next two years.
2005-12-03	Medicare Balks at Covering Johnson Heart Drug in Some Cases	The bad news continued yesterday for Johnson & Johnson's heart-failure drug Natrecor, with the Medicare program announcing that it wants to stop paying for the product's use in some patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said yesterday that it had not found enough evidence that the drug, which costs about $500 a treatment, was necessary or reasonable for patients with chronic heart failure.
2005-11-16	Price Tag Of Guidant Is Lowered	Johnson & Johnson will pay $4 billion less than it had originally agreed to acquire Guidant, the troubled maker of implantable heart devices, under a revised $21.5 billion deal announced yesterday. The new agreement is an apparent acknowledgment by Guidant of how significantly its outlook has declined because of disclosures about product problems, device recalls, investigations and lawsuits.
2005-11-12	Adjustments, Shifts, Corrections and a Revision	THIS was a week for major course corrections, in mergers, in markets, in media and in the financial statements of the granddaddy of industrial companies, General Motors. DEAL BREAKER -- The Guidant Corporation, the nation's second-largest maker of implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, sued its erstwhile suitor, Johnson & Johnson, to make it follow through on its offer to buy Guidant for $25.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson got cold feet after learning that some Guidant products tended to short-circuit and might have contributed to patient deaths.
2005-11-11	In Study, Hormone Reduced Appetite in Mice	Hungry or full, fat or thin: it is mostly a matter of hormones, dozens of them, carrying messages between the digestive tract, the fat cells and the brain. Eat. Don't eat. Burn calories. Store fat. Today, researchers at Stanford University are reporting that they have found a previously unknown member of this chemical cascade, a hormone with a much coveted power: it sharply reduces the desire to eat.
2005-11-09	Guidant Panel to Assess Product Pipeline	The Guidant Corporation, whose $25.4 billion acquisition by Johnson & Johnson is in jeopardy, said yesterday that it was setting up an outside group to assess the company's process for developing new products. The team is in addition to a separate independent panel the company appointed earlier to evaluate monitoring and communication on devices already sold, Guidant said. The company recalled 109,000 faulty defibrillators in June.
2005-11-08	Guidant Sues Johnson & Johnson for Completion of Merger	The Guidant Corporation filed a federal lawsuit yesterday to force Johnson & Johnson to complete its $25.4 billion acquisition of the company. Johnson & Johnson contends that the deal for Guidant is now void because of Guidant's financial and legal problems. Separately, Guidant, which is the nation's second-largest maker of implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, said that third-quarter profit fell 57 percent because of a series of recent recalls of its devices. It warned that fourth-quarter results were likely to be lower than last year's.
2005-11-04	Prospects for Revising the Guidant-Johnson Deal Dim	The prospects that Johnson & Johnson will reach a new agreement to buy Guidant appeared to diminish yesterday, with people involved in the talks expressing for the first time skepticism that the companies will be able to resuscitate the transaction. The companies remained at an impasse over the price of a renegotiated deal, the people involved said, with each side expressing increased frustration with the other. The initial deal was worth $25.4 billion, or $76 a share.
2005-11-03	TROUBLED MAKER OF HEART DEVICES MAY LOSE SUITOR	Johnson & Johnson yesterday threatened to abandon its plan to acquire the Guidant Corporation, a troubled heart device maker, setting the stage for a financial and legal confrontation between the companies over the $25.4 billion deal. The development is a stunning reversal for a deal that was applauded when it was announced in December as both a handsome payoff for Guidant shareholders and a way for Johnson & Johnson to enter the fast-growing market for implanted heart devices.
2005-11-03	Buyer's Remorse Is Causing Some Palpitations at Johnson	Johnson & Johnson's stumble in the purchase of the Guidant Corporation, the medical device maker, illustrates the perils of designing a corporate strategy around acquisitions. Until recently, Johnson & Johnson served as the rare example of a company that could execute such a strategy successfully. From 1995 to the end of last year, Johnson & Johnson bought 51 companies.
2005-11-01	U.S. Approval Is Expected Soon for Sale Of Guidant	Johnson & Johnson's proposed acquisition of the Guidant Corporation is expected to be approved by the Federal Trade Commission as early as today, executives involved in the deal said yesterday. Approval of the transaction may force the companies to end a standoff over renegotiating the price of the $25.4 billion deal.
2005-10-27	Guidant Shares Go Lower After Subpoenas on Devices	Shares of the Guidant Corporation, a heart device maker, slid yesterday as investors took the news that the company had received two Justice Department subpoenas as a further sign that Johnson & Johnson would reduce or abandon its $25.4 billion offer to buy Guidant. Late Monday, Guidant and two other makers of pacemakers and defibrillators, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, disclosed that they had received subpoenas from the United States attorney in Boston as part of a federal investigation into whether the companies used illegal inducements to get doctors to use their products.
2005-10-19	Rethinking The Cost Of a Deal	Johnson & Johnson, the medical products giant, has indicated to the Guidant Corporation that it wants to renegotiate a lower price than the $25.4 billion it agreed to pay in December, two people involved in the talks said. Guidant, a maker of medical devices, has insisted that the deal be completed as agreed, said the two people. Any disputes between the companies, if not resolved, could erupt into a court battle.
2005-10-18	In Test, Endeavor Stent Fails to Match a Rival	As Wall Street had expected, results of a clinical trial reported yesterday showed that the Endeavor stent from Medtronic was inferior to the Cypher device from Johnson & Johnson at preventing the growth of scar tissue within the stent. Stents are used to prop open heart arteries after blockages have been cleared. Endeavor and Cypher are part of a new generation of stents that are coated with drugs to reduce the tendency of scar tissue to grow so aggressively that blood flow is seriously impaired.
2005-10-14	Dutch Court Blocks Sale of Stents	Boston Scientific said yesterday that a ruling by a Dutch appeals court would block the production, use and sale in the Netherlands of drug-coated stents made by Johnson & Johnson's Cordis subsidiary. Cordis and Boston Scientific are the leading makers of drug-coated stents, which have become a $6 billion worldwide market. Stents are metal mesh cylinders implanted in coronary arteries to keep them open after blockages have been cleared. The drug coating is meant to deter scarring that can cause new blockages.
2005-10-13	Johnson Sues Amgen Over Sales Practice	In the latest skirmish in a bitter war over the best-selling drug ever created by biotechnology, Johnson & Johnson has filed an antitrust suit accusing rival Amgen of using illegal leverage to drive its drug, Procrit, out of the market. In a suit filed Tuesday in Federal District Court in Trenton, N.J., Johnson & Johnson said Amgen was bundling sales of its drugs in a way that forces cancer clinics to buy Amgen's Aranesp at the expense of Procrit.
2005-09-29	Guidant Case May Involve Crime Inquiry	Criminal investigators at the Food and Drug Administration have apparently become involved in the agency's inquiry into how the Guidant Corporation handled problems with its heart devices, said two people contacted by the investigators. Since June, the F.D.A. has been looking into several issues involving Guidant, including whether it properly reported failures of some of its heart devices and manufacturing changes to correct the problems. The agency's Office of Criminal Investigations is often called upon to examine such issues.
2005-09-29	'Will & Grace' Goes Live, And So Does a Commercial	A commercial offering a humorous salute to the pitfalls of live television is scheduled to raise the curtain tonight on the first live episode of the sitcom ''Will & Grace'' on NBC. The commercial is for the Neutrogena line of skin care and cosmetics products sold by Johnson & Johnson, which is a regular advertiser on ''Will & Grace.'' The spot, by Roberts & Tarlow in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, presents bloopers committed by celebrities as they filmed Neutrogena commercials. ''Now you know why we don't do live commercials,'' an announcer says.
2005-08-26	European Commission Approves Deal for Guidant Takeover	The European Commission cleared Johnson & Johnson's planned $25.4 billion takeover of the medical equipment maker Guidant after the companies agreed to sell some of their businesses, the commission said Thursday. The approval eliminated one of the main regulatory obstacles facing the proposed deal, but the combination still faces an antitrust inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, expected to be concluded in October, the companies said.
2005-08-23	Guidance to Doctors On a Coronary Drug	Johnson & Johnson's Scios unit said yesterday that it had begun a campaign to educate doctors on the appropriate use of its drug Natrecor, an intravenous treatment for heart failure. The Food and Drug Administration approved Natrecor in 2001 for use in acutely ill heart-failure patients, people who arrived at the hospital gasping for air.
2005-08-18	Johnson to Increase Output of Cypher Stent	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would increase production of its Cypher heart stent, which outperformed a competing device from the Boston Scientific Corporation in three studies released on Tuesday. The company is also working to expand capacity at its Puerto Rican factory where most of the devices are made, said Brian Firth, vice president for medical affairs at the Cordis unit. Mr. Firth said Johnson & Johnson could meet only about half the demand for drug-coated stents, which doctors use to prop open cleared heart arteries.
2005-08-09	Hanging on a Hit; Company's Stent Is a Superstar, but What About an Encore?	Few companies have ever enjoyed a product success like Boston Scientific did when it introduced its Taxus stent to the American market 16 months ago. Taxus blew by records for a new health care product -- even such high-profile drugs as Viagra -- topping $2 billion in domestic sales in its first year. And the stent, a tiny drug-coated metal sleeve inserted into arteries near the heart to keep them open after doctors remove blockages, is unusually lucrative for a medical device, generating profit margins of more than 90 percent.
2005-08-09	Expert Panel Gives Advice That Surprises A Drug Maker	Call it the advisory committee that keeps on giving advice. After two medical studies questioned the safety of its popular heart failure therapy Natrecor, the Scios unit of Johnson & Johnson turned in April to a technique government and business often use to make problems go away: it formed an outside advisory committee.
2005-08-01	Europeans Say Medtronic Can Sell Stent	Medtronic said yesterday that it had received its long-awaited clearance from European regulators to market its drug-coated Endeavor heart stent. The approval opens the door for Medtronic to compete with Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson in one of the medical device industry's largest and most lucrative markets. It also clears the way for Medtronic to begin marketing Endeavor in many other countries that follow Europe's regulatory lead on medical devices, including Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, Mexico and several Persian Gulf nations.
2005-07-21	U.S. Looking at Marketing By Johnson & Johnson	Johnson & Johnson's aggressive marketing of its heart-failure treatment Natrecor has become the subject of an inquiry by the Justice Department. The company said yesterday that it had received a subpoena from the United States attorney in Massachusetts, Michael J. Sullivan, whose office is known for its prosecution of health care fraud.
2005-07-20	Johnson Hints at Delay in Proposed Deal With Guidant	Johnson & Johnson hinted yesterday at a delay in its planned $25.4 billion purchase of Guidant, which has suffered a drop in market value in the wake of recently disclosed defects in some of its heart defibrillators and pacemakers. Possible changes in the deal were raised as Johnson & Johnson discussed its strong second-quarter earnings yesterday. During a telephone call with analysts, Johnson & Johnson executives said the company was conducting a thorough review of Guidant's problems.
2005-07-17	The Blurry Boundaries Of Growth and Value	HERE'S a tip for followers of investment fashion: Growth is the new value. That is the advice of portfolio managers who believe that the five-year run of underperformance for growth stocks has left them more attractively valued than so-called value stocks. In their view, growth stocks are due for a turnaround, one that recent share price movement suggests may have already begun.
2005-07-16	U.S. Warns Of Dangers From Patch Used for Pain	The government warned yesterday that painkilling skin patches could cause drug overdoses and said it was investigating reports of serious side effects and 120 deaths that might have resulted. The patches, containing the narcotic fentanyl, are marketed under the name Duragesic by Janssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson. A generic version was put on the market in February by Mylan Laboratories. Duragesic had sales of more than $2 billion in 2004.
2005-07-06	When F.D.A. Says Yes, but Insurers Say No	Medical device makers devote years and millions of dollars to winning regulatory approval for new products. But all that work does not necessarily produce the kind of data that persuades insurers to pay for the products once they hit the market. Take what has happened since the Food and Drug Administration gave Johnson & Johnson clearance last fall to sell an implantable spinal disk called the Charité (shar-ee-TAY).
2005-07-06	Senators Ask Drug Giant to Explain Grants to Doctors	The Senate Finance Committee yesterday began an inquiry into whether Johnson & Johnson used educational grants to promote the pediatric use of its former heartburn medication, Propulsid, even as internal company concerns mounted during the 1990's about the drug's safety in some children. The inquiry follows a June 10 article in The New York Times describing how, despite growing evidence linking the drug to heart problems and deaths, the company helped pay for a physician's book recommending Propulsid's use in children and gave grants to pediatric gastroenterology organizations that favored such use.
2005-07-02	Jury Finds Infringements On Patents On Stents	A federal court jury concluded yesterday that Johnson & Johnson's method for coating its Cypher stent with drugs was an infringement on a patent owned by Boston Scientific. The jury also found that the structure of three Johnson & Johnson stents infringed a second patent. Boston Scientific's victory came in the same federal court in Wilmington, Del., where Johnson & Johnson won a ruling last week from a different jury that Boston Scientific's stent delivery devices infringed on two Johnson patents.
2005-06-25	Boston Scientific to Pay $74 Million to Settle U.S. Stent Case	Boston Scientific has agreed to pay $74 million to settle a civil complaint by the Justice Department that it illegally continued to make and sell systems for implanting stents in 1998 even after learning that a significant percentage of them were defective. The settlement, which was announced yesterday by the Justice Department in Boston, did not require the company to admit that it acted improperly. The agreement ends a lengthy inquiry that began as a criminal investigation of Boston Scientific, which is based in Natick, Mass.
2005-06-22	Johnson & Johnson Wins One Round in Stent Battle	A Delaware jury said yesterday that Boston Scientific's major stent models had infringed patents owned by Johnson & Johnson, its archrival in the multibillion-dollar market for the lifesaving devices. Stents are metal cylinders inserted into blood vessels to keep them from closing after blockages have been cleared in a procedure called angioplasty.
2005-06-20	Faulty Heart Devices Force Some Scary Decisions	For Pam Alexson, the decision whether to have a potentially defective heart device removed and replaced was easy. Ms. Alexson, a former nurse in Rehoboth, Mass., who expects to undergo surgery tomorrow, has the same Guidant Corporation defibrillator that failed in a college student who died in March, as well as the same type of genetic heart disease that killed him. But another heart patient with that Guidant unit, Douglas Parsons, said he was holding back, not because he did not want the device out, but because his history of infection pointed to a bigger risk from surgery .
2005-06-20	Implant Troubles Could Affect Takeover Deal	Johnson & Johnson, which agreed in December to buy Guidant for $25.4 billion, is trying to determine whether problems with Guidant's heart devices and its response to them represent a ''materially adverse change'' to Guidant's business, several people involved in the acquisition talks said yesterday. Under the terms of the deal, if Johnson & Johnson finds that the problems are materially damaging, it could renegotiate the deal and pay less for Guidant, these people said. Alternatively, Johnson & Johnson might walk away from the deal, although those people said this was less likely.
2005-06-18	Weirdness And Beauty, Set in Stone; A Sculpture Garden In One Man's Image	Hamilton seems to be leaking sculpture. There is the one in front of the Hamilton Supply store depicting a father teaching a child to ride a bike, and the bike always seems about to teeter into traffic. Newcomers often tap their brakes when they round the turn and see it, there on the sidewalk.
2005-06-15	Panel Urges Limits on Use of a Heart Drug	A panel of cardiologists delivered a setback to Johnson & Johnson, recommending that the company's heart-failure therapy Natrecor not be given to outpatients and calling for a large clinical trial to determine its safety. The panel, led by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School, said the intravenous therapy should be reserved for seriously ill patients arriving at hospitals. The committee warned in particular against regular serial outpatient infusions of the drug, a growing practice in heart-failure treatment clinics that have sprung up.
2005-06-10	Stent From Johnson & Johnson Infringes Patents, Court Rules	Just days before Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson head into a federal court in Delaware for a crucial round in their battle to use patents to control the multibillion-dollar domestic stent market, Boston Scientific has won a related legal skirmish in the Netherlands. Boston Scientific said yesterday that a Dutch court ruled that a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary can be forced to end production of its Cypher stents in the Netherlands and to halt sales of the drug-coated devices there. The court ruled that the catheter system used to deploy Cypher into coronary arteries infringes on patents owned by Boston Scientific.
2005-06-10	Lucrative Drug, Danger Signals And the F.D.A.	Dozens had died and more than 100 patients had suffered serious heart problems by March 1998 after taking Propulsid, a popular medicine for heartburn. Infants, given the drug to treat acid reflux, seemed particularly at risk. Federal officials told Propulsid's manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, that the drug might have to be banned for children, or even withdrawn altogether. Instead, the government and the company negotiated new warnings for the drug's label -- though not nearly as tough as regulators had wanted. Propulsid had a good year anyway. Sales continued to surpass $1 billion. Johnson & Johnson continued to underwrite efforts that promoted Propulsid's use in children. A survey that year found that about 20 percent of babies in neonatal intensive care units were being given the drug.
2005-05-25	F.D.A. Meets With Maker Of Flawed Heart Device	Officials of the Food and Drug Administration and the Guidant Corporation met yesterday to discuss a company defibrillator that has partly or totally failed in 26 cases because of an electrical flaw, including an instance in March that involved the death of a college student. The meeting followed the disclosure that Guidant had not informed doctors for three years about a design flaw in the implantable defibrillator, known as a Ventak Prizm 2 Model 1861, or told them that it had changed its manufacturing process in 2002 to fix it.
2005-05-17	The Marketing Of a Tuneup For the Heart; Issues Arise as Drug's Use Goes Beyond Emergencies	When the Food and Drug Administration approved an expensive treatment for heart failure patients in 2001, its maker hailed it as potentially useful to as many as a million Americans who show up every year in hospital emergency rooms gasping for air and barely able to walk. But the drug, Natrecor, made by the Scios unit of Johnson & Johnson, has also become widely used by thousands of patients in outpatient clinics around the country, where heart failure patients receive regular infusions, sometimes weekly or more often, over several months.
2005-05-05	Cleveland Clinic Panel Gives Heart Failure Drug a Reprieve	The Cleveland Clinic gave an apparent reprieve to a controversial Johnson & Johnson heart failure treatment yesterday when a committee overruled more than four dozen of its cardiologists by deciding that the drug, Natrecor, would remain in use at the clinic. The panel, composed of doctors from various disciplines, overruled the recommendation of about 50 members of the clinic's cardiovascular medicine department, who had voted last week to ban or severely restrict use of Natrecor after two studies in medical journals indicated that it increased the risk of kidney impairment and death.
2005-05-04	Heart Clinic May End Or Curtail Use of a Drug	Heart doctors at the Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's largest centers for cardiac care, have voted unanimously to severely curtail or even ban the clinic's use of the Johnson & Johnson drug Natrecor. The final decision is in the hands of a clinic committee that is expected to review data at a meeting today. Natrecor, widely used as a treatment for heart failure, has been reported in two recent medical journal studies to increase kidney problems and death rates among patients. Last week, the company worked out a plan with federal drug regulators to cite such risks on its label.
2005-04-23	JOHNSON'S DEAL FOR GUIDANT FACES EUROPEAN SCRUTINY	Johnson & Johnson's planned $25.4 billion purchase of the Guidant Corporation will get a four-month review from European Union regulators who want to examine whether the company would dominate the market for treatment of coronary and peripheral artery diseases and cardiac surgery. ''This takeover involves two companies that are at the forefront of product development in a fast-growing part of the medical device industry,'' the European Commission said yesterday. United States regulators have also asked for more details about the deal. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J. Guidant is based in Indianapolis.
2005-04-22	British Company to Buy U.S. Maker of Anemia Treatment	Shire Pharmaceuticals Group, a British drug company, agreed to pay $1.6 billion in cash to acquire Transkaryotic Therapies, an American company that has developed its own version of an anemia-fighting protein that is the biotechnology industry's biggest-selling product. The deal, announced yesterday, represents a substantial move into biotechnology by Shire, best known for its Adderall drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
2005-04-20	Some in Biotech Prefer an Acquisition to an I.P.O.	Starting a company and taking it public has long been the goal of many biotechnology entrepreneurs and the venture capitalists that back them. Now, though, with the stock market unreceptive and pharmaceutical companies desperate for new products, some small privately held biotech companies are opting for a more certain if potentially less spectacular payoff: selling themselves to larger companies.
2005-04-20	Pfizer Earnings Plunge 87% On Painkillers' Problems	The world's largest drug maker, Pfizer, reported sharply lower first-quarter earnings yesterday, partly because of the fallout from its controversial cox-2 inhibitor painkillers, Bextra and Celebrex. The company took a $766 million charge related to the withdrawal of Bextra from the market and reported lower sales of its other arthritis drug, Celebrex.
2005-04-12	Popular Drugs For Dementia Tied to Deaths	Older patients with dementia who are given antipsychotic medicines are far more likely to die prematurely than those given dummy pills, federal drug regulators said Monday. The warning adds to growing worries about the safety of the widely prescribed drugs. The Food and Drug Administration said that it would now require manufacturers of the medicines to place black-box warnings -- the agency's most severe -- on the labels of all the drugs. In 2003, the agency required manufacturers to add a warning about an increased risk of diabetes from antipsychotic medications.
2005-04-10	From Band-Aids To Biotech	FOR generations, Johnson & Johnson has been known for Band-Aids and baby powder. It invented the first-aid kit and created the universally recognized scent of a baby. But these days, the fortunes of New Jersey's largest company lie not as much in the nursery or drug store aisle as in high-tech medical devices and biotech drugs -- at once a more lucrative but riskier path. Johnson & Johnson, a mixed bag of 200 operating companies with combined sales of $47.3 billion last year, markets everything from Neutrogena and Aveeno skin creams to over-the-counter medicines like Imodium, Tylenol and Motrin to Reach toothbrushes, Stayfree Maxipads and the sugar substitute Splenda.
2005-04-10	The Family Behind the Company	JOHNSON & JOHNSON calls itself a family of companies. Business aside, Johnson & Johnson's colorful founding family has made a lasting mark on New Jersey. Founded in 1886 by three brothers -- Robert Wood Johnson, James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson -- the company remained fully under family control until 1944, when it began to sell shares to the public.
2005-04-08	F.D.A. APPROVES PATIENT TRIAL FOR ABBOTT HEART STENT	Abbott Laboratories won regulatory approval to enroll patients in a study comparing its experimental drug-coated heart stent to Taxus, the market's top seller, from the Boston Scientific Corporation. The study will involve 1,670 patients at 80 centers, the company said. Abbott said it hoped to win Food and Drug Administration approval for its device, called ZoMaxx, in the second half of 2007. Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., is seeking entry into the $5 billion-a-year market for stents, tiny mesh tubes designed to prop open cleared arteries. Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson are currently the only companies selling drug-coated stents in the United States.
2005-04-04	Splenda, the Artificial Sweetener, Adds a Brown Sugar Blend	Splenda, the popular artificial sweetener, is going brown. The manufacturer of Splenda, the brand name given to the chemical sweetener sucralose, is releasing a version that can be used as a replacement for brown sugar. It will be called Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.
2005-04-02	JOHNSON & JOHNSON ISSUES ALZHEIMER'S DRUG WARNING	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it was warning doctors about the deaths of 13 people who took its Alzheimer's drug Reminyl. The deaths occurred during clinical studies to test the drug's effectiveness in treating mild cognitive impairment, a form of memory loss. The drug has been used to treat two million people for Alzheimer's since it was approved in 2001. The company said it had mailed letters to thousands of doctors after negotiations with the Food and Drug Administration. Johnson & Johnson has also amended its packaging insert to disclose the deaths. During the two-year studies, 13 participants taking Reminyl died while one patient who received a placebo died. The clinical trials involved about 2,000 patients in 16 countries. Stephanie Saul (NYT)
2005-04-01	AKZO ENDS DEAL TO SELL DRUG MADE BY JOHNSON & JOHNSON	Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemical and drug maker, ended an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to sell the antipsychotic drug Risperdal in Europe, Argentina and Brazil, saying that it was working on competing drugs with Pfizer. Akzo's Organon pharmaceutical unit is working with Pfizer on the drug Asenapine, which may compete with Risperdal. The two companies have collaborated on the product since 1993. An Akzo Nobel spokesman, John de Munnik, said that the company would continue to receive royalty payments from Johnson & Johnson for an undefined time because it had helped Johnson & Johnson create the market for Risperdal in Europe, Argentina and Brazil. Akzo is based in Arnhem, the Netherlands, and Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2005-03-31	Subpoenas Seek Data on Orthopedics Makers' Ties to Surgeons	Several large orthopedics manufacturers said yesterday that they had received subpoenas from the Justice Department, seeking information about the industry's relationships with surgeons who implant artificial knees and hips. Stryker, a manufacturer based in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that it had received a request on Monday for documents that covered any agreement since January 2002 that called for it to pay knee and hip surgeons for consulting, services or other work. The request also covered arrangements with medical students in orthopedic training who were using or considering using Stryker's products to replace or reconstruct hips and knees.
2005-03-25	JURY RULES AGAINST BOSTON SCIENTIFIC IN PATENT CASE	A federal court jury said yesterday that Boston Scientific's Nir stent infringed a basic patent held by Johnson & Johnson on such metal mesh devices, which are implanted to prop open coronary blood vessels. The case was a retrial of a lawsuit that Johnson won in 2000, when it was awarded $324 million. That jury verdict was set aside in 2002 by Judge Sue L. Robinson of United States District Court in Wilmington, Del. Boston Scientific said that it no longer made the Nir and that yesterday's loss would not affect its current business. Still, it will appeal the verdict, it said. A far more crucial case, in which Johnson claims that Boston's best-selling drug-eluting stent, the Taxus, also infringes its patents, is scheduled for June. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)
2005-03-22	Popular Heart Drug Impairs Kidney Action, Study Says	Johnson & Johnson's popular treatment for congestive heart failure, Natrecor, became the latest drug swept up in questions about safety yesterday when an article in the journal Circulation said that the drug had reduced kidney function. An accompanying editorial in the journal, published by the American Heart Association, questioned why the Food and Drug Administration had failed to follow up on concerns about Natrecor's impact on the kidneys and suggested that the drug should have received stronger labeling when it was approved in 2001.
2005-03-07	Data Support Broader Use Of Heart Stents	New clinical research results on the performance of stents, reported yesterday at the nation's largest annual meeting for heart doctors, support broader use of the devices, which prop open coronary blood vessels after they are cleared of blockages. The reports at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando, Fla., also suggested that the Boston Scientific Corporation, the market leader, will face increasingly tough competition from two more diversified health care rivals, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic Inc.
2005-03-05	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUY CLOSURE MEDICAL	Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy the Closure Medical Corporation, a maker of medical glue, for $370 million, the companies said yesterday. Johnson & Johnson said it would pay $27 in cash for each share of Closure Medical, 21 percent more than the company's closing share price on Thursday. Closure, based in Raleigh, N.C., makes Dermabond, which replaces sutures and staples for wounds, and Liquid Bandage. The deal comes just weeks after the company's Omnex surgical sealant, its first product for use inside the body, was approved in Europe. Johnson & Johnson already has alliances with Closure Medical, distributing Liquid Bandage under Johnson's Band-Aid brand name and marketing Dermabond. Closure Medical shares rose $4.28 to $26.68. Shares of Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., gained 99 cents, to $67.74.
2005-02-23	Memo Emerges As a Key Part Of Bias Lawsuit	At Johnson & Johnson, the director of equal opportunity was worried. The company, she warned in a memo written in the late 1990's -- the exact date is unclear -- had ''areas of vulnerability'' to employment discrimination lawsuits. As it turned out, she was right. And the memo, written by Marion HochbergSmith and intended to prod Johnson & Johnson, the giant drug company, into making improvements, could now end up serving as an unintended legal weapon against it. That memo, along with other documents submitted to a federal court in New Jersey, emerged publicly yesterday in support of a motion to certify a lawsuit filed in 2001 by several African-American and Hispanic employees as a class action. The documents open a rare window into the workings of a big company coping with how to hire and promote fairly.
2005-02-17	Federal Panel Consolidates Vioxx Suits	Hundreds of individual and class-action lawsuits filed in federal courts against Merck, blaming its painkiller Vioxx for deaths and injuries, will be consolidated in a federal court in New Orleans before a judge that many plaintiffs' lawyers had hoped would receive the case. The consolidation order that funneled the cases to Judge Eldon E. Fallon, 66, was issued yesterday by a seven-member administrative body of federal judges that rules on motions to centralize nationwide legal battles.
2005-01-26	J.&J. RENAMING ALZHEIMER'S DRUG AFTER MIX-UPS	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would give a new name to Reminyl, its drug for treating Alzheimer's disease, after two patients died when they were mistakenly given a similar-sounding diabetes drug. The deaths were caused by hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, when the Alzheimer's patients were accidentally given the drug Amaryl, a product of Sanofi-Aventis, instead of Reminyl. The company and the Food and Drug Administration have not yet agreed on the new name, but it is expected to be introduced by the end of March, Mr. Arbesfeld said. Stephanie Saul (NYT)
2005-01-22	Safety Concerns Reported On J.&J. Alzheimer's Drug	Regulators are reviewing the safety of the Alzheimer's disease drug Reminyl after data from two clinical trials indicated that people taking the drug had a much higher death rate than those taking a placebo. The review was announced yesterday by Johnson & Johnson, which said it was in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration and regulators in Europe and Canada.
2005-01-15	F.D.A. Panel Votes Against Sale of Statins Over Counter	A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended against the over-the-counter sale of a Merck cholesterol-lowering drug, saying that while millions of Americans could benefit from taking it, they should not begin such a regimen without a doctor's advice. The F.D.A. typically heeds such recommendations, meaning that the drug industry has been at least temporarily thwarted from creating a new segment of the drug market. But Merck and its partner in the application, Johnson & Johnson, said they would continue trying to win approval.
2005-01-13	Trying for an Over-Counter Cholesterol Drug	Take two statins and call me in the morning. That twist on the old advice from the doctor could soon be possible, if two giant drug companies get their wish.
2005-01-12	Small Clinical Trial Gives Johnson & Johnson Stent a Bit of a Lift	The clinical trial was a small one in Germany dealing with an increasingly rare medical problem. But Johnson & Johnson hopes the results, published late yesterday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, will aid its drive to erode Boston Scientific's dominance in the $5 billion market for drug-coated stents. Stents are mesh cylinders inserted in blood vessels to prop them open after blockages are cleared. The new report studied the small subset of patients who receive a bare metal stent but need further treatment after new blockages develop within their stent.
2005-01-08	Judge Sides With Floss in Suit	A federal judge yesterday barred Pfizer from using commercials that state that its Listerine mouthwash works as well as dental floss in fighting plaque. The campaign ''poses a public health risk,'' said the judge, Denny Chin, of Federal District Court in Manhattan.
2004-12-29	IMMUNOGEN TO LICENSE TUMOR TECHNOLOGY TO CENTOCOR	ImmunoGen, a biotechnology company specializing in cancer treatments, said yesterday that Centocor, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, has agreed to buy rights to a tumor technology in an agreement worth as much as $43.5 million. ImmunoGen, based in Cambridge, Mass., said it would get an initial payment of $1 million and additional research fees of as much as $42.5 million. Centocor would be responsible for the development and marketing of products from the license, the company said. ImmunoGen already has similar agreements with Biogen Idec and Genentech. The ImmunoGen technology involves attaching a potent cell-killing agent to an antibody that carries it to cancer cells, which are then killed.
2004-12-29	J.&J. Submits Drug	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had applied for the first approval in the United States of a prescription treatment for premature ejaculation, the most common sexual dysfunction in men. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., acquired the drug, dapoxetine, in 2000 from PPD Inc.
2004-12-22	A Something Among the Sweet Nothings; Splenda Is Leaving Other Sugar Substitutes With That Empty Feeling	Lance Collins, the chief executive of Fuze Beverage, had planned to introduce three more flavors in the company's fast-growing line of Slenderize juice and tea drinks next year. But now, he will introduce only one. Cadbury Schweppes will be selling two new Snapple flavors beginning in January but is rethinking what other new products it will be able to offer next year.
2004-12-17	J.&J.'s a Big Deal In Year's Mergers	Shares of Johnson & Johnson rose sharply yesterday after the company agreed to acquire Guidant, the maker of devices to treat heart and circulatory illnesses, for $25.4 billion. The deal is one of the biggest in an extraordinary escalation of merger activity. Yesterday, Symantec and Veritas Software announced a $13.5 billion deal, and Noble Energy said it was buying Patina Oil and Gas for $2.76 billion.
2004-12-16	J.&J. in Deal To Buy Guidant For $25 Billion	Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical and health care giant, announced late last night that it had agreed to buy Guidant, one of the nation's largest makers of devices to treat heart and circulatory illnesses, for $25.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $76 in cash and stock for each share of Guidant, a company that was spun off from Eli Lilly in 1994. Slightly more than a third of the offer is said to be in cash.
2004-12-13	Johnson & Johnson and Guidant Hold More Talks on Acquisition	Johnson & Johnson, the health care conglomerate, continued its acquisition talks with Guidant, one of the nation's largest makers of devices to treat heart and circulatory illnesses, over the weekend, and a deal could be reached within days, executives close to the negotiations said last night. Several sticking points remain, the executives cautioned, including some last-minute haggling over price. Johnson & Johnson has offered to pay $75 a share, or about $24 billion, the executives said.
2004-12-08	Johnson & Johnson Decides It Needs Devices	Johnson & Johnson has made dozens of mostly small acquisitions over the last decade, expanding its portfolio of more than 200 businesses that make products like Band-Aids, artificial knees and blockbuster drugs. Now, in negotiating to buy Guidant, a leading manufacturer of implantable devices to treat heart and circulatory illnesses, Johnson & Johnson is looking for a crucial acquisition to increase its presence in the lucrative, fast-growing market for medical devices.
2004-12-02	JOHNSON & JOHNSON HALTS EFFORT ON NEW USES OF DRUG	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had abandoned efforts to develop its Topamax epilepsy medicine as a treatment for obesity and diabetes after studies showed it was not effective. The company, based in New Brunswick, N.J., said the decision was not based on safety issues and would not affect the use of Topamax as an approved treatment for epilepsy or migraines. Topamax generated $1.03 billion in worldwide sales in the first three quarters of this year. Johnson & Johnson had been testing a controlled-release form of Topamax in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes.
2004-11-30	F.D.A. APPROVES GIVEN IMAGING'S CAMERA IN A PILL	Given Imaging said yesterday that the Food and Drug Administration had approved use of a new camera in a pill as a tool for diagnosing diseases of the esophagus. The combination camera and radio transmitter, called PillCam, is about the size of a large vitamin pill. Given, based in Israel, said that the device snapped about 14 pictures a second for about 20 minutes after it was swallowed. PillCam software translates the transmitted data into a color video displayed on a computer monitor. PillCam is being marketed as a less invasive alternative to endoscopy, a procedure in which a camera mounted on a long plastic tube is inserted in the throat after a patient is sedated. Given said that the approval released a $10 million progress payment from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary that has rights to distribute and market PillCam everywhere except Japan. Barnaby Feder (NYT)
2004-10-27	Artificial Spinal Disk Gains Approval From the F.D.A.	The Food and Drug Administration yesterday permitted a unit of Johnson & Johnson to market an artificial spinal disk in the United States as a new form of treatment for people with severe lower back pain. The disc, called the Charité (pronounced shar-ee-TAY), represents the first of a wave of such devices that are expected to become available over the next decade as an alternative to spinal fusion surgery.
2004-10-21	One Stent Maker Thrives as Rival Gets the Kudos	Boston Scientific provided fresh evidence in its strong quarterly earnings report Tuesday that it reigns supreme in the market for drug-coated stents, the tiny mesh cylinders that cardiologists insert into arteries to keep them open once blockages have been cleared. Led by Taxus, the company's drug-coated stent, Boston Scientific's sales of stents reached $686 million, more than five times its stent sales for the quarter a year ago.
2004-10-10	Corporate Citizenship And Profits Can Mix	To the Editor: Re ''Charting a Course in a Sea of Demands'' (Armchair M.B.A., Sept. 26), which described how chief executives were coming under fire to change their companies' ways:
2004-10-02	JOHNSON & JOHNSON UNIT RECEIVES FEDERAL SUBPOENA	Johnson & Johnson's Ortho Biotech Products unit has received a subpoena from the Department of Health and Human Services requesting marketing materials used to promote the company's Procrit cancer medicine. Procrit is used to combat anemia by increasing production of red blood cells in cancer patients. Johnson & Johnson, of New Brunswick, N.J., is cooperating with the request, it said. Sales of Procrit and a European version called Eprex fell 14 percent in the second quarter because of competition from Amgen's Aranesp drug, Johnson & Johnson said in July. The company said in August that it had received a request from the office of the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, for documents on the sales, marketing and clinical trials of Procrit and five other drugs.
2004-10-01	F.D.A. ALLOWS EXTENDED USE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON MEDICINE	Johnson & Johnson won expanded approval to market Remicade, which it began selling in 1998, for patients who have been newly diagnosed with the crippling joint disorder rheumatoid arthritis. The Food and Drug Administration previously cleared the drug only for patients who were not helped by methotrexate, an older treatment for the disease, the company said. Worldwide sales of Remicade increased to $539 million in the second quarter, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier.
2004-09-30	Trouble With Anemia Drug Is Reduced, but Issues Remain	The incidence of a rare but serious side effect associated with Eprex, an anemia drug from Johnson & Johnson that is sold overseas, has been sharply reduced by changes in the packaging and administration of the drug, two teams of scientists said yesterday. But the damage to Johnson & Johnson's sales might not be reversed as easily. And the incident has raised questions about the monitoring of drugs already on the market and about the safety of drug imports.
2004-09-15	JOHNSON & JOHNSON WARNED ABOUT PAIN PATCH CLAIMS	Johnson & Johnson made false or misleading claims about its Duragesic pain-relief skin patch, according to a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration. The complaints center on a promotional card that has been distributed to doctors since 2003, said Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceutica unit, which makes the patch. The agency said Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., overstated claims of less risk of abuse and fewer side effects than other painkillers. ''We're working closely with the F.D.A. to address their concerns as quickly as possible,'' Ms. Goodrich said.
2004-08-28	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUY MAKER OF SKIN CARE PRODUCTS	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Biapharm, a French manufacturer of skin care products. Biapharm controls Laboratoire Medix, which makes a line of wound-treatment emulsions under the Biafine brand. Its United States subsidiary is Medix Pharmaceuticals Americas Inc., based in Largo, Fla. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Johnson & Johnson Consumer France said the deal was expected to close by the end of September, subject to regulatory approvals. Johnson's French unit, a marketer of skin care brands like RoC and Neutrogena, has 542 employees. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2004-08-27	Glaxo Agrees to Post Results Of Drug Trials on Web Site	In a settlement that the New York attorney general said would transform the drug industry, GlaxoSmithKline agreed yesterday to post on its Web site the results of all clinical trials involving its drugs. ''This settlement is transformational in that it will provide doctors and patients access to the clinical testing data necessary to make informed judgments,'' the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said.
2004-08-23	How to Make Pain Relief Cool: Add Ski Bunnies and Mint Flavor	Visitors to Times Square earlier this month were greeted by an unusual giveaway, when young women in fur-trimmed ski bunny outfits handed out samples not of gum or of MTV products -- the usual youth-oriented fare -- but of small packs of Tylenol. Granted, this was Tylenol with a twist. The pills were Tylenol Cool Caplets, adult-strength headache tablets with a strong mint taste. The new flavor, described as ''instant cooling'' in advertisements, is one element of a campaign to make the Tylenol brand more hip and, as the name suggests, more cool.
2004-08-13	F.D.A. ALLOWS EPILEPSY DRUG TO BE SOLD FOR MIGRAINES	Johnson & Johnson received federal approval to market its Topamax epilepsy pills for preventing migraine headaches. The Food and Drug Administration cleared Topamax for the added use after two clinical trials showed daily doses of the drug reduced the number of migraine episodes, said Stephanie Scott, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson. The approval adds the United States to a list of 22 countries that allow Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, to promote Topamax for use against migraines. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2004-08-04	Spitzer Asks Drug Maker For Off-Label Use Material	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, had asked for information about six of its drugs, including marketing materials, the results of clinical trials and data on prescriptions for so-called off-label use. Johnson & Johnson is the third drug company to come under scrutiny from Mr. Spitzer in recent months over its handling of clinical trial data and drug marketing practices. Mr. Spitzer has previously said that he planned to use legal action or the threat of legal action to force greater industry disclosure of clinical trial findings, an issue that has drawn intense public interest.
2004-07-28	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUILD $650 MILLION PLANT IN IRELAND	Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest maker of medical devices, will build a $650 million plant in Ireland to make Remicade, a drug used to treat illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., will employ 330 people at the plant in County Cork within five years, Ireland's deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, said in a statement. The factory, to be paid for partly by the government, will be completed by 2010.
2004-06-03	JOHNSON & JOHNSON SPINAL DISK CLOSER TO F.D.A. APPROVAL	Johnson & Johnson moved closer to winning the first Food and Drug Administration approval of an artificial spinal disk, a device intended to replace natural cushioning between vertebrae. An F.D.A. advisory committee meeting in Gaithersburg, Md., voted 8-0 to recommend that the agency approve the company's Charite device. The F.D.A. often accepts the advice of its panels. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2004-05-19	Technology Briefing | Biotechnology: Boston Scientific Releases Stent Sales Figures	The Boston Scientific Corporation, the world's largest maker of stents to keep open blood vessels that lead to and from the heart, said yesterday that it had sold about $78 million of its Taxus drug-coated version of the device in the first two weeks of May in the United States. Boston Scientific said in February that it expected 2004 worldwide coated-stent sales would be $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion, up from $195 million in 2003. The company, which is based in Natick, Mass., won approval on March 4 to sell its Taxus product in the United States and it began selling it on March 8. The latest sales extend the device to all 1,200 United States customer accounts that Boston Scientific had planned to reach, a Morgan Stanley analyst, Glenn Reicin, said in a note to investors. The company said that it had overtaken Johnson & Johnson as the nation's No.1 stent maker. Johnson & Johnson does not provide weekly sales figures. Shares of Boston Scientific fell 65 cents, to $38.98. Johnson & Johnson shares fell 7 cents, to $54.63.
2004-05-14	JUDGMENT AGAINST JOHNSON & JOHNSON VOIDED	Johnson & Johnson has persuaded the Mississippi Supreme Court to throw out a $100 million jury award to users of the Propulsid heartburn medicine in the first case involving the drug to go to trial. Mississippi's high court concluded late yesterday that a judge in the September 2001 trial improperly combined the accusations of 10 consumers that the drug caused an irregular heartbeat. The company halted pharmacy sales of Propulsid in July 2000, after the drug was linked to at least 300 deaths. Jurors in a state court in Port Gibson, Miss., found that a Johnson & Johnson unit sold Propulsid knowing that some users experienced dangerous side effects when taking it with other drugs and awarded the former users $10 million each. The judge in the case had already slashed the total award to $48 million. Lawyers for the former Propulsid users said they intended to retry the cases separately.
2004-05-12	Makers of Drug-Coated Stents Fight For the Hearts of Cardiologists	Johnson & Johnson is in danger of once again becoming an also-ran in a market it pioneered. Having introduced in the United States a promising new drug-coated device to treat heart disease nearly a year before anyone else, the company has already lost its lead, analysts say. The Boston Scientific Corporation, which introduced a rival device two months ago, said it had captured about 70 percent of new orders. In April alone, the company said its United States revenue for the device was $163 million, with an additional $42 million overseas.
2004-05-05	F.D.A. Wants More Study on 2 Drugs for Anemia	An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that more study would be needed to determine whether Amgen's and Johnson & Johnson's widely used anemia drugs for cancer patients can actually make their cancer worse. But the committee did not discuss placing any restrictions on the use of the drugs or additional warnings on their labels. Johnson & Johnson's Procrit and Amgen's Aranesp are used to treat the anemia caused by chemotherapy. The products are among the best-selling drugs in the world, with annual sales of several billion dollars.
2004-02-28	F.D.A. EXTENDS MERCK'S RIGHTS TO MARKET PAINKILLER	Merck & Company said the Food and Drug Administration granted an additional six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States for the painkiller Vioxx. The decision was made in response to a supplemental new-drug application the company filed based on studies involving juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Merck said. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., filed in December for approval to sell Arcoxia, its successor to Vioxx, to stay competitive in the market for painkillers. Separately, Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, said it would buy Merck's 50 percent stake in their 13-year-old European joint venture, Johnson & Johnson MSD Europe, which sells over-the-counter medicines. Terms were not disclosed. Merck will continue to receive royalties on some products under the agreement, the companies said.
2004-02-26	2 Cancer Drugs, No Comparative Data	Nearly two years into the planning of a head-to-head federal test of two expensive widely used cancer drugs, not a single patient has been enrolled in the study. But in a sense there is no hurry: Congress has barred the government from using the results in deciding how much to pay for the drugs. Medicare officials sought the study, hoping to see if Aranesp, a drug made by Amgen that costs about $1,300 a vial, is superior to Johnson & Johnson's Procrit, an earlier version of the drug that costs $470 a vial. The federal Medicare program spends more than $1 billion a year on the two drugs, which stimulate the bone marrow to produce red blood cells in patients who have become anemic during treatment for kidney disease or cancer.
2004-02-25	Johnson Takes Ally to Try to Keep Lead in Stents	With Boston Scientific poised to introduce a drug-coated device to keep coronary arteries open, Johnson & Johnson is scrambling to protect its lead in what is likely to soon be a $3 billion market. Johnson & Johnson, the first company to get approval for the new drug-coated stent, as the device is called, said yesterday that it had joined forces with another competitor, Guidant, to sell its Cypher stent.
2004-02-20	BRITISH COMPANY TO BUY PLANT FROM JOHNSON & JOHNSON	Tate & Lyle, a British maker of cereal sweeteners and starches, will buy a plant from Johnson & Johnson for $134 million to increase sales of ingredients to food and drink companies. Tate & Lyle, based in London, said the deal involved a plant in McIntosh, Ala., that makes Splenda sweetener. The McNeil Nutritionals unit of Johnson & Johnson will keep control of the brand. The companies collaborated on the development of the sweetener for more than 20 years. They have agreed to split sales, with the British company focusing on the food and beverages industry and McNeil selling to retail and food services clients. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2004-02-06	JOHNSON & JOHNSON UNIT OFFERS TO SETTLE SUITS	Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceutica unit said yesterday that it would pay $69.5 million to $90 million to settle lawsuits stemming from its Propulsid heartburn medicine, which was pulled from shelves in 2000. In addition, Janssen is paying up to $37.5 million for administrative and legal fees for the plaintiffs' committee, which represents about 4,000 people. The Food and Drug Administration has warned that Propulsid can cause irregular heartbeats and sudden death. The settlement requires approval by at least 85 percent of 300 death claims and 75 percent of the remaining plaintiffs, according to Johnson & Johnson and the plaintiffs' committee. Aside from the 4,000 plaintiffs already covered by the committee, there are 12,000 people who have not filed lawsuits, but must agree to participate in the settlement before it becomes effective.
2004-02-01	Making Drugs, Shaping the Rules	THE drug industry has created vast markets for products like Viagra, Celebrex and Vioxx by spending billions of dollars on consumer advertising. But to sell medicines that treat schizophrenia, the companies focus on a much smaller group of customers: state officials who oversee treatment for many people with serious mental illness. Those patients -- in mental hospitals, at mental health clinics and on Medicaid -- make states among the largest buyers of antipsychotic drugs.
2004-01-24	JOHNSON & JOHNSON GETS SUBPOENA ON SCHIZOPHRENIA DRUG	Johnson & Johnson said that it had received a federal subpoena for documents related to Risperdal, the most-prescribed schizophrenia medication in the nation. The subpoena, which was sent to the company's Janssen Pharmaceutica division, came from investigators for the Office of Personnel Management, Johnson & Johnson said. Risperdal has been at the center of lawsuits filed by Johnson & Johnson, which is trying to block other companies from making generic copies of the medicine. A patent on the drug is set to expire in 2007. A spokesman for Janssen, Doug Arbesfeld, said that the company was cooperating with the inquiry. Rusty Asher, a spokesman for the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees health benefits for federal employees, said the agency did not comment on active investigations. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2003-12-13	U.S. Subpoenas 2 Drug Makers	Johnson & Johnson and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., a producer of generic medicines, said yesterday that they had received separate subpoenas from federal officials related to the marketing of their drugs. The United States attorney's office in Boston requested documents on the sales and marketing of Johnson & Johnson's Topamax epilepsy drug.
2003-11-30	Corrections	An article on Nov. 16 about television reality shows and documentaries that examine the lives of wealthy young Americans referred incorrectly to the director Spike Jonze, who was compared to Jamie Johnson, the filmmaker and Johnson & Johnson heir. While Mr. Jonze is related to the family that founded the Spiegel catalog (his real name is Adam Spiegel), he is not an heir.
2003-11-27	Drug Company Halts Trials Of Procrit	Several clinical trials of a widely used anemia drug have been halted in the last few weeks after patients developed a higher-than-expected number of blood clots, according to doctors and Johnson & Johnson, the seller of the drug. The development has added more evidence that the drug, Procrit, and perhaps similar drugs sold by Amgen, could pose risks if used more than is necessary to reverse anemia, doctors said. But several doctors said the drugs would not pose a danger if used in appropriate amounts.
2003-11-27	JOHNSON SHIFTS AD AGENCIES ON 4 BRANDS	A division of Johnson & Johnson is changing advertising agencies on four big drug brands with total spending estimated at $200 million. The new agencies replace Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, which was dismissed this month. Campaigns for the Tylenol and St. Joseph brands of analgesics will be created by Deutsch in New York, Marc Monseau, a spokesman for the division, McNeil Consumer and Specialty Pharmaceuticals in Fort Washington, Pa., said yesterday. Deutsch is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. Alchemy in New York, part of the Lowe & Partners division of Interpublic, which creates campaigns for McNeil brands like Motrin and Imodium, will also create ads for the Mylanta and Pepcid brands of antacids.

2003-11-26	No Difference Found In Clotting and Stents	The Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that the rate of blood clots found after implantation of a new drug-coated heart stent was no higher than with other stents. Less than a month ago, the agency issued a second advisory to doctors, cautioning that as many as 60 deaths had been associated with implants of the drug-coated stent, the Cypher, a tiny metal scaffold made by Cordis, a unit of Johnson & Johnson.
2003-11-25	JUDGE BACKS BOSTON SCIENTIFIC IN DEVICE DISPUTE	Shares of the Boston Scientific Corporation, the world's third-largest maker of heart stents, rose 5.3 percent yesterday after a judge denied Johnson & Johnson's bid to keep the company's newest device off the market in the United States. The Taxus drug-coated stent would compete with Johnson & Johnson's Cypher, which now has the United States market to itself. The devices are mesh tubes that prop open arteries cleared in angioplasty procedures. Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Mass., is moving closer to federal approval of Taxus after receiving the recommendation of a government advisory panel last week. Johnson & Johnson has not proved that the introduction of the product will cause ''irreparable harm,'' Judge Sue L. Robinson of Federal District Court in Delaware said. Boston Scientific shares rose $1.79, to $35.70. Shares of Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., rose 60 cents, to $51.48.
2003-11-25	Saatchi & Saatchi Loses Tylenol Account	Days after Saatchi & Saatchi in New York lost its longtime assignment to create campaigns for Tylenol products, the Johnson & Johnson division that sells Tylenol dismissed the agency from its remaining creative assignments, for the Mylanta, Pepcid and St. Joseph brands. Total billings on those brands were estimated at $75 million. Chris Traina, a spokesman at Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe, confirmed reports this week in Advertising Age and Adweek that the agency had lost the creative assignments. He declined to comment further.
2003-11-19	JOHNSON DRUG CLOSER TO APPROVAL FOR MIGRAINE USE	Johnson & Johnson moved closer to selling the seizure medicine Topamax to treat migraines after regulators said they were prepared to clear the new use. The Food and Drug Administration sent a letter to the company, proposing labeling for the drug and requesting analyses of safety results before granting approval, Johnson & Johnson said. Topamax had $687 million in worldwide sales last year, a spokeswoman, Lesley Fishman, said. Topamax is cleared in the United States to treat seizures in combination with another drug. It is used in adults and children ages 2 to 16.
2003-11-18	Saatchi & Saatchi Is Cut From Tylenol Review	The Johnson & Johnson division that sells the Tylenol line of pain relievers has dismissed the brand's United States creative agency of 28 years, Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, by eliminating the agency from a review for the assignment. Billings were estimated at $115 million. Kathy Fallon, a spokeswoman at the Johnson & Johnson division, McNeil Consumer and Specialty Pharmaceuticals in Fort Washington, Pa., yesterday confirmed reports on AdAge.com and Adweek.com that Saatchi had been eliminated but declined to comment further. Chris Traina, a spokesman at Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe, declined to comment.
2003-11-10	Heart Drug Duo Doesn't Cut Complications	Two heart drugs from Johnson & Johnson, Retavase and ReoPro, together did not cut complications in heart attack patients any better than ReoPro alone, a study released yesterday showed. The medicines work in different ways to fight clots that block blood from getting to the heart. Johnson & Johnson sells the products in the United States. Roche Holding of Switzerland and Eli Lilly, based in Indianapolis, have European rights and helped support the research.
2003-11-08	Johnson & Johnson Is Sued By Rival Over Sales Methods	A New York medical device company has accused Johnson & Johnson of antitrust violations in the selling of its surgical devices to hospitals, joining other businesses and government officials that have already been questioning its marketing practices. In a lawsuit filed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the Conmed Corporation, a maker of surgical instruments in Utica, accused Johnson & Johnson of unlawfully coercing hospitals to buy its surgical devices, freezing Conmed out of the market.
2003-10-12	Business; In Search of Savings, Companies Turn to the Sun	JOHNSON & JOHNSON, an icon of American corporate culture, is showing a growing interest in a technology once associated with backwoods cabins and pocket calculators. Like a number of other large companies, Johnson & Johnson has begun to generate its own power from the sun. Solar power has evolved from being an expensive, pie-in-the-sky technology to one that is finally beginning to make business sense. Recent electricity shortages in California, the continuing gyrations in energy prices over all, and new state and federal incentives are among the reasons for companies' efforts to start or expand their use of the technology.
2003-10-07	Johnson Seeks to Halt Generic Contraceptive	Johnson & Johnson, the largest maker of birth-control pills in the United States, has filed suit to block Barr Laboratories Inc. from selling a generic form of its Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo oral contraceptive. Barr, the big maker of generic drugs, filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration in June to sell a generic version of the pill. The 28-tablet package was introduced in September 2002 and has about $110 million in annual sales.
2003-09-06	PFIZER AGREES TO DROP PATENT SUIT AGAINST ANDRX	The Andrx Corporation said Pfizer Inc. agreed to drop a patent-infringement lawsuit so Andrx can introduce a generic version of the Glucotrol XL diabetes drug. Andrx said it would get a royalty-free sublicense under patents owned by Johnson & Johnson's Alza unit and licensed to Pfizer, which is based in New York. Pfizer also agreed to supply Andrx with all strengths of Glucotrol by Jan. 1 so Andrx can sell it as a generic drug. Glucotrol XL had sales of about $320 million last year. The dispute over Andrx's plan to sell a generic form of extended-release glipizide, the main ingredient in Glucotrol, was scheduled to go to trial next month. Stock in Andrx, which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., rose $2.11, or 11 percent, to $20.79.
2003-08-19	Users Discover Pros and Cons In Stair-Climbing Wheelchair	When Dr. Rich Barbara signed up to test the iBOT -- Johnson & Johnson's stair-climbing wheelchair -- in the summer of 2001, he thought he would be reluctant to give it back at the end of the two-week trial. But impressed as he was with its balancing abilities, Dr. Barbara, a 50-year-old paraplegic, found himself yearning for his manual wheelchair. ''I was glad when my two weeks were up,'' said Dr. Barbara, a clinical psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh's Rehabilitation Hospital.
2003-08-12	JOHNSON & JOHNSON DISCLOSES INVESTIGATION OF DRUG UNIT	Johnson & Johnson said the United States attorney's office in New Jersey was investigating marketing practices at the company's Centocor unit, which makes Remicade, a rheumatoid arthritis drug. Prosecutors asked for information and documents on July 2, the company said in a regulatory filing. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., declined to comment on the investigation.
2003-07-22	JOHNSON & JOHNSON SUES RIVAL OVER COMPETING STENT	Johnson & Johnson, the world's top maker of medical devices, has asked a judge to stop the Boston Scientific Corporation from selling a drug-coated stent used to prop open clogged arteries. Johnson & Johnson sought the court order at a pretrial hearing in Wilmington, Del. The company received federal approval in April to sell its Cypher stent in the United States. Boston Scientific is seeking similar approval for its Taxus stent. The companies are suing each other to stop the sale of the rival products.
2003-07-17	New Scrutiny Directed at Bundled Sale of Hospital Supplies	Federal and state investigators are looking into whether large medical-products companies are bundling products for sale to hospitals in ways that may violate antitrust laws. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, said yesterday that his office had expanded its inquiry beyond the business practices of the privately held companies that negotiate contracts for hospital supplies to include some large suppliers themselves.
2003-07-16	JOHNSON & JOHNSON REPORTS 27% DROP IN EARNINGS	Johnson & Johnson said its second-quarter earnings dropped 27 percent on costs for acquisitions and a decline in revenue from its biggest drug, Procrit for anemia. Net income fell to $1.21 billion, or 40 cents a share, from $1.65 billion, or 54 cents a share, in the same period a year ago, said the company, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J. Sales rose 14 percent to $10.3 billion, from $9.07 billion. Revenue from Procrit, also sold as Eprex, declined 7 percent to $1.02 billion as it faced competition from drugs sold by Amgen and Roche Holding.
2003-07-09	Warning on Artery Stent Cites Some Cases of Clots	Johnson & Johnson sent a letter to doctors on Monday night advising them about rare cases of life-threatening blood clots linked to its new drug-coated stent, a fast-selling device used to keep blood flowing through the arteries. The Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that it had received 47 reports of blood-clotting, or thrombosis, that occurred at the time the company's stent was implanted or within a few days. Regulators said five patients had died.
2003-07-01	A New Lens Restores Vision and Brings Relief	For 17 months, Joe Zienowicz lived in a world of darkness and pain, where every eye blink felt like barbed wire and even the dimmest light was an unbearable torment. At 38, Mr. Zienowicz (pronounced ZEN-o-witch) contracted Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe and violent allergic reaction to medicine prescribed for a sore elbow. The disease had blistered his skin, his mucous membranes, even his eyes.
2003-07-01	Johnson & Johnson to Sell Cancer Drug From Millennium Overseas	Johnson & Johnson won the right to sell the cancer drug Velcade, made by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, outside the United States under a deal announced yesterday. In May, Velcade was approved in the United States as a treatment for multiple myeloma, and Millennium expects European approval by next year. Ortho Biotech Products, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, will pay Millennium $15 million up front and as much as $520 million later if Velcade wins approval in various countries for treating multiple myeloma and other types of cancers and if it achieves sales goals.
2003-06-25	F.D.A. FINDS FAULT WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S PROCRIT ADS	Johnson & Johnson used misleading information to advertise its Procrit anemia treatment for chemotherapy patients, federal regulators said. In a letter to Johnson & Johnson's Ortho-Biotech unit, the Food and Drug Administration criticized the company for promotional materials that suggested doctors use Procrit to help anemic chemotherapy patients increase their red blood cell levels to normal. ''We received the communication from the F.D.A. on June 20,'' a company spokesman, Mark Wolfe, said. ''We're assessing the content and working to address the matter as quickly as possible.'' Procrit is cleared only for use in increasing cell numbers from dangerously low levels. There is no data to show an additional benefit for patients treated until they reach a normal blood cell count, the F.D.A. said.
2003-05-10	JOHNSON & JOHNSON NOT LIABLE IN PROPULSID CASE	Johnson & Johnson is not responsible for the death of a 46-year-old man who died two months after he began taking the company's Propulsid heartburn medicine, a California jury decided yesterday. The jury said Propulsid, which was removed from the market in 2000 after being linked to 70 deaths, was not a substantial factor in the death of John Calvert of Napa, Calif. The ruling is the third court victory in a Propulsid case for Johnson & Johnson. The company still faces 750 lawsuits around the country involving the drug. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2003-05-07	JOHNSON & JOHNSON REACHES AGREEMENT TO BUY LINK SPINE	Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy the closely held Link Spine Group for $325 million and future payments, gaining an instrument for treating spinal disorders. Johnson & Johnson will make additional payments based on regulatory and development targets, the company said. The acquisition will result in a charge of $175 million, or 6 cents a share. The purchase will give Johnson & Johnson's DePuy unit an artificial disk used to repair backbones damaged by injury or disease. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2003-01-28	JOHNSON & JOHNSON SETTLES PATENT SUIT FOR $15 MILLION	Johnson & Johnson will pay $15 million and future royalties to settle a lawsuit claiming it infringed a patent for a screw used in spinal implants. Interpore International sued the DePuy AcroMed Inc. unit of Johnson & Johnson, saying the business used technology protected by Interpore patents. DePuy agreed to settle after a federal judge in Santa Ana, Calif., ruled against it, Interpore said. Analysts said the agreement might add as much as 19 cents a share to 2003 earnings and help the company claim more of the market for spinal implants.
2003-01-22	Drug Maker's Profit Up 27%; Sales Also Brisk	Johnson & Johnson reported today that its fourth-quarter profit increased more than 27 percent, citing increased sales of the painkiller Duragesic and the arthritis medicine Remicade. Net income rose to $1.4 billion, or 48 cents a share, the company said, from $1.1 billion, or 36 cents, in the period a year earlier.

2003-01-03	Biotech Company Says It Has Improved 2 Drugs	By applying an artificially accelerated process of evolution in a test tube, a small biotechnology company has developed what it says are improved versions of two of the biotechnology industry's most successful products -- Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis and Rituxan for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The company, Applied Molecular Evolution, is expected to an nounce today that it hopes to sell the improved drugs. However, clinical trials are not expected to begin until 2004 at the earliest and it will take several years for the drugs to reach the market.
2003-01-03	A Rare Chance to Take Back a Market; Johnson & Johnson's New Stent May Dominate Angioplasties	Few companies ever get a second chance once they fall behind the competition on a pivotal product. Johnson & Johnson is about to become an exception to that rule. Early this year, Johnson & Johnson, the giant health care conglomerate that sells everything from Band-Aids to birth control pills, is expected to receive regulatory approval in the United States for a new medical device -- a drug-coated stent that promises drastic changes in the way that hundreds of thousands of patients with heart disease are treated.
2003-01-01	U.S. APPROVES ABBOTT LABORATORIES' ARTHRITIS DRUG	Abbott Laboratories won approval to sell the rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday, allowing the company to challenge Amgen Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. Abbott developed the medication with the Cambridge Antibody Technology Group of Britain. Humira is taken as an injection every other week, while Enbrel from Amgen is taken twice a week. Johnson & Johnson's similar Remicade therapy is administered in doctors' offices.
2002-12-24	Equal hopes to bolster its sales and lift its declining market share with a new campaign.	THE sugar substitute wars are about to get a spoonful of nostalgia. Next week, Equal will begin its first big advertising effort since Cher, Lauren Hutton and Raquel Welch promoted the sugar substitute in the 1990's. In a nod to the campaigns of the past, Equal's newest spokeswoman -- the restaurant owner B. Smith -- takes some potshots at a certain barely veiled competitor for its unpleasant aftertaste.
2002-12-03	French Regulators Limit Use of J.&J. Anemia Drug	French regulators said yesterday that they would restrict the way Johnson & Johnson's anemia drug Eprex could be given to patients with chronic kidney failure because of a rising incidence of a rare but serious side effect. But the regulators stopped short of a more drastic measure they had considered -- banning the use of the drug for such patients. Under the new restrictions, Eprex, which is not sold in the United States, can no longer be given to patients with kidney failure by injection under the skin, only intravenously. The restriction is expected to be adopted by the full European Union.
2002-11-30	Anemia Drug Of Johnson's May Be Limited In Europe	European pharmaceutical regulators are considering banning the use of Johnson & Johnson's anemia drug Eprex for a large class of patients because it is linked to a rare but serious side effect, according to European officials and documents. Such a move -- which would stop the use of the drug by patients with chronic kidney failure -- could mean several hundred million dollars in lost sales for Johnson & Johnson and a potential bonanza for Roche and Amgen, each of which sells a similar drug.
2002-11-21	F.D.A. PANEL BACKS NEW JOHNSON & JOHNSON WHEELCHAIR	Johnson & Johnson won the backing yesterday of a government panel for iBOT, a wheelchair that climbs stairs safely and lifts users to eye level with people who are standing. A Food and Drug Administration panel voted 12 to 0 to recommend that the agency approve the iBOT. The F.D.A. usually accepts its panels' recommendations. The agency gave a faster-than-usual review to the iBOT application, which Johnson & Johnson filed on July 30.
2002-11-14	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUY DRUG MAKER FOR $110 MILLION	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had agreed to buy OraPharma for about $110 million to increase its share of the market for medicines that treat diseases of the mouth. OraPharma investors will receive $7.41 for each share held, or 63 percent more than OraPharma's closing price on Tuesday. Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., will gain OraPharma's Arestin, a time-released antibiotic used to treat periodontal disease. The acquisition will probably not have a material impact on revenue or earnings, Johnson & Johnson said. OraPharma is based in Warminster, Pa.
2002-10-29	Approval Is Seen for Abbott Arthritis Drug	Abbott Laboratories' experimental drug for rheumatoid arthritis proved effective and safe in late-stage clinical trials, making it a potentially strong competitor to Amgen's Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade, doctors and analysts said yesterday and over the weekend. Abbott's drug, Humira, is expected to win approval by the Food and Drug Administration early next year. If it does well in the market, it would raise questions about the wisdom of Amgen's nearly $10 billion acquisition of Immunex, which was done mainly to obtain Enbrel.
2002-10-25	Disease Related To Anemia Drug	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that the number of suspected cases of a rare disease associated with its anemia drug Eprex had risen to 160 as of the end of July from 141 as of the end of May. But the company said that while it was too soon to cite a trend, the number of cases appears to be ''flattening.'' Eprex, which is sold only outside the United States, has been associated with pure red-cell aplasia, a condition that can destroy a person's ability to produce red blood cells, leaving them dependent on transfusions to survive. Although the drug has been on the market more than a decade, almost all the cases have occurred since 1999 and Johnson & Johnson has not been able to identify the reason for this increase. Other drugs similar to Eprex, including those sold in the United States, have been associated with only a few cases of aplasia.
2002-10-19	Johnson & Johnson to Pay $150 Million in Amgen Suit	An arbitrator yesterday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay Amgen $150 million for violating terms of a licensing agreement. But the arbitrator denied a request by Amgen to terminate Johnson & Johnson's right to sell the product in question, an anemia treatment that is Johnson & Johnson's top-selling drug. The ruling by a former federal judge, Frank McGarr, is the latest in a long dispute between the companies over erythropoietin, or EPO, the most lucrative drug ever produced by the biotechnology industry. It is sold by Amgen as Epogen and by Johnson & Johnson in the United States as Procrit.
2002-10-16	Standing Out in Its Industry, Johnson & Johnson Reports Strong Quarter	In sharp contrast to its struggling rivals in the pharmaceutical industry, Johnson & Johnson reported double-digit earnings growth yesterday and told analysts to expect strong results for the year. The company said it earned $1.8 billion, or 60 cents a share, for the third quarter, an increase of nearly 19 percent over the comparable period last year.
2002-10-06	A Bandage That Just Fades Away	WHAT'S the worst part of wearing an adhesive bandage? Probably the ''ouch'' factor, while pulling it off. Johnson & Johnson is trying to eliminate that with the Band-Aid Liquid Bandage, a liquid version of the traditional Band-Aid.
2002-10-02	Mystery Effect In Biotech Drug Puts Its Maker On Defensive	As director of hematology at the Hôtel Dieu hospital here, Nicole Casadevall had seen such cases before. A patient in her 60's had developed pure red cell aplasia, in which the body's germ-fighting defenses go haywire and attack its own bone marrow, leaving her severely anemic and facing a lifetime of transfusions to survive. Dr. Casadevall knew of several diseases -- lymphoid cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus -- that could cause red cell aplasia. But this patient had none of them. Indeed, the woman had regularly been injected with a drug to stimulate the production of red blood cells while she received dialysis twice a week. Why, then, was she now unable to make any red blood cells at all?
2002-09-10	JOHNSON & JOHNSON REPORTS DRUG FAILED TEST	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would not seek Food and Drug Administration approval to market the Topamax epilepsy drug for use in bipolar disorder, or manic depression, because it was not effective in a study. Johnson & Johnson said it would seek F.D.A. approval to promote Topamax for two other new uses: as migraine prevention and as a stand-alone epilepsy treatment. Topamax is now approved in the United States as an add-on treatment for epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes seizures.
2002-08-30	People	* Mike Fazende was named to the new post of executive creative director at the Johnson Group, Chattanooga, Tenn. He had been principal and creative director at Publicis in Mid America in Dallas, part of the American operations of the Publicis Groupe. * Ginger Taylor, associate strategist on the General Electric account at OMD, New York, a media services unit of the Omnicom Group, was named print director to lead a new unit dedicated to the consumer print buying business of Johnson & Johnson. The assignment is being transferred to OMD from the Advanswers division of PHD, another Omnicom media agency.
2002-08-27	ALKERMES, DRUG MAKER, CUTS ITS STAFF BY 23%	Alkermes, which makes long-acting drugs, laid off 122 people, or 23 percent of its staff, after federal regulators rejected a schizophrenia treatment last month that it had developed with Johnson & Johnson. Cutting its work force to 419 employees from 541 will save the company, based in Cambridge, Mass., $20 million to $25 million in fiscal 2003, before revamping expenses, and $40 million to $45 million in 2004, Alkermes said. The company said revenue would be lower than it expected after federal regulators in July rejected its Risperdal Consta medicine, a twice-a-month version of Johnson & Johnson's antipsychotic drug Risperdal.
2002-07-30	Rebellious Bodies Dim the Glow of 'Natural' Biotech Drugs	The promise of many biotechnology drugs is that they are the body's own solutions. Human proteins like insulin and growth hormones, the same substances that the body uses every day, are made through genetic engineering and given to people who do not make enough of the proteins on their own. But an outbreak of serious illnesses linked to the anemia drug Eprex shows that some patients do not react to genetically engineered proteins as if they were natural. The patients react as if the protein were a germ, and their immune systems try to destroy it.
2002-07-23	AMGEN GAINS APPROVAL FOR WIDER USE OF ANEMIA DRUG	Amgen said yesterday that it had won federal approval to market its drug Aranesp for cancer patients who develop anemia after chemotherapy, putting it in direct competition with Johnson & Johnson's biggest seller, Procrit. Aranesp, intended to require fewer injections than Amgen's older therapy, Epogen, won initial approval in September for treating anemia stemming from chronic kidney disease. The two drugs provided a combined $2.2 billion in revenue last year for Amgen, the world's biggest biotechnology company. Studies have shown that Aranesp could be taken once every two weeks, while Procrit is taken once a week.
2002-07-20	U.S. Inquiry And Lawsuit Draw Reaction Of Drug Maker	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that accusations made by a former worker at a factory in Puerto Rico have ''no connection'' to a recent spate of illnesses in patients using the drug produced at that factory. It also said that the factory had been inspected twice in the last year by health authorities, who found only minor problems. The statements came a day after a report in The New York Times said that the Puerto Rico plant had become the subject of a federal criminal investigation. Shares of Johnson & Johnson plunged $7.88, or 16 percent, to $41.85.
2002-07-19	Drug Factory Of Johnson & Johnson Under Inquiry	The government is conducting a criminal investigation into a Johnson & Johnson factory that makes an anemia drug that has been linked to a spate of serious illnesses in Europe and Canada, according to court documents and people close to the situation. The factory, in Puerto Rico, manufactures Eprex, a drug that is used to increase the levels of red blood cells in people who are undergoing kidney dialysis or suffering from anemia caused by chemotherapy.
2002-07-17	JOHNSON & JOHNSON PROFIT RISES 12%	Johnson & Johnson's second-quarter profit rose 12 percent on increased sales of drugs to treat anemia and arthritis and devices used in heart procedures. Net income rose to $1.65 billion, or 54 cents a share, from $1.48 billion, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier, Johnson & Johnson said. Sales rose 11 percent, to $9.07 billion. Accelerating sales of medical devices, which account for a third of Johnson & Johnson's revenue, are helping the company weather a slowdown in pharmaceutical sales growth that has decreased profit at rivals focused mainly on drugs. Sales of medical tests and devices rose 14 percent, to $3.2 billion. Drug sales rose 10 percent, to $4.3 billion, a slowdown from 20 percent in the first quarter, as wholesalers reduced orders after stocking up ahead of a price increase.
2002-06-22	Panel Backs Relaxing Rules On P.&G. Drug For Heartburn	A Food and Drug Administration panel voted overwhelmingly yesterday to recommend allowing Procter & Gamble to sell the heartburn medicine Prilosec without a doctor's prescription. F.D.A. approval, which is expected later this year, will set the scene for a battle of marketing titans. Procter & Gamble, selling Prilosec, one of the world's most lucrative drugs, is under contract with AstraZeneca, which produces the drug. Together, they will challenge Pepcid, marketed by Johnson & Johnson, for leadership in the $1.6-billion-a-year market for over-the-counter heartburn treatments.
2002-06-19	P.&G. Wants Heartburn Drug to Be Nonprescription	Procter & Gamble will ask a Food and Drug Administration panel on Friday to allow one of the world's most lucrative drugs -- AstraZeneca's indigestion remedy Prilosec -- to be sold without a prescription. But it faces a fight. Industry experts say a nonprescription version of Prilosec, which Procter would market under a contract with AstraZeneca, would immediately challenge Pepcid AC, a heartburn treatment by Merck & Company that Johnson & Johnson began to offer over the counter in 1995.
2002-04-30	Net Rises 61% at King Pharmaceuticals	King Pharmaceuticals Inc. said today that its first-quarter profit rose 61 percent on sales of its Altace heart medicine and Levoxyl thyroid treatment. The company also agreed to buy a hormone therapy from Johnson & Johnson. Net income climbed to $71.3 million, or 29 cents a share, from $44.2 million, or 19 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 42 percent, to $258.1 million from $181.3 million.
2002-04-23	Panel Endorses Use of Claritin Over Counter For Some Hives	In a move that could reduce generic competition for the Schering-Plough Corporation's stable of allergy drugs, a federal advisory panel recommended yesterday that nonprescription Claritin be approved to treat the same allergies as the prescription version. If the Food and Drug Administration accepts the panel's recommendations, which it does most of the time, Claritin would be the first nonprescription treatment approved for chronic hives. For Schering-Plough, it would mean that rivals developing generic versions of the prescription drug would have to sell them over the counter at drugstore prices -- something that would translate into less profit.
2002-04-17	EARNINGS INCREASE 18% AT JOHNSON & JOHNSON	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that first-quarter profit rose 18 percent as sales increased for products ranging from drugs to treat anemia and arthritis to devices used in heart procedures. Net income was $1.83 billion, or 59 cents a share, up from $1.55 billion, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were up 11 percent, to $8.74 billion. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., has been building sales of higher-profit medical products, including the anemia medicine Procrit and stents, which are used to keep arteries open. Pharmaceutical sales rose 20 percent, to $4.18 billion, while sales of medical devices and diagnostics increased 8.2 percent, to $2.96 billion.
2002-04-10	7 Companies Join to Offer Discounts on Drugs to the Elderly	Seven large drug companies plan to announce today that they have joined to provide low-income elderly people with a card that they say will provide discounts of 20 percent or more on dozens of prescription medicines. Another drug maker, Merck & Company, said yesterday that it would be making it easier for low-income people of all ages to obtain its medicines free.
2002-03-29	Damages Set Aside in Patent Suit	Boston Scientific said today that a federal judge had set aside a damage award of $324.4 million that the company was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson in December 2000 for patent infringement. A judge in United States District Court in Wilmington, Del., upheld part of a jury verdict that found that one of Boston Scientific's stents had infringed on a patent owned by Johnson & Johnson, Boston Scientific said. A stent is a tiny mesh tube that props open arteries after they have been cleared by angioplasty.
2002-03-23	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO ACQUIRE BELGIAN DRUG MAKER	Johnson & Johnson, seeking to expand its line of infectious- disease treatments, agreed to buy a closely held Belgian drug maker, Tibotec- Virco, for about $320 million in cash and debt. Johnson & Johnson already markets Levaquin for pneumonia and bronchitis; Floxin for urinary tract infections; and an anemia drug, Procrit, to AIDS patients. It would gain two H.I.V. drug candidates in human trials. Tibotec-Virco, based in Mechelen, Belgium, is developing ''next generation'' versions of H.I.V. drugs for patients resistant to similar drugs on the market. The company also has operations in North Carolina and Ireland. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2002-02-24	Private Sector; From the Ranks, Unassumingly	BILL WELDON is the kind of guy who says he never really had his eye on the chairman's job at Johnson & Johnson, the global health care giant, and you almost believe him. But that is the job that will soon be handed to Mr. Weldon, a plain-speaking son of a Broadway stagehand and a seamstress, who has spent virtually his entire working life at the company. ''I'm one of those people who believe if you do what's right, things will work out,'' Mr. Weldon, now a vice chairman, said recently as he sat in his office in the Tower, as the company's 14-story hospital-white headquarters here is known.
2002-02-01	SCHERING FILES SUIT TO BLOCK GENERIC FORMS OF CLARITIN	Schering-Plough said yesterday that it had filed lawsuits to block two companies from selling generic versions of Claritin, its top-selling allergy drug.

2001-11-28	JOHNSON & JOHNSON UNIT WILL PAY $45 MILLION SETTLEMENT	The Lifescan unit of Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $45 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by consumers who said that meters used to test diabetics' blood-sugar levels were defective. More than 100,000 plaintiffs will receive refunds of about $300 each under the settlement. The agreement remains subject to the approval of Judge Jeremy Fogel of United States District Court in San Jose, Calif. The accord comes almost one year after LifeScan, of Milpitas, Calif., agreed to pay $60 million in civil and criminal penalties to the federal government after pleading guilty to failing to report known defects in the SureStep blood-glucose monitoring devices. This settlement ''in no way implies or acknowledges any wrongdoing by LifeScan,'' Johnson & Johnson said in a statement.
2001-11-21	F.D.A. CLEARS JOHNSON & JOHNSON BIRTH CONTROL PATCH	The drug maker Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a new birth-control patch slightly larger than a postage stamp. The patch, called Ortho Evra, can be used as an alternative to contraceptive pills. It will be sold by prescription in packs of one-month supplies. The patch is applied to the abdomen or buttocks each week for three weeks, and no patch is worn for the fourth. In studies, the patch was as successful in preventing pregnancy as oral contraceptives.
2001-10-26	JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONTACT LENS SETTLEMENT APPROVED	A New Jersey judge yesterday approved Johnson & Johnson's $860 million settlement of lawsuits that had accused the company of misleading consumers into prematurely throwing away disposable Acuvue contact lenses. The judge, John Fratto of New Jersey Superior Court, found that the settlement was a ''fair and reasonable'' resolution of lawsuits by consumers who said they were deceived into thinking they could use one-day Acuvue lenses only a single time, even though the product is identical to Acuvue lenses that may be worn as long as two weeks. Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay consumers as much as $840 million in cash, coupons and eye examinations. Consumers' lawyers will get $20 million under the settlement.
2001-10-26	Bayer Halves Price for Cipro, But Rivals Offer Drugs Free	When Bayer agreed on Wednesday to sell 100 million tablets of its anthrax medicine, Cipro, to the government for 95 cents apiece, Bayer and the Bush administration said the deal assured an ample supply at a very low price. But while Bayer nearly halved its previous price, three big pharmaceutical companies have since stepped forward to offer large quantities of their antibiotics free if the Food and Drug Administration will approve their use for the treatment of anthrax. Executives in the generic drug industry say Bayer is still at least breaking even and may even be making a large profit. And some infectious-disease experts warn that Bayer remains unable to supply enough Cipro if terrorists start releasing new strains of anthrax that are resistant to other antibiotics.
2001-10-25	4 Drug Makers Finally Outline Their Intentions	For weeks, most of the largest pharmaceutical companies have largely kept quiet as the nation prepared to battle anthrax, smallpox and other potential agents that could be used by terrorists. The big drug companies, which have dozens of factories and hundreds of scientists with expertise in infectious diseases, have said they are willing to help the government but they gave few details.
2001-10-25	Bayer Agrees to Charge Government a Lower Price for Anthrax Medicine	Federal health officials and executives of Bayer A.G. reached an agreement today that would nearly halve the price that Bayer charges the government for its anthrax medicine, Cipro. Bayer agreed to ship 100 million tablets of Cipro by the end of the year for 95 cents each, and to donate another 2 million tablets beginning next week. The government also obtained options to buy an additional 100 million tablets after this year at 85 cents each, and a further 100 million tablets for 75 cents apiece.
2001-09-30	Jury Levies $100 Million Award Against Heartburn Drug Maker	A Mississippi jury awarded $100 million in damages late Friday night to 10 people who said they had been injured by Propulsid, a heartburn drug that was taken from pharmacy shelves last year after it was linked to dozens of deaths. The manufacturer of the drug, Janssen Pharmaceutica, a division of Johnson & Johnson, said yesterday that it would ask the judge to overturn the verdict.
2001-09-08	JOHNSON TOLD TO PAY $8.3 MILLION IN PATENT CASE	A jury decided that Johnson & Johnson must pay a rival medical device maker, the Boston Scientific Corporation, $8.3 million, a fraction of the $226 million it sought, for infringing a patent on stents that prop open clogged blood vessels. After an 11-day trial, the federal jury in Wilmington, Del., concluded that Johnson & Johnson unintentionally breached one patent and did not infringe two others. Boston Scientific, which is based in Natick, Mass., had sought a finding of intentional infringement, which would have allowed Federal District Judge Sue Robinson to triple the damage award.
2001-08-24	AUSTRIAN DRUG COMPANY WINS APPROVAL FOR FACTORY	Sanochemia Pharmazeutika of Austria has won American regulatory approval for a factory that produces galantamine, a chemical used in Reminyl, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The company's shares rose 11 percent. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., and the Shire Pharmaceuticals Group of Britain already have Food and Drug Administration approval to sell Reminyl. Sanochemia is the exclusive supplier of galantamine. Reminyl may have peak annual revenue of $650 million, according to analyst estimates. Sanochemia, based in Vienna, has said Reminyl may be used to treat other diseases, lifting sales.
2001-08-22	GUIDANT SHARES RISE ON WORD OF WORK WITH STENTS	Shares of the Guidant Corporation, which makes medical devices, rose more than 11 percent yesterday after it said that it would work with Cook Inc. in an effort to bring to market a new stent -- a tube to prop open clogged arteries -- that is coated with drugs to stop the artery from becoming blocked again. Guidant said the deal would cut its schedule to bring a drug-coated stent to market by six months, which analysts said would narrow the lead of Johnson & Johnson to six to nine months. Guidant and Cook said on Monday that Guidant would become worldwide distributor of Cook's coronary stents. Shares of Guidant rose $3.40, to $35.
2001-07-28	JOHNSON & JOHNSON GIVES DETAILS OF SUIT PAYMENTS	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would award consumers cash and credits to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused it of misleading marketing of Acuvue contact lenses. The suit, filed in 1996, claimed that the eye products unit, Vistakon, misleadingly said a less-expensive one-day Acuvue lens should not be worn as long as a standard Acuvue lens, when in fact both lenses can be used for the same length of time. About six million people bought the lenses in the 1990's, court filings said. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., denied the accusations, and the settlement does not imply wrongdoing, the company said.
2001-07-15	A Company Credo, as Applied or Not	RALPH S. LARSEN, chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, clearly remembers his whereabouts on Tuesday, March 31, 1998. ''I was at a speaking engagement in Phoenix,'' he said. ''I got a phone call that said: 'Ralph, you're not going to believe this, but we just had a raid at our LifeScan headquarters by 30 or 40 armed federal agents. They've cordoned off the building and are serving a search warrant.' '' Mr. Larsen thought that the call might be an early April Fool's joke. ''It's no joke,'' the caller assured him.
2001-06-22	Biotech Drugs Show Promise as Psoriasis Treatments	New drugs made using biotechnology will soon offer what could be the first safe, long-term treatments for psoriasis, doctors at a conference devoted to the disease said yesterday. The new drugs ''are providing the first opportunity for safe and effective long-term management of this life-impacting disease,'' Dr. Alice Gottlieb, director of clinical research at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J., said at a news conference at the meeting, which is being held in San Francisco.
2001-06-12	Europeans Approve Amgen Anemia Drug	Amgen said today that it had received approval to sell a longer-lasting version of its anemia drug EPO in Europe, setting the stage for a fierce marketing battle with Johnson & Johnson, which now sells EPO there. Amgen's new drug, known as Aranesp, was approved by the European Commission to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney failure, whether or not they are on dialysis. Because it is longer lasting, Aranesp can be administered once a week or once every two weeks; EPO must be given as often as three times a week.
2001-05-24	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUY DIABETES UNIT FROM INVERNESS	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had agreed to buy most of Inverness Medical Technology for about $1.3 billion in stock as the company tries to regain leadership in the fast-growing diabetes-care market. Johnson & Johnson will pay $35 a share for Inverness's diabetes business, a 20 percent premium to Inverness's share price in the 20 days before May 9, when the companies said they were in acquisition talks. Johnson & Johnson will get control of the One Touch blood sugar monitors, which it already markets for Inverness.
2001-05-23	JOHNSON & JOHNSON COULD PAY $60 MILLION TO SETTLE SUIT	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had agreed to pay up to $60 million to settle claims by 32 states that accused contact lens makers of colluding to inflate their prices. The company will provide discounts of up to $100 for purchases of contact lenses and eye exams, said the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and pay $25 million to a settlement fund. Vistakon, a Johnson unit, denied it colluded or caused prices to exceed competitive levels. The company is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2001-05-11	JOHNSON & JOHNSON GETS APPROVAL FOR ALZA PURCHASE	Johnson & Johnson received early antitrust clearance for its planned $14 billion stock purchase of the Alza Corporation, the companies said yesterday. The 30-day antitrust waiting period was scheduled to expire next Monday, and the Federal Trade Commission said in a letter that it had no objections to the merger, said Jeffrey Leebaw, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson. The transaction is expected to be completed by early in the third quarter, the companies said in March. Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., agreed to pay 0.49 share for each share of Alza, which is based in California. Johnson & Johnson will gain the attention-deficit medicine Concerta which the companies now market together, and the purchase will add about $700 million to Johnson & Johnson's $12 billion in yearly sales of prescription drugs.
2001-04-18	Johnson & Johnson Settles Lawsuits Over Contact Lenses	Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay as much as $860 million to settle lawsuits accusing the company of misleading consumers into prematurely throwing away disposable Acuvue contact lenses. The suits contended that the company drove up sales of its 1-Day Acuvue soft lenses by advising consumers to use them just once, even though the product is identical to regular Acuvue lenses, which may be worn as long as two weeks.
2001-03-28	Corrections	A chart in Business Day yesterday comparing Johnson & Johnson with a company it plans to buy -- the Alza Corporation, a maker of alternative ways of delivering medicine to the body -- referred incorrectly to Procrit, a drug for anemia. It is made by Johnson & Johnson, not Alza.
2001-03-27	J.& J. Deal For Alza Is Seen Close	Johnson & Johnson is expected to announce today that it will acquire the Alza Corporation, a fast-growing concern that creates alternative ways to deliver medicine to the human body, for $11.8 billion in stock, executives close to the deal said. The transaction, which the boards of both companies approved late yesterday, is intended to bolster Johnson & Johnson's prescription drug business amid increased competition.
2001-03-11	CROSSROADS THEATER	Johnson & Johnson agreed last week to once again provide financing for Crossroads Theater, the struggling African-American theater that is trying to reopen its doors. The theater's board president, Rhinold Lamar Ponder, said Johnson & Johnson would cover some basic expenses that have gone unpaid in recent months, including $65,000 owed in rent to the New Brunswick Cultural Center, plus money estimated by Mr. Ponder at $30,000 to pay utility bills and turn on the phones, which were shut off when the theater suspended operations last September. Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, had previously contributed more than $100,000 annually to the theater. Jill P. Capuzzo
2001-03-03	JOHNSON & JOHNSON BUYS BABYCENTER FROM ETOYS	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it bought the BabyCenter Inc. Web site from eToys Inc. for $10 million. EToys had said on Monday that it planned to file for bankruptcy within the next five to 10 days. Etoys, an Internet retailer, said it would close down its eToys.com Web site about March 8 and intended to sell its assets, including the three-year-old BabyCenter. Johnson & Johnson already operates a number of sites for parents of young children, including Yourbaby.com. BabyCenter has won awards for its Web site and services, Johnson & Johnson and eToys said.
2001-02-14	JOHNSON & JOHNSON NAMES 2 TO NEW VICE CHAIRMAN POSTS	Johnson & Johnson named two top executives to newly created positions of vice chairmen yesterday, a move seen as preparing for new leadership at the company, one of the world's top makers of medical devices and drugs. James Lenehan, head of the medical device and diagnostics business, and William Weldon, who leads the pharmaceuticals business, will become part of the office of the chairman, joining Johnson & Johnson's chief executive, Ralph Larsen, 62, and its senior vice chairman, Robert Wilson, 60. Johnson & Johnson declined to comment on the reasons for the appointment.
2001-02-11	Questions Linger For Crossroads	The Crossroads Theater Company bought some time last week, but two crucial questions remain: Did it buy enough time? Did it get enough money? While members of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts and the theater's president spoke optimistically about the latest infusion of hope, the reality was harsher.
2001-01-24	2 Drug Companies Post Solid Quarterly Results	Merck and Johnson & Johnson posted robust fourth-quarter results yesterday, indicating that sales of prescription drugs remain strong even as the economy cools. Merck, the nation's second-largest drug company behind Pfizer, reported a 12 percent increase in profits on rising sales of drugs like Vioxx, a pain reliever; Zocor, a cholesterol treatment; and Singulair, an asthma controller.
2000-12-16	Guilty Plea By Division Of Drug Giant	LifeScan, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, pleaded guilty to criminal charges yesterday and agreed to pay $60 million in fines for selling defective blood glucose monitoring devices to diabetics and submitting false information about the problems to federal regulators. According to the plea agreement, Life-Scan's SureStep blood glucose monitoring system, which was sold between May 1996 and late 1997, had two defects that caused the device to register inaccurate readings. Sometimes, when a patient had a dangerously high glucose level, the device would display an error message instead of a ''HI'' warning. Lawyers who have filed a class-action lawsuit against LifeScan say that at least three diabetics may have died as a result of the faulty readings on the SureStep devices.
2000-12-16	BOSTON SCIENTIFIC TO PAY $324.4 MILLION IN PATENT CASE	The Boston Scientific Corporation must pay the Cordis unit of Johnson & Johnson $324.4 million in damages for infringing a patent, a jury decided. The patent concerned stents, surgical devices used to hold formerly clogged blood vessels open after heart surgery, and the jury said it based the damages on royalties and profits forgone by Cordis because Boston Scientific sold a competing stent. The figure was about two-thirds what Cordis had asked in the suit.
2000-12-07	Film Halted After Advertiser Objects	The USA cable network abruptly canceled production of a television movie that was to be based on two 1986 deaths caused by Excedrin laced with cyanide after the network received complaints from Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson, a major advertiser on USA, said yesterday that it had expressed concerns about the film to network executives, but it denied undertaking any further intervention.
2000-11-22	MEDTRONIC UNIT INFRINGED PATENT ON STENTS, JURY SAYS	Medtronic AVE Inc., a unit of the No. 1 pacemaker manufacturer Medtronic Inc., was found by a federal jury in Delaware to have infringed patents held by the Cordis Corporation unit of Johnson & Johnson for devices known as expandable stents that are used to hold unclogged blood vessels open. Cordis sued AVE, then Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc., in 1997, asserting that the unit had misappropriated technology that Cordis had patented in 1988 and 1993. Johnson & Johnson, acquired Cordis in 1996; Medtronic, based in Natick, Mass., acquired AVE in 1998. A companion suit by Cordis against the Boston Scientific Corporation over stent patents began in the same court after the Cordis-Medtronic verdict was announced. Stent sales last year totaled $2.2 billion.
2000-09-20	Hold the Ads, ABC Decides	The world of network television is increasingly about creating events, and ABC, with its plan for ''Gideon's Crossing,'' a medical drama, has found a way to make one of its new shows stand out.

2000-08-02	JOHNSON & JOHNSON ALZHEIMER'S DRUG NEARS APPROVAL	Johnson & Johnson's treatment for Alzheimer's disease, Reminyl, is close to Food and Drug Administration approval, the agency said, bringing the company a step nearer to selling the drug in the United States. Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had received a so-called approvable letter from the F.D.A. The letters spell out final issues to be resolved before the agency will allow a drug to be marketed; such issues often involve product labeling. A study financed by Johnson & Johnson found that the drug, which has the chemical name of galantamine hydrobromide, improves all three types of disabilities that Alzheimer's patients commonly suffer.
2000-07-18	Tylenol to Become Available To Japanese Market This Fall	In a sign that American drug companies are cracking open the Japanese market, Johnson & Johnson will announce today that Tylenol will be available in Japan early this fall. Japan is the second largest market for over-the-counter drugs in the world. But for decades, the government has kept many foreign drug makers out. And, many drugs available to Europeans or Americans are not approved for sale in Japan.
2000-04-22	JOHNSON & JOHNSON SELLS CANADIAN CONDOM BUSINESS	Johnson & Johnson agreed yesterday to sell its Canadian business that makes Shields condoms to Pacific Dunlop's United States.-based unit for an undisclosed amount. Pacific Dunlop's Ansell Healthcare Products, a maker of LifeStyles brand condoms, said the addition of the Shields brand would give it 20 percent of the condom market in Canada. Pacific Dunlop, which makes products from batteries to condoms, is based in Melbourne, Australia. Ansell is based in Red Bank, N.J. Johnson & Johnson is based in New Brunswick, N.J.
2000-03-30	Online Exchange for Health Care Companies Could Cut Costs	Five big health care companies, which account for about 70 percent of the equipment, drugs and other supplies bought by the nation's hospitals, said yesterday that they planned to form an online exchange that would provide information about products and enable customers to place and track orders. The companies -- Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic Inc. and GE Medical Systems, a unit of the General Electric Company -- say the exchange's purpose is to cut hundreds of millions of dollars out of the costs that they and their customers incur while handling the drudge work of processing orders. Although customers would continue to negotiate prices with individual manufacturers, they would use the exchange to place orders under previously negotiated contracts, check on the status of orders, arrange delivery, check supporting documentation and learn more about products.
2000-03-05	Corrections	An article on Feb. 13 about corporate mission statements omitted several words in an excerpt from part of Johnson & Johnson's. The passage should have read, ''Our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services.''
1999-12-24	Dolan Leads Bidding for Jets	In the race to buy the Jets, Charles F. Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, is in the lead, followed closely by Robert Wood Johnson IV, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, according to several persons with knowledge of the negotiations. Although the team is expected to sell for about $600 million, Dolan is not believed to have reached that level yet. The sale is being negotiated by Goldman, Sachs, which has spent the last 16 days analyzing ''final'' bids submitted by the bidders, including Sam Grossman, a Phoenix real-estate developer, and trying to negotiate them higher.
1999-12-12	A Medicine Chest or a Grocery Shelf?	AMERICANS, who have always looked at supermarkets as cornucopias of calories, are increasingly finding fare of a different kind in the grocery aisles. Stacked in the rows of margarines, breakfast cereals, salad dressings and snacks are elixirs that promise to fight heart disease, osteoporosis and other ailments. And in some cases, the products are billed as alternatives to medicine. Concerned about cholesterol? McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson & Johnson, recently introduced a margarine that contains an ingredient shown to lower it by about 10 percent with two weeks of use.
1999-12-10	Unlikely Allies With the United Nations; For Big Companies, a Strategic Partnership Opens Doors in Developing Countries	When Amoco started drilling for oil in Angola a few years ago, Exxon and Chevron had already landed some of the richest oil fields and could easily outbid their smaller rival for others. Lately, though, Amoco has been the successful bidder on several oil tracts. Why? The company, which is now BP Amoco, realized that the Angolan government, torn by civil war, was ready to favor any company that was also willing to assist with social projects. So in 1997 Amoco offered to spend $800,000 to help local fishermen revive an abandoned fishing port -- and asked the local office of the United Nations Development Program to manage the project.
1999-12-10	Arterial-Device Patent Suit	A unit of Medtronic Inc., the leading global provider of pacemakers, has accused the Cordis Corporation unit of Johnson & Johnson of infringing on a patent. In the suit, filed in federal court, Medtronic AVE, formerly Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc., stated that it owned a patent issued a year ago for placing stents -- used to hold open arteries -- with a tiny balloon at the end of a wire. Medtronic, which acquired AVE in January, contends that Cordis, which is based in Miami Lakes, Fla., is making and using the invention without Medtronic's permission.

1999-11-11	F.D.A. Approves Arthritis Drug	Johnson & Johnson won approval to market its drug Remicade as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, clearing it to compete with Enbrel, a drug sold by the Immunex Corporation and its parent, the American Home Products Corporation. The Food and Drug Administration cleared Remicade, already being sold to treat the digestive disorder Crohn's disease, for the new use in treating rheumatoid arthritis, a debilitating disease that attacks the joints. The drug will be available immediately for the expanded use, Johnson & Johnson said.
1999-11-10	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUY INNOVASIVE DEVICES	Johnson & Johnson, the health care products giant, has agreed to acquire Innovasive Devices Inc. for $85 million in stock.

In the transaction, Innovasive Devices stockholders will exchange each of their shares for Johnson & Johnson stock worth $8.25, the companies said late on Monday. Shares of Innovasive Devices changed hands at $7.9375, down 53.125 cents.
1999-10-20	Big Drug Makers Register Strong Gains in Quarter	If the world's largest pharmaceutical companies were to choose a theme to accompany this week's third-quarter earnings announcements, it might be ''Let the Good Times Roll.'' Pfizer, maker of the impotence pill Viagra, surprised analysts yesterday by announcing a 36 percent increase in third-quarter operating income, to $906 million. The company said it earned 23 cents a diluted share, excluding charges, which is 2 cents above the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/ Thomson Financial.
1999-08-24	An Old-Fashioned Brawl Among Options Exchanges	Facing new challenges from electronic trading systems and regulatory inquiries into anticompetitive practices, the nation's leading options exchanges opted today for an old-fashioned market brawl.

1999-07-22	Johnson & Johnson to Acquire Centocor	Out to strengthen its pipeline of new drugs, Johnson & Johnson announced yesterday that it would buy Centocor Inc., one of the nation's largest biotechnology companies, for $4.9 billion in stock.

1999-07-21	Drug Makers Reporting Mixed Results During Second Quarter	The world's largest pharmaceutical companies are expected to notch some healthy gains in second-quarter earnings this week, but analysts are not convinced that will be enough to rouse investor interest. Johnson & Johnson, long dismissed as an industry laggard, surprised analysts yesterday by announcing a 14.9 percent increase in its second-quarter earnings, to $1.16 billion. The company, which makes such disparate brands as Tylenol, Neutrogena and the anemia drug Procrit, said it had earned 84 cents a diluted share, 2 cents above the First Call Corporation's consensus estimate.
1999-06-22	Coca-Cola Chairman Uses Ads to Apologize to Belgians	The chairman of the Coca-Cola Company apologized to the people of Belgium in extraordinarily contrite newspaper ads today over a contamination scare that began there more than a week ago and spread to other countries in Europe. But he stopped short of conceding that Coca-Cola products made anyone sick, and a study released by the company suggested something else had caused their symptoms. ''To those people who suffered, especially the children, my colleagues and I want to express a very sincere apology,'' the chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, said in the ads, printed in Flemish and French. ''We strive to make sure that Coca-Cola always stands for good feelings, and we regret that it instead resulted in feelings of illness.''
1999-06-14	Media Talk; Commercial Puts Reporter in Tight Spot	It's not real news, but it looks and tastes just like real news! In a national commercial that began showing over Memorial Day weekend, Mary Civiello, a reporter for WCBS-TV news in New York City and, until recently, an alternate anchor on CNBC, stands in a grocery store, suited up and coiffed as if for a television broadcast. A microphone appears in front of a man, then a woman, who declare their approval of Benecol, a Johnson & Johnson margarine product that the company says helps to lower cholesterol levels.
1999-04-21	Strong Earnings Lift Pharmaceutical Stocks	A steep weeklong selloff in pharmaceutical stocks halted yesterday, after three large drug makers reported strong first-quarter earnings and Merck & Company received a recommendation from a Government panel that its new drug for arthritis and acute pain be approved.

SmithKline Beecham P.L.C's first-quarter profit increased 14 percent, to $540 million, or 48.9 cents an American depository receipt, which surpassed expectations.
1998-12-19	Amgen Wins One Against Johnson & Johnson	Amgen Inc., the world's leading biotechnology company, won all rights to a once-a-week version of its $3 billion anemia drug in an arbitration battle with Johnson & Johnson, the companies said today. Johnson & Johnson, the world's No. 5 drug maker, had sought rights to sell the new version of recombinant human erythropoietin, or EPO. A 1985 licensing agreement with Amgen created the basis for the battle by dividing the market for EPO, now the world's best-selling bioengineered drug.
1998-12-18	JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS BUYING A RIVAL'S SKIN CARE BUSINESS	Johnson & Johnson, the health care products giant, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the skin care business of S. C. Johnson & Son Inc. Terms were not disclosed. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., sells products like Neutrogena face wash and shampoo. It is looking for a bigger share of the $47 billion global skin care market. The dermatological brands of S. C. Johnson, a closely held company based in Racine, Wis., include the Aveeno oatmeal skin-care line, Pentrax dandruff shampoo and Rhuli anti-ich cream. It also makes household cleaning, home storage and insect-control products. Johnson & Johnson's stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $80.
1998-12-08	JOHNSON & JOHNSON ENDS COLLABORATION WITH ERGO	Johnson & Johnson has terminated its collaboration agreement with the Ergo Science Corporation on products to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity, Ergo said yesterday. Ergo, a biopharmaceutical company based in Charlestown, Mass., said it was disappointed with the decision and would re-evaluate its strategies on the products. In November, the Food and Drug Administration rejected Ergo's new drug application for its Ergoset product for Type 2 diabetes, also called adult-onset diabetes, but is considering an appeal. Ergo had 1997 revenues of $1.7 million. Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical and health care products giant, had 1997 revenues of $22.63 billion.
1998-12-04	Drug Maker To Close Plants And Cut Jobs	In a move to bolster lagging earnings, Johnson & Johnson, the world's fifth-largest drug maker, announced yesterday that it would take an $800 million charge in the fourth quarter in part to close 36 plants and cut 4,100 jobs, about 4 percent of its global work force. Eleven of the plants are in the United States. The cuts come as Johnson & Johnson, one of the most diversified companies in the pharmaceutical industry, struggles to keep pace with its competitors. In the third quarter, the company posted an 11 percent increase in earnings, one of the worst performances in the industry, while most of its competitors had gains of some 16 percent.
1998-12-02	Lawsuit Against Drug Makers Is Dismissed	After more than nine weeks of testimony, a Federal judge here dismissed a class-action lawsuit that accused four major drug makers of conspiring to fix prices. Saying that evidence of a conspiracy was ''meager'' to ''nonexistent,'' United States District Judge Charles P. Kocoras threw out the case against Johnson & Johnson, Novartis A.G., the Monsanto Company and Forest Laboratories, and a group of drug wholesalers.
1998-11-26	Johnson Shares Fall on Lower '99 Estimate	Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest maker of medical devices, said yesterday that its 1999 profit would be less than the $3 a share estimated earlier, sending shares down 3 percent. Johnson & Johnson's shares fell $2.625 to close at $82.625. The company, which is based in New Brunswick, reached a record high of $89 just last Friday. For the last year, Johnson & Johnson has improved quarterly profit 10 percent or more by keeping a tight rein on its expenses amid sluggish growth in sales. Now, opportunities for cost-cutting are running out, while the company has suffered several setbacks with products it was counting on to pump up sales.
1998-11-22	Ideas & Trends: No Deus Ex Machina; First Read the Directions, Then Do No Harm	WITH thousands of new tools and techniques introduced into medicine each year, doctors face constant pressure to stay abreast of technology. And savvy patients shop around for those who will perform the latest procedures advertised in newspapers or discussed at dinner parties. But what most patients don't know as they're wheeled into the operating room is how skilled their doctors are with the new equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first time, may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative. Or they may lack any training, which was the case last year when two doctors at New York's Beth Israel Medical Center operated on a 30-year-old woman to remove fibroid tumors from her uterus. The woman, Lisa Smart, died of cardiac arrest. Last week her husband, Anderson, asked that criminal charges be filed against her doctors, Robert Klinger and Marc Sklar, and David Myers, a salesman for Johnson & Johnson, which manufactured the equipment involved. A New York State Health Department report said that Mr. Myers operated the equipment, and the New York State Education Department, which licenses doctors, found evidence that his activities amounted to practicing medicine without a license. The Education Department has recommended that Mr. Myers be prosecuted.
1998-11-17	Husband Wants Doctors and Salesman Charged in Fatal Surgery	Lawyers for a New York City police officer whose wife died after a botched surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center last November called on the State Attorney General and the Manhattan District Attorney yesterday to file criminal charges against two doctors and a salesman for a medical supply company involved in the procedure. Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said prosecutors would review a report by the State Department of Health issued earlier this month that said the surgery violated a host of medical standards. If evidence of criminal wrongdoing is found, she said, prosecutors will begin their own investigation. The Attorney General's office did not respond to calls requesting comment.
1998-11-15	Take Two Stocks and Call Me in the Morning	IT should come as no surprise that investors out to shield themselves from the recent market volatility would dive into the stocks of drug makers. After all, people get sick regardless of market conditions. But what no one could have predicted was that some investors would pass up such comet stocks as Warner-Lambert, up 76.5 percent this year, and Schering-Plough, up 64 percent, for the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb. But that's what they have been doing.
1998-11-11	The Elixirs Of Life Style; Drugs Can Spark Sex Lives and Grow Hair, So Why Are Some Sales Listless?	Ben Boucher looked in the mirror several months ago and decided that he did not want to be bald like his father. So, like millions of other balding men, Mr. Boucher, a 25-year-old animator in Montreal who is a long way from losing his hair, picked up a prescription for Propecia, Merck & Company's hair growth pill, and awaited the results. ''I can't say that I've actually grown more hair,'' said Mr. Boucher, who has plenty of long hair but has lost some around the edges. ''But Propecia has stopped my hair from falling out. And I'm happy for that.''
1998-11-10	Hospital Accused of Hiding Details of Woman's Death	The husband of a woman who died during a routine surgical procedure at Beth Israel Medical Center last year charged yesterday that the hospital tried to keep the circumstances of her death from both state regulators and family members. He also contended that members of his wife's family repeatedly asked for explanations that never came. The charges came during a news conference yesterday in front of the New York State Supreme Court, minutes after lawyers for the husband, Anderson Smart, filed a lawsuit against the hospital, the doctors who performed the procedure and the company that made the equipment used during surgery.
1998-11-09	Blaming Beth Israel Hospital and Doctors in Woman's Death, Family Says It Will Sue	The family of a woman who died after routine outpatient surgery last year at Beth Israel Medical Center is suing the hospital, three physicians and a medical supply company, for medical malpractice and negligence, the family's lawyer said last night. The suit, which calls for punitive and compensatory damages but does not name an amount, will be filed today in New York State Supreme Court, the lawyer said. The suit caps a year during which the dead woman's family lived with suspicion but no proof that the hospital and doctors had been negligent in their care, the lawyer said. She added that the family had been stymied by Beth Israel's reluctance to discuss the case with them.
1998-11-06	Fatal Surgery Leads to Fine For Hospital	One day last November, a 30-year-old woman went to Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan for a routine outpatient procedure -- the removal of a benign fibroid tumor in her uterus, a procedure performed 237,000 times a year in hospitals throughout the country. By the end of the day, she was dead. Yesterday, state health officials said her death was the result of a few hours of egregious care in which more than a dozen medical standards were violated.
1998-09-22	Drug Price-Fixing Suit Goes Before Jury	Lawyers for thousands of United States pharmacists go before a jury this week with their price-fixing lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, Novartis A.G., Forest Laboratories, the Monsanto Corporation's G. D. Searle unit and the nation's largest drug wholesalers. Open arguments are set to begin on Wednesday and Thursday in Chicago in the trial, which involves companies that declined to join a settlement of the case challenging the drug industry's practice of offering discounts to its largest customers. A jury was selected last week.
1998-09-07	Big Marketers Join to Upgrade Internet Ads	Seven top marketers are joining the At Home Corporation, which operates the At Home Network Internet service, to create and test the larger, more elaborate types of on-line advertising that were the subject of a meeting last month on interactive marketing sponsored by the Procter & Gamble Company. Susan Bratton, advertising director for the At Home Network in Redwood City, Calif., identified the marketers as the AT&T Corporation, the Bank of America unit of the BankAmerica Corporation, First USA, the Intel Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Levi Strauss & Company and Toys ''R'' Us.
1998-07-24	World News Briefs; Russian Tax Problem For Johnson & Johnson	Tax authorities say that a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, the world's fifth-largest drug maker, owes them almost $19 million in back taxes and that they have begun criminal cases against two of the company's managers here. A spokesman for the Moscow department of the Federal Tax Police, Oleg Mikhailov, said on Wednesday that the company owed $18.9 million in taxes for 1994, 1995 and nine months of 1996.
1998-07-22	Johnson & Johnson to Buy Medical Device Maker	Johnson & Johnson, the big diversified health care manufacturer, agreed yesterday to buy DePuy Inc., a successful maker of orthopedic devices, for $3.5 billion in cash. After the purchase, Johnson & Johnson would be one of the largest makers of artificial joints and other devices that replace or strengthen body parts. Analysts said Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., was seeking to regain momentum after disappointing losses of market share in sales of another type of medical device, coronary stents, which prop open clogged arteries. DePuy makes hip and knee replacements and titanium mesh implants that are used increasingly often in lower back operations.
1998-07-18	JOHNSON & JOHNSON CUTTING JOBS FROM DIAGNOSTIC UNIT	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would eliminate 400 jobs to cut costs in its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics unit, which makes tests to screen for high cholesterol, H.I.V. infections and other medical conditions. Johnson & Johnson, maker of Band-Aids and the painkiller Tylenol, said it would offer incentives to employees with at least 12 years of service, or about half of the unit's 2,400 workers, to leave voluntarily. Johnson & Johnson, the world's fifth-largest drug maker, is relying more on its pharmaceutical business for profit growth as medical device sales drop, analysts say. Insurers and governments are paying less for medical tests. In response, Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., said it would cut more jobs and dismiss more employees if necessary.
1998-04-15	2 Drug Companies Report Big Quarterly Profit Gains	Pfizer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, two of the nation's biggest pharmaceutical companies, reported double-digit percentage gains in first-quarter earnings yesterday on the strength of some of their top-selling drugs. Pfizer, based in New York, said earnings totaled $692 million, or 53 cents a diluted share, up 15 percent from $602 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $3.34 billion, up 11 percent from $3 billion.
1998-04-09	Johnson & Johnson Realigns TV Buying	Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, N.J., has consolidated responsibilities for national television buying by naming McCann-Erickson New York as agency of record for network, cable and syndicated TV. Johnson & Johnson spends an estimated $568 million annually on national TV ads.
1998-03-04	AMYLIN PHARMACEUTICALS SHARES OFF 44% ON FAILED DEAL	Shares of Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. lost almost half their value yesterday after the company announced late on Monday that Johnson & Johnson was withdrawing from a collaborative agreement to develop a new diabetes drug, Pramlintide. Amylin, a biotechnology company based in San Diego, also reported yesterday a fourth-quarter loss that was greater than Wall Street expectations. The company plans to reduce its work force by about 25 percent to insure that it has sufficient cash to operate for another year. Shares of the company fell $2.25, or 44 percent, to $2.8125, in Nasdaq trading of almost 3.1 million shares.
1998-02-27	New Ranking On Drug Sales In U.S. in '97	Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical industry's quiet giant, has replaced Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. as the top drug seller in the United States, an annual survey of pharmaceutical sales showed yesterday. Glaxo, which ended its merger discussions with its British rival SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. on Monday, tumbled to fourth place for 1997, severely hurt by the patent expiration on Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcerant drug. Sales of Zantac, the best-selling drug in the nation in 1996, plunged 37 percent, to $1.097 billion, according to I.M.S. America, a health care information company that did the survey.
1998-01-21	Profits Are Up at Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that its earnings grew more than 13 percent in the fourth quarter as rising drug sales made up for a decline in sales of a key medical device. Net income at the company, which makes Band-Aids, Tylenol and other health care products, rose to $630 million, or 45 cents a diluted share, from $556 million, or 41 cents, in the comparable period a year earlier.
1997-12-23	F.D.A. Approves Johnson's Stent	Johnson & Johnson received Food and Drug Administration approval yesterday for an improved version of its stent, as competition intensifies in the market for devices used to prop open heart arteries. The Palmaz-Schatz Crown stent comes mounted on a high-pressure balloon catheter that expands to clear the fatty buildup in the arteries. Stents are used to prevent the arteries from narrowing after balloon angioplasty, allowing blood to continue flowing freely.
1997-10-23	Advertisers are shuffling accounts that add up to more than $210 million in billings.	SEVERAL big national advertisers made changes on their accounts this week involving billings estimated at more than $210 million. One of the largest was the Vistakon unit of Johnson & Johnson, which named McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York to handle its worldwide Acuvue contact lenses account, with billings estimated at $40 million to $50 million. The account had been handled for the last decade by Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York, which like McCann is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
1997-08-29	Appeals Court Reinstates Drug Companies in Lawsuit	A Federal appeals court has reinstated a pharmaceutical joint venture and five drug wholesalers in a class-action lawsuit filed by thousands of the nation's pharmacists, who accused the companies of conspiring to fix prices. The decision sharply increases the potential liability faced by the joint venture, the DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Company, and eight other drug manufacturers that remain as defendants in the case.
1997-08-05	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUY GYNECARE FOR $79 MILLION	Johnson & Johnson agreed yesterday to buy Gynecare Inc. for stock valued at about $79 million, or $8.46 a share, entering the market for products to treat uterine disorders. The maker of medical devices, drugs and consumer-health products said buying Gynecare, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., would expand its line of women's health products. Shares of Gynecare fell 37.5 cents, to $8.125. Gynecare, which develops devices to treat uterine bleeding, will become part of Johnson's Ethicon Inc. division, which sells wound-closing and other surgical products. Johnson & Johnson's stock fell 12.50 cents, to $60.9375.
1997-07-21	Motrin Account To Cordiant Unit	The McNeil Consumer Products unit of Johnson & Johnson has named Saatchi & Saatchi Health Care Connection in New York to handle its recently acquired Motrin brand of pain reliever. Billings, which had been estimated at $15 million to $20 million, are expected to be increased to $25 million to $30 million.
1997-07-16	Pfizer Net Up, but Below Expectations	Pfizer Inc. posted an earnings gain yesterday that fell slightly short of expectations, while another drug manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, reported a result that met analysts' forecasts. Pfizer said earnings rose 16 percent as expenses increased more than sales. Net income grew to $457 million, or 35 cents a share, from $394 million, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split on June 30. Analysts had expected, on average, a per-share result of 36 cents.
1997-07-03	F.D.A. Warnings Preceded Withdrawal of H.I.V. Test	In the months before a Johnson & Johnson unit removed a controversial home H.I.V. test from the market, Federal regulators issued stern directives to the company to clean up its quality control procedures, Government records show. The company's Direct Access Diagnostics unit said last Thursday that it was withdrawing the test, called Confide, as a result of weak sales. But the formal warnings from the Food and Drug Administration may have been the last straw for a product that Johnson & Johnson fought 10 years with the agency for the right to sell and spent millions of dollars to develop.
1997-04-16	Newer Drugs Increase Sales Of 2 Makers	Both Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc. reported first-quarter earnings gains of more than 10 percent yesterday, paced by strong sales of their newer medications. Johnson & Johnson, which makes Band-Aids and the painkiller Tylenol, said earnings climbed 15.1 percent, led by sales of its schizophrenia drug Risperdal and its anti-anemia drug Procrit.
1997-04-10	COMPANY BRIEFS	UROMED CORP., Needham, Mass., which makes products for urological and gynecological disorders, bought the rights to an incontinence device from Johnson & Johnson Medical Inc., for undisclosed terms.
1997-03-18	Johnson Settles H.I.V.-Test Suit	Johnson & Johnson said today that it had settled a dispute in an agreement that lets it keep control of its H.I.V. home-testing business. In October, a judge upheld an arbitrator's ruling that Johnson & Johnson return the then-unprofitable Confide H.I.V. testing business to a former executive, Elliott Millenson, who had founded it. The unit offers people a way to test themselves for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, at home.
1997-03-14	Dow 8,000? Almost, With 4 New Stocks	Would you believe an 8,000 Dow Jones industrial average? Had Dow Jones made the changes announced this week back in 1991, the last time the bellwether index was adjusted, this week would have seen the Dow come perilously close to that level. Dow Jones & Company announced on Wednesday that it was adding four stocks to the Dow index, and removing four others. As has often been the case, it added some of America's most eminent, and successful, companies, while taking out some that had not done well in the market.
1997-03-13	Dow Average to Replace 4 Stocks To Better Reflect the U.S. Economy	Dow Jones & Company announced yesterday that it would replace 4 of the 30 stocks in the closely watched Dow Jones industrial average -- the first change in the index in nearly six years. The company said the moves -- to be effective Monday -- reflected the growing role of technology, health care and financial services in the economy, but the changes clearly represented an effort, as well, to get rid of some losers in the index.
1997-02-12	JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO BUY LENS EQUIPMENT MAKER	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would buy Innotech Inc., which manufactures equipment used to make eyeglass lenses, for $13.75 a share, or $123.8 million. Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., is the world's biggest maker of contact lenses. Optometrists use Innotech's products to manufacture difficult-to-make prescription eyeglasses, like bifocals, on site. The lens equipment costs a typical optometrist about $14,000. Shares of Innotech, which is based in Roanoke, Va., rose $4.64, or 52 percent, to $13.5156. Johnson & Johnson's shares climbed 37.5 cents, to $60.
1996-12-24	U.S. Clearance for Drug	Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, said today that the Food and Drug Administration had cleared its antibiotic Floxin tablets as a sole treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease. Ortho-McNeil said pelvic inflammatory disease affects one million women a year and can lead to serious complications, including infertility. Previous treatment combined injections or intravenous medication and oral antibiotics.
1996-12-04	Cadwell Davis Loses Three J.& J. Brands	The personal products division of Johnson & Johnson has moved the North American accounts of three feminine-hygiene brands from Cadwell Davis Partners in New York to two other Johnson & Johnson roster agencies. Combined billings were estimated at $28 million to $30 million. Jeffrey Leebaw, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, N.J., confirmed reports of the changes this week in Advertising Age and Adweek. The decision came without a review, Mr. Leebaw said.
1996-11-22	BUYOUT SPECULATION PUSHES BAUSCH & LOMB STOCK HIGHER	Bausch & Lomb Inc.'s stock rallied yesterday amid speculation that the company could be the target of a $48-a-share bid from Johnson & Johnson. Officers were not available for comment at either company. The speculation about a deal was advanced by an article in Financial World magazine quoting Philip Foreman, a money manager at Composite Research and Management, as saying that Johnson & Johnson could be a buyer of Bausch, a maker of contact lenses and sunglasses. The shares of Bausch & Lomb, which is based in Rochester, were up $2.25, to $35.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, where 2.5 million of its shares were traded. Johnson & Johnson shares were up 75 cents, to $52.125, also on the Big Board. Johnson & Johnson is the market leader in the contact lens market, while Bausch & Lomb is No. 2.
1996-11-21	Sales of Home H.I.V. Tests Are Brisk, But Concern Persists Over Propriety	At a Rite Aid drugstore in Manhattan recently, a man handed the pharmacist a slip of paper he had torn from a pad hanging next to the condoms. After the pharmacy section cleared out, she gave him a bag with a home H.I.V. test inside. ''I wouldn't do it with all these people in there,'' said the pharmacist, Linda Lee. Many customers, she realizes, do not want to be seen taking kits off the counter, where they are displayed between nicotine patches and reading glasses.
1996-10-17	DEVELOPER OF DIABETES DRUG PLANS TO SELL STAKES	Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. said yesterday that it would sell up to $15 million in stock, or about 1.2 million common shares, to Johnson & Johnson. Amylin said it had also filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of 1.5 million shares. Proceeds from the sales will be used to finance Amylin's clinical trials of an experimental diabetes drug, pramlintide, which is supposed to improve glucose control in patients using insulin. Johnson & Johnson has teamed with Amylin to develop the drug. After both stock sales are completed, Johnson & Johnson will hold about 10.2 percent of the 30.9 million shares Amylin is expected to have outstanding.
1996-10-17	The big drug makers continue to ride a wave of rising sales.	PHARMACEUTICAL stocks are on a roll for a third consecutive year, propelled by relatively new products and a renewed ability to raise prices and generally outfox the managed care industry. Several of the strongest drug makers have posted robust third-quarter results, pleasing investors with per-share earnings a penny or two more than most analyst expectations. Merck & Company, the Schering-Plough Corporation and Johnson & Johnson, the diversified health care giant, each reported double-digit percentage growth in after-tax profits yesterday, as had Pfizer Inc. on Tuesday.
1996-10-10	Johnson Buys Company	Johnson & Johnson has bought Indigo Medical Inc., a maker of portable laser surgery systems, for an undisclosed price. The closely held Indigo makes low-cost lasers that are approved in the United States to treat urological conditions. In Europe, the company also sells lasers for treating enlarged prostates. Indigo, based in Palo Alto, Calif., was formed in May 1990 with the help of Johnson & Johnson's development corporation, which invests in start-up companies.
1996-08-20	Marriage of Necessity: Nonprofit Groups and Drug Makers	In the latest marketing marriage of a drug maker and a nonprofit health care association, SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. of Britain will pay $1 million a year to the American Cancer Society and put the society's name on SmithKline's Nicoderm smoking-cessation patches, which can be purchased without a prescription. With the deal, SmithKline stole a march on Johnson & Johnson, which recently introduced its own nonprescription nicotine skin patch, Nicotrol, as well as an over-the-counter version of Nicorette chewing gum to help smokers quit. The Johnson & Johnson products do not have a tie-in with a disease-prevention group like the SmithKline deal, which was announced last week.
1996-07-30	Johnson & Johnson Fights to Retain Its H.I.V. Test Unit	"Johnson & Johnson filed suit today, seeking to overturn an arbitrator's ruling that it must hand control of its H.I.V. home-testing business back to an executive whom the arbitrator said the company had wrongfully dismissed. On Friday, John J. Gibbons, the arbitrator, ordered Johnson & Johnson to give the former executive, Elliott Millenson, ""all assets necessary"" to put him in operating control of the business he founded for home-testing of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The order was reported in The Wall Street Journal today."
1996-07-17	ARBITRATOR RULES J.& J WRONGFULLY FIRED AN EXECUTIVE	An arbitrator ruled yesterday that a former Johnson & Johnson executive who had sought the return of an H.I.V.-testing company that he sold to J.& J. in 1993 was wrongfully terminated as president and chief executive of the Direct Access Diagnostics subsidiary of J.& J. last year. The former executive, Elliott Millenson, said that the arbitration ruling would force J.& J., a maker of health and pharmaceutical products with its base in New Brunswick, N.J., to return the Confide at-home H.I.V. test to him so that he can resell it to other investors. The company, however, denied that it has to return the H.I.V.-test technology, for which it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in May.
1996-07-17	J. & J. Results Cheer Investors; Eli Lilly Profits Stir Concerns	Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly & Company both reported earnings gains yesterday for the second quarter. But after looking hard at the results, investors showed their approval of Johnson & Johnson and displayed concerns about Lilly. Johnson & Johnson, the big diversified pharmaceutical and health products company, said its net income rose 19.7 percent, slightly exceeding Wall Street's forecasts.
1996-07-04	F.D.A. Approves Sale of Nicotine Patch Without Prescription	The Food and Drug Administration approved the first nicotine patch for sale without prescription today to help smokers give up their habit. The decision means that McNeil Consumer Products, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, would be able to beat its competitors to the pharmacy shelves with a one-dose nicotine patch, Nicotrol, that smokers are supposed to use for no longer than six weeks.
1996-06-20	Suit Accuses J.& J. Unit of Trade Spying	The Bohringer Mannheim Corporation filed a Federal suit today against a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, charging industrial espionage in the market for diabetes-treatment products. The suit, which also names the parent company, contends that employees of the unit, Lifescan, spied on Bohringer Mannheim for at least 17 months and stole its products and confidential documents.
1996-04-26	COMPANY BRIEFS	JOHNSON & JOHNSON New Brunswick, N.J., said its board had approved a 2-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend 15 percent, to 38 cents a share, from 33 cents previously. Both the dividend and the stock split will be for shareholders of record as of May 21.
1996-04-17	Drug Makers Raise Profits 20% or More	Spurred by strong sales of relatively new products, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc. both reported earnings spurts yesterday that exceeded 20 percent in the first quarter. Both companies were expected to outpace the rest of the pharmaceutical industry. Pfizer, based in New York, said net income jumped 23 percent, to $517 million, or 81 cents a share, from $420 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier, as sales rose nearly 15 percent, to $2.68 billion.
1996-04-09	Alpharma Gets Approvals	Alpharma Inc. said today that it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market treatments for baldness, Minoxidil Topical Solution, and for vaginal yeast infections, Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream. Minoxidil is the generic equivalent of Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc.'s Rogaine, which has annual sales of about $100 million. Miconazole is the generic form of Monistat-7 Vaginal Cream, made by Johnson & Johnson's Ortho unit. It and similar products have annual sales in excess of $100 million.
1996-04-05	BOSTON SCIENTIFIC UNIT IS SUED FOR PATENT INFRINGEMENT	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had filed a patent suit against the Boston Scientific Corporation's Scimed unit for infringement on technology used to install mechanical heart stents. The suit, filed in a Minneapolis court, relates to materials used in balloons made by Scimed for its Bandit brand balloon catheter. Johnson & Johnson said Scimed was infringing five of its patents. In balloon angioplasty, a catheter is snaked through blood vessels until it reaches a clog. At that point, the balloon is inflated to break up and push back the plaque that causes clogs. Such clogs can lead to heart attacks. Boston Scientific shares fell 87.5 cents, to $45.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
1996-02-16	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;Johnson & Johnson's latest campaign is part of a novel trend: beauty ads with some basis in fact.	"ADVERTISING for skin care, beauty and cosmetics brands has long been more likely to make glamorous, emotional appeals than offer dispassionate presentations about product performance. That was because, in most instances, marketers recognized they were selling hope in a jar, as Charles Revson liked to proclaim, rather than anything that they could prove under regulatory scrutiny actually worked. So Lord & Thomas asserted a woman would ""keep that schoolgirl complexion"" by washing with Palmolive soap. J. Walter Thompson offered a declaration for cold cream from which consumers were to infer cause and effect: ""She's young. She's lovely. She uses Pond's."" And the ""skin you love to touch,"" a Thompson slogan for Woodbury soap, even found its way into the lyrics of Cole Porter's ""From This Moment On."""
1996-01-25	J.& J.'s Profit Was Up 23% In 4th Quarter	Johnson & Johnson said today that earnings rose 23 percent in the fourth quarter -- more than expected -- lifted by strong sales of new drugs and medical devices. The company, which makes Band-Aids and other health care products, said net income rose to $465 million, or 72 cents a share, from $378 million, or 59 cents a share, in the corresponding period of 1994. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had expected a per-share figure of 68 cents.
1996-01-23	JOHNSON & JOHNSON WILL COMPLETE PURCHASE OF CORDIS	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would complete its $1.8 billion purchase of the Cordis Corporation, a medical device maker, ending weeks of uncertainty about whether the deal would go through. Cordis shares soared $7.8125, or almost 8 percent, to $107.5625, in Nasdaq trading. Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health-care-products company, spurred worries last month about its $109-a-share acquisition, saying it needed an extra month to go over Cordis's books. Johnson & Johnson refused to say what it was looking for and Cordis shares plunged 11 percent in one day. Although Johnson & Johnson still would not say what it found, the two companies said that Cordis's shareholders would meet on Feb. 23 to give final approval to the deal.

Janssen will perform clinical trials, submit regulatory applications and market Medeva's hepatitis treatment locally. Analysts said the drug, called hepagene, could be a big sales generator for the British drug maker if clinical trials proved it was effective as a treatment for existing carriers of hepatitis B in addition to being a vaccine to prevent contracting the disease.

1995-11-07	Cordis to Be Acquired by Johnson & Johnson	The Cordis Corporation agreed yesterday to be acquired by Johnson & Johnson after its buyout offer was raised to $1.8 billion in stock from $1.6 billion.

1995-11-02	CORDIS REJECTS OFFERS FROM JOHNSON & JOHNSON	"The Cordis Corporation rejected Johnson & Johnson's $1.6 billion hostile takeover bid yesterday, calling the $100-a-share cash offer inadequate. Cordis, a Miami-based maker of medical devices to treat heart disease, also rejected Johnson & Johnson's offer to negotiate a stock swap valued at $1.7 billion, or $105 a share. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., said it would press ahead with plans to remove the Cordis board through a consent solicitation and called its $105-a- share offer ""full and fair."" Johnson & Johnson, the nation's largest maker of health care products and drugs, made the bids on Oct. 19 after Cordis refused to meet to discuss a merger. Shares of Cordis rose $1.75 yesterday, to $112.25, a 52-week high on the New York Stock Exchange."
1995-10-25	CORDIS CHANGES BYLAWS IN RESPONSE TO TAKEOVER BID	The Cordis Corporation responded to a hostile $1.6 billion takeover bid from Johnson & Johnson yesterday by changing its bylaws to require that its board receive advance notice before any potential suitor can make a direct appeal to its shareholders. Johnson & Johnson answered Cordis promptly by serving Cordis with the appropriate request. The change in Cordis's corporate bylaws was small, but the effect could be to delay an unwanted bid from Johnson & Johnson or other unfriendly buyers. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., offered on Thursday to acquire Cordis for $100 a share. Cordis, based in Miami, has said it will consider the offer.
1995-10-21	CORDIS ASKS DELAY ON JOHNSON & JOHNSON OFFER	"The Cordis Corporation urged shareholders yesterday not to make any decision about Johnson & Johnson's unsolicited $1.6 billion tender offer until it had reviewed the proposal. Cordis said it would consider the offer ""in due course"" and would announce a decision no later than Nov. 2.

1995-10-20	Johnson & Johnson Makes Bid for Unwilling Cordis	Frustrated by months of fruitless and largely one-way dialogue about a friendly merger, Johnson & Johnson announced yesterday that it intended to make an unsolicited $1.6 billion tender offer for the Cordis Corporation, a manufacturer of cardiology devices. The cash tender offer amounts to $100 a share. But in a letter to Robert C. Strauss, chairman and chief executive of Cordis, Ralph S. Larsen, Johnson & Johnson's chairman and chief executive, said the company was willing to negotiate a tax-free transaction worth $105 a share.

The company, a maker of pharmaceutical and medical products based in New Brunswick, N.J., said clinical studies found that Ultram, which is intended to treat moderate to moderately severe pain, was less likely to cause the gastrointestinal side effects associated with rival medications. Analysts said Ultram would not be a ""blockbuster drug,"" but would help to extend the Johnson & Johnson product line. Ultram, whose generic name is tramadol, was developed by Germany's Grunenthal G.m.b.H. in 1977. Ultram is aimed at people who suffer from arthritis or lower back pain."
1995-01-25	3 Health Care Companies Report Big Profit Advances	Three big health care companies yesterday reported double-digit profit increases for the fourth quarter of 1994, helped by higher unit sales and a weaker dollar overseas. Net income in the quarter increased by 14.7 percent at Merck & Company and 12.8 percent at Johnson & Johnson. The Warner-Lambert Company said its net would have increased 16 percent, not counting a charge against 1993 earnings.
1995-01-05	Johnson to Buy Mitek Surgical Products	Hoping to expand the market for a new generation of surgical aids that tie tissue to bone, Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would acquire Mitek Surgical Products Inc. for $128 million in stock.

1994-11-13	Johnson & Johnson Sued Over Dismissal	"A former senior research scientist at Johnson & Johnson is claiming in Federal court that he was dismissed when he resisted pressure to present ""inadequate and misleading"" test data to win quick Food and Drug Administration approval for a new treatment for cancer and other diseases, like AIDS. Dr. Daniel Tripodi, 55, asserted that his career was abruptly derailed after he was assigned by Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health products company, to guide the development of the device, called Centrinet. He is seeking more than $3 million in damages for lost pay and other benefits in a civil jury trial that started last week."
1994-10-29	Sweetener May Perk Up Diet Drink Sales	"A no-calorie sweetener, promoted as more versatile and stable than the ubiquitous Nutrasweet, could put a kick back into the diet soft-drink market.

It may also fatten sales at Johnson & Johnson if the pharmaceutical giant can persuade the Food and Drug Administration to allow it to sell the substance the company calls Splenda."
1994-10-21	Liver Patient Wins Suit Against Maker of Tylenol	A Federal court jury in suburban Virginia awarded $8.8 million today to a former White House aide who said the loss of his liver had resulted from his taking the pain reliever Tylenol in combination with his regular dinner consumption of wine.

1994-10-20	JOHNSON & JOHNSON (JNJ,N)	"Johnson & Johnson reported an increase of 15.6 percent in its profits for the third quarter, as worldwide sales rose and costs were reduced. ""It was a blowout quarter,"" said Samuel Isaly of Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Drug Research."
1994-09-08	Market Place; A novel approach from Johnson & Johnson: It isn't downsizing.	WITH its latest big acquisitions, Johnson & Johnson seems to be bucking a trend in industrial consolidations. The big health care company said it was filling out and expanding its product lines and did not plan to squeeze cost savings from the new units by dismissing hundreds of their employees. The two most recent deals -- the $1.01 billion purchase of Eastman Kodak's diagnostic products that was announced on Tuesday and the pending $924 million acquisition of the Neutrogena Corporation -- would not dilute profits, analysts said. And by adding two profitable units to the 167 operating companies in its international roster, Johnson & Johnson bolstered its position as the world's largest diversified health care company.
1994-09-07	Johnson & Johnson to Buy Kodak Division	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it would buy Eastman Kodak's diagnostics products division, which includes machines that can run hundreds of chemical tests an hour, for $1.008 billion in cash. The transaction would be the second big acquisition for Johnson & Johnson in recent weeks and an important step in Kodak's efforts to sell off parts of the company not related to pictures and images.
1994-08-30	Drug Unit Being Sold By Kodak	SmithKline Beecham, the British pharmaceutical giant, said yesterday that it would buy the Sterling Winthrop over-the-counter drug business of the Eastman Kodak Company for $2.93 billion in cash. The acquisition, SmithKline said, would make it the world's largest producer of nonprescription medicines, with annual sales of $2 billion.
1994-08-23	Johnson To Acquire Neutrogena	Johnson & Johnson agreed today to pay $924 million for the Neutrogena Corporation, giving the big health care and consumer products company a strong mass-market brand for its expanding skin and hair care business. The acquisition of Neutrogena, which makes premium brand health care products for women, reflects the continuing consolidation of consumer products into the hands of companies with strong international distribution systems, analysts said. Last month, for example, Avon sold Giorgio Beverly Hills to Procter & Gamble in order to concentrate on its core cosmetics business. P.& G. has been building its international fragrance business since 1991, when it purchased Max Factor from Revlon. Overseas Opportunities For Johnson & Johnson, overseas opportunities are among Neutrogena's biggest draws. Only about a fourth, or $72 million, of Neutrogena's $307 million in projected sales this year will come from abroad, according to Diana Temple, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. That is much less than at other personal care products companies. Avon and Gillette, for instance, each derive about two-thirds of their sales overseas, she said.
1994-08-10	CIBA VISION TO BUY JOHNSON & JOHNSON UNIT	Ciba Vision agreed yesterday to buy the ophthalmic product line of the Iolab Corporation, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, for $300 million.
1994-07-21	Big Drug Companies Post Strong Earnings	Four of five big health care companies reported strong earnings growth yesterday in the second quarter, and all five announced double-digit gains in United States pharmaceutical sales.

Despite pressure on prices by managed care insurers and Government Medicaid programs, domestic pharmaceutical sales rose 23 percent at the Schering-Plough Corporation, 16 percent at Pfizer Inc., 12 percent at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and 10 percent at Merck & Company.
1994-07-02	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Thursday, about the Johnson & Johnson Company's home testing kit for cholesterol, misstated the current name of the cholesterol-testing device manufactured by Chemtrak Inc. The device is now known as Accu Meter; Cholestrak is its old name.
1994-06-30	Johnson's Cholesterol Kits Set	The Johnson & Johnson Company said yesterday that it had begun shipping the first federally approved home-test kit for cholesterol, the artery-clogging component in blood that raises the risk of heart disease. The kits, already on the shelves at some Pathmark stores in the East and some Safeway grocery stores on the West Coast, are to be available at supermarkets and pharmacies nationwide for $15 to $20 in a few weeks. Johnson & Johnson said it expected to sell two million units during the next 12 months.
1994-06-06	P.& G. Sues Former Officials Over Rights	In the most recent example of a corporation seeking protection of intellectual property rights, the Procter & Gamble Company has filed suit against two former executives and their new employer, Johnson & Johnson Inc., contending breach of contract. In the lawsuit, filed on May 27 in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in Ohio, Cincinnati-based P.& G. asked the court to bar the executives from working for three years on what it said were competitive products at Johnson & Johnson. The suit also demands that Johnson & Johnson stop recruiting its employees and seeks unspecified monetary damages.
1994-04-29	JOHNSON & JOHNSON (JNJ,N)	Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest diversified health care company, reported solid earnings growth yesterday, with profits rising nearly 8.2 percent, to $544 million, in the first quarter from the comparable period a year earlier.

1994-04-20	Corrections	The New York Stock Exchange tables in Business Day on Saturday and in the Business section on Sunday misstated Friday's prices for Johnson & Johnson stock.

1994-02-18	U.S. Surgical	The United States Surgical Corporation, a large maker of surgical equipment, saw its shares plunge yesterday after it lost an important patent-infringement suit it had brought against Johnson & Johnson. United States Surgical also warned of an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss. Wall Street analysts rushed to downgrade their assessments of the stock.
1994-02-17	U.S. Surgical Seeks Cash, Loses Suit	The United States Surgical Corporation said yesterday that it was seeking new sources of cash after posting losses for the last nine months of 1993 and also announced that it had lost a patent infringement lawsuit against its main competitor, Johnson & Johnson. This bad news hammered the company's stock, which fell $5.625 a share, or 21 percent, to $21.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading had been suspended for almost five hours yesterday while the exchange awaited the company's announcement. The stock had traded at $118 a share in April 1992.
1994-02-02	JOHNSON & JOHNSON (N)	Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest diversified health care company, said yesterday that sales were reduced in the fourth quarter and throughout 1993 by worldwide pressures to hold down prices and by the strength of the dollar overseas. Profits rose 9.1 percent, to $335 million, in the fourth quarter, compared with the quarter a year earlier. Sales in the quarter were flat.
1993-12-22	FISHER SCIENTIFIC BUYS EASTMAN KODAK UNIT	Fisher Scientific International said it had purchased the organic chemical operations of the Eastman Kodak Company and agreed to purchase Janssen Chimica, a division of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen subsidiary of Belgium. Terms of the purchase agreement and letter of intent were not disclosed, but Fisher said the companies being acquired together have about $35 million in sales. The acquisitions greatly expand Fisher Scientific's organic chemical operations, said Norman Ritter, a company spokesman. The letter of intent signed for the Janssen operations is still subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and other related procedures.
1993-12-07	Johnson & Johnson Loosens Y.& R. Link	Johnson & Johnson has further loosened its ties with Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York, saying yesterday that it would transfer the American network-television buying portion of its estimated $220 million account to McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York, effective Jan. 3. Though F. Robert Kniffin, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman in New Brunswick, N.J., declined to elaborate, Advertising Age reported this week that a review on the assignment did not include Y.& R. It listed as the participants McCann and three other large New York shops that are core Johnson & Johnson agencies: DDB Needham Worldwide, Lintas Worldwide and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising.
1993-11-19	Johnson to Buy Skin-Care Line	Johnson & Johnson plans to buy a European skin-care line for an undisclosed sum, giving the American company a leading brand in France where its own products have gained little consumer acceptance. The health-care-products company is buying the Roc line from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A. the French luxury-goods conglomerate. LVMH was reportedly negotiating a sale price of $170 million, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported.
1993-10-24	Finding Surprises In Corporate Galleries	DISCOVERING craft objects on the walls and pedestals of an art gallery can be a novel experience for some people. The surprise is magnified when those walls and pedestals are right smack on the first floor of the company where they work or do business. In the galleries at the Johnson & Johnson World Headquarters in New Brunswick and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in Lawrenceville, employees and visitors are stopping to look and pick their favorite craft objects, often after a long, pithy discussion.
1993-09-07	Johnson & Johnson Moves Assignment	"Johnson & Johnson has moved another assignment out of Young & Rubicam New York, transferring the responsibilities for print media buying to Advanswers in St. Louis, effective in January. Advanswers has handled assignments for Johnson & Johnson since 1974. The shift was ""made as an outgrowth"" of an ongoing agency realignment, Johnson & Johnson said last week in a statement. The changes have resulted in Y.& R. New York losing its creative assignments on company brands like Band-Aid and Shower to Shower."
1993-08-19	An Alliance of 6 Big Consumers Vows to Use More Recycled Paper	By the end of the decade, Prudential insurance policies, Johnson & Johnson Band-Aid boxes and Time Warner's billion copies of magazines a year may all be made of recycled paper, under a project announced yesterday by these and other companies working with the Environmental Defense Fund. The project, which will start with feasibility studies, is aimed at reducing the burden on landfills and pumping up the anemic market for recycled paper by creating demand for billions of dollars worth of secondhand pulp.
1993-08-12	Johnson Is Cutting 3,000 Jobs	Joining a surge of cost-cutting in the drug and health care industries, Johnson & Johnson announced plans yesterday to eliminate 3,000 jobs worldwide this year through early retirements and layoffs. The big diversified health care company said it would offer early retirement incentives to 1,000 employees in the United States, including 200 at its headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., and that an additional 2,000 employees would lose their jobs in a corporate restructuring.
1993-07-29	"CURRENTS;
Making a Big Splash at Home"	"THE ads on subway trains claim that New York's most spectacular new home belongs not to an heiress, a film star or Donald Trump, but to a sea otter named Bunky at the country's oldest aquarium, in Coney Island. Built for $22 million, you could call it the otter limits.

Home is a series of five pools surrounded by concrete forms that mimic the California coast. Known as Sea Cliffs, it was built as part of a renovation program at the Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation, formerly known as the New York Aquarium."
1993-07-23	Johnson & Johnson Reshuffles Accounts	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had completed the long-awaited series of product account shifts among its agencies. The move, part of a worldwide realignment, elevated DDB Needham Worldwide in New York to a more vital role as its fourth worldwide agency. Now with more than $30 million in billings, up from $5 million, DDB Needham joins Lintas Worldwide in New York, McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York as the agencies handling the company's major consumer products.
1993-06-16	JOHNSON & JOHNSON DEVELOPS NEW CONTACT LENSES	Johnson & Johnson said it had developed the world's first disposable contact lens designed for only one day of use before replacement.
1993-06-15	Diabetes Report May Lift Sales of Medical Devices	A group of medical technology companies stands to benefit from a new research report showing that the devastating complications of diabetes can be prevented or delayed by monitoring blood-sugar levels more closely and increasing injections of insulin. The primary beneficiaries should be manufacturers of monitoring equipment, like the Lifescan Inc. unit of Johnson & Johnson. But makers of insulin delivery systems, like Minimed Technologies Inc., should also see more demand for their products, which are an alternative to syringes.
1993-03-24	Johnson & Johnson Official Named President at Celgene	Thomas H. Odiorne, a senior executive at Johnson & Johnson, was appointed yesterday as president and chief operating officer of the Celgene Corporation, a start-up biotechnology company that is developing processes to cleanse hazardous waste and make drugs safer.

Ufheil, 59, when Mr. Ufheil retires at the end of his contract.

1992-12-27	Making a Difference; From Johnson & Johnson, a Free Software Solution	BUSINESSES hate to waste time and money reinventing the wheel when they can save both by using an existing idea. While that is usually no big deal, software is often the exception. Companies tend to be very proprietary about sharing programs they developed to give them an edge over their competitors.
1992-11-10	Surgery Unit Of Johnson In Contract	Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that it had signed a contract with Volunteer Hospitals of America that could generate $1.2 billion in sales of surgical equipment over the next five years. Volunteer Hospitals, an alliance of 680 nonprofit hospitals, agreed to urge its members to buy minimally invasive surgical instruments made by Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon Endo-Surgery unit. Such orders could total about $115 million a year.
1992-10-29	JOHNSON & JOHNSON SUSPENDS OUTPUT OF A SWEETENER	Johnson & Johnson suspended production of its artificial sweetener as it awaits clearance to sell the product in the United States and other countries. The current stockpile of the product, called Sucralose, is enough to meet demand for the foreseeable future, a spokesman said yesterday. The halt caused the health-care company to lay off 25 people in New Jersey and 35 in Georgia. The company said it did not know when it would resume production. Sucralose now sells only in Canada, where the company was cleared to market the product in September 1991. The company's shares rose 37.5 cents yesterday, to $49.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
1992-10-21	Several Drug Concerns Post Improved Earnings	Several pharmaceutical and health-care companies reported improved earnings yesterday, partly as a result of a strong demand for new products and a weak dollar that bolstered overseas revenues.

Tattle, the 49-year-old Canadian recently promoted to group chairman in charge of about half of Johnson & Johnson's stable of pharmaceutical companies, says his main job ""is building on progress we have already made."" For that, Mr. Tattle says his exposure to Johnson & Johnson's overseas pharmaceutical business operations over the last seven years will come in handy. ""You not only need to come up with unique products these days, but they have to demonstrate a good cost/ benefit profile,"" he said, referring to the growing pressures to reduce drug prices in the United States. In most overseas markets, drug companies have already adapted to lower markups.

The killings marked the first such product tampering and instilled a new kind of fear in consumers who had taken for granted the safety of the over-the-counter products in their medicine chests. For their part, manufacturers were forced to rethink packaging to incorporate the stamp ""tamper-resistant."" Last week, nearly nine years later, the last of the litigation surrounding the deaths ended when the maker of Tylenol agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to the families of the Chicago victims.

Ms. Symchych's order also forces Johnson & Johnson to stop selling the tape or pay royalties. The tape allows broken bones to be mobilized quickly. Johnson & Johnson, of New Brunswick, N.J., maintained that its product was on the market before the 3M patents were issued. ""There never was any intent to willfully infringe any patents and we will vigorously appeal the decision."" said a Johnson & Johnson spokesman, Jeffrey Leebaw."

The brownish peat pads began appearing on grocery shelves in Canada several weeks ago, a spokesman, Robert Kniffin, said. The company, based in New Brunswick, plans to sell the product in the United States but will not say when. The peat moss pad absorbs as well as standard sanitary napkins but is one-fifth as thick and therefore more comfortable, Mr. Kniffin said. Moss is also a ""natural plant"" that ""naturally absorbs"" as it moves liquid away from the pad's center through capillaries that keep it dry, he said."
1991-02-13	Ads for Tums Upset a Rival	"The manufacturer of Mylanta anatacid is the latest corporation to accuse its competitor's comparitive advertising of being unfair and innacurate. Johnson & Johnson Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals, which makes Mylanta, filed a lawsuit Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan against the SmithKline Beecham Corporation, the manufacturer of Tums antacid. The suit said that a Tums television campaign had falsely said that Tums, which contains calcium, was safer and more nutritious than Mylanta, which contains aluminum and magnesium compounds. ""We did consumer surveys to see what message people took from Tums advertising,"" said Bob Kniffin, a spokesman for the maker of Mylanta, a joint venture of Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Company. ""We determined that a significant number of people would be reluctant to take an antacid containing aluminum or magnesium."" Donna Furdis, a spokeswoman for SmithKline, said the campaign provides a ""truthful"" representation of the two products and does not discuss their safety. ""The ad was designed to insure that consumers are informed that Tums is an effective antacid and an excellent source of calcium carbonate,"" she said. The lawsuit seeks corrective ads from SmithKline and a court order barring SmithKline from making such claims in future commercials."

District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry said the insurance policies for McNeil Laboratories Inc. did not cover the recall and that Johnson & Johnson, its parent, had elected not to buy more expensive recall insurance.
1986-09-17	Advertisers' Chairman	G.F. (Pete) Tyrrell, vice president of advertising at Johnson & Johnson, has been elected vice chairman of the Association of National Advertisers, replacing Robert F. Lauterborn, who has resigned to assume the James L. Knight Professorship of Advertising at the School of Journalism at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
1986-08-29	Frigitronics Unit Faces Sale	Revlon Inc. said yesterday that it would sell the intraocular-lens business of Frigitronics Inc. to Johnson & Johnson as soon as Revlon completes its previously announced attempt to gain control of the eye-care equipment concern. Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $100 million for the lens business and other Frigitronics assets, including 500,000 shares of Medchem Products Inc. common stock.
1986-07-05	JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S RECOVERY	In February a cyanide-laced Tylenol capsule killed a woman in Yonkers, leading Johnson & Johnson to remove all capsule forms of the product from the market. Despite the incident, Tylenol retained its position as the nation's best-selling analgesic and five months later is selling 96 percent of what it sold before the tampering, the company says. The brand's rebound, after sales fell by about one-third, was even swifter than its recovery following a poisoning episode in 1982, in which seven people died in the Chicago area. ''I don't know that there's a case on record of a brand that has taken two shots to the head like that and come right back,'' said Benjamin Lipstein, the chairman of National Brand Scanning Inc., a market research concern. ''It's amazing.'' As increasing numbers of companies must cope with product tampering, the story of Tylenol's performance provides a case study of effective crisis management.

For Lowe Marschalk, a joint venture of the Interpublic Group of Companies and Lowe Howard-Spink & Bell of London, the job is coming from Chesebrough-Pond's, which was already on its client list.
1986-06-12	Lawsuit Fear Cuts Contraceptive Choices	To the Editor: The contraception options available to couples are dwindling fast. Last Feb. 1, G.D. Searle & Company halted sale of its intrauterine contraceptive devices in the United States, citing the high cost of defending lawsuits. Johnson & Johnson's Ortho division removed its IUD from the market last September.
1986-06-06	Advertising; J.&J.'s Medipren Goes To Lowe Marschalk	Lowe Marschalk has been designated as agency for Johnson & Johnson's ibuprofen entry, Medipren, which it will be able to sell in September. Until then exclusive rights on marketing such products are held by Bristol-Myers, which has Nuprin, and American Home Products, whose product is Advil.
1986-06-03	COMMON CRIB TOYS CALLED DANGEROUS	The Consumer Product Safety Commission today moved to recall 1.6 million crib toys sold by Johnson & Johnson and said the toys are a strangulation hazard. A complaint authorized in a 3 to 1 vote said that two babies had strangled on the toys or on string used to tie them across cribs. The toys, Soft Triplets, Piglet Crib Gym and Triplets Marching Band, consist of three soft figures holding hands in a line held together by elastic.
1986-05-25	JOHNSON & JOHNSON GIFT FINANCING MEDICAL-TECHNOLOGY WORK	"SOME of the $7.5 million that Johnson & Johnson, the New Brunswick-based health-care products company, donated to medical research and public-interest projects last month to mark its 100th anniversary already is paying for sophisticated technology programs.

The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, with $3.24 million, and Rutgers University, with $2 million, were the principal recipients.

In addition, the campaign to establish a Center for Science and Technology (a museum) at Liberty State Park in Jersey City received $1.5 million, the Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology in Newark got $400,000 and the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Foundation, $320,000.

1986-04-30	Woman on West Coast Takes Tylenol and Dies	A university laboratory technician who collapsed after taking two Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules died of cyanide poisoning, a coroner said today. Detectives said they have not ruled out the possibility that the technician, Sandie Lynn Gregory, 21 years old, committed suicide Sunday.
1986-04-02	SIGNS OF PROGRESS SNIFF	Those glad they've lived long enough to witness the birth of the toothpaste pump and spray-on hair coloring have a new reason to hope for continued health. Someday they may be able to hail the first contraceptive activated by a deep breath. A California company has developed a nasal-drug delivery system, which it has licensed to Johnson & Johnson to make a contraceptive spray using the hormone LHRH.
1986-03-05	PAINKILLER IN TYLENOL IS LINKED TO LIVER DAMAGE IN ALCOHOLICS	Medical scientists warned yesterday that acetaminophen, the painkiller in Tylenol and many other aspirin substitutes, can cause serious liver damage in alcoholics. Two experts recommended that chronic, heavy drinkers not use the drug and called on the Federal Government to require that warnings of the danger be included on product labels. ''This is an underappreciated problem,'' said Dr. Edward J. Huth, editor of The Annals of Internal Medicine, which is publishing a new report on the problem today. A medical spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Tylenol, which has been the nation's most popular acetaminophen product, responded that such cases of liver damage were rare and confined to severe alcoholics who had exceeded the recommended dosage. The spokesman said company officials had not yet had a chance to review the new study and were concerned that it would create unwarranted alarm because it was appearing in a climate of public fear about the safety of Tylenol products.
1986-03-02	F.B.I. Says Tylenol Had Been Opened	To find out who put cyanide in two packages of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules found in Westchester County, investigators first have to figure out how and where they were poisoned. The Federal Bureau of Investigation still did not have the answer last week, but it did uncover a clue.
1986-02-27	BOTTLE TAMPERING IN TYLENOL FOUND	An F.B.I. official said yesterday that a detailed examination of the bottles in Westchester County that held cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules found there had been tampering with the packaging. This finding reverses earlier statements by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and appears to expand the range of possibilites in the case. Law-enforcement officials familiar with the case said the F.B.I. reversed its initial finding, that the bottles had not been tampered, with after specialists conducted a sophisticated forensic examination. Support for Theory These officials said they believed that while the bottles could have been tampered with anywhere between manufacture and sale, the new evidence gave some weight to the theory that the integrity of the packaging was violated and the bottles and boxes resealed after the product had been shipped from its two manufacturing sites.
1986-02-26	Cyanide Investigated in Death NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 25 (AP) -	Traces of cyanide were found in the body of a 32-year-old man and in an Extra-Strength Tylenol capsule found in a bottle under the bed he died in, officials said today. Dr. Charles Harlan, Metro Nashville medical examiner, said: ''The preliminary reports indicate that cyanide was found in the capsule and in the body of the man.
1986-02-26	CORRECTION	Because of an editing error, an article Sunday on Johnson & Johnson's handling of the Tylenol crisis misstated the company's sales during 1985. They totaled $6.42 billion.
1986-02-23	TYLENOL: DESPITE SHARP DISPUTES, MANAGERS COPED	Almost from the moment on Feb. 10 when the news broke that a Westchester County woman had died after taking a cyanide-laced Tylenol capsule, Johnson & Johnson found itself racing to stay in control of a rapidly changing situation. As consumer fears mounted, the company had to move quickly to ensure public safety yet prevent the episode from becoming a staggering blow. What has become clear, through interviews with James E. Burke, the company chairman, and other Johnson & Johnson officials, is that once the company found itself embroiled in yet another product-related death, following a spate of similar crimes in 1982, the aim was to control consumer reaction, exercise damage control and make the best of a bad situation. It was not always easy, nor was it accomplished without sharp disputes among executives, with some of them shouting at each other in discussions over what to do next. Corporate managers always have to strike a balance between the demands of various constituencies: customers, employee groups, suppliers and shareholders. But how Mr. Burke and Johnson & Johnson reacted in the latest Tylenol crisis offers a glimpse into the process in the midst of a highly charged atmosphere.
1986-02-23	Tylenol Maker Drops Capsules	After seven people died from cyanide-tainted Tylenol in 1982, Johnson & Johnson, the drug's manufacturer, put seals on its over-the-counter products, and the Government forced the entire pharmaceutical industry to follow suit. Last week, nine days after cyanide in Extra-Strength Tylenol killed a Westchester County woman, the company announced another bold step: the discontinuation of capsules in its nonprescription medications.
1986-02-20	JOHNSON BOUGHT, THEN REJECTED, LOCKING CAPSULES	In 1984, two years after seven people died from cyanide-tainted Tylenol capsules in Chicago, Johnson & Johnson purchased a new system that claimed to make capsules tamper resistant. But Johnson & Johnson decided against using the new technique, saying it found the system wanting. The system, developed by the Troy-based R. P. Scherer Corporation, the world's largest producer of soft gelatin capsules and a major manufacturer of empty hard-shell capsules, uses sound waves to lock together the two pieces of hard gelatin that form the capsule. The Warner-Lambert Company had brought out the first system for sealing hard-shell capsules a year earlier. And a tamper-resistant system of sealing the soft gelatin capsules that are used for vitamins and substances such as bath oil had already been on the market for some time.
1986-02-20	TYLENOL MAKER HOPEFUL ON SOLVING POISONING CASE	The chairman of Johnson & Johnson said today that the cyanide poisoning case in Westchester County, N.Y., involving his company's Tylenol capsules should be easier to solve than similar killings in the Chicago area in 1982. The chairman, James E. Burke, did not suggest that any arrest was expected shortly in the death of a 23-year-old woman who took two capsules laced with cyanide. He said, however, that logic pointed toward easier solution in the Westchester case because the two bottles of Tylenol capsules tainted with cyanide had been in stores in the same neighborhood in Bronxville. By comparison, he said, the tampering in Chicago involved perhaps a dozen bottles in many stores over a much wider area.
1986-02-19	A LEADER IN A CRISIS: JAMES EDWARD BURKE	In the days since Diane Elsroth died after taking cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol, James E. Burke, chairman of Johnson & Johnson, once again has had to deal with a public crisis. In doing so in a forthright way and with his decision to stop selling Tylenol in capsule form, Mr. Burke is receiving praise from analysts, marketing experts and from consumers themselves. ''I give him high marks for the way he has handled the situation thus far,'' said Stephen Greyser, a marketing professor at the Harvard Business School. Although the crisis is far from over, Mr. Burke is coming across both as a solid corporate citizen and an irrepressible corporate marketer, attributes that helped his rise to the top of the 100-year-old health-care company. And while most analysts predicted the demise of Tylenol and trouble for Johnson & Johnson's image after a wave of similar poisonings occurred in the Chicago area in 1982, they are much more optimistic this time.
1986-02-19	F.B.I. FINDS NO TAMPERING WITH PACKAGING OF TYLENOL	A Federal official said yesterday that investigators examining bottles that held cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules had found ''no evidence of tampering'' so far with the containers or their packaging. Nevertheless, the official, Milt Ahlerich, chief of public affairs for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the lack of evidence ''does not mean that the tampering did not occur.'' It was the first official statement by the F.B.I. on the analysis being conducted in Washington on the packaging of the Tylenol capsules. This development in the investigation into the death of Diane Elsroth, the 23-year-old woman who died Feb. 8 after taking two Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide, and the appearance four days later of a second bottle of tainted pills came as officials continued to look for the source of the poison.
1986-02-19	MANY DRUG MAKERS PLAN TO CONTINUE CAPSULE USE	An association of companies that make nonprescription drugs said today that its members had no intention of following the lead of Johnson & Johnson in withdrawing capsules from the market. ''It simply is not the solution,'' said John T. Walden, the spokesman for the pharmaceutical group, the Proprietary Association. Mr. Walden did not criticize Johnson & Johnson, which announced on Monday that it would no longer market its Tylenol or other nonprescription drugs in capsules. The company said it acted to prevent the kind of tampering that recently killed a Westchester County woman who took cyanide-laced capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol.
1986-02-19	JOHNSON URGINH PUBLIC TO TRY CAPLETS	To retain its leadership in the analgesic market after the recent Tylenol poisoning, Johnson & Johnson has embarked on a major advertising and public relations campaign to convince consumers that its caplets - coated, capsule-shaped tablets - work as well as capsules. While the company is providing few details of the campaign, Wall Street seems to have growing confidence that Johnson & Johnson can regain its footing. Its stock rose $1.375 yesterday, to $49.125 a share, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after losing $5.75 a share last week. The rise is an indication, according to analysts, that investors expect the company's earnings to rebound in 1987 after an expected 1986 after-tax cost of $150 million on Tylenol and other products sold in capsule form.
1986-02-18	Quotation of the Day	''We feel the company can no longer guarantee the safety of capsules to a degree consistent with Johnson & Johnson's standards of responsibility to its consumers.'' -James E. Burke, the chairman of Johnson & Johnson. [ A1:4. ]
1986-02-18	ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RAISED BY TYLENOL INQUIRY	On Saturday, Feb. 8, 23-year-old Diane Elsroth died after taking two Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide. The pills had been purchased at an A.&P. store in Bronxville, N.Y. An investigation was begun involving two local law-enforcement agencies, the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Four days later, Federal workers checking bottles of Tylenol capsules confiscated or turned in from stores in Westchester County discovered more tainted pills, this time in a bottle that had been on a shelf in a F. W. Woolworth store in Bronxville, a block from the A.&P. Authorities have said they have no suspects. The case echoed events in 1982, when seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Tylenol capsules that were also adulterated with potassium cyanide.
1986-02-18	MAKER OF TYLENOL DISCONTINUING ALL OVER-COUNTER DRUG CAPSULES	Johnson & Johnson yesterday discontinued the manufacture and sale of all its over-the-counter medications in capsule form to prevent the kind of tampering that recently killed a woman who took cyanide-laced capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol. The company also offered, at its expense, to replace about 15 million packages of its capsule products in stores and homes across the nation with caplets, which are oval-shaped tablets coated to make them easier to swallow. It said it hoped to rebuild the lost capsule market in less tamper-prone caplets and tablets. The phamaceutical concern, which markets scores of products and had sales of $6.4 billion last year, estimated that its withdrawal from capsules would cost $100 million to $150 million, after taxes. This will include the expenses of replacing six kinds of capsules already on the market and of retooling its plants, as well as other costs in trying to rebuild its market position.
1986-02-18	FUTURE OF CAPSULE PRODUCTS UNCERTAIN AT DRUG CONCERNS	Several manufacturers of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products said yesterday that they were undecided on whether to join Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Tylenol pain relievers, in halting production of their capsuled products. One company, the SmithKline Beckman Corporation, said it would wait before deciding whether to withdraw its capsuled products from the market. ''The cause of the Tylenol situation is not known,'' said Jeremy Heymsfeld, a spokesman for SmithKline, the maker of Contac cold and influenza medicine.
1986-02-17	INDUSTRY ANALYSTS DOUBT FUTURE OF DRUG CAPSULES	The recent discovery of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide has raised considerable doubt among drug industry analysts and marketing experts about the future use of capsules for over-the-counter drugs. In addition, marketers and analysts suggest that growing consumer resistance to capsules might compel Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, and other manufacturers to sell their capsuled products in another form, such as the so-called caplet, a tablet whose shape is similar to that of a capsule. Although Tylenol is the current target of tampering, the public has become increasingly aware that any product in capsule form is susceptible, marketing experts and analysts noted. ''This certainly does significantly affect all capsule products,'' said a professor of marketing at the Harvard Business School, John A. Quelch.
1986-02-16	Once Again, Tainted Tylenol And a Tragedy	The Federal Bureau of Investigation assigned its highest priority last week to the cyanide-stuffed Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules that killed a Westchester County woman, 23-year-old Diane Elsroth, and were found in another bottle of the painkiller also bought in the county. Five capsules in each bottle contained potassium cyanide, similar to the substance found in the Tylenol capsules that took the lives of seven people in Chicago and four suburbs in 1982, but not identical.
1986-02-15	DESPITE 'MYSTIQUE' OF CAPSULES, MANY DRUGS WORK IN OTHER FORMS	The recent discovery in Westchester County of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide has focused new attention on the use of capsules for drug delivery. When capsules were invented in the mid-19th century, they provided a significant improvement in the palatability of medications. But now, experts say, their vulnerability to tampering may outweigh their benefits, especially since advances in formulating tablets have made them easier to swallow.
1986-02-15	TYLENOL CAPSULE OUTPUT IS SUSPENDED BY MAKER	Johnson & Johnson announced today that it had suspended sales and production of all capsule forms of its Tylenol pain-reliever drug. The company also requested that retailers throughout the country stop selling the capsules until further notice. But at a news conference at the corporate headquarters here of the maker of health-care products, James E. Burke, its chairman, said that the company had no plans at this time to undertake a nationwide recall of the capsules. The company has initiated a recall in Westchester County, where poisoned Tylenol was found.
1986-02-15	A TRANQUIL VILLAGE IS SHAKEN BY AN INTRUSION OF MADNESS	From random evil and faceless terror, Mayor William J. Murphy lamented, there is no refuge, no safe port. ''The world's getting more and more problems,'' he said, ''and you can't build a wall around them.'' This community of 6,000 residents is the village of a romance movie or a fashion magazine, a quiet suburb of Tudor-style storefronts, charming lampposts and many fieldstone houses worth $1 million or more.
1986-02-15	F.B.I. IS ASSIGNING TYLENOL INQUIRY 'HIGHEST PRIORITY'	Federal investigators announced yesterday that they were giving the ''highest priority'' to the case of a woman who died in Yonkers after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol laced with cyanide. At the same time, Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical company that makes the pain remedy, said it had suspended production of the drug in capsule form. The case ''is extremely hot,'' said the chief spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, Milt Ahlerich, referring to the emphasis the bureau is placing on the events of the last seven days - the death of 23-year-old Diane Elsroth, the subsequent discovery Thursday of a second bottle of tainted capsules and the urging of public-health officials nationwide to avoid taking the drug. Mr. Ahlerich added that this, the most recent incident of apparent random murder by an unseen hand, had prompted the bureau to assemble a team of agents that is culling records in the Chicago area, where seven people died in 1982 after taking Tylenol capsules adulterated with cyanide. Banned by 14 States Meanwhile, 14 states - including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut - had banned the sale of Tylenol capsules by late last night, and Johnson & Johnson asked retailers to remove Tylenol capsules from their shelves. Health inspectors and police officers in New York City were canvassing stores yesterday to make sure the state's ban on sales was enforced.
1986-02-14	2D TAINTED BOTTLE OF TYLENOL FOUND BY INVESTIGATORS	Federal officials said yesterday that they had found a second bottle of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide that had been seized from a store in Westchester County. The discovery came five days after a woman died in Yonkers from a Tylenol capsule that contained the poison. In addition, a Federal official said a third bottle had been found in Westchester that had a single capsule contaminated with a minute amount of a substance ''that most likely is not cyanide.'' The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Frank E. Young, said the amount of the substance -possibly an industrial cleaner - was so minute that the capsule had been shipped to a lab in Cincinnati for a more definitive analysis. A spokesman for the F.D.A. in Rockville, Md., said last night that the bottle of Extra-Strength Tylenol that definitely contained the poison contained five capsules filled with potassium cyanide, the same substance that killed the woman, 23-year-old Diane Elsroth, on Saturday.
1986-02-14	SEAL ON DRUG PACKAGE CAN BE FORGED	Attempts to make tamper-proof containers are at least as old as the hollow clay tokens sealed with cuneiform writing that were used in commerce in ancient Mesopotamia. Then, as today, the object was to make a seal so difficult for a forger to reproduce that tampering would be immediately evident. Many of today's pharmaceutical products are protected either by specially formed plastic tapes or caps that must be broken by a user, or by metal foil laminated with plastic that must be torn. In some cases the protective plastic or metal is printed with a complex design difficult to reproduce.
1986-02-12	OFFICIALS SAY FATAL TAMPERING OF TYLENOL WAS ISOLATED CASE	Authorities investigating the case of a woman who died in Yonkers after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol tainted with cyanide said yesterday that they were convinced the death was an isolated case of tampering and that there was no reason to believe that other batches of the drug contained the poison. ''We don't intend to start a national scare, we don't believe the nation is smothered with tainted Tylenol,'' said Owen J. McClain, a deputy police chief in Yonkers, where the woman, Diane Elsroth, was found dead Saturday afternoon at the home of a friend she was visiting. Nevertheless, supermarkets and other stores across the country removed the popular pain remedy from their shelves. And public officials in New York State, New York City and elsewhere continued to warn users of the drug not to take it in capsule form. #10 Detectives on Case For Johnson & Johnson, the giant pharmaceutical company based in New Brunswick, N.J., whose subsidiary manufactures Tylenol, the death revived a crisis that the company hoped had ended more than three years ago. [ Page B4. ] While Chief McClain described the poisoning as a case of homicide and the work of a ''local perpetrator,'' he said little about the investigation, including what leads, if any, investigators - 10 Yonkers detectives are working on the case along with state troopers and Federal agents - had turned up or where the tampering might have taken place.
1986-02-12	TYLENOL MAKER FINDING NEW CRISIS LESS SEVERE	The announcement that a 23-year-old Peekskill, N.Y., woman died last weekend after taking a cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsule has rekindled a crisis for Johnson & Johnson that the company hoped had ended more than three years ago. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., is the pharmaceutical giant with a subsidiary, McNeil Consumer Products, that manufactures Tylenol. Johnson & Johnson has often been praised for its response to the 1982 cyanide poisonings of seven Chicago-area Tylenol users and its subsequent rehabilitation of the Tylenol brand. This time, most industry analysts say, Johnson & Johnson probably will not need to take drastic action to avoid a corporate disaster.
1986-02-11	TYLENOL IS LINKED TO A CYANIDE DEATH IN YONKERS	The A.&P. supermarket chain removed all containers of Tylenol capsules from its shelves late yesterday after a woman in Yonkers died of poisoning from cyanide believed to have come from an Extra-Strength Tylenol capsule. The Yonkers police said last night that a 23-year-old Peekskill woman died Saturday after taking the nonprescription pain reliever. The woman, Diane Elsroth, who was visiting a friend in Yonkers, had bought the drug at an A.&P. store in Bronxville. In reaction to the incident, the Federal Food and Drug Administration warned Yonkers-area residents to avoid using all Tylenol capsules and warned consumers not to use Tylenol from 200,000 bottles with the lot number ADF 916 and an expiration date of May 1987. The New York City Health Department last night also advised consumers to avoid all Tylenol capsules.
1986-01-14	JOHNSON & JOHNSON WINS PATENT RULING	A Federal judge has overturned a jury finding and ruled that a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson did not infringe upon a patent held by the Fonar Corporation.

''It just makes babies smell good for a while but can present a problem for any infant.
1985-11-28	Fonar Chairman Finds 'Justice for Little Guy'	Dr. Robert V. Damadian, founder and chairman of the Fonar Corporation, was understandably jubilant after a Federal District Court jury in Boston ruled last week that a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson had infringed upon a valid patent developed by Dr. Damadian and held by Fonar. The patent is for the magnetic resonance imaging system, a medical device that produces detailed pictures of the human body without using X-rays or injecting contrasting dyes. Dr. Damadian filed the patent for the machine in the late 1970's, shortly after he founded Fonar with four employees. He filed suit against Johnson & Johnson in 1982.
1985-11-23	PATENT SUIT IS WON BY FONAR	A Federal District Court jury has ruled that a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson infringed upon a valid patent held by the Fonar Corporation. The patent is for the magnetic resonance imaging system, a medical device that produces detailed pictures of the human body without using X-rays or injecting contrasting dyes. The decision means that Fonar, a small publicly held company based in Melville, L.I., could reap millions of dollars in damages and royalties from Johnson & Johnson. It could also affect the dozen or so other manufacturers of the the expensive machines.
1985-10-25	Johnson Net Up by 14.7%	Johnson & Johnson, the medical and institutional supplies company based in New Brunswick, N.J., said yesterday that third-quarter earnings rose 14.7 percent, to $158 million, or 87 cents a share, from $137.7 million, or 75 cents a share, a year ago. The company said that sales rose to $1.6 billion, a 6.7 percent increase from the $1.5 billion in the 1984 quarter.

1985-08-07	Carter-Wallace Action on Drug	Carter-Wallace Inc. said that it had suspended clinical testing of bepridil, a heart drug that has been linked to deaths among some patients using the drug in studies. The Carter-Wallace statement came one day after Johnson & Johnson said that its McNeil Pharmaceutical unit had suspended testing of bepridil on patients suffering from arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat.
1985-05-26	DRUG PRODUCTION TRIED IN SPACE	A 650-POUND pharmaceutical ''factory'' that accompanied the space shuttle Discovery last month could launch a $1-billion-a-year drug industry in space for a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. The refrigerator-sized machine, which has been on six shuttle flights, is being used to produce what industry officials hope will be a drug to help ''tens of millions of people.'' Its identity is a closely guarded secret.
1985-05-09	Market Place;   Analysts Favor A Drug Stock	AT a time when earnings of many multinational companies remain under pressure because of the strong dollar, analysts are raising their profit projections for Johnson & Johnson, one of Wall Street's ''Favorite Fifty'' stocks in the early 1970's. ''This is the kind of stock - a quality, defensive growth name - to own in the present uncertain market environment,'' Gene Gargiulo, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation, said yesterday. On Monday, the shares traded at 45 1/8, their highest price since late 1983. In mid-1984, the stock sold as low as 28. Yesterday, it closed at 45, up 1/8, on the New York Stock Exchange.
1985-05-03	Johnson & Johnson In a Restructuring	In a restructuring of its top management group, Johnson & Johnson yesterday named three members of its 13-member executive committee to head its main business segments worldwide, setting up what some analysts said would be a race for the leadership of the big health-care concern. The company named Robert E. Campbell, David E. Collins and Robert N. Wilson to the new posts of vice chairmen of the executive committee. They will report directly to David R. Clare, 59 years old, the committee's chairman, and president of the company. Mr. Clare reports to James E. Burke, 60, the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
1984-10-14	COMPANIES POUR MILLIONS INTO PROGRAMS AIMED AT KEEPING WORKERS WELL	On a recent lunch hour in the red- carpeted fitness center at Johnson & Johnson's aluminum-and-glass headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., 20 women in brightly patterned leotards stretched and bent to a background of soft rock music. Beth Benson, a 26-year-old programmer-analyst exercising alongside her colleagues, said the classes and running 10 to 15 miles a week had helped her to lose 20 pounds.

1983-10-30	DUAL FAILURE IN KIDNEY MACHINE BLAMED FOR 3 DEATHS IN DALLAS	A double failure in a machine that automatically prepares chemicals for kidney dialysis caused three patients here to suffer heart failure within minutes of one another Friday, the medical director of the Dallas Kidney Disease Center said today.

This led to cardiac arrest in three, who died less than an hour later despite resuscitation efforts at the Baylor University Medical Center. In an interview, Dr. Parker attributed the failure to both an electrical flaw in the machine when it was manufactured seven years ago and to a failure of a device meant to control the heating of the dialysis solution. The solution was overheated apparently because a backup electrical heater switched on while the main gas heater was still operating, he said.

Just days before, someone, whose identity is still unknown despite an investigation by hundreds of agents that has cost over $3 million, had purchased or shoplifted bottles of the painkiller from seven or eight supermarkets and drug stores and taken them home.
