Most consumer electronic devices like mobile phones, media players, cameras, laptops and e-book readers and so on come with power adapters that can handle a range of voltage and frequencies without an extra converter. If the label on your adapter says something like ''Input: 100-240VAC,'' with a reference to ''50-60 Hz,'' it should be fine operating in countries with electrical voltage running between 100 volts and 240 volts, and frequencies of 50 to 60 Hertz.

The revamped Chrome operating system, announced Tuesday by Google, plays high-definition video, has a rebuilt trackpad and is even designed to work on future touch-screen models. None of which matters if Google cannot get computers that use it out into the world, something that is proving as big a challenge as engineering Chrome. One thing is certain, however: Google is not giving up. It is heading to retail outlets, showcasing the machines as cheap and easy to manage corporate devices, and rethinking how it sells products for education. Executives involved with Chrome say Google doesn't care if it takes years for the Chrome operating system to catch on. (Google also calls its Web browser Chrome.)

2012-05-30	Books Under Glass: The Many Faces Of E-Readers	IN some ways, the only reason to stick with dead tree books these days is nostalgia. E-readers are more fully featured and much more impressive than ever, and they have fallen far below the $100 price tag because of improved technologies. If you are still content to read the latest Stephen King novel in its full five-pounds-of-paper glory, get ready to rethink your habits. First, a little about e-reader technologies. If you are looking for long battery life and great legibility, there are E Ink devices. E Ink screens contain millions of tiny, inklike ''spots'' that turn on and off just like the screen of an LCD, or liquid-crystal display. E Ink devices also show many shades of gray. And they have excellent battery life -- lasting sometimes as long as two months on standby. One problem? Except for one model, the Nook Simple Touch, they cannot be read in the dark.
2012-05-30	Thailand: Message Board Manager Sentenced Over Postings by Others	BANGKOK -- A Thai court sentenced the manager of an Internet message board to a one-year suspended prison term on Wednesday for comments posted by users that insulted the Thai royal family.

The manager of the site, Prachatai, a popular forum for discussions about politics and culture, was convicted of lèse-majesté, as royal insults are known, under Thailand's Computer Crimes Act. Courts in Thailand have jailed people convicted of lèse-majesté with increasing frequency in recent years, but the verdict on Wednesday was unusual in that the defendant, Chiranuch Premchaiporn, was not the author of the offending comments; she was just the Web master of the site that hosted them.

2012-05-18	Iran: Map Sets Off Dispute With Google	Incensed over what it views as a Western-Arab plot, Iran on Thursday threatened to sue Google for deleting the name Persian Gulf from its online mapping service and leaving the body of water nameless. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, was quoted by the state-run news media as saying that Iran had already warned Google of possible legal action and ''serious damages'' if the Persian Gulf was not identified as such. A spokeswoman for Google said that ''there's been some misunderstanding there's something new here'' and that ''labels have not been on this body of water for several years.'' The spokeswoman, who declined to be identified by name in accordance with Google's policy, said that she could not be sure precisely when the change had been made, but that ''we are constantly updating the maps and improving them.'' Iran is sensitive about the name of the body of water internationally identified as the Persian Gulf, which some Arab countries call the Arabian Gulf. Iran first raised the Google mapping issue two weeks ago, when its deputy minister for Islamic guidance, Bahman Dorri, said that the removal of the name was a ''mischievous act.''

2012-05-14	Popular Demand	There was a time, in mid-2000, when Google generated a paltry 1 percent of search. In the four-week period ending on April 28, Google had almost two-thirds of all search share, and together with Yahoo and Bing, accounted for 94 percent of all activity. Microsoft has spent years revamping its search business (it replaced Windows Live Search and MSN search with Bing in June 2009). Last week it announced a partnership with Facebook, to incorporate the ''likes'' and activities of a user's friends alongside search results on Bing. Any challenge is still a daunting task. Even if counting Bing and Yahoo together (since Bing powers Yahoo search) all Bing-related search accounts for slightly less than half of Google's share, with 30 percent.

2012-04-24	Technology Giants Take On Google in Patent Deal	SEATTLE - A plan by Facebook to acquire a broad range of patents through a deal with Microsoft is on its surface yet another twist in the battles over intellectual property engulfing the tech business. But the subtext of the deal is a different story, showing how two of technology's most powerful players are teaming up to create a greater balance of power on the Internet - a market that has been tilted decisively in favor of one company, Google, for years. ''This is almost certainly a move against Google,'' said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at Altimeter Group, a research firm. The agreement between Microsoft and Facebook, announced on Monday, came less than two weeks after Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 925 patents held by AOL. In a second deal, Microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents - about 650 in all - to Facebook for $550 million in cash, along with rights to 275 AOL patents Microsoft plans to retain. While Facebook and Microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents, it is expected that Facebook will end up with a range of patents involving mobile, Web and instant messaging technologies. Microsoft is likely to keep AOL patents involving search, among other things. The arrangement will help Facebook bulk up its intellectual property portfolio before its ini tial public offering, which is expected next month, and it is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company. ''This is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests over the long term,'' Ted Ullyot, general counsel of Facebook, said in a statement. The deal could also give Facebook additional ammunition in its escalating patent feud with Yahoo. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming violations of Yahoo patents, many related to online advertising. Facebook subsequently countersued Yahoo, in a pattern that is playing out again and again in different parts of the technology business, especially the mobile phone market. But in large part the deal is evidence of how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated ever closer to each other in part because of a common enemy, Google. Google has menaced Microsoft's business on a number of fronts, including with free online Google applications that compete with Microsoft Office and with Android, a mobile operating system that competes with Microsoft's Windows Phone software. As Facebook has evolved into a Web behemoth, with 900 million active monthly users, Google has become increasingly focused on tamping down the challenge to its business from the social network, introducing Google Plus, a rival social service. Google's big concern is that the bounty of data Facebook has about its users, including their tastes and friend connections, will turn it into a serious rival for online advertising dollars. There is also wide speculation that Facebook will start its own Internet search engine to rival Google. ''Microsoft is simply less concerned about the threat of social to its business than Google is,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, explaining why Microsoft is not concerned about competition with Facebook. ''This may be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' he added. Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, declined to comment. Microsoft has spent the last several years forging deeper connections with Facebook at every turn. Long stymied in its efforts to create an Internet search engine that effectively competed against Google, Microsoft two years ago struck a deal with Facebook to use data from the social network in Microsoft's Bing search engine to create more relevant search results. But the arrangement has not helped dislodge Google from its position of supremacy in Internet search. Years before that, Microsoft tried to acquire Facebook, but the social network's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, rebuffed the offer. Those conversations subsequently led to Microsoft's taking a small stake in Facebook, from which it stands to profit handsomely after the company goes public. In March, Google accounted for 66.4 percent of Internet searches in the United States, unchanged from the same month a year earlier, while Microsoft was in second place with 15.3 percent of the market, according to comScore. Microsoft's Bing search engine also supplies search results for Yahoo, which accounted for 13.7 percent of the search market during March. Microsoft has continued to lose money on Bing, including more than $2.6 billion in operating losses for its online division during its last fiscal year. Some executives within Microsoft have advocated selling Bing to another company, with the idea that a company better focused on the Internet market could pose a more credible challenge to Google, according to severalpeople with knowledge of the discussions who didn't want to be identified talking about internal deliberations.Over a year ago, Microsoft executives sent out feelers to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in acquiring Bing, though the overture was not officially sanctioned by Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, one of these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg declined, saying Facebook had too much else to concentrate on. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook. In its original patent deal with AOL, Microsoft either bought or won the ability to assign about 925 patents and patent applications, along with a license to several hundred other patents AOL did not sell as part of an auction of its intellectual property. If the deal announced Monday clears regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft would still own about 275 AOL patents and retain a license to the 650 patents that Facebook will own. In addition, Microsoft is granting Facebook a license to the 275 AOL patents that it is keeping. Yahoo's legal attack on Facebook came at a sensitive time, as the company nears an expected initial public offering. In a statement, Yahoo said the deal with Microsoft will not deter its lawsuit against Facebook. ''Nothing about today's action changes the fact that Facebook continues to infringe our patents,'' Yahoo said in the statement. ''Companies who purchase patents are often working from a position of weakness and take these actions to strengthen their portfolio. We see today's announcement as a validation of our case against Facebook.'' The deal with Facebook puts Microsoft in an awkward position since it could help strengthen one close partner at the expense of another, Yahoo. ''We are very sensitive to the importance of our relationship with both Facebook and Yahoo,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel said in an interview. ''We have enormous respect for the value of the Yahoo patent portfolio. Yahoo has been an important innovator in the Internet space.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2011-06-26	Stalking the Stalkers	On the corner of State and Camp, I came upon a Google Street View car at a stop sign. The driver was a young, husky guy with mirrored shades, a faint goatee and a phone pressed to the side of his head. The car was painted in bright colors with the Google logo, and jutting upward from the roof was a small tower on which sat a bright red ball that contained a camera. It looked like a giant penis with an eye. I was on my Vespa, and I pulled over. The car crossed State Street and headed up Camp, toward Audubon Park. California plates. I took out my iPhone, turned on the camera and pursued. The adrenaline that coursed through me contained a mixture of surprise, excitement and hostility. Cameras are ubiquitous in any city, especially in New Orleans -- there are the parents of little kids,always snapping away; the tourists framing this house, that tree; and the many movie sets, gargantuan operations set up like medieval encampments. Landlords talk excitedly about renting to ''movie people.''

For example, typing “sin 45 degrees” and hitting the Enter key brings a result of 0.707107 — with no digging around for a calculator. Microsoft has a full list of mathematical operations that work with Bing here; a similar list for Google is here.
2011-06-16	A Tool That Turns Gmail Into a Personal Assistant	I just learned (first from a friend, then from the many comments people posted on my previous post) that what I've been looking for from Gmail (reposting of received messages at a future date) actually exists in the form of Boomerang-a free Gmail plug-in that does exactly what I described. I just installed it and it works perfectly-messages can reappear in my inbox (marked as unread, starred and/or at the top of my inbox) at a date or time I set. Boomerang also lets you schedule delivery of e-mails you are sending. If you're working on something late at night and want it to appear in someone's inbox when they get to work, you can set your message to be sent at a specific date. This is also good for what I like to call V.O.P. (virtual-office presence), if you want to appear hard at work when you are otherwise sleeping or carousing.

2011-02-03	Google's Latitude Introduces Several New Features	Android users who upgrade to Google Maps 5.1, available since Tuesday, will find a bunch of new features added to Latitude, Google's location-based social network.

In the past, Latitude users could indicate where they were on a map, but the actual business or building they were in remained a mystery. (''I'm in Rockefeller Center'' is not terribly helpful. ''I'm in J. Crew'' is.) Since Latitude works with Google Maps and Android, it is constantly aware of your location (if you want it to be). That leads to the other enhancements: notification and automatic check-in and checkout. When you arrive somewhere, Latitude can prompt you to check in, in case you have forgotten to do so already. You can also set Latitude up to automatically check yourself in to frequently visited places, like your office. Latitude will also automatically check you out when you leave a location.

2010-12-09	Seven Pay-Per-Click Mistakes to Avoid	A few days ago, I described how a stay-at-home mom named Amy Gottesman built a six-figure party-entertainment business largely via the effective use of Google AdWords and other pay-per-click advertising services. These services allow a company to bid on certain keywords and phrases, and if the bid is high enough a short ad from the company will appear alongside the search results of anyone typing those words into a search engine and on some other Web sites. The business then pays the bid price -- it can be anywhere from pennies to more than a thousand dollars depending on the competition for those words -- every time someone clicks on the ad.
2010-12-09	An Online Strategy That Clicks	Six years ago, after leaving a high-powered career in fashion sales to become a stay-at-home mother of very young children, Amy Gottesman found herself missing her income -- and looking for something to do when her kids were napping. So Ms. Gottesman, who lives on Long Island, put up a Web site under the name of Smash Party Entertainment, offering entertainment for parties, ranging from casinos to living Roman ''statues'' to murder mysteries. And then she waited for the business to come in -- which it didn't, even though she was advertising in local newspapers and mailing out coupons. After three months of staring at the phone, she decided to try $20 worth of pay-per-click advertising through Google's AdWords service, which placed her short ads alongside the search results for certain keywords, as well as on some Web pages with content related to those keywords. ''In a few days,'' she said, ''the phone started ringing.''
2010-12-09	DEALBOOK ONLINE: GROUPON'S FUTURE	The 30-year-old chief executive of Groupon, Andrew Mason, is the newest member of tech's most exclusive club: entrepreneurs who walked away from multibillion-dollar takeover offers. On Friday, Mr. Mason rejected Google's $6 billion bid, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. The move quashed the search giant's hope of buying the fast-growing social buying site and put Groupon on track for an eventual public offering. Whether his gamble is a brilliant play or a Friendster fumble - the once promising social network that tumbled after snubbing an offer from Google - remains to be seen. For now, Mr. Mason, who is currently juggling television appearances and managing a recent spike in traffic, seems content with Groupon's trajectory. Mr. Mason spoke with DealBook on Wednesday about his company's prospects, the opportunities in the local advertising market, and why he likes dollhouses. Q.How was Friday? A.What happened on Friday? Haha Friday was a good day.

2009-04-17	Signs of Health Stirring in China & Google Barely Dented	China just reported that it has had the lowest quarterly increase in its economy since 1992. That's not good news -- but it's not as bad as it sounds. Certainly, the 6.1 percent rise still shames the rest of the world -- Singapore's economy has just shrunk twice as fast as China's grew. More important, there are signs that Premier Wen Jiabao's $585 billion stimulus is taking effect. The problem now isn't the efficacy of the medicine but the severity of the side effects. On their own, gross domestic product figures don't mean much. They reflect what was, not what will be, and in China their reliability is always questionable.
2009-04-17	Searching for Silicon Valley	WHILE on a bike ride in the hills behind Stanford University, I was helping a fellow cyclist fix a flat tire when a rental car full of lost Italian tourists pulled over. Clutching a map in his hands, the driver beseeched us, ''Can you tell us where we can go to see Silicon Valley?'' The cyclist, Tony Fadell, an Apple engineer who led the iPod and iPhone design teams, and I grinned at each other, but we had to sympathize with the driver's plight. Perhaps more than any region, Silicon Valley has transformed the world in the last half century. Yet exploring -- or even finding -- this patchwork quilt of high-tech research and development centers, factories and California suburbia can be baffling. That's because the valley is as much a state of mind as it is a physical place.

One study, published by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, examined the relationship between searches for influenza-related terms on the Yahoo search engine and the actual occurrence of influenza over a four-year period in the United States. The searches spiked one to three weeks in advance of a sharp rise in laboratory cultures testing positive for influenza and up to five weeks in advance of a rise in mortality due to influenza.

The University of California has 100 libraries on 10 campuses. The university system has already started digitizing some of its own collections, so Google's efforts will be complementary, said Adam Smith, group business product manager for Google Search. The University of California libraries join other Google library partners, including the University of Michigan, Harvard, Stanford, the New York Public Library, Oxford University and the Library of Congress. Google is not paying the University of California system for the right to scan its books. Mr. Smith said Google planned to make available the full texts of all public domain titles that it scans, but that for books still in copyright, it would provide only ''short snippets or bibliographic information.'' Google's plans have been the subject of controversy in the publishing industry, and the company has been sued by several publishers and authors who are challenging Google's right to scan books that are still under copyright. Mr. Smith said Google believed its use of small portions of the books was ''consistent with the fair use'' laws that permit the replication of copyrighted material. MOTOKO RICH"

2006-06-11	Scan This Book!	I chuckled as I read the letters (May 28) criticizing Kevin Kelly's article (May 14) on the coming revolution in distributing book content online. The critics are clearly bedfellows in print: writers, publishers a museum curator. The same kind of entrenched folks no doubt resisted the digital transformation of library card catalogs a few years ago. And long before that, blacksmiths and wagonmakers were similarly disposed against the railroaders. All disruptive technologies have their momentary detractors.

2006-06-04	Scan This Book!	I found it surprising that nowhere in the discussion of a digitized universal library was there mention of Jorge Luis Borges's ''Library of Babel.'' In 1941, Borges posited the existence of an endless library (otherwise known as the universe) that was made up of infinite hexagonal galleries of books, containing everything ever written, including all that has ever been conceived of having been written. While Borges feared the human species might be on the verge of extinction, he did believe that ''the Library -- enlightened, solitary, infinite, perfectly unmoving, armed with precious volumes, pointless, incorruptible, and secret -- will endure.'' Robby Ameen New York
2006-06-04	Scan This Book!	After reading Kevin Kelly's article, I felt the need to go and look at my book collection, most of which I inherited from my mother. I handled each book gently, since they are all now quite frail. My mother's books are more than personal mementos. They are a reminder that some things cannot, and should not, be replaced. I use the Internet all the time and I think it's fantastic -- for research, not for reading. I mean really reading. A book may look ''inert,'' but there's nothing inert about what happens when I shut off the PC and the TV, and begin to read. There is an intimacy to holding this special possession in my hands that I cannot experience by looking at a plastic screen inside a metal box. I applaud the dazzling advances in research that the Internet has brought and will continue to bring. And yet I will, at the end of every day, curl up with a good book, not a good computer. Clare Higgins Gloucester, Mass.
2006-06-04	Scan This Book!	The ability to decompose and rearrange narrativetexts may be useful in ''sound-bite scholarship'' and intellectual scrapbooking. But the digital noise created by all the communal editing and footnoting may drown out any thoughtful conversation between reader and author.A library of self-contained texts, immune from indiscriminate tampering, has been, is and will continue to be our best hope for moral, ethical and intellectual evolution.

2006-06-04	Scan This Book!	The option to see all the information connected to a main idea or source might actually discourage creative thinking and might produce lazy scholars (Kevin Kelly, May 14). Those searching for information may not be inspired to draw parallels between obscure ideas or topics, and may be less inclined to make their own judgments about original material. The answers will become too available, and as a result, the educational journey of research may become obsolete. Randi Brown New York

2006-05-28	Scan This Book!	The fact that Google is mentioned no fewer than 53 times in Kevin Kelly's article is a bit of a giveaway where his loyalties lie. Forgive us if we're less than enthusiastic! There is no question that Google has created an amazing search engine. There is also no question that without exciting, interesting, well-researched and well-written information, Google would have nothing to search. We do well to remember that Microsoft, Yahoo and others in the Open Content Alliance are also in the business of connecting words and ideas -- the difference is that they first obtain permission to copy works under copyright. (The problem of ''orphan'' copyrighted works, whose owners can't be identified or located, is currently being looked at by Congress, where responsive legislation is being drafted.) No one at the Association of American Publishers or the Authors Guild was quoted in the piece. Our two lawsuits challenging Google's right to take millions of our books, make complete digital copies and store them on their computers to promote their search engine and generate ad revenues were dismissed as the last hurrahs of an ancient order of mastodons who refuse to stand aside as the Google technological juggernaut rolls on. Google is a $100 billion, profit-making, publicly held corporation, with the interests of stockholders and partners to serve. Pat Schroeder President and C.E.O.

2006-05-07	Google's China Problem (And China's Google Problem)	Of all the stories I've read about China and Internet censorship -- and there have been a bunch -- Clive Thompson's article (April 23) was the first to show a more nuanced and interesting picture. As a First Amendment near-absolutist, I had found it easy to label Google as craven and hypocritical, until I learned more about what it actually has done and why. That doesn't cleanse Google in my eyes, but it certainly turns caricatures into fully animated characters. Mark Obbie Canandaigua, N.Y.
2006-05-07	Google's China Problem (And China's Google Problem)	I had thought that everything had been said that could be said about Google's China problem, but Thompson's article helped me see something new. In the Google Bildungsroman, the chronicle of its extraordinary growth and development to magnificent maturity, it appears that Google's moral imagination has been left behind in grade school. Think of the devastating list of things that it would have been '' 'arrogant' of Google to try to change'' -- apartheid, death camps, the gulag, Mao's killing machine. Donald Heinz Chico, Calif.
2006-05-07	Google's China Problem (And China's Google Problem)	For many years, the United States government's Voice of America and the BBC's World Service tried to penetrate China's antitruth fire wall with radio broadcasts that could skip into the country from transmitters outside the country. Chinese government transmitters tried to jam these radio broadcasts, and the same is happening today, in the digital world, via China-based Cisco routers that block the truth. Thus we know that digital transmissions are every bit as susceptible to censorship as over-the-air radio, television and satellite transmissions are. Patrick Jackson Chapel Hill, N.C.

2006-04-10	Some Worries as San Francisco Goes Wireless	When Mayor Gavin Newsom announced 18 months ago that he intended to provide free wireless access to all of the city's 760,000 residents, Chris Vein said he felt sorry for the ''poor guy'' who would have to carry out the complex task. Today, nine months after taking the job as head of the city's technology department, Mr. Vein is the point person in negotiations over the details. Last week, the city announced it had selected Google and EarthLink to build the wireless network, which it hopes will be in operation early next year. The two companies, along with Tropos Networks and Motorola, which will help build the infrastructure for the network, beat out five other bidding teams in a six-week review process.
2006-04-09	This Boring Headline Is Written for Google	JOURNALISTS over the years have assumed they were writing their headlines and articles for two audiences -- fickle readers and nitpicking editors. Today, there is a third important arbiter of their work: the software programs that scour the Web, analyzing and ranking online news articles on behalf of Internet search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN. The search-engine ''bots'' that crawl the Web are increasingly influential, delivering 30 percent or more of the traffic on some newspaper, magazine or television news Web sites. And traffic means readers and advertisers, at a time when the mainstream media is desperately trying to make a living on the Web.

TheMLSonline.com, a listings service, bought several keywords on Google and Yahoo, including ''Edina Realty.'' That did not sit well with a company called -- you guessed it -- Edina Realty.

2006-04-02	Does the Internet Make Us Dumber?	To the Editor: Google is just another tool in a long line of search tools, neither angel nor devil.

To the Editor: Re ''Searching for Dummies'' (Op-Ed, March 26): As a librarian who has guided college students through the research process for more than 25 years, I would suggest that Edward Tenner misses the mark when he questions search engines, such as Google, for ''making today's students dumber.''
2006-03-31	More Subpoenas in Suit Over Obscenity Law	Both the Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union confirmed yesterday that they had requested and received information from Internet service providers and software makers in connection with an A.C.L.U. lawsuit challenging an anti-pornography law. Earlier this year it was revealed that the Justice Department, which is defending the law, had subpoenaed information from four search engine companies about keyword requests by users. Google challenged its subpoena. This month a judge ordered the company to provide some information to the Justice Department but not information on individual searches, saying that had the potential to violate the privacy of users.

Its sprawling growth, fueled by a public stock offering in August 2004 that created a market behemoth, has now thrust it into the glare of Washington."
2006-03-26	Searching for Dummies	TALK of decline was old news in academia even in 1898, when traditionalists blasted Harvard for ending its Greek entrance requirement. But today there's a new twist in the story: Are search engines making today's students dumber? In December, the National Center for Education Statistics published a report on adult literacy revealing that the number of college graduates able to interpret complex texts proficiently had dropped since 1992 from 40 percent to 31 percent. As Mark S. Schneider, the center's commissioner of education statistics, put it, ''What's disturbing is that the assessment is not designed to test your understanding of Proust, but to test your ability to read labels.''
2006-03-25	Google Finance: A Portal Play?	REACTION has been mixed, but mostly positive, to Google Finance, which went live this week. Despite a few bugs, most Google watchers seem to like the service's features, which include news items keyed to stock charts; recent company-specific blog posts; and pop-up information on corporate officers. What has commentators talking the most, though, is what it means for Google, which has prided itself on a minimalist approach and an emphasis on directing users to content rather than providing it.
2006-03-21	Google Offers Search Service On Finance	Harnessing yet another data category to its search-engine prowess, Google is introducing a financial information service intended to compete directly with offerings from Microsoft, Yahoo and other sources, Google executives said Monday. Google said the service, at finance.google.com, would distinguish itself by providing stock charts with interactive qualities like those on its Google Maps service, allowing users to find deeper or specified layers of data by sliding the cursor.
2006-03-18	Google Ordered to Submit Data For Child Pornography Study	As expected, a federal judge ruled on Friday that Google, the Internet search engine, must turn over some search data including 50,000 Web addresses to the government for a study of child pornography online. But the judge, James Ware of the Federal District Court for Northern California, denied a government request that Google be ordered to hand over keywords that customers use to search its database.
2006-03-15	U.S. Limits Demands On Google	After the Justice Department drastically reduced its request for information from Google, a federal judge said on Tuesday that he intended to approve at least part of that request. The government first subpoenaed Web data from Google last August, as part of its defense of an online pornography law.
2006-03-13	Arts	" Briefly; Google's Book Deal"",""Google is about two months away from offering consumers the ability to buy the full text of books online from publishers who participate in its Book Search program, the company said on Friday. Last week it began seeking publishers in the United States and Britain that would be willing to sell permanent online access to books through the Book Search site (books.google.com). Jim Gerber, Google's director of content partnerships, said the program was part of a ''suite of tools'' that the company was planning to ''generate more book revenues'' for publishers and for Google. The publishers would set the price for the digital access and decide which of their books to include in the program and whether to allow consumers to print a copy of the purchased book.

2006-03-12	Much for the Few	ANDY STEWARD, a successful London computer consultant and sailboat racer, became exasperated when trying to watch his favorite sport on television. There were a few half-hour recaps of some major sailing races, but they were always shown late at night. Mr. Steward looked into creating a sailing channel on the Sky satellite service in Britain, but his idea was soon dead in the water. He would have had to pay £85,000 (nearly $150,000) to start the channel and £40,000 a month (nearly $70,000), as well as the production costs. That was a lot of money for an untested concept.
2006-03-10	Google Acquisition Signals New Rivalry	Google Inc. said yesterday that it had bought the Silicon Valley start-up Upstartle, gaining its Writely Internet word processing software. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Writely lets users compose documents on the Web and share them with others, according to notes on Google's Web site yesterday. Upstartle released a test version of Writely software last August.

Carriers like Sprint and Verizon charge more than $1 and sometimes as much as $2 a call from a cellphone.. And much of that is profit. Directory assistance ''truly is a cash cow,'' said Saroja Girishankar, a vice president at the Pelorus Group, a telecommunications market research firm based in Raritan, N.J. She and other industry analysts said that the carriers paid wholesalers -- who actually provide the 411 service -- from 25 to 50 cents a call.
2006-03-07	Theme of London Book Fair Is What Technology Can Do	If this year's London Book Fair had a theme, it would be technology. The most popular event on Sunday, the opening day, was a lecture by John L. Needham of Google, about that Internet company's Book Search program. The lecture hall was full to capacity 15 minutes before the scheduled start time, and many who could not fit into the session lingered by the door, hoping to slip in if anyone left early. And though Mr. Needham, not surprisingly, extolled the marketing power of the search tool, the issue of the meaning of copyright in the e-publishing age was clearly on attendees' minds here at the fair, which ends on Tuesday.

2006-03-03	Google TriesTo Reassure Wall Street	Google shares may have fallen toward earth in recent weeks, but its executives still think that the sky's the limit for the company's growth opportunities. With the share price down 20 percent from its high this year and investors increasingly skittish, Google offered a detailed and sober appraisal yesterday of its finances and strategy, a presentation meant to reassure investors that as a rapidly growing company, it still saw boundless opportunities to expand its Internet services and advertising network.
2006-03-03	Pick-Your-Price Public Offerings	If the question of the moment is, ''What did we do before Google?'' at W. R.

Hambrecht, the system-bucking champion of using auctions to sell initial public offerings of stock, has developed a following among entrepreneurs since Google went public in an auction 18 months ago. Using a method it calls OpenIPO, Hambrecht has auctioned off shares in two companies already this year, after taking five public that way in 2005.
2006-03-02	Senate Bill to Address Fears of Blocked Access to Net	Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, will introduce new legislation today that would prohibit Internet network operators from charging companies for faster delivery of their content to consumers or favoring some content providers over others. The bill is meant to ease growing fears that open Internet access may be blocked or compromised by the Bell phone carriers and cable operators, which may create tiers of service for delivering content to consumers, much the way the post office charges more for overnight mail delivery than for regular delivery.
2006-03-01	Publicis Acts to Surf the Marketing Waves of the Future	AS Google ventures deeper into the mainstream areas of media and advertising, many of the reigning powers there are watching with a mixture of fascination and fear.

And in one of the first marketing efforts to use Google's map technology, HBO would like to show you exactly where those are. To promote their upcoming season of ''The Sopranos,'' HBO, a division of Time Warner, and Deep Focus, an online marketing agency, have created an interactive map of New Jersey, using satellite maps from Google, and have highlighted important points of the most recent season's storyline. The map has about 15 icons in specific areas where scenes took place. When the user clicks on an icon, the scene plays in a pop-up window, which also supplies a description and a list of characters.
2006-02-16	Web Firms Questioned On Dealings In China	Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Cisco Systems came under fire at a House human rights hearing on Wednesday for what a subcommittee chairman called a ''sickening collaboration'' with the Chinese government that was ''decapitating the voice of the dissidents'' there. The statements by the chairman, Representative Christopher Smith, Republican of New Jersey, opened a much-anticipated session aimed at getting an accounting of the companies' dealings in China, and to air criticism that they do business there at the peril of human rights.

The official, Liu Zhengrong, who supervises Internet affairs for the information office of China's State Council, or cabinet, did not directly dispute the contention of many critics that China operates a vast and technologically sophisticated firewall to protect the ruling Communist Party against what it views as Web-based threats to its authority.

2006-02-09	Despite Web Crackdown	" Prevailing Winds Are Free"",""For months now, the news about the news in China has been awful. Carrying out its vow to tighten controls over what it calls ''propaganda,'' the government of President Hu Jintao has busied itself closing publications, firing editorial staffs and jailing reporters. More noticeably, the government has clamped down on the Internet, closing blogger sites, filtering Web sites and e-mail messages for banned words and tightening controls on text messages. Last year, Yahoo was criticized for revealing the identity of an Internet journalist, Shi Tao, who was subsequently jailed. [On Wednesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists said court documents posted on a Chinese Web site showed that Yahoo had done the same in 2003, resulting in the jailing of another writer, Li Zhi.]"
2006-02-07	New Google Service to Blend The Gmail and Chat Features	Google, the search-engine giant, is expected on Tuesday to disclose that it will join its instant-messaging service with its popular Gmail program, the latest indication that the company has set its sights on the broader communications industry. The new program, called Gmail Chat, will let Gmail users exchange text messages with others without having to log onto a separate chat program, making instant messaging simpler and more integrated with the e-mail program.
2006-02-07	Google Imposes a Ban on BMW Web Site	Google has removed the German Web site of BMW from its Internet search index, saying that the company was redirecting users from requested information to another page selling luxury cars. Pages on the Web site, BMW.de, included hidden software that moved visitors from a page that Google had found to another page with flashier graphics.
2006-02-06	Venture for Sharing Wi-Fi Draws Big-Name Backers	A telecommunications executive said on Sunday that he had received $21.7 million for what he called ''a global network of shared Wi-Fi connections'' from backers, including Google, the Internet phone service provider Skype, and the venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures. The network is being created by a software venture called Fon, which was started by Martin Varsavsky in Madrid three months ago. The service permits subscribers to modify their own routers so that users of Wi-Fi wireless technology can connect to the Internet at many physical locations, in contrast to the limited range of access that is often available now.

2006-02-04	Online Trail Can Lead To Court	Who is sending threatening e-mail to a teenager? Who is saying disparaging things about a company on an Internet message board? Who is communicating online with a suspected drug dealer? These questions, and many more like them, are asked every day of the companies that provide Internet service and run Web sites. And even though these companies promise to protect the privacy of their users, they routinely hand over the most intimate information in response to legal demands from criminal investigators and lawyers fighting civil cases.
2006-02-01	Big Results At Google Fall Short	After astounding Wall Street with its incredible growth, Google yesterday learned the perils of high expectations. An earnings increase that fell shy of investors' hopes sent its shares plummeting. Google's stock fell almost 20 percent immediately after the announcement, made after the close of regular trading, then recovered somewhat. By evening it was down about 12 percent from yesterday's close, trading around $379.
2006-01-29	How to Outwit the World's Internet Censors	When Google announced last week that it would censor its new search service in China, the company became, to many, the latest component in that country's sophisticated system of information control. With strategies ranging from automated keyword filtering and Web site blocking to Internet traffic surveillance, the Chinese government is unmatched in its ability to censor and monitor its citizens online.

The move, which Google is fighting, has alarmed its users, enraged privacy advocates, changed some people's Internet search habits and set off a debate about how much privacy one can expect on the Web. But the case itself, according to people involved in it and scholars who are following it, has almost nothing to do with privacy. It will turn, instead, on serious but relatively routine questions about trade secrets and civil procedure."
2006-01-25	New Program Takes Aim at Purveyors of Malicious Software	In an effort to stamp out what has become an epidemic of spyware, unwanted adware and other malicious software plaguing millions of computers and costing consumers billions of dollars each year, Internet research centers at Harvard Law School and Oxford University plan today to unveil a program aimed at outing the shady companies that produce them. The project has received initial financing ''in the seven figures'' from several leading technology companies, including Google, Lenovo, and Sun Microsystems, according to John G. Palfrey Jr., the executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.
2006-01-25	Version of Google in China Won't Offer E-Mail or Blogs	Google is bringing a special version of its powerful search engine to China, leaving behind two of its most popular features in the United States. In an effort to cope with China's increasingly pervasive Internet controls, Google said Tuesday that it would introduce a search engine here this week that excludes e-mail messaging and the ability to create blogs.

Following its release after about five years in the halfway house for overblown business ideas, it has been swiftly rehabilitated in the form of various online-offline business ventures. This time around, though, some fairly radical wrinkles on the theme are in the works. One notable example is Google's deal last week to acquire dMarc Broadcasting for up to $1.24 billion."
2006-01-21	Fishing in Cyberspace	Enough is never enough, not when the government believes that it can invade your privacy without repercussions. The Justice Department wants a federal judge to force Google to turn over millions of private Internet searches. Google is rightly fighting the demand, but the government says America Online, Yahoo and MSN, Microsoft's online service, have already complied with similar requests. This is not about national security. The Justice Department is making this baldfaced grab to try to prop up an online pornography law that has been blocked once by the Supreme Court. And it's not the first time we've seen this sort of behavior. The government has zealously protected the Patriot Act's power to examine library records. It sought the private medical histories of a selected group of women, saying it needed the information to defend the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the federal courts.
2006-01-20	Google Resists U.S. Subpoena Of Search Data	The Justice Department has asked a federal judge to compel Google, the Internet search giant, to turn over records on millions of its users' search queries as part of the government's effort to uphold an online pornography law. Google has been refusing the request since a subpoena was first issued last August, even as three of its competitors agreed to provide information, according to court documents made public this week. Google asserts that the request is unnecessary, overly broad, would be onerous to comply with, would jeopardize its trade secrets and could expose identifying information about its users.

CD, then DVD. Music iPod, then video iPod. And then, of course, there's Apple's iTunes Music Store. The day it began selling videos, too, was the first time that cowering TV executives ever climbed down off of their kitchen tables and allowed somebody to use ''TV show'' and ''Internet'' in the same sentence. It was a small, timid test -- only five TV series from one network at first, only in the United States, at low resolution and with copy protection -- but it was a spectacular success. TV fans bought about eight million videos in the first three months of the service.
2006-01-18	Google to Buy Radio Advertising Sales Unit	Google said yesterday that it would spend up to $1.24 billion to buy dMarc Broadcasting, whose software can allow marketers to send advertisements directly to local radio stations. It is the most tangible indication yet of Google's stated ambition to extend its Web-based network, which sells advertisements on thousands of online sites, to other forms of media as well.
2006-01-16	Google's Shadow Payroll Is Not Such a Secret Anymore	FEELING depressed because you missed out on Google's stock bonanza? Not to worry. Just get on the company's shadow payroll. Hundreds of thousands of people have essentially done just that by starting blogs, forums or other informational sites and getting paid for posting ads on Google's behalf. And while the money they earn might not be enough for them to buy, say, a share of Google's stock, such revenues are growing.

The 2.9-million-square-foot building is the second-largest in Manhattan in terms of area, behind 55 Water Street, according to the CoStar Group, the commercial real estate information services company, straddling an entire block reaching to Ninth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets. In its earliest days, the building was primarily a huge distribution center for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey."
2006-01-08	Is Google a Good Candidate For Rational Exuberance?	IS the dot-com bubble reinflating? Last week, a relatively obscure Wall Street analyst named Safa Rashtchy, from Piper Jaffray, became an overnight sensation among the Internet faithful. He predicted that Google's stock price, which has climbed more than 350 percent since its initial public offering in 2004, and was $422.52 at the time, would hit $600 a share by the end of 2006.
2006-01-06	Google and Yahoo Aim at Another Screen	Two ascending Internet giants, Google and Yahoo, are to make plain today that they intend to move aggressively beyond the Internet browser and onto the television screen. The two companies, already the most popular services for searching and organizing the vast information on the World Wide Web, want to perform the same function for television, which will increasingly be delivered over the Internet.
2005-12-31	Suit Accuses Google of Infringing Patents	Google, the Internet search engine, has been accused in a lawsuit of infringing a patent-licensing company's patents with its free Internet telephone system. The plaintiff, Rates Technology, contends that Google Talk, a voice-over-Internet service, infringes patents issued in 1995 and 1996. One is for a device for routing telephone calls along ''a least-cost route,'' and the other is for a system to update a database that stores billing rates so cheaper calls can be made.
2005-12-27	Corrections	A front-page article last Tuesday about foreign governments' security concerns regarding satellite photography available through Google referred imprecisely to security measures applied to some of the imagery.

But wouldn't he have a little more credibility if he could just bring himself to say he was sorry? After all, it was Mr. Case, along with Gerald M. Levin, the former Time Warner chief executive, who put together what soon became the merger from hell.
2005-12-24	Google Will Have the Right to Sell Its 5% Stake in AOL by 2008	Google will have the right to sell its new 5 percent stake in America Online as soon as July 1, 2008, according to regulatory filings yesterday by both Google and Time Warner, AOL's parent. On Tuesday, the companies announced that Google would buy the stake in AOL for $1 billion, saying the move represented a vote of confidence in AOL's plans to transform itself from a shrinking provider of dial-up Internet access into a series of advertising-supported Web sites.
2005-12-21	Under Terms of Partnership	" AOL and Google Agree to Shared Selling of Ads"",""America Online formally announced a revived partnership with Google yesterday, a deal that affirmed AOL's value less than a year after a chorus of calls for its parent, Time Warner, to shedthe division as a lost cause. Google said it had agreed to buy 5 percent of AOL for $1 billion and to provide advertising credits for AOL to promote its Web sites on Google's search service. Those advertising credits total $300 million over the five-year term of the deal, according to an executive involved in the negotiations."

2005-12-20	AOL Coaxes Google to Try Busier Ads	Users of Google's search engine will soon see something they are not used to on the notoriously spare site: advertising with logos and graphics. And the advertisers will not be limited to America Online, whose talks with Google prompted the change in policy, according to two executives close to the companies' negotiations. As part of their deal, which is expected to be formally announced this afternoon, Google is providing AOL with $300 million worth of advertising on Google's Web sites, intended to use to draw Google search users to related content on AOL's sites, the executives said. That sum is on top of the $1 billion in cash that Google is to invest to buy a 5 percent stake in AOL.

But since its debut last summer, Google Earth has received attention of an unexpected sort. Officials of several nations have expressed alarm over its detailed display of government buildings, military installations and other important sites within their borders."
2005-12-19	The Advertising Column; AOL Choice Of Google Leaves Gates The Outsider	This time, it was Microsoft that was snubbed at the last minute.

A day later, the nonbinding agreement was shunted aside when AOL announced that it had instead chosen Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser in a $100 million deal.

2005-12-17	Time Warner to Sell 5% AOL Stake to Google for $1 Billion	Rebuffing aggressive overtures from Microsoft, Time Warner has agreed to sell a 5 percent stake in America Online to Google for $1 billion in cash as part of an expanded partnership between AOL, once the dominant company on the Internet, and Google, the current online king. At stake in this battle was leadership in Internet advertising, which is a growing threat to other media companies. The loss is a blow to Microsoft, which had sought AOL as a partner in its advertising venture to undercut Google, its potent rival.
2005-12-13	HarperCollins Will Create A Searchable Digital Library	In the latest move in the battle between publishers and search engines, HarperCollins Publishers said yesterday it would create its own digital library of all of its book and audio content and make it searchable by consumers on the Internet. Web users will be able to search the HarperCollins archive via search engines like Google and Yahoo or the specialized programs of retailers like Amazon.com. The move is intended to allow HarperCollins, a unit of the News Corporation, to maintain control over digital content rather than cede that control to other companies, Jane Friedman, chief executive, said.

2005-12-11	Can This Man Reprogram Microsoft?	THINK back to Round 1 of the Internet, when things really got rolling in 1995. The computing landscape was shifting, and a cool, fast-growing young company symbolized the new order: Netscape. At the time, Microsoft looked to be a lumbering old war horse, trapped in the yesteryear of desktop personal computer software, word processors, spreadsheets and operating systems. It seemed, in other words, so 1980's. But, of course, Microsoft emerged a winner. It embraced the Internet and vanquished the Netscape threat with hard work, ingenuity and strong-arm tactics that a federal court ruled violated the nation's antitrust laws. Microsoft's shares soared to a record high at the end of 1999.

2005-11-28	What Google Should Roll Out Next: A Privacy Upgrade	At a North Carolina strangulation-murder trial this month, prosecutors announced an unusual piece of evidence: Google searches allegedly done by the defendant that included the words ''neck'' and ''snap.'' The data were taken from the defendant's computer, prosecutors say. But it might have come directly from Google, which -- unbeknownst to many users -- keeps records of every search on its site, in ways that can be traced back to individuals. Google is rolling out revolutionary new features at a blistering rate, most recently Google Base, which could evolve into a classified ad service, and the Google Book Search Library Project, which aims to put a vast number of books online. Google's stock recently soared past $400 a share, putting its market capitalization ahead of Time Warner and Gannett combined, and the personal fortunes of its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, above $14 billion.
2005-11-26	Big Google Becomes Big Target	IN 2001, about a dozen of Google's founding employees sat in a conference room trying to come up with a set of corporate values. After a while, one of them, an engineer, Paul Buchheit, said everything they were saying could be summed up by a simple phrase: ''Don't Be Evil.'' The phrase stuck, and it became Google's informal motto. Creating one is easy, of course. Living up to it is a little harder, especially when your company becomes as large and ubiquitous as Google. For most of its short history, all was well, but recently complaints have piled up, reaching a peak this month as Google unveiled yet more products. Long considered the David to Microsoft's Goliath, Google is increasingly being thought of as a Goliath itself.
2005-11-22	Google Gift to Digital Library	The Library of Congress will announce today a $3 million gift from Google to help the library begin building a World Digital Library, a project that aims to digitize and place on the Web significant primary materials from national libraries and other institutions worldwide. James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, said the World Digital Library would be modeled after the library's American Memory Project, started in 1994, which has been digitizing and placing on the Web millions of items, including manuscripts of Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, the Gettysburg Address and Civil War photographs.

Vise and Mark Malseed (Delacorte Press, $26), is as adoring a business profile as I have read, there are occasional hints that the extraordinary success of this search-engine phenom has begun to go to its head -- and maybe even produced a touch of the arrogance for which past software kings have been famous. There is Google's cavalier effort, without regard to people's privacy, to sell ads based on the content of people's e-mail. Then we read that Google is reluctant to make restitution to advertisers who claim to have been victimized by fraudulent and often malicious clickers. Next comes the unsettling point that Google refers to ads on its own site with the euphemism ''sponsored links.''"

The most brazen advertiser of all, hands down, was X10, a little company hawking security cameras, whose ubiquitous ''pop under'' ads were the nasty surprise discovered only when you closed a browser window in preparation for doing something else. Today, Web advertisers by and large have put down their weapons and sworn off violence. They use indoor voices now. This is a remarkable change."

2005-11-18	Rapid Rise: Google Passes $400 a Share	Google became a verb before it became a public company. Now it has also become a $400 stock. Just 15 months after the company went public in an unusual auction at $85 a share, which was less than the company had hoped and was widely viewed as disappointing, Google traded yesterday above $400 for the first time, closing at $403.45, up $5.30. The gain helped lift the Nasdaq composite index, which rose 1.5 percent, to 2,220.46, to its highest close since June 2001.
2005-11-18	Building a Better Boom	IT sure feels like a bubble, doesn't it? Let's tick off the signs: a red-hot market for Internet stocks (Google, for example, has more than quadrupled since it went public in 2004); fawning articles celebrating entrepreneurs; a glut of venture capitalists elbowing one another to invest in companies with no plans on how to make money past some hand waving about ''advertising'' and plenty of vague claims about how their technology will ''change the world.'' The Internet is exciting again, and once again folks are rushing in. In some categories -- like search or social networking, for example -- there are scores of start-ups vying for pretty much the same market, and it's certain that, just like last time, most of them will fail.

Why, Defoe asked -- at a time when authors had no rights to their own work -- should there be laws against one class of villain, and not against those who steal another kind of property created ''after infinite Labour, Study, and Expence''?"
2005-11-09	Corrections	An article in the Circuits pages of Business Day on Oct. 20 about new uses for Google maps referred incorrectly to an issue in discussions between Google and Trulia.com, a company developing a real estate research site using those maps. While the two companies are indeed negotiating a contract, revenue sharing is not part of the discussion.
2005-11-09	Corrections	A front-page article on Sunday about the competitive threat that businesses perceive from Google misstated the title of Bill Gates at Microsoft, a company that is trying to overtake Google's Internet search offerings. He is chairman, not chief executive.

But despite a flurry of interest in AOL from Microsoft, Google and others, finding a deal has been harder than Time Warner may have hoped. Behind the scenes, a number of questions remain that could hold up or even derail a potential transaction."
2005-11-07	The Online Travel Landscape Is Getting Crowded	TRAVEL sites like Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz already have their hands full with airlines and hoteliers -- their ''valued partners'' -- luring consumers away with sites that look more like full-service travel agencies every day. Now, here come Yahoo and AOL, and maybe even Google. AOL, Yahoo and others have intensified their focus on the travel category in the past year, beefing up destination features, introducing tools and scooping up new users and marketers in the process. This trend has the online travel agencies bracing for the possibility that the portals could one day evolve into full-fledged competitors.
2005-11-06	Just Googling It Is Striking Fear Into Companies	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, often intimidates its competitors and suppliers. Makers of goods from diapers to DVD's must cater to its whims. But there is one company that even Wal-Mart eyes warily these days: Google, a seven-year-old business in a seemingly distant industry. ''We watch Google very closely at Wal-Mart,'' said Jim Breyer, a member of Wal-Mart's board.
2005-11-04	Want 'War and Peace' Online? How About 20 Pages at a Time?	In a race to become the iTunes of the publishing world, Amazon.com and Google are both developing systems to allow consumers to purchase online access to any page, section or chapter of a book. These programs would combine their already available systems of searching books online with a commercial component that could revolutionize the way that people read books. The idea is to do for books what Apple has done for music, allowing readers to buy and download parts of individual books for their own use through their computers rather than trek to a store or receive them by mail. Consumers could purchase a single recipe from a cookbook, for example, or a chapter on rebuilding a car engine from a repair manual.
2005-11-03	Big Media a Tough Sell to Jittery Investors	The media moguls are busier than ever. In the last few months, Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman, has announced a series of Web deals including the purchase of Myspace.com, a social networking site. Time Warner is in talks to sell a stake in a suddenly hot AOL. Walt Disney, meanwhile, agreed to shake up its business model and distribute some of its television shows on the latest Apple iPod. Viacom is splitting itself in two. And Comcast announced a deal with Time Warner and other cable operators yesterday to add Sprint cellular service to its range of video, voice and high-speed Internet services.
2005-11-03	Google Adds Library Texts to Search Database	Google said yesterday that it had completed the first major expansion of its Google Print database of searchable books, adding the full text of more than 10,000 works that are no longer under copyright, culled from the collections of four major research libraries. The additions, from the university libraries at Michigan, Harvard and Stanford and from the New York Public Library, represent the first large group of material to be made available electronically from those libraries, which along with Oxford University contracted with Google last year to let the company scan and make searchable the contents of much or all of their collections.

The new online initiatives will deliver services to businesses and consumers directly via the Web, in many cases, without the need to download the applications to a computer. As such, they are an important step in extending Microsoft's reach beyond the desktop PC to smart phones and other Internet-connected devices."
2005-10-31	Newspaper Ad Circulars Find Their Way Online	YOU could argue that reading a newspaper online is much like reading one offline, but one thing is unmistakably missing from the Web: when you log on, an advertising circular does not fall into your lap. Until now, that is. Gannett, one of the nation's biggest newspaper publishers, said it would introduce a new service on its newspaper Web sites next month that displays banner ads that readers can expand into a virtual version of the weekly local circulars so familiar to offline newspaper readers.
2005-10-30	Your Ads Here (All of Them)	IN many ways, Larry Page and Sergey Brin seem an unlikely pair to lead an advertising revolution. As Stanford graduate students sketching out the idea that became Google, the two software engineers sniffed in an academic paper that ''advertising-funded search engines will inherently be biased toward the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers.'' They softened that line a bit by the time they got around to pitching their business to venture capitalists, allowing that selling ads would be a handy safety net if their other, less distasteful ideas for generating revenue didn't pan out.

She started making podcasts -- recorded audio programs that people can download from the Internet and hear on their computers or MP3 players. From her home near Vancouver, British Columbia, she spoke about her devastating disease into a microphone, connected to her computer, and then posted her thoughts on the Internet. Since then, thousands of people have listened to that first podcast and many others she has made about her disease and related issues, and she now interviews others as part of her program. ''There's no reason I have the disease, and no cure for it,'' she said. ''As it turned out, that situation spoke to a large community of people.''"

But after a while, you might want to explore the higher applications of Google Earth -- for example, browsing modern and contemporary architecture. Pointingit (0lll.com/pointingit) started last month with the sole purpose of linking Google Earth (which only Windows users can download at earth.google.com) to 0lll.com (that's a zero and three L's), a Web site that compiles everyday, not-always-glamorous photographs of architecture."
2005-10-26	Google Found To Be Testing Classified Ads	An online classified service being tested by Google set off intense speculation on Tuesday after a Web site for the service was accidentally made public and discovered by a computer programmer on Monday.

2005-10-20	A Journey to a Thousand Maps Begins With an Open Code	A Google map is no longer just a Google map. You can still search Google Maps to figure out how to get from here to there, but why would you, when you can use it to pinpoint kosher restaurants in Cincinnati, traffic cameras in Dublin, or hot spring spas anywhere in the United States? How about finding coffee shops in Seattle that provide free wireless Internet access? Or would you prefer to locate the McMansion your boss just bought and find how out exactly how much he paid for it?
2005-10-20	Arts	" Briefly; Major Publishers Sue Google"",""Five large American publishing companies filed a lawsuit against Google yesterday, charging that the company's Google Print for Libraries program -- which plans to make searchable, digital copies of nearly all the books in five major research libraries -- violates the rights of the publishers under the federal Copyright Act. McGraw-Hill, Pearson Education, Penguin Group, Simon & Schuster and John Wiley & Sons filed a joint lawsuit in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeking a declaration that the Google Print for Libraries program violates copyright and requesting an injunction against the scanning of printed works without the permission of the copyright holder. The lawsuit is similar to one filed last month by three authors whose works are included in the University of Michigan library, one of the libraries whose collections Google plans to digitize. By filing a similar suit, the publishers put considerably more muscle behind the action against Google. Google has maintained that its program is covered by the fair use provision of copyright law and that it therefore does not need permission of the copyright holders for the library project. The program makes only small portions of a copyrighted text available to users online; Google likens the result to an electronic card catalog. EDWARD WYATT"

The Google Print sites -- for France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Spain -- enable users to search books provided by publishers in each country as well as English-language books in the Google library for which the company has secured local rights."
2005-10-13	Big Hitters Said to Want Piece of AOL	Google and Comcast are in talks with Time Warner to buy a portion of America Online, according to several people with knowledge of the negotiations. The joint bid was widely seen as a way to head off Microsoft, which has also been negotiating to buy a minority stake in AOL. The development means that Time Warner, which has long been under pressure by Wall Street to sell off its AOL unit, now finds itself in the enviable position of having multiple suitors, which may drive up AOL's value.
2005-10-12	Google Earmarks $265 Million for Charity and Social Causes	Google gave the first details yesterday of how it would carry out its commitment to devote a share of its lucrative public stock offering to charity and social causes. It said it had donated $90 million to a new charitable foundation it started and would give another $175 million to nonprofit groups and what it considers socially useful businesses over the next two to three years. Sheryl Sandberg, a Google vice president for sales who is also coordinating the foundation and related programs, said the company would focus its charitable efforts in two areas: global poverty, and energy and the environment. She said the two priorities were selected by Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

2005-10-08	No News Is Good Blogging	THE joint news conference by Google and Sun Microsystems on Tuesday left a lot of people scratching their heads. It was billed as a significant announcement, but it turned out to be ''a lot of hand-waving about sharing and working together'' writes John Battelle on his Searchblog. The announcement was so vague that bloggers and analysts have since been constructing wildly disparate interpretations of it. Most immediately, Sun will include the Google Toolbar in downloads of its Java Runtime Environment, which enables, among other things, interactive features on Web pages.
2005-10-05	World Briefing | Asia: Taiwan: Protest Over Google Map	The Foreign Ministry asked that Google change the label on its maps that reads, ''Taiwan, Province of China.'' But the ministry did not offer an alternative, reflecting a bitter dispute on the island over whether it should call itself Taiwan, preferred by those favoring greater independence from the mainland, or Republic of China, preferred by those seeking political reunification with the mainland. Google had no immediate comment. Keith Bradsher (NYT)
2005-10-05	Google and Sun Announce a Joint Agreement	Google and Sun Microsystems announced a broad but vague agreement yesterday to develop and distribute each other's technology in a bid to expand their markets and challenge Microsoft's dominance of computer desktops. Under the agreement, Sun will include the Google toolbar as an option when consumers download the Java programming tool, a software program that is widely considered one of Sun's crown jewels. The deal is also expected to make it easier for customers to obtain OpenOffice, Sun's freely distributed office productivity suite that competes with Microsoft Office.

2005-10-01	Google Bids to Help San Francisco Go Wireless	Google ended months of speculation late Friday afternoon by submitting a proposal to offer a free wireless Internet service to the city of San Francisco. The proposal, which is one of a range of proposals being submitted both by large communications firms and small start-ups, is in response to a TechConnect program proposed by the city's mayor, Gavin Newsom, this year. Mr. Newsom has positioned the program as a way to offer universal and affordable broadband Internet access to the city's residents and businesses.
2005-09-28	Search and Rescue	AUTHORS struggle, mostly in vain, against their fated obscurity. According to Nielsen Bookscan, which tracks sales from major booksellers, only 2 percent of the 1.2 million unique titles sold in 2004 had sales of more than 5,000 copies. Against this backdrop, the recent Authors Guild suit against the Google Library Project is poignantly wrongheaded. The Authors Guild claims that Google's plan to make the collections of five major libraries searchable online violates copyright law and thus harms authors' interests. As both an author and publisher, I find the Guild's position to be exactly backward. Google Library promises to be a boon to authors, publishers and readers if Google sticks to its stated goal of creating a tool that helps people discover (and potentially pay for) copyrighted works. (Disclosure: I am a member of the publisher advisory board for Google Print. As the name implies, it is simply an advisory group, and Google can take or leave its suggestions.)
2005-09-27	How Many Pages in Google? Take a Guess	In the bitter war of words between Google and Yahoo over search-engine index size, Google has decided to give its latest answer in the form of a question. The company said yesterday that it had phased in a larger index over the last four weeks. But rather than directly proclaiming that it had surpassed its archrival Yahoo, which last month claimed index supremacy, Google said it would ask Web surfers to decide for themselves.
2005-09-26	Microsoft Plans to Sell Search Ads Of Its Own	The Microsoft Corporation will unveil today its own system for selling Web advertising as it struggles to compete with Google and Yahoo in the expanding Web search business. The system, to be used by MSN, is meant to improve on those of Microsoft's rivals by allowing marketers to aim ads on Web search pages to users based on their sex, age or location. The move is part of Microsoft's broad response to the threat from Google, which is using its powerful advertising sales network to support an expanding range of free software products and Internet services. Last week, Microsoft announced a broad reorganization that placed MSN in the same group as its Windows operating system, indicating that it saw software delivered over the Internet -- and possibly paid for through advertising -- as central to its future.
2005-09-22	Need Answers? Ask Anybody	When David Sarokin finishes his day job as an environmental scientist in Washington, he heads home to a second batch of questions. He is one of several hundred humans who work for Google, answering questions from users who aren't satisfied with their results from the automated engine that made Google famous. The queries that users bring to Google Answers (answers.google.com) touch on all parts of life, but they usually cannot be reduced to a few keywords. One incoming freshman at Bates College in Lewiston, Me., for instance, asked for help finding a parking spot near campus. A stargazer asked the name of the two planets rising early in the northwest sky, and a homeowner wanted a ''romantic and literary'' name for a new house.

Google intends to make money from the project by selling advertising on its search pages, much as it does on its popular online search-engine site."
2005-09-21	Avidly Seeking Wireless CluesFrom Google	Google, with deep pockets and seemingly boundless ambition, keeps marching steadily beyond Internet searching into new markets like e-mail, advertising, book searches, a satellite map service, instant messaging and telephony. Where next? The most intriguing recent guess, based on a few Google experiments, is free wireless Internet service. And there appear to be fascinating hints on several Web pages nestled in Google's site. They describe a new test service called Google Wi-Fi and indicate how to use its wireless desktop software, Google Secure Access.
2005-09-20	From Google to Noodles: A Chef Strikes Out on His Own	LIKE many employees at Google, Charlie Ayers profited handsomely when the company went public in August 2004.

2005-09-18	The Key to Google's $10 Million Man	IN the public tug of war over Kai-Fu Lee, a computer scientist at Microsoft who defected to Google, a Seattle judge ruled last week that Google can have him, but said he could not work on search and speech technologies, two of his specialties. Dr. Lee's case is striking not just because it highlights the intense rivalry that now exists between Google and Microsoft, but because two of the tech world's most powerful companies are going to such lengths to fight over one employee.
2005-09-16	Microsoft Said to Be in Talks on Forming Link to AOL	Microsoft and Time Warner have explored a variety of possible combinations of the MSN Internet portal with the America Online operation of Time Warner, including a merger of the two into a new company that would be jointly owned, according to several people involved in the talks. The discussions were initiated by Microsoft, which has Google, its new archrival, clearly in its sights. Microsoft is trying to focus its Internet operations on its developing Web search product rather than its Web portal and Internet access business, which it no longer sees as strategically important.

Google's follow-on offering, in which it sold 14.2 million shares at $295 each, was completed less than one month after Google filed to sell 14.159 million shares (a number that matches the digits of the mathematical term pi with the initial 3 removed).

The other thinks, ''I wonder what he meant by that?'' In high-tech circles, that's pretty much what people are saying about Google these days. If you hadn't noticed, Google is no longer just an Internet search tool; it's now a full-blown software company. It develops elegant, efficient software programs -- and then gives them away. In today's culture of cynicism, such generosity and software excellence seems highly suspicious; surely it's all a smokescreen for a darker, larger plot to suck us all in. What, exactly, is Google up to?

Now it has one such contender: the phenomenally successful Google. But instead of embracing Google as one of their own, many in Silicon Valley are skittish about its size and power. They fret that the very strengths that made Google a search-engine phenomenon are distancing it from the entrepreneurial culture that produced it -- and even transforming it into a threat."
2005-08-24	Google to Offer Instant Messaging and Voice Communications on Web	Google, the Internet search innovator, will make its first direct challenge to the broader communications industry on Wednesday when it introduces an instant-messaging and voice communication service for personal computers. The program, Google Talk, will allow its users to exchange text messages and converse through their computers with others at remote locations. Other instant-messaging services offer similar capabilities, but Google said the appeal of its system would come from its voice quality, based on audio technology it has developed.
2005-08-22	Where to Spend $4 Billion? Google Has Plenty of Projects in Mind	In all the speculation that followed the announcement from Google on Thursday that it planned to raise an additional $4 billion by selling stock, no one seemed to recall the space elevator. The elevator -- a fanciful alternative to rocket boosters to reach earth orbit -- is one of the dozens of business ideas that have been considered by the company's wide-eyed founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. It also is one of the ideas that the company's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, has taken pride in keeping ''below the line.''
2005-08-19	14	"159,265 New Slices Of Rich Technology"",""Google said in a surprise move on Thursday that it would raise a $4 billion war chest with a new stock offering. The announcement stirred widespread speculation in Silicon Valley that Google, the premier online search site, would move aggressively into businesses well beyond Web searching and search-based advertising. Google, which raised $1.67 billion in its initial public offering last August, expects to collect $4.04 billion by selling 14,159,265 million Class A shares, based on Wednesday's closing price of $285.10. In Google's whimsical fashion, the number of shares offered is the same as the first eight digits after the decimal point in pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, which starts with 3.14159265."
2005-08-15	Popular Demand	Google, which still captures the bulk of Internet searches, is now taking aim at local search -- a service akin to yellow pages listings, but with Web links, user reviews and maps.

But between February and July, Google's share of the local search market grew 61 percent, compared with Yahoo's 14 percent growth.

2005-08-13	Google Library Database Is Delayed	Google said yesterday that it would temporarily halt its program to make searchable, digital copies of the vast contents of three university libraries to give publishers and other copyright holders the chance to opt out of having their protected works copied. But a publishing trade association called the opt-out offer inadequate, saying it did not address the main concern of its members: the belief that the entire program, the Google Print Library Project, is built on a foundation of purposeful copyright violation.
2005-08-08	Hear the Big Pop?

Shares in Baidu soared Friday on the Nasdaq stock market in one of the most successful initial public offerings since the peak of the dot-com era. The stock more than quadrupled by the end of the day, instantly creating the most valuable Internet company in China. The shares were priced at $27 but opened at $66 and then soared to $122.54.

CNETNews.com, a technology news Web site, said last week that Google had told it that the company would not answer any questions from CNET's reporters until July 2006. The move came after CNET published an article last month that discussed how the Google search engine can uncover personal information and that raised questions about what information Google collects about its users."

2005-07-16	Click Fraud and Halli-Bloggers	GOOGLE is expected to announce next week that its revenue doubled over the last year, to $841 million or so. A huge chunk of that is a result of someone's tapping a mouse button. Through its AdWords program, Google is paid when people click on the keyword-generated ads that appear next to search results. Not surprisingly, a lot of people try to game the system -- for instance, by repeatedly clicking on a competitor's ad links. Click Defense Inc. sued Google last month, contending that it hasn't done enough to prevent ''click fraud.'' And in discussions on sites like Slashdot and SearchEngineWatch, some are wondering whether the search companies' very existence is threatened by the tactic.
2005-07-14	Critical Shopper; What? Your Watch Only Tells Time?	LIKE the other conductors who worked for the Chesapeake & Ohio in the early part of the last century, my great-grandfather carried a pocket watch whose accuracy had been approved by the railroad. In that pretech era, he set his beloved Hamilton with a lever that popped out of the side of its face. It ran accurately at temperatures from freezing to August and was precise to within 30 seconds a week. All my great-grandfather had to do to reassure himself that order reigned in the universe was to squint at the sweeping second hand and confirm that the Big Sandy local from Prestonsburg, Ky., would arrive at Beaver Junction at 10:50 a.m., on time.
2005-07-14	Q & A	Going to School By Way of the Net Q. What is involved in taking a college course online? A. Many colleges and universities have distance-learning programs that let you take courses over the Internet, but the experience will vary, depending on the class and the technology used by the school. Some courses may require nothing more than sending in papers written in Microsoft Word by e-mail or copying them onto a special folder on one of the school's file servers, while a computer-science course may require that you install special software on your computer to use for the class.
2005-07-04	Dear Blog: Today I Worked on My Book	When he has writer's block, John Battelle, author of the forthcoming book ''The Search: The Inside Story of How Google and Its Rivals Changed Everything,'' keeps on writing. But not his book manuscript. Instead, he goes straight to his blog (battellemedia.com). Mr. Battelle, a founder of Wired and The Industry Standard magazines, sometimes makes quick notes on the blog about a topic related to his book, and other times posts longer essays. ''Writing for the blog is more like having a conversation,'' Mr. Battelle said.

2005-06-30	Microsoft Said to Be in Talks To Buy Adware Developer	For the last two weeks, Microsoft has been in talks to buy a private Silicon Valley company, a move that underscores just how eager Microsoft is to catch up with Google, the search and advertising giant. The company that Microsoft has pursued is controversial: Claria, an adware marketer formerly called Gator, and best known for its pop-up ads and software that tracks people visiting Web sites. The Gator adware has frequently been denounced by privacy advocates for its intrusiveness.
2005-06-28	At $300 a Share	" Google Looks Pricey And Still Irresistible"",""David Edwards, a financial analyst with American Technology Research, wants to believe in Google. But how do you embrace a stock that has more than tripled in 10 months and cracked the $300-a-share barrier so quickly since going public that much of its growth potential seems already built into the price? In early May, when Google was trading for $236, Mr. Edwards sent a note to clients of his firm, a group that includes wealthy individuals and money managers, recommending that they buy Google stock."
2005-06-20	Google Said To Plan Rival To PayPal	Google is preparing an online-payment system that would compete with PayPal, according to an online retailer who has been approached by Google to take part in the effort. In addition to representing a direct challenge to eBay, which owns PayPal, the largest Internet payment system, the move signals Google's intention to become much more deeply involved in online commerce.

A Web search indicated that dozens of pages on FT.com had links to Moneysupermarket.com, a price comparison site. The links would help Moneysupermarket.com's rankings in Web search results."

The other answer is: It doesn't really matter anyway."
2005-06-11	Searching For a Reason To Buy Google	IN this souped-up, high-tech world, everything happens faster, even forgetting. Usually a generation passes before investors stung in a mania make the same mistake again, but anyone looking at a chart of Google's stock price might think that its shareholders don't have that kind of time. Five years after the tech bubble came and went, the search engine operator has bounded from about $180 a share in April to nearly $300.
2005-06-02	A Tidy Option for Data Pack Rats	Millions of PC users have relied on Flash drives or other pint-size hard drive storage units to safeguard valuable files. But those portable drives can be broken or lost. And if you need critical documents -- or favorite songs or photos -- while on the road, many Internet kiosk computers in places like airports do not have USB ports to plug the portable drive into. Internet companies like Yahoo and AOL, as well as some smaller competitors, have taken aim at these problems by allowing users to store nearly any kind of file on their secure servers. The stored files can then be retrieved from any Internet-connected computer.
2005-06-02	Loosing Google's Lock on the Past	IN the winter of 1996, back when I was a brunette who wore sensible shoes, a photographer snapped my picture during a rehearsal for a college musical. The production mattered; eating and sleeping did not. The resulting portrait showed a pasty, gaunt girl being swallowed by a XXX-large T-shirt. The only thing more unfortunate than the photo is that nearly a decade after it was taken -- a decade in which I became a blonde and graduated to stilettos -- it is still the definitive image of me on the World Wide Web, the one that pops up every time my name is entered in a Google search. It even has the dubious distinction of being in the top 10 hits in a list of several hundred, most of them articles I have written.
2005-05-25	Arts	" Briefly; Challenging Google"",""How long is a snippet? That is one of more than a dozen questions directed at Google Inc. this week by the executive director of the Association of American University Presses, the trade group representing university presses. At issue is whether Google Print for Libraries, the company's plan to digitize the collections of some of the country's major university libraries, infringes the copyrights of the authors of many books in those collections. The program will allow users to search the contents of books, displaying context-specific ''snippets'' of the texts of copyrighted works. In a letter to Google dated Friday, the details of which were first reported by BusinessWeek on Monday, Peter Givler, executive director of the press association, said that Google Print for Libraries ''appears to involve systematic infringement of copyright on a massive scale.'' Mr. Givler said the service has ''the potential for serious financial damage'' to the members of the press association, a collection of largely not-for-profit businesses that typically produce and sell scholarly works of nonfiction that have relatively little commercial potential. In a statement, Google said that it has an ''active dialogue with all of our publishing partners,'' adding that it protects the copyright holders by allowing users of Google Print to view only a few short sentences of protected text.

Mr. Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chief software architect, also said that he was skeptical of Google's ability to maintain its dominance in the search marketplace indefinitely. Increasingly, he asserted, that competition will revolve around new technologies and take place in new arenas, like searching local information, where Google is less dominant than in Web searching."

2005-05-21	Google This: Is Microsoft Still a Bully?	NOT long ago, I went to Washington for a dinner given by a friend. She wanted to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the end of the Microsoft antitrust trial, which she had covered for a news agency and I had covered for Fortune magazine. In all, about 10 of us made it to the dinner, and it wasn't long before we were regaling one another about the ''good old days'' of the trial -- laughing at the way Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson used to roll his eyes at Microsoft's witnesses, and recalling how the superlawyer David Boies, whose daily skewering of Microsoft gave the trial most of its entertainment value, would put straws in his jacket pocket when he went out drinking with us so he could keep track of how many drinks he had.
2005-05-20	Google Moves To Challenge Web Portals	The expanse of white space at the bottom of Google's main Web page, possibly the most valuable undeveloped real estate in cyberspace, is about to be subdivided. Moving more directly into competition with portals like Yahoo, MSN and AOL, the search company today unveiled a feature that allows users to personalize the Google home page with features they use frequently, like stock quotes, news and e-mail.
2005-05-19	Google Unveils a Search Tool for Business Users	Google, the most frequently used Internet search engine, released a product yesterday that can find files and e-mail messages on business computers, an effort to have its software installed on corporate personal computers and guide more users to its site. The free product, called Google Desktop Search for Enterprise, is intended for companies that do not permit employees to use Google's existing file-search tool because of security concerns, said Dave Girouard, a general manager in Google's enterprise group.

2005-05-02	Search engines like Google and Yahoo have it so good that competitors for ad dollars are making sales for them.	CONSIDER this somewhat strange development: search engines like Google and Yahoo have become so proficient at attracting advertising that even competitors, like newspapers and yellow pages publishers, are now selling ads on their behalf. Newspapers like The Houston Chronicle, which is owned by the Hearst Corporation, and yellow pages publishers like the BellSouth Corporation and SBC Communications have recently turned themselves into de facto agents for the search engines in the small-business market, where the Internet companies have had limited success.

The new service, My Web, is a social bookmarks manager, clipping service and blogging tool wrapped into one. Users can save a copy of any Web page in a storage area and find that page instantly by searching My Web. The pages can then be categorized and shared with others.
2005-04-26	Newspapers Find National Ads a Tough Sell	Mark DiMassimo, an advertising executive in New York, recently heard from a major client who decided to pull back on advertising in nationally circulated newspapers. The company's executives wanted to try a more targeted local-newspaper approach -- inspired, perhaps, by the narrowly focused ads proliferating online. ''One day they woke up and said, 'I'm sure some of this advertising is working, but I don't know how to tell if any of it is,''' said Mr. DiMassimo, chief executive and creative director at his own agency.

Starting today, Google will test changes to its advertising program that will give advertisers more control over where their ads are shown, how they pay for them and what they look like.
2005-04-22	Google Revenue Nearly Doubles in Quarter	Google continues to turn its popular Web search service into a rapidly growing and highly profitable business. In the first quarter, the company said yesterday, its revenue nearly doubled from the comparable period a year ago and its profits increased more than fivefold. The fastest growth came from Google.com and other sites the company owned, but it also posted sharp increases in revenue it gets from selling ads and placing them on other sites, like some run by America Online.

When two people are at computers running Skype, they can talk to each other (using a headset or microphone) as long as they want, with sound quality far better than that of telephones, absolutely free. Skype conference calls can include up to five participants -- I have used this feature to talk simultaneously, from Washington, with people in England, New Zealand and California, at no cost to any of us. Working out the time zones was the real challenge.

2005-04-11	France Detects a Cultural Threat in Google	As president of the French National Library, Jean-Noël Jeanneney has good reason to feel safe from the frequent incursions of American popular culture into contemporary French life. With its collection of 13 million books, the library is a reassuring symbol of the durability of French literature and thought. Yet Mr. Jeanneney is not one to lower his guard. He grew alarmed last December when he read that Google planned to scan 15 million English-language books and make them available as digital files on the Web. In his view, the move would further strengthen American power to set a global cultural agenda.
2005-04-05	Technology Briefs | Services: Google To Enhance Map Service	Google said yesterday that it was enhancing its Google Maps service using the satellite mapping imagery it acquired last year when it bought the Keyhole Corporation, a small Silicon Valley start-up. By combining satellite and aerial images with mapping data, the service allows users to view both maps and travel directions superimposed on high-resolution digital photos by selecting a satellite mode. As with the original Keyhole product, it is possible to zoom in and out and scroll across the satellite image in any direction. The feature will also be part of the Google Local service, which helps users find local businesses. Keyhole, now a unit of Google, will continue to offer stand-alone software products that feature a 3-D global database of images and map data. Google is based in Mountain View, Calif.

2005-04-02	Google Doubling Storage on Free E-Mail Service	Google Inc., the Internet search engine company, is doubling the amount of storage offered on its e-mail service and plans to remove limits on message capacity as it competes for users with Yahoo Inc. Users of Google's service will be able to store two gigabytes of e-mail messages, double the storage previously offered, the director of the company's e-mail group, Georges Harik, said. One gigabyte, or 1,024 megabytes, is roughly equivalent to the content in 32 feet of shelves filled with books.

2005-02-24	Tools to Add Moving Images To Online Musings	THE Oxford English Dictionary added ''blog'' to its entries in 2003. The editors may soon have to consider ''vlog'' and ''moblog'' as well. Web logs -- the personal online journals better known as blogs -- use text to dissect nearly every conceivable topic, and now video blogs, or vlogs, which incorporate moving images, are on the rise. Mobile blogs, or moblogs, have brought blogging into the cellular age by allowing people to post video and photos taken with camera phones to a blog, or to call in an audio posting.

2005-02-13	The Nation:  Teaching Students to Swim in the Online Sea	INFORMATION literacy seems to be a phrase whose time has come. Last month, the Educational Testing Service announced that it had developed a test to measure students' ability to evaluate online material. That suggested an official recognition that the millions spent to wire schools and universities is of little use unless students know how to retrieve useful information from the oceans of sludge on the Web. Clearly, ''computer skills'' are not enough. A teacher of Scandinavian literature at Berkeley recently described how students used the Web to research a paper on the Vikings: ''They're Berkeley students, so, of course, they have the sense to restrict their searches to 'vikings NOT minnesota.' But they're perfectly willing to believe a Web site that describes early Viking settlements in Oklahoma.''

2005-02-07	Now that Google can sell domain names	" will it expand its business beyond search services?"",""AFTER Google disclosed last week that it had been granted the right to sell domain names, the question in many minds was, ''Why?'' Why would the company, which just reported click-advertising sales of more than $1 billion in the most recent quarter, compete in a relatively low-margin business with Network Solutions, Yahoo, GoDaddy and others? Would it use its new registrar status to snap up expired domains and show ads to wayward surfers? Is this a move toward Google world domination? ''In a few years you'll be driving your Google to the Google to buy some Google for your Google,'' read one posting on Slashdot, an online technology forum."
2005-02-07	Hate Messages On Google Site Draw Concern	Over the last year, millions of Internet users have gravitated to Orkut, a Web site created and run by Google that permits people, by invitation only, to join any of a long list of online communities. Communities have been created around a shared interest in photography, Miles Davis's music and travel to offbeat places. A small minority, however, advance a hatred for Jews, blacks or gays, including a ''Death to the Jews'' site and a site called ''Death to Blacks.''
2005-02-04	Web Search Sites See Clicks Add Up To Big Ad Dollars	When the year's largest television audience convenes for the Super Bowl on Sunday, advertisers will be spending an estimated $2.4 million for each 30-second cinema-quality commercial. But just as important to many of those same advertisers is the $1.50 or so a mouse click that they may spend on the Google Internet search site, at any hour on any day, for a few words of plain text that will link prospective customers to the advertisers' Web sites. The fact that Eli Lilly, Napster, Novartis and Staples are among Super Bowl advertisers that are also regulars on Google is not the only evidence that Web advertising has come of age.

With Google's stock on a roll, rising more than 7 percent yesterday to close at $205.96 and prompting some analysts to predict it will hit $290 or more in the coming months, it can seem like the late 1990's again on Wall Street. Shares in Google have been trading for less than six months, but they have risen 142 percent and the company has a market value of $56.2 billion, equal to that of Starbucks, Nike and Southwest Airlines -- combined."

2005-01-31	Search Sites Play a Game of Constant Catch-Up	Last Monday, Google representatives called analysts and reporters to trumpet a new service that searches the transcripts of television broadcasts. Yahoo, Google's rival, got wind of the announcement and within hours, its publicity machine had bolted into action to say it had a similar service in the works. Perhaps the fiercest competition on the Internet these days is among sites offering new ways to search through more information. Yahoo and Microsoft each have hundreds of engineers trying to challenge Google's leadership, and dozens of minor players are trying to find ways of getting their services noticed. A9, Amazon.com's search service, recently sent vans with digital cameras onto the streets of some cities to take pictures of businesses. The photos were later displayed alongside telephone numbers in A9's phone directory.

The services will look for keywords in the closed captioning information that is encoded in many programs, mainly as an aid to deaf viewers. Google's service, scheduled to be introduced today, does not actually permit people to watch the video on their computers. Instead, it presents them with short excerpts of program transcripts with text matching their search queries and a single image from the program. Google records TV programs for use in the service.

Google does. Taking the stance that unorthodox usage and punctuation and slang create a less straightforward searching experience, Google's AdWords division, which is responsible for the contextual ads that appear alongside search results, insists on standard English and punctilious punctuation. Cater to teenagers hooked on text messaging? This is a world with no ''dealz 4 u.''

2004-12-30	A New Script for Searching Texts Written by Hand	GOOGLE'S experimental service Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) scours the Web for academic papers. But while it may prove an asset for students and those who work in areas like science, neither it nor any other search engine is very useful for historians whose research involves plowing through documents from the time when handwriting ruled. Even after handwritten documents have been scanned and made available through the Web, it is not possible for Google or any other widely used searching technology to read them. The only method in use for searching such documents involves first having them typed into standard computer text, a costly and time-consuming process.
2004-12-26	At I.B.M.	" That Google Thing Is So Yesterday"",""SUDDENLY, the computer world is interesting again. The last three months of 2004 brought more innovation, faster, than users have seen in years. The recent flow of products and services differs from those of previous hotly competitive eras in two ways. The most attractive offerings are free, and they are concentrated in the newly sexy field of ''search.'' Google, current heavyweight among systems for searching the Internet, has not let up from its pattern of introducing features and products every few weeks. Apart from its celebrated plan to index the contents of several university libraries, Google has recently released ''beta'' (trial) versions of Google Scholar, which returns abstracts of academic papers and shows how often they are cited by other scholars, and Google Suggest, a weirdly intriguing feature that tries to guess the object of your search after you have typed only a letter or two. Give it ''po'' and it will show shortcuts to poetry, Pokémon, post office, and other popular searches. (If you stop after ''p'' it will suggest ''Paris Hilton.'') In practice, this is more useful than it sounds."
2004-12-22	Technology Briefing | Internet: Worm Searches Google Sites	A Web worm, the Santy worm, that identifies potential victims by searching Google is spreading among online bulletin boards, security professionals said yesterday. The worm uses a flaw in the widely used community forum software PHP Bulletin Board to spread, according to updated analyses. Kaspersky Labs, an antivirus company, said the worm searches Google for sites that use a vulnerable version of the software. Almost 40,000 sites may have already been infected.

2004-12-21	The Electronic Library	Last week, Google announced an ambitious new plan to start converting millions of books into digital files in partnership with several major libraries, including the New York Public Library and the libraries at Harvard, Stanford and Oxford. This is a logical step for Google, which says its mission ''is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.'' The idea of making books available online is not new, but this plan represents an enormous shift in scale, so enormous that if it is carried out successfully, it may redefine the nature of the Internet and the university. The library is the heart of every university, and one of the basic tasks a university performs is to preserve books and control access to them. No matter how liberally a university chooses to define ''access,'' its books are restricted by geography at the very least. Google wants to make the books it scans freely available in searchable, full-text forms to anyone, anywhere, with an Internet connection. It will also provide information for finding the nearest copy of the real physical book.
2004-12-20	Rice University Computer Scientists Find a Flaw in Google's New Desktop Search Program	A Rice University computer scientist and two of his students have discovered a potentially serious security flaw in the desktop search tool for personal computers that was recently distributed by Google. The glitch, which could permit an attacker to secretly search the contents of a personal computer via the Internet, is what computer scientists call a composition flaw -- a security weakness that emerges when separate components interact. ''When you put them together, out jumps a security flaw,'' said Dan Wallach, an assistant professor of computer science at Rice in Houston, who, with two graduate students, Seth Fogarty and Seth Nielson, discovered the flaw last month. ''These are subtle problems, and it takes a lot of experience to ferret out this kind of flaw,'' Professor Wallach said.
2004-12-19	Ideas & Trends:  The Pursuit of Knowledge	" From Genesis to Google"",""ONE warm afternoon in the late 19th century, two middle-aged office clerks met on the same bench of the Boulevard Bourdon in Paris and immediately became the best of friends. Bouvard and Pécuchet (the names Gustave Flaubert gave to his two comic heroes) discovered through their friendship a common purpose: the pursuit of universal knowledge. To achieve this ambitious goal, they attempted to read everything they could find on every branch of human endeavor and, from their readings, cull the most outstanding facts and ideas. Flaubert's death in 1880 put an end to their enterprise, which was in essence endless, but not before the two brave explorers had read their way through many learned volumes on agriculture, literature, animal husbandry, medicine, archeology and politics, always with disappointing results. What Flaubert's two clowns discovered is what we have always known but seldom believed: that the accumulation of knowledge isn't knowledge. The desire to know everything on earth and in heaven is so ancient that one of the earliest accounts of this ambition is already a cautionary tale. According to the 11th chapter of Genesis, after the Flood, the people of the earth journeyed east, to the land of Shinar, and decided to build a city and a tower that would reach the heavens."
2004-12-18	Questions and Praise For Google Web Library	When Randall C. Jimerson, the president of the Society of American Archivists, heard of Google's plan to convert certain holdings at Oxford University and at some of the leading research libraries in the United States into digital files, freely searchable over the Web, he asked, ''What are they thinking?'' Mr. Jimerson had worries. Who would select the material? How would it be organized and identified to avoid mountains of decontextualized excerpts? Would Google users eventually forgo the experience of holding a book, actually seeing a historical document, the serendipity of slow research?
2004-12-16	Judge Dismisses One Crucial Claim Made in Suit Against Google	A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., dismissed a crucial claim yesterday in the trademark infringement suit brought against Google by Geico, the auto insurance company owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

2004-12-16	Are Google's New Libraries a Good Thing?	To the Editor: The news that Google is adding the contents of major libraries to its database reminds me of a science fiction story I read more than half a century ago. The story told of mankind's effort to put all the information available in the world into a gargantuan computer and then ask the computer a single question: ''What is the meaning of life?''
2004-12-16	Are Google's New Libraries a Good Thing?	To the Editor: Re ''Google Is Adding Major Libraries to Its Database'' (front page, Dec. 14): While having online access to some great libraries promises to facilitate research in democratizing access to books, it is worth keeping some things in mind. A digital version of a book -- especially a rare one, printed centuries ago -- is not a replacement for the hard copy.
2004-12-16	Are Google's New Libraries a Good Thing?	To the Editor: The statement by Michael A. Keller, Stanford University's head librarian, that in two decades most of the world's knowledge will be digitized and available is unrealistic. While Google's inclusion of major library collections in its search engine is a small step toward digitizing the world's knowledge, a major portion of the small research libraries in the United States does not even have online catalogs, let alone digitized collections.
2004-12-16	Are Google's New Libraries a Good Thing?

2004-12-14	GOOGLE IS ADDING MAJOR LIBRARIES TO ITS DATABASE	Google, the operator of the world's most popular Internet search service, plans to announce an agreement today with some of the nation's leading research libraries and Oxford University to begin converting their holdings into digital files that would be freely searchable over the Web. It may be only a step on a long road toward the long-predicted global virtual library. But the collaboration of Google and research institutions that also include Harvard, the University of Michigan, Stanford and the New York Public Library is a major stride in an ambitious Internet effort by various parties. The goal is to expand the Web beyond its current valuable, if eclectic, body of material and create a digital card catalog and searchable library for the world's books, scholarly papers and special collections.
2004-12-13	A trademark infringement suit against Google may alter how the search industry makes a profit.	A FEDERAL judge in Alexandria, Va., will hear opening arguments today in a case that pits Geico against Google.

By allowing competing insurance companies to buy ads linked to searches for ''Geico'' and ''Geico Direct,'' Geico asserted, Google directs Web surfers seeking Geico to its competitors' sites.
2004-12-12	Benign Corporate Oligarchy	" The"",""When Google went public in August, investors hoped the much anticipated event would herald a return to late-90's stock-market populism: the idea that the Internet would not only make us all rich; it would also give us power. But the real idea behind the Google initial public offering goes back much further -- to the kind of noblesse oblige that J.P. Morgan championed. Google's founders, Larry Page, 32, and Sergey Brin, 31, seem like nice modern fellows, but they have old-fashioned ideas about shareholder relations. The shareholder, in their view, is a child -- fickle and hyperactive. Care for him, provide for him and, above all, keep him from the ruinous path of instant gratification."

2004-11-22	Does Bigger Mean Better?	Last week, Google announced that it had doubled, to more than eight billion, the number of Web pages its search engine can find. The announcement -- a search engine version of trash-talking -- came one day before Microsoft introduced its search engine, which has indexed about five billion pages. That makes Microsoft a distant second -- for now --in the race to cover the largest swath of the Internet. Yahoo does not make the number of pages in its index available to the public. SearchEngineWatch, a Web site that covers the industry, estimates, however, that Yahoo ranks third with about four billion pages.

As the stock prices of companies like Google and eBay soared this year, two of the biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street, who four years ago were derided as false prophets too eager to put the commercial interests of their firms ahead of investors, are basking in a renewed glow. Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley -- who was celebrated and then disparaged as the ''queen of the Net'' -- is once more out on the stump, extolling the commercial opportunities of the Internet, churning out comprehensive reports and using her still considerable sway to help land Wall Street's biggest investment banking deals -- like Google's public offering -- for her firm."
2004-11-11	Microsoft Unveils Its Internet Search Engine	" Quietly"",""Microsoft rolled out its long-planned response to Google and Yahoo in the Internet search industry on Wednesday, but with an uncharacteristically soft-sell approach. The debut, taking the form of a test site, was a stark contrast to another high-profile introduction the company made nine years ago. That was when Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, all but declared war on Netscape Communications and its Web browser by announcing his company's own browser, Internet Explorer, and proclaiming, ''We are hard core about the Internet.''"
2004-11-01	New Web sites make it possible for shoppers to compare retail prices at brick-and-mortar stores before deciding where to buy.	SHOPPING comparison sites let consumers check prices and products across tens of thousands of online retailers. But what if they want to see the prices at the local mall that day? A trio of new online companies -- Cairo.com, ShopLocal.com and StepUp.com -- are trying to fill that need. For example, Cairo.com, which introduced its Web site late last month, scans the Web sites of about 25 national merchants to cull sales data from the retailers' weekly circulars. Consumers enter their ZIP code and can search the database for particular items, or register to receive an e-mail message when the price of an item drops.
2004-10-31	The Stock? Whatever. Google Keeps On Innovating.	SIX months ago, Google was intriguing mainly as a financial phenomenon. Would its initial public offering come too early? Or too late? Would it succeed, signaling a broader tech revival? Or would it fail, deepening the gloom about Internet-based businesses? Today, Google is still plenty interesting for financial reasons. In the weeks before its shares first went on sale in August, disparaging views about its prospects forced it to lower the target price to $85 a share from $135. By last week, its stock had more than doubled, to $190.64, giving it a market capitalization of $52 billion, more than Ford and General Motors combined.

Google, the Internet search engine provider, reported that its profit and revenue more than doubled in the first quarter after its initial public offering. The results led its shares, which had closed up $8.89, or 6.33 percent, at $149.38, to continue skyward, jumping another 8.25 percent, to $161.70, in after-hours trading. The price was nearly double the initial offering of $85 a share in mid-August."
2004-10-21	Google Takes On Your Desktop	THE modern PC is a marvel, isn't it? Here's a machine that lets an ordinary person with very little training create a new document, check its spelling, dress it up with graphics, send it electronically to someone across the globe -- and then save it accidentally into some dark corner of the hard drive, where it will never be seen again. Of course, every operating system offers a Find command. But the one in Windows is not, ahem, Microsoft's finest work. It requires too many clicks, it asks too many questions, it takes forever, it can't search your e-mail and its results are difficult to interpret. As a final insult, Microsoft endowed the supposedly ultramodern Windows XP with a cartoon dog that appears during the searching, as though to say, ''We know this is taking a long time, but hey, watch the puppy!''

2004-08-20	After Months Of Hoopla	" Google Debut Fits the Norm"",""In the end, Google had a fairly normal I.P.O. In the stock's first day of trading, investors bought, sold and flipped shares at a furious pace, with the price ending just above $100 -- 18 percent above where it started."
2004-08-20	Google Goes Public	After a series of missteps, Google finally pulled off its much-hyped initial public offering yesterday. The good news about this unusual I.P.O., which sought to deprive Wall Street banks of full control over the sale, is that it made it easier for individual investors to buy the stock. Of course, that may also be the bad news. At its closing price of just above $100 yesterday, Google is valued at a bubbly $27 billion. The co-founders of the Google search engine, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, got very rich yesterday, and deservedly so. This Internet icon that raised $1.67 billion yesterday by selling only a small percentage of its shares didn't even exist six years ago. Now its very name is part of the information age lexicon, as people talk about ''Googling'' someone.
2004-08-19	Ouch! Insiders Feel an Unexpected Pinch	Investors' hesitance about Google's offering cost some very important people -- the insiders -- millions of dollars. Google's top executives wound up taking out only a third as much as they had hoped when the company priced its offering last night. And the venture capitalists, who had nurtured Google and had expected to take out more money than anyone else, wound up not selling any shares at all. Google priced its offering at $85 a share last night, far below the $108 to $135 it had been expecting and at the bottom of the new range it set yesterday morning. In the process, it also had to scale back the number of shares being sold by selling stockholders.
2004-08-19	Weak Demand Leads Google to Lower Its Sights	Google, conceding that demand for its long-awaited public stock offering had fallen far short of the company's hopes, reduced the number of shares yesterday and concluded its unorthodox online auction by accepting a price well below its original target. The final price was $85, far off the target range of $108 to $135 a share that the company projected last month. The shares are expected to begin trading today on the Nasdaq market.
2004-08-18	So Google Is Almost Public. Now Comes the Hard Part.	If Google does finally succeed in raising billions of dollars through its initial stock offering, the next big challenge will be proving that its success is not an accident -- that the company, operator of the world's dominant Web search engine, can survive from one technological generation to the next. Even the money part is not yet certain. The Securities and Exchange Commission delayed final approval of Google's registration statement on Tuesday night, without comment. Whether the delay was merely procedural or whether it involved matters of substance to the S.E.C. could not be determined.
2004-08-17	Google Says It's Set to End Stock Auction	Google said yesterday that it might conclude the bidding in its auction-style initial public offering late today, leaving it a step away from becoming a publicly traded company. The company, which operates the most popular Web search service, formally asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to begin selling its shares after 4 p.m. today. On its Web site, Google advised investors that the stock's underwriters might accept the auction bids as soon as 5 p.m. At that point, investors who have placed bids since the auction began last Friday may be notified that they are among the winners.
2004-08-16	Big Buys	" but Not by the Little Guys"",""The smart money is betting that the smart money will prevail in the Google auction. And that, experienced investors say, could be good even for the little guys. Despite Google's stated intention to make its initial public offering a democratic process, the game is playing out in a way that is likely to give big institutional investors the upper hand, in the view of professional investors like Richard Abraham and Mark J. Pincus -- a view confirmed by several money managers overseeing large institutional funds."

Ms. Trout, 54, the president of Guardian Care Surgical in Louisa, Ky., has never bought a stock in her life. She has never owned so much as a single share of a mutual fund.

Yesterday, Google started its own search, one that will be far slower -- it will take most of a week -- and far less complicated, probably involving thousands of documents, or a few million at most. Indeed, Google is searching for just one number: the price at which it will sell stock to the public for the first time.

It stopped registering potential bidders yesterday afternoon and said it would start accepting bids, through the brokerage firms that are underwriting the offering, at 9 a.m. today. The company said it expected to end the auction sometime next week.

Google's initial public offering, once seen as a catalyst that could turn the slumping technology stock market around, has been delayed for about a week in the face of both technical snags and increasing investor skepticism. The unconventional auction could still proceed this week or early next week.

By dumb luck, the movie suggested, its guileless hero had amassed so many millions that he could finance a Gump Medical Center, build a Baptist church and allow the family of his fallen friend Bubba to live in luxury.

Google and three other major search engines were temporarily affected by searches for e-mail addresses generated by the MyDoom worm, according to security experts. The experts said it was impossible to know whether the attack was timed to Google's announcement because the worm's origins are unknown, but they said a link was highly unlikely.

But the lawyers' bumper stickers probably say, ''You can't copyright an idea.''

2004-06-25	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a revised prospectus for the initial public stock offering of Google misidentified the source of a ''Google bomb,'' a form of online manipulation that causes a designated Web page to appear as the first response to a particular phrase search. (In this case, the tactic caused the search engine to reply to the phrase ''out of touch management'' by displaying a Web page that described Google's top management.) While a person close to the company said Google employees had engaged in the practice, Daniel Brandt, the operator of a Web site critical of Google, later acknowledged that he was the source.

2004-06-22	Silicon Valley (Version 2.0) Has Hopes Rising for Economic Rebound	''Silicon Valley is back'' is on the lips of eager entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, who are rejoicing over the success of Google and pointing to the modest comeback in computer sales. The three-year-long depression, they say, is over. But other signs tell a different story. The famed traffic jams of Silicon Valley's boom times are still uncommon. A last-minute reservation at some of the area's hot restaurants, like Tamarine or Spago Palo Alto, can still be had. And a suite in a gleaming office park that would have cost nearly $10 a square foot in monthly rent in 1999 can now be had for less than $3.

So if your friend sends you a message about his vacation in Florida, you will see text ads for beach resorts to the right of the message. When your mother writes about her new digital camera, photography ads appear.

2004-06-13	How Google Took the Work Out of Selling Advertising	WHEN the computer age began, some people warned that the rise of word-processing systems would mean the decline of skillful writing. The idea was that computers would make writing so automatic and easy -- yeah, sure --that fine points of thought and language would be buffed away, leaving depersonalized, machinelike prose. In retrospect, there was nothing to worry about. Books, articles and lectures are now as good, and bad, as they have ever been. One area that technology has obviously changed is personal communication, through e-mail and instant messaging. But there, its main effect has been positive, in reviving what had been the moribund idea that people, even teenagers, could stay in touch through written as well as spoken words.

2004-05-28	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Offers Software To Counter Spyware	Yahoo, the owner of the second-most-used Internet search engine, is offering software to help customers keep their Web surfing private in an attempt to lure users from Google and from the MSN Internet unit of Microsoft. The Yahoo software will help consumers search for and purge their computers of so-called spyware. Spyware programs are downloaded to personal computers without their owners' knowledge. Companies use spyware to monitor Web sites visited, to display advertising and to redirect Web browsers to sites their users did not intend to visit. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is adding the feature to its toolbar, a row of boxes on users' screens that link to the search engine and other functions and also carry the company's logo. Yahoo is trying to persuade more people to install and use its toolbar. Google, the No.1 search engine, based in Mountain View, Calif., and Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., offer toolbars without spyware destroyers. Yahoo shares rose 45 cents to $30.56.

The letter was signed by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and the World Privacy Forum, not just the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The column also included an outdated reference to California legislation prompted by such concerns. As amended, the bill would allow some scanning of e-mail contents by service providers; it would not make it illegal to filter out pornography.

The company said its consultants who worked with Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., will receive about 50 percent of any gains from the warrants. The warrants would let Heidrick & Struggles pay about $357,000 for a 0.5 percent stake, based on the number of shares outstanding that Google reported last month. After the public offering, Heidrick's stake could be worth more than $85 million, based on analysts' estimates that the value of Google will be at least $17 billion.

And the business conversation has changed much over the last few months. Our obsession with villains -- Martha, Frank, et al. -- has begun to fade, what with nearly all of them being investigated, tried or convicted, or awaiting sentencing. How long can a country's blood boil? These days, two new stories dominate the headlines and monopolize chatter around the water cooler. And those stories are about heroes: Donald J.

Equally unusual is the company's decision to sell shares to investors through a public auction. But while Google's stated goals and the auction process may be intriguing to investors, many analysts say that Google -- the Web search engine company with an offbeat corporate culture and big financial power -- is unlikely to provide a blueprint for going public for other start-up companies. In addition, many venture capitalists said they did not expect, or even want, Google to inspire a spate of new public offerings if new companies are not yet ready.
2004-05-01	Google Poses A Challenge For Usual Ad Outlets	The plan by Google to auction its shares may represent a challenge to Wall Street but the striking success of its Internet advertising business poses perhaps an even greater threat to Madison Avenue. Unlike conventional advertising, to which vast creative effort is devoted to make it funny or pithy or just downright annoying enough to attract attention, an Internet search engine like Google or Yahoo already has access to users looking for something in particular. Companies with a commercial message can easily reach a vast collection of people one by one who are actually interested in what they have to sell.
2004-04-30	Google's Sale of Its Shares Will Defy Wall St. Tradition	Ending months of speculation, Google said Thursday that it would sell shares to public investors in an unusual auction that represents a stark shift from the way Silicon Valley companies raised money during the technology boom of the 1990's. The stock offering, which is intended to provide about $2.7 billion in cash when it takes place later this year, is expected to give Google a market value on Wall Street of at least $30 billion and perhaps $50 billion or more. It will transform the two former graduate students who founded it less than six years ago into instant billionaires several times over.

2004-04-30	Google Says To Investors: Don't Think Of Flipping	Wall Street loves Google, but the feeling isn't mutual. That is the message permeating nearly every page of the public offering statement that Google Inc., the Web search engine company, filed yesterday. In a frank and provocative statement, the company's leaders argued that companies cannot manage for the long term unless investors and analysts have limited say in the way they are run.
2004-04-30	Excerpts From 'Owner's Manual' Included With Offering	The founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, included in the offering statement a letter -- or, in their words, ''An Owner's Manual'' -- patterned after the annual letters that Warren E. Buffett writes to shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway. Following are excerpts from the Google founders' letter: Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. Throughout Google's evolution as a privately held company, we have managed Google differently. We have also emphasized an atmosphere of creativity and challenge, which has helped us provide unbiased, accurate and free access to information for those who rely on us around the world.
2004-04-30	An Egalitarian Auction? Bankers Are Not Amused	For months, investment banks vied to win the job of underwriting Google's much-anticipated initial public offering. But as details emerged yesterday about the unusual auction process that Google's founders have chosen, questions have arisen about whether the scramble for a piece of the action was worth the trouble. Google hired Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston as underwriters, but it might as well have hired eBay. Gone is the bankers' flashy road show to sell investors on the deal, gone are the complex valuation models that bankers toil on to set the offering price -- and gone are the high fees. Executives close to the deal said the banks would get a fee of about 3 percent, or $81 million, of the total offering. Though not small change, that is down from the 7 percent they typically charge -- in this case $189 million.
2004-04-30	Adding Broad Technology Skills in an Informal Setting	When Eric E. Schmidt arrived to run Google in 2001, the joke in Silicon Valley was that the company was finally going to get some ''adult supervision.'' At the time, neither Sergey Brin nor Larry Page, the company's co-founders, had much formal work experience in the technology industry besides the work they were doing at Google, which they started in 1998. Both were officially on leave from Stanford University's graduate program in computer science.
2004-04-27	Google Is Said To Pick Bankers To Lead Its I.P.O.	Frank P. Quattrone, the former investment banker, may be on trial for obstruction of justice in a federal courtroom in Lower Manhattan, but in Silicon Valley his spirit as the prime deal maker for the digiterati is still alive and well. Mr. Quattrone's legacy was officially cemented yesterday as the two firms that he built into technology banking powerhouses in the 1990's boom, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley, emerged as Google's choice to lead the underwriting of an eagerly sought initial public offering. The offering is scheduled to be announced this week, executives close to the planned deal confirmed.
2004-04-26	To Silicon Valley	" a Sign of Things Improving"",""From everyman investors to technology executives, the inhabitants of Silicon Valley are expressing strong, but sharply mixed, reactions to reports that the long-anticipated Google public offering may be imminent.

2004-04-26	A Quirky Brilliance vs. the Dreams of Venture Capitalists	Not every company would coyly spurn billions of dollars and front-page attention. Yet Google seems intent on staying private as long as possible despite the clamoring of investors to own a piece of a company that has become synonymous with instant information on the Web. There are many good reasons to avoid a public stock offering and the close scrutiny it brings. Indeed, this week the scrutiny will intensify as the company approaches a deadline to file financial disclosures. But in Google's case, its hesitancy up to this point has been a symptom of a long-running battle for control between its two brainy, headstrong founders and the powerful, strong-willed financiers who gave them the money to turn their graduate school project into one of the world's leading brands, according to several people in and outside Google.

All can be counted among that small club of people lucky enough to own a sliver of Google, one of the hottest companies in Silicon Valley and what could be the hottest deal on Wall Street this year. Michael S. Ovitz, once a top Hollywood agent, pulled strings in an effort to enter a pool that was being offered to a group of rich investors and would eventually own a small piece of Google. But that was in the late 1990's, and apparently his star was already fading. Mr. Ovitz was turned away.
2004-04-24	Google Flirts; Investors Wonder About Date	Google, the Web search company that has developed a huge following around the world, is expected to take a tentative first step next week toward a public stock offering, a person close to the company said Friday. But it is likely to stop short of filing a formal registration to sell shares, the person said. In recent days speculation on Wall Street and Silicon Valley has reached a fever pitch over Google's long-awaited offering, which has become the most highly anticipated event in the technology world here since the dot-com boom collapsed in early 2000.

The move follows Yahoo's introduction last month of SmartView, which allowed it to get a jump on Google by creating a service for Web users that permits enhance searches limited to a local area. Google echoed that move days later when it started Google Local, a product that even company executives acknowledge is still a work in progress.

2004-04-08	In Google We Trust? When the Subject Is E-Mail	" Maybe Not"",""AT first, people thought it was an April Fool's joke last week when Google, the search-engine leader, announced plans to offer a free Web-based e-mail service. One thing that made the plan seem unbelievable was the huge amount of free storage offered: a gigabyte, several hundred times more space than most Web-based e-mail services offer. More incredible still to many people was what Google planned as its part of the bargain: to send advertisements to subscribers tailored to the contents of their incoming e-mail, which would be combed by special software. A message from a friend suggesting a Maui vacation might be accompanied by an advertisement for, say, discounted Hawaii-bound flights."

It will be ''soft launched,'' they said, in a manner that Google has followed with other features that it has added to its Web site, with little fanfare and presented initially as a long-running test.
2004-03-21	Corrections	An article last Sunday about the popularity of the Internet search engine Google and its effect on the broader culture referred imprecisely to the founding of Google Inc. by two Stanford University doctoral students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The two began collaborating on a search engine in 1995 and eventually set up a data center in a Stanford dormitory; when the company was officially founded in 1998, it opened in an office in a garage. (It was not founded in the dorm in that year and subsequently moved to the garage.) The article also misstated the title of Susan Wojcicki. She is Google's director of product management, not product placement.

But Google, which last year surged ahead of Yahoo to become the No.1 site for searching on the Internet, disdains the practice as misleading.

2004-02-27	Editorial Observer; Behind the Rise of Google Lies the Rise in Internet Credibility	For the past few months, it has seemed as if every week has brought more news about Google, the search engine invented in the mid-1990's by a couple of Stanford graduate students. Microsoft has offered, in vain, to buy the company and is now developing its own proprietary search engine, in part by looking for soft spots in Google's patents. Yahoo has introduced a Google-like search tool of its own and dumped Google's. Meanwhile everyone is waiting for Google's initial public offering, an event that many people hope will begin a new round of I.P.O.'s, a round that carries us back in equity and optimism to the late great tech bubble at the end of the last century. Microsoft and Yahoo want their share and more of the nearly $1 billion in ad revenue that Google generates. Investors want their share and more of Google stock. Most of the rest of us -- at some 200 million searches a day -- just want to keep Googling. An early form of Google became available to Internet users in late 1998. Its rise to dominance in the search business came about for a number of reasons. One is the quality -- expressed as relevance -- of the search results it yields, quality that depends in part on the sophistication of Google's search algorithm but also on the sophistication of its users, who are growing wilier all the time.

Google said that it had added nearly one billion pages to its Web index for a total of 4.28 billion pages. Yahoo declined to say how many pages are in its index. Yahoo's move is the first shot in what it hopes will be an assault on Google in several search-related areas. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2004-02-09	Social Networks: Will Users Pay To Get Friends?	The idea behind ''social networking'' Web sites like Friendster, Tribe.net and LinkedIn is almost the opposite of the old Groucho Marx joke: they attract people who want to join a club eager to have them. But as the popularity of such sites has taken off, the big question for investors in new technologies is whether social networking sites can ever make a lot of money by connecting friends of friends in mini-networks of trust, whether for dating, business or maintaining acquaintances. For many, the buzz over social networking sounds a lot like vintage Internet hyperbole from the late 1990's.
2004-02-08	Editors' Note	An article last Sunday described the coming battle between Google and Microsoft over the Internet search business. It quoted Nancy Blachman, a computer scientist, as saying that Google had an advantage in the race because it had the most current users. The article also identified Ms. Blachman as the author of an independent guide to using Google but should have noted that Ms. Blachman, though not affiliated with that company, is married to a Google software engineer.
2004-02-02	Compressed Data; Google Protests Give Web Site an Audience	No doubt about it: the search site looks an awful lot like Google, with its spare design and brightly colored letters. But the name is Booble, and it is a search engine for sex sites. Along with the name, another clue to its bawdy nature can be found in the lewd liberties taken with the double O in the logo, which to reprint in a family newspaper would require pasties. Google, claiming trademark infringement, sent a cease and desist letter to the operators of the Booble site.

The report is a crucial step in Google's carefully staged path toward an initial public offering that is expected to take place this spring. Google's board has been awaiting the report before giving the final go-ahead for the company to file a formal stock registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to several executives involved with the process.

The market for initial public offerings has languished of late, with fewer than 100 in each of the last three years, including 2003. But in 2004, analysts expect as many as 150 companies to go public -- roughly half of them technology related. But do not expect a replay of 2000, when there were nearly 400 initial offerings, most of them by technology companies. This time, investors are likely to expect profitability to be on a stock issuer's résumé, said Richard J. Peterson, chief market strategist with Thomson First Call."

Although the experiment, called Google Print, was begun quietly earlier this month, the company described its test on Wednesday in general terms after Google users began noticing the content in their information searches. Google executives were quick to point out that the company now considers the service to be a test, or ''beta,'' version, and it is not generating revenue from either the search information or from ads or other related information that appear on the retrieved pages.

2003-12-01	Waiting in Silicon Valley	In Silicon Valley, the Realtors can't wait. The nation's high-technology region has become obsessed with the impending initial public offering of Google, the leading Internet search engine. A flurry of press reports suggest that the company will go public some time between January and April of 2004, and prospects for the company's valuation have been reported as high as $25 billion. Google executives would not comment, but the company, according to reports, is considering a so-called Dutch auction, bypassing Wall Street and selling shares directly to investors, a route that would distance it from the investment bank scandals of the dot-com era. The second question on everyone's minds is whether Google will become the next Netscape, another highflying Silicon Valley Internet company whose business was undermined when Microsoft added a browser to its operating system.

Mr. Perkins recently sent an e-mail message to the members of his Web site that began, ''I have just decided to write a book about Google.'' Google, approaching its initial public offering, is the hottest of hot business topics, and the idea of writing a book about it is no surprise. But the way he proposed writing it was unusual. The work is to be a collaboration among his readers who ''are encouraged to post their thoughts and reflections on what I write in this ongoing blog on Google,'' he said, adding, ''The goal is to work with A.O. members to write a book that gets published before Google goes public.''

The project is collecting and indexing 25 million Web pages a day, about 4 billion pages this year, half of them stored in I.B.M. databases. Those not stored include Web pages not likely to be relevant to I.B.M.'s business customers, like the 30 percent of all Web pages that feature pornography. Robert Carlson, a vice president in the company's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., said the technology goes well beyond the text searches and popularity ranking of Google.

With Phonebook, Internet users can type a phone number into the Google search box. If the number is listed publicly, chances are that the name and address of the person to whom it belongs will appear. One more click conjures a map and driving directions to the home or business.
2003-04-07	Yahoo Plans Improvements in Effort to Regain Lost Ground	Can Yahoo find the ground it lost in the search business? In 1999, Yahoo gave a small company its first big break, hiring it to provide results for its Internet search service. By last year, that company, Google, had usurped Yahoo as the No. 1 site for World Wide Web searches.
2003-03-05	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Google Introduces New Ad Service	Google Inc., the Internet search engine company, is introducing a service that sells and delivers selected ads on outside Web sites. The company already sells ads for other sites, but it said yesterday that its new system automatically identifies the content of participating Web pages and sends relevant ads to each one. Companies including HowStuffWorks Inc. and Knight Ridder Digital, which includes the sites for newspapers like The Detroit Free Press and The Philadelphia Inquirer, have signed up to sell ad space through the new service. The move furthers a push by Google, of Mountain View, Calif., into the online ad sales business.
2003-02-24	Deal May Freshen Up Google's Links	Google's recent purchase of Pyra Labs, creators of the Blogger service for publishing the online soapboxes known as Weblogs, was a happy ending for a much-loved startup that at times seemed on the edge of collapse. But people who follow Weblogs are curious about what Google, the world's leading search engine, expects to gain from the deal.
2003-02-17	Google Deal Ties Company To Weblogs	Google, the operator of the Web's leading search engine, has bought Pyra Labs, the creator of software for publishing Weblogs, a form of hyperlinked online journal that has become an increasingly popular way to distribute and collect information on the Web. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the move was hailed by users of Weblogs, commonly called blogs, as a watershed moment for the fledgling communications medium, sometimes dismissed as too narrowband and self-involved to have a significant cultural impact.
2003-02-10	E-Commerce Report; Unscrupulous advertisers are said to outbid reputable merchants for top billings in online searches.	TOP online merchants have advertised extensively on search sites like Google, Yahoo, MSN and AOL, buying their way to prominence. But analysts and executives say that reputable advertisers increasingly find themselves outbid for top search listings by unscrupulous and perhaps fraudulent e-tailers. Executives for the search services say they weed out the bad actors when they are made aware of them, but critics say the search sites are not aggressive enough.
2003-01-06	Seeking Market Clarity	The battle among the top Web search sites for the United States audience has grown fiercer, and more complex, with the recent announcement that Yahoo plans to buy Inktomi, a Web search technology company, for $235 million in cash. One of Yahoo's main competitors is Google, which besides operating its own popular search site, competes with Inktomi in offering search technology to other companies. Inktomi's clients include MSN.com, Overture, About.com and Looksmart. Among Google's clients are AOL Properties, Ask Jeeves, Netscape and here is where things get interesting Yahoo itself. Both Inktomi and Google, meanwhile, do business with HotBot, the search service owned by Lycos.
2002-12-19	ONLINE DIARY	Clickable Countdowns Online Advent calendars that count down from Dec. 1 to Christmas are popular holiday destinations. Two of the best are not overtly religious and will appeal to anyone looking for seasonal cheer, not to mention Web graphics. The Q Creative Calendar (www.q-creative.com), in its fifth year, is the work of a freelance designer, Susan J. Preston. (The site is named for her business.) Its December run has become an annual event for thousands of visitors.
2002-12-15	Is Googling O.K.?	My friend went on a date last week and ''Googled'' the man when she got home -- that is, looked him up on the Internet search engine google.com. She found that he had been involved in many malpractice suits. (He's a doctor.) Her ''homework'' has now resulted in a discounted opinion of this man. What do you think about using Google to check up on another person? Shana Novak, New York I'm for it, but then again I have to be: I've done it. And many other people have, too; that's why the verb ''to Google'' is now a familiar neologism. (It must demoralize those poor souls at AOL, with all their child-proofing and spam and ads, that no one ever says, ''I met an interesting guy and AOL'ed him.'') Had your friend labored all afternoon at the courthouse checking equally public information on her date, she'd have crossed the border between casual curiosity and stalking. Her Googling, however, was akin to asking her friends about this fellow -- offhand, sociable and benign.
2002-12-13	New Test Site From Google Focuses on Products for Sale	Google, the ever-expanding search engine, has entered one of the most competitive corners of Web searching, online shopping, with a test site called Froogle. One of the main uses of general search sites like Google is to look for things to buy. But the new service focuses specifically on products for sale, displaying pictures of the items and their prices at various merchants. It lets users narrow a search by the category of product and the price.

2002-10-25	Study Tallies Sites Blocked By Google	Google, the popular Internet search engine, has excluded more than 100 Web sites from the French and German versions of its index under pressure from those nations' governments, a new study has found. The sites include many devoted to white supremacist philosophy and Nazism, with names like Jew Watch. Ben Edelman, who did the research, said ''they are mostly pretty terrible pages.''
2002-10-10	Guerrilla Warfare	" Waged With Code"",""WHEN the reports started trickling out in early September, they were met with disbelief and then outrage among technophiles. The Chinese government had blocked its citizens from using the popular search engine Google by exercising its control over the nation's Internet service providers. The aggressive move surprised Nart Villeneuve, a 28-year-old computer science student at the University of Toronto who has long been interested in Chinese technology issues. Blocking one of the most popular sites on the Internet was a far cry from Beijing's practice of restricting access to the Web sites of dissident groups or Western news organizations."
2002-09-24	All the News Google Algorithms Say Is Fit to Print	Google, the rapidly growing online search engine, introduced a service yesterday that uses its search algorithms -- but no human editors -- to create a news page that looks not much different from those of many news Web sites. ''We are trying to leverage the experience of all the editors out there,'' said Larry Page, Google's co-founder and president for products. The site brings together headlines, and makes its automated news judgments, from information appearing on 4,000 sites.
2002-09-14	China Seems To Refine Bid To Restrict Web Access	The Chinese authorities appear to have refined their attempts to block access to popular United States-based Internet search engines, people who use the Web in different parts of the country said today. Users said they could once again reach Google, which had been barred for almost two weeks, although Altavista, another popular American search site, remained inaccessible. But now the authorities, shifting strategies, appear to be selectively blocking access to specific Google content.
2002-09-12	China Toughens Obstacles to Internet Searches	Some Chinese Internet users seeking the popular search engine Google today instead are now instantly routed to GlobePage, which calls itself the ''premier Asian search engine.''

It is run by China Telecom, the dominant fixed-line phone and Internet company.
2002-09-04	Beijing Blocks Access to Google	China has blocked access to the popular Internet search engine Google as the government tightens media controls before a shift in leadership expected in November.

2002-08-22	ONLINE DIARY	Blog Nation The number of Weblogs now tops a half-million, by most estimates. So it's no surprise that some bloggers, as the writers of these link-filled, diarylike sites are known, are carving some order out of chaos. There is no easy way to search for blogs by content or popularity. The major blog directory, at portal.eatonweb.com, has only 6,000 listings. But a bevy of new sites offer interesting ways, if somewhat esoteric ones, to browse the blog universe.
2002-05-02	AOL Shifts Key Contract To Google	America Online said yesterday that it had chosen Google to provide Web search results and the advertisements that appear next to them. The decision will increase Google's already healthy share of the search market and give its advertising program a stronger foothold. Google is replacing two incumbents, the search engine Inktomi and the ad provider Overture Services, which will continue to place ads on AOL services in Europe. The news sent Overture's stock plunging 36 percent, to $21.99, while Inktomi's shares dropped 24 percent, to $1.76.

The study was conducted by the StatMarket unit of WebSideStory. The firm said the next most-used service was MSN, which fielded 12.73 percent of requests. Andrew Zipern (NYT)"
2002-04-22	New Economy; A copyright dispute with the Church of Scientology is forcing Google to do some creative linking.	GOOGLE, the company behind the popular Web search engine, has been playing a complicated game recently that involves the Church of Scientology and a controversial copyright law. Legal experts say the episode highlights problems with the law that can make companies or individuals liable for linking to sites they do not control. And it has turned Google, whose business is built around a database of two billion Web pages, into a quiet campaigner for the freedom to link.

2002-04-04	Upstart Search Engines Try to Topple Google	GOOGLE looks like the king of search engines these days. Critics rave, new visitors have turned the site into one of the Web's top destinations, and many longtime users say they are thrilled with the site's new services, like image and news-group searching. But that is not stopping a couple of new companies, and at least one older search site, from trying to dethrone the ruler.
2002-03-22	Technology Briefing | Internet: Google Removes Anti-Scientology Links	Google Inc. said it had removed some links to an anti-Scientology Web site from its popular search engine this week after the Church of Scientology told it that the linked pages infringed on church copyrights. The pages were part of Operation Clambake (xenu.net), a site based in Norway that is a well-known hub for critics of Scientology. The church cited the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 law that can make it illegal to link to copyright-infringing material. Andreas Heldal-Lund, the owner of Operation Clambake, said the material fell under the fair-use provision of copyright law, and that he would ask Google to restore the links. David F. Gallagher (NYT)
2002-02-21	Technology Briefing | Internet: Google Adds Ad Option	The search engine Google introduced a service in which advertisers that bid for ad position on the results page will get better placement if their ads draw more user responses, or clicks. While advertisers could previously pay only by the number of ads displayed, Google's new service calculates the placement of the paid ads on the basis of both the bid and the click rate. That means an ad with a lower bid that draws more responses can be placed above a more expensive but less compelling link, said Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. Shares of Overture Services, a Google rival, fell $2.80, or 9.6 percent, yesterday as investors assessed the new Google service. But Safa Rashtchy, a research analyst at Piper Jaffray, played down the threat to Overture. ''It's inconceivable to us that any one of the portals would want to make this deal with Google, because they see Google increasingly as a competitor,'' Mr. Rashtchy said. Glenn Fleishman (NYT)

2002-02-12	Technology Briefing | Internet: Google Enters Corporate World	Google, the search engine company, has started to sell the Google Search Appliance, a device that permits companies to locate documents within their databases. The Google.com Web site has become a popular search service for consumers, but the company has been less active in the corporate search business. Google says the device -- available in two versions, one for $20,000 and the other for $250,000 -- is a plug-and-play solution that takes minutes to install. Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., enters a market with several rivals, including Verity, Ask Jeeves and AltaVista. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
2002-02-07	Technology Briefing | Internet: Earthlink Drops Overture	Shares of Overture Services plunged 41 percent after the Internet search engine lost its contract with EarthLink, an Internet service provider. Shares of Overture, which is based in Pasadena, Calif., slid $12.50, to $17.92, on word that EarthLink had named Google its search engine after permitting its contract with Overture to lapse. Overture provides a search engine where businesses can pay to have their Web sites listed more prominently in results. EarthLink said it had decided to let its contract with Overture end on Jan. 1 after deciding to expand its relationship with Google.
2002-01-03	ONLINE DIARY	Funny Business What is the world's funniest joke? According to the early results of an Internet-based study run by British scientists, it is as follows: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson go camping. They pitch their tent under the stars and go to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes wakes Watson up, saying, ''Watson, look up at the stars, and tell me what you deduce.'' Watson says, ''I see millions of stars, and if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, it's quite likely there are some planets like Earth, and if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life.'' Holmes replies, ''Watson, you idiot, somebody stole our tent!''

2001-12-20	ONLINE DIARY	History Unearthed There was a search frenzy last week when the Google search engine made available an archive of postings from the Usenet electronic message boards going back to their inception 20 years ago.

2001-12-19	Technology Briefing | Internet: Google Adds Mail Order Catalogs	Printed holiday mail-order catalogs from 600 stores, including L. L. Bean and even Amazon.com, have been digitized and indexed by the search engine company Google at catalogs.google.com. The company developed its own optical character recognition software to turn the type in headlines and product descriptions into searchable computer text, a Google spokesman said. Searches bring up thumbnail images of matching catalog pages, along with full-size excerpts of the pages with the search terms highlighted. The catalogs may also be browsed. Web site links and phone numbers for the stores are displayed along with the results. Google introduced the site without seeking permission from catalog retailers, but the spokesman, David Krane, said it would comply with all requests for removal. None have been received so far, he said. Glenn Fleishman (NYT)
2001-12-12	Technology Briefing | Internet: Usenet Archive Is Posted On Web	The big search engine Google restored decades of the Internet's own history to the World Wide Web by putting an archive of 700 million Usenet newsgroup messages dating back to 1981 online. The archive can be found at www.groups.google.com. Usenet predates Internet domain naming, and emerged alongside e-mail as a method to share messages among a wide community of computer users. Google acquired Usenet archives stretching back to 1995 from Deja.com in February 2001. But earlier postings were not warehoused in any central location. ''There's absolutely no central point of authority,'' said Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google and president for technology. Longtime Internet users helped Google's search for older messages by retrieving long-held CD-ROM's, which Google pieced together. Glenn Fleishman (NYT)
2001-11-07	Technology Briefing | Internet: Search Engine Expands	The top-ranked Internet search engine Google has expanded its index to include material in Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and other business and academic file formats linked from Web pages. The move augments Google's February 2001 addition of Adobe Portable Document Format, or P.D.F., files and brings the search engine's non-Web document total to 35 million. A Google spokesman, David Krane, said P.D.F.'s now account for 22 million of those documents, up from 10 million in February. Google converts these indexed documents to Web pages that can be viewed with standard browsers via a link on its search results pages. Google also now indexes the text of files formatted as PostScript, Rich Text Format, Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPro, and MacWrite, as well as the WordStar 2000 format. Glenn Fleishman (NYT)

2001-07-29	So	" Technology Pros, What Comes After the Fall?"",""THE American economy may or may not be in a recession -- but the information technology industry surely is, with no sign of an upturn. Lately, Silicon Valley, fabled for its invention, its can-do mentality and its dot-com fever, is looking a lot less fabled. For two hours last Monday, four veterans of the valley -- Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive of Intel; Judith L. Estrin, a serial entrepreneur who is now chief executive of Packet Design Inc.; Mitchell E. Kertzman, the chief executive of Liberate Technologies; and Eric E. Schmidt, chairman of Novell and Google, -- met at the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto to discuss the state of the high-tech world. Asking the questions of these executives, who sit on the boards of eight other companies, all told, were John Markoff, Matt Richtel and Judith H. Dobrzynski of The Times."
2001-07-12	A Quick Way to Search For Images on the Web	Is there anything Google can't find? In February the popular search engine announced that it had started indexing millions of portable document format files (identifiable by the suffix .pdf). Now the company has launched Google Image Search, a nifty new tool that lets you search for the pictures embedded in Web pages. Scouring more than 150 million images, Image Search (images.google.com) turns up some real gems. For example, it found more than 2,500 images in a search for ''Bill Gates,'' including corporate head shots, the mug shot from a 1977 traffic arrest and an image taken seconds after he was hit in the face with a pie a few years ago.
2001-05-17	A Search Engine Goes Beyond Google	THERE seems to be little argument among Web-search gurus that Google is one of the best search engines out there -- if not at the top of the heap. It has won awards from more than a dozen magazines and is now used by Yahoo and Netscape to augment their category-based Web site directories. So, when Danny Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Watch, reviewed a new search engine recently under the headline ''Makes Google Even Better,'' people took notice.
2001-05-07	New Economy; Google's revival of a Usenet archive opens up a wealth of possibilities but also raises some privacy issues.	WITH some decent search skills, a bit of free time and a degree of skepticism about what one ultimately finds, a person can learn a lot by trolling through an archive of Internet bulletin boards that has once again become available online. In February, the Internet search service Google bought from the failed information site Deja.com an archive of more than 650 million messages posted on electronic bulletin boards, known as Usenet newsgroups, that dates to 1995.
