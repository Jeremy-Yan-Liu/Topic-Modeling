A publicist for Facebook eagerly offered photos afterward of the beaming couple, who met at Harvard and have dated for much of the last nine years. Well-placed anonymous sources leaked to reporters the dinner menu, which included sushi and Mexican food, and the fact that Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong performed.
2012-05-25	Facebook's Brilliant Disaster	So I guess you've heard about the recent initial public offering that didn't turn out the way it was supposed to. The company's Wall Street advisers misjudged the market, and, on its first day of trading, the stock went a little haywire. Then it slowly sank, dropping around 10 percent over the next month. No, I'm not talking about Facebook. I am referring to Splunk, an 8-year-old, money-losing data analytics company that went public five weeks ago. Splunk's investment bankers priced the stock at $17 a share. But it closed its first day of trading at $35.48 -- a gain of 109 percent -- before declining over the next month. (It has rebounded in the last week.)
2012-05-25	DealBook Online	SOURED ASSETS REBOUND The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced on Thursday that Citigroup had won an auction for $1.67 billion of assets of the American International Group, beating out six other financial firms for the bonds. In recent months, big banks have been battling to buy the investment that nearly prompted the collapse of A.I.G., betting that the market for those types of investment has recovered. The latest auction centers on a vehicle known as Maiden Lane III that the New York Fed created as part of the broad bailout of A.I.G.

This week, Mr. Hoag, 63, a property manager in Tennessee, learned from his Scottrade broker that he was being charged $3,805 for the shares anyway, plus a commission fee. When he made a complaint, he was told by e-mail that he would have to go through the compliance office, which typically takes seven to 10 days to respond. These are the days of the runaround for thousands of ordinary investors who were snagged when the much ballyhooed initial offering had problems on Friday.

And if true, many observers are speculating, did that have to do with the terms of a prenuptial agreement? The Zuckerbergs are not saying.

2012-05-20	From a Facebook Founder Comes A Way to Streamline Work Flow	SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook's success has spawned a multimillion-dollar boom in social networking. There are networks for photo-sharers, for children and for workers inside companies. Yammer and Jive, for instance, promise to energize employees and increase their productivity by enabling fast information sharing. Dustin Moskovitz thinks this is a bad idea that won't fly. ''The first time I looked at Yammer, I thought I was on Facebook,'' he said. ''Work is not a social network, with serendipitous communications and photo collections. Work is about managing tasks, and responding to things quickly.''

2012-05-20	All About You	Recently I tried to persuade a friend, a professional woman in her 40s, to create a Facebook account. Like many people, I'm a regular user, usually to post photos and updates of my daughter's sports and academic accomplishments -- and to keep track of friends and family. But my friend believed Facebook would drain her time. She said that if she couldn't maintain friendships in the real world, she wasn't interested in keeping up with the small details of people's lives. There has been a lot of scholarship devoted to the study of Facebook, sparking debate about the mental health and personality traits of frequent users. Most recently, research from Western Illinois University suggested, like other studies before it, that Facebook appeals to our most narcissistic tendencies. The study, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, asked 292 people to answer questions aimed at measuring how self-involved they were.
2012-05-20	Pakistan Blocks Access to Twitter Over Cartoon Contest	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The Pakistani government blocked access to the social networking service Twitter for much of Sunday, after publicly holding Twitter responsible for promoting what it described as a blasphemous cartoon contest taking place on Facebook, officials said. The restoration of Twitter service late in the evening was as sudden as its suspension earlier in the day. No official statement or explanation was given for an act that some rights campaigners saw as much as a warning shot at the media and public expression as a reaction to controversial content.

2012-05-19	After a Lackluster Debut, Facebook Must Prove Itself to Investors	Facebook now has some proving to do. On the first day of trading as a public company, Facebook shares did not deliver the pop that many investors have come to expect from Internet companies. The lackluster first-day performance may be an early sign that the market is not fully comfortable valuing Facebook at $105 billion, a number that assumes the company is capable of producing enormous profits.
2012-05-19	Big Debut Is Marred By Problems At Nasdaq	Friday should have been Facebook's day to shine -- and Nasdaq's as well. Instead it became a glitch-filled market session that raised questions about how Facebook's stock price ended the day as well as how the nation's second-biggest stock market and the underwriters handled the trading debut. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that it would review the day's trading, which included an unexpected delay, missing trade execution messages and at one point, having to fill orders by hand.
2012-05-19	Before Leaping, Listen To a Giant	WHAT are ordinary investors to make of the puzzling swings in Facebook's first-day share price on Friday? Or of the fact that this company, all of eight years old, is now worth more than $104 billion on the stock market? For some perspective, I turned to Harry M. Markowitz, who may have had a greater influence on current theories of finance and investing than any other living person. Mr. Markowitz, a 1990 Nobel laureate in economics, is the father of modern portfolio theory. His advice: Don't worry too much about Facebook's oscillating stock price. Or, for that matter, about gyrations in another big stock in the news, JPMorgan Chase, after the disclosure of a precarious multibillion-dollar hedging strategy.

Young men in shorts and loafers line up on a leatherette sofa, balancing Macs or iPads on their knees, discussing bands or business plans. Some speak French, others English. The lighting is subtle, the ideas sound bright. In a start-up incubator tucked away in an upper floor of an office building in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, several dozen entrepreneurs dream of building the next Google, Facebook or Zynga.

2012-04-24	Technology Giants Take On Google in Patent Deal	SEATTLE - A plan by Facebook to acquire a broad range of patents through a deal with Microsoft is on its surface yet another twist in the battles over intellectual property engulfing the tech business. But the subtext of the deal is a different story, showing how two of technology's most powerful players are teaming up to create a greater balance of power on the Internet - a market that has been tilted decisively in favor of one company, Google, for years. ''This is almost certainly a move against Google,'' said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at Altimeter Group, a research firm. The agreement between Microsoft and Facebook, announced on Monday, came less than two weeks after Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 925 patents held by AOL. In a second deal, Microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents - about 650 in all - to Facebook for $550 million in cash, along with rights to 275 AOL patents Microsoft plans to retain. While Facebook and Microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents, it is expected that Facebook will end up with a range of patents involving mobile, Web and instant messaging technologies. Microsoft is likely to keep AOL patents involving search, among other things. The arrangement will help Facebook bulk up its intellectual property portfolio before its ini tial public offering, which is expected next month, and it is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company. ''This is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests over the long term,'' Ted Ullyot, general counsel of Facebook, said in a statement. The deal could also give Facebook additional ammunition in its escalating patent feud with Yahoo. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming violations of Yahoo patents, many related to online advertising. Facebook subsequently countersued Yahoo, in a pattern that is playing out again and again in different parts of the technology business, especially the mobile phone market. But in large part the deal is evidence of how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated ever closer to each other in part because of a common enemy, Google. Google has menaced Microsoft's business on a number of fronts, including with free online Google applications that compete with Microsoft Office and with Android, a mobile operating system that competes with Microsoft's Windows Phone software. As Facebook has evolved into a Web behemoth, with 900 million active monthly users, Google has become increasingly focused on tamping down the challenge to its business from the social network, introducing Google Plus, a rival social service. Google's big concern is that the bounty of data Facebook has about its users, including their tastes and friend connections, will turn it into a serious rival for online advertising dollars. There is also wide speculation that Facebook will start its own Internet search engine to rival Google. ''Microsoft is simply less concerned about the threat of social to its business than Google is,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, explaining why Microsoft is not concerned about competition with Facebook. ''This may be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' he added. Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, declined to comment. Microsoft has spent the last several years forging deeper connections with Facebook at every turn. Long stymied in its efforts to create an Internet search engine that effectively competed against Google, Microsoft two years ago struck a deal with Facebook to use data from the social network in Microsoft's Bing search engine to create more relevant search results. But the arrangement has not helped dislodge Google from its position of supremacy in Internet search. Years before that, Microsoft tried to acquire Facebook, but the social network's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, rebuffed the offer. Those conversations subsequently led to Microsoft's taking a small stake in Facebook, from which it stands to profit handsomely after the company goes public. In March, Google accounted for 66.4 percent of Internet searches in the United States, unchanged from the same month a year earlier, while Microsoft was in second place with 15.3 percent of the market, according to comScore. Microsoft's Bing search engine also supplies search results for Yahoo, which accounted for 13.7 percent of the search market during March. Microsoft has continued to lose money on Bing, including more than $2.6 billion in operating losses for its online division during its last fiscal year. Some executives within Microsoft have advocated selling Bing to another company, with the idea that a company better focused on the Internet market could pose a more credible challenge to Google, according to severalpeople with knowledge of the discussions who didn't want to be identified talking about internal deliberations.Over a year ago, Microsoft executives sent out feelers to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in acquiring Bing, though the overture was not officially sanctioned by Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, one of these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg declined, saying Facebook had too much else to concentrate on. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook. In its original patent deal with AOL, Microsoft either bought or won the ability to assign about 925 patents and patent applications, along with a license to several hundred other patents AOL did not sell as part of an auction of its intellectual property. If the deal announced Monday clears regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft would still own about 275 AOL patents and retain a license to the 650 patents that Facebook will own. In addition, Microsoft is granting Facebook a license to the 275 AOL patents that it is keeping. Yahoo's legal attack on Facebook came at a sensitive time, as the company nears an expected initial public offering. In a statement, Yahoo said the deal with Microsoft will not deter its lawsuit against Facebook. ''Nothing about today's action changes the fact that Facebook continues to infringe our patents,'' Yahoo said in the statement. ''Companies who purchase patents are often working from a position of weakness and take these actions to strengthen their portfolio. We see today's announcement as a validation of our case against Facebook.'' The deal with Facebook puts Microsoft in an awkward position since it could help strengthen one close partner at the expense of another, Yahoo. ''We are very sensitive to the importance of our relationship with both Facebook and Yahoo,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel said in an interview. ''We have enormous respect for the value of the Yahoo patent portfolio. Yahoo has been an important innovator in the Internet space.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Facebook is likely to reach 500 in April 2012, he writes, and most companies conclude that ""if they are going to be subject to much of the regulation that comes with being public, they might as well just go ahead with an I.P.O. and get the full benefits of being public."""

Facebook apparently had determined that an image the academy had uploaded to its Facebook page ran afoul of its ban on nudity.

As it has grown into the dominant company in Silicon Valley, Google has lost some of its entrepreneurial culture and become a slower-moving bureaucracy, analysts and insiders say, in contrast to Facebook, Twitter and other younger, more agile competitors.

2011-01-19	DealBook Online	GOLDMAN BLINKED Goldman Sachs's decision to offer shares of Facebook only to offshore investors is simple risk management, the Deal Professor says. The risk here can be attributed to the scrutiny that this transaction, and Goldman Sachs in general, is now under. A case by the Securities and Exchange Commission would have been difficult to make, but even the threat of one was too much for Goldman. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF BANK I.P.O. GROWS BankUnited on Tuesday ramped up its plans for an initial public offering, saying it could raise $630 million -- more than double what the bank expected when it first filed for an I.P.O. last year. The offering would cap a quick turnaround for BankUnited and a nice win for the private equity investors who own the bank, including Wilbur Ross and John Kanas, the former head of North Fork Bank. The bank plans to sell four million shares of its common stock, while its investors will sell more than 22 million shares. The bank expects to price each share at $23 to $25.

DAVIDOFF LOWERED EXPECTATIONS Nielsen Holdings, the television ratings and consumer measurement company, is tempering expectations ahead of its initial public offering. According to an amended version of its prospectus, filed on Monday, Nielsen expects to price its shares at $20 to $22. At the midpoint of that range, Nielsen will raise $1.5 billion -- a significant step down from its previous estimate late last year of $2 billion. Under the terms of the deal, underwriters also have the option to buy an additional 10.7 million shares. And if that option is fully exercised, Nielsen will increase its total fund-raising to about $1.7 billion. EVELYN M. RUSLI

On first blush, the answer would appear to be no. After all, in May 2009, the company was valued at $10 billion. Last August, Facebook was valued at $27 billion and now it's $50 billion - for a company with a reported $2 billion in revenue and negligible profits. If General Electric, with 2010 revenue of around $150 billion, traded at a similar multiple of revenue, it would be worth $3.75 trillion instead of $200 billion. Facebook is now considered to be worth more than Time Warner, DuPont and Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley.

The deal makes Facebook now worth more than companies like eBay, Yahoo and Time Warner. The stake by Goldman Sachs, considered one of Wall Street's savviest investors, signals the increasing might of Facebook, which has already been bearing down on giants like Google. The new money will give Facebook more firepower to steal away valuable employees, develop new products and possibly pursue acquisitions - all without being a publicly traded company. The investment may also allow earlier shareholders, including Facebook employees, to cash out at least some of their stakes.

Vuvuzelas aside, this World Cup, which comes to a close Sunday with the final match between Spain and the Netherlands, was really not so different than those of the past.

Millions of people used Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, to voice both ecstasy and woe throughout the tournament about their favorite players.

2010-03-14	Friend Request	Last winter, in the middle of my intern year, I became Facebook friends with a young man who was dying in the intensive-care unit. An investment banker in his mid-20s, he thought he was healthy until a fluttering in his chest and swollen ankles took him to a doctor. Now he was in the I.C.U. with a rare cardiac condition and the vague possibility of a transplant. And his laptop. That's the first thing I noticed the morning a group of us stood outside his room on rounds. He was shocked by his internal defibrillator three times the night before -- died, that is, three times before being brought back with jolts of electricity. And this young man with a steroid-swollen face was surfing the Internet.

2009-12-20	Digital Mistletoe	In Limbo, where I've so often spent the holidays, I sat down last year in front of my computer on the night before the night before Christmas and tried to soothe my balsam-scented loneliness by reaching out to my newfound social network (''social networks'' being what we have now in place of ''friends and families''). Outside, in the streets of my snowy Montana hometown, noisy drinkers were strolling from bar to bar as I typed out the sad word ''Facebook'' on my keyboard and scanned my screen for familiar names and pictures. I didn't find many for the simple reason that I was a novice at silicon socializing, and 90 percent of the people I knew on Facebook were people I didn't know at all. The truth was that my social network wasn't mine. The month before, in a rush to join modernity in time for the publication of a new book, I raided the pages of three well-connected colleagues, looking for literary types who might be inclined to accept the overtures of a publicity-hungry writer. The result was a group of more than 300 contacts who were, to me, something between total strangers and high-tech ghosts -- although I did have extensive information about their tastes in books, music and movies.

2009-12-16	Facebook to Monitor Berlusconi Content	MILAN -- Facebook said Tuesday that it would monitor content on its Web site dealing with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy following an attack at a political rally that left him hospitalized. ''Promoting violence, or posting threatening content, is not permitted on Facebook,'' the social-networking site said. ''We will take quick action to respond to reports, and remove any content reported to us that makes direct threats against an individual.''
2009-12-16	Russians Buy Stake in U.S. Web Games	The Russian firm that invested more than $200 million in Facebook this year is making another bet on the United States Internet industry. Digital Sky Technologies, or D.S.T., an investment firm with offices in Moscow and London, is leading a group that is buying a $180 million stake in Zynga, a fast-growing San Francisco company whose online games, like FarmVille, Café World and Mafia Wars, are extremely popular on Facebook.

2009-12-14	Viruses That Leave Victims Red in the Facebook	Viruses are rampaging through social networking sites, sending out humiliating messages to friends and followers.
2009-12-14	Beyond Twitter And Hash Tags	Twitter and Facebook offer social networks for conversation about almost anything. But one feature they don't offer is the ability to engage in conversations with a select group, either based on a location or a specific event. Some Twitter users have tried to remedy this problem by using hash tags. Under the hash tag system, people add a hash or pound symbol (#) before a keyword that is used as an index term for messages on that topic. For example, if I were at a Britney Spears concert (not that I ever have been), I could create a group discussion by appending #britneyspears to my messages. Others at the event could search Twitter for this hash tag and find all concertgoers' messages tagged with it.
2009-12-13	Social Networks as Foreign Policy	In August, after the suppression of Iran's pro-democracy protests, officials in Tehran accused Western governments of using online social networks like Twitter and Facebook to help execute a ''soft coup.'' The accusation wasn't entirely off-base. In Iran and elsewhere, this year showed the growing importance of social networks to U.S. foreign policy. Long before the protests in Iran started, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. civilian international broadcasting, had in place software to counter censorship in countries like Iran, so people could better access the blogosphere. And the State Department financially supports agencies that make it easier for Iranians and others to surf the Web. After the protests began, the State Department asked Twitter to reschedule a maintenance outage so the activists could continue to spread the word about their movement.

2009-12-10	Facebook's Privacy Changes Draw More Scrutiny	Since I wrote about Facebook's privacy changes on Wednesday, there has been more criticism of some of the changes. While Facebook has given people more refined controls over who can see particular pieces of information they post, one controversial move is that several pieces of data are now visible to all members on the service: your name, city, gender, photograph, the profile pages you are a fan of, and your list of friends.

2009-12-07	How Friends Proliferate	Facebook has been on the receiving end of some heavy criticism this year for an array of privacy concerns and a perceived desire to look and act more like Twitter. Some of these concerns are valid, and some are just the growing pains of a five-year-old company in a market that continues to change and adapt at breakneck speeds. All of that aside for a moment, Facebook has one important, underutilized feature that no other site can replicate or compete with: the ''mutual friends'' list.
