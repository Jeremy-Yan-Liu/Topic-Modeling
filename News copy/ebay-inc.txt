7/17/2007	Corrections	An article on July 7 about Bridgeville, Calif., which is up for sale for the third time in five years, referred incorrectly to the role eBay played in the town's sale the first two times. The town was advertised on the Web site's real estate auction site; it was not auctioned off or otherwise sold through a typical eBay transaction between buyers and sellers, or ''through the impulsive rush of online bidding.'' The article also referred incorrectly to two aspects of the town's history. Although Bridgeville is in Northern California, where the Pony Express ended, the town was not a stop on the route. Also, the town was founded in the early 1870s, in the wake of the gold rush; it was not ''an important stop on the wagon trail connecting San Francisco to Eureka'' during the gold rush, which was over by the mid-1860s.

But the federal antitrust laws apply to competition on Internet auctions as much as to physical auctions. Agreements between bidders not to bid against one another or to bid at certain prices are criminal violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Scott D.

4/20/2006	ROOM TO IMPROVE	Q. How do I make furniture I inherited look contemporary? A. Congratulations on not ditching the heirlooms, even though they may not reflect your taste. I also approve of your attempt to figure out how to meld them with your dcor. Too many people, myself included, avoid taking possession of heirlooms for a variety of reasons, only to regret deacquisitioning them at a garage sale or in an auction. The good thing about a traditional piece, whether it is a bona fide antique or merely old-fashioned in style, like the Martha Washington chair by Ethan Allen, is that its lines are often strong enough to handle a new wardrobe. (The chair is $499 at Ethan Allen stores; for locations, 888-324-3571 or ethanallen.com.)

3/28/2006	EBay at the Bar	The Supreme Court hears arguments tomorrow in a bitter patent dispute between eBay and a small company called MercExchange. The court is being asked to decide whether MercExchange -- which holds a patent that, according to a court decision, eBay has infringed -- should be able to get an injunction to close part of eBay's site. For technical reasons of patent law, and policy reasons, the court should rule for eBay. The courts have held that MercExchange's patent is being infringed by eBay's ''Buy It Now'' feature, which allows items to be sold on eBay at a fixed price. EBay insists that the Patent and Trademark Office was wrong to grant MercExchange the patent, and the office has recently indicated that it may invalidate the patent. But for now, the patent is valid. The question is whether MercExchange can get an injunction to force eBay to stop infringing -- perhaps by forcing it to shut down the ''Buy It Now'' feature. If that happens, MercExchange would be in a much stronger position to extract a large financial settlement from eBay.
3/27/2006	Justices Will Hear Patent Case Against eBay	The United States Supreme Court will hear arguments on Wednesday in a protracted, closely watched patent case that pits a small company called MercExchange against eBay, the online auction and marketplace. While the grounds in the case appear narrow -- the court will reconsider the rules under which courts grant injunctions against a company found to be infringing another's patent -- it has attracted enormous attention because of the public rancor between the two companies, the supporters enlisted by both sides and the growing issue of how large technology companies deal with the constant threat of patent challenges.
3/25/2006	Travel Deals Lost in the Details	THERE is a reason some of the deals on the auction travel Web sites sound too good to be true, Budget Travel reports. While outright fraud is rare in the offerings posted by the three companies that dominate the travel auction scene -- SkyAuction, LuxuryLink and, of course, eBay -- in the rush to claim a good price, a buyer may not notice handling fees, blackout dates and penalties for changes that can be buried in the fine print.
3/12/2006	The Silver Is Antique, Though the Search Isn't	IN ''The Merchant of Venice,'' the prince of Arragon chooses the silver casket and finds inside only ''the portrait of a blinking idiot.'' Call me what you will -- silver is still my favorite metal. Gold is too yellow and definitely too tacky for knives and forks and water pitchers. Platinum is all right for jewelry, but the things made with it are often a trifle delicate. Very old pewter has a certain charm, and so does nickel -- especially in faucets -- but when it comes down to it, there is nothing like antique silver.
3/11/2006	On the Internet, Some Home Buyers Find a House of Cards	For the last few years, real estate transactions over the Internet -- where buyers need never set eyes on the property they purchase -- have become increasingly common. On eBay, the biggest online marketplace, and dozens of other Web sites with names like Bid4Assets.com and Realestatesupermarket.com, sales involving tens of thousands of dollars can occur entirely online. EBay, for example, may have more than 1,800 residential properties listed on any given day -- from multimillion-dollar vacation houses in Florida to thousand-dollar fixer-uppers in the rural Midwest.
2/22/2006	Arts, Briefly; 'Brokeback' Shirts Fetch Six Figures	The two iconic shirts from the final scene of ''Brokeback Mountain,'' which was nominated for eight Academy Awards, sold for a staggering $101,100.51 to a Hollywood collector, after an auction on eBay on Monday night. In the Ang Lee film, and the Annie Proulx short story on which it is based, the shirts symbolize the thwarted love of the ranch hands Jake and Ennis. They were dirty from sweat and blood, and tucked one inside the other. The Los Angeles collector Tom Gregory won the bidding, which quickly reached the tens of thousands of dollars from an initial price of $9.99. ''It's a great prop; it's the ruby slippers of our time,'' Mr. Gregory said in an interview. ''It represents the love that would never go away no matter how much the world tried to push it away.'' He said he would leave the shirts, donated by Focus Features, on the hanger they share and frame them either for his home, or for a gay and lesbian foundation with which he is connected. The proceeds from the auction will benefit the Variety Children's Charity Auction. SHARON WAXMAN
2/12/2006	Editors' Note	A front-page article on Jan. 29 about allegations of fraud on eBay referred to complaints that pieces of costume jewelry labeled Weiss, of value to collectors if authentic, were often counterfeit. (The Weiss jewelry company went out of business in 1971.) One buyer said she had had a set of brooches examined by an independent appraiser who judged them fake. The seller was not named in the article, but other details indicated her identity. In fairness, The Times should have sought her response. The seller, Sabrina Lefler of Draper, Va., who has agreed to be identified, said last week that she had bought the jewelry from various sources, assuming it to be genuine, but noted that her eBay listing of the items had not guaranteed their authenticity. She also said she was not convinced that the pieces appraised as fake were ones she had sold. The article also referred imprecisely to the lot involved in the transaction. The $360 price was for 58 pieces, including two brooches signed Weiss, not for Weiss-labeled pieces alone.

At 34, he says he is too young to retire. Philanthropy is a bit staid. Starting another Web-based venture is hardly a challenge, not for a man who bought the idea for PayPal, built it up and then sold it to eBay for $1.5 billion. In seeking a new direction in life that would be as ambitious as his dreams, Mr. Musk has picked a doozy: cheap and reliable access to space.
1/29/2006	Seeing Fakes, Angry Traders Confront EBay	A year ago Jacqui Rogers, a retiree in southern Oregon who dabbles in vintage costume jewelry, went on eBay and bought 10 butterfly brooches made by Weiss, a well-known maker of high-quality costume jewelry in the 1950's and 1960's. At first, Ms. Rogers thought she had snagged a great deal. But when the jewelry arrived from a seller in Rhode Island, her well-trained eye told her that all of the pieces were knockoffs.

They were a present from a well-meaning aunt to our 7-year-old son, who, unfortunately, had outgrown his ''Star Wars'' phase a few years before. I knew they sold for over $100 each at retail, so I didn't want to toss them or give them away. Why not try eBay?
1/11/2006	A Perk for Friends of the Police, Now on eBay	By tradition, New York police officers have bestowed union membership cards upon relatives and friends to distinguish them as people with a special connection to a police officer and deserving of a courtesy. Although the cards have been circulated largely among members of the law enforcement community and influential people, like politicians, an increasing number of cards are being sold on eBay and winding up in outsiders' hands.
12/19/2005	Small Internet Retailers Are Using Web Tools to Level the Selling Field	AMAZON, Walmart.com and other online retailing giants have always had upstarts nipping at their heels. But the little guys are starting to bite harder. Just how sharp their teeth are, however, is a matter of some debate.
12/18/2005	When PayPal Becomes the Back Office, Too	WHEN C. J. Liu bills her clients, all it takes is a few mouse clicks, and for the most part their payments end up in her bank account a few days later. She does not need an assistant to send out invoices or to track accounts payable and receivable. She never has to wait for checks to arrive in the mail, and she does not have to visit the bank. Like many others who run small businesses, Ms. Liu, who offers business and personal coaching in Seattle, is a PayPal customer.
12/1/2005	Hooked On the Web: Help Is on the Way	THE waiting room for Hilarie Cash's practice has the look and feel of many a therapist's office, with soothing classical music, paintings of gentle swans and colorful flowers and on the bookshelves stacks of brochures on how to get help. But along with her patients, Dr. Cash, who runs Internet/Computer Addiction Services here in the city that is home to Microsoft, is a pioneer in a growing niche in mental health care and addiction recovery.
11/29/2005	Justices Agree to Consider EBay Appeal in Patent Case	The Supreme Court accepted an appeal by eBay Inc. in a closely watched patent case on Monday and agreed to revisit the rules under which courts grant injunctions against a company found to be infringing another's patent. A federal court jury in Norfolk, Va., found in 2003 that eBay, the online auction house, was violating three patents owned by MercExchange, a small company in Great Falls, Va. The jury assessed more than $25 million in damages.
11/14/2005	EBay Expected to End Fees for Third-Party Developers	EBay is expected to announce Monday that it is ending the fees it charges software developers who build Web sites and software programs that channel buyers and sellers its way. The move could help eBay protect its dominance of online auctioneering from an encroachment by Yahoo or Google.
11/14/2005	He Made His Money On a Whim, but Now He's Got a Serious Idea	WHEN the Web site that he started on a whim, HOTorNOT.com, a meeting site popular with 20-year-olds, unexpectedly made James Hong a millionaire, he wanted to donate some of his newfound wealth toward good causes. But he wasn't sure how much he should give: 5 percent of his income? $5,000? $50,000? He was not religious, so he didn't have any tithing guidelines to fall back on. Nor did his Chinese-American parents pass down a strong philanthropic tradition, partly because they had grown up poor in rural Taiwan scavenging peanut fields for leftover scraps.
11/14/2005	Building Better Schools, One Glue Stick at a Time	Learning to Love Books -- ''Many of my young students have never even picked up a book. I, together with you, have the opportunity to give my students their first impressions of books and reading. I want these early experiences to be filled with high quality literature in a variety of genres from ABC and counting books to compelling storybooks.'' (A $453 proposal from Chicago.) Glue Sticks Needed -- ''I am a second-grade teacher to 26 wonderful children in the Bronx. We are always doing activities that require us to use glue. Parents have bought some of their children glue, but the glues are liquid glues. Every time we do activities we spend more time in cleanup than doing actual activity. Glue sticks are more convenient for class activities, but don't last as long. I think the time they save in the classroom is worth it.'' (A $147 proposal.) DonorsChoose.org lists thousands of requests from teachers. Just as eBay has changed the world of selling, DonorsChoose is trying to change how people give to education: click on the Web site and there, organized by category, geography and price, are thousands of proposals describing what teachers want for their classrooms and why.
11/6/2005	Table Manners	If only a dinner party involved just food -- how much easier life would be! If only we were cave people once more and could tear into communal meals with our hands, merrily jumping into the nearest brook afterward to cleanse ourselves en masse. Alas, it's not that simple, as I learned when I registered for my wedding several years ago (with extreme reluctance, as this convention of appearing to invite gifts rather than people has always seemed tremendously tacky to me). Then someone pointed out that if we didn't register, we'd wind up with 100 nonreturnable ornamental bowls; that startled me into action. I was urged to choose a china pattern, to select silverware -- or, rather, stainless-steel-ware. (Is there anyone on earth who still polishes silver?) The size of our guest list forced me to consider, and eventually accept, packages filled with accouterments that I had never before dined with at home. Place mats. Candleholders. Cloth napkins. (Hitherto, for myself, I had not been above using a spare roll of toilet tissue to blot the grease from a takeout pizza.) Soon the two cupboards of our tiny Brooklyn railroad apartment groaned in protest.
11/4/2005	Tufts Is Getting Gift of $100 Million, With Rare Strings	Pierre M. Omidyar, the founder of eBay, and his wife, Pamela, gave $100 million to Tufts University this week, with some unusual strings attached. The gift, the largest Tufts has ever received, must be invested in organizations that make small loans to poor people in developing countries, a field known as microfinance. Further, Tufts may use only half the income from the investments for itself; the rest must be reinvested in microfinance.
10/20/2005	Quarterly Profit Rises at EBay; It Lightens Forecast for 2006	EBay, the online marketplace, reported yesterday that its net income rose 40 percent in the third quarter and that revenue reached $1.11 billion, driven largely by growth in the United States and German markets. But the company reduced its earnings guidance slightly for the full year because of its recent $2.6 billion acquisition of Skype Technologies, while still increasing its revenue forecast. As a result, eBay shares fell nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading, after gaining $1.59, to $42.01, before the report was released.
9/13/2005	EBay to Buy Skype, Internet Phone Service, for $2.6 Billion	EBay said yesterday that it would buy Skype Technologies, the Internet phone provider based in Luxembourg, for $2.6 billion in cash and stock, a move that eBay hopes will bolster trading on its online auction site. The total value of the deal may grow based on ''potential performance-based consideration'' that could be worth an additional $1.5 billion, eBay said. Though Skype's revenue is expected to grow to about $200 million in 2006, from an estimated $60 million this year, eBay does not expect Skype -- which gives its basic PC-to-PC service away free -- to turn a profit until the fourth quarter next year.
9/13/2005	Are the Latest Big Deals Really a Big Deal?	The big deal is back -- sort of. While Wall Street has been abuzz about a recent run of high-profile mergers and acquisitions, many of them -- including yesterday's $5.8 billion acquisition of Siebel by Oracle, eBay's $2.6 billion buyout of Skype and Wachovia's $3.4 billion acquisition of Westcorp -- happen to be pretty humdrum.
9/9/2005	EBay Is Said to Be in Talks to Buy Internet Phone Company	EBay is in negotiations to acquire Skype Technologies, the Internet phone company that has been the object of much merger speculation, for $2 billion to $3 billion, two people involved in the negotiations said yesterday. The talks are highly tentative and could fall apart, these people said, speaking on the condition that they not be identified because the talks are continuing. These people also noted that Skype has wavered about selling or pursuing an initial public offering and has held merger discussions with the News Corporation and Microsoft only to abandon those talks.
9/7/2005	Pierre Omidyar's Perfect Store Turns 10	Over Labor Day weekend 10 years ago, a programmer named Pierre Omidyar took a chance on an odd little Web site called AuctionWeb. Most of Silicon Valley spent the summer of 1995 dreaming up ways to use a newfangled technology called the Internet. This was his: an auction site that let anyone list an item or place a bid. He wrote the code in his spare bedroom and posted it on his personal home page, which had a whimsical domain name: www.ebay.com. Mr. Omidyar wanted to create a perfect market, something economists had only imagined, where everything sold for its ideal price. He was also a populist. It looked to Mr. Omidyar, who had a ponytail and wore Birkenstocks, as if the freewheeling Internet was being taken over by well-financed dot-coms. He wanted to ''give the individual the power to be a producer as well as a consumer.''
8/18/2005	A Lemonade Stand for the 21st Century	WHAT I didn't take into account, when I unveiled the Great Alphabetization Project earlier this summer, was just how hard it would be to interest my children in helping me organize our eclectic collection of books. Within hours, as piles of novels whose authors' surnames began with the letters E through L littered the floor, my teenage daughters mutinied.
8/15/2005	New Partner For Yahoo Is a Master At Selling	Everything you hear about Jack Ma is improbable. But today, he looks like one of China's smartest high-tech entrepreneurs. Yahoo's far-reaching deal with him on Thursday has turned his company, Alibaba.com, into the largest online operation in China, where Internet use is growing at an explosive pace.
8/11/2005	Luxuries Online, And They're Real	ONLINE shopping exchanges like eBay and Amazon are sort of like the Wild West of fashion, an untamed frontier where you never really know if that Takashi Murakami cherry-print Louis Vuitton bag was originally purchased in the Fifth Avenue boutique or a vendor's stall on Canal Street. This is a sensitive issue for luxury goods executives whose job is to maintain the integrity of labels like Prada, Herms and Tiffany & Company, companies that typically turn up their noses at dealing in used goods, even if they are authentic. Although some companies have resorted to litigation -- Cartier sued Amazon last year for selling what it said were knockoffs of its watches; Tiffany filed a similar action against eBay -- others have begun to consider a secondary market for luxury fashion and accessories, comparable to the concept of ''certified preowned vehicles'' introduced by Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar in the 1990's.
7/29/2005	Arts, Briefly; August Benefits at CBGB	CBGB, the famously grungy 32-year-old rock club on the Bowery that faces possible eviction when its lease expires at the end of August, is having a monthlong series of benefit concerts and an auction on eBay of rock memorabilia to support its campaign to remain in place. The shows, to begin on Tuesday, include a battery of veteran punk and rock bands: the Misfits (Aug. 12), the Dead Boys (Aug. 26 and 27), the Bush Tetras (Aug. 5), Sham 69 (Aug. 28 and 29), Chevelle (Aug. 4), the Gorilla Biscuits (Aug. 14) and the Vandals (Aug. 20). Sting, Motorhead, Elvis Costello and Norah Jones have donated materials for the auction. The club said that the money raised would support its Save CBGB legal defense fund, and if an agreement is reached with its landlord, the nonprofit Bowery Residents' Committee, then the money would be donated to that group. BEN SISARIO
7/21/2005	EBay, With a Global Boost, Beats Wall Street Expectations	EBay, the online marketplace, surprised investors on Wednesday when it reported that earnings rose 53 percent in the second quarter, driven by growth in international business. The report gives eBay a much-needed boost, coming two quarters after it missed Wall Street estimates by a penny, prompting speculation that its heyday was behind it.
7/19/2005	Arts, Briefly; Harry Potter's Latest Battle	Now Harry Potter is taking on the pirates. Two days after the debut of the latest installment in the popular book series, lawyers for the author, J.K. Rowling, said they had already had to defend ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' against copyright infringement. An offer to sell a scanned P.D.F.-file version of the book that was posted on Half.com soon after its release was removed after a lawyer for Christopher Little Literary Agency, which represents Ms. Rowling, contacted the site, which is owned by eBay. The lawyer, Neil Blair, said the agency has been notified of ''a couple of other'' potentially pirated copies of both the print and audio versions of the book and is pursuing them. Compared to legitimate sales of the book, which totaled nine million in Britain and the United States in the first day, the number of violations ''is quite small so far,'' Mr. Blair said. ''But we do take it seriously.''
7/18/2005	Potter Book Sets Record In First Day	Scholastic Inc. said yesterday that an estimated 6.9 million copies of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' were sold in the United States in the first 24 hours the book was on sale, smashing the one-day sales record of 5 million set two years ago by the previous installment in the popular series. But retailers also began to lower their prices almost immediately and in one case offered earlier customers partial refunds, signaling that millions of copies remain available in bookstores, warehouses and used-book outlets.
7/14/2005	Q & A	Going to School By Way of the Net Q. What is involved in taking a college course online? A. Many colleges and universities have distance-learning programs that let you take courses over the Internet, but the experience will vary, depending on the class and the technology used by the school. Some courses may require nothing more than sending in papers written in Microsoft Word by e-mail or copying them onto a special folder on one of the school's file servers, while a computer-science course may require that you install special software on your computer to use for the class.
7/6/2005	Arts, Briefly	EBay Crackdown on Live 8 Pirates Responding to complaints from the recording industry, eBay said yesterday that it had begun removing illegal DVD copies of Saturday's international Live 8 concerts from its Web site, Reuters reported. Although the 10 globe-spanning pop concerts were free to live audiences that totaled more than a million, reports in England said EMI had paid millions of dollars for the rights to release the official DVD of the event, organized by Sir Bob Geldof, right, to pressure world leaders meeting in Scotland to focus on poverty relief. David Martin, director of antipiracy for the British Phonographic Industry, said: ''There are too many people out there who believe music is for stealing, regardless of the wishes of artists and the people who invest in them. Sadly we are not at all surprised by this incident.'' Some of the pirated DVD's were on sale within 24 hours of the end of the concerts and were attracting bids as high as $31 each. In Plain English, Al Jazeera The Arab news network Al Jazeera is planning to introduce an English-language satellite channel, perhaps as early as March, The Associated Press reported. The decision is based on research said to show that some of the one billion English speakers in the world thirst for news from a non-Western perspective. ''We're the first news channel based in the Mideast to bring news back to the West,'' said Nigel Parsons, left, managing director of Al Jazeera International. ''We want to set a different news agenda.'' He said that Americans were curious about its broadcasts, and its executives contend that negative impressions are based on ''irrational and erroneous information.'' Al Jazeera's Web site gets most of its traffic from the United States. Outside North America, the new channel plans to compete with CNN International and BBC World, the two principal English-language satellite news channels. The new station will have its headquarters in Doha, Qatar, and operate broadcast newsrooms in London, Washington and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Bono Wins His Lawsuit Bono is getting his pants back, and his hat and earrings, too. Bono, the frontman for the Irish rock group U2, won a legal battle yesterday for the return of memorabilia from a former stylist for the band, Reuters reported. Bono had sued the stylist, Lola Cashman, for the mementos, which she said had been given to her when she worked with U2 in the 1980's. The circuit civil court in Dublin gave Ms. Cashman seven days to return the items, including a Stetson hat, a pair of black trousers and earrings worn by Bono during the band's Joshua Tree tour in 1987. After listening to two days of testimony, Judge Matthew Deery said, ''The weight of the evidence was entirely against Ms. Cashman in this case.'' Russia Gets 'My Life' By Bill Clinton With publication timed to coincide with Independence Day, 10,000 copies of ''My Life,'' the autobiography by Bill Clinton, below, have been issued in Russia, Agence France-Presse reported. The Russian translation runs to 1,000 pages, said the publisher, Alpina Business Books. Yassen Zassoursky, the dean of the journalism department at Moscow State University, welcomed the book's tone, saying that such frankness was unheard of from Russian politicians. ''In Russia we have no similar book written with such sincerity,'' he said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency. Sparrow, 70, Sings On Turning 70, Mighty Sparrow, the self-proclaimed calypso king of the world, plans to perform tomorrow in Queen's Hall in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, The Associated Press reported. ''If feeling good is an indication of how long one is going to live, then I will be here for a while,'' he said. Mighty Sparrow, whose real name is Slinger Francisco, was born on July 9, 1935, in Grandroy Bay, Grenada, and moved to Trinidad as a child. Ancient Statues Found An uninhabited Greek islet has yielded fragments of ancient statues near the site of a temple once dedicated to the sun god Apollo, Agence France-Presse reported. Greek archaeologists found the statues, dating to 750 to 500 B.C., on the islet Despotiko, near the island of Antiparos in the Cyclades, the Ministry of Culture said. The statues, known as kouroi, depict young men. The best preserved of the three, 21 inches tall, was found intact from the knees up. Another was intact from the chest up, and the third had been rechiseled for use in masonry. All were built into a recently discovered walled complex, where archaeologists also found a drainage system and a tiled floor in ''excellent condition'' as well as a marble basin, a large storage vessel, and pillar bases and fragments. 'Color Purple' Heads For Broadway The musical ''The Color Purple'' has found itself a home on Broadway. Based on the 1983 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Alice Walker, right, and the 1985 Steven Spielberg film, the show is to begin previews at the Broadway Theater on Oct. 25 and have its official opening on Dec. 1. The story follows Celie, a young black Southern woman who rises from poverty and abuse to spiritual joy and self-empowerment. Directed by Gary Griffin, ''The Color Purple'' features music and lyrics by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray. The libretto is by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Marsha Norman ('''Night, Mother''). Casting is to be announced. The show had its premiere last fall at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta. Cynthia Nixon, perhaps best known for her Emmy Award-winning portrayal of Miranda Hobbes on HBO's ''Sex and the City,'' has been signed to star in the Manhattan Theater Club's world premiere production of ''Rabbit Hole,'' a drama about a couple rebounding from an unexpected loss. Written by David Lindsay-Abaire (''Fuddy Meers'') and directed by Daniel Sullivan (''Proof,'' ''Sight Unseen,'' ''Brooklyn Boy'') , ''Rabbit Hole'' is to begin previews at the Biltmore Theater on Jan. 12 and open officially on Feb. 2. Footnote A broken arm suffered in a fall at home will keep the guitar virtuoso Dorado Schmitt from performing in ''The Spirit of Django Reinhardt'' concert on July 27 at Alice Tully Hall. Angelo Debarre will take his place.
6/30/2005	A Used Printer? No, It's a Refurb	If renovated movie palaces are considered cool these days, why not a factory-reconditioned home theater? A refurbished Pioneer 50-inch plasma television with some previous history fetched $3,300 on eBay over Memorial Day weekend, after an auction that opened with a 99-cent bid. Even Pioneer Electronics, which arranged the auction as an experiment, wondered if the frenzied bidding that quadrupled the price in the last hours was just holiday madness, said Russ Johnston, senior vice president for marketing in Pioneer's home entertainment division.
6/26/2005	Soul of Pagliacci, On a Hanger	IN an age when it seems that nothing is deemed worth buying if you can't drop the name of its designer, it is remarkable that Rachel Ashwell, the name behind one of design's most successful brands, should be virtually anonymous. The look made famous by Ms. Ashwell has spawned a world of imitations that is almost risible. Type the brand's name, Shabby Chic, into eBay's search field, and some 7,500 listings come back, few of them with any concrete connection to the business Ms. Ashwell started in California in 1989. She has even changed the name of the business to Rachel Ashwell Shabby Chic to boost her own name recognition and discourage her shabby imitators.
6/24/2005	New EBay Service Aims to Stem Merchant Exodus	EBay started a service on Thursday that helps merchants create online storefronts separate from the eBay Web site while still contributing to the company's bottom line. EBay executives have long recognized the need to stanch the defection of their best customers -- eBay merchants who pay the company any number of fees so they can sell to the tens of millions who browse eBay's marketplace each month.
6/20/2005	Google Said To Plan Rival To PayPal	Google is preparing an online-payment system that would compete with PayPal, according to an online retailer who has been approached by Google to take part in the effort. In addition to representing a direct challenge to eBay, which owns PayPal, the largest Internet payment system, the move signals Google's intention to become much more deeply involved in online commerce.
6/5/2005	What eBay Could Learn From Craigslist	THESE days, triple-digit annual growth rates are rare among major Web sites. Meet that rarity: Craigslist. Exceptional, too, is the ability to draw 10 million unique visitors each month without ever relying on venture capital and equity markets. Or the ability to attain fourth place among general-interest portals without ever spending a penny on marketing.
6/2/2005	EBay Agrees To Purchase Shopping.com	EBay, the online marketplace, said on Wednesday that it had agreed to buy Shopping.com, an online comparison shopping site, for $620 million. The move comes amid a slowdown in eBay's revenue growth, especially in the United States and is seen as a way for the company to increase traffic and sales on its site.
5/24/2005	Middlemen In the Rush To Sell Online; Web Auction Drop-Off Stores Fight Pawnshop Treatment	The pirate statue had 14 days to leave Massapequa, N.Y. And leave it did. The owner of the six-foot-tall resin figure recently took it to the QuikDrop store on Long Island to have it photographed and put up for auction on eBay for 14 days. An online bidder from Utah paid $750 and the store's workers packed it and were preparing to send it last night.
5/1/2005	Take That, Grandpa	Generations of architects have wanted to break out of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's boxes. On May 17, Dirk Lohan will get the chance. His firm bid $2,705 on eBay for the right to smash a window at Crown Hall, a glass and steel masterpiece by Mies (right) at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago which houses the architecture school Mr. Lohan attended (the auction raised money to refurbish the building's skin). ''I think breaking the window will feel great,'' Mr. Lohan said. ''But only because this is the beginning of a new life for the building.'' Mr. Lohan's school days aren't his only connection to Crown Hall -- he is also Mies's grandson. ''I always had a very warm relationship with him,'' Mr. Lohan, 67, said. He denied any Freudian motivations: ''I know other people found him cold and forbidding, but I didn't.'' He said he hadn't yet thought about how he would break the glass. But Patrick Loughran, a fellow Chicago architect and the author ''Falling Glass,'' the architect's bible on how to prevent glass from failing, had advice for Mr. Lohan: ''If he uses a device that has a very small point -- an icepick would work great -- he should have no problem. But because of the nature of glass, if he uses a blunt instrument like a mallet, even a hammer, he might have more trouble. But he might use a hammer anyway, because, like a lot of architects, he is probably going for a little drama.'' FRED A. BERNSTEIN
4/21/2005	EBay's Profit Increases 28% But Fails to Impress Wall St.	EBay, the giant online marketplace, reported Wednesday that profit rose 28 percent in the first quarter and that revenue topped $1 billion for the first time, based largely on strong growth overseas. The upbeat report comes just one quarter after eBay fell a penny short of Wall Street estimates, a disappointment that prompted six analysts to downgrade their recommendations on the stock. EBay's shares have since fallen 36 percent.
4/10/2005	Who Needs Two?	The price of the average ticket for one of last year's 100 top-grossing concert tours, according to Pollstar: $52.39. That's already a lot to pay for eye strain and temporary hearing loss. But for really good seats at really big shows, people will pay a lot more. These were the top prices per ticket paid on eBay as of last week for some of this year's hottest tours. $1,100 Bob Dylan, Beacon Theater, Manhattan, first row $1,050 U2 (above), HP Pavilion, San Jose, Calif., third row $998 Jimmy Buffett, Citizens Bank Park, Philadelphia, first row $950 Cher, Hollywood Bowl, third row $821 Cream, Royal Albert Hall, London, section X3 (furthest from stage)
3/31/2005	EBay Names BBDO To Replace Goodby	EBay said yesterday that it had selected BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, to replace another Omnicom agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, which had worked for eBay since 1999. EBay unexpectedly dismissed Goodby, Silverstein late Tuesday. EBay spent an estimated $80 million last year on advertising in major media, according to TNS Media Intelligence.
3/17/2005	Bidding for a 'Free Ride' to Business School	Dylan Raap knows the value of a full scholarship to business school. He just bought one on eBay for $36,000. ''Actually, I was prepared to pay a little more,'' said Mr. Raap, 26.
3/17/2005	Look Behind the Ticket Brokers' Curtain	EVEN in a town known for the high quality of its amateur theater, a performance like Ella's as the Wicked Witch stood out. The high point for me, as her mother, occurred after the intermission at ''The Wizard of Oz,'' when a green-faced version of Ella appeared in the balcony to point her wand at Dorothy below. My 13-year-old daughter delivered the line ''I'll get you, my pretty!'' with a raspy cackle that carried across the audience to wake her little sister in Row 11.
3/13/2005	Iger Is Said to Be Choice for New Chief at Disney	The board of The Walt Disney Company is expected to announce on Sunday that Robert A. Iger, Disney's president, will replace Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive who is departing next year, according to a person apprised of the board meeting. The board met Saturday night and voted to give Mr. Iger the job after interviewing other candidates. Another candidate, Meg Whitman, the chief executive of eBay, told directors on Friday that she was not interested in replacing Mr. Eisner, according to an eBay spokesman.
3/13/2005	Corrections	An article last Sunday about business challenges facing eBay, the online auctioneer, referred incompletely to the situation of a jewelry seller, R.J. Moore, who said he left eBay last June and moved his online store to a smaller rival because it offered a better deal. EBay says it earlier suspended Mr. Moore from selling on its site. He was suspended after rival sellers accused him of bidding on their products to drive up prices and of failing to pay in auctions he won -- accusations that he denies. He says he was already intending to switch sites.
3/10/2005	Good Things Still Come To Those Willing to Wait	IF you fall far enough behind the curve, every once in a while you may appear, oh so briefly, to be in step with the leaders. That insight, delusional as it may be, struck me not long ago when Apple Computer unveiled the Mac Mini in an attempt to lure the Windows crowd to take a walk on the wilder side. Finally, industry analysts cheered, homes that had been Apple-free would have a chance to take a bite for $499.
3/10/2005	Building a Library With Shelves Full of Memories	THE Internet was supposed to herald the death of the printed page, but it turns out that rainy afternoons tucked into a good Web site lack romance. Instead, bookworms are turning to the Web to build their personal libraries. Michael DiRuggiero, co-owner of the Manhattan Rare Books Company on Second Avenue in Manhattan, has been a professional book collector for nine years. He suggests that beginners simply acquire books they like. ''A lot of people try to collect what they think they should be collecting,'' Mr. DiRuggiero said. ''At some point you end up with a collection you don't feel passionate about.''
3/7/2005	On EBay, E-Mail Phishers Find a Well-Stocked Pond	Donald Jay Alofs got a call last fall at home asking if he had recently bought several thousand dollars worth of electronics. Mr. Alofs had not, and he had a good reason for not being on a spending spree: he was in the hospital at the time. Things got worse for Mr. Alofs, a coin collector and dealer who buys and sells on eBay. His inbox was soon filled with e-mail messages from irate buyers: someone had used his eBay account to sell about $780,000 worth of coins -- about five times the online business Mr. Alofs had done over several years -- and many of the coins offered for sale never existed.
3/6/2005	EBay's Joy Ride: Going Once . . .	THE open revolt began almost instantly among eBay's sellers -- a hodgepodge of hobbyists, slick entrepreneurs and quirky collectors who conduct daily virtual auctions of everything from samurai swords and refrigerator magnets to an unread copy of an ''Archie and Veronica'' comic book (Volume 55). In January, eBay announced steep fee increases, which took effect two weeks ago, prompting sellers to post caustic comments on community bulletin boards both on and off the company's Web site. Petitions have been circulated, sellers have debated an eBay boycott and those unhappy with the company seem evenly split over whether ''FeeBay'' or ''GreedBay'' is the most apt epithet for it. Inside eBay, the reaction to all this is: So what else is new?
2/24/2005	Cocktail Sets the Rat Pack Would Love	THREE-MARTINI lunches, honey-I'm-home cocktails -- there's nothing so cozy as vintage vices. Except, of course, vintage barware. Five years ago Gerald Nixon opened Mr. Pink Inc., a vintage barware and housewares shop in Chelsea (mrpinkinc.com). He has been collecting glassware since childhood. ''My mother used to take us to McDonald's and all of those places that would give away cartoon glasses,'' Mr. Nixon said.
2/23/2005	Piece of Boxing's Glory Days Is Recovered Via the Internet	Every champion has many victories, but the hardest and dearest kind is often the comeback. In boxing history, the first heavyweight championship comeback was Floyd Patterson's toppling of the great Swedish fighter Ingemar Johansson to regain the heavyweight championship title in 1960.
2/16/2005	'Gates' Relic Gets EBay Bid, And Seller Gets Complaints	Sometimes a cardboard tube is just a cardboard tube. But sometimes, as a New York teenager discovered this week, a cardboard tube might be an objet d'art worth $1,200 -- to the right buyer. Last Saturday, Dane Kolomatsky, 15, accompanied his mother and a friend of hers to Central Park to view ''The Gates,'' the public artwork created by Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, and composed of 7,500 saffron-colored nylon curtains hanging from rectangular frames along the pathways of the park.
2/13/2005	The Battle for Taliesin	On Jan. 24, a Monday night, Jack Holzhueter learned that 32 photographs of Taliesin -- Frank Lloyd Wright's home and studio in Spring Green, Wis. -- were for sale on eBay. Mr. Holzhueter, on the board of curators of the Wisconsin Historical Society, looked at the Web site and realized that the photos were exceedingly rare. ''They're a Rosetta stone for the building,'' he said: they were taken in 1911 and 1912; Taliesin burned in 1914 and was rebuilt in somewhat different form. Mr. Holzhueter, a retired writer and, he says, ''full-time patsy,'' told his colleagues, ''We've got to do something about this.'' The auction would end at 9:17, Central time, on Friday night, Jan. 28. JAN. 25 Mr. Holzhueter, 69, began working the phone at his home in Mazomanie, northwest of Madison. He learned that the seller was an 82-year-old retired doctor in Alabama who did not seem to realize what she had on her hands; she had obtained the album from a friend who had been active in the arts in Wisconsin, and expected to get about $200 for it. Mr. Holzhueter knew better and pledged $2,000 to get the fund-raising ball rolling. JAN. 26 He began to receive pledges from Wright aficionados. ''By the end of the day, I had about $5,000,'' he said, ''and realized I needed to do better.''JAN. 27 Mr. Holzhueter talked to a friend in California who was an expert on Wright, and they determined that while the bidding was still under $5,000, they would need $22,000 to $23,000 to win. ''That was a real stretch,'' Mr. Holzhueter said. ''I had about $10,000 by the end of the day. I realized I would have to involve institutions.'' JAN. 28 At daybreak Mr. Holzhueter contacted Georgia Snoke in Tulsa, Okla. She sent an appeal to fellow members of the Lloyd-Jones family (Wright's mother's clan); it drew close to $5,000. Mr. Holzhueter also called the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy in Chicago and asked it to send out an e-mail appeal. ''By noon I was close to $17,000,'' he said, ''and we were talking to people at the Getty. But they didn't have enough time to mobilize their bureaucracy. So then Getty staff members began making pledges themselves. It was very touching. There was nothing in it for anyone -- they just wanted to be part of the effort.'' He worked the phones and e-mail all day, toggling between them because he has only one phone line. ''Once a friend managed to break through, and I said to him, 'I can't talk now; I'm trying to do this thing,''' he said. ''He doesn't have much money, so I never asked him, but he gave $500.'' By then Mr. Holzhueter had $28,200 in pledges ranging from $50 to $2,500. THE FINAL MOMENTS Over the last hour, as clusters of Wright fans watched on computers across the country, the price leaped from $10,000 to $20,000. The historical society had not yet bid. ''Andy Kraushaar, the photo archivist at the society and a very experienced eBay bidder, had access to what is known as sniping ware -- special bidding software and a high-speed connection to eBay,'' Mr. Holzhueter said. ''With 20 seconds to go, Andy put in his bid of $28,200, which trumped all the other bids. In the end, the eBay price turned out to be $22,100. So we prorated the pledges; everyone is going to save 26 percent.'' THE AFTERMATH The album was expected to arrive at the historical society in Madison this past week. The only problem was shipping: ''FedEx wanted something like $2000, with all the insurance on the photos. So a guy from the society is going to fly down to Alabama and get them.'' FRED A. BERNSTEIN
2/11/2005	Boston Site To Take It One Name At a Time	It's possible that the Boston Celtics will be playing this month in the ZeroBrokerFees.com Center. Celtics fans, Bostonians, companies and anyone else have the opportunity to own, for a day, the naming rights for the building currently known as the Fleet Center, where the Celtics play their home games. All they have to do is be the high bidder in an auction on eBay that began yesterday.

2/7/2005	EBay Alters Sellers' Fees and Adds Support	EBay, the online auction site, has altered a recent decision to increase fees. In a letter posted on its Web site yesterday, Bill Cobb, president of eBay North America, said that the company would reduce certain minimum listing fees by 5 cents, to 25 cents, on its United States and Canadian Web sites.
2/6/2005	Is Online Retailing a Victim of Its Own Success?	ONLINE retailers have benefited from some very conspicuous consumption, on their Web sites and especially on Wall Street. Shares of companies in the sector rose nearly 80 percent last year, among the best performances in the entire stock market. But investors seem to have developed a strong case of buyer's remorse. Many companies in the sector are trading lower since the start of this year, including two of the leaders, Amazon.com, down 19.3 percent, and eBay, off 40 percent. The stock of Shopping.com, a site that lets shoppers compare prices from different merchants, is down 33 percent.
2/3/2005	It's Maybe a Bubble, but a Selective One	Is the Internet bubble half empty or half full? With Google's stock on a roll, rising more than 7 percent yesterday to close at $205.96 and prompting some analysts to predict it will hit $290 or more in the coming months, it can seem like the late 1990's again on Wall Street. Shares in Google have been trading for less than six months, but they have risen 142 percent and the company has a market value of $56.2 billion, equal to that of Starbucks, Nike and Southwest Airlines -- combined.
1/30/2005	Law and Order: County Style	THE case groaned with accusations of police corruption and retaliation, frame-ups and false arrests, gold digging and salacious backseat fumblings. And, of course, a heavy dose of secretly taped conversations. No, it's not an episode of ''The Wire.'' It's the battle between Mamaroneck Village's Police Department and four of its officers.
1/20/2005	Tuna on Rye, Transported With Panache	I'M not claiming it's dignified to haunt a school's lost-and-found bin, lurking like a vampire who is waiting for an unprotected neck to walk by. I'm just saying I had no choice. Early this month my 7-year-old daughter lost her lunchbox. In January, the back-to-school lunchboxes that only a few months ago spilled from every drugstore aisle in town are long gone. What choice did I have but to skulk around the ''lost'' bin, hoping for a miracle?
1/20/2005	EBay Forecast Misses by a Bit, And Shares Fall	EBay, the online auction place, found how unforgiving bidders can be. Shares of eBay fell nearly 12 percent, as much as $12, in after-hours trading on Wednesday because its quarterly earnings missed Wall Street's expectations by a penny a share -- this despite profits that were up 44 percent.
1/20/2005	Warm Cookies Baked for Cold, Hard Cash	ITEM -- Cookies for Every Holiday BUY IT NOW PRICE -- $100 EBAY ITEM NUMBER -- 5547074909 WHEN Marlene Johnson's mortgage increased by $400 a month, she wasn't sure what to do. Her income from cleaning local houses and businesses was already stretched thin providing for herself and her 14-year-old daughter, Krystal, she said. So she decided to save their house with an old-fashioned bake sale -- on eBay. ''Everybody loves to eat,'' she said. ''I was sitting here thinking, what can I do that everybody likes? That's when I came up with the cookie idea.''
1/18/2005	Purloined Domain Name Is an Unsolved Mystery	It was yet another reminder of how vulnerable a company's brand name can be in the world of electronic commerce. In the space of about 48 hours over the weekend, Panix.com, New York City's oldest commercial Internet service provider, saw its name slip out of its control and become the center of an international cyberhunt to get it back. Whether maliciously or inadvertently, the company's main domain name -- panix.com -- had somehow been transferred to a company in Australia.
1/13/2005	Hibernation Season Has Its Rewards	WHEN the weather is cold and wet and the world goes dark well before suppertime, the last thing I need to see is a rack of bathing suits. Or skimpy sandals. Or white pants. This aversion generally stops me from shopping during the bleak post-Christmas months, when retailers begin to prematurely push spring merchandise on unwitting customers who ducked into their stores mainly to get warm.
1/9/2005	The Call of the Wild, Again, in Internet Funds	IT was a spectacular year for some of the largest Internet stocks. Google's share price doubled after its initial public offering and Yahoo and eBay staged yearlong rallies. Despite these gains, many investors remain wary of mutual funds that focus on the sector -- and for good reason, many analysts say.

1/4/2005	Technology Briefing | People: EBay Hires Chief Technology Officer	EBay has named Christopher F. Corrado as its chief technology officer, succeeding Marty Abbott, who is leaving the company after more than five years. Mr. Corrado joins eBay from AT&T Wireless, where he was executive vice president and chief information officer, eBay said yesterday. Mr. Abbott will work with Mr. Corrado for several months to help with the transition, said eBay, based in San Jose, Calif. The chief executive, Meg Whitman, has been focusing on technology since eBay's site experienced a 22-hour failure in June 1999.
1/2/2005	EBay's Little Helpers	A BRAND-NEW year and already so much to purge: bad habits, unrealistic resolutions and most likely unwanted holiday gifts. Left untouched, the gifts join the clutter that accumulates in closets each year, rising higher and higher, threatening to tumble forth like an alpine avalanche the instant the door is opened. It is time for decisiveness. It is time for eBay, that all-season national yard sale.
12/30/2004	Customer Service: The Hunt for a Human	TRY to reach customer service at Amazon.com to fix a problem with an order and you will encounter one of the most prominent and frustrating aspects of the Internet era: a world devoid of humans. Not only is there no telephone number on Amazon's Web site, but the company makes a point of not including one. Instead, customers are asked to fill out an online form and wait for a response. ''It's incredibly annoying,'' said Ellen Hobbs of Austin, Tex., whose frustration has led her to publish Amazon.com's customer support number at her own Web site (clicheideas.com/amazon.htm). ''They haven't invested the kind of money in helping you solve problems as they have in selling you things.'' In December alone, some 1,100 people visited Ms. Hobbs's site.
12/23/2004	Rationalizing? Yes, but What a Deal	IN the 1970's there was a general belief that Santa was susceptible to flowery language. My brothers and I spent weeks crafting Dickensian salutations -- ''Kind Sir, I write with hope that both you and Mrs. S. have enjoyed good health and happiness in these long months since last we communicated'' -- to divert attention from the fact that our requests were so greedy. One year my brother asked for a car, hoping Santa would overlook the fact that in Illinois 8-year-olds didn't have driver's licenses. Once, the four of us co-signed a plea for a trip to Disneyland. Another letter mentioned a ''real Thompson submachine gun.''
12/22/2004	Technology Briefing | People: Indian Court Releases Ebay Manager	An Indian court released the head of eBay's India unit on bail yesterday, four days after his arrest in connection with the listing for sale of a pornographic video clip through the Indian Web site Baazee.com. Avnish Bajaj, left, an American of Indian origin, was taken into custody by the New Delhi police to be held without bail until Friday. The Delhi High Court, however, ordered Mr. Bajaj's release, but directed him to surrender his passport and not leave the country without permission. A sexually graphic video clip involving two teenagers from a New Delhi school recorded through a camera phone was offered for sale by a user on Baazee. Several copies were sold before the sale was called off. Saritha Rai (NYT)
12/21/2004	EBay Fights India Arrest Over Sale Of Sex Video	The arrest of the Indian-born chief of Baazee.com, the unit of eBay that is India's largest Internet auction site, has raised an uproar, prompting calls for clearer laws on whether executives of such sites can be prosecuted because of the material, like pornography, that is offered for sale. Avnish Bajaj, chief of Baazee, was arrested Friday in a case related to the sale on the Baazee site of a video clip of a teenage couple from an exclusive New Delhi school engaged in a sex act.
12/13/2004	A Judge for Sale on EBay, Shipping Included, Isn't Laughing	When Jerald R. Klein, a Manhattan housing court judge, got a call from a reporter yesterday morning, he had no idea why he was being bothered at home on the weekend. He did not know that his face was all over eBay. He did not know that he was for sale.
12/12/2004	EBay Vigilantism	Since its inception, the Internet has been likened to the Wild West, but a culture further along in its development would provide a more apt reference point: New York City in the 70's -- a vast metropolis, infinitely diverse, with pockets of untamed sleaze suggesting an overall tolerance for corruption in the system. Places like this breed a certain kind of vigilante hero -- not the brazen, spur-clinking swashbucklers of a lawless frontier but the silent, seething types, the unexpected, subterranean enforcers. Enter the eBay vigilantes. This year you could find these people patrolling the electronics and rare-stamp and kitchenware offerings of the world's largest online auction house. Their goal is to stop dishonest auctioneers from selling products they don't actually have, and their deal-busting methods are wily: rescuing na?ve customers by outbidding them with outlandishly high offers (which they never pay); sending potentially fraudulent sellers seemingly innocent e-mail messages with surveillance systems attached; contacting would-be buyers to let them in on what they say are the telltale signs of a scam -- the hidden bidder list, the request to pay by Western Union, the false location. (Andorra, a principality in the Pyrenees, is frequently listed by swindlers who are based in Romania.)

12/7/2004	EBay at a Crossroads: Can 'Buy Now' Share Space With 'Bid Now'?	MEET Michael Brayton, the latest variation on the eBay seller. Mr. Brayton, who sells lighting fixtures and chandeliers from his shop in Ocala, Fla., loves eBay's ability to bring in customers. But he finds the auctions a hassle. Instead of dealing with those, he sells his items on eBay Stores (stores.ebay.com), where he can list inventory for longer than seven days and sell it at a fixed price. ''Less than 10 percent of our items are at auction,'' Mr. Brayton said. ''To tell you, honestly, the auctions are strictly advertising.''
11/29/2004	Back in Black	The shoving, trampling and tugs of war synonymous with the Friday after Thanksgiving may have kept some Americans home this year, but that does not mean they were not shopping. On the unofficial start of holiday shopping, 13.3 million people visited online stores, an 11 percent increase from 2003, and a record, according to a report scheduled to be released today by Nielsen/NetRatings. The spike represented a 26 percent increase over shopping traffic on the previous Friday.
11/29/2004	To Stretch City's Budget for the Arts, Chicago Turns to EBay	The view out of Lois Weisberg's office window is of the dazzling art installations at the new Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the world's great museums. For Ms. Weisberg, commissioner of cultural affairs in Chicago, the view is a constant reminder of how important the arts are to this city. And for the last 20 years, Ms. Weisberg has dreamed up scores of ideas to cultivate and promote the arts in Chicago. Now, with the city facing a $220 million budget deficit and civic arts financing slowly drying up, Ms. Weisberg is trying out another new idea: an online auction on eBay.
11/25/2004	EBay Sellers Do the Holiday Sprint	YOU think the holidays are hectic? Talk to an eBay Power Seller about the next few weeks, and the realization will dawn: You don't know hectic. These people are turning their living rooms into inventory centers, diving into Dumpsters for spare boxes, stuffing cars and closets with packing peanuts, checking for e-mail every free minute and racing to the post office nearly every afternoon. That's on top of the shopping, decorating, party planning and holiday stress that afflicts everyone else.
11/22/2004	Internet Retailers Reaching Out to Mailbox Surfers	EBay has long been among the Web's most popular destinations. So why is it now making house calls? Last week, millions of people in the United States opened their mailboxes to find a catalog from eBay, a 32-page glossy publication that, fortunately for postal carriers, included just a handful of the 29 million items currently for sale on the site.
11/21/2004	No Gifts, No Guilt: A Survival Guide for Scrooges	THE season of joy is upon us, which basically means that it's dark most of the time and that Christmas is coming. Again. Now don't get the wrong idea. Joy is a fine thing. Let's hear it for joy. It's when joy becomes mandatory that the trouble starts. And some people, heretical as it may seem, would just as soon sit out all this joy, or at least the gift-giving part -- if others would only let them.
11/15/2004	As Technology Stocks Climb, It Starts to Feel Like the 90's All Over Again	For the Internet analyst, happy days are here again. As the stock prices of companies like Google and eBay soared this year, two of the biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street, who four years ago were derided as false prophets too eager to put the commercial interests of their firms ahead of investors, are basking in a renewed glow. Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley -- who was celebrated and then disparaged as the ''queen of the Net'' -- is once more out on the stump, extolling the commercial opportunities of the Internet, churning out comprehensive reports and using her still considerable sway to help land Wall Street's biggest investment banking deals -- like Google's public offering -- for her firm.
11/11/2004	Sprucing Up the Storefront When the Address Is EBay	Dedicated eBay sellers looking to jazz up their online storefronts may be interested in a customized version of Macromedia's user-friendly Contribute 3 program that has been created just for users of the popular auction site. Contribute, which has been helping nontechnical users design and maintain professional-looking Web pages for the last few years, uses templates and other visual tools and does not require typing long lines of code to make a page. The eBay edition of Contribute 3, which works with Windows, will come with 800 templates that can be customized with product images, descriptions, logos and other standard Web page elements. Step-by-step software wizards guide the way. Finished pages can be published on eBay with one click. Sellers are not restricted to using templates; personally designed pages are easy to add. Contribute can also update existing pages with new merchandise.
10/30/2004	Museum Asks EBay To Block Some Sales	For centuries, London has served as an international market for the treasures and antiquities of empires. Thus the looting of Iraq's National Museum and numerous archaeological sites of Mesopotamia has incited British parliamentarians to crack down on the illicit antiquities trade -- this time of its own national treasures. The pieces are recovered by a record number of Britons (about 10,000 each weekend) who scour field, forest and shire with metal detectors in hopes of finding some mud-encrusted relics.
10/24/2004	Flying at 14	My daughter, a month shy of her 15th birthday, is traveling on Delta Airlines with some of her lacrosse teammates, all over 15. Delta says children ''between the ages of 5 and 14'' require an escort, for which they would charge $150. Since my daughter is 11 months beyond her 14th birthday, I do not feel she needs the escort, but Delta will not board her without one if she has not turned 15. May I tell my daughter to say she's 15? If Delta won't acknowledge the existence of numbers between 14 and 15, she can state a number they understand and that more accurately represents her age. Lisa Wiseman, Austin, Tex. You may not urge your daughter to say she is 15 if she is not 15. Delta's inflexible rule is foolish and overreaching; it ignores the wishes of parents and the various levels of maturity of young passengers. But coaching your daughter to lie is also unpalatable.
10/24/2004	EBay Merchants Trust Their Eyes, and the Bubble Wrap	ONLINE auction Web sites like eBay conjure images of vast electronic tag sales where people can unload unwanted personal items -- clothes that don't fit, or that ugly lamp Aunt Alice gave them last Christmas. But while much of what's sold on eBay has indeed been purged from someone's attic or garage, that is only part of the story. An estimated half-million people make a full- or part-time living by auctioning everything from macram to Maseratis on the Internet. In the online auction world, they are called power sellers, and they have succeeded by researching consumer trends, finding reliable sources for goods and not sparing the bubble wrap.
10/21/2004	When the Price Is a Penny, What Profit?	FANS of John Wayne, take notice: On eBay last week, a search of the actor's name in the movie category returned more than 2,000 items. Many had opening bids of less than $1 and included offers to ''Buy It Now'' for just a few dollars. But one, a VHS tape of ''Flying Tigers,'' had a particularly intriguing ''Buy It Now'' price: $.01. That's one penny. One cent. One forgotten coin in the family of small change that lives under the floor mats in your car.
10/4/2004	A growing Internet service has attracted a loyal following but, strangely, no rivals.	WHY is Meetup.com so alone? In nearly every Internet category imaginable, successful sites have triggered copycats, sometimes by the dozens. But Meetup, which has helped more than 30,000 groups -- including knitters, Republicans and pug owners -- organize online and meet offline in the last two years, and has earned a following among technology's elite, remains virtually without competition.
10/1/2004	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: EBay To Double Some Fraud Coverage	EBay will double fraud coverage for American buyers who use PayPal as it seeks to promote the electronic payment service and gain new customers. Insurance coverage under PayPal's buyer protection plan will increase to $1,000 on Nov. 8, an eBay spokesman, Hani Durzy, said. The plan will cover about 80 percent of items listed on the United States site of eBay.com, the company said. EBay, based in San Jose, Calif., is raising safeguards after the $500 of protection it began offering in June 2003 increased the adoption of PayPal and use of the company's online auctions, Mr. Durzy said.
9/19/2004	Some Action Figures Are Meant to Be Seen, Not Smashed	TEN years ago, Todd McFarlane wanted to produce an action figure of the character Spawn from his best-selling comic book series. He met with toy companies but felt that none understood how to make or market a plastic likeness of the character that would properly honor its macabre spirit. So he created his own company, McFarlane Toys, in Tempe, Ariz., and tried something radically different: he decided not to design the toys for 6-year-old boys, who tend to grab action figures in each hand and smash them together in a crude facsimile of combat. Instead, his figures, produced in intricate detail and in stylized poses, are ''not to be played with,'' he said.
9/9/2004	Out for V-I-C-T-O-R-Y, but Missing Tiles	I AM tempted to say I grew up in a family that enjoyed board games and leave it at that. But a statement like that might conjure up a misleading impression of a wholesome, 1960's family gathered around the kitchen table.
9/6/2004	MediaTalk; When This Book Argued for Shift In Antitrust Policy, Its Subject Smiled	''The Keystone Advantage,'' a business book published two weeks ago, is creating an admiring stir within the not-inconsiderable cottage industry of academics and consultants who study innovation, competition and corporate strategy. It also comes with a recommendation from one of its chief subjects: Bill Gates of Microsoft. The book -- by Marco Iansiti, a professor at the Harvard Business School, and Roy Levien, a technology consultant -- looks at markets and competition through the prism of biology, especially the ''keystones'' (species or companies) that serve as the hubs of biological or economic ecosystems. But the most provocative part of the book is the argument that antitrust policy needs to be rethought. Keystone companies, they say, are powerful yet benevolent. They never dominate industries, the authors insist, but enable larger economic ecosystems to thrive.
9/6/2004	Craig's To-Do List: Leave Millions on the Table	When they write the history of the greatest Silicon Valley entrepreneur that never was, they should remember to mention his pedometer. If anything symbolizes the efforts of Craig Newmark, founder and keeper of Craigslist (www.craigslist.org), a Web site used each month by millions of people to exchange goods, services and points of view, it is the gadget that measures how many steps he takes each day. It was given to Mr. Newmark by his nutritionist.
9/5/2004	The Mouse in the Antiques Shop	NOT so long ago, throngs of people used to antique for entire weekend afternoons. Customers would stroll from shop to shop in towns like Tarrytown and Larchmont, to look, touch, hang out, savoring the ritual of the hunt at least as much as the eureka moment of actually finding the item they were hunting for. ''The good old days of the 80's and 90's were wonderful,'' said Peter Fallon, who with his wife, Jenny, runs Fallon's Antiques in Mount Pleasant. The business also exhibits antiques and promotes antiques shows.
9/2/2004	On the Trail of Discontinued Fabrics	A READER who loves her sofa and her bedroom draperies so much that she has been loyal to them for more than two decades recently wrote to me for help. The problem was that the fabrics had faded and, in the case of the couch, had suffered cat-related damage. She was ready to reupholster and to replace the curtains with identical fabric, but was unable to find the material.
8/30/2004	E-Commerce Report; For a cut of the proceeds, some stores will help you sell on eBay. And now, eBay will even help you find them.	EBAY dropoff stores, which list, package and ship eBay items for people who cannot be bothered to do it themselves, have gotten a little help in their quest to find a market -- from eBay itself. Anyone looking for the stores would have, until recently, found almost nothing on eBay, even though at least 1,000 such stores exist solely to list more goods on eBay. But dropoff store operators say that some changes this month suggest that eBay could be steering them to more profitable waters. The company has begun promoting the stores on its site, listing them in a public database and creating standards of conduct to help keep sellers from handing their goods over to the wrong people.
8/29/2004	Buying a Dock Is Easy As Going Online	If you have been searching for a slightly used aluminum, interlocking floating lake dock, Westchester County has 39 of them -- 3 feet wide by 20 feet long -- for sale on eBay. State law requires governments to auction off surplus products, and it spells out how they accomplish that, Andrew J. Spano, the county executive, said recently, explaining the decision to use the online site. ''Times change,'' he said. ''We in the county government constantly re-evaluate how we do things.''
8/27/2004	U.S. Tally in Online-Crime Sweep: 150 Charged	The Justice Department announced Thursday that more than 150 people had been arrested, charged or convicted in the last three months in a wide-ranging sweep of criminal activity on the Internet. The cases, involving credit card fraud, corporate espionage and other offenses, are part of what the department called Operation Web Snare. The sweep was conducted by 37 offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 13 divisions of the Postal Inspection Service and other federal and local agencies. Investigators have identified more than 150,000 victims with losses in excess of $215 million.
8/17/2004	What Happens When You Buy a Post Office on eBay	It was just a little country post office in the panhandle in the back of a 1907 general store where shelves still held World War II meat-ration coupons. The mail for 52 people was sorted into 18 old paymaster's boxes from the Union Pacific Railroad, and the combination to the antique post office safe was scrawled on the wall.
8/16/2004	Renaissance Festival Goes on Ye Olde Internet Auction Block	Hear ye all good gentles: the Sterling Renaissance Festival, full of toothsome wenches and hearty drinks, has fetched a princely sum at auction. The seller might accept gold coins, but certainly not PayPal. The festival, which celebrates 16th-century England, the time of William Shakespeare, went up for sale this month in the most modern of ways: Internet auction. ''EBay told us it had never been done before,'' said Thomas Collier, a real estate agent who had tried for several years to sell the festival site -- half a dozen buildings on 35 acres -- and the surrounding land, through conventional means. ''We thought, 'Let's shock the world.'''
8/14/2004	EBay Buys 25% Stake in Craigslist, an Online Bulletin Board	Two Silicon Valley institutions have joined forces: EBay, the Internet marketplace, announced Friday that it had acquired a 25 percent stake in craigslist, an online community site used by millions of people to hunt for jobs, dates and places to live. EBay did not purchase the stake directly from craigslist, which is privately owned, but from an existing shareholder in the community site (www.craigslist.org).
7/22/2004	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Ebay Profit Up 107%	Profit at eBay surged in the second quarter, although investors were disappointed that its growth was not even faster. The company reported yesterday that it earned $190 million, up 107 percent. Excluding some one-time items, earnings were 29 cents a share, 2 cents more than analysts expected. EBay's revenue was $773 million in the quarter, up 52 percent from a year ago. EBay continued to benefit from its rapidly growing international operations. Revenue outside the United States grew 76 percent, to $274 million. Domestic revenue grew 32 percent, to $319 million. EBay said revenue for the year could be as high as $3.185 billion, $35 million more than its previous forecast. It expects its earnings per share to be $1.10 for the year, 4 cents more than before. But eBay's own estimate fell short of the $1.19 a share that analysts had been predicting for its full-year profit. As a result, the company's shares fell $4.20 in trading after the market close, to $72.40. Saul Hansell (NYT)
7/12/2004	E-Commerce Report; As online sales soar for used books, the publishing industry's fears may sound hauntingly familiar to the music industry.	IS Amazon.com becoming the Napster of the book business? The analogy may not be far off, say some observers of the used-book industry. Publishers, particularly textbook publishers, have long countered used-book sales by churning out new editions every couple of years. But the Web, particularly sites like Amazon and eBay, have given millions of consumers an easy way to find cheap books -- often for under $1 -- without paying royalty fees to publishers or authors.
6/17/2004	New Tech Surge in Ireland, And It Feels Like '99 Again	Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, standing alongside the chief executive of Intel, Craig R. Barrett, cut the ribbon on Monday to open the company's newest semiconductor plant, at Leixlip, outside Dublin. A month earlier, Intel said it would spend $2 billion to build another mammoth factory at the sprawling site. A week before that, eBay's chief executive, Margaret C. Whitman, flew to Ireland to officiate at the opening of her company's newest European location, which will eventually employ 800 people.
6/3/2004	They Got It All on eBay (or Did They?)	IN theory, 90 percent of the contents of each room came from eBay, and the budgets were to include paint, window treatments, special labor and supplies. But nearly every designer broke the rules. Most dodging was done through a loophole: the show house's beneficiary, the Alpha Workshops, contributed $9,000 in hand-blocked wallpaper for Matthew Patrick Smyth as well as $2,000 in wallpapering on his screen, seen at left; $1,500 in faux wood-graining on a table for Sheila Bridges; a $6,700 floor cloth for Thomas Jayne; and $2,000 of custom painting for Isabelle Bosquet's outdoor room. There were other shortcuts. Mr. Smyth hired his own contractor to build out a fireplace mantel. Lulu de Kwiatkowski used wallpaper from her own line -- and it's not cheap. David Netto used much of his own furniture for the nursery and spent less than 40 percent of his $10,000 eBay budget.
6/3/2004	Picky Fingers Root In America's Attic	LAST year, when eBay, the on-line market that is taking over the universe, came to Manhattan to put on a show house, it seemed thoroughly lacking in vision. Why would the 21st century's greatest retailing success story -- ''The Perfect Store,'' as a 2002 book called it -- stoop to pick up a dcor chestnut stale enough to date from Victorian England? EBay's goals, to give the show-house world a shot of ragtag can-do and promote itself in the process, enjoyed a mixed success. The house was not open to the public, viewing it on-line was dizzying and by the time the contents were auctioned off months later, everyone had forgotten about it. Moreover, last year it was painfully clear which of the six designers could smoothly navigate the mammoth river basin that is eBay, and which neophytes floundered in alluvial sludge.
6/1/2004	How to Tip a Guide Who Has a Slow Camel and a Fast Horse	Years ago, when I worked at PepsiCo, a British colleague and I were traveling from Dubai to Cairo. When he learned we were going to be flying Egypt Air, he said that he didn't have a fear of flying except on that airline. He'd had some bad experiences with them. It didn't reassure him to see the Egypt Air mechanic pumping oil into the plane with a foot pump as we walked to the plane. Earlier that day, the weather reports had indicated that the Cairo airport was closed because of heavy sandstorms, but the ticket agent at the counter in Dubai assured us the weather in Cairo was fine. About halfway through the flight, the pilot came on the intercom and said that because of fierce sandstorms, the Cairo airport was advising all flights to land elsewhere. He said we were going to land at a remote airstrip at the south end of the Red Sea and take a 14-hour bus ride the rest of the way.
5/9/2004	What an Old Sears Catalog Could Teach eBay Today	IN warning about the consequences of invading Iraq, Colin L. Powell offered what he called the Pottery Barn rule: You break it, you own it. If, in a civilian context, someone coined an eBay rule, it might be this: ''Satisfaction most emphatically not guaranteed. All sales final.'' When Internet bulletin boards were first melded with auctions, there was little reason for buyers to pause in the absence of a guarantee. Bids were tiny, the risk small and the entertainment value of the novelty considerable. In the beginning, eBay's rise was anything but predictable; as late as 1997, it was but one funky site among 150 or so online auctions.
4/22/2004	Earnings Rose 92% For EBay in Quarter	EBay Inc., the world's largest Internet auction company, said first-quarter earnings surged 92 percent, the most in a year, as more people listed items for sale on its sites. Net income climbed to $200.1 million, or 30 cents a share, from $104.2 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales rose 59 percent, to $756.2 million, from $476.5 million. EBay beat analysts' earnings estimates by 5 cents a share.
4/17/2004	Buffett Sells Passes to Beat Scalpers	The yearly gathering to hear the ''oracle of Omaha,'' Warren E. Buffett, speak at the annual meeting of the Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, has become so popular that Mr. Buffett has begun selling tickets to nonshareholders. Mr. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, decided to sell tickets to the meeting at the price of $5 for a pair after he learned that shareholders were auctioning tickets on eBay's Web site, said Marc Hamburg, Berkshire's chief financial officer.
3/28/2004	Ideas & Trends: Frontier Justice; On the Web, Vengeance Is Mine (and Mine)	YOU can almost hear the spurs jingling. Self-appointed sheriffs scan eBay and Yahoo auctions looking for fraud. When they find it -- or at least when they think they've found it -- they warn buyers or make outrageously high bids themselves in order to end the auction and prevent potential victims from falling into the trap. Elsewhere, private crusaders cruise Internet chat rooms for pedophiles and report their findings to law enforcement -- or even expose them online. And hackers release programs into cyberspace that repair the damage done by malicious computer viruses.
3/20/2004	With Internet Fraud Up Sharply, EBay Attracts Vigilantes	Five months ago, Klaus Priebe, a soft-spoken building contractor who said he was sick and tired of fraud on eBay, decided it was time to catch the cheaters at their game. In one recent auction, he bid as much as $2.5 million on a telescope worth no more than $2,000. He knew he would not have to pay for the telescope because he was sure that it did not exist.
3/20/2004	How to Avoid Auction Scams	Here are some tips for avoiding scams on eBay and other online auction sites. PRICE -- Be wary if the price of an expensive item, especially one advertised as brand new, is priced far below the standard retail price. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
3/20/2004	The Cookie Loophole	To the Editor: ''Crave Thin Mints? Girl Scout Cookies Available on eBay'' (front page, March 13) brings another fine example of adults' treading on the innocence of their children. The Girl Scouts teach values like fair play, honesty and working to make the world better. Adults do a disservice by trying to find a ''loophole'' that lets them sell cookies online.
3/14/2004	Personal Business; Covet That Car? For a Price, You Can Cut in Line	IF you must be the first on your block to drive one of this year's hottest cars, Internet-based auctions are making it easier to jump to the head of the line. But car experts list caveats for people who use these auctions, whether they are buying or selling a position on a dealer's waiting list. First, expect to pay a lot of money -- often tens of thousands of dollars -- to be first in line for cars like the redesigned 2005 Chevrolet Corvette or the Ford GT, both due later this year. And you may have to investigate what you are bidding against: a few dealers have been known to masquerade as consumers on online auctions, to ratchet up the price. There are two types of these auctions, whether on eBay or on sites for car enthusiasts. One is offered by a dealer, selling places on a waiting list for high-demand cars it has been allotted. Sometimes that may mean just one car; other times, there may be dozens of auctions for dozens of cars. The other type of auction is run by individuals who want to sell their places on waiting lists -- places they may have reserved months or even years in advance, sometimes by making deposits with dealers. In some cases, people on the lists may decide that they do not want the cars after all. Others, however, may have gotten on the list solely to make a profit.
3/14/2004	Crave Thin Mints? Girl Scout Cookies Available on eBay	The cookies are coming -- or are they? After a long winter of taking orders for cookies across the country, girls in the 2.9-million-member Girl Scouts organization have been delivering them this month. A similar frenzy of activity last year made the Scouts' leading seller, Thin Mints, the third-best-selling cookie in the United States, behind Oreos and Chips Ahoy.
3/2/2004	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Microsoft And eBay Plan Venture	Microsoft announced a partnership with eBay yesterday that will allow Office applications to tie into the online auction service. The software giant plans to offer free sample code through the eBay Developers Program and later Microsoft's MSDN developer site for tying selected Office applications to the auctioneer's listing servers. The eBay Developers Program allows developers to create programs that help large-scale sellers on the site manage inventory, automate listings and do other tasks.
3/1/2004	EBay Seller Of Fake Artwork Again Upsets The Auction Site	Kenneth Walton, who pleaded guilty in 2001 to federal wire and mail fraud charges for trying to sell a fake Richard Diebenkorn painting on eBay for $135,000 in a shill-bidding scam, has run afoul of eBay again. This time, though, it was not the authorities that did him in. It was his mom, albeit unintentionally.
2/22/2004	Gracious Living, if You're a Mad Scientist	INDUSTRIAL masks and helmets, electrostatic devices, antique toys and radios and countless peculiar scientific and cockamamie contraptions all make Steve Erenberg's accumulation more than a collection. Mr. Erenberg, a Cortlandt Manor resident, owns so many complicated and unusual objects that it brings to mind a Dr. Frankenstein's latter-day laboratory or an upscale version of Diagon Alley, the shopping street for wizards in the Harry Potter books, only this time with help from eBay.
2/19/2004	Hey, Jenny, Your Number Was on Wall, And on eBay	Jenny has always been two kinds of vamp. Promiscuous yet pure melody. A temptress but also a tune. And even though it has been more than two decades since her glory first began to fade, men still howl her name in the night. They still try to call her, too, only to find themselves futilely dialing a myth.
2/19/2004	Toyota becomes the first exclusive auto sponsor on EBay.	IN its latest effort to tap the advertising potential of the Internet, the Toyota Motor Corporation has agreed to become the first exclusive automotive sponsor on eBay, the online auction site, in a deal that promotes Toyota cars and trucks on special eBay pages and in online charity auctions. The agreement, which lasts through December, demonstrates how far Web sites will go to find new ad revenue, often by offering package deals they say are better and more engaging than scatterings of pop-up and banner ads. The deal also reflects Toyota's desire to stand out in a market that is bumper to bumper with competitors.
2/3/2004	Fashion Team Prepares to Put Its Best Digital Foot Forward	From the runway to eBay. Not the typical path for fashions from a hot young design team. But within days of its runway show during Fashion Week in New York next week, Proenza Schouler plans to auction some of the newly modeled clothes and shoes on eBay. The lot will include more than four dozen pairs of shoes, designed in league with Manolo Blahnik, and 50 garments, like a black silk charmeuse bustier dress with black patent leather sequins, and a pair of khaki and Nantucket-red suede shorts.

1/28/2004	In Online Auctions, Misspelling in Ads Often Spells Cash	When Holly Marshall wanted to sell a pair of dangling earrings, a popular style these days, she listed them on eBay once, and got no takers. She tried a second time, and still no interest. Was it the price? The fuzzy picture? Maybe the description: a beautiful pair of chandaleer earrings.
1/27/2004	Technology Briefing | Internet: EBay To Acquire Mobile.de For $152 Million	EBay, the world's largest Internet auctioneer, agreed yesterday to buy Mobile.de of Germany, which runs Web sites for selling used cars, for about $152 million. The acquisition gives eBay, based in San Jose, Calif., the biggest online vehicle classified business in Germany and strengthens its existing operations there, said Katja Riefler, a Munich-based analyst for Classified Intelligence, which tracks the Internet classified advertising market.
1/22/2004	EBay's 4th-Quarter Results Surpass Even Its Own Hopes	If there was one company that had a very merry Christmas, it was eBay. The company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter sales and profit were better than expected, largely because of the success of its efforts to position its site, a vast online market known originally for used knickknacks, as a source of holiday gifts. The company posted a profit of $142.5 million, or 21 cents a share, in the quarter, up 64 percent from $87 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The company had been expecting 19 cents a share, and analysts had forecast 20 cents.
1/18/2004	Fans of Clark's Argyle Can Bid Online	The sweater is going on eBay. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who recently donned an argyle sweater to help soften his stiff military image, and to stay warm in New Hampshire, announced on Friday night that he would put the sweater up for auction on the Internet, with the proceeds going to charity.
1/11/2004	A Piece of the Shore At Your Fingertips	That carousel on eBay may look familiar. It seems the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which runs the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, is looking for a home for its old carousel -- the one you would put the children on while waiting in the scorching August sun for your ship to come in.
1/6/2004	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay Changing Listing Fees	The world's largest Internet auctioneer, eBay, said yesterday that it would raise the listing fees it charges sellers using its sites in the United States and change the fee structures in 10 other countries to finance improvements. The United States fee increases will take effect in February and are included in the company's 2004 sales forecast, said Hani Durzy, a spokesman for eBay. They will run as high as 45 percent for the highest-priced auction items. Most fees will rise 9.1 percent. EBay, which is based in San Jose, Calif., is also adding new tiers to the pricing structure. The fees appear to be intended to persuade sellers to list with lower starting bids, said Steve Weinstein, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities.
1/4/2004	Online Auctions: Reducing Risks	LAST year when Paige Pierson lost her job in the San Francisco Bay Area's dot-com contraction, she resolved not to abandon her travel passions. The auctions on eBay had been a constant source of entertainment and the occasional bargain in recent years, and being a dot-commer, Ms. Pierson knew of other Web sites that sold travel through auctions. So in February, while musing about how to introduce her newborn son, Logan, to her extended family in Munich, she ventured online, looking to match the click of her mouse with the clack of a virtual auctioneer's gavel.
12/28/2003	Tragic Trading	I have an unused ticket for the World Trade Center observation deck. If I sell it on eBay, I'll likely get many times what I paid for it (and I have a lot of student loans), but to profit in this way just doesn't feel right. Would making money from such a sale be ethical? R.P., Chapel Hill, N.C. I understand your reluctance, but see no ethical objection to your selling an artifact of the World Trade Center, although I have no doubt some will be offended by your profiting from a tragedy. But that charge could also be leveled against those like doctors, newscasters and ethics columnists whose livelihoods often depend on the anguish and wrongdoing of others.
12/21/2003	Personal Business; Now You Can Leave the EBay Selling to Them	WHEN Marc Strohlein bought a mountain bicycle a few years ago, he put his old racing bike in the garage and forgot about it. It languished there until recently, when he noticed a highway billboard in the heart of Silicon Valley offering a tempting proposition: ''You drop it off. We sell it on eBay.'' So, on the day before Thanksgiving, Mr. Strohlein, 49, a market research analyst from El Granada, Calif., packed the racing bike into his sport utility vehicle and hauled it to AuctionDrop Inc. in San Carlos, Calif. The company is one of a handful of new businesses that will take in a customer's merchandise, photograph it, post it on eBay, the Internet auction site, then ship it to the winning bidder. (Customers drop off the merchandise themselves.)
12/14/2003	Trying to Buy Back McGreevey's Good Name	Stephen Reiter follows New Jersey politics closely, and periodically he browses www.politicsnj.com -- the Web site for political junkies from High Point to Cape May. Last month he was shocked by something he read there. ''A Web site, www.jimmcgreevey.com, was being offered for sale on eBay,'' said Mr. Reiter, who runs a yard-waste disposal and topsoil-manufacturing company in Union. ''I thought that someone would use it for negative purposes, and I didn't want the governor to be subjected to something like that.''
12/3/2003	The Search for the Perfect Gift: Just a Click, Not a Drive, Away	When someone types ''Christmas light sets'' into the Web search engine Google, the second listing, after a government recall notice, is the site for Aubuchon Hardware, a family-run chain of New England hardware stores. As a result, Aubuchon is now selling more light sets in California than in Massachusetts, its home state. The best-selling item last week on Amazon.com's new specialty meat department was the ''levages magret duck breast'' from Fossil Farms, a wild game farm in Lakeville, Pa. The duck beat out the top sirloin offered on the site by Omaha Steaks, the giant mail-order butcher.
11/17/2003	The Months of Work Behind Eileen's Lunch With Melissa	ANYONE who has planned a charity auction knows that it requires a head-spinning amount of organization. So when staff members for Communities in Schools, a national nonprofit group based in Alexandria, Va., gathered a few months ago to prepare for their second auction, the focus was on the pesky details of generating publicity and rallying for last-minute donations. But there was one big difference. This event was not going to be a black-tie affair on a Saturday night. Instead, the auction was to be held online at eBay. No catering. No parking headaches. No cleanup crew. Just a virtual event on computers around the world for five weeks. As the nonprofit group's staff members sat in the boardroom watching a demonstration of how the event would play out online, the radical newness of the project started to hit them.
11/17/2003	E-Commerce Report; Nervous about bidding on eBay? Hartford Insurance and a start-up are offering a policy to allay buyers' fears.	IN every fear lurks an insurance opportunity, even online. A small start-up company and the giant Hartford Financial Services Group plan to roll out a buyer protection plan today that is meant to instill confidence in shoppers on eBay -- the Web auction site that does a booming business but engenders such a fear of fraud that an estimated 8 of every 10 online shoppers steer clear of it. The proposed remedy, by Hartford and BuySafe, a start-up based in Alexandria, Va., is a type of insurance plan, to be paid for by participating sellers. Under it, an eBay shopper would be guaranteed up to $10,000 in coverage if a participating auction seller did not deliver advertised goods at the agreed-upon price.
10/22/2003	Online, Used Car Lots That Cover the Nation	STEFAN ROSEN of Huntington, N.Y., had given the chassis and transmission of his 1993 Dodge Dakota a thorough going-over long before he saw it. He spotted his $4,000 pickup among more than two million car listings on AutoTrader.com and flew to Detroit, where a representative of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich., picked him up at the airport. Mr. Rosen test-drove the truck he had studied in high-resolution photographs online, bought it and drove it all the way home. In seeking buyers like Mr. Rosen, automakers and dealers invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Internet commerce ventures in the late 90's. Start-up companies promised that buying cars on the Internet would send auto dealers down the path of encyclopedia salesmen. And major newspapers, fearing competition for their lucrative classified car advertisements, even formed their own Web-based business, cars.com.
10/21/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Bank One And EBay Settle Patent Suits	EBay Inc., the world's largest Web auctioneer, and the Bank One Corporation settled lawsuits asserting each other had infringed on patents for conducting financial transactions over the Internet. Bank One sued eBay on Sept. 6, contending patent infringement. EBay's PayPal unit sued Bank One on Sept. 29, claiming its online bill-payment system was being wrongly used. The suits were filed in federal court in Wilmington, Del.
10/17/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: EBay Shares Plunge In After-Hours Trading	Shares of eBay fell sharply in after-hours trading yesterday, as investors were not impressed enough by the company's financial projections for next year. EBay expects sales to grow 38 percent, to $2.9 billion. The company also expects its per-share profit to increase 50 percent, to 98 cents. But while the revenue projection matched analysts' expectations, the per-share profit estimate fell short of the $1.05 that Wall Street was looking for. In after-hours trading, eBay's shares were down $3.84 at $53.66. The company released its earnings after the close of regular trading. EBay said yesterday that its profit for the third quarter was $103 million, up 69 percent. Its sales were $531 million, up 84 percent. Excluding PayPal, the payment company that eBay acquired last October, the company's sales increased 46 percent. The company said its growth had slowed in the United States and Germany during the summer, but it expected to gain in the fourth quarter. Saul Hansell (NYT)
10/15/2003	Seductive Electronic Gadgets Are Soon Forgotten	Adam Lipson cannot decide which of the many gadgets he bought in the last couple of years proved most useless. Perhaps it was the microscope that hooked up to his computer. Then again, maybe Mr. Lipson, 42, would choose the universal remote control that came with a manual as thick as a Russian novel. But that would be shortchanging the Webcam -- a video camera that transfers images over the Internet -- that he used once, stashed in a closet and finally threw away.

9/21/2003	How Much Is That Evita In the Window?	IF you've ever dreamed of walking in Patti LuPone's shoes, you'd better hurry. The actress has already unloaded the ones she wore while rehearsing ''Evita''; tan, size 6, a little worse for wear, they sold on eBay for $76. Same with the strappy gold heels from ''Anything Goes.'' Her second set of juvenile toe shoes (''When you wear them,'' she wrote on the Web site, ''think of me'') were a bargain at $71, but a pair of black taps, circa 1987, went for a whopping $151.
9/17/2003	That Club on eBay. The Farmer Knew It Well.	The Case of the Missing Knife-Blade War Club was cold, see. Colder than the dark end of the Kansas museum storeroom where someone snatched it nine long years ago. ''I'd chased all my leads,'' said Ray Classen, 52, of the Police Department in North Newton, Kan., who is not only the chief but also half the full-time force. There were 34 items discovered missing from the Kauffman Museum's storeroom in May 1994, and the war club was the prize of them all.
9/8/2003	E-Commerce Report; Growing concern about fraud is pushing the online world into action. The task looms large, though.	CONSUMERS are losing trust in the Internet, and online companies are taking note. The Information Technology Association of America, a trade group, said last week that it would help create the Coalition on Online Identity Theft, composed of Internet retailers and security companies allied against what has become a significant problem both online and off. Word of the group's formation came eight weeks after the announcement of another industry association, the Merchant Risk Council, which was formed to combat online credit card fraud.
8/25/2003	MediaTalk; Auctioning Off the Past to Make a Future in Music	Some musicians build on the past for new albums, others bury it. David J hawked his past, piece by piece on eBay, to finance his new CD, ''Estranged.'' In the late 1970's, David J, the singer and bassist born David Haskins, was a founder of the influential British goth-rock group Bauhaus. Though his next band, Love and Rockets, had a Top 5 American hit with ''So Alive'' in 1989, he said today's consolidated music industry is not interested in taking risks on performers like him.
8/22/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Power Failure Affects Ebay Service	A power failure in eBay's Web hosting center crippled the Web auction service for nearly three hours, the company confirmed. The failure on Wednesday night struck a Qwest Communications center in Santa Clara, Calif., that serves as a host for many of eBay's Web servers, said an eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove. While the Qwest problem lasted only 10 minutes, eBay technicians were forced to shut down and reboot their local systems, making the company's Web site inaccessible from 8:55 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. EBay said it would credit listing fees for sellers affected by the failure and would extend their listing time for an additional 24 hours. The company also will reimburse the ''10 cents for 10 days'' fee for auctions that were active during the power failure. In the past, eBay has experienced failures that crippled the site for hours at a time. In 1999, the company suffered a number of problems that sometimes made the site inaccessible for nearly a day. Since then, the company has strengthened its back-end systems to prevent prolonged power failures.
7/18/2003	Tiny Treasures Leave Big Void In Looted Iraq	While there is still confusion about just how many objects were stolen from the Iraq Museum in Baghdad during the recent war, there is no doubt that one of its major collections is gone. In London last week, at an annual meeting of experts in archaeology, history and ancient languages of Mesopotamia, the museum's director, Dr. Nawala al-Mutawalli, said that 4,795 cylinder seals were missing. Col. Matthew Bogdanos of the Marines, leader of the American team investigating losses of antiquities in Iraq, confirmed the theft. ''It is a major loss,'' said McGuire Gibson, professor of Mesopotamian archaeology at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, who worked at Iraqi sites from 1964 to 1990. ''This is, or was, one of the world's really superb collections.''
6/30/2003	EBay Faithful Unshaken Despite Ever Slimmer Profits	As the recession has slowed industrial activity, Lloyd Graff has found one way to revive sales at his machine tools dealership: auctions on eBay. He has been able to find buyers for everything from $100 accessories to $55,000 precision rotary tools. It is great, he said, to reach many more customers. The only problem is the customers are far more informed about prices. ''EBay makes for a more efficient marketplace, and that leads to very compressed margins,'' Mr. Graff said. ''We just hope for a higher velocity of sales.''
6/26/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: Stamps.com Files Breach Of Contract Suit Against eBay	Stamps.com, which sells postage stamps over the Internet, has sued eBay and its PayPal electronic payment service, saying they breached a 2002 licensing agreement that would have permitted PayPal customers to use their accounts to buy stamps. The lawsuit was filed yesterday in a state court in Los Angeles, Stamps.com said. Stamps.com accused PayPal of not starting within a reasonable time a service that would have permitted PayPal customers to buy and print electronic postage onto envelopes, labels and documents. Stamps.com, which has about 300,000 customers, had $1.5 million in costs related to the venture, its chief executive, Kenneth McBride, said in an interview. Shares of Stamps.com declined 33 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $4.92.
6/19/2003	No Time for EBay? Here Come the Agents	AFTER making the switch from a five-bedroom house in Arizona to a two-bedroom Manhattan apartment, David and Eileen Garrahan found their closets a bit cluttered. A flyer they spotted in the laundry room of their apartment building promised relief, offering to help them convert treasures to cash on eBay without ever turning on a computer. The Garrahans bit.
6/12/2003	An Online Tag Sale Goes Uptown	EVERY year, arrivistes land in New York, freighted with bags of money earmarked for impressing one and all. The centerpiece of this effort is usually a showplace done by a top decorator and calculated to dazzle the locals. Last year, it was Richard and Lisa Perry, whose redo of a Sutton Place penthouse appeared over 10 pages in the September issue of Vogue. This season, it is Beekman Place, not Sutton. And it's not one designer, it's six. It's not the social scene's latest aspirants, it's eBay.
6/9/2003	E-Commerce Report; Incentive marketing spreads on the Internet, with offers of discounts or credit toward gifts.	THESE days, shoppers tend not to be satisfied with merely getting goods or services for their cash. Many want further positive reinforcement, in the form of airline miles, coupons and the like. Yet, while nearly three-quarters of the nation's households belong to rewards programs of some kind, according to the consulting firm Forrester Research, most of them do so only offline, because such offerings have been slow to emerge on the Web. That is now changing, though, as some of the Internet's biggest companies -- including eBay, LendingTree, USA Interactive and the music-sharing system KaZaA -- are turning their attention to loyalty programs.
5/30/2003	Ex-Wife Is Accused of Marketing Photos She Stole	The former wife of O. Winston Link, a photographer famed for dreamy pictures of trains, spent five years in prison for stealing 1,400 of his prints. The photos were never found, and throughout her trial and even after her release a year and a half ago, she never uttered a public word about their whereabouts. But a recent foray into the art market, the authorities said, has landed her back in jail.
5/28/2003	EBay Told to Pay $35 Million Over Patents	EBay Inc. was ordered to pay $35 million yesterday after a federal jury in Norfolk, Va., said that it was impermissibly using a company's innovations for conducting sales over the Internet. MercExchange of Great Falls, Va., accused eBay and its Half.com unit of infringing patents for the technology.
5/20/2003	From Unwanted Tower To a New Hit on EBay	Some things are just a little too expensive these days. For Sublimity, a rural town of 2,580 people in northern Oregon, dismantling the old water tower on Church Street is one of them. It would cost Sublimity roughly $20,000 to take down the tower, a 50,000-gallon tank built in 1948 and idle for the last four years after a new one was installed. With Oregon and the rest of the region as cash-poor as they are, that's a pretty penny for place like Sublimity.
5/19/2003	MediaTalk; Memorabilia for the Literary, Available on eBay	The auction site eBay, littered as it is with product specifications and price tags, is not generally considered a font of literary invention. But editors at two magazines have recently used eBay's e-commerce capabilities to some highly creative ends. Our first episode of contextual commerce begins with Alex Heard, the editorial director of Outside magazine. He was in possession of two items that were with Jon Krakauer, then a writer for Outside, when he went to the summit of Mount Everest on the ill-fated trip that became the subject first of a magazine article and then the book ''Into Thin Air.'' Mr. Heard decided to sell the items: a crampon, which is a boot attachment to aid in climbing, worn by Mr. Krakauer in the ascent, and a rabbit pelt, a piece of fur now with a dark, unlucky history, that was carried to the summit as a totem for his friends at Outside.
5/14/2003	Bucking the Tide, eBay Expands in Silicon Valley	Last month, eBay, the Internet auction company, brought some welcome news to a city and region that have been suffering from one of the worst office market slumps in the nation. The eight-year-old company, which had toyed with giving up its headquarters here, announced that it would not only keep its West San Jose complex but would also buy a 32-acre campus from the software developer Novell on the opposite side of town. The eBay deal, which still must undergo an environmental review, would allow the company to expand gradually, thereby avoiding the mistakes made by other highflying Silicon Valley companies that overcommitted themselves during the economic boom of the late 1990's and are now stuck with empty or only partly occupied buildings because of the slide in the technology industry.
4/24/2003	S.E.C. Is Advised to Take Action Against Couple	Officials in the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission have recommended that it file an insider trading suit against a former Wall Street analyst, Holly B. Becker, and her husband, Michael J. Zimmerman, a professional stock trader who has worked at several large hedge funds, according to a person involved in the investigation. The full commission is expected to decide Tuesday whether to file suit against Ms. Becker and Mr. Zimmerman, the person said.
4/9/2003	Is There Life After Silicon Valley's Fast Lane?	Silicon Valley's true believers are having second thoughts. If there is a religion here in the nation's high-technology heartland, its first commandment has long been Moore's Law, the 1965 observation by an Intel co-founder, Gordon E. Moore, that the number of transistors on a silicon chip would double annually. Dr. Moore later refined his projection, and the doubling rate has held to about every 18 months ever since, virtually dictating the pace of product obsolescence and innovation, and indeed the pace of life, in Silicon Valley.
3/7/2003	EBay to Shift Half.com Sales to Its Main Site	EBay Inc., the world's largest Internet auctioneer, will close Half.com and its Pennsylvania headquarters next year as it tries to shift sales to its main site. Half.com allows users to sell used books, music and videos at a fixed price.
2/20/2003	Technology Briefing | Internet: EBay To Open Service Center In Canada	EBay Inc., the Internet auctioneer, will open a service center in Burnaby, British Columbia, in April, and hire about 600 workers to handle queries from customers in the United States, Canada and Australia. EBay is adding the center near Vancouver as it seeks to increase revenue to $3 billion in 2005 from an estimated $1.9 billion this year. The new center will join those in Salt Lake City, Omaha and Germany. The new workers, who represent a 15 percent increase in eBay's work force of about 4,000, will be added over the next two to three years, a company spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said.
2/17/2003	E-Commerce Report; The Battle Over Collecting Taxes for Online Sales Turns Acrimonious	The online tax debate has suddenly become loud and bitter, with Wal-Mart Stores and Amazon.com as the leading antagonists. But the recent activity over Internet sales taxes may have only minimal impact on consumers and tax collectors, many retail executives and industry analysts say. That is because many of the biggest traditional merchants, including Sears, Roebuck; Gap; and Circuit City Stores, have long been collecting sales taxes from their online customers. And the biggest online tax resistors -- Amazon, eBay and Dell Computer -- seem unlikely to start collecting sales taxes any time soon.
2/9/2003	The Faithless Faith Worker	I am a member of the clergy (I will not identify the denomination), and I no longer believe in the tenets of my faith; indeed, I am an atheist. I am praised for my services, counseling, teaching, etc., and I receive glowing reports in staff reviews, but it is a futile, empty performance. On the one hand, my congregation is happy with me, but on the other, I feel like a fraud. Must I disclose my doubts to my congregation, knowing it would cost me my job? Anonymous Your unnamed denomination is the key to your question and your professional obligations. We don't demand that most workers be true believers, only that they do their jobs well. A librarian may detest the Library of Congress filing system and yearn for the forsaken Dewey Decimal. Even in a house of worship, we don't question the spirituality of the guy who repairs the synagogue's boiler or the woman who plays the church organ. But the clergy may be different. In some religions their essential task is to be a teacher and leader; in others, faith is the sine qua non.
2/6/2003	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Sotheby's Will Discontinue Auctions On Its Web Site	The auction house Sotheby's Holdings said that it would stop holding online auctions on its Web site, sothebys.ebay.com, which was built by and linked to eBay. The alliance between Sotheby's and eBay will end in May, officials said. ''As our online auctions offered by our dealer associates and Sotheby's have not generated a profit for Sotheby's, we are discontinuing separate online auctions,'' said William F. Ruprecht, president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. The company plans to continue operating a Web site, officials said, to provide details on its live auctions and for other company information. The auction house said that it had lost about $100 million on Internet operations in about three years. In June, Sotheby's started selling its fine art, antiques and other collectibles on the Web. But online sales did not meet company expectations; Sotheby's said it made about $135 million through its eBay-affiliated site.
2/2/2003	Rookie Free Agent Uses eBay To Try to Land Magazine Job	Editorial assistant, going cheap! Fed up with unreturned phone calls, ignored rsums and blanket hiring freezes, Marci Zitner decided to take her search for an entry-level job in magazine publishing to one marketplace where there's always a buyer: eBay.
1/17/2003	EBay Profits Rose Sharply In 4th Quarter	Benefiting from an aggressive campaign to position itself as a place to buy Christmas gifts, eBay posted sharply higher sales and profits in the fourth quarter of last year. EBay has long been the fastest growing and most profitable of the major Internet companies. During the last year, it has started to increase its revenue growth rate, which is unusual for a company its size.
1/15/2003	Fugitive in EBay Fraud Case Is Arrested	A fugitive accused of taking part in a fraudulent bidding ring on the eBay online auction service has been arrested in Wichita, Kan., and will be brought to trial in Sacramento. The fugitive, Kenneth Fetterman, 35, was indicted in March 2001 on federal charges of wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering in connection with attempts to auction fake artworks on eBay, including a painting purporting to be by Richard Diebenkorn that drew a bid for nearly $136,000.
1/12/2003	Virtual Property	Elizabeth Lapple, the seller: ''Bridgeville is the perfect thing. You can have control of the town, everyone who lives there, and you can have your own little paradise away from Los Angeles. My mother bought it in 1972. I inherited it. I decided to sell it because I realized that I could throw $5,000 or $10,000 at it here and there but I was never gonna have the money to fix it up. I sell a lot of stuff on eBay. The bidding started at $5,000. When it hit a million and a half I was like, is this real? Someone needs to pinch me! It worked its way up to $1,777,877. I have to admit: I enjoyed it. But then it got to a point where people were coming up to my children saying: 'Oh, your mother sold Bridgeville. Can you loan me 10 bucks?' I've had nine marriage proposals since the sale. They're like: 'You're really beautiful. Let's go somewhere and get married.' '' Benjamin French (background), graduate of Bridgeville School: ''I don't see why anyone would pay $1.7 million for this town. The only thing that's nice in Bridgeville is the school. Even though I live about 25 miles away now, my mom still teaches there. Lots of the buildings in town are run-down. There's no store because it's falling off a cliff. The land is awesome and you could do tons of stuff with it, but you'd have to get rid of the people who live there.''
12/26/2002	3-D Oohs and Aahs, the Old-School Way	FOR Eric Drysdale, the mundane task of clearing out some clutter from his wife's grandmother's apartment opened up, almost literally, a new dimension. ''I came across an old stereoscopic camera, a 3-D viewer and tons of 3-D images of her grandparents from the late 40's,'' said Mr. Drysdale, 34, a writer for ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central. ''My wife and I were blown away. I knew nothing about photography, but I began shooting 3-D photos immediately with the camera that had been sitting there for 50 years.''
12/19/2002	Mounting an Online Posse	FOR two years, Jason Eric Smith, a 21-year-old sophomore at the University of New Orleans, had been finding good deals on used Macintosh computers and then reselling them on eBay. Until a week before Thanksgiving, Mr. Smith's small enterprise ran smoothly, yielding just enough to pay the rent. Then a sale went terribly awry, leaving him a victim of a buyer's fraud. And in his outrage he persuaded fellow Mac users to take up his cause, turning themselves into sleuths armed with the Internet's power and reach.
12/14/2002	On eBay, No One Can Hear You Scream (Over High Price of Hot Toys)	Td49244, known to some of his hundreds of satisfied customers as Santa Tony, has three dozen jovial Chicken Dance Elmos staring him down in his Staten Island basement, but he is hardly unnerved. He takes the long view and will not sell short, at least through Dec. 25. Toys-as-commodities are a big game for him, as he watches the fickle fluctuations of the market for fun.
12/14/2002	A Retailing Mix: On Internet, in Print and in Store	In 1999, as online sales were beginning to take off, Lands' End decided that it could mail fewer catalogs and encourage customers to shop on the Internet. Sales lagged, and by the next year it was mailing as many catalogs as ever. By this year, the Internet will represent 30 percent of Lands' End's holiday sales, up from 25 percent last year. And the company, now owned by Sears, Roebuck, is still going to mail 270 million catalogs. Many customers, it turns out, buy from each at different times and for different reasons.
12/10/2002	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Ebay and Autotrader Will End Partnership Early	EBay Inc., the world's largest Internet auctioneer, and AutoTrader.com will end their partnership on Jan. 1, six months earlier than planned, and become competitors in online vehicle auctions. EBay sold its 2.6 percent stake in closely held AutoTrader.com, an eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said in a statement, without providing details. EBay paid $9.24 million for the shares in 2000, according to an AutoTrader.com filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither company would say why the relationship is ending early. AutoTrader.com will begin offering its own automobile auctions next month, a spokeswoman, Lisa Uhl, said. AutoTrader.com, which provided some of the vehicle listings for eBay, received about 50 percent of the revenue generated from the listings, said Steve Weinstein, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities. Shares of eBay fell $1.07, to $67.47. EBay probably will keep current customers and benefit from continued growth in the number of cars sold on line, Mr. Weinstein said. EBay Motors was the most popular automotive site in October with 8.87 million visitors, according to ComScore Networks Inc.'s Media Metrix unit. AutoTrader.com, which says it lists vehicles from 40,000 dealers and 250,000 individuals, was the seventh-most popular with 4.28 million visitors.
12/6/2002	Online Bid Is Made, Briefly, to Save Dartmouth's Swim Team From Budget Cuts	Lots of unusual things show up on eBay, but Item 1976909200, listed on Monday, is a real standout: the Dartmouth College NCAA Division I swim team. Just before Thanksgiving, Dartmouth told its 53 varsity swimmers that it was eliminating the men's and women's swimming and diving teams next year, as part of the universitywide budget cuts forced by a shrinking endowment.
12/4/2002	National Briefing | South: Arkansas: Purloined Faulkner Letters	A man charged with stealing letters written by the Nobel laureate William Faulkner surrendered to the police at Little Rock on Monday. The man, Robert Hardin Smith of Jacksonville, Ark., is accused of taking the documents from the Center for Faulkner Studies at Southeast Missouri State University at Cape Girardeau and then posting them for sale on e-Bay. The university says all six stolen letters had been found and their return assured. Mr. Smith has three prior convictions for stealing documents.
11/25/2002	E-Commerce Report; EBay is the Internet's retailing success story. So why are some people making cautionary noises?	EBAY, the online auction house, remains the undisputed champion of e-commerce, with a stock market value ($21.6 billion as of Friday's close) that is more than double that of Amazon. It also has a dearth of serious competitors and a coterie of investment analysts who cheer eBay's every move. And yet there exists a small group of Wall Street analysts with the gall to put a ''hold'' rating on eBay's stock, while other industry trackers have recently sprinkled their eBay praise with cautionary notes.
11/20/2002	National Briefing | Midwest: Michigan: Bidding Up A Hip-Hop House	A house that was a sometime home to the rapper Marshall Mathers, also known as Eminem, has attracted more than 100 bids on eBay, some offering more than $600,000. The wood-frame house in Warren, a Detroit suburb, which belonged to Mr. Mathers's grandmother, was appraised at $91,000. It was sold to Sebastian Lucido by Mr. Mathers's uncle, Todd Nelson, for $45,000 the day before this month's premiere of ''8 Mile,'' a film based on Mr. Mathers's life. Mr. Lucido offered the home on eBay and is sorting through the nonbinding bids for a serious offer.
11/19/2002	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: EBay Opens Electronics Store	EBay Inc., the world's biggest Internet auctioneer, has opened an electronics store and will offer free shipping for products including DVD players and video cameras. EBay Electronics will sell new and used merchandise, including refurbished items and excess inventory from manufacturers and retailers, the company said in a statement. EBay said it expected electronics sales to rise 57 percent this year, to $2.2 billion from $1.4 billion last year. Shares of eBay, based in San Jose, Calif., rose $1.67, to $67.64.
11/18/2002	New Group Urges F.C.C. to Alter Internet Broadband Policy	A group of technology and media companies including Microsoft, Disney Yahoo and eBay plans to send a letter to the Federal Communications Commission today arguing that the open nature of the Internet will be lost unless the agency amends its broadband policy. The formation of the group signals a growing fear that the F.C.C., in an effort to spur investment in broadband Internet services, is ceding control to a handful of cable and phone companies over a network long seen as inherently immune to controlling influences.
10/29/2002	Handbag Maker Takes Aim at Knockoffs	When housewives in the suburbs began selling Kate Spade knockoffs at ''purse parties'' -- and telling the police they couldn't be doing anything illegal because they were careful to tell their customers they were fake -- Andy Spade knew the company had to take some serious action. Mr. Spade, the president and creative director -- and husband of the designer the company is named for -- announced yesterday that Kate Spade had hired Barbara Kolsun, the former chairwoman of the board of the International Anticounterfeiting Coalition, as senior vice president and general counsel.
10/27/2002	Cold War Charm and Hot Tub: Silo Site Fetches $2.1 Million	A converted missile silo site has been sold for $2.1 million in an online auction to a couple who are getting an Adirondack getaway home with a Jacuzzi, three-foot-thick walls and some cold war charm. The owners had marketed the site as a ''safe haven'' for dangerous times. ''The complex, accessible via its own private paved airstrip, offers the optimum level of security and privacy available today,'' read the description of the property, which was offered through the eBay Internet auction site.
10/18/2002	73% Bounce Makes EBay an E-Commerce Bright Spot	EBay, the Internet auction giant, announced continuing growth yesterday, with nearly $264 million in net revenue from transactions in the third quarter, 73 percent higher than the figures for the period a year ago. The chief executive said that eBay might have gotten a helping hand from the same economic troubles that have made a boneyard of the dot-com marketplace.
10/10/2002	Peddling Junk on EBay	To the Editor: Re ''How Not to Sell Obscure Junk on EBay'' (Online Shopper, Oct. 3): I recently sold a stretching table (don't ask) for $200 on eBay. It was just over the size limits for United Parcel Service and FedEx. Shipping by truck would have cost $150 or more. But a Mail Boxes Etc. clerk pointed me to Greyhound. My 25-by-25-by-40-foot 45-pound box cost $49 to ship, insured, via Greyhound bus from Austin to Los Angeles. It got there in two days. You can drop it off at your bus station, and the recipient picks it up at his or her bus station. GARY DAVIS Austin
10/10/2002	Peddling Junk on EBay	To the Editor: Re ''How Not to Sell Obscure Junk on EBay'' (Online Shopper, Oct. 3): I'm considering writing to the Ethicist column of The New York Times Magazine regarding the way in which your writer enhanced her eBay auction by stealing someone else's photograph. When I list an item on eBay, I have to take the picture, have it developed, scan it, enhance it and upload it to eBay. That takes time and money. Can she tell me how she justifies snatching someone else's image? VALERIE CLARKE New York
10/4/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: eBay Closes Paypal Deal	eBay, the world's largest Internet auctioneer, completed the $1.5 billion purchase of an electronic payments company, Paypal, yesterday. EBay said Matt Bannick, a senior vice president, would assume the duties previously handled by PayPal's chief executive, Peter Thiel, who resigned.The purchase closed after PayPal shareholders approved the swap of each of their shares for 0.39 share of EBay common stock, EBay said. Paypal shareholders also approved the purchase yesterday. Shares of eBay, based in San Jose, Calif., fell $1.40, to $51.90 on the Nasdaq. Paypal, based in Mountain View, Calif., fell 53 cents, to $20.22.
10/3/2002	Panel's Report Offers Details On 'Spinning' Of New Stocks	A Congressional committee is accusing the Goldman Sachs Group and two other investment banks of rewarding senior executives of their corporate clients with preferential allocations of new stocks, according to a committee document obtained yesterday. The House Financial Services Committee found that executives of about 20 companies, including the chief executive of eBay and a founder of Yahoo, received shares of initial public offerings from Goldman Sachs in a practice known on Wall Street as ''spinning,'' the report says. Margaret Whitman, eBay's chief executive and a director of Goldman Sachs, was among the officers and directors who ''flipped,'' or quickly sold, shares of new stocks for quick profits, the report says.
10/3/2002	How Not to Sell Obscure Junk on EBay	CLEARLY, the smart thing to do before listing various obscure items on eBay last week would have been to take my friend Dana's advice. After all, Dana is the sort of experienced eBay seller who has shipped nearly 400 items -- including a full set of vintage Homer Laughlin dishes -- across the country with minimal breakage. Her auction descriptions successfully lure bidders even to such obscure items as an old metal Thermos (a ''classic plaid design,'' she wrote) or a porcelain Christmas bell figure Yule log (''clapper intact'').
9/29/2002	Long After the Atlas, a Shrug: Missile Site Draws No Bidders	The house in the Adirondacks has a Jacuzzi, an airstrip, an underground living space and even its own missile silo. But so far it has no takers. An auction for the converted missile site began on eBay last month with a minimum price of $2.1 million. When it closed on Wednesday without a single bid, the owners decided to slash the price drastically and try again.
9/17/2002	For Sale Upstate: Home and Underground Silo (Missile Extra)	For sale: In beautiful Adirondack Park, just 20 minutes from golf courses and ski areas, the ultimate in mountain luxury. Three bedrooms, three baths, septic system, Jacuzzi and seven-story underground missile silo designed to absorb the shock of a direct nuclear hit. All this and more, including a private airstrip, may be yours if you are the high bidder in an eBay auction that ends Sept. 25.
8/21/2002	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: U.S. Clears Purchase Of Paypal	EBay's $1.5 billion purchase of the online payment service PayPal was cleared by antitrust regulators, eliminating a potential barrier to the transaction. The Justice Department ended its review without asking for more information, eBay, the largest online auctioneer, said yesterday. Some analysts had expected regulators to delay the sale while it sought more data. Shares of PayPal, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., rose $2.10 each, or 10 percent, to $23.10; eBay shares fell $1.45, to $60.41. PayPal's competitors include a smaller service operated by eBay. PayPal, which lets users make payments electronically from banks and credit cards, estimated last year that 71 percent of eBay auctions listed it as a payment option. The acquisition, announced July 8, needs approval from PayPal stockholders.
8/6/2002	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Sprint And Ebay In Calling-Card Venture	The Sprint Corporation will sell prepaid calling cards on eBay, the two companies said yesterday. An increasingly popular payment method for long-distance telephone calls, prepaid telephone cards represent one of the few growth areas in telecommunications. Sprint will offer 120-minute and 480-minute cards for 4.5 cents a domestic minute and a 25-pack of 480-minute cards for 4.2 cents a domestic minute, the company, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., said. Sprint began the calling card promotion with the donation of a million prepaid domestic minutes that will be given to a camp for children with chronic or life-threatening illnesses. Late last year, the two companies announced that eBay would use Sprint technology to expand Ebay's Web hosting facilities. Shares in Sprint, which reported earnings last month that were slightly below Wall Street expectations, ended the day lower, falling 11 cents, to $6.39. Andrew Zipern (NYT)

''Jerry Marcus, a tall, soft-spoken accountant from Queens, New York, already had 1,500 clothing irons, but he was hunched over his computer at home, bidding on one more.''
7/19/2002	EBay Earnings Up as Revenue Sets Record	The online auction giant eBay Inc. continued its lonesome Internet success story, announcing higher second-quarter sales and profits yesterday, with strong growth in the United States and overseas markets. ''I am very excited about eBay's future, because the company has a lot more room to grow,'' Margaret C. Whitman, the chief executive, said during a conference call.
7/16/2002	'All-American' S.&P. 500 Drawing Protests	Nobody likes to be shown the door. But the companies about to be dropped from the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks are finding the move especially galling because of the stated reason: They aren't American enough. Standard & Poor's said last Tuesday evening that effective after this trading week, seven prominent companies will be removed from the index -- Nortel Networks, Barrick Gold, Inco, Alcan and Placer Dome, all of Canada, and two British-Dutch groups, Royal Dutch Petroleum and Unilever. They will make way for the United Parcel Service, the Goldman Sachs Group, Prudential Financial, the Principal Financial Group, eBay, Electronic Arts and SunGard Data Systems, all with headquarters in the United States.
7/15/2002	Compressed Data; Online Bets Are Becoming Harder to Collect	Online casinos are finding it ever more difficult to cash out. Indeed, these Web sites are likely to feel an indirect, but not insignificant, impact from the announcement last week that the online auctioneer eBay intends to acquire PayPal, a system people use to make payments over the Internet.
7/10/2002	THE MARKETS: Market Place; S.& P. 500 drops 7 foreigners, maybe aiding market over all.	THE Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is going all-American, and in the process it is producing a little bit of buying power for the struggling stock market. In its largest change in years, S.& P., a unit of McGraw-Hill, announced that it was dropping the seven companies in the index that are not based in the United States -- a move that involved replacing two companies that have been in the index for more than six decades.
7/9/2002	EBay to Buy PayPal, a Rival in Online Payments	The online auction giant eBay announced plans today to acquire PayPal, a rapidly growing start-up that lets people make payments via e-mail. The move will let eBay take a bigger share of many sales made on its own site, and to expand its business to earn money on tens of thousands of transactions made elsewhere on the Internet. The $1.5 billion deal, which was negotiated and completed in a week, brings together two companies that are already intertwined, and that have been among the few Internet companies left thriving. PayPal is widely used to transact business by buyers and sellers on eBay, a situation that, before this deal, created both interdependency but also rivalry between the two businesses.
6/27/2002	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Appeals Court Upholds EBay Ruling	EBay is not liable if people sell fake merchandise on its site, a California appeals court ruled yesterday. The court affirmed a local court ruling last year in a case brought by people who bought baseballs and other items on eBay with forged signatures of baseball players. The court accepted the company's argument that a portion of federal communications law exempts Internet service providers from liability for actions of third parties -- in this case, dealers that posted auctions for the forged goods. It ruled that the federal law supersedes several California statues that otherwise might have made the online auction company certify the authenticity of sports-related collectibles sold on its site. Saul Hansell (NYT)
5/30/2002	12 Bids? Goodbye, Old Rust Bucket	AT the risk of hurting my 1989 Honda Civic's feelings, let me remind you of how unsightly the car was. It was a curious beige color that reminded me of someone who smears on liquid foundation to try to look natural. Add to that the accumulation of the years -- a rusty rear wheel, a dent near the driver's door, a scratch in the windshield -- and you can see why my husband rarely bothered to lock it when he parked it at the train station in the morning.
5/26/2002	On eBay, New Jersey's Garage Sale	IT'S the time of year when New Jerseyans learn far more than they want to about their neighbors, thanks to that great late-spring tradition, the garage sale. Why, exactly, do the Johnsons have 16 slightly used flea collars to sell even though they have never owned a pet? What are we to make of the well-thumbed copy of ''Marijuana Hydroponics'' being offered by the Wilkersons? From there it's a short step to wondering what kind of face New Jersey is presenting to the rest of the world in the international garage sale, the online auction site eBay.com. After exhaustive research involving literally dozens of minutes in front of my computer, I have arrived at this conclusion: We are a bunch of sports-addicted, rat- and deer-hating postcard writers.
5/24/2002	Yahoo Drops Auctions in Most of Europe	Failing to eclipse its major rival in the online auction market overseas, Yahoo said today that it would stop offering its own auctions in six European countries and promote eBay's service instead. The decision mirrors an important change that has been reshaping the online industry since the burst of the Internet bubble as companies are forced to choose between businesses that are likely to produce profits and those that are not.
5/16/2002	Replacing Cherished Shoes	To the Editor: Re ''If the Shoe Fits, Buy Two Pairs'' (Online Shopper, May 2): Your writer's search for replacement nubuck Mephisto shoes discarded in her neatness crusade overlooked an obvious source: eBay. She might even have been able to locate them to match the wear and tear the shoes sustained while on her husband's feet. EBay shoes have the advantage of being broken in and cost much less than when they were new. JOAN MARY MACEY Binghamton, N.Y.
5/11/2002	EBAY TO PAY AOL LESS IN AMENDED COMMISSION AGREEMENT	EBay said it would pay less to AOL Time Warner after renegotiating an advertising sales and marketing agreement last month. EBay will pay a maximum of $15 million in the agreement's first renewal year, rather than the $18.8 million it was to have paid in the period, which ends March 23, 2004, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. AOL provides online advertising and marketing services for eBay. EBay is a provider of online trading services on AOL sites, and the companies have a co-branded Web site. The companies adjusted the commission structure for advertising sales and shortened the term of the agreement to March 31, 2003, from its previous termination at the end of next year. EBay will pay $10 million if the contract is extended for the year ending March 23, 2005.
5/5/2002	Investing; New Game Is Played Online For Topps	''YOU root for them. You believe in them. Now invest in them.'' The Topps Company, which makes bubblegum, candy and trading cards, has been making that televised appeal to baseball fans in an effort to create an online boom in card collecting. In ads running during ballgames in New York, Seattle and other markets, the company directs fans to its etopps.com Web site.
5/5/2002	Meg Whitman and eBay, Net Survivors	TEN heads nodded in unison around a long conference table as Rob Veres pointed to a large computer display. The scene was the latest of eBay's ''Voice of the Customer'' sessions, a brainchild of its chief executive, Meg Whitman. A cross-section of those who buy and sell over this huge online bazaar had been invited to eBay's headquarters here to spend two days talking to its executives. In one session, Mr. Veres, a product manager, showed proposed improvements to a feature called ''Mr. Lister,'' which lets users put dozens of items up for sale at the same time. There were murmurs of praise. Then Mr. Veres brought up an option that would let sellers specify that an auction would not start until a later date.
4/29/2002	E-Commerce Report; The success of eBay is spawning a number of online liquidation houses.	THE short history of the Internet is littered with companies that tried to act as incubators for new online businesses, nearly all of which failed. But there is one de facto incubator still helping to spawn new online companies: its name is eBay. Since its founding nearly seven years ago, eBay has given impetus to e-payment services, online escrow businesses and countless small companies set up to sell goods that might never have found a market without eBay.
4/19/2002	EBay's Rapid Growth Beats Expectations	EBay, the big Internet bazaar, reported today that its rapid and profitable growth continued in the first quarter, barely slowed by the drag that has hampered many other Internet companies. EBay earned $47.6 million in the quarter, up 125 percent from a year ago. The company posted revenue of $245 million, up 59 percent. Both measures were slightly ahead of analysts' expectations.
4/8/2002	E-Commerce Report; The three big Internet portals begin to distinguish among themselves as shopping malls.	YAHOO and MSN have worked hard at catching up to America Online in recent years, at least as far as their online shopping malls go. The three portals now feature many of the same marquee retailers, offering the same merchandise, frequently at the same prices. Not surprisingly, they attract the same types of people -- in their mid-40's, with household incomes around $65,000 and annual online spending of about $450. So why would so many retailers continue to throw advertising money at all three?
3/26/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay Says Inquiry Is Closed	EBay, the online auction house, said in its annual report that the Justice Department had ended its antitrust investigation of the company without taking any action. In 1999, eBay sued a Massachusetts company, Bidder's Edge, asserting that the company had trespassed on eBay's computer servers when it listed eBay's search results on BiddersEdge.com. Bidder's Edge denied the claim and accused eBay of violating antitrust laws by monopolizing or trying to monopolize a market. In March 2001, the companies settled the dispute for an undisclosed sum. The inquiry examined eBay's licensing program and the lawsuit against Bidder's Edge. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
3/10/2002	Priceline and eBay Join in New Service	In an effort to expand its travel business, the online auction site eBay has teamed up with Priceline.com to create a new travel booking service. The eBay travel section, which has been around for a little over a year, offers an eclectic range of items for sale from individuals and travel suppliers. Recent listings include a tee time for four at a golf course in Arizona, a seven-day New England-Canada cruise for two on Carnival Cruise Lines, and a week at a two-bedroom condominium near Lake Tahoe.
3/7/2002	Seeking Satisfaction; Once Bamboozled, Now a Bloodhound: On the Trail, Online	CONSIDER them a band of auction-fraud vigilantes. Greg Harrington is one of a group of 10 former auction victims who spend hours every week ferreting out fraudulent auctions on Yahoo and eBay.
3/7/2002	Malcolm X Family Fights Auction of Papers	A cache of personal writings attributed to Malcolm X has turned up for auction in San Francisco and on eBay, infuriating members of his family who are trying to stop the sale and alarming scholars who worry that the material could disappear into private hands. The documents, of incalculable historical value if authentic, are to be sold on March 20 in an auction to be held simultaneously at the San Francisco offices of Butterfields, an auction house owned by eBay, and on the Internet. They include a vast trove of letters, photographs, diaries, handwritten drafts of speeches and Malcolm X's personal Koran. Altogether, the materials amount to hundreds of pages and cover two decades of Malcolm X's life, until shortly before his assassination at the Audubon Ballroom in New York on Feb. 21, 1965. The archive is expected to bring in a total of between $300,000 and $500,000.
2/27/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay Exits Japan For Taiwan	The online auction company eBay said it planned to buy a Web site in Taiwan, but also announced an intended pullout from Japan after failing to crack the market dominated by Yahoo Japan. EBay agreed to buy NeoCom Technology, which runs the popular Taiwan Web sites ubid.com.tw and bid.com.tw, for $9.5 million in cash and an additional sum to be determined when the deal closes. The deal is expected to lower second-quarter earnings by a penny a share, to 16 cents. Even as it entered Taiwan, Asia's third-largest e-commerce market, eBay said it would close its operations in Japan on March 31, laying off its 17 employees there. Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for eBay, said the company had considered partnerships and acquisitions to improve its position, but had decided that Yahoo Japan, a partnership between the American company and the Japanese conglomerate Softbank, was too potent. ''We were late into the market, and they did a much better job at executing on their game plan,'' Mr. Pursglove said. Chris Gaither (NYT)
2/17/2002	The Nation; Taking Enron Scraps to Auction	MOST office workers are familiar with them -- the spongy squeezeballs and coffee mugs, the calculators and desk calendars bearing the logo of whatever conglomerated amalgamation happens to sign the checks. A new-hire orientation, for instance, might yield a tote bag. A job well done might earn a glass paperweight with the company's logo suspended in the center. And while all this boosterish debris rarely transforms wage slaves into loyal corporate argonauts, who doesn't like a new yo-yo? Enron knew the answer to that question as well as any American corporation.
2/2/2002	EBAY AND PRICELINE.COM TO SHARE TRAVEL SALES	EBay and Priceline.com said they would collaborate for online sales of airline tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals. Priceline.com, a leading provider of online travel services, will supply travel products, computer infrastructure and transaction processing for a new booking service through eBay's travel site, a Priceline.com spokesman, Brian Ek, said. Shoppers on the eBay travel page will be able to do so by either a ''name your own price'' system or through a ''buy it now'' feature. The companies said that the new venture should generate increased revenue. Priceline.com will gain access to eBay's 42.4 million users and eBay, which is expanding into new sales categories, will broaden the offerings on its new travel pages.
1/31/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Sotheby's And Ebay Plan Venture	EBay and Sotheby's said they would join forces to create a new auction Web site that allows for live online auctions of items sold in Sotheby's showrooms. The site will be a newly designed version of Sothebys.com, into which will be folded eBay's Premier site, a section that focuses on expensive collectibles and requires users to put credit card numbers on file. EBay will build the new site and the company's auction technology will be used to manage the bidding and selling process, whether for live auctions or auctions that take place over a set number of days. By the summer, officials said, online users will be able to participate in some of Sotheby's auctions at the same time as those who are sitting in the auction halls. ''People will be able to see on their monitors, in real time, the action in the showroom,'' said David Redden, vice chairman of Sotheby's and chairman of Sotheby's.com. Officials would not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Lisa Guernsey (NYT)
1/20/2002	Design Line Online	Fashion lovers who prefer to buy -- their Pucci and Calvin Klein on the auction block have a new place in which to browse. EBay has introduced a new online column, Phillip's Fashion Finds, by Phillip Bloch, the Hollywood stylist. ''Just think of me as a cruise director of sorts,'' Mr. Bloch said. ''I'll be offering shopping tips, highlighting hot items and pointing out trends I've noticed.'' This week, he discusses bustiers and recommends eBay shops like Guccigranny's Closet. And there is a new list of designers, organized alphabetically, whose designs are on the auction site -- under D, for instance, a Dolce & Gabbana purple sequined bustier for $36 and a Dries van Noten embroidered coat, straight off the runway, for $375. Mr. Bloch said eBay was a great way to assess value. Since Yves Saint Laurent announced his retirement on Jan. 7, for example, a flood of his designs has come up for sale, ''although buyers and sellers are being cautious,'' he said. For a peek, log on to www.eBay.com, click on clothing and accessories and then on designer boutique.
1/18/2002	For Auction Online: Enron's Memos	A former Enron employee was selling a 64-page cache of internal Enron Corporation memorandums on eBay today. One memo from the company's chairman at the time, Kenneth L. Lay, read, ''Our growth has never been more certain.'' In another, Mr. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, discuss ''values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.'' The going auction price this evening was $18.27.
1/16/2002	Profit at EBay Increased 8% Last Quarter	EBay Inc., the Internet auctioneer, said today that its fourth-quarter profit rose more than 8 percent as buyers and sellers used its Web site for holiday gifts. The company also said that online advertising sales growth would slow in the first half of the year. EBay did not raise its earnings forecast, as some investors had expected.
12/23/2001	Season's Biddings	Last week I got a package from a very nice lady who lives on the West Coast. Inside, I found a lovingly wrapped wool plaid shirt, just my size, in my favorite colors, with a handwritten note on a small card. The shirt fit perfectly, and when I raised the sleeve to my face I could smell not the newness of the new -- so formerly intoxicating -- but something else entirely. It was a perfume of untraceable subtleties, the kind of scent that made me wish I were a hound dog, able to discern in just what proportions the aromas of laundry soap and laundry room, of closet, kitchen and the humans who lived there, intermingled in the cloth. From that odor, I almost knew the house the shirt had come from. If it had been mailed 40 years ago, it could have come from my aunt's house in Des Moines, a hand-me-down from a cousin. But this package came from a total stranger. I had won the shirt on eBay. I'm late to eBay, and I know it. By the time I began bidding on eBay auctions earlier this autumn, the number of registered users had reached 30 million, and each of them was spending more time on eBay than on almost any other Internet site. What began six years ago as a straightforward online auction service, designed to help ordinary people sell each other the minutiae of ordinary life, has grown into one of the few unwaveringly profitable Internet businesses, affected only briefly by the implosion in tech stocks and Sept. 11. It has become the souk of souks.
11/26/2001	Compressed Data; Professors Study Method for Doing Well on EBay	Trying to put markets for everything under the sun -- think groceries and pet food -- on the Internet was a demonstrably bad idea. But clearly, there are some markets made for the online medium, like the virtual auctions managed by eBay. Price discovery, in economic terms, is easy and open, a wealth of data can be presented, and transaction costs are low. Those very characteristics work to the advantage of researchers, especially those like Charles Wood, an assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, who was a software developer before joining academia. Mr. Wood wrote a nifty little Java program, called eDrill, to automate the collection of data off the Web. He and Robert Kauffman, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's graduate school of management, then embarked on a study of coin auctions on eBay, from 1999 to 2001.
11/8/2001	Palm Beach Is Selling Its Voting Machines	An infamous bit of political Americana went on the block today, with an online auction site offering to the public 3,055 of Palm Beach County's Votomatic voting machines and the ''butterfly ballots'' that prompted accusations of misdirected voting in last year's presidential election. The county is selling the machines on eBay, the online auction house, where bidding opened at $300 and is to continue until Nov. 17.
10/30/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay Optimistic About Revenue	EBay Inc., the largest Internet auctioneer, said yesterday that it was on track to increase revenue by 50 percent next year and meet its 2005 revenue goal of $3 billion as it expands into more categories and regions. EBay ''remains confident'' in its revenue projections for 2005 as well as for next year, Meg Whitman, the chief executive, said in a presentation to analysts and investors. EBay's 2002 revenue was forecast to rise 40 percent, to $1.03 billion from this year's projected $737.5 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.
10/21/2001	Auctions Offer a Chance To Get Sports Collectibles	Your mother threw away your 1964 Topps set? You traded a 1969 Roberto Clemente for a pal's stick of gum? Now's your chance to get them back. Starting next week, One If By Cards, Two If By Comics, the collectibles store on Central Park Avenue in Scarsdale since 1992, will be offering an array of rare memorabilia via telephone and eBay auctions.
10/19/2001	EBay Continues to Flourish Despite Faltering Economy	Continuing to fly above the wreckage of the Internet economy and the uncertainty of the broader retail world, eBay posted sales and profits for the third quarter yesterday that exceeded analysts' expectations. EBay, the huge online auction house, earned $18.8 million, up 24 percent from the period a year earlier. Its sales were $194.4 million, up 71 percent, and above analysts' forecasts of $189 million.
10/16/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Offers a Bargain Basement	With shoppers interested in little other than the bargain basement, Yahoo, the Internet portal, said yesterday that it would open Yahoo Warehouse for used and discounted merchandise. The service, which will begin in late October, is modeled after eBay's Half.com, which lets individuals and businesses sell goods at fixed prices rather than through auctions. Yahoo declined to specify the cost to merchants to sell through its new service, but said its commission will be less than that of Half.com, which charges 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on the price of the item. Yahoo also said it would redesign its shopping site to allow users to search for items. Saul Hansell (NYT)
10/2/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay President Joins Goldman Board	The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it had named Meg Whitman, the chief executive and president of eBay Inc. to its board, bringing the total to nine. Ms. Whitman is the fifth outsider on Goldman's board, which was created when the company went public in 1999. The insiders include the chief executive, Henry Paulson; the co-presidents, John Thain and John Thornton; and Robert Hurst, vice chairman.
9/28/2001	BOLDFACE NAMES	An Auctioneer's Day MEG WHITMAN, the president and chief executive of eBay, had a busy morning yesterday: DIANE SAWYER and CHARLES GIBSON gave her a piece of the ''Good Morning America'' set -- a folk-art flag -- and a photograph of MUHAMMAD ALI helping them hang it above the fireplace. Then Ms. Whitman opened the trading day at the Nasdaq market site, a block from the ABC studio in Times Square. Then, another interview.
9/16/2001	A Ban on Memorabilia Auctions	EBay sells just about everything on its Internet auction site, but out of deference to the victims of the terrorist attacks, it has temporarily banned sales related to the World Trade Center or the Pentagon. On Tuesday, the day of the attacks, the company said its site managers initially removed several listings offering debris or other items purportedly from the buildings. As the day progressed, it said, the ban was extended to anything related to the buildings, including postcards, posters and other collectibles.
9/6/2001	Palm (the Butter Version) Is Up for Auction at EBay	Butter-sculpture fans, rejoice: The Butter Palm VII P.D.A. sculpture from this year's Minnesota State Fair is for sale at eBay. Rebooting this particular Palm may be a bit messy, but it certainly tastes better than those plastic models. The 50-pound buttery wonder, sculptured by Linda Christensen (who has been carving the likeness of the fair's annual dairy princess from butter for years), made its worldwide debut on Aug. 23 at the fair booth sponsored by Gearworks, a wireless applications company based near Minneapolis. ''Hey, a Palm Pilot carved into a big block of butter would be fun,'' said Rob Davis, director of partner marketing at Gearworks, recalling discussions about what to display in the company booth. Palm liked the idea so much that it donated a Palm VII hand-held as a raffle prize.
9/6/2001	EBay Chooses I.B.M. Net Software as Cornerstone Technology	I.B.M. will announce today that eBay Inc., the big online auction house, has chosen I.B.M.'s Internet software as its new building-block technology. The Silicon Valley company decided to use I.B.M.'s technology over offerings by Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, BEA and others, after a fierce competition over the last three months. EBay is an outstanding exception among Internet commerce companies -- large, fast-growing and solidly profitable. ''EBay is the poster child, so you want to get them as a customer,'' said Mike Gilpin, an analyst for Giga Information Group.
8/22/2001	Suits Dismissed Against Morgan Stanley	A federal judge dismissed shareholder lawsuits against Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and the analyst Mary Meeker, saying the complaints were ''an entangled mass of verbiage'' filled with ''market gossip.'' The lawsuits, filed Aug. 1 in Manhattan federal court by investors in the Internet auctioneer Ebay and the retailer Amazon.com, accused Ms. Meeker of offering biased research and slanted investment advice about the Internet companies to secure lucrative banking business for Morgan Stanley, the No. 2 retail brokerage company after Merrill Lynch.
8/17/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Jet Sale Sets Record On Ebay	A Gulfstream II business jet sold on eBay for $4.9 million, the highest price paid for any item on the company's online auction sites. The aircraft was one of several offered by Tyler Jet on eBay's aviation site, an eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said.
8/15/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay Extends Pact With AOL	EBay, the online auctioneer, and AOL Time Warner said the two companies would expand AOL's promotion of eBay and extend the alliance for three more years. AOL, based in Dulles, Va., has promoted eBay through its online service for several years, but AOL's merger with Time Warner gave the company a range of new advertising opportunities, including Fortune, Time and People magazines and the cable TV channels TNT and CNN. The announcement comes six months after eBay struck a similar deal with Microsoft to promote the auction service on its online properties. EBay paid AOL $75 million in 1999; the companies would not disclose the financial terms of the current deal. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
8/13/2001	E-Commerce Report; The fallen dot-coms are not yet cold, but some dealers are already selling their detritus as memorabilia.	WHEN life is paced in Internet time, even nostalgia arrives faster than it did in the good old days. Only months, or even weeks, after some well-known Web merchants shut down, collectors are already paying hundreds of dollars on eBay for mementos like eToys stock certificates and boxes of T-shirts and other trinkets bearing the names of Kozmo, Webvan, Pets.com and other defunct mainstays of the e-commerce craze.
8/8/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay Buys Home-Sales Site	The Internet auction company eBay said it had acquired HomesDirect, a company that specializes in auctions of foreclosed properties. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. HomesDirect has sold approximately 58,000 homes this year at prices ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. The company earns money by providing the auction platform to government agencies like the Veterans Administration. Ebay started a real estate division in August 2000 that auctions property and time shares. Catherine Greenman (NYT)
8/3/2001	Morgan Stanley and Analyst Sued Over Advice	Two lawsuits filed yesterday in federal district court accused Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and one of its analysts, Mary Meeker, of defrauding investors in the Internet auctioneer eBay Inc. and the online retailer Amazon.com. In the lawsuits, investors asserted that Ms. Meeker offered biased research and slanted investment advice about eBay and Amazon.com as a way to secure banking business for Morgan Stanley, the No. 2 retail brokerage firm after Merrill Lynch.
7/25/2001	From 'Eight Men Out' to EBay: Shoeless Joe's Bat	The story is told about the time a certain man walked into a liquor store in West Greenville, S.C., that was owned by Shoeless Joe Jackson, who some two decades earlier had been banned from baseball. Jackson, along with seven of his White Sox teammates, had been accused of throwing the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds for the sake of gamblers. ''Can I help you?'' Jackson asked the customer.
7/25/2001	Technology Briefing | Software: Ebay Seeks Large Sellers	In an effort to attract large sellers, eBay is designating auction software companies to help provide logistical services for high-volume sales. The companies will provide software that will help sellers with the billing, tracking and shipping of items. The program, Preferred Provider Program, will start with a dedicated section on eBay's Web site over the next three to six weeks, eBay said. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)
7/19/2001	Mining a Dot-Com Disaster for EBay Sales	INTERNET stocks remain pariahs on Wall Street, but on eBay, the smart money is moving into beleaguered dot-coms. Take Webvan, the online grocery service, for example. Last week, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and ended operation after spending almost $1.2 billion in startup capital. Many of Webvan's long-suffering investors were left holding shares that were not worth the paper they were printed on, as the old-timers might say. Yet the clich quickly proved truer than anyone might have imagined: Webvan stock certificates and other mementos quickly found takers online.
7/18/2001	Metro Briefing | New Jersey: South Brunswick: Stolen Parts Sold On Ebay	A worker at the Volkswagen warehouse here told the police that he had stolen parts and then sold them on eBay, the police said yesterday. The worker, Glenn Feigenbaum, 43, was charged with theft and fencing on Monday after he sold stolen parts on the auction Web site to an undercover detective, the police said. The police were searching warehouse records yesterday to determine how much had been stolen but said that at least $20,000 in parts so far had been sold. A woman who answered the telephone yesterday at Mr. Feigenbaum's house refused to comment.
7/17/2001	Metro Business Briefing | Eight Miles Of Book Links	The Strand Book Store in Manhattan has signed a deal to sell its merchandise on eBay's online marketplace Half.com. A portion of Strand's famed eight miles of new, used and rare titles went on sale on the site about three weeks ago, but officials waited until yesterday to announce the agreement in order to work out any kinks, said Kristin Keyes, a spokeswoman for Half.com. Founded in 1927, the Strand has two retail locations -- 828 Broadway, at 12th Street, and 95 Fulton Street in the seaport district -- and a Web site, www.strandbooks.com, that also sells books. Hope Reeves (NYT)
7/15/2001	Three Seats in Coach, For Armchair Travelers	Looking for some bargain airline seats? Three coach seats from Trans World Airlines are now for sale on eBay, the online auction site. Where are they going? Anywhere the buyer may want to put them, actually.
7/5/2001	Buy, Buy. Sigh.	To the Editor: Re your article ''ABC's of EBay: Auction, Bid and Conquer'' (June 14): Egads! Make eBay more enticing for the bidders? I've already got ''Sucker for eBay'' tattooed on my psyche. Sometimes I think I should have my income checks direct-deposited to PayPal and other payment-facilitating operations. If I need a support group, it's to get me off the habit. JOAN MARY MACEY Binghamton, N.Y.
7/5/2001	Here's a Concept: Fixed Prices at EBay	THIRTY years have passed, so I am ready to admit publicly that my mother was right when she warned that I would ruin my eyes if I read in bed with a flashlight. But I still maintain that it was worth it. The contraband books I kept under the covers featured a likable teenage detective named Trixie Belden who got right to the bottom of the mystery of the old mansion and unraveled the secret of the blinking eye.
6/29/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: E-Commerce Lobby Formed	A group of e-commerce companies and trade groups including eBay, Orbitz and the Electronic Commerce Association have joined forces to create a lobbying organization in Washington. The goal of the new lobby, NetChoice, is ''defending online businesses against efforts to stifle Internet-based competition with protectionist legislation or regulation,'' its officials said. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and Representative Gerald C. Weller, Republican of Illinois, praised the goals. ''If the Internet revolution has shown us anything, it's that technological innovation and a robust marketplace are an unbeatable combination,'' Mr. Lieberman, above, said.
6/27/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Congress Seeks Information On Fraud	Members of Congress yesterday asked for guidance from some of the companies that are hosts to Internet auctions -- Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com -- in assessing the prevalence of online auction fraud. Representatives Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, left, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Heather A. Wilson, Republican of New Mexico, sent letters to the chief executives of the companies in an effort to learn more about how the fraud occurs and ways to stop it. The lawmakers cited findings from a recent study by the Internet Fraud Complaint Center that showed online auction fraud accounted for about 64 percent of all fraud complaints received by the center from May to November 2000. Company officials were asked what types of fraud occurred in online auctions, what rules existed for dealing with disguised identities and if these rules might actually aid fraudulent practices, and whether certain state laws or regulations interfered with the ability to combat online fraud.
6/18/2001	E-Commerce Report; EBay's entry into the market for assisting small companies poses challenges for rivals.	FOR companies looking to sell e-commerce services to small businesses, last week may well be remembered as a turning point. The shift began on Monday, when eBay announced it was stepping into the market by selling easy-to-build Web stores and listing them on its site for $10 a month, starting today. It was not a welcome announcement for competitors, given eBay's already strong bond with small businesses, many of which rely on the site for the bulk of their sales.
6/17/2001	POSTINGS: Guilty Verdict in Case of Missing Lighting Fixtures; Artifacts to Return To Grand Central	Fifteen original oak-leaf-and-acorn rosette lighting fixtures taken from Grand Central Terminal during its renovation four years ago and later offered for auction on eBay are soon to be released from a courthouse evidence room in Orange County, N.Y., and returned to the station -- to replace their replacements. On June 7, a jury found Joseph Tangney, 48, a worker on the renovation project, guilty on two counts of criminal possession of stolen property: 37 architectural elements from Grand Central, including the 15 fixtures, with a total value of $75,000 to $100,000.
6/14/2001	ABC's of EBay: Auction, Bid And Conquer	IT was 9 a.m. on a Sunday here. Hundreds of people had gathered, mostly middle-aged or older, though there was an occasional young couple who had brought their toddler. Speakers testified to how their lives had been changed by the community they had discovered. It is, they said, a powerful grass-roots movement that is transforming America and beyond. ''We're trying to take over the world, and we want your help,'' one said, and listeners nodded in agreement.
6/7/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Ebay And Terra In Marketing Pact	Terra Lycos of Spain will put all of the eBay Inc. auction listings on its Lycos Auctions Web site, under a multiyear marketing agreement. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Terra Lycos said the arrangement would allow Lycos users to buy and sell items on eBay, the online auction giant, directly from the Lycos Auctions site.
5/24/2001	EBay Irritates Some Sellers By Banning Links to Home Sites	EBay and its sellers may need each other to survive, but that doesn't exactly mean they are best friends. The relationship took another rocky turn recently as eBay announced that starting May 31, it would prohibit sellers from linking to their own home pages from eBay pages that list items up for bid. A seller is allowed to provide text descriptions of items, as well as photographs and graphics, but it cannot link to a separate Web site that may provide more information about that item, or any other. Now sellers who want to take customers to their own Web sites may do so only through a free eBay service called About Me. It invites sellers to set up an eBay-based Web page that includes information about themselves but not about items sold outside eBay's auctions.
5/10/2001	In Throes of Passion, A Sniper Is Born	THE green clock haunts me still. Night after night I lie awake and replay the chain of tragic events that led me to love a green Art Deco kitchen clock -- and to lose it -- when the clock went on sale on eBay a couple of weeks ago. Back then, I was an innocent, a na?ve bidder who clicked through hundreds of listings before those old electric kitchen clocks caught my eye. Made in the late 20's and early 30's, they had streamlined shapes and chrome trim as fancy and distinctive as fins on a big old sedan.
5/10/2001	Ban on Nazi Items Upsets Collectors	MIKE PETERS, an avid collector of artifacts from World War II, was once an enthusiastic user of online auctions. Every day, he logged on to Yahoo Auctions or eBay and trolled for uniforms, helmets, medals, flags, bayonets and books. Sometimes he would come across items that had belonged to Nazi soldiers, and he would snap them up, proud to fill a gap in his collection. Those sources have all but dried up for Mr. Peters. In the past year, both Yahoo Auctions and eBay have taken steps to prohibit members from selling any items, except coins and stamps, with Nazi insignia. Officials for both companies say the rules were in response to complaints that auction services were making money from Nazi memorabilia and from reproductions of Nazi artifacts.
5/3/2001	EBay Removes Auction Posting After Objections From Diallos	The auction for what was said to be a piece of the front door from the Bronx apartment building where Amadou Diallo was killed came to an end yesterday when eBay, the Internet auction company, removed the posting from its Web site. Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman, said the company decided to remove the posting after receiving a letter from a lawyer representing Kadiatou Diallo, Mr. Diallo's mother. ''This was causing the family grief,'' Mr. Pursglove said.
5/2/2001	Bronx Man Offers for eBay Auction What He Calls Piece of Diallo Door	A chunk of what is said to be the bullet-riddled door from the vestibule where Amadou Diallo was killed two years ago is being offered on eBay, the Internet auction site. The starting bid is $41,000, $1,000 for every shot fired by the four police officers. As of last night, no bids had been placed, but the South Bronx man who is selling the item said that the proceeds would go to support a march on Washington to call for more federal oversight of the police. The rest of the money, said the seller, Jared Seth November, 52, would go to the parents of Mr. Diallo to establish a museum at the Bronx house where their unarmed son died in a barrage of gunfire in a case that became a symbol to critics of the police.
4/18/2001	EBay Suspends Coin Seller Over Delivery Concerns	EBay, the Internet auction service, has suspended the account of a seller suspected of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from people who bid successfully on gold and silver coins and bullion, sent their money and got nothing in return, the company said. Last Saturday, eBay suspended the account of Anthony L. McEnroe of Peoria, Ill., whose precious metals and trading business operated on the site under the name BullionOne@auctionsmanager.com. In January, eBay suspended an account that Mr. McEnroe used for selling coins under the name nicmac042200, also after accusations of nondelivery of purchases.
3/30/2001	EBAY OPENS INTERNATIONAL SITES	The Internet auction giant eBay Inc. said it had opened Web sites in Ireland, New Zealand and Switzerland as part of its strategy to expand internationally. It now operates in a dozen countries outside the United States.
3/15/2001	Turning to eBay as a Cure for Auction Fever	MY mother-in-law used to take me to country auctions near her house in rural Pennsylvania. As she strode through a barn and sized up the piles of faded quilts, paint-chipped lawn chairs and rusty egg beaters, I would tag along, eating a hot, puffy funnel cake from the stand and generally enjoying myself. Until the bidding started. That part terrified me. I don't like to get carried away. In fact, I so feared overpaying that when my mother-in-law once got into a bidding war over three enormous terra cotta pots I had been admiring, I thought I would be sick. After a tense few seconds, she prevailed with a $15 bid. But as we lugged away the booty, which was in mint condition and probably worth 10 times that amount, I couldn't help blurting out, ''I wonder if you could have gotten the pots for $14.75.'' She doesn't take me to auctions anymore.
3/13/2001	MICROSOFT AND EBAY FORM BROAD ALLIANCE	Microsoft and eBay said yesterday that they had entered into an alliance under which eBay's auction Web site would adopt some of Microsoft's software and Microsoft would make eBay's auction listings available on some of Microsoft's sites, like MSN. EBay has been a major customer of a Microsoft competitor, Sun Microsystems. EBay's chief executive, Meg Whitman, said her company would continue to use Sun computers and software for the company's back-end computing operations. Analysts said the strategic relationship was the first of a series of deals by Microsoft as it tried to start its Internet initiative, .Net. John Markoff
3/9/2001	3 Men Are Charged With Fraud In 1,100 Art Auctions on EBay	Three men accused of trying to sell an abstract painting for $135,805 on the eBay auction Web site last year were indicted yesterday on charges of taking part in a bidding ring that cost hundreds of art buyers a total of $450,000. The 35-page indictment charges the men with 16 counts of wire fraud and mail fraud. It accuses them of placing ''shill'' bids in 1,100 auctions between October 1998 and May 2000, including an auction involving the abstract painting, which seemed to be the work of the artist Richard Diebenkorn.
2/21/2001	EBay Is Said To Be Close To Acquiring A French Site	EBay is close to acquiring the French online auctioneer the iBazar Group, people close to the negotiations said today. The acquisition, valued at just under $100 million, would enhance eBay's leadership in the online auction market, while undermining its biggest European rival, QXL Ricardo. The deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday.
2/18/2001	NO-SALE FOR SAND	Though Atlantic City's is among the last free beaches on the shore (tags not required), its sand is not for the taking, according to the beach patrol, which blocked an attempt by Harry Mehlman of Brigantine to sell a pound of Atlantic City beach sand for 99 cents (plus $4 shipping and handling) through the Ebay Web site to a sand collector in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Mehlman canceled the sale after eBay officials questioned the sale's legality and contacted the patrol. ''I take more than a pound of sand off the beaches in a month in the summer in my shoes and kayak,'' he said. Bill Kent
2/11/2001	Put Your Money Where Their Mouths Are	When it comes to celebrity love, the general public is apparently going, going, gone. In celebration of Valentine's Day, star-worshipers can bid on framed, autographed lipstick kisses from an impressive list of Hollywood's glamorazzi in a weekly auction series sponsored by the beauty company Sephora. This month, fans can vie to purchase on-paper smooches from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Calista Flockhart, Jennifer Aniston, Charlize Theron and Naomi Judd. (Bidders can go to Sephora.com for a direct link to the auction site, which is at eBay.) Proceeds will benefit Operation Smile, a nonprofit organization that provides heath care for poor children.
1/22/2001	EBay Greatly Expands Live Online Auction Bidding	EBay, the largest online auction company, will announce an agreement today that allows users to participate in live bidding at 300 auction houses worldwide. The company announced a limited live auction service last year through its eBay Premier site. That service was for buying works of fine art, wine and other luxury goods through a small number of auction houses, like eBay-owned Butterfields. Today's agreement, with the London-based company icollector, founded in 1994, will greatly expand the available live auctions and will expose eBay's 22.5 million registered users to those sites.
1/20/2001	EBay's Liability Is Cleared in Suit	EBay, the online auction service, has won dismissal of a class-action lawsuit that asserted that the company had a responsibility to ensure the authenticity of the items sold through its Web site. Judge Linda B. Quinn of Superior Court in San Diego County in California dismissed a case against eBay on Thursday in which buyers sued over auctions for autographed sports memorabilia later found to be fake. EBay had argued that though it did what it could to curb fraud in its auctions and referred cases to the police, it could not be held responsible for bad deals.
1/19/2001	EBay's 4th-Quarter Earnings Exceed Analysts' Predictions	EBay, the online auction giant, continued its run as one of the Internet's few remaining success stories with an announcement yesterday that its revenue for the fourth quarter was $134 million, slightly ahead of analysts' expectations. ''We think that it's fair to say that our brand has begun to transcend the Internet,'' said Meg Whitman, the company's president and chief executive. The site, Ms. Whitman said, has become ''the best place to come and shop for practically any item on earth.''
1/11/2001	When It Came to Privacy On EBay, No Became Yes	EBay outraged many of its members this week when it reset their e-mail and telemarketing preferences, automatically flipping them from No to Yes. For at least 6 million of eBay's 19 million members, that means that unless they change their notification settings, they may soon be receiving e-mail promotions, telemarketing calls and advertisements in their postal mailboxes. The switch was eBay's attempt to cope with a glitch in its registration system that was making No the default option on members' preferences pages, according to Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman. EBay had intended for every preference to be labeled Yes unless changed by the member. The glitch, Mr. Pursglove said, meant that even people who might have wanted to receive administrative e-mail messages, like notices about changes to the privacy policy, would not have received those messages.
1/9/2001	EBAY TO BUY KOREA'S INTERNET AUCTION	EBay Inc. said it would pay about $120 million in cash to buy control of the Internet Auction Company, South Korea's largest online auction company, as it expands across the globe. EBay, the No. 1 Web auction company, said the purchase would give it 2.8 million users in Asia's second-largest online market. The acquisition will probably trim 2 cents a share from eBay's 2001 profit because of interest income it will lose on money used in the purchase. EBay operates in seven nations outside the United States and is expanding in nations with larger Internet populations as part of plans to increase sales 50 percent a year in the next five years. EBay said it did not plan to change Internet Auction's management and might use the 140-employee company to enter smaller markets in Asia.
1/5/2001	EBAY KNOCKED OUT FOR 11 HOURS	EBay, the Internet's most popular auction service, suffered a severe technical problem that brought down its service for nearly 11 hours yesterday. The crash stemmed not from a single problem but from a series of hardware failures compounded by a database malfunction, the company said. A series of technical problems plagued the eBay system last fall, causing numerous shutdowns. A spokesman for eBay, based in San Jose, Calif., said the company had been aware for some time that its system was at risk, but rather than interrupt service to fix it during the busy holiday season it chose to use a variety of work-around solutions. EBay said it would automatically extend all affected listings by 24 hours. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
12/14/2000	Upside of Poor Spelling	To the Editor: Michelle Slatalla's article ''EBay, a Site for the Lost and Found'' (Online Shopper, Dec. 7) points out some of the problems users can run into when searching for an item on the site. When items are mislisted (e.g., the Apple ''eye book''), they become tough to find. The flip side of a mislisting is that because fewer people find these items, their selling prices are generally considerably lower than properly listed items.
12/11/2000	Reluctantly Cooperating In the Redefining of Fun	When Icebox.com sold a pilot script to Fox Broadcasting last month based on the hit animated Web show ''Zombie College,'' it was big news for Icebox, an Internet start-up. And in the news release Icebox promptly sent out, the news was even bigger. ''Icebox sells animated series to Fox,'' it read. The resulting article in The Los Angeles Times infuriated executives at Fox, a unit of the News Corporation. ''To put it in perspective,'' a Fox spokesman said, ''this is one of 100 scripts we're considering.'' After a cooling-off period, the parties are talking again, so ''Zombie College,'' where students eat each other's brains, may yet make it. But the incident illustrates at least three lessons about Web entertainment, whose brief history is littered with creative efforts that won cult followings but failed to draw mass audiences. The first lesson is that virtually no one has found a way to make money on entertainment properties for which the Web is the sole form of distribution. Icebox, whose efforts typically take the form of three-minute animations, produces many of the most popular ''series'' on the Web. But like many other Web entertainers, the Los Angeles-based company is in financial trouble. It recently laid off half its staff and badly needs a television deal to pay the bills.
12/7/2000	EBay, a Site for the Lost and Found	PLEASE do not buy me a used hockey jersey that Wayne Gretzky may or may not have worn when the Rangers played away. I hate to break it to eBay, which last week identified the jersey as a Classic Gift for the holidays, but that is not my idea of a good present. But if the jersey's minimum acceptable bid ($3,500) was the amount you were planning to spend to buy my love, there are plenty of other items on the site's new Priceless Gifts section that you might want to consider.
11/30/2000	Backup's Value Rises On Field, and Online	How shall we measure the true value of a modern National Football League quarterback? By his powerful Favrian arm?
11/30/2000	Mainstream Sites Serve as Portals to Hate	EARLIER this month, in a cramped airport lounge in San Jose, Calif., two seemingly unrelated parties sat down to talk about hate. On one side of a conference table sat researchers from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization in Los Angeles dedicated to the marginalization of groups like the Ku Klux Klan. On the other sat representatives of Yahoo, arguably the most popular site on the Web and, at that moment, home to dozens of online clubs with names like White Knights of the K.K.K.
11/13/2000	EBay Not Liable for Goods That Are Illegal, Judge Says	In a decision that could set the stage for how courts respond to accusations of fraud in online auctions, a state judge in San Francisco ruled last week that eBay could not be held liable for bootlegged music sold using its Web site. The ruling, by Judge Stuart R. Pollak, cites a section of a 1996 federal law, the Communications Decency Act, which says that interactive computer services are not liable for material published on their networks. Until now, the law has been primarily applied to Internet service providers like America Online.
11/7/2000	HACKING SUSPECT CASE ADVANCES	A Montreal judge yesterday scheduled a December court hearing for a 16-year-old boy accused of sabotaging prominent Web sites like Yahoo, Amazon, eBay and Dell. The suspect, who cannot be publicly identified because of his age, is accused of hijacking computers at leading universities in the United States and then using them to attack popular Web sites. Robert Frank (NYT)
10/21/2000	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the earnings of eBay, the Internet auctioneer, referred imprecisely to its revenues for the period ended Sept. 30. The figure of $102.8 million was for online operations; consolidated net revenues were $113.4 million.
10/20/2000	Ebay's Net Income in Quarter Topped Wall St. Expectations	The Internet auction giant eBay reported quarterly earnings yesterday that beat Wall Street's expectations and offered a sharp contrast to the recent high-technology gloom. The company reported $15.2 million in earnings for the quarter, or 5 cents a share, on revenue of $102.8 million from gross merchandise sales of $1.4 billion. The earnings were sharply higher than the $1.2 million, or 1 cent a share, for the quarter a year earlier.
10/18/2000	Corrections	An article in Business Day on Monday and a related article yesterday about a lawsuit against eBay referred imprecisely to a preliminary ruling in the case. In that ruling, which was made last Wednesday, the judge granted eBay's request to dismiss the complaints in their current form. But she let the plaintiffs refile the case with more specific arguments, accusing eBay of neglecting to protect consumers from sales of forged sports memorabilia in its online auctions. The judge did not support eBay's motion to dismiss the case itself. On Monday, the plaintiffs responded by refiling.
10/17/2000	EBay Users Refile Lawsuit On Sale of Fake Memorabilia	Seven users of eBay refiled a lawsuit against it yesterday, accusing eBay of neglecting to protect consumers from sales of forged sports memorabilia in its online auctions. The lawsuit was resubmitted in response to a ruling last Wednesday by a judge in San Diego, who dismissed the complaints against eBay but allowed the plaintiffs to refile them using more specific arguments.
10/6/2000	Lost Grand Central Lamps Turn Up on an eBay Listing	And the winning bid for 15 original light fixtures from Grand Central Terminal offered on eBay? A search warrant. Three years ago, amid the tumult and upheaval of renovation, numerous ceiling fixtures -- handsome brass rosettes of oak leaves and acorns -- disappeared from the lower concourse of the terminal. Replicas had to be fashioned, at a total cost of $15,000.
9/21/2000	EBAY FORECASTS STRONG GROWTH	Aggressively projecting continued strong growth, eBay has set a revenue goal of $3 billion in 2005, the online auction company said yesterday. EBay executives told analysts the goal would imply revenue growth ''approaching 50 percent a year.'' It based the goal on its estimate of the size of its various markets, including collectibles, practical items, computers and used autos and parts. EBay estimated the size of its potential markets at about $1.6 trillion, increasing to about $2 trillion by 2005.
8/20/2000	If a Transaction Goes Sour, Where Do You Turn?	THE diamond advertised by ''mrwatch'' on eBay was precisely what Robert and Teri La Plant wanted. A 1.41 carat marquise-cut diamond that was of good quality and could be used to upgrade her old engagement ring for their 10th wedding anniversary last September. They were told by mrwatch, a seller of estate jewelry, that the diamond had not been artificially enhanced and, though it had a small flaw, it was described as not visible to the naked eye.
8/20/2000	The Powers Behind the Auctions	WHEN people think of online auctions, they probably envision retirees selling bean bags from their basements and collectors trading baseball cards or limited-edition lunch boxes. After all, the founder of eBay, Pierre M. Omidyar, and its chief executive, Meg Whitman, are considered ingenious precisely because they created the first efficient global marketplace where consumers could sell directly to one another. But occasional sellers are hardly what have made eBay, with more than $87.9 million in online revenue in the second quarter, one of the most successful Internet businesses to date. Log on to eBay and you can easily find brand-new air-conditioners, boxes of unused printer cartridges and cases of 7-inch zippers, all nylon, all black. Rather than just items destined for garage sales, plenty of new merchandise is available. ''This is not just mom and pop cleaning out their attics,'' said Evie Black Dykema, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. ''There is this whole subeconomy of small businesses who use eBay.''
8/15/2000	STATIC LINGERS ON EBAY	EBay, the largest Internet auction company, said the intermittent technical problems that have hampered its Web site for the last two weeks might continue for another 10 days. The company posted an apology for the problems on the site, explaining that they stemmed from a system upgrade that eBay began Aug. 2. The problems caused some features to be inaccessible and others to function slowly. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
8/3/2000	A New Caveat for eBay Users: Seller Beware; Putting Your Family Heirlooms Up for Bids May Make You a Target for Credit Card Fraud	CONNIE BACON, a regular seller on eBay, thought that she had brokered an excellent deal. On behalf of a consignment shop in Charleston, S.C., she had sold a Rolex watch for $13,500 in an online auction, and everything had gone smoothly. A man who identified himself as Kelvin Johanis had put the money in an escrow account, assuring Ms. Bacon that the payment was good, and the shopkeeper had shipped the package to a house specified by the buyer in Lynwood, Wash.
7/30/2000	An eSpree of Art Buying Makes a Believer	ANDRE BRETON, who was almost as famous for his French arrogance as for founding Surrealism, enjoyed playing the role of the anti-snob. He once said that the most interesting artistic experience in Paris was going to the flea market. I thought of Breton the other night while sifting through the riotous jumble of merchandise offered at eBay, the online auction site. It lists some 3.7 million items organized into 2,900 categories, one of which is fine art. To try it out, I typed in the name of Vincent van Gogh. The search yielded 617 items ranging from a supposed original painting (price: $1 million) to a mass-produced souvenir of artistic torment: a curvy, pinkish rubber objet described with typical eBay poetry as ''Van Gogh's Ear -- squish it, squeeze it!''
7/28/2000	EBAY PREVAILS IN E-MAIL DISPUTE	The online auction company eBay said yesterday that ReverseAuction.com, a competing online auction service, had agreed to settle a lawsuit by paying eBay $1.2 million and by refraining from using software to capture e-mail addresses from eBay users. EBay sued the company in January, contending that ReverseAuction had illegally obtained information about eBay's subscribers and was sending them mass quantities of unsolicited e-mail messages, known as spam, urging them to try ReverseAuction.com instead. ReverseAuction has denied that its messages amounted to spam. Lisa Guernsey (NYT)
7/1/2000	Seaver on the Trading Block	Not every fan who received a Tom Seaver bobble head doll at Shea Stadium last Sunday apparently cherished the seven-and-a-half-inch-tall ceramic likeness of the Hall of Fame pitcher for long -- or even opened the box.
6/14/2000	EBAY TO ACQUIRE HALF.COM, A TRADING SITE FOR USED ITEMS	EBay Inc., the largest Internet auction site, agreed yesterday to buy the closely held Half.com for at least $312.8 million in stock, expanding into fixed-price trades between Web users. EBay said it would swap 4.6 million to 5.5 million shares for Half.com stock. Half.com's buyers and sellers trade used books, CD's, movies and video games at prices that are at least half off the list price. EBay, based in San Jose, Calif., rose $1.1875 yesterday, to $68. It made its announcement after the close of regular United States trading.
6/4/2000	High-Tech Philanthropy in a Low-Tech Guatemalan Village	IT is early evening on a hazy spring night, and a group of children are gathered on the shores of Lake Atitlan, eagerly awaiting the visit from Karin Stahl. Her boat has just pulled in to this tiny Mayan village 90 miles west of Guatemala City, and it is as if a celebrity has arrived. ''Karina!'' they cry, rushing toward the docks. ''Bienvenidos, Karina!''
6/2/2000	THE BIDDING GAME: A special report; In Online Auction World, Hoaxes Aren't Easy to See	When eBay, the Internet auction company, suspended the seller and voided the sale of a vivid abstract painting whose price shot from 25 cents to $135,805 last month, his offense had nothing to do with the authenticity of the painting or the story he invented to go with the work. Rather, the seller, Kenneth A. Walton, had entered a bid of $4,500 on his own offering -- a practice known as shill bidding -- on the second day of a 10-day auction, long before speculation that the painting might be by the renowned artist Richard Diebenkorn sent the price soaring.
5/28/2000	Rejection of the Worst Kind: Ebay Dumps Bond Traders	Visitors to online auction sites know that people try to sell the darnedest things. But a team of emerging-markets bond specialists based in North Korea? Thomas Cooper, who manages an emerging-markets bond fund at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company in Boston, says he got the point right away when he saw the posting on eBay last week: People who sell, trade and analyze debt issued in emerging markets are going begging as some firms exit that business. Still, he could not resist the temptation and placed a bid of $10 million.
5/26/2000	Judge Bans Web Site's Use of EBay Data	A federal judge has granted a request by the auction giant eBay to stop another Web site, at least temporarily, from compiling a database of eBay's auction information without its consent. The decision was issued Wednesday by Judge Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District Court in San Jose, Calif. It bans Bidder's Edge Inc., the operator of an auction listings site, from ''accessing eBay's computer systems by use of any automated querying system without eBay's written authorization.''
5/26/2000	Spitzer Sues Gallery Over Fake Art on EBay	Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York filed suit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday against an Orange County gallery, accusing it of selling fake artworks over the Internet on the eBay auction site. The suit contends that the Antique and Design Center of New Windsor, N.Y., sold numerous paintings in 1999 with forged signatures of well-known artists including Oscar Bluemner, Charles Burchfield and George Luks. In particular, the suit alleges that the gallery, using the Internet name ''sambuca914,'' sold 23 fake paintings at prices from $700 to more than $10,000. The suit was brought on behalf of 23 purchasers all over the country who paid a total of $75,000, but Mr. Spitzer said at a news conference that he believed that many other people had purchased virtually worthless art from the gallery through eBay.
5/15/2000	From Tres Chic to Internet Geek; A Purveyor of Prestige Bets His Own Money on the Web	Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, wants to get something straight. ''I don't see myself at all as a fashion guy,'' he said in fluent, if heavily accented English, in a conference room adjacent to his office at LVMH's headquarters here.
5/11/2000	Latest Items On eBay: Seized Loot	WHAT was once the loot of local criminals is now a hot seller on eBay. Oregon is auctioning seized and recovered property online as an alternative to selling the goods at a local auction or store. The effort has been so successful that at least two other states are thinking of following suit.
5/11/2000	EBay Cancels Art Sale and Suspends Seller	EBay, the online auction house, canceled the sale of an abstract painting to a Dutch software executive for $135,805 yesterday, contending that the seller, Kenneth A. Walton, who listed the item under the name ''golfpoorly,'' had violated its rules in a way that artificially inflated the sale price. The company also suspended three accounts that Mr. Walton used to trade art, accusing him of ''shill bidding,'' meaning that he entered bids on his own sales. In a telephone interview, Mr. Walton, a Sacramento lawyer, acknowledged placing bids on his own objects, but said he had done so for friends and had not realized that he had violated eBay's rules.
5/10/2000	Online Seller of Abstract Work Adds a Money-Back Guarantee	The man who put a painting up for auction on the Internet for 25 cents and ended up making a $135,805 deal acknowledged yesterday that he concocted part of the story he used to describe the work and said he would be willing to let the buyer out of the sale. Before the bidding closed on Monday, speculation that the vivid abstract work -- which bore the initials ''R.D.'' -- was by the California artist Richard Diebenkorn set off a frenzy, though the description never said who had painted the work.
5/10/2000	What is a dot-com brand name worth? A new survey has some not-too-surprising answers.	MUCH has been made of the need for dot-coms to generate awareness of their names among computer users. Internet companies are spending billions of dollars online, in print and on television to establish their brands. Now comes a study that tries to identify the winners and losers in the big branding struggle. The study, which was conducted in October and released in mid-April by Greenfield Online, an Internet market research company based in Wilton, Conn., surveyed about 3,400 computer users. Among 100 Internet names placed before the respondents, Microsoft.com has the highest ''brand power,'' defined as a combination of rankings in three categories: brand familiarity, the brand's ability to affect the Internet landscape and the brand's perceived financial strength.
5/9/2000	Online Bid Soars to $135,805, Provenance Not Guaranteed	On April 28, a California man who uses the Internet name ''golfpoorly'' put a half-dozen items up for sale on eBay, the online auction company. Along with an unopened roll of twine, a never-inflated basketball, a Mexican voodoo mask, a Netgear network card and a pewter frame, he offered a ''great big wild abstract art painting'' that he said was bought years ago at a garage sale in Berkeley and had a small hole inflicted by a son wielding a plastic tricycle. The opening bid for each of the items was a quarter.
4/24/2000	Public Service's Profile Is Rising in Many College Curriculums	Pierre Omidyar did not do any volunteer work while an undergraduate here at Tufts University. Technically speaking, he does not do any now. A 32-year-old multibillionaire, he has never held a public-sector job, run for elective office, protested for social change. So what, exactly, was Mr. Omidyar doing here today, teaching one of the inaugural classes at Tufts's new University College of Citizenship and Public Service? Well, for starters, Mr. Omidyar, a 1988 Tufts graduate and the founder of the wildly successful online trading post eBay, paid for the thing, with a $10 million start-up grant to finance scholarships, faculty development and a venture fund for community projects over the next five years. And besides, the whole idea is to transform public service from a few hours of tutoring poor children or working in a homeless shelter to a lifelong commitment to civic engagement -- whether graduates go on to toil in a nonprofit organization or an investment bank.
4/20/2000	Canada Arrests 15-Year-Old In Web Attack	Canadian law enforcement officials said yesterday that they had arrested a Montreal high school student in one of the computer attacks that crippled some of the Internet's biggest sites in February, exposing deep vulnerabilities in the fledgling world of electronic commerce. The 15-year-old suspect, whom the authorities identified only by the online nickname Mafiaboy, was accused of conducting an attack against Cable News Network's Web site. He is the first to face charges in the onslaught that hindered access to the World Wide Web sites of Yahoo, eBay and E*Trade, among others, and forced hundreds of other big-name sites to shore up their defenses against an invisible and far-flung threat.
4/17/2000	Patents; An accidental harp, via eBay, sets off a successful search for the origins of 19th-century artisanship.	IN the 1890's, a man named George Durkee lived in Chicago and worked as a shop foreman at Lyon & Healy Harps Inc. Not much is known about him -- at one point, a fire destroyed company records -- except that he supervised workers who assembled harps. Some elegant concert harps were built from Mr. Durkee's own designs, and he won several patents just as the 19th century came to a close. Over the next few decades, and especially after the fire, his name disappeared from company documents and his contribution to harp design was forgotten. Until this year. Marijo Clogston made a mistake while browsing on eBay, the Internet auction site, and found herself the shocked owner of a $15,000 antique Lyon & Healy harp. It was a beautiful harp, to be sure, one of the few covered in 24-karat gold leaf. But Mrs. Clogston, a 78-year-old widow with a passion for folk harps, had not planned to buy it.
4/9/2000	Blackboard: Registration; Classes On the Block	Most people surf digital auction blocks for old LP's, cheap air-conditioners, original Beanie Babies. Now they can bid on learning. Georgetown University started auctioning classes on eBay last fall. ''It was an experiment to gauge public interest and to get a sense of how much they would pay for classes,'' said Christopher J. McDonald, the director of Georgetown's Networked Media Center, which auctioned spots in six computer classes for 10 to 15 percent less than the usual $300. ''It was free marketing,'' Mr. McDonald added. ''We couldn't hope to put a banner out there that would grab the eyeballs that this would and did.''
4/1/2000	2 Auction Sites on Web Accede To Federal Product Safeguards	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said today that two of the biggest Internet auction sites had agreed to new safeguards to protect people from buying dangerous second-hand products via the Web. The agency said the auction sites, eBay of San Jose, Calif., and Amazon.com Auctions of Seattle, had agreed to links with the commission's site to warn buyers and sellers about products that had been deemed hazardous, or in some instances even outlawed.
3/16/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Is the Online Auction King Ebay Going Once? Twice? Not Likely	So has eBay put itself up for the ultimate auction? Probably not, financiers close to eBay said yesterday, the morning after CNBC carried a report that the company was in talks that could lead to an acquisition of the auction site by Yahoo, the big Web portal.
3/9/2000	Barterer Beware	To the Editor: In regard to your article on swaps on the Web (''EBay Minus the Cash: Trading Haves for Wants,'' March 2), I have found that the ratings given to people on a site can be misleading. All a person needs to do if he or she gets bad ratings on an Internet auction or swap site is to sign on as a different member and continue to cheat other members. It cost me $493 to find that out.
3/3/2000	Charges Expected in Attack on a Web Site	The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized a computer two weeks ago from a 17-year-old New Hampshire resident who the Los Angeles Police Department said tonight would be charged in connection with attacks on the Web site of an antidrug organization. But a federal law enforcement official who asked not to be identified said tonight that the teenage hacker, who goes by the nickname Coolio, was not a suspect in last month's attacks on Yahoo, eBay and other major e-commerce Web sites.
2/20/2000	Ma's Teeth Travel In Cyberspace	HERE I am chatting with my mother long distance to Florida, no big news, just catching up, when she hits me with it: ''Hey, want to hear a hot one? I sold my teeth on eBay. I got $16.''
2/13/2000	Secure or Not, the Internet Has Become a Part of Life's Routine	When Jon Tara first heard that unknown vandals with unclear motives had managed to sabotage several of the Internet's most prominent businesses last week, the San Diego software engineer posted a probing message to an online investing forum that he frequents. ''Is this the end of Internet innocence? Is the house of cards about to crumble?'' Mr. Tara, 45, wondered. ''Can we move to an Internet-based economy while the potential exists for a group of hackers to bring it to its knees at any time?''
2/10/2000	Companies Won't Say if They Were Insured for Net Attacks	Yahoo, eBay and other companies whose Web sites came under attack this week would not say yesterday whether they carried insurance to cover their losses. The few insurers that specialize in e-commerce often request that clients not discuss specifics of the policies, which were developed over the last couple of years, for fear of inviting attacks. The policies protect against damages to systems and data and to losses suffered by customers of the Internet companies.
2/9/2000	Several Web Sites Attacked Following Assault on Yahoo	SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8 -- Hackers mounted what appeared to be coordinated attacks on the world's largest electronic commerce sites today. The attacks, which opened a window on the widespread vulnerability of the Internet, began Monday with a three-hour assault on Yahoo.com, one of the world's most popular Web sites, and continued today, temporarily crippling at least four other major sites, including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com. By tonight it had spread to a leading media site, CNN.com.
1/20/2000	The EBay Habit	To the Editor: Just read ''EBay Addict's Diary: Buy High, Sell Low,'' Jan. 13. It made me laugh -- gee, do you think there could be an anonymous group of us? My son dreamed the other night of a television show about people who had made millions on eBay. He said I was asked to be on the show -- not because I was one of the millionaires, but because most of the other people on the show had become millionaires because they had bought priceless treasures from me on eBay and then sold them for hugh profits.
1/20/2000	The EBay Habit	To the Editor: I've had to stop bidding/winning on eBay. How many antique coffee cups, Elvira collectibles, rosaries, photos of Sharon Tate, etc., does one need? I think it's the actual bidding (gambling?) that entices. I gave up when the last batch of coffee cups was delivered in pieces. MIKE HALEY Avenel, N.J.
1/13/2000	EBay Addict's Diary: Buy High, Sell Low	I AM an eBay addict. I write that now with barely a twinge. For a long time, I deluded myself into thinking I only bought essential items, like the 37 pieces of green glassware that I needed to fill the alarmingly large and empty shelves of the (third) desk on the first floor. Or the Cultural Revolution poster that almost hides the crack on the den wall. Or the vintage flour sifter, which my husband claims also sifts a little rust into cake batter. ''That's cinnamon,'' I said (addiction symptom: lying).
12/29/1999	Corrections	An article on Saturday about the high technology industry's pursuit of its interests in Washington misstated the connection of Meg Whitman to the eBay auction site. She is its president and chief executive; its founder was Pierre Omidyar.
11/25/1999	EBay Is Told That It Sells Nazi Items	The online auction service eBay Inc. has come under fire previously for letting people bid on pornography and firearms. Yesterday, it encountered more problems when a group that monitors anti-Semitism complained about the sale of Nazi memorabilia. A letter sent to the company by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said items that ''glorify Nazism'' were being auctioned and noted that the sale of such items was illegal in Germany.
11/21/1999	Bidding for the Auctioneer Is Right Up Their Alley	Haven't seen enough of Meg Whitman, the high-profile chief executive of on-line auctioneer eBay? If profiles in Business Week, Glamour and Vanity Fair left you begging for more, maybe you should consider bowling. Earlier this month, Butterfield & Butterfield, the old-time San Francisco auction house that was recently acquired by eBay, auctioned off a bowling date with Ms. Whitman and two eBay employees. Twenty-nine bids were submitted over 10 days to raise money for the San Francisco chapter of the American Red Cross. The first bid was a mere $75, but, like everything related to the Internet, the price soared, to $11,600. The lucky bidder? A group from Yahoo's auc
10/22/1999	INSIDE ART	A Botticelli With a Hitch When Timothy Potts became director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth a year ago, he began doing what museum directors typically do: searching the world for great works of art to acquire.
10/22/1999	S.E.C. Settles On-Line Stock Auction Case	The Securities and Exchange Commission said this week that it had settled charges against three men who tried to sell stock at the Internet auction site Ebay. The S.E.C., saying this was the first time it had filed charges based on a sale of securities in an on-line auction, issued cease-and-desist orders against the three.
10/8/1999	Ebay in Dispute With Listing Site	In a developing dispute over Internet auction listings, the Web site Auctionwatch.com said this week that it would continue to provide lists of items for sale on the site of Ebay Inc., which has been trying to stop the practice. Auctionwatch.com is one of a handful of Web sites calling themselves auction aggregators, which allow visitors to search for items on many auction sites from a single search page. The site submits a visitor's query to the auction search functions of sites like Amazon.com, Yahoo and MSN, then compiles the results.
10/7/1999	Items Found on the Internet Dress Up a Museum's Exhibition	AS if New York museums needed more publicity, the Whitney Museum recently revealed that it had been involved in a fierce bidding war for a 25-year-old copy of Playgirl magazine. This auction didn't take place at Christie's. It took place on the Internet. A guest museum curator, Maurice Berger, needed everyday objects -- campaign buttons, album covers and vintage magazines -- to include in the show ''American Century: Art and Culture, 1900-2000.'' Instead of spending years traveling, sifting through flea markets and other museums' collections, Mr. Berger assembled the objects in less than six months by making bids on Ebay and other auction sites.
9/22/1999	Night of the Living Bid: Four Tales From an Hour of Ebay	IT was just after 7:30 on a Monday evening in August, and Eric Clayberg, a 35-year-old software entrepreneur, was fixated on his computer screen. An auction on Ebay was minutes from closing, and Mr. Clayberg wanted to be the final bidder. Over the last month and a half, he had perfected his strategy, a nimble mix of patience, quick clicking and good timing. Every few seconds, Mr. Clayberg clicked the reload button on his Web browser to obtain up-to-the-second information about the item he wanted: a coin-operated arcade game called Taito Elevator Action. The price seemed to be stuck at $450, the result of a bid four hours before.
9/22/1999	3 Brothers, 4 Months, 1 Fortune In an Early Success in Germany	SITTING at a makeshift confer ence table a white table top supported by cardboard boxes -- in the Spartan Berlin headquarters of Ebay Germany, the 26-year-old chief executive, Oliver Samwer, can barely contain his excitement as he outlines his company's spectacular and, in Germany right now, singular success story. It doesn't take long: Last September, he and his 24-year-old brother, Alexander, finished their respective university degrees and packed their bags to join their brother, Marc, 28, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay, the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a similar site in Germany.
9/22/1999	Even Beyond the Big Guys, A Wealth of Auction Choices	EBAY, Amazon.com and Yahoo are the 800-pound gorilla and two 400-pound siblings in the auction business, but there are hundreds of similar sites. But despite a ''build it and they will come'' business plan, most of the sites have fewer than 200 items for sale at any one time; many have fewer than 25. A lot of sites are conducting promotional campaigns, including reducing fees, to attract a critical mass of users. Yet, in contrast to Ebay, many of the smaller person-to-person auctions out there remain a buyer's market -- if buyers are willing to scour skimpy listings for bargains.
9/17/1999	Big Internet Sites Joining Auction Network	Nearly 100 Internet sites, including three of the biggest -- Microsoft's MSN, Excite@Home and Lycos -- have agreed to share their auction listings so that an item put up for sale on one site will be available for bidding on all other sites. The move, which is to be announced today, is an effort to catch up with the huge popularity of Ebay, the dominant on-line auction site, which has more than three million items for sale at any one time, ranging from stuffed bears to minivans.
9/16/1999	An Ebay Report Card	To the Editor: I have been an on-line seller and buyer for about a year, and most of my sales listings are on Ebay. I have had great successes but would like to mention some negative experiences.
9/16/1999	An Ebay Report Card	To the Editor: My story is quite different from those described in ''Betting the Farm on the Virtual Store'' (Sept. 9). Beginning two years ago, in my sophomore year in high school, I started my own business selling celebrity autographs on Ebay. The business was so lucrative that I lost sight of what I should have been doing my sophomore year: hitting the books and concentrating on my studies.
9/16/1999	An Ebay Report Card	To the Editor: In your article on on-line auctions, you quote Arlen Miller as drawing an ethical line and only getting in touch with Ebay buyers after an auction is over.
9/15/1999	Alcohol and Tobacco Sales Are Being Blocked by Ebay	The on-line auction site Ebay confirmed yesterday that it planned to prohibit the sale of alcohol and tobacco products on its service, asserting that the sales could subject some users to prosecution under a growing number of state regulations governing the sale of such products across state lines. Largely for the same reasons, the company decided in February 1999 to prohibit the sale of firearms on the site. The prohibition on sales of tobacco and alcohol, reported on Monday by Cnet.com, will begin on Oct. 13, company officials said yesterday.
9/9/1999	Betting the Farm On the Virtual Store	FOR eight years, Fred Parks says, he sold all manner of antiques and collectibles, ''everything but tube socks and T-shirts,'' from a series of stores in downtown Baltimore. About a year ago, he closed his latest store, but he didn't go out of business. He took his expertise in ceramics -- Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Arts and Crafts styles -- to Ebay, the largest of the on-line auction sites. Now working from home and a studio that he rents for $100 a month, he has lowered his expenses, he says, and increased his prices and profits. ''If I opened a store, I might have 35 people on a good day,'' he said. ''I get thousands in my virtual store.''
9/3/1999	Auction for a Kidney Pops Up on Ebay's Site	Bidding for a human kidney, described on the Internet auction site Ebay as ''fully functional,'' began at $25,000 and reached $5,750,100 before the company abruptly ended the auction yesterday afternoon. In the pantheon of bizarre items that Internet users offer for sale on Ebay -- host to about 2.6 million auctions a day -- human organs are forbidden. To buy or sell them is a felony under Federal law, and trading in illegal goods is a violation of Ebay's rules.
9/1/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Cutting Through Fog of Growth for Net Retailers	Financial reports from Internet retailers are like the pronouncements of the Delphic Priestess: future focused and infamously inscrutable. Traditional retailers, Sears and Wal-Mart among them, report changes in sales for stores open at least one year, providing analysts a way to evaluate whether growth is real or merely a construct of new stores. On-line merchants offer no such equivalent.
8/19/1999	Ebay Addicts Come Up for Air	Now Ebay users can bid and run. In an effort to differentiate itself from competitors, the auction giant has started a paging service that will update users on the progress of their auctions when they are away from their computers. ''A lot of Ebay users were telling us they go out and get busy,'' said Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for the company, countering the popular image of his customers. ''They've lost track of time. When they get home, the auction has ended and they've been outbid. If there is some way that we could have notified them, they would have skipped the second course or cut their cup of coffee.''
7/27/1999	PUBLIC LIVES	Housecleaning And History Cross CAROLE HALL says the timing was a coincidence -- her husband, LLOYD, was rushing to list their John F. Kennedy Jr. figurine on the Ebay on-line auction service before ''Jeopardy!'' came on at 7:30 P.M. on July 16. ''We had no idea that 40 minutes later he was going to take off,'' said Mrs. Hall, who lives in Pawtucket, R.I. Nor did she have any idea that the figurine, which she bought for $1 at a yard sale several years ago, would go for $227.50. ''I thought maybe I'd make $5,'' Mrs. Hall said, explaining that her only motive in selling the statuette was to clear some shelf space. ''We have too much in my house,'' she said. ''It looks like a gift shop.'' The first thing her husband did when he got up on the morning the Kennedy plane was reported missing was to log on to Ebay. ''He said, 'John John's figurine is up to $90,' '' Mrs. Hall recalled. ''I said, 'It's more collectible than I thought.' But they have this little news thing that comes on the screen. He says, 'John John's plane is missing.' If I had known, I wouldn't have put it on. I wouldn't take advantage of a disaster like that.'' Ebay was flooded with Kennedy memorabilia last week, including dozens of copies of George magazine that were offered for $10 to $20. Not everything was selling, though. As of 5:30 P.M. yesterday, no one had bid on a pair of used airplane tickets. The seller wanted $4,850. ''These two airline tickets were given to me personally and before leaving the plane by John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette,'' the seller wrote. ''They were sitting next to me the entire trip from Miami to New York, a trip that I will remember forever.'' Nor had any would-be buyers met another seller's $10,000 opening bid for figurines of Mr. Kennedy and his sister, Caroline. The buyer of the Halls' figurine turned out to be LENNY VEGA, a hairdresser in Manhattan. ''He's very special,'' Mr. Vega said of Mr. Kennedy. ''I grew up watching him on television, but I never had the chance to see him.'' Another Sale Of the Century ''This is the last great amazing celebrity sale,'' NANCY VALENTINO declared yesterday. Ms. Valentino is a vice president at Christie's and the resident expert on Marilyn Monroe, whose belongings -- her stilleto-heeled shoes, her earrings, her Golden Globe Award, her piano, her inexplicably lopsided chandelier -- will be sold at auction on Oct. 27. Even the dress she wore when she sang ''Happy Birthday, Mr. President'' to John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in 1962 will be on the block. Yesterday the dress was on display at Christie's, in Rockefeller Center, and VREDY LYTSMAN, a spokeswoman for Christie's, was saying that the auction house expected the sale price of the flesh-colored, full-length dress to be in ''the high six figures.'' That would put the Monroe auction in the stratospheric range of other big-money celebrity sales -- the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction with the $574,500 humidor and the $442,500 rocking chair, the Diana auction with the $222,500 blue velvet dress, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor auction with the $415,000 mahogany table, to name only three. A conversation with Ms. Valentino leaves no doubt that she believes Marilyn Monroe is worth it. ''She's so present,'' Ms. Valentino said yesterday as camera crews zoomed in on the dress. ''That's the phenomenal thing about her fame. She's so present.'' And what about the future? Well, Ms. Valentino said, ''the century she was so identified with is coming to a close.'' JAMES BARRON
7/27/1999	Ebay Earnings Fell 70% in Second Quarter	Ebay Inc., the on-line auction company, said today that its second-quarter earnings fell 70 percent as it spent more to market its Web site and add more staff and computer systems. Net income fell to $816,000, or 1 cent a diluted share, compared with $2.73 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose to $49.5 million from $19.5 million.
7/15/1999	Another Venture in Art Auctions for Ebay	Greg Manning Auctions Inc. agreed today to form a venture with Ebay Inc.'s Butterfield & Butterfield unit to auction fine art and collectibles on Ebay's Internet site. Financial details of the venture, which is to make its debut this fall, were not disclosed. Greg Manning, an auctioneer of stamps and collectibles based in West Caldwell, said it would supply the items to be auctioned. Ebay is based in San Jose, Calif.
7/8/1999	Video Game Worker Dismissed For Selling Fantasy Real Estate	A popular expression about real estate is ''they're not making more of it.'' But when it comes to virtual real estate, a video game employee not only made more of it -- he lost his job for selling some over the Internet. Last week, a game software maker, Origin Systems, dismissed an employee for earning almost $7,000 by selling fantasy real estate on Ebay, an on-line auction site.
6/23/1999	Ebay Deal in Germany	Ebay Inc. said today that it had acquired the German on-line trading company Alando.de A.G. for an undisclosed sum. Alando.de, with more than 50,000 registered users, will operate under its current address before being changed to ebay.de later this year. It was Ebay's second move into Europe, where it already owns a British auctioning site. Ebay operates the most widely used American Internet auction.
5/24/1999	TECHNOLOGY: Digital Commerce; Artists at the easel, collectors and investors on the prowl: Stories from the success of the auction giant Ebay.	IN addition to being the most important invention since fire, the commercial Internet is, apparently, the perfect parking lot for a global flea market. The overwhelming popularity of the on-line auction giant Ebay -- with a $22 billion market cap and millions of daily visitors -- has inspired a convoy of me-too sites. They range from Amazon.com, branching out from its pure retail roots with a huge advertising campaign to draw people away from Ebay, to the on-line technology site Cnet, which started its auction site for high-technology products last week.
5/20/1999	A Consultant Reports a Flaw In Ebay's Web Site Security	Nothing lasts for long on Ebay, the popular on-line auction house, except, apparently, potential security flaws. Tom Cervenka, a consultant in Edmonton, Alberta, recently found a bug that can redirect personal information -- including passwords -- from the Ebay site (www.ebay.com) to his own computer. But the company has not remedied the security gap.
5/19/1999	EBAY TO BUY ON-LINE BILL PROCESSOR AND A CAR AUCTIONEER	Ebay Inc., the No. 1 on-line auctioneer, agreed yesterday to buy Kruse International, auctioneers of collectible cars, and Billpoint Inc., a provider of on-line payment services, for a combined $275 million in stock. Ebay is expanding the variety of goods it handles as competition in the on-line auction business intensifies from Amazon.com Inc. and other new entrants. Last month, Ebay said it would buy the Butterfield & Butterfield Auctioneers Corporation, a San Francisco-based auction house, for about $260 million in stock, adding high-priced art and other collectibles to its service. Billpoint is based in Redwood City, Calif. Kruse International is based in Auburn, Ind. Both companies are closely held. The stock of Ebay, which is based in San Jose, Calif., fell $8.875 a share, to $189.5625.
5/17/1999	Ebay and Skytel In a Venture	Ebay Inc., the No. 1 on-line auctioneer, and Skytel Communications Inc., the second-largest United States paging company, plan to introduce a service that lets customers monitor and participate in auctions away from their computers. The free service will notify Ebay users through their pagers, cell phones and electronic organizers when they have made a winning bid and when their items sell. It will begin in July and be expanded later to allow users to increase bids using wireless devices.
5/10/1999	Defining the On-Line Chief; Ebay's Meg Whitman Explores Management, Web Style	In a Valley of unexpected millionaires, Meg Whitman is the unlikeliest of billionaires. Ms. Whitman recalls the day in November 1997 that a headhunter urged her to leave her comfortable job promoting Teletubbies at Hasbro Inc. The proposition: to head up a no-name Silicon Valley start-up that needed a chief executive. Her answer was ''no.''
5/4/1999	Changes in Accounts At Several Concerns	Several large advertisers said yesterday that they would make changes involving their accounts. Ebay Inc. in San Jose, Calif., the on-line auction company, named Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco as its agency of record to handle brand-building advertising and other assignments with billings estimated at $15 million to $20 million. Goodby, Silverstein, part of Omnicom Group, has been working for Ebay for several weeks on consumer research and advertising concepts, Adweek reported.
4/27/1999	Internet Auctioneer Ebay to Add Land-Based Rival	In one of the first cases of an Internet company buying its traditional competitor, the electronic auction service Ebay Inc. agreed yesterday to acquire the Butterfield & Butterfield Auctioneers Corporation, San Francisco's largest auction house, for $260 million in stock. Ebay has been one of the most explosive growth companies on the Internet, with a service that lets both individuals and businesses auction off everything from stuffed animals to rare stamps. It is also one of the few profitable Internet concerns. Yesterday, Ebay said it earned $5.9 million in the first quarter, up tenfold from a year earlier.
4/22/1999	The $44,100 Pickle Jar	Pickle jar, circa 1850, that was bought for $3 at tag sale, is sold at Internet auction site, Ebay, for $44,100; photo (M)
4/13/1999	On-Line Auctions: Let's Make a Deal Without the Haggle	There was no question that Bill Rue wanted the toy car, a childhood object that set off memories of 1969, when the Mets won the World Series and his parents bought their first color TV. But it wasn't until he found himself bidding against an anonymous foe in an Internet auction one evening that he knew he must have it. Mr. Rue, a Brooklyn realtor who has no regrets about paying $101 for a used toy that opened at $9, is hardly alone in his embrace of the on-line auction. It is an Internet phenomenon that in a matter of months has captivated the nation's bargain hunters and spawned a market for nostalgia. Day and night, millions of Americans are sweating silently at their computers, bidding electronically on things they have never seen, tendered by people they have never met.
3/30/1999	The Next Trick for Amazon.com: Auctions	Furthering its audacious ambition to be involved virtually any time anyone sells anything on the Internet, Amazon.com plans to let individuals and small businesses conduct auctions on its popular World Wide Web site. The company plans to begin offering the auction capability today from its existing Web site. Shares of Amazon.com rose nearly 8 percent yesterday, closing at $149.625, up $10.5625 in Nasdaq trading, following the company's announcement of the plan late Sunday.
3/26/1999	Ebay to Pay $75 Million for Spots On Several America Online Sites	In one of the largest partnership deals in the short history of the World Wide Web, the on-line auction site Ebay announced today that it would pay $75 million for prominent placement on several services owned by America Online Inc. The four-year deal establishes Ebay as the official auction site on America Online's proprietary service and its other on-line properties, including AOL.com, Compuserve, the chat service ICQ and the company's newest acquisition, the Netcenter Web portal of Netscape Communications Corporation.
3/2/1999	Ebay Stock Falls On U.S. Inquiry	The on-line auction site Ebay, which has already gained the attention of New York City consumer officials, now says it is under Federal investigation for ''possible illegal transactions.'' The company issued a terse release about the inquiry late Friday, withholding details about the substance ''to protect the investigations,'' but saying that it was ''fully cooperating.''
2/18/1999	A Niche Market on Line	To the Editor: I read ''Buying is Only a Click (Oops!) Away'' (Feb. 11) and wanted to share my experience. Through Ebay, I was able to find a woman who has been supplying me with chipped plates, which I use to make mosaic picture frames, mirrors and other items. A cyberspace twist for a cottage industry. MARSHA EDELL Larchmont, N.Y., Feb. 11, 1999
2/3/1999	Ebay Expands Auctions	Margaret C. Whitman, the chief executive of Ebay Inc., an on-line auctioneer, said the company had started offering auctions in Canada and Britain, expanding its service outside the United States for the first time. The new services started operating last week, said Ms. Whitman, speaking at the NationsBanc Montgomery Securities technology conference in San Francisco. Ebay, which lets individuals and small businesses buy and sell items ranging from coffee pots to antique dolls on the Internet, makes money by charging listing fees and taking a portion of each sale.
1/26/1999	Internet Auctioneer Facing Fraud Inquiry	Ebay Inc., the Internet auctioneer, is under investigation by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs over users' complaints about fraud. Ebay, which does not sell any merchandise itself, runs on-line auctions and makes money by charging listing fees and taking a cut of each sale. The New York agency has not concluded whether Ebay could be held legally liable for the actions of people who use its service to buy and sell collectibles and other items.
1/16/1999	Ebay to Offer Free Insurance and ID System	Ebay Inc., the Internet auctioneer, said today that it would offer free insurance and a user-identification system to increase users' confidence in the security of its on-line trading network. Ebay, which holds auctions for small businesses and individuals, said it would begin in March to provide users with insurance through Lloyd's of London for transactions from $25 to $200.
1/3/1999	Going, Going, Gone on Line	I JUST bid $180 for a Donna Karan black cashmere sweater I've never seen. It's supposed to be new, but for all I know it has spent the last three years locked in a closet with bulimic moths. Until very recently I had assumed that anyone foolish enough to buy anything through an Internet auction had too much time, money or both. But today, I find myself eager to shell out $100 for a used scarf. How did this happen?
12/24/1998	Dog Days for Some Ebay Critics	THEY call themselves the Ebay 14. While the name may sound like a group of political prisoners, they are actually a handful of pet advocates who say they got kicked off Ebay.com, the on-line auction service, after complaining about the auction of several St. Bernard puppies this month. The 14, with canine-style E-mail names like stbernard1, rridgebacks and rescue, said they were suspended from the service for sending messages protesting the auction of the dogs on Dec. 16. Members of the group oppose such auctions because they think that buying a pet through the Internet is ill-advised.
11/15/1998	Creator of the On-Line Swap Meet	WHAT really captivates him, Pierre Omidyar says, are computer-programming challenges. But he says he never expected to get rich tackling them, and recalls that most of his efforts to make money on them failed. With one huge exception. Three weeks ago, Gary Bengier, the chief financial officer of Ebay Inc., the company Mr. Omidyar founded in 1995, walked into his office to congratulate him.
9/25/1998	THE MARKETS: Market Place; The debut of an on-line auction house reminds investors of the glories of initial offerings gone by.	NOW we know what it takes to shake Wall Street's I.P.O. blues: Beanie Babies and lots of them. In the first initial public offering in nearly a month, shares of Ebay, an Internet auction house, jumped from the offering price of $18 to close at $47.375.
9/24/1998	FIRST INITIAL STOCK SALE IN 4 WEEKS RAISES $63 MILLION	Ebay Inc., operator of an Internet auction site, raised $63 million yesterday in the first initial stock sale in four weeks. The company, in San Jose, Calif., sold 3.5 million shares at $18 each, the top of the $16-to-$18 range set by the lead underwriter, Goldman, Sachs & Company. The initial offering gave the three-year-old company a market capitalization of $715.3 million and its 31-year-old founder and chairman, Pierre M. Omidyar, a stake worth about $274.1 million. Ebay shares are expected to do well as they begin trading today, analysts said, even though the initial offerings market has been battered for months.
4/2/1998	Hackers' Bazaar; On-Line Auction Services Put Haggling Back Into Sales	You can usually haggle over the price of a car, or cut a better deal for that rowing machine at a garage sale. But an airline ticket? Imagine walking up to an airline counter, flashing a wad of bills and offering $300 for a ticket to Florida when the lowest available fare is $400. The ticket agent would probably call security.
