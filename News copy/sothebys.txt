2012-05-03	If I Had the Cash, I Wouldn't Buy That	My first live encounter with ''The Scream,'' by Edvard Munch, was during a December stay in Oslo several decades ago.

Two of the four existing versions of it have, at different times, been stolen from Oslo museums and later recovered. On Wednesday an 1895 pastel version of the picture sold for $119.9 million at Sotheby's in New York, setting an auction record and proving, yet again, that whatever shape the economy is in, there's no limit to private cash and art is a place where people like to park it.
2012-05-02	'The Scream' Is Auctioned for a Record Price, $119.9 Million	It took 12 nail-biting minutes and five eager bidders for Edvard Munch's famed 1895 pastel of ''The Scream'' to sell for $119.9 million, becoming the world's most expensive work of art ever to sell at auction. Bidders could be heard speaking Chinese and English (and, some said, Norwegian), but the mystery winner bid over the phone, through Charles Moffett, Sotheby's executive vice president and vice chairman of its worldwide Impressionist, modern and contemporary art department. Gasps could be heard as the bidding climbed higher and higher, until there was a pause at $99 million, prompting Tobias Meyer, the evening's auctioneer, to smile and say, ''I have all the time in the world.'' When $100 million was bid, the audience began to applaud.

2012-04-07	Judge Says Cambodian Statue Will Stay With Sotheby's for Now	Ruling against the immediate seizure of a 1,000-year-old Cambodian statue the United States and Cambodian governments say was looted from its temple site, a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday gave Sotheby's continued custody of the antiquity and called a conference on the case for April 12. The judge, George B. Daniels, signed a restraining order directing Sotheby's not to dispose of the sandstone statue, which the auction house had planned to sell for an unidentified Belgian client for up to $3 million last year, and to make it available for inspection by the Department of Homeland Security, which had sought its forfeiture as stolen property.

But a lawyer for Sotheby's, Peter G. Neiman, said in court papers that the company's bid to sell the antiquity on behalf of an anonymous Belgian collector was legal under its interpretation of American and Cambodian cultural property laws.

A rarely enforced California law, the only one of its type in the country, requires anyone reselling a piece of fine art who lives in the state, or who sells the art there for $1,000 or more, to pay the artist 5 percent of the resale price. The law, on the books since 1977, aroused renewed attention this fall after Chuck Close, Laddie John Dill and the estate of the sculptor Robert Graham brought class action suits against Christie's, Sotheby's and E-bay.
2012-01-24	Schoolgirl's Embroidery Fetches $1.07 Million	In 1807, a New Jersey schoolgirl named Mary Antrim embroidered a farm scene with silk thread on linen. On Sunday, Sotheby's in New York sold her view of livestock, picket fences and clapboarded outbuildings for $1.07 million (the top estimate had been $120,000), setting an auction record for a needlework sampler. The sale contained 198 lots from the collection of the needlework historian Betty Ring. Of all the colorful pastoral views at the Sotheby's showroom, Mary Antrim's piece ''stood out in a unique way as a folk art statement,'' said the dealer David Schorsch, who bought it for an undisclosed client. The auction's other top prices were in the low six figures and shared by the specialist dealers Stephen and Carol Huber and Amy Finkel. A quarter of the Ring material did not sell, especially images of veiled mourners and gravestones sewn in memory of deceased relatives. The buzz in the field this week, Mr. Huber said, is that ''the memorials all died.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2011-12-20	Orson Welles's Oscar Has a New Owner	"LOS ANGELES -The Orson Welles Oscar went to the highest-and unidentified -- bidder for $861,542, the Nate D. Sanders auction house said Tuesday evening. Welles received the Oscar in 1942 for his work on the script for ""Citizen Kane."" It was thought to be lost and later replaced. But eventually the original turned up in the hands of a cinematographer who said he had received it from Welles as a gift, and, after a court fight, it was turned over to Welles's daughter Beatrice. When the original first went on the block, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences went to court to try to stop the sale, but lost. Sotheby's later tried to sell it, but ended that effort when an undisclosed reserve price was not met. And, now, finally the Oscar has been sold in an auction that, according to Sanders, included an underbid from the magician David Copperfield. ""I'm proud to have represented this fantastic award to the cinema collecting community,"" Nate D. Sanders, the auction house owner, said in a statement that was circulated late Tuesday."

The sale was not only a record for a Bronte manuscript but also a significant blow to the Bronte Parsonage Museum in Haworth, West Yorkshire, which had received a grant of more than $900,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, along with a number of public donations, after an appeal to keep the 1.5 by 2.5-inch manuscript in Britain.

The collection, assembled more than 100 years ago by Archer M. Huntington, the founder of the Hispanic Society, will be offered as a single lot in sealed bid auction beginning Thursday and ending next March. Considered one of the most important collections outside of Spain related to Spanish history, it includes the ''50 Excelentes,'' a gold coin weighing nearly five ounces created in the 15th century, during the period of Christopher Columbus's voyages to the New World. The coin, according to a statement from Sotheby's, ''is the largest gold coin from the 15th century that survives today.'' In addition, there are more than 400 Roman gold coins that span the full history of Rome, including examples struck under Julius Caesar.

2011-11-24	Raymond Chandler's Life: Clues in an Auction	''The very nicest thing Hollywood can possibly think of to say to a writer,'' Raymond Chandlerwrote, ''is that he is too good to be only a writer.'' Chandler may have been only a writer himself, but he was a singularly influential one, whose body of work includes the classic detective novels ''The Big Sleep'' and ''Farewell, My Lovely'' and contributions to the screenplays for ''Double Indemnity'' (written with Billy Wilder) and ''Strangers on a Train.'' Now a sale of books and papers from Chandler's personal collection offers a unique look at his legacy and literary influence, not to mention his uneasy relationship with that ''showman's paradise,'' as he called it, known as Hollywood. On Dec. 13 Sotheby's will sell at an auction in New York a collection of Chandler's books and other works from the library of Jean Vounder-Davis, who was the author's fiancee and secretary until his death in 1959, the auction house said on Wednesday. Among the items in the sale is a copy of ''The Big Sleep,'' the first novel to feature his detective character Philip Marlowe, inscribed to Chandler's wife, Cissy. (The dedication reads in part, ''For my Cissy who wants something much better, but was pleased even with this.'') Another copy of ''The Big Sleep'' also for sale at the auction is dedicated by Chandler to himself, with the inscription, ''For me without my compliments.''

The Moment recently reported on the Pink Swan Project, in which designers riffed on Arne Jacobsen's classic Swan chair. Now comes Kartell Loves Milano, an auction on Oct. 25 by Sotheby's at the Rotondo della Besana in Milan. Proceeds from the sale will benefit the Umberto Veronesi Foundation, which supports scientific research. (Its founder, for whom the foundation is named, is a surgeon and oncologist known for his innovations in cancer treatment.) For the auction, 45 individuals and groups - from the worlds of design and architecture, art, fashion, music, photography, food and even sports - will reimagine one of the Italian manufacturer Kartell's plastic furniture designs, while also paying tribute to the city of Milan, Italy's design and fashion center. While it's now become commonplace to see a fashion house like Missoni or DSquared2 reworking a chair or a mirror, it's still a novelty when the soccer club A.C. Milan or the D.J. Linus does it. An interesting design-world statistic: of the 45 participants, 29 chose to put their stamp on pieces designed by Philippe Starck - including Starck himself, who has probably done more than any other designer to make Kartell, which pioneered plastic furniture designs in the 1950s, a global brand today.

The agreement called for Sotheby's to try to sell the four as a group to a museum by Monday; if it were unable to do so, the works - which together are estimated to be worth more than $50 million - would then go to auction separately. Christie's, the rival auction house that had competed for the sale, was so miffed by Denver's selection of Sotheby's that it hired lawyers and lobbyists in an unsuccessful effort to stop the arrangement.

Austen wrote ''The Watsons,'' an unfinished and unpublished novel, in 1804. It is the story of a poverty-stricken young woman whose only friend is her ailing clergyman father. A Sotheby's book specialist, Gabriel Heaton, said the draft ''has afforded an extremely broad audience an insight into the author's process and reworkings.''

Mr. Zhang, who is 52 and based in Beijing, is now among a handful of living artists to have a work sell for more than $10 million. Less than a decade ago, many of his works were selling for $60,000 or less. He joins a group that includes Lucian Freud, Damien Hirst, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami and Gerhard Richter, according to Artprice.com.

So it was with great fanfare that in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning, Sotheby's announced the forthcoming sale of 106 works dating from the 1980s and early 1990s. The works belong to Guy Ullens and his wife, Myriam, Belgium collectors who opened the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in a former munitions complex in Beijing's Dashanzi warehouse arts district in 2007. The Sotheby's auction will take place on April 3 in Hong Kong and is expected to bring $12.7 million to $16.7 million. For sale will be everything from paintings and sculpture to photography and installations. Among the highlights are Zhang Xiaogang's triptych ''Forever Lasting Love'' (1988), which is estimated at $3.2 million to $3.8 million, and Wang Guangyi's ''Mao Zedong: P2, 1988,'' one of the earliest paintings from that artist's series of Mao images. In this one he has superimposed lines and symbols on top of a silhouette of the leader. It is expected to sell for $190,000 to $260,000.

2010-12-11	Sheet of Dylan's Lyrics Is Sold at Auction	The ownership of Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics to ''The Times They Are a-Changin''' will soon be a-changin' hands: on Friday, a weathered sheet of ruled paper on which Mr. Dylan scrawled most of the verses to that classic protest song were sold at an auction for $422,500, a representative for Sotheby's said. The auction house said the winning bid, which includes the house's commission, was made by Adam Sender, whom it identified as an American collector; he is also a hedge fund trader whose office is home to works by Ed Ruscha, Kara Walker and John Currin, according to a recent report by Bloomberg News. Mr. Sender took part in the auction by phone and outbid three other contenders to claim his trophy, which Sotheby's expected to fetch $200,000 to $300,000. With this lot Mr. Sender does not receive the verse that begins, ''Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,'' which Mr. Dylan apparently added later, nor does he own the 1960s, which belong to everyone, man. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2010-11-30	Sign of the 'Times': Dylan's Lyrics for Sale	Come gather 'round, people: if your cash to you is worth spending on a one-of-a-kind piece of Bob Dylan memorabilia, you might consider saving the date of Dec. 10. That's when Sotheby's plans to auction Mr. Dylan's handwritten lyrics to ''The Times They Are a-Changin''' as part of a larger sale of books and manuscripts, the auction house said on Monday. In a catalog listing, Sotheby's described the item as ''a sheet of unruled three-hole notebook paper'' on which Mr. Dylan wrote four verses of the famous protest song in simple block lettering (which you can see in closer detail here). He later recorded it for his 1964 album of the same title. (The verse that begins, ''Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,'' does not appear in the document, though a fragment of lyrics from Mr. Dylan's song ''North Country Blues'' can be seen on the reverse side.) Selby Kiffer, a senior vice president in Sotheby's books and manuscripts department, said the document was originally given to Kevin Krown, a fellow folk singer, by Mr. Dylan, who had a tendency to toss away his lyric sheets once he'd committed his songs to memory. When Mr. Krown died in the 1990s, the lyrics were passed along to Mac and Eve MacKenzie, who hosted Mr. Dylan in their Manhattan home on some of his earliest visits to New York.

2010-10-12	That's So 19th Century: Moore Goes Modern	The manner in which the 19th-century artist William Bouguereau depicted women - with a combination of ''gentleness, serenity and strength'' - as Demi Moore put it, is what drew the actress to his work. So in 1995, when ''Frere et Soeur,'' an 1887 canvas of a young girl carrying her baby brother, came up for sale at a Christie's auction in New York, she bought it for $178,500. It wasn't all she purchased at that sale. Ms. Moore also snapped up a painting by the Belgian artist Alfred Stevens, from 1883, called ''Mere et Ses Enfants,'' for $200,500. Now Ms. Moore is selling both paintings at a Sotheby's sale of 19th-century European art in New York on Nov. 4. If things go well Ms. Moore stands to make a hefty profit on the Bouguereau as it is expected to fetch $1 million to $1.5 million, but not on the Stevens, which is estimated to bring $150,000 to $200,000.

Both the auction and the book reveal Hall's connoisseurship and her close relationships with distinguished artists.

The painting, more than 5 feet by 4 feet, shows Picasso's mistress Marie-Therese Walter, both reclining and as a bust. Picasso's profile can be discerned in the blue background.

2009-11-02	19th-Century Letters, 21st-Century Price	Sotheby's of London has sold a collection of racy letters written by Lord Byron, below, for $455,466, more than $150,000 above the estimate and a record price for letters by a British Romantic poet. According to BBC News, an anonymous bidder bought the 71 pages of letters and fragments, dating from 1808, which include details of an affair with a servant girl and a disparaging reference to William Wordsworth. The documents came from the library of Archibald Primrose, prime minister from 1894 to 1895. Gabriel Heaton, a Sotheby's specialist in British literature and history, told the BBC that the letters, to Byron's close friend the Rev. Francis Hodgson, ''offered a wonderful opportunity to reveal aspects of Lord Byron's character that were either unknown or long forgotten.''

But Lexington Avenue is a street of surprises, including Bernard Madoff's former apartment house at the corner of East 64th Street, built in 1927 for a Social Register crowd that eschewed the typical well-to-do East Side address for an old shoe life in the slow lane. Compared with the prestige of Fifth, Madison and Park, Lexington above 59th is a sort of hand-me-down address, with altered brownstones and midgrade apartment houses, in keeping with its lower rung on the social ladder.

A publicly traded company, Sotheby’s also announced on Tuesday that it would reduce its dividend to 20 cents a share from 60 cents.

Sales at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips de Pury & Company brought in a combined $102 million, against minimum estimates of $184 million, according to Bloomberg's calculations. The auctions, coinciding with the Frieze Art Fair, were the first big test for the art market since the recent plunge in global stock markets and the government bailouts of banking institutions. Dealers were watching for clues to what will happen at New York sales in November. ''These are old prices,'' said the New York dealer Alberto Mugrabi, whose family owns one of the largest Andy Warhol collections, explaining why he let a Warhol pass by at Christie's on Sunday night. ''They would have to be readjusted.'' The contemporary-art market has enjoyed a bull run for the past five years, with prices for artists including Warhol, Takashi Murakami and Richard Prince more than quadrupling.

2008-05-04	FOREIGN ENTICEMENTS	IN an overture to Russia's new rich, Sotheby's sent highlights of its big spring sale of contemporary art from New York to Moscow this year for the first time. Sotheby's also has works that should appeal to new collectors in other emerging markets. Curiously, fewer examples of today's hot Chinese contemporary artists are on offer than a year ago, but Sotheby's contemporary sale on May 14 includes examples by two of today's most sought-after artists from Russia and India. Erik Bulatov, a Russian born in 1933, is being represented for the first time with his painting ''New York.'' And the auction also includes a 2003 painting by the Indian artist Subodh Gupta, ''Across the Seven Seas,'' which depicts a bustling airport. Its $500,000 to $700,000 estimate isn't cheap, but Mr. Gupta, 44, is considered one of the hottest artists of his generation in India. His work has been exhibited in high-profile shows like the 2005 Venice Biennale.
2007-12-14	J. K. Rowling Hasthe Midas Touch	A single volume of five fairy tales by J. K. Rowling, handwritten on translucent vellum and illustrated by her, sold for $3.97 million at auction at Sotheby's in London, Agence France-Presse reported. The book, ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard,'' above, bound in leather and covered with silver and jewels, sold for about 40 times its pre-sale estimate. ''The price achieved today stands as the highest price ever achieved at auction for a modern literary manuscript, an auction record for a work by J. K. Rowling and an auction record for a children's book,'' a Sotheby's spokeswoman said in a statement. The winning bidder was the fine-art dealer Hazlitt, Good & Fox of London. Only seven copies of the book were produced; the author gave six to people associated with her Harry Potter tales. Proceeds from the sale will go to Children's Voice, a charity Ms. Rowling helped found, to help children in Europe.
2007-12-14	Trumans Daughter Sells Churchill Landscape	A painting by Winston Churchill inherited by Margaret Truman Daniel, the daughter of President Harry S.

Churchill gave the landscape painting, ''Marrakech,'' right, to Truman in 1951, saying it was ''about as presentable as anything I can produce.'' Prices for Churchill's art have been rising.
2007-12-07	Turner Watercolor Fetches Millions	A J. M. W. Turner watercolor masterpiece, above, unseen in public for nearly 120 years, was sold to an unidentified American collector for $5.9 million at an auction late on Wednesday at Sotheby's in London, the BBC reported. The painting, dating from the 1830s, was last seen in public 17 years after it was bought in 1872 by the Earl of Dudley. It eventually was sold to the Vanderbilt family and passed through generations before being placed on the open market for the first time in 135 years. The watercolor depicts Bamborough Castle, perched on an outcrop at the edge of the North Sea, during a storm that has driven a ship onto the rocks.
2007-11-24	A Queen Is Auctioned	The earliest known full-length portrait of Queen Elizabeth I was sold at Sotheby's in London for £2.6 million (about $5.4 million), Bloomberg News reported yesterday. The price was a record for any British royal portrait, the auction house said, and more than double the pre-auction estimate. The winning bidder was Philip Mould, a London art dealer, who bought the portrait, above, along with another dealer. The painting was originally given by the queen to Griffith Hampden, the sheriff of Buckinghamshire, on a visit to Hampden House, Sotheby's said. The image dates from the 1560s and may have been painted by the Antwerp artist Steven van der Meulen. The work may have been intended to attract potential suitors, but Queen Elizabeth, known as the Virgin Queen, never married.
2007-10-18	Grand Salons for Parisian Antiques	On Oct. 25 and 26, Sotheby's will auction furniture and decorative objects belonging to Ariane Dandois, a Parisian antiques dealer who has closed her three-level gallery on the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré. Known for her high style and indomitable will, Ms. Dandois, above, persuaded the auction house to hire Juan Pablo Molyneux, the New York decorator, to transform its 10th-floor exhibition galleries into a series of grand salons to display her wares. In one 18-foot-tall room, left, enlarged Piranesi drawings provide a backdrop to pieces that include a 19th-century Empire mahogany secretaire with matching chiffonier ($250,000 to $350,000); a Russian neoclassical table with gilt-winged legs ($20,000 to $30,000); and a pair of circa 1770 Italian gilt wood chairs ($70,000 to $10,000). Dramatic images of St. Petersburg palace interiors adorn the walls of a nearby salon, above. ''Juan Pablo Photo-shopped the grand staircase of the Hermitage,'' said Ms. Dandois's daughter, Ondine, who helped organize the auction. The room contains a Spanish neoclassical ormolu-mounted mahogany desk, above, that also functions as a dressing table ($200,000 to $300,000). The pre-auction exhibition is open to the public from Oct. 20 to 24 at Sotheby's, 1334 York Avenue (72nd Street). Information: (212) 606-7000 or www.sothebys.com.CHRISTOPHER MASON
2007-08-08	Sotheby's Profit Rises 48%	
2007-06-08	Arts, Briefly	Sculpture Sale Is a Record An ancient Roman bronze sculpture of the goddess Artemis with a stag, left, was sold yesterday at Sotheby's in New York for $28.6 million, the highest price ever paid for a sculpture or an antiquity at auction. The London dealer Giuseppe Eskenazi said he bought the work, dating from the first century B.C. to the first century A.D., on behalf of a private European collector whom he declined to identify. Sotheby's had estimated that the sculpture would go for $5 million to $7 million. The sculpture had been in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, which is in the midst of a controversial sale of older works so that it can raise money to finance purchases of contemporary art. Richard M. Keresey, an antiquities specialist at Sotheby's, had called the 36-inch-tall bronze ''the best single piece I've seen here in 37 years.'' The previous auction record for a sculpture was set in May 2005 when Brancusi's ''Bird in Space'' went for $27.5 million at Christie's in New York; the previous auction record for an antiquity was the $11.6 million paid for the so-called Jenkins Venus, a marble statue, at Christie's in London in June 2002. Reached on his cellphone Mr. Eskenazi said that he jumped into the bidding after the price reached $14 million and then squared off against one remaining bidder. ''He was very determined -- I thought he'd never give up,'' he said. ''I feel exhaustion, to be honest.'' Mr. Eskenazi triumphed with a hammer price of $25.5 million. (Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) Akon in Trouble The platinum-selling singer Akon, above, is under investigation after a clash that ended with him tossing a teenage concertgoer off the stage and onto an audience member who said she suffered a concussion, The Associated Press reported. Witnesses said the trouble erupted Sunday at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, N.Y., where a spectator threw something at the singer, and Akon, 34, asked the crowd to point out the culprit. A guard singled out a 15-year-old boy, whose name was not released, and sent him to the stage, where Akon hurled him into the audience, The Poughkeepsie Journal reported. The boy landed on Abby Rosa, who said she soon experienced a headache and blurry vision. Detective Lt. John Berlingieri of the Fishkill Police said no criminal charges had yet been filed. Earlier this year Akon caused a furor with a sexually explicit onstage dance with a girl later revealed to be 14. He apologized, saying he did not know she was under-age. Sean Connery Resigns His Professorship Sean Connery said yesterday that he won't be playing dad to Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones anymore, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Connery, 76, played Prof. Henry Jones, father of the intrepid archeologist, in the 1989 adventure ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' below. With a fourth Indian Jones film, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by George Lucas, scheduled to go before the cameras this month, speculation had mounted that Mr. Connery would return, although he had announced his retirement from acting in 2005. ''I thought long and hard about it, and if anything could have pulled me out of retirement, it would have been an Indiana Jones film,'' he said in a statement posted on the Lucasfilm Indiana Jones Web site (www.indianajones.com). ''But in the end, retirement is just too damned much fun.'' The film is scheduled for release in May 2008. Patricia Cornwell Wins Injunction A federal judge in Richmond, Va., has ordered Leslie R. Sachs, a self-published author, to end an Internet vendetta that leveled accusations of plagiarism, bribery and anti-Semitism against Patricia Cornwell, below, the best-selling author of novels featuring the medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Sachs even contended that Ms. Cornwell was plotting to have him murdered. Ms. Cornwell, 50, said Mr. Sachs, 52, had made no direct threats but said his allegations had caused her fear, anxiety and sleeplessness. After long ignoring him she sued Mr. Sachs for libel when the Internet attacks increased. Judge Norman K. Moon granted Ms. Cornwell's motion for a permanent injunction, saying that the statements were false and ''calculated to expose plaintiff to public contempt or ridicule'' and were published with actual malice. Mr. Sachs did not immediately respond to an e-mail message from The Associated Press seeking comment. British 'Big Brother' Contestant Expelled An allegation of racism has led to the ouster of a contestant from the British reality television show ''Big Brother,'' The Associated Press reported. Emily Parr, 19, a student, was removed after using a derogatory term about a black contestant on Wednesday night, Channel 4 in Britain said yesterday. The remark was not broadcast live. Channel 4 was forced to apologize two weeks ago after regulators ruled that the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' program violated broadcasting rules by showing footage of racist insults directed at the Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. Channel 4 said that in light of reaction to the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' incident it had not choice but to expel Ms. Parr.
2007-06-01	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Arbitration For Sotheby's	A State Supreme Court judge has granted Sotheby's auction house a temporary restraining order that blocks its landlord from selling its longtime home on York Avenue while the two sides wrestle over the property. The developer Aby Rosen bought the 10-story building from Sotheby's in 2002 for $175 million and leased it back to the company. The two sides had a falling out earlier this year when Mr. Rosen put the building up for sale. Sotheby's contends that it has the right under the terms of its lease to buy the building for a fraction of the $465 million Mr. Rose has demanded. The injunction, granted on Wednesday, allows the two to proceed with what is known as baseball arbitration, in which an arbitrator declares one side or the other the winner. CHARLES V. BAGLI
2007-05-18	Arts, Briefly; From Albright-Knox, a Benin Bronze	A 17th-century bronze head from the Kingdom of Benin, a precolonial civilization in what is now southern Nigeria, sold yesterday at Sotheby's for $4.74 million, against an estimate of $1 million to $1.5 million. It had been in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, which is selling -- over the protests of some patrons -- several older works to increase its endowment for buying contemporary art. In March, the first in the series of sales made the gallery more than $18 million. A rare 10th-century granite statue depicting the Hindu god Shiva as Brahma sold to the Cleveland Museum of Art for slightly more than $4 million, an auction record for a work of traditional Indian art. The cast Benin head, nine inches tall, depicts a king, or oba. The artistic mastery of sculptures like this helped change Western views of African culture when they became known in Europe.

Yesterday, the Cleveland Museum of Art did, announcing that it was the winning bidder for a rare 10th-century granite statue that sold late last month for $4.07 million at Sotheby's, setting an auction record for a work of traditional Indian art. The statue, above, depicting the Hindu god Shiva as Brahma, was sold by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, which is getting rid of many older works to increase its endowment for buying contemporary art. John Eskenazi, a London dealer, bid on behalf of the Cleveland museum, which has a world-class collection of Indian art. RANDY KENNEDY
2007-03-24	Arts, Briefly	A Museum Sale Sets a Record A 10th-century granite statue owned by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo went for $4.07 million yesterday at Sotheby's in New York, setting an auction record for a work of traditional Indian art. The statue, depicting the Hindu god Shiva as Brahma, above, was purchased by John Eskenazi, a London dealer assumed to be acting for an anonymous buyer. The previous auction record for classical Indian art was set on Wednesday at Christie's, where a bronze statue of a goddess went for $2.7 million. The auction is one of a series at Sotheby's through which the Albright-Knox is divesting itself of centuries-old pieces of Chinese, Indian, South American and ancient Roman art. The museum said the pieces were irrelevant to its central mission, which is contemporary art, but the decision has stirred controversy in Buffalo and the art world. The 11 works offered by the Albright-Knox in yesterday's sale brought in $7.2 million, including Sotheby's commission. On Tuesday the museum made more than $18 million in a sale of Chinese artifacts. Star Power The actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, whose only film together, ''Titanic,'' in 1997, earned more than $1.8 billion at the box office, the most of any movie in history, will star in ''Revolutionary Road,'' Variety reported yesterday. DreamWorks will make the film, which is based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates about disillusionment in 1950s America, as told through the disintegrating marriage of a suburban couple. Sam Mendes, the director of ''American Beauty'' and Ms. Winslet's husband, will direct. Justin Haythe will write the screenplay. A Big Book Prize The Jewish Book Council named Tamar Yellin, the author of ''The Genizah at the House of Shepher,'' a novel that follows a biblical scholar as she tracks her family's history in Jerusalem and the Middle East, the first recipient of what will be the annual $100,000 Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature. The prize was established in honor of Mr. Rohr by his family to recognize emerging writers of exceptional literary merit whose work stimulates an interest in Jewish themes. Two runners-up -- Amir Gutfreund, author of ''Our Holocaust,'' and Michael Lavigne, author of ''Not Me'' -- will each receive the Choice Award and $7,500. The awards committee included the novelist Rebecca Goldstein; Jeremy Dauber, a professor of Yiddish at Columbia; Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly; Jonathan Rosen, the editorial director of Nextbook; and Ruth Wisse, professor of Yiddish and comparative literature at Harvard. The three winners will be honored at a ceremony in Manhattan on May 21. Ancient Art, Home Safely Two rare artifacts that Greece says were looted from its soil have arrived in Athens after their handover by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Greek Culture Ministry said yesterday. A ministry official said the items, a gold funerary wreath from the fourth century B.C. and a marble woman's torso from the sixth century B.C., were in excellent condition and would be permanently exhibited at the Archaeological Museum in Athens. The Getty agreed to return the two objects last December after reviewing evidence presented by the Greek government, which had argued for about a decade that the pieces had been illegally removed from the country. The Getty acquired both objects in 1993 for about $4.4 million. The wreath figures into a Greek investigation of a former Getty museum curator, Marion True, and Christophe Léon, a Swiss-based art dealer involved in the Getty purchase. Last summer the Getty transferred ownership of a fourth-century-B.C. engraved funeral stele and a late fifth-century-B.C. engraved sculpture to Greece. Practice, Practice Carnegie Hall announced on Friday that the soprano Anna Netrebko would make her Carnegie Hall debut in a concert of opera arias and duets with the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky and the Orchestra of St. Luke's on May 30 in the Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage. The program will include selections from operas by Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Verdi. The Gang's All Here Warner Brothers said yesterday that Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson would continue to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' and ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' the final two movie adaptations of J. K. Rowling's book series, according to Business Wire. There had been rumors that Ms. Watson might not want to continue in her role.
2007-03-09	Inside Art	Dealer Ready to Part With Four Cézannes Although Giuseppe Eskenazi is one of the world's leading dealers in Asian art, he has a private passion for primarily European works on paper. For more than 30 years he has been quietly collecting prime examples of drawings, sketches and watercolors by modern masters like Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso and Mondrian. ''When I come home, I want a break from the things I look at in the gallery all day,'' Mr. Eskenazi, who is based in London, said in a telephone interview. ''I also think there is such a thing as a conflict of interest when dealers compete with their clients by collecting the same things they sell.''
2007-02-08	Arts, Briefly; Sotheby's Plants Flag	Christie's began holding auctions in Dubai in May. Yesterday its archrival, Sotheby's, announced plans to strengthen its presence in the Gulf of Arabia region too. The company appointed Roxane Zand, an art adviser, to be director of Sotheby's Middle East and Gulf Region. Although Sotheby's executives said they had no immediate plans to hold sales in the Middle East, they intend to become involved in educational initiatives, sell jewelry there and send highlights from coming sales to cities like Dubai.

2007-02-03	Arts, Briefly	At the Crossroads of Money and Art Sotheby's auction house will begin a four-day art sale in London on Tuesday that is expected to be the largest, in financial terms, ever held in Europe, The Guardian reported. Estimates for total sales are more than £200 million ($393 million). Sotheby's will try to auction off so many works, by artists from Degas to Schiele to Warhol and the graffiti artist Banksy (above, his ''Bombing Middle England'') that it will erect a separate temporary viewing space in Hanover Square Gardens in London today to show some of the more recent art. Whither Modernity? Documenta, the art show founded in 1955 and held every five years since 1959 in Kassel, Germany, will this year examine whether modernity is ''dead or alive,'' Bloomberg News reported. The main theme when the show opens on June 16, organizers said at a briefing held at Tate Modern in London on Thursday, is the question: Is modernity still alive, after ''the totalitarian catastrophes of the 20th century''? Another theme, the organizers said, will be the vulnerability of all life. As to the artists who will appear, Documenta's artistic director, Roger M. Buergel, would say only, ''We have announced the artists whose names start with A and Z, and that's it.'' ''A'' is Ferran Adrià, the famous Spanish chef; ''Z'' is Artur Zmijewski, a Polish artist whose work ''Deaf Bach (Singing Lesson 2)'' -- a recording of a Bach cantata sung simultaneously by a soprano and a group of deaf singers -- was played during the news conference. Police and 'Big Brother' A contestant in the British reality television show ''Celebrity Big Brother'' has been questioned by the police about the recent controversy over racist bullying on the show, her lawyers said on Friday, according to Reuters. The contestant, Danielle Lloyd, 23, a former Miss Great Britain, was interviewed on Thursday over comments that she and several other contestants were said to have made about the Indian actress Shilpa Shetty. Ms. Lloyd had requested the interview ''because she wanted to cooperate'' in a police investigation of the incident, her spokeswoman told The Sun. Theoretically, the police could charge show members with incitement to racial hatred, which carries a maximum seven-year jail term. NBC Subs for 'Studio 60' NBC's new series ''The Black Donnellys'' will have its premiere on March 5 at 10 p.m., Eastern time, supplanting ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,'' the series from Aaron Sorkin, which will return later this season at a date to be determined, Kevin Reilly, the president of NBC Entertainment, announced yesterday. The new show follows four working-class Irish-American brothers and their involvement in organized crime in New York City. It was created by Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco, who won an Academy Award for the movie ''Crash.'' Dog Digs Up Trouble A woman in Honolulu sued Duane Chapman, known as Dog, below, the star of ''Dog, the Bounty Hunter'' on A&E, on Thursday, asserting that a member of his team had thrown her down a flight of stairs and broken her back while they were capturing her boyfriend, The Associated Press reported. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the woman, Audrey Emery, and others, seeking unspecified damages. Mr. Chapman and his wife, Beth, said in a statement that their family had become a ''target of frivolous lawsuits and publicity-seeking attorneys.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Chapman, 53, is waiting for a ruling by a Mexican judge about his pending extradition in a criminal case in which he has been charged under Mexican law with ''deprivation of liberty'' for his June 2003 capture of Andrew Luster, a fugitive convicted rapist, in Puerto Vallarta. Brandy Is Sued The parents of a woman killed in a car crash involving Brandy has sued her for $50 million. The wrongful-death suit claims that Brandy, the actress and singer, was driving recklessly when her Land Rover struck the back of a Honda driven by Awatef Aboudihaj, 38, according to reports. The suit was filed on behalf of Aboudihaj Ahmed and Labridi Zohra in Los Angeles Superior Court. It came a day after the California Highway Patrol recommended that Brandy, 27, be charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter in the Dec. 30 accident. ''The accident was a terrible tragedy, and Brandy's heart goes out to Awatef Aboudihaj's family,'' said Allan Mayer, a spokesman for the singer, whose real name is Brandy Norwood. James Brown's Partner Sues The partner of James Brown, Tomi Rae Hynie, below, is suing for half of his estate and access to their home. She has filed a petition in probate court in South Carolina asserting that she is Mr. Brown's surviving spouse and asking for access to his house to retrieve personal possessions. Ms. Hynie, 36, said she had been locked out of the house after Mr. Brown's death on Dec. 25. Mr. Brown's lawyers contend that Ms Hynie was already married when she married Mr. Brown in 2001, rendering their marriage void. Her previous marriage was annulled, but she and Mr. Brown never held another ceremony, the lawyers said. Mr. Brown's will named only his six adult children as beneficiaries, but it did not cover many of the singer's primary assets, including music rights and his house. Footnotes The first Eagles studio album to appear since 1979, which has been in the works since 2003, will be out ''sometime in the next 60 to 90 days,'' said Don Henley, a member of the group, according to Billboard.com. The album is still untitled. Penélope Cruz, who has been nominated for an Oscar, is to star in a new Woody Allen film, to be shot this summer in Barcelona, El País reported on Friday. Roman Polanski will begin shooting ''Pompeii'' this summer in Italy, a $130 million thriller set in the days leading up to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

The auction business, in particular. Mr. Taubman, 82, pooh-poohed rumors that his recent sale of a controlling stake in Sotheby's means that he might quit the company entirely. (In 2001, a New York jury convicted Mr. Taubman of conspiring with a competitor, Christie's, to fix art-sale commissions. He spent 10 1/2 months in jail.)

2006-09-09	Arts, Briefly; Trove of an Astute Collector	Sotheby's in New York will auction more than 200 objects, including several Andy Warhol paintings, from the estate of David Whitney, the collector and curator who was the longtime companion of the architect Philip Johnson, the auction house said yesterday. Mr. Whitney, who died last year, acquired works by many artists before they became stars, including Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, James Rosenquist and Jasper Johns. He left most of his works, including one of the world's best collections of works on paper by Mr. Johns, to the Menil Collection in Houston, which estimated their value to be at least $8 million. Sotheby's expected that the remaining items -- paintings, furniture, pottery and folk art -- would sell for $3.5 million to $5 million when they are auctioned on Nov. 16. Proceeds will go to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to aid in the maintenance of Johnson's famous Glass House in New Canaan, Conn., which is to open to visitors next year. RANDY KENNEDY
2006-06-21	Arts, Briefly; Amedeo Modigliani Portrait Fetches $30 Million	Impressionist and Modern artworks sold for a total of $163.6 million at Sotheby's in London on Monday night, the highest amount for any auction held in London. The star of the show, consigned from an otherwise unidentified American collection, was a portrait, above, painted by Amedeo Modigliani in 1919, a year before his death. The portrait, said to represent Jeanne Hébuterne, the artist's companion, sold for $30 million, the second-highest price ever paid at auction for a Modigliani. The seller bought the painting at its last auction appearance, at Sotheby's New York in May 1997, for $8.7 million, a figure that seems timid in retrospect, although widely deemed high at the time.

2006-04-27	At Spring Auctions, Big Names Are Selling, and Being Sold	Some of the greatest hits in art history are coming to Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan this weekend: a van Gogh portrait of Madame Ginoux, the proprietress of the Café de la Gare in Arles, France, which the artist frequented until his suicide in 1890; a 1941 Picasso painting of his mistress Dora Maar with a black cat perched on her shoulder, not publicly seen for more than 40 years; and a haunting 1902 Blue Period Picasso of Germaine, one of his earliest muses. Lovers of postwar and contemporary art will have lots to ogle this weekend too: a Warhol soup can with its top cut open; three of Donald Judd's signature wall stacks; Jeff Koons's vacuum cleaners encased in a Plexiglas box; even a lamb submerged in formaldehyde by Damien Hirst. (Phillips, de Pury & Company also has a sale of contemporary art on May 11, filled with newer works by some of today's hot artists.)
2006-04-23	NOBLESSE NO HELP	Nobility may have its privileges, but they do not necessarily extend to the boardroom. The Duke of Devonshire found that out when the independent directors of Sotheby's Holdings ruled that he was not their peer. The duke, who is deputy chairman of Sotheby's, also draws an annual fee of $117,189 as a consultant to the company, its proxy statement shows. This year, he is due to collect an additional $180,290, as well as a share of net revenue, from an exhibition and sale that a Sotheby's subsidiary will hold this year at Chatsworth, his family estate in the English countryside. His employment as a consultant compromised his independence but, the proxy said, ''the Duke of Devonshire may continue to serve on the compensation committee during a transition period lasting through September 6, 2007.''

2006-04-19	Illegal Antiquities Cache Prompts Greek Inquiry	The Greek authorities said on Tuesday that they were investigating a suspected conspiracy to smuggle antiquities hidden on a remote island to major museums and other buyers abroad. The inquiry, described by the Greek culture minister, George Voulgarakis, as ''one of the most complex cases in recent history,'' springs from a raid last week in an Athens suburb and another on Skhoinousa, a tiny Greek island, where the police discovered a vast cache of ancient artifacts, some more than 3,000 years old.
2006-04-07	Inside Art	For Venice Biennale: Felix Gonzalez-Torres Felix Gonzalez-Torres, a Cuban-born American artist who died in 1996, has been chosen to represent the United States at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Mr. Gonzalez-Torres, who died of AIDS at 38, produced graceful Conceptual works with political and personal messages. Using everyday materials -- stacks of replenishable paper to represent the inevitability of death, strings of lights to represent dreams of a better world -- he transformed emotion into evocative installations.
2006-04-01	China: The New Contemporary-Art Frontier	Sitting in the back row among a crowd of 400 people at Sotheby's York Avenue salesroom yesterday morning, a Singapore collector unknown to even the most knowledgeable of experts on Asian art spent nearly $1 million on a dreamy portrait of a dazed-looking comrade. The work, ''Bloodline Series: Comrade No. 120'' (1998), by the Chinese figurative painter Zhang Xiaogang, brought the highest price yesterday at New York's first auction of Asian contemporary art. ''It was a market waiting to happen,'' said Henry Howard-Sneyd, Sotheby's managing director in Asia and Australia, after the first session of the all-day event. ''It was amazing to see bidding from virtually all over the globe.''
2006-03-29	Sotheby's Bets On a Windfall For Chinese Art	A $4 million blue and white Yuan dynasty jar is one of the stars of Sotheby's Asian auctions this week. So is a $1 million lacquer dish made for a 15th-century Chinese emperor. But neither object takes center stage in Sotheby's sun-filled 10th-floor galleries. This year, pride of place goes to a vast two-panel painting of smiling Chinese revolutionaries called ''Great Criticism -- Pop Art.'' Painted last year by an artist named Wang Guangyi, it is expected to fetch $180,000 to $250,000 on Friday in Sotheby's first New York auction of contemporary Asian art.

''I've never had a response to a catalog like this,'' said Michael C. Hughes, a private New York City dealer who specializes in Asian art. He was referring to the catalog for his exhibition of more than 100 pieces of Chinese, Korean and Ryukyuan (Okinawa) lacquer, which opens today at the Ingrao Gallery at 17 East 64th Street (through next Friday).
2006-03-04	Arts, Briefly	James Joyce Manuscript Surfaces A previously unknown six-page James Joyce manuscript has been acquired by Ireland's National Library for $1.39 million. Written in pencil in 1923, the sheets, dealing with the first stage of ''Finnegans Wake,'' were acquired by a British-based private collector and sold by Sotheby's, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. Joyce experts at the library said the sheets included ''crucial elements'' in his initial effort at a new book after ''Ulysses.'' Aongus O'hAonghusa, the director of the library, said the most fascinating aspect of the manuscript was the involvement of Joyce's wife, Nora, and the evidence of a collaborative effort. ''Her handwriting appears on three or four of the sheets,'' he said. ''We know that in the middle part of 1923, his eyesight was particularly bad. He dictated the material, and she scribbled it down. Then at some stage later when his eyesight improved, he went back over it and made changes, particularly spelling changes. But he didn't correct all the spelling; curiously enough, he retained some of her misspellings.'' The purchase of the manuscript was financed by Allied Irish Bank under a special tax credit program, and the bank donated it to the library, home of a major Joyce collection. James Levine Is Still Out James Levine, below, was unable to conduct yesterday afternoon's Boston Symphony Orchestra concert at Symphony Hall in Boston as he continued to recover from an onstage fall there on Wednesday night. A statement yesterday from Mark Volpe, the orchestra's managing director, said Mr. Levine, its music director, ''is experiencing considerable soreness and discomfort in his shoulder.'' Mr. Volpe added: ''As a result, he needs to continue resting from conducting today, and possibly the remainder of the weekend. Mr. Levine is extremely disappointed about his continuing absence from the B.S.O. podium, and sincerely hopes to return as soon as possible.'' Jens Georg Bachmann, assistant conductor, led the orchestra in Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. The program is to be repeated tonight. There was no word on whether Mr. Levine would conduct the orchestra's concert at Carnegie Hall on Monday. Gary Glitter Sentenced Castigated by a judge in Vietnam for ''disgusting and sick'' behavior, the British glam rocker Gary Glitter, 61, was sentenced yesterday to three years in prison for molesting two Vietnamese girls, The Associated Press reported. A star in the 1970's, Glitter, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, was found guilty of committing obscene acts with two girls, 10 and 11, at his rented seaside villa in the southern port city of Vung Tau and at nearby hotels. Although he showed no emotion while the verdict was read, Glitter proclaimed his innocence immediately afterward. ''I haven't done anything,'' he said. ''I'm innocent. It's a conspiracy by you know who.'' He appeared to be referring to British newspapers that tracked him to Vietnam. The court also ordered him to pay $320 to each girl's family, as well as court fees, and the judge said he would be deported to Britain after he served his sentence. He has 15 days to appeal. His lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said he would be eligible for parole in a year. Carnegie Hall to Honor Donor of $20 Million In recognition of a $20 million gift from its trustee Ronald O. Perelman, Carnegie Hall announced yesterday that the stage of its Isaac Stern Auditorium would be named the Ronald O. Perelman Family Stage. The gift benefits Carnegie Hall's education and artistic programs through the establishment of the Ronald O. Perelman Family Music Endowment for elementary and secondary music education. Mr. Perelman, the chairman and chief executive of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, whose interests include Panavision and Revlon, will also produce an annual benefit event at Carnegie Hall. Norman Mailer was given the medal of the Legion of Honor, France's highest distinction, in ceremonies yesterday at the French cultural embassy on the Upper East Side. Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador, said, ''Norman Mailer is an American hero with a fierce love of freedom, and an intellectual who has taken a stand in all the great struggles of his time -- what we call un intellectuel engagé.'' Mr. Mailer, whose books include ''The Naked and the Dead,'' ''The Armies of the Night'' and ''The Executioner's Song,'' was made a commander of the French Order of Arts and Letters in 1983. Leonard Cohen Wins Millions; Can He Collect? The singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, below, has been awarded a $9.5 million default judgment against his former business manager after she failed to respond to charges of stealing from his retirement savings, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Cohen's lawyer, Scott Edelman, said that on Monday a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles granted the judgment against the manager, Kelley Lynch. Mr. Cohen, 71, said in his lawsuit that Ms. Lynch had siphoned $5 million from his personal accounts and investment, leaving him with about $150,000. Whether Mr. Cohen collects the judgment is another matter. Mr. Edelman said of Ms. Lynch: ''She's hard to get in touch with. I don't know where she lives now, and I don't have a phone number for her.'' She could not be reached for comment. Grodin to Grodin's Rescue If figurative calls of ''Author! Author!'' resounded through the 59E59 Theaters on Thursday, they were less a sign of acclaim than a cry for help. A leading actor in the Primary Stages production of the Charles Grodin play ''The Right Kind of People'' had been taken ill. What to do? The answer: Recruit the playwright in his place. So Mr. Grodin, who had not acted onstage since 1975, when he appeared in ''Same Time, Next Year,'' soon found himself signing an Equity contract and standing before an audience, script in hand, in his comedy about the members of the co-op board of a Fifth Avenue apartment building. He was to repeat his performance last night and was standing by, if needed, to appear in today's matinee. The show closes tomorrow afternoon. New Springsteen Album Is Homage to Pete Seeger Bruce Springsteen will release his 21st album, ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' on April 25. The album, on Columbia, features interpretations of 13 songs associated with the folk legend Pete Seeger. Pearl Jam will release its first album in three and a half years on May 2, Reuters reported. The J Records recording, ''Pearl Jam,'' will be preceded by a single, ''World Wide Suicide,'' to be released to rock radio outlets in the United States on Wednesday.
2006-02-26	Hey Mamaroneck, Recognize This Pond?	''NOTHING paintable,'' is how Edward Steichen succinctly described the coastal wetlands around Mamaroneck in a letter to his friend Alfred Stieglitz, dated Aug. 7, 1904. After the birth of a daughter, Steichen and his first wife, Clara, had accepted an invitation to spend summer at the Westchester home of Charles H. Caffin, an art critic. The birth had been difficult, and Steichen thought his wife might appreciate somewhere peaceful to recuperate.
2006-02-20	William Blake and 'The Grave'	In 1805, William Blake, the poet and artist, was hired to engrave a series of 20 of his own watercolor illustrations for Robert Blair's poem ''The Grave.'' This was an important opportunity for Blake. ''What is Good must Succeed first or last,'' he wrote to a friend. Blake has indeed succeeded -- he looms large in our understanding of the artist's imagination -- but the commission for ''The Grave'' was doomed. The publisher hired another engraver in Blake's place. The original watercolors more or less vanished until 2001, when 19 were discovered as a group in a Glasgow bookshop. A tangled tale ensued. And now for the unhappy final chapter. They are to be broken up and sold at auction at Sotheby's. The history of collecting is littered with the leaves of books and manuscripts that were taken apart and sold page by page. It is almost always a practice with only one justification -- maximizing profit. To literary scholars and art historians, it is maddening, if only because it scatters the elements of a coherent collection or a complete book.
2006-02-19	Mind Over Splatter	LAST year, 24 paintings were unveiled as previously unknown works by Jackson Pollock. Authenticated by one of the world's most respected authorities on Pollock's work, the paintings were to go on exhibition this year, the 50th anniversary of the artist's death. But Richard Taylor, a physics professor retained by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation to subject six of the paintings to computer-assisted analysis, discovered that the paintings may well be fakes -- at least, the drips lack Pollock's characteristic geometric pattern. The collection's owner disputes that this finding is conclusive.
2006-02-17	Inside Art	An Expensive Coming Out For One of Picasso's Ladies Sotheby's and Christie's are bracing for the war of the $50 million women. At their evening auctions of Impressionist and modern art in May, both companies are selling historically important portraits: at Christie's, an 1890 van Gogh image of Madame Ginoux, the proprietress of the Café de la Gare in Arles, France, which the artist frequented, and at Sotheby's, a seminal 1941 Picasso portrait of his mistress Dora Maar that has not been seen in public for more than 40 years. Christie's announced the sale of its van Gogh in January. This week Sotheby's countered with the Picasso. ''Dora Maar With Cat'' is a large canvas -- 50 1/2 inches by 37 1/2 inches -- that depicts the subject seated in a large wooden chair with a black cat perched at her shoulder.
2006-02-17	A Big Sale Spurs Talk of a Photography Gold Rush	Photography has had ''it'' moments before -- times when the comfortingly concrete facts of the marketplace signaled to curators, dealers and photographers that the medium had finally arrived, fully embraced by the world of fine art and serious collecting. In 1981, a huge print of Ansel Adams's famous ''Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico'' sold in Los Angeles for $71,500 -- at the time the highest price ever paid for a photograph, and an even more stunning figure because Adams was still alive at the time.
2006-02-16	Art Experts Protest Sale Of Rare Set Of Blakes	The discovery was pure serendipity: nosing around in a dusty bookshop in Scotland on a spring day five years ago, a pair of British booksellers stumbled upon a weathered red leather case engraved with the words ''Designs for Blair's Grave.'' Opening it, they found 19 Romantic yet macabre watercolors -- depicting angels, sarcophagi, moonlit graveyards, arm-linked spirits -- rendered in a subtle range of grays, black and pastels. Five years, one lawsuit and an export battle later, the watercolors -- illustrations created in 1805 by the poet and artist William Blake for a 1743 poem -- are being heralded by scholars as the most important Blake discovery in a century.
2006-02-04	Chinese Collectors Resist Investing in Western Art	As with many mansions and luxury apartments of the emerging commercial elite across China, Linus W. L. Cheung's elegant home overlooking Victoria Harbor here is almost entirely decorated with Chinese art. A large, very heavy abstract bronze by Zhu Ming, a living Taiwanese sculptor, stands in the living room in front of a plate-glass wall with breathtaking views of the city skyline below. Two lovely scrolls by Qi Baishi, a mainland Chinese painter who died in 1957, are suspended at the entrance to the room. In the master bedroom, near another sweeping view of the city, hangs a large canvas in somber shades of blue by Lin Fengmian, a Chinese painter who died in 1991.
2006-01-28	At Sotheby's: Still Lifes, Landscapes, Stony Faces	Everyone who was there agreed: Thursday afternoon's auction at Sotheby's was a bold attempt to turn the arcane world of an old-masters auction into a cash-and-carry event. The goal was to attract the retail customer rather than the dealer. George Wachter, director of Sotheby's old-masters paintings department worldwide put together the sale and called it ''The Dealer's Eye,'' offering 73 paintings, drawings, watercolors and decorative objects culled from dealers' stock worldwide. The idea was that there would be no secrets and no gambles: buyers were furnished with a complete history of each work, including the seller, and each work was ready to be hung, saving the buyer the expense of cleaning, restoring and framing.
2006-01-27	A Storied Rembrandt Goes to a Mystery Bidder	A mysterious collector went on a Dutch buying spree yesterday at Sotheby's, paying $4.27 million for a much-watched Rembrandt portrait and another $1.87 million for a Jan Steen and a Gerrit Dou. The bidder, identified only as a New York collector and Paddle No. LO179, snapped up the works in the first hour of the old master paintings sale, starting with Rembrandt's ''Study of an Elderly Woman in a White Cap,'' from around 1640. The buyer edged out four other bidders for the portrait, which was reauthenticated as a Rembrandt only recently after a restoration in Amsterdam.
2006-01-20	Antiques	18th-Century Americana From a Singular House An important auction of Americana -- nearly 200 lots of furniture and decorative arts collected by Diane and Norman Bernstein of Washington -- is to be held on Sunday at Sotheby's in New York. One notable aspect of the sale of the contents of their house is that most of the antiques come from one dealer. The Bernsteins did not always buy their antiques from just one shop. But beginning in 1983, when they bought the historic mansion known as the Lindens, they made their most serious purchases of Americana at the Israel Sack gallery in New York, which closed in 2001.
2006-01-13	Antiques	The Bustling Season Of American Art And English Pottery Today marks the beginning of Americana madness in Manhattan, two lively weeks of auctions, fairs, lectures and preview parties dedicated to 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century American furniture, paintings, folk art and decorative arts. Collectors, curators, scholars and dealers are flooding the city. The auction previews begin at Sotheby's today and at Christie's tomorrow; the fairs start next week. The four-day American Antiques Show at the Metropolitan Pavilion, 125 West 18th Street, with 43 dealers who specialize in American antiques, folk art and pictures, opens with a benefit for the American Folk Art Museum on Wednesday night. It will be open to the public from Thursday through Jan. 22.
2006-01-13	Inside Art	Going to Auction: Pieces of History In the second half of the 19th century, plaster casts of important European artworks were a fashionable teaching tool in museums and schools. Institutions like the Metropolitan Museum formed collections that included plaster replicas of architectural elements like the pediments of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, reliefs from the Parthenon and casts of Italian Renaissance art like Della Robbia's relief of a Virgin with saints. The first casts were exhibited at the museum in 1889. Over the years, as times and tastes have changed, the Met has given hundreds of these casts to places like the Art Students League of New York, the National Taipei Teachers College and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
2005-10-30	A Presale Showing of a Rembrandt	Often, important paintings are displayed only for two or three days preceding their sale at auction. But visitors to Amsterdam who want the opportunity to see ''Lighting Study of an Elderly Woman in a White Cap,'' right, which is to be sold at Sotheby's in January but was only recently attributed to Rembrandt, can see it at the Rembrandt House Museum until Dec. 4. The small exhibit, ''Unknown Paintings by Rembrandt,'' includes three other paintings that experts have recently determined are Rembrandts, along with photographs of the paintings for which they were studies. The best known was said to be a study for ''Christ and the Woman Taken in Adversity.''
2005-10-28	Antiques	An Elegant Collection With Worldwide Scope The viewing rooms at Sotheby's on York Avenue look like Buckingham Palace today, and will continue to do so through Wednesday. They have been lavishly decorated with carved and gilded French and British antiques, Chinese celadon, oil paintings, Aubusson carpets and other works of art for the viewing of some of the treasures from Lily and Edmond J. Safra's residences in London, Geneva, Paris and New York.
2005-10-28	Inside Art	From 'Not Interested' To a Collaboration Officials at the Pompidou Center in Paris are eating their words. When it became known last year that both the Pompidou Center and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation were interested in building a museum in Hong Kong as part of a 100-acre development project called the West Kowloon Cultural District, Bruno Racine, president of the Pompidou, was quoted in The South China Morning Post as saying: ''We and the Guggenheim have different concepts. We're not interested in managing a museum together with the Guggenheim.'' The Pompidou's director, Alfred Pacquement, went one step further; The Post quoted him as saying, ''A museum is not a Coca-Cola factory; you can't have museum branches everywhere in the world.''
2005-10-27	Noted Collections Bolster Christie's Fall Sales	Rarely do three well-known art collections come to the auction block in the same season. Even more rarely does one auction house get to sell them all. Starting Tuesday, Christie's will offer several exceptional works, including a Toulouse-Lautrec painting of a red-haired model, one of the centerpieces of the recent exhibition ''Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre'' at the Art Institute of Chicago; a 1954 Rothko inspired by Matisse's 1911 ''Red Studio''; and an abstract de Kooning from 1977 that has had only one owner: the artist's lawyer, Lee V. Eastman.
2005-10-21	Inside Art	A $1 Million-Plus Tankard For the Met, or Maybe Not In May, Sotheby's held a much-touted English country house sale of property from Easton Neston, the stately English Renaissance home built by Nicholas Hawksmoor in Northamptonshire, 72 miles northwest of London. Lord Hesketh, the chairman of British Mediterranean Airways and chairman of the Conservative Party, said he had to part with his home, the seat of the Fermor and Hesketh families for four centuries, because the cost of maintaining the house and grounds had become prohibitive and he wanted to provide for his family in the future.
2005-10-13	A Historic Discovery, in Beethoven's Own Hand	Heather Carbo, a matter-of-fact librarian at an evangelical seminary outside Philadelphia, was cleaning out an archival cabinet one hot afternoon in July. It was a dirty and routine job. But there, on the bottom shelf, she stumbled across what may be one of the most important musicological finds in years. It was a working manuscript score for a piano version of Beethoven's ''Grosse Fuge,'' a monument of classical music. And it was in the composer's own hand, according to Sotheby's auction house. The 80-page manuscript in mainly brown ink -- a furious scattering of notes across the page, with many changes and cross-outs, some so deep that the paper is punctured -- dates from the final months of Beethoven's life.
2005-10-07	Antiques	A Noble Family's German Castle Empties Its Attic for Sotheby's The New York art world may be obsessed with Russia this fall, but others are thinking about Germany. This month some outstanding examples of German taste and culture can be seen in a multiday house sale in a castle belonging to one of the oldest noble families in Germany.
2005-09-22	The Case of the Servant With the Fur Collar	Why was she wearing fur? That was one of the first questions experts asked when they began studying a 17th-century portrait of a woman who had the unmistakably stolid face of a servant but was decked out in a sumptuous fur collar. And why did the light on her face appear to be reflected off the dark surface of that collar when it should be absorbed by it?
2005-09-16	Antiques	Taking Russian Art To the Motherland Art follows money. For the second time in two years Yves Bouvier, owner of the Geneva fair organizer ArtCultureStudio, is mounting the Moscow World Fine Art Fair, which runs Tuesday through Sept. 26. In June 2004 he lured about 25 dealers to Moscow. This year, he said, 70 will be at the fair, which will be in a 19th-century neo-Classical building, the Manège.
2005-09-09	Archaeologists and Dealers Spar Over U.S.-Italian Art Accord	Lawyers representing art dealers and Sotheby's auction house sparred with archaeologists and cultural property experts on Thursday at a State Department committee hearing on the future of a sweeping agreement banning the import of antiquities from Italy. Known formally as a memorandum of understanding, the five-year-old agreement is intended to reduce the flow of illicitly excavated Italian antiquities to the United States in return for heightened cultural cooperation between the Italian government and American arts institutions.
2005-07-29	Inside Art	The Met Is to Auction Some of Its Photographs Highlights from a photography sale at Sotheby's on Feb. 14 and 15 read like a Who's Who of the medium's earliest masters: Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Outerbridge and Edward Weston. Just as intriguing is the provenance: the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Why is the Met selling such prized images?
2005-07-22	Inside Art	At Morgan Library, Many New Treats By the time the Pierpont Morgan Library reopens next spring after a $102 million renovation and expansion, its collection will be greatly enriched through both gifts and purchases. ''It's an enormous range,'' said Charles E. Pierce Jr., the Morgan's director, describing recent acquisitions. ''Some are the result of longtime relationships; others are short-term surprises.''
2005-05-27	Inside Art	Getting a Better Look At a Young Lucian Freud A haunting self-portrait of Lucian Freud with oversized ears and awkwardly crossed arms, painted in 1943 when the artist was just 21, is one of the more intriguing works coming up for sale in London in June. Mr. Freud's ''Man With a Feather (Self-Portrait)'' comes to the auction market just as prices for his works are at an all-time high. At Christie's in London in February, ''Red Haired Man on a Chair'' (1962-63) sold for $7.7 million, a record for the artist. In addition to a spate of retrospectives in recent years, there will be an exhibition of about 80 of his works at the Museo Correr in Venice, opening June 11 to coincide with the Biennale.
2005-05-24	Arts, Briefly; Balfour Declaration To Be Auctioned	What Sotheby's is calling the only known surviving autographed draft of the Balfour Declaration, the 1917 document below that called for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in what was then Palestine, along with other documents from the archive of the Zionist Leader Leon Simon is to be auctioned in New York on June 16. Besides two original drafts of the Declaration, the auction includes a signed letter from Chaim Weizmann, a Zionist and chemist who relocated from Germany to Britain after the start of World War I, asking his colleagues to review the draft. Sotheby's expects the archive to sell for $500,000 to $800,000. CAROL VOGEL
2005-05-18	Civic Treasure: A Need for Transparency, Not Secrecy	In the early 1970's the Metropolitan Museum privately sold off works by van Gogh and Henri Rousseau, among others. It caused a scandal. The New York attorney general stepped in. Twenty years later, the Guggenheim, which had been selling off Kandinskys by the dozens, caused a ruckus when it disposed of a Chagall, a Modigliani and a Kandinsky at an auction that finally caught the public's attention. Lately, without nearly enough public accountability, the Museum of Modern Art has become a regular Kwik-E-Mart of art sales. It has turned over, among much else, an early Francis Bacon to a London dealer and a Cubist view by Picasso of the Spanish town of Horta de Ebro, a rare picture that originally belonged to Gertrude Stein. The newly expanded Modern said it no longer needed it because it was getting another, better view of Horta de Ebro from David Rockefeller.

Takashi Hashiyama, president of Maspro Denkoh Corporation, an electronics company based outside of Nagoya, Japan, could not decide whether Christie's or Sotheby's should sell the company's art collection, which is worth more than $20 million, at next week's auctions in New York.
2005-04-29	Inside Art	A Silent Auction For Library's Art Sotheby's is planning a silent auction with sealed bids for one of the most famous images in American art: Asher B. Durand's ''Kindred Spirits.''
2005-04-28	At Auction, Snapshots Of a Market	Collectors poring over this spring's auction catalogs will readily spot the signs of today's tastes and fashions. There are instantly recognizable images, like one of Warhol's paintings of Elizabeth Taylor, one of Rothko's moody abstract canvases and a recently discovered Brancusi sculpture from the artist's ''Bird in Space'' series. Many hot current art stars are represented too, with works by Marlene Dumas, Maurizio Cattelan, Elizabeth Peyton, Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. A decade ago the big money was primarily to be found in Impressionist and modern art. But during the next two weeks of back-to-back evening auctions, newer art is expected to be where hungry buyers will gravitate. Fueled in large part by a passionate group of multimillionaire hedge-fund managers, with deep pockets and a taste for the 20th and 21st centuries, they relish the competition of bidding at auction and will often pay whatever it takes to bring home the best.
2005-04-11	New York Public Library to Sell Major Artworks to Raise Funds	The New York Public Library has decided to sell 19 works of art from its collection -- including ''Kindred Spirits,'' a widely admired landscape by the Hudson River School painter Asher B. Durand, and two seminal portraits of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart -- so that it can better compete in acquisitions of important books and collections. Sotheby's, which has been retained by the library, estimates that the works will sell for $50 million to $75 million. The transactions will be handled either privately or by public auction. Paul LeClerc, the library's president, said all of the money would go toward buying books, manuscripts and other works on paper and toward bolstering the library's endowment.
2005-04-05	BOLDFACE	Here We Were Thinking The Future Was in Ferrets For a while now, we've stopped paying attention to whether TINKERBELL, PARIS HILTON's accessory Chihuahua, was lost or found or had been accidentally posted on the Internet. We have begun to sense that the whole dog accessory trend has, so to speak, gone to the really nice farm in the country, where it will be much happier. After all, knitting has been reported as the latest trend, and carrying live animals and foot-long needles in the same purse could be quite unpleasant. So on our lookout for the Next Grating Little Thing, we went to Sotheby's last week, where LULU ''I'm not a beer heiress'' GUINNESS was auctioning off some of her handbags.
2005-03-25	Antiques	Heroic Commanders, Heroically Depicted If you think about how wartime presidents in the United States admire Gilbert Stuart's portraits of George Washington, you may understand how Emperor Qianlong of China (1736-98) valued portraits of his own military leaders. In its ''Chinese Works of Art'' sale Thursday and next Friday, Sotheby's is to offer a set of paintings of 10 heroic commanders attributed to the Chinese court painter Jin Tingbiao (active 1757-67). Qianlong commissioned them for his personal use and wrote a eulogy for each commander.
2005-03-11	Inside Art	Selling a Half Of 2 Kandinskys Artists working in the early years of the 20th century occasionally painted on two sides of a thick sheet of fiberboard because it was cheaper and more resilient than canvas. Sometimes they kept these double-sided paintings intact -- but they might slice the fiberboard down the middle as a way of getting two paintings for the price of one piece of fiberboard.
2005-03-10	Clubby Finds, From a Gramercy Moment	This afternoon, Sotheby's is selling 31 pieces of Hollywood high-style furniture from the Cobalt Club, a celebrity hangout at the Gramercy Park Hotel that lasted about eight months in 2003, despite attracting customers like Ethan Hawke, Sofia Coppola and Zac Posen. The marble or glass tables, upholstered seats and iron shelves are mostly French. A sinuous 1940's sofa (above, estimated at $6,000 to $8,000), from the women's restroom, was once Karl Lagerfeld's. Metal vines wind around a 1940's étagère ($3,000 to $4,000) that was a partition at the club. ''It was a very seductive, short-lived environment,'' said Steven Greenberg, a former owner of the hotel. The hotel, with Ian Schrager as an owner, is being gutted for condos and a smaller hotel, with minimalist interiors by John Pawson. EVE M. KAHN
2005-03-04	Inside Art	An Intimate View Of Diane Arbus Since the photographer Diane Arbus committed suicide in 1971 at 48, her life has inspired an almost macabre fascination. ''Diane Arbus Revelations,'' the traveling exhibition that arrives at the Metropolitan Museum on Tuesday, gives visitors a peek beyond the images for which she is so well known.
2005-03-04	An Early Believer In 20th-Century Design	When the British founded the Arts and Crafts movement in the 1860's, one of the founders' goals was to persuade the public to give the decorative arts the same due as fine arts. They may not have totally succeeded but such efforts continue. ''I think the creations of major 20th-century architects are at the same artistic and cultural level as works by Picasso, though there is a total lack of proportion in the prices their designs fetch compared with modern paintings,'' Torsten Bröhan, an authority on modern design, said in an interview by phone from Germany. ''Prices always reflect society's knowledge and appreciation. It's harder for the public to learn about the pioneers of design. I see the need to increase this knowledge.''
2005-02-16	Another Kennedy Auction Brings Out Nostalgia and Wallets	An Italian ship owner spent $96,000 at Sotheby's yesterday for a 20th-century rocking chair once used by President John F. Kennedy. If the price sounds astronomical, it seemed like a bargain to those who were at the York Avenue auction house when another Kennedy rocker brought $442,500 nine years ago. The rocker -- and household objects like chipped china, used table linens, old records and well-worn furniture from various Kennedy family homes in Hyannis Port and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., as well as New Jersey, New York and Virginia -- are being auctioned over three days this week. It's Caroline Kennedy's version of a garage sale.
2005-02-04	Inside Art	From Versace's Home To Sotheby's House Sotheby's seems to have a monopoly on celebrity auctions this season. This month it is holding a kind of tag sale for Caroline Kennedy, disposing of the contents of her mother's many homes -- everything from chipped china to well-worn upholstery.
2005-01-30	Church Brings In $660,000 From Sale of Silver	Selling the so-called family silver has become something of a trend among New England churches seeking to make capital improvements, and that includes the First Church of Christ, Congregational 1652, at 75 Main Street in Farmington, which auctioned seven pieces of its antique silver at Sotheby's on Jan. 21. Five antique silver drinking cups were sold for $660,000. Two more cups offered as a pair did not sell, but considering that the congregants of the church found out only two years ago that the cups were valuable and fodder for an auction, it was all found money to them.
2005-01-28	Inside Art	A Happy Source of Riches In a Pair of Scowling Busts An 18th-century lead bust of a grimacing man by the Austrian court sculptor Franz XaverMesserschmidt was bought by the Louvre for $4.8 million at Sotheby's yesterday, an auction record for sculpture of that period.
2005-01-26	Arts, Briefly	Psalter Saved for Britain With two weeks remaining before the Getty Museum in Los Angeles would have acquired the medieval manuscript known as the Macclesfield Psalter, the British public and various British funds and foundations have raised some $3.2 million to secure the manuscript for the Fitzwilliam Museum, the art museum of Cambridge University. With many humorous marginal depictions, the psalter, dating to the 1320's, consists of 252 richly illustrated pages regarded as including some of the most remarkable examples of English painting before Constable and Turner. An announcement from the National Art Collections Fund, an independent charity that began the campaign to raise the money, said, ''The Fitzwilliam has now made a matching offer to the owner, and the Getty has gracefully withdrawn its interest.'' The psalter, from the libraries of the earls of Macclesfield, was sold to the Getty in June by Sotheby's in London, but the British government's export review system gave the Fitzwilliam the chance to match the sale price. Footnotes The 10-day 34th International Film Festival Rotterdam, opening today in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will show three films by Theo van Gogh, the Dutch filmmaker slain in apparent reprisal for his documentary ''Submission,'' about the mistreatment of Muslim women, Agence France-Presse reported. Tight security is planned when it is shown at the festival, which focuses on dependent, creative and experimental filmmaking. Michael Imperioli, right, the Emmy Award-winning actor best known for his performances as Christopher Moltisanti on ''The Sopranos,'' will direct a cast led by the Emmy Award-winning Julianna Margulies (Nurse Carol Hathaway on ''E.R.'') and Michael Rispoli (Jackie Aprile of ''The Sopranos'') in ''Late Fragment,'' a new play by Francine Volpe. The play, about a man who miraculously survives the destruction of the World Trade Center and returns home to his wife to learn that his life was not all that he thought it was, will run from Feb. 9 through 17 at the Studio Dante, the theater that Mr. Imperioli and his wife, Victoria, operate at 257 West 29th Street.
2005-01-21	Antiques	Family Furniture, From Way Back Cotton Mather, the 17th-century Puritan minister in Boston, called the colonial settlement of Newport, R.I., ''a sewer of religious contagion'' because Newport was accepting such Puritan outcasts as Baptists, Quakers, Anglicans, Jews and Unitarians. Pieter Nicholson Roos, executive director of the Newport Restoration Foundation, speaking at a seminar on Rhode Island furniture last week at Sotheby's, said such open-mindedness may have contributed to Newport's economic boom of the early 1700's.
2005-01-07	Inside Art	Venetian Views Offered In Old Master Auction Each January, European dealers in old masters descend on New York for the twice-yearly sales of paintings at Sotheby's and Christie's. As always, timing is everything. These auctions are particularly important because dealers from art capitals like London and Paris hope to make discoveries or snap up bargains that they can restore in time for the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in early March.
2004-12-17	Inside Art	A New Curator for the Tate Will Be Based in New York Marla Prather, formerly head of postwar art at the Whitney Museum of American Art and 20th-century art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, has been named curator of American art at the Tate in London. But Ms. Prather will be based in New York. ''We have had curators based in London who have been interested in American art,'' said Sir Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director, ''but it became increasingly clear that it would be helpful to have someone in New York.''
2004-12-14	Arts, Briefly; Rachmaninoff Score Unsold	Sotheby's in London pulled a manuscript of Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony off the auction block last week after a last-minute claim by the composer's estate. The auction house confirmed that the family was disputing the ownership of the autographed manuscript, presumed lost since its completion in 1908. According to news reports in sources including The St. Petersburg Times, Alexandre Rachmaninoff, a grandson of the composer, stopped the sale with a court injunction. The 320-page manuscript had been expected to bring $550,000 to $920,000. SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY
2004-12-12	So, Caroline Kennedy Couldn't Hold a Yard Sale?	Remember all those tantalizing Kennedy hideaways? Those storied homes that had touch football and Boston accents thick as good clam chowder? Hyannis Port, Martha's Vineyard, Peapack. Peapack? Yes, Peapack. Jacqueline Kennedy started spending time in Somerset County with her children and other family members in 1965. Ms. Kennedy, who married Aristotle Onassis in 1968, bought a converted barn in Peapack, where she indulged her love of horses and fox hunting. Many Thanksgivings and birthdays were celebrated there until the 1990's. Ms. Onassis died in 1994.
2004-12-10	A Warehouse-Size Tag Sale For Some Big Names Of 20th-Century Design	Why is Barry Friedman selling more than 200 pieces of furniture and art glass at Sotheby's next Friday? Mr. Friedman, a Manhattan dealer specializing in 20th-century European decorative arts, photography, avant-garde paintings and art glass, has been a trendsetter since he started as a dealer in 1967. He introduced the Vienna Secession and mid-20th-century French furniture to a new generation. He has mounted at least 15 exhibitions with catalogs, including ''Mackintosh to Mollino: 50 Years of Chair Design'' in 1984. He has had shows on the Bauhaus, Gerrit Rietveld and the painters Fernand Khnopff and Tamara de Lempicka.
2004-12-09	At Sotheby's, a Rare Sale Of Mission Furniture	On Dec. 17, Sotheby's will auction 50 pieces of furniture by the architects Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene, brothers whose firm in Pasadena, Calif., produced dozens of Craftsman-style houses in the early 1900's. Their furniture rarely comes to market, because there is so little of it: the Greenes were obsessive and notoriously slow, meticulously supervising artisans as they inlaid woodwork with semiprecious stones or cut squiggly colored panes for light fixtures. The Sotheby's consignor, an elderly collector on the West Coast, got many of the objects from heirs of the Greenes or of their clients. Estimates range from $300 to $400 for an iron teapot, and from $100,000 to $150,000 for a lantern in mahogany and leaded glass, above. EVE KAHN
2004-12-05	The Nation; It's Not Junk if It Was Jackie's	AGAIN banking on the mystique of provenance, Sotheby's announced last week that it would hold another Kennedy tag sale in February. In 1996, the Kennedy housecleaning, then proclaimed ''the sale of the century'' by auction hypsters and aptly lampooned on ''Seinfeld,'' fetched $34.5 million for 1,300 lots. The items sold included President John F. Kennedy's golf clubs (split into two lots; combined price: $1.16 million) and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's fake pearls ($211,500). This sequel will feature 600 more items scavenged by Caroline Kennedy from her family's attics -- Mason jars, wicker baskets, monogrammed horse blankets, duck decoys, a fiberglass kitchen tray, some art, including a Khmer sculpture, a chaise lounge and dinged tables. Lowballing the total estimate at around $1 million, Sotheby's is obviously hoping to cause another outbreak of the Camelot-by-proxy flu.
2004-12-01	A Kennedy Plans a Tag Sale, So Sotheby's Expects a Crowd	Caroline Kennedy is having another tag sale -- or rather, Sotheby's is having one for her. The auction house announced yesterday that it would sell some of the contents from the Kennedy house in Hyannis Port, Mass., as well as from family homes in New York, New Jersey and Virginia and on Martha's Vineyard. The sale will take place next February, roughly nine years after Ms. Kennedy and her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., consigned part of the estate of their mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, to Sotheby's. That auction, known in some quarters as the ''sale of the century,'' fetched $34.5 million, seven times what the auctioneers had estimated.
2004-11-27	Diamond Lore Is Forever. Just Ask the Auctioneer.	Lot 140 was majestically displayed in a clear case at Sotheby's auction house on the Upper East Side. Aficionados viewing the legendary artifact seemed hypnotized as it turned slowly on a rotating display stand under bright lights. Imposing guards with dark suits scoured the crowd. Maybe they were looking for cleanup hitters: Lot 140 is the 46-ounce, 36-inch Louisville Slugger that Babe Ruth used to hit the first home run at the new Yankee Stadium on April 18, 1923.
2004-11-26	Inside Art	The Frick Acquires A Chinard Bust The Frick Collection has made its first purchase in eight years: an early 19th-century terra-cotta bust by the French sculptor Joseph Chinard. ''Chinard is an artist I've admired for a long time,'' said Anne L. Poulet, director of the Frick. While she was running the department of decorative arts and sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, she acquired three of his works.
2004-11-21	The Castro Collection	RESTING on a coffee table in Jose Fanjul's mansion on Jungle Road is an inscribed silver box, a gift from King Juan Carlos of Spain. Another table bears a silver-framed wedding photo of Mr. Fanjul and his bride greeting the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere in the house, silver-rimmed photos of Mr. Fanjul and Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush are displayed prominently. An Impressionist work by the Spanish artist Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida, ''Girl in the Silvery Sea,'' hangs in a living room corner. Mr. Fanjul opened a thick album and showed a visitor faded snapshots of cavernous estates that he and his extended family once occupied in and around Havana. Fidel Castro, after seizing the Fanjul family's real estate and sugar holdings in 1960, made one of their ornate residences his own.
2004-11-21	Flawlessness Isn't Everything	THE fickle index finger of fashion may be most popularly identified with the spectacles that take place twice a year in New York, Milan and Paris. But for a truer model of the favor-of-the-month -- the crushing wheel that decrees who and what is in or out -- the contemporary-art auctions at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips have no peer. A taste of the latest standings: Maurizio Cattelan, Dan Flavin and Richard Prince are up; Donald Judd and Gerhard Richter are down. It gets rough out there on the auction floor, and no one is more aware of that fact than Tobias Meyer, Sotheby's principal auctioneer.
2004-11-18	On 38th Floor, A $9 Million Sample Sale	WITH polished mahogany paneling, Tiffany lamps and portraits of American Indians and Indian maharajahs, Pierre Bergé's 38th-floor apartment in the Pierre hotel is a sumptuously furnished pied-à-terre in the sky. It might also be the most underused luxury apartment in Manhattan. Mr. Bergé, 74, the fashion mogul and co-founder of Yves Saint Laurent's haute couture empire, rarely visits New York from his home in Paris anymore. That is why, after 26 years, he is selling the five-room apartment (asking price: $9 million; monthly maintenance fee: $12,000) and almost all of its eclectic contents.
2004-11-06	Some High Prices and Low Points in Sotheby's Sale	Big estimates don't necessarily mean big prices, as the art world learned at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art on Thursday night. While nobody at the auction house would admit it, the evening probably cost the company a lot of money. Many works may have fallen short of Sotheby's expectations, but several records were set. The sale was too ambitious. Fierce competition between the auction giants, Sotheby's and Christie's, to obtain good property meant Sotheby's gave many sellers guarantees, meaning it promised them undisclosed minimum sums regardless of the outcome of bidding. In turn, Sotheby's experts were forced to put hefty estimates on many guaranteed works, hoping for a profit.
2004-11-05	Some High Prices and Some Low Points in Auction at Sotheby's	Big estimates don't necessarily mean big prices. That was the lesson the art world learned at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art last night. While nobody at the auction house would admit it, the evening probably cost the company a lot of money. But while many works may have fallen short of the auction house's expectations, there were still several high, record-breaking prices. The sale was overly ambitious. Fierce competition between auction giants Sotheby's and Christie's to get good property meant Sotheby's ended up giving many of last night's sellers guarantees, meaning the auction house promised them an undisclosed minimum sum regardless of the outcome of the sale. That meant that in turn Sotheby's experts were forced to put hefty estimates on many of guaranteed works, in the hopes of turning a profit.
2004-11-01	High Quality, High Stakes At Fall Art Auctions	Savvy auction sellers -- the ones who demanded money up front from Sotheby's and Christie's -- should be laughing all the way to the bank. But in the rest of the art world, the next two weeks will be particularly stressful as Impressionist, modern and contemporary art valued at more than half a billion dollars goes on the market in the important fall sales. This season's splashy auction catalogs are packed with high-priced paintings, drawings and sculptures: one of Monet's famous images of the Houses of Parliament in London, a Gauguin from the artist's Tahitian period, the first painting in Mondrian's legendary ''Boogie-Woogie'' series, early photographs by Richard Prince and Cindy Sherman. Total estimates for sales are higher than they have been since May 1990, the last big auction season before the art market crashed six months later.
2004-11-01	Arts, Briefly; Good Things, Small Packages	A fund-raising sale in London is aiming big by thinking small. Tomorrow night at Sotheby's in London, the charitable will get the chance to buy original leather-bound miniature books by some of the world's greatest statesmen, artists and writers. Approached by a charity for the homeless, Geordie Greig, editor of the glossy magazine Tatler, came up with the idea of asking 25 famous people to fill these tiny books with words or pictures. Among the contributors are Bill Clinton, David Hockney, J.K. Rowling, John le Carré, Harold Pinter, Madonna, left, Paul McCartney and Muhammad Ali. Ms. Rowling returned her book filled with descriptions and drawings of the items Harry Potter needs for wizardry; Margaret Thatcher wrote out her famous speech including the lines ''You turn if you want to: the lady's not for turning''; Harold Pinter wrote a love poem; and Madonna and Sir Paul both did drawings to match lyrics from their songs.

2004-10-30	Arts, Briefly; Wilde in the 21st Century	The 150th birthday of the Irish writer Oscar Wilde on Oct. 16 passed relatively unnoticed in his homeland, but in his adopted city, London, Sotheby's celebrated by putting more than 100 artifacts related to him on the block. The sale total of nearly $1.6 million for the collection -- of rare books, first editions, annotated texts, letters, prints and photographs -- exceeded the auction house's expectations by about 50 percent. A 19-page manuscript copy, above, of a chapter from the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' with the author's revisions from 1890 in elegant longhand, sold for $132,300. And a copy of his first play, ''Vera,'' used by Wilde in rehearsals for its American debut at the Union Square Theater in New York in 1883, fetched $92,000. That is a sharp turnaround from 1907, when, after Wilde's imprisonment for homosexuality, and his death in bankruptcy and disgrace, Sotheby's sold the very same copy for £26. BRIAN LAVERY

2004-10-22	Auctioning Treasures From a Hallmark Of Domestic Elegance	Before his death last year, the Italian industrialist Giovanni Agnelli inaugurated a new museum, the Gianni and Marella Foundation at the Pinacoteca del Lingotto, in a former Fiat factory in Turin, Italy. The Agnellis donated more than 20 paintings, including a few Matisses, two Picassos, a Renoir, six Canalettos and a Modigliani. ''Every single one is a masterpiece,'' Pierre Rosenberg, former chief curator of the Louvre, wrote in the introduction to the new museum's catalog. ''Gianni Agnelli's intentions were clear. The point was to offer pleasure, beauty and joy to his fellow citizens.''
2004-10-08	Inside Art	A Tahitian-Period Gauguin May Bring $50 Million Sotheby's Nov. 4 sale of Impressionist and Modern art has a pricey roster of paintings. The most expensive is a Gauguin from his Tahitian period, which Sotheby's expects to bring $40 million to $50 million. Ever since art experts heard that the painting was to be auctioned, there has been considerable speculation about its condition, its seller and its history.
2004-10-03	Artworks Rushed to Auctions As Houses Expect Heated Sales	Art collectors opening their mailboxes this month will find auction catalogs bursting with famous images. There is Brancusi's sculpture ''The Kiss,'' shown recently at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; a Modigliani portrait so loved by its owner that she has repeatedly refused to lend it for any museum exhibitions; ''0 Through 9,'' a 1961 Jasper Johns drawing from one of the artist's best-known series; and Andy Warhol's 1963 Pop image of race riots in Birmingham, Ala. Sensing that a heated market may soon reach its peak, collectors have consigned hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of artworks for the November sales at New York's auction houses. Sotheby's and Christie's say the estimated sales totals are the highest in nearly 15 years.
2004-09-23	For Sale: A Diva's Eccentric Legacy	FANS of no-flaw decorating and meticulous housekeeping, brace yourselves. The French decorator Madeleine Castaing saw beauty in plastic flowers, considered the straight pin an essential decorating tool and loved leopard-spot wall-to-wall carpet. From the looks of Maison de Lèves, her country house in this picture-postcard village a few miles from her hometown, Chartres, she also had no problem with half-finished paint jobs. The tops of two niches in the salon are partially painted sky blue, as if the painter had been interrupted by the telephone and never returned.
2004-09-17	$78,000 for a Cane That Helped a Legend Walk the Line	In his 1964 song ''Understand Your Man,'' Johnny Cash gave some bitter and specific estate instructions to the woman he was leaving in the dust: ''You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army,'' he sang, ''and everything else I leave behind.'' Over a career of almost five decades, Mr. Cash ended up with quite a few more than two suits. And when he died a year ago this week, many of those suits, along with quite a few other things he left behind, ended up in a place with much more cachet than a charity rack -- on the Upper East Side at Sotheby's, which ended its auction yesterday of the singer's effects and those of his wife, June Carter Cash, collecting $3,984,260 for the Cash family.
2004-09-08	How High's The Bidding, Mama?	THE blue Rolls Royce sat at the York Street curb as though the man in black had parked it there himself as fair warning to all those Manhattan fat cats drinking their fancy coffee and smoking their big cigars. Hello, I'm Johnny Cash, and I'm in town. Johnny Cash is not in town, of course. He died a year ago next week at the age of 71. His famous black mane had gone to white, his fierce eyes had softened to acceptance, and he met death with the dignity of one who knew sharecropper poverty, wrestled with the darkest demons and used his bass-baritone -- like grinding tires on a rutted road -- to give voice to those without.
2004-08-29	When Beauty and Value Are in the Beholder's Eyes	FOR Michael A. Moses, the Will Barnet painting that hangs in his Greenwich Village living room is not just a lovely, if melancholy, work by a respected American artist. It's also an investment and, by his reckoning, a good one. Professor Moses, who teaches management at New York University, figures the painting has appreciated about 13 percent a year since he and his wife bought it about a decade ago.
2004-08-11	Sale of a Picasso Lifts Sotheby's in Quarter	Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the world's largest publicly traded auction house, said that it earned $42.5 million in the second quarter, almost tripling the year-earlier income, helped by a recovery in the art auction market. Sotheby's said the income, which meant a profit of 68 cents a share, was up from $14.2 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 54 percent, to $169.5 million.
2004-07-16	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Plea In Theft Of Kennedy Items	A man charged with stealing more than three dozen items that once belonged to John F. Kennedy Jr. from a Manhattan warehouse pleaded guilty yesterday to misdemeanor larceny and received a $1,000 fine and conditional discharge from Manhattan Criminal Court. Prosecutors said the man, Patrick Gallagher, a former Sotheby's employee, took about 35 of Mr. Kennedy's things from a Sotheby's warehouse where they were stored, and sold them. Susan Saulny (NYT)
2004-07-08	Long Suspect, a Vermeer Is Vindicated by $30 Million Sale	The first painting by the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer to come to auction in more than 80 years -- and one that for decades has been suspected of being fake -- sold for $30 million Wednesday night at Sotheby's here. The overflowing salesroom burst into applause when George Gordon, an expert in the Sotheby's old-master paintings department, took the winning bid by telephone. While the auction house is not saying who the buyer was, it is believed to be Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino owner.
2004-07-06	Sotheby's And Hirst To Auction London Chic	When it opened in 1998, the Pharmacy epitomized London chic. Everything in this Notting Hill restaurant -- from the butterfly paintings and glass-fronted medicine cabinets to the aspirin-shaped bar stools and match boxes illustrated with surgical tools -- was designed by Damien Hirst, a leading member of London's Young British Artists. For nearly six years people from all over the world flocked to the Pharmacy to ogle the celebrity regulars like Kate Moss, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. In September the Pharmacy closed, a victim of its own trendiness. ''It was a slow death,'' Mr. Hirst said in a telephone interview. ''People gradually stopped going.''
2004-06-25	INSIDE ART	Handpicked By the Agnellis There are celebrity auctions of property from the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Elton John and most recently Katharine Hepburn, and then there are sales of art and objects with celebrity value that comes from another kind of pedigree. This week Sotheby's announced an Oct. 23 auction of about 100 pieces of furniture and decorative arts from the collection of Marella Agnelli, the widow of Giovanni Agnelli, the Fiat chairman, who died last year. The 100 objects being sold are from the couple's Park Avenue apartment, which Mrs. Agnelli sold this year. Sotheby's expects the sale to bring $7 million to $11 million.
2004-06-19	IN BRIEF	Big Price for Big Book The master copy of the working draft of the book ''Alcoholics Anonymous,'' which belonged to William Wilson, a co-founder of A.A., was sold at auction yesterday for $1.576 million. Sotheby's sold the 161-page manuscript, considered the bible of A.A., to a classic book collector from La Jolla, Calif., said Matthew Weigman, a spokesman.
2004-06-14	My Name Is the Big Book. My Future Is Open.	On June 10, 1935, Robert Smith, a physician from Akron, Ohio, took his last drink. He and William Wilson, better known as Dr. Bob and Bill W., had no idea that the date would later mark the beginning of what some consider one of the most important movements in the 20th century: Alcoholics Anonymous. Wilson later wrote an account of their philosophy -- that only an alcoholic could help another alcoholic quit drinking -- and the lives of other alcoholics that is referred to as the Big Book, the movement's bible. Now Sotheby's is planning to auction what it says is Wilson's master copy of the working draft of ''Alcoholics Anonymous,'' the Big Book's disarmingly straightforward official title. Its value has been estimated by the auction house as $300,000 to $500,000. The sale, scheduled for Friday, has created excited speculation among collectors and scholars about who will buy it, and a debate about its value and rightful place.
2004-06-13	They Wore The Pants	Day after day, adoring fans queued up to pay homage to an American icon, a star who burned through the screen, somehow seeming both regal and regular. There was that inimitable voice that braced you up; that elegant posture that made you want to stand taller; that confident gait that was more a glide than a walk; that luminous smile, quick wit and thick mane; that early-to-bed, fresh outdoorsy face and athletic physique that was the casually glamorous American look Ralph Lauren aspired to when he was still Ralph Lifschitz of the Bronx.
2004-06-11	INSIDE ART	The Sellers Are Famous, Too Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and Modern art on June 21 in London has stirred a lot of talk this week, not because of the art, but because of who's selling much of it.
2004-06-07	Driven by Wealth and Patriotism, Chinese Collectors Bid for Their Treasures	When Sotheby's opens the bidding on some prize Chinese antiquities at its New Bond Street auction rooms in London on June 9, more than a dozen mainland Chinese art collectors will be there. The rise of the Chinese art buyer has been swift and spirited. Five years ago private art collectors on the mainland were virtually unheard of. Now, driven by plenty of money and a patriotic rush to return treasures smuggled away over the centuries, Chinese collectors are bidding here as well as in New York and London.
2004-06-03	Celebrity Keepsakes	Today, when Sotheby's opens its exhibition of property to be auctioned from Katharine Hepburn's estate, the public can see for the first time two startling, unflattering self-portraits. One shows Hepburn with Spencer Tracy, both in profile; he is rough-jawed and she has large squares all over her face to represent freckles. The drawing is playful, but she looks as if she has chickenpox. An even stranger portrait is a full-faced drawing of herself in which her mouth is made of blood-red gashes, her cheekbones are cadaverously sharp and her eyes so blazing green they look spooky -- an image that reveals more of her cold, hard side than she ever did onscreen (maybe more than she intended). These astonishing glimpses of a different Hepburn are not typical of the items Sotheby's will sell, though. A more representative object, and by far the most affecting, is the bronze bust of Tracy that she made in the 1960's, kept by her bedside at home and carried with her when she traveled. Just three inches high, it was her portable Spencer. (The exhibition runs through Wednesday, with the auction on June 10 and 11, at 1334 York Avenue, at 72nd Street, in Manhattan.)
2004-05-30	They Put the Chintzy in Chintz	DOES anybody have better bad taste than members of America's upper class, a group Paul Fussell once categorized as ''the top out-of-sights?'' The visual clichés of the type are the stuff of legend (and plays by A. R. Gurney). Their houses are furnished with gravy-colored ancestor portraits, threadbare Tabriz rugs from Aunt Millicent, China export porcelain held together with Krazy Glue and upholstered furniture whose errant springs ambush the unwary sitter.. In an era of billionaire surfeit, representatives of Old Money seem scarcer than ever, glimpses into their lives and nutty habitats correspondingly rare. By coincidence, this has been a particularly rich season in opportunities to view the vanishing folkways of the genus High WASP. First came a flurry of posthumous shelter magazine appreciations of C. Z. Guest, the Boston-born socialite whose Long Island estate was an anthology of still-beloved class clichés, from ocelot-print carpets installed to disguise her dogs' muddy paw prints to the greenhouse orchids she liked to display in plastic pots.
2004-05-24	ARTS BRIEFING	HIGHLIGHTS ART: UNKNOWN RAPHAEL -- The fat-cheeked cherub looked familiar to Christiana Romali even though it had spent most of the 20th century tucked in a cardboard folder in a bundle of dull Italian drawings in a drawer in a London home. Ms. Romali happens to be a Sotheby's expert on old master drawings, The Guardian of London reported, and the cherub's head among the drawings brought in for routine evaluation looked very much like a much prettier head of the Christ child in ''Ansidei Madonna,'' a Raphael painting in the National Gallery in London. Experts there saw a likeness, too, and infrared analysis of the painting revealed an ever-closer resemblance. The previously unknown Raphael red-chalk sketch on a scrap of paper smaller than a postcard is believed to date from 1505, and when it is sold next month, it is expected to bring up to $125,000.
2004-05-21	ANTIQUES	Furniture, Too, Can Be Noble Louis XIV, the Sun King, seldom gets enough credit for his patronage of French artists and craftsmen. Proclaimed king of France at age 5, he was in his 20's in 1662 when he established his country's first organization devoted to producing French objects of art, the Manufacture Royale des Meubles de la Couronne.
2004-05-20	ART: THE WYNNS' NEW SARGENT	The Las Vegas casino owner Stephen A. Wynn and his wife, Elaine, spent $8.8 million at Sotheby's yesterday for one of John Singer Sargent's best-known portraits. ''Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and His Wife,'' from 1885, the second of three Sargent paintings of Stevenson, the Scottish novelist and poet, is unlike the more formal commissions that the artist is known for. It shows him in a velveteen jacket walking as he tweaks his mustache; his wife in Indian dress sitting in a chair may be glimpsed at the right of the canvas. Sargent gave the portrait to the Stevensons, who hung it in the living room of their house in Dorset, England. The painting comes from the Greentree Foundation, which has been selling portions of the fabled art collection first formed by Payne and Helen Hay Whitney and their son, John Hay Whitney, the financier and ambassador to Britain and his wife, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney. Records show that Mrs. Payne Whitney bought the painting at a sale of Stevenson's estate in 1914 and left it to her son. Mr. Wynn said yesterday that he planned to hang the painting in his new casino, the Wynn Las Vegas Resort and Country Club, scheduled to open in 2005. CAROL VOGEL
2004-05-14	Proclaiming Your Status From the Top	''Humans are the only animals that wear hats,'' said Thomas Murray, a dealer who specializes in artifacts from Indonesia and island cultures. ''In fact, wearing hats is what makes us human. It's a fundamental commonality to our human-ness.'' In tribal societies, headdresses rule. It's not the clothes but the hat that often makes a man (or woman). The headdress is a universal adornment. ''It's the great unifier,'' Mr. Murray said.
2004-05-13	Sotheby's Tops Estimate With 100 Percent Sale Result	Riding on the coattails of Christie's $102.1 million sale, which set a record on Tuesday night for postwar and contemporary art, Sotheby's scored 100 percent last night. While the offerings were not as strong as those at Christie's and the $65.6 million total was not nearly so impressive, the auction showed further evidence of a blossoming market. Price levels rose for works from every period, from a classic 44-year-old painting by Clyfford Still to a year-old canvas by Takashi Murakami. ''The collecting lifestyle is extremely intoxicating,'' said Sandy Heller, a Manhattan dealer. ''People enjoy buying things at auction.''
2004-05-11	Sotheby's Swings to Profit	Sotheby's Holdings had its largest quarterly profit since 1998 after revenue more than doubled, the company reported yesterday. First-quarter net income was $36.7 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with a loss of $27.6 million, or 45 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose to $106.4 million from $41.2 million.
2004-05-08	This Is Not a Pipe	If nothing else, the sale at Sotheby's on Wednesday night proved once again the power of round numbers. Picasso's ''Boy with a Pipe (The Young Apprentice),'' painted almost a century ago, was sold to an anonymous bidder for $104.1 million. The fun was seeing the $100 million mark broken because the bidding had already well surpassed the $82.5 million paid 14 years ago for van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet.'' When asked the obvious question, John Richardson, Picasso's biographer, said, ''I don't think any painting in the world is worth $100 million.'' His comment reminds us of what a strange commodity art really is. In a certain sense, what was really at auction wasn't a Picasso painting. It was the ownership of a Picasso painting. The price makes this Picasso not the most valuable Picasso, but the costliest one to have been put up for auction. The most valuable paintings are, almost inherently, the ones that will never undergo the test of valuation -- the ones that hang serenely on museum walls, like Picasso's ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' in the Museum of Modern Art.
2004-05-07	Picasso Still Going Strong As First Auction Week Ends	''Picasso certainly is the flavor of the week,'' said Nancy Whyte, a private dealer, as the gavel fell on the final lot of Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art last night. Still reeling from the sale of a 1905 Picasso for a record-breaking $104.1 million on Wednesday night, Sotheby's was testing slightly more modest market levels with an auction of Impressionist and modern art from various owners. The sale totaled $96 million, just shy of its high estimate, $99 million. Of the 52 works, only 10 went unsold. Picassos from various periods were stars, and many brought particularly strong prices.
2004-05-06	Picasso Work From Rose Period Sets Auction Record for a Painting	A rare Picasso, painted when the artist was just 24, became the most expensive painting ever sold at auction when an anonymous buyer purchased it for $104.1 million last night at Sotheby's. The price paid for ''Boy With a Pipe (The Young Apprentice),'' a 1905 work from Picasso's Rose Period, eclipsed the previous record for a painting, set in 1990 when van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was sold at Christie's in New York for $82.5 million. The Picasso was one of 34 works auctioned last night from the famed Whitney collection in a sale that totaled $189.8 million, far above the high estimate of $157 million. Of the 34 lots, all but two found buyers. Proceeds from the sale go to the Greentree Foundation, established by the Whitney family to promote international cooperation.
2004-05-05	Modern Art Does Well As Auction Season Opens	Art dealers and collectors mumbled polite phrases like ''waiting for Whitney'' and ''dress rehearsal'' last night as they poured out of Christie's Rockefeller Center salesroom after a thin sale of Impressionist and modern art. The auction, the first of six important evening sales this week and next, had the misfortune to be a curtain-raiser to Sotheby's sale of the legendary Whitney collection. First formed by the heirs of Payne and Helen Whitney, who made a fortune made from oil, tobacco, street railways and real estate, and later by their son John Hay Whitney, the financier, publisher and ambassador to Britain, and his wife, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, it is now part of the Greentree Foundation's holdings. Among those works, to be sold tonight, is a 1903 Picasso, ''Boy With a Pipe,'' that could become the world's most expensive painting, along with world-class works by masters like Manet and Degas.
2004-05-04	A Book on Fixing Prices to Arrive Just as Auctions Begin	Timed to arrive in bookstores as the important spring auctions get under way this week, ''The Art of the Steal'' by Christopher Mason recounts the scandal that rocked the art world four years ago and that Sotheby's and Christie's would prefer to forget: how the longtime auction rivals colluded to fix prices. In 2002 A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's chairman at the time, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison for his part in the conspiracy. Its chief executive then, Diana D. Brooks, was spared prison and sentenced to three years' probation and six months' house arrest.
2004-04-21	ARTS BRIEFING	HIGHLIGHTS FOR LOVE OF ART -- A widely reproduced painting by Jack Vettriano, a self-taught artist who left school at 16, set a record of $1.3 million at auction on Monday by Sotheby's in Scotland. The sale of 14 Vettriano paintings took in $3.5 million, and the best-known work, ''The Singing Butler,'' eclipsed the previous auction record for a Scottish painting, $750,000 in 2001 by a work by Samuel Joseph Peploe, The Associated Press reported. ''The Singing Butler'' depicts a woman in a red gown and a man in evening clothes dancing on a damp beach beneath a lowering sky while a windblown maid and a butler hold umbrellas to shield them from the elements. Although some 12 million of Mr. Vettriano's works are visible on posters, greeting cards and mugs, none are to be found in British national collections, and many critics find him simplistic. ''We have offered them to the museums and all have been dismissed,'' his dealer, Tom Hewlett, said yesterday. Explaining the artist's popularity, Mr. Hewlett, owner of the Portland Gallery in London, said, ''His work has that narrative quality that is not much seen these days and with which people can relate.'' The seller was a Scottish collector, Alex Cruickshank. The painting was sold to an anonymous private buyer from Britain, The A.P. reported. FOOTNOTES The Recording Industry Association of America has ended a program that offered amnesty from lawsuits by recording companies if downloaders admitted to illegally sharing music online, The Associated Press reported. Citing court documents, the news agency said the trade organization dropped the program earlier this month because it considers the public sufficiently aware now to know that downloaders can be sued for file sharing. . . . While Americans have been flocking to see the violent ''Kill Bill: Vol. 2'' and ''The Passion of the Christ,'' British moviegoers have kept ''Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed'' at the top of the box office for three consecutive weeks, Reuters reported yesterday. Weekend receipts were $3.24 million. . . . The producers of ''Sixteen Wounded'' announced yesterday that the play would close on Sunday unless business at the Walter Kerr Theater picks up. The drama, about the friendship between a Holocaust survivor and a Palestinian, opened Thursday.
2004-04-16	INSIDE ART	Split Decision On Tomato Plants Sometimes auction house experts find themselves with an embarrassment of riches. That's how it seemed to dealers who heard that Sotheby's had won both the extraordinary collection of Impressionist and Modern paintings from John Hay Whitney, the sportsman, financier and publisher, and his wife, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, and paintings that had belonged to the movie producer Ray Stark, who died in January, and his wife, Fran, who died in 1992. Each collection includes a Picasso still life of tomato plants.
2004-04-15	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Theft Of J.F.K. Jr. Items Is Reported	An employee of Sotheby's, the Manhattan auction house where items that had been owned by John F. Kennedy Jr. were stored for safekeeping, has been charged with stealing dozens of the items. Among the 35 items reported stolen were a Father's Day card written by Mr. Kennedy, left, when he was a toddler in the White House, and a letter from Queen Elizabeth II to President and Mrs. Kennedy congratulating them on their son's birth. Prosecutors say that Mr. Gallagher sold the items -- which have been returned -- for $5,000. Mr. Gallagher was arraigned on Tuesday on charges of grand larceny and possession of stolen property, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. The arrest was first reported yesterday by The New York Post. Mr. Gallagher's lawyer, Martin D. Kane, did not return a call seeking comment. Stacy Albin (NYT)
2004-04-14	So, Don Juan, What's Dessert?	Dinner often plays a role in the story of Don Juan, the mythic, sybaritic rake who inspired so many composers, playwrights and poets. Lavish table settings typical of Byron's epic poem about the don will be the focus of a lecture on May 4 at Sotheby's Institute of Art, 1334 York Avenue (71st Street). Elaborate 19th-century English tables like the one shown at left, from Fairfax House in York, England, will be described by Peter Brown, director of Fairfax House.
2004-04-11	The Pipes Are Calling	Men and women in plaid were out in full regalia to honor their Scottish, Irish and English descent during last weekend's short, noisy Tartan Day Parade, which began a week of promotions for Scottish imports. The marchers went up the Avenue of the Americas from 45th Street to 58th Street, with 35 pipe bands and a contingent of Scottish terriers. On Monday night, a gala fashion show called ''Dressed to Kilt'' was given by the Friends of Scotland at Sotheby's. Three evening dresses, left, by Michael Kaye, a New York designer, were a high point.

2004-03-31	A Vermeer, Once Suspect, Will Be Offered at Sotheby's	A painting by the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer that for decades was suspected of being a fake will be offered for sale at Sotheby's in London this summer, becoming the first Vermeer to go on the block in more than 80 years, the company announced yesterday. The painting, ''Young Woman Seated at the Virginal,'' was confirmed to be by Vermeer after 10 years of meticulous study and testing by a group of scholars, museum curators, painting conservators, costume experts, paint analysts and auction house experts.
2004-03-12	Sales of Artwork Lift Profit at Sotheby's	Sotheby's Holdings, the auction house, reported fourth-quarter profit and a 17 percent gain in revenue yesterday on increased sales of Old Master paintings, Impressionists and Russian works of art. Net income was $20.2 million, or 33 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $6.53 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $136.9 million from $116.9 million.

Cendant, which is based in Manhattan and both owns and franchises real estate agencies, announced yesterday that it was paying $100 million to buy the 15 Sotheby's International Realty offices, in locations that include Manhattan; Beverly Hills; Southampton, N.Y.; and San Francisco. The purchase includes the right to franchise the Sotheby's name to other real estate firms throughout the country.
2004-02-11	Beloved by Czars, Capitalists and One Mother Hen	SHE played mother hen for three decades to Malcolm Forbes's felicitous collection of nine Fabergé eggs and other bejeweled baubles, snapped up en masse this month by Russia's fourth-richest mogul for around $100 million before Sotheby's even got it to the auction block. So the curator Margaret Kelly Trombly might be allotted a few postpartum pangs. No more imperial eggs, synonymous with the heyday of czarist Russia and the romantic tragedy of Nicholas and Alexandra, to tend? It seems impossible not to think of this as a whole new spin on the empty-nest syndrome; since Ms. Trombly is a careerist and feminist who didn't marry until she was 48, and is childless, this is her only spin on it. She's bearing up well. Her favorite egg (the pearl-encrusted Lilies of the Valley model) and Mr. Forbes's favorite (the Fifteenth Anniversary Egg) as well as the most expensive Easter egg ever hatched (the 1897 Coronation Egg, estimated by Sotheby's at a potential $24 million) are gone forever from the Forbes Galleries, where they were beloved focal points of a collection of antique toys, presidential manuscripts and art that attracts 60,000 visitors annually. Ms. Trombly, vice president of the Forbes Collection and coordinator of its licensing operations, is resident docent.
2004-02-11	ARTS BRIEFING	HIGHLIGHTS SHANGHAI: NO 'VAGINA MONOLOGUES' -- A Chinese-language production of ''The Vagina Monologues'' by Eve Ensler, scheduled to open last night in Shanghai for a monthlong run, has been canceled, The Associated Press reported. An unidentified theater employee told the news agency that the Shanghai Cultural Bureau gave no reason for the ban, but that the Shanghai Drama Arts Theater, where the performance was to have played, was informing callers that the time was ''not ripe'' in China for this production. The play addresses female sexuality and domestic violence. The BBC reported, however, that a spokesman for the theater denied that the government intervened because of objections to the play's sexually explicit content. ''It's our own problem, not the government's,'' the spokesman said. DIANA ROSS, JAIL BOUND -- The pop diva Diana Ross, 59, was ordered by an Arizona judge to spend two days in jail after pleading no contest on Monday to driving under the influence of alcohol, Reuters reported. According to her lawyer, Stephen Paul Barnard, Ms. Ross entered her plea by telephone and will probably serve her time in a jail near her home in Los Angeles. ''I think she is very pleased to have this behind her,'' Mr. Barnard said. Ms. Ross was picked up early in the morning of Dec. 30, 2002, by Tucson police officers responding to a call about a motorist driving the wrong way through traffic. FAREWELL TO FABERGÉ -- Beginning tomorrow, Sotheby's will offer the New York public a last chance to see the most expensive dozen eggs in the world: the Fabergé treasures from the Forbes collection, valued at more than $90 million and bought last week by a Russian billionaire for return to Russia. The nine imperial Fabergé eggs and three others that from the collection of the family of Malcolm Forbes will be on view daily, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., through Sunday in Sotheby's 10th-floor galleries at 1334 York Avenue, at 72nd Street in Manhattan. Admission is free. The eggs, like the one above, and more than 165 other pieces in the collection were bought by the Russian industrialist Viktor Vekselberg two months before they were to be auctioned. LINCOLN PRIZE WINNERS -- The Rhodes professor of American History at Oxford University has become the first British scholar to win the Lincoln Prize. He is Richard J. Carwardine, chosen to receive the $30,000 first prize and a bronze replica of Augustus Saint-Gaudens's lifesize bust ''Lincoln the Man'' for ''his highly original, tour de force analytical biography,'' ''Lincoln'' (Pearson Education Limited). In addition, Prof. John Y. Simon of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale is to receive a special Lincoln Prize of $20,000 for his achievement in editing 26 volumes to date of ''The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'' (Southern Illinois University Press). The 14th annual Lincoln Prizes, announced today, are administered by the Lincoln and Soldiers Institute at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pa. RODDY DOYLE VS. JAMES JOYCE -- James Joyce's birthday present from the Irish writer Roddy Doyle was a figurative slap in the face. '' 'Ulysses' could have done with a good editor,'' Mr. Doyle told a gathering in New York to commemorate the birthday of Joyce (1882-1941), the BBC reported. ''People are always putting 'Ulysses' in the Top 10 books, but I doubt any of those people were really moved by it.'' As for ''Finnegans Wake,'' Joyce's successor to ''Ulysses,'' Mr. Doyle called it ''a complete waste of time,'' though he said he had read only three pages. This year Dublin plans to observe the centenary of Bloomsday, June 16, 1904, the date ''Ulysses'' unfolds. The planned events include a breakfast for 10,000 people on O'Connell Street in Dublin. FOOTNOTES What goes around comes around. Just as a revival of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' is scheduled to open on Feb. 26 at the Minskoff Theater, ''Rent,'' at the Nederlander Theater, played its 3,243rd performance last night, passing the original production of ''Fiddler'' to occupy 10th place on the list of Broadway's longest-running shows. . . . It's official. On May 4 Michael McKean will replace Harvey Fierstein as the ample Edna Turnblad in the hit production of ''Hairspray'' at the Neil Simon Theater. Mr. McKean, 56, most recently made news on Sunday night as a Grammy Award-winning writer of the song ''A Mighty Wind.'' As an actor he is probably best known as Lenny Kosnowski in ''Laverne and Shirley'' on television.
2004-02-05	Fabergé Collection Bought by Russian For a Return Home	A Russian billionaire has bought the entire Fabergé collection owned by the family of Malcolm Forbes and is taking it back to Russia. Just two months before the nine imperial Easter eggs, along with some 180 other pieces, were to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York, Victor Vekselberg, one of a new generation of Russian industrialists, bought what he called ''perhaps the most significant example of our cultural heritage outside Russia,'' according to a statement released by the auction house yesterday.
2004-01-23	INSIDE ART	Another Kind Of Sculpture Like every other museum in the country, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston looks for inventive ways to increase the size and breadth of its audience. That is the motivation behind ''Speed, Style and Beauty: Cars From the Ralph Lauren Collection,'' to be shown in 2005. The exhibition will present 15 cars by makers like Bugatti, Ferrari, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Alfa Romeo.
2004-01-15	Famed Whitney Collection Of Art Is on the Block	More than 40 Impressionist and modern paintings from one of the last great American collections in private hands are to be sold at Sotheby's in New York on May 5, the auction house announced yesterday. Sotheby's estimates the sale could bring $140 million to $190 million. The collection includes works by Manet, Degas, Monet and Sargent as well as a rare Rose Period Picasso, ''Boy With a Pipe.'' It was formed over two generations beginning with Payne and Helen Hay Whitney, heirs to a fortune made from oil, tobacco, street railways and real estate and then by their son, John Hay Whitney, the sportsman, financier, publisher and former ambassador to Britain, and his wife, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney.
2004-01-09	Fabled Trove of Fabergé Eggs Goes to Auction, Jewels and All	The last pieces of a legendary collection, the nine Imperial Fabergé Easter eggs from Czarist Russia acquired over a lifetime by Malcolm Forbes, the publishing magnate, are to be sold at Sotheby's in New York in April, the auction house announced yesterday. The collection, second in size only to the 10 in the Kremlin, will be offered along with 180 other Fabergé objects from the Forbes holdings. Together they are expected to sell for at least $90 million, at a time when the market for them seems receptive.
2004-01-02	Before Film, A Family Record On Canvas	American folk art portraits can be primitive or accomplished, but style mattered little to the 18th- and 19th-century families who inherited these prized possessions. ''Before the daguerreotype, the best way for people to pass down likenesses was by commissioning portraits,'' said Arthur Liverant of Nathan Liverant & Son, a Connecticut dealer in American antiques since 1920. ''J. A. Davis -- no one knows his first name -- was one of many itinerant artists who traveled around America by horseback, carriage or train to paint portraits. He would go to a town, open a storefront and advertise that he was doing likenesses. He stayed there as long as local people employed his services.''
2003-12-13	Landmark Mies House Goes to Preservationists	In just seven minutes of intense telephone bidding, preservationists won the battle yesterday for Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's legendary Farnsworth House, paying $7.5 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. They competed against only one other telephone bidder, who was not identified. The National Trust, which will operate the house along with the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois, plan to open it to the public as a museum sometime this spring.
2003-12-11	A '51 Mies Classic Comes Down to the Wire	FOR SALE: Weekend house, Chicago area; 2 bedrooms; 2 baths; 2,233 sq. ft.; newly renovated; furnished; asking $6 million; will consider any reasonable offer above $4.5 million. Tomorrow, the Farnsworth House, designed by Mies van der Rohe and acknowledged to be one of the most important Modernist residences extant anywhere, is being offered for sale by Lord Peter Palumbo, its owner of 35 years, at Sotheby's in New York. Lord Palumbo bought it from Dr. Edith Farnsworth, who commissioned the house, which was completed in 1951. The sale includes its 58-acre lot.
2003-12-08	ARTS BRIEFING	HIGHLIGHTS AUCTION: HEMINGWAY LETTERS -- Sotheby's will sell a trove of the young Ernest Hemingway's books and letters on Wednesday in New York. Among them is a letter that Hemingway, then 18 and a cub reporter for The Kansas City Star, wrote to his older sister, Marcelline, in which he declared, ''Say kid this newspaper business is the life.'' He boasts of his encounters with celebrities and politicians, his trips to the theater and other perks of the profession. The items, from the collection of Hemingway's nephew, John Sanford, include Marcelline's own first-edition copy of ''In Our Time'' and a letter Hemingway sent from Europe to his sisters Marcelline and Madelaine in which he says that he has met ''a wonderful American girl over here,'' a Red Cross nurse named Agnes von Kurowsky, who became the model for Catherine Barkley in ''A Farewell to Arms.'' JAZZ BY TWOS -- Merkin Concert Hall in Manhattan tonight begins a new, four-part series of jazz piano concerts linking two players as mentor and protégé. ''Monday Nites: No Minimum'' begins with two deeply intellectual players who aren't too brainy to swing: Andrew Hill, 66, who has a doctorate from Colgate University, and his former student Jason Moran, 28. Other duos in the series include Randy Weston and Rodney Kendrick (Feb. 9), Hank Jones and Benny Green (March 22), and Fred Hersch, above, and Brad Mehldau (June 21). Merkin Hall is at 129 West 67th Street. . . . Mr. Hersch will also be doing a set of duos this week at the Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street. Each night from tomorrow through Sunday, he will be playing with a different collaborator: the saxophonists Lee Konitz (tomorrow), Jane Ira Bloom (Thursday) and Joe Lovano (Friday); the percussionist John Hollenbeck (Wednesday); and the singers Kate McGarry (Saturday) and Kurt Elling (Sunday).
2003-12-05	INSIDE ART	A Brooklyn Home For Feminist Art Like all museums, the Brooklyn Museum of Art is grappling with budget cuts. (It closed for two weeks in August, and each staff member was on furlough for at least a week.) But that hasn't stopped the museum from forging ahead with a $63 million capital project that includes a new front entrance and plaza scheduled to open on April 17. Or its latest endeavor, the establishment of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art.
2003-11-13	AT HOME WITH: James Zemaitis; Blue-Chip Modern. It's So Fly.	DRESSED in a track-suit jacket, a skateboarding T-shirt and blue jeans, James Zemaitis, 35, looks like a fairly average young professional living on the Upper West Side. This, despite the fact that Mr. Zemaitis is the new director of 20th-century design for Sotheby's in New York, where even the publicists live in suits. Mr. Zemaitis's first sales, on Dec. 11 and 12, will culminate in Lot 800 -- otherwise known as the Farnsworth House, designed by Mies van der Rohe and one of the most famous Modernist residences in the world. The presale estimate is $4.5 million to $6 million. The total estimate for the two days is $13.6 million to $18.9 million, the highest anywhere for 20th-century design.
2003-11-13	Contemporary Art Stays Strong for a Second Night	A 40ish crowd with new money made in the world financial markets and a compulsion to spend it fueled the market for contemporary art at Sotheby's last night. For these shoppers, the hot labels are Warhol and Rothko rather than Gucci and Prada. ''They're jumping into the market, and they want to buy iconic postwar works,'' said Tobias Meyer, director of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide and the evening's auctioneer.
2003-11-07	INSIDE ART	And Coming Up, A Rare Bierstadt It may seem as if all eyes in the art world are focused on this week's important Impressionist and modern art auctions and next week's sales of contemporary art. But for collectors and dealers with a special interest in American paintings, drawings and sculpture, the big sales don't happen until next month.
2003-11-06	Price for a Klimt Soars to $29 Million	In the auction world, all it takes is three determined people with big egos and bank accounts to match. That's why a 1917 Klimt landscape sold for $29.1 million last night at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art. The price surprised even the auction house experts. The painting, which depicts a house and its flowering gardens in a rich tapestry of colors, wasn't the only bright spot of the evening. The best works fetched high prices, but some of the rest went unsold without so much as a nibble.
2003-10-30	Fall Art Auctions Offer A Wealth of Big Names	For the first time in about four years, ''well timed'' deaths, in auction world parlance, have brought sought-after works to the fall market. These estate sales have in turn encouraged other sellers to ride what they perceive will be a tailwind of excitement. The result is two weeks of back-to-back auctions, starting Tuesday, featuring prime examples of works by masters like van Gogh, Léger, Klimt and Jasper Johns. Collectors who have put art on sale at this fall's round of important auctions include the tennis star John McEnroe, who is selling a steel sculpture by David Smith; the casino owner Stephen A. Wynn, who is selling a painting of a Modigliani nude; and the newsprint magnate Peter Brant, who is auctioning paintings by artists like Warhol and Basquiat. The Austrian-born financier Wolfgang Flottl, who has bought and sold many important paintings and drawings over the years, is a seller this season, too. He has given Sotheby's a van Gogh watercolor to auction that he bought only six years ago. And LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods company, which briefly owned Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg, is selling a Klimt painting.
2003-10-27	Beethoven on the Block, As Prices Match Artistry	A manuscript of the Scherzo from Beethoven's String Quartet in E flat (Op. 127) is to be offered for sale at Sotheby's, in London, on Dec. 5. It is the second major Beethoven manuscript to come up for sale this year, the first being a 575-page score of the complete Ninth Symphony, which sold in May for $3.47 million, also through Sotheby's. Unlike that manuscript, which was prepared by a copyist but had Beethoven's corrections and comments on most of its pages, the quartet movement is entirely in Beethoven's hand. Sotheby's says it expects the manuscript to bring between $1.6 million and $2.5 million. It is currently owned by the Stifelsen Musikkulterens Framjande (Foundation for the Furthering of Music Culture), in Stockholm, which is selling it to raise money for the maintenance of its facilities and other holdings, which include manuscripts by Bizet, Donizetti and other 19th-century composers, as well as an important musical instrument collection.
2003-10-26	Bidding on Bill Blass, for Whom Things Made the Man	AMONG the handful of events that can fascinate the public and the bon ton equally is the sale of a deceased celebrity's possessions by a major auction house. Such spectacles brim with reverence and irreverence, with connoisseurship and voyeurism. They don't come around often. The last major one liquidated the effects of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1997. Before that, it was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' estate in 1996. Last week Sotheby's served up the possessions of Bill Blass, who died in 2002 at 79, and the crowds ate it up. The sale brought $13.6 million, more than double the high estimate. Bidders included serious collectors of English furniture, chichi decorators, a handful of glamorous ladies from Blass's inner circle and general fans of the designer, who lived at the apex of American fashion and society for decades.
2003-10-24	INSIDE ART	The 19th Century Running Rampant Nineteenth-century paintings are on view all over Manhattan this fall. The Metropolitan Museum has two shows, ''Crossing the Channel: British and French Painting in the Age of Romanticism,'' through Jan. 4, and ''A Private Passion: 19th-Century Paintings and Drawings From the Grenville L. Winthrop Collection, Harvard University,'' which opened yesterday and runs through Jan. 25. Nineteenth-century paintings have gained cachet since the enlarged Dahesh Museum opened last month in its new home at 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street.
2003-10-17	A Décor Collection, From Bill Blass	Bill Blass may have been a legendary fashion designer, but he never considered himself a collector. ''I'm not that pretentious,'' he told his friend John Richardson, the Picasso biographer who helped him buy pictures in London. Nevertheless, he never stopped buying antiques. ''Any town we went to on business, he would ask friends about the best antiques shops,'' said Tom Fallon, a New York fashion executive now with the Carlisle Collection who worked with Mr. Blass for 25 years. ''He never went anywhere without a list.''
2003-10-17	INSIDE ART	New Hopes In Houston The board of the Menil Collection in Houston named its new director yesterday: Josef Helfenstein, director of the Krannert Art Museum at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Arts for Transit program is having a productive fall as it finishes projects in subway stations around New York. One nearing completion is the Eastern Parkway-Brooklyn Museum station on the No. 2 and 3 lines, used by about 9,000 riders each weekday. The station is undergoing a $14 million renovation as part of the M.T.A.'s 2000-4 capital program.
2003-10-04	Celebrated Mies House Up for Auction	A landmark of 20th-century domestic architecture -- Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House on the Illinois prairie -- is heading for the auction block, Sotheby's announced yesterday. The house, a 1951 glass-and-steel design on 58 acres of prairie land in Plano, Ill., about 60 miles southwest of Chicago, belongs to Lord Palumbo, a British arts patron and former chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain. He bought it in 1968 from Edith Farnsworth, a prominent Chicago doctor, who had commissioned Mies to design it for her as a weekend retreat.
2003-10-03	INSIDE ART	The Legacy Of a Collector Artists like Agnes Martin and Martin Puryear, Lee Bontecou and Ed Ruscha captured the eye and the imagination of Vera G. List, the Manhattan philanthropist who died a year ago. List was fascinated by the artists of her day, often buying works just as they were completed.
2003-09-04	Auction Houses Find a Silver Mine in Midrange Sales	On a summer Monday morning, while the Long Island Expressway was still clogged with weekenders returning from the Hamptons, the second floor of Christie's Rockefeller Center headquarters was experiencing its own kind of traffic. Doug Cochrane, an antiques dealer from West Palm Beach, Fla., was perusing the roomlike settings of sideboards and dining tables, mirrors and porcelains, deciding whether there was anything he wanted to bid on at the coming House Sale, as Christie's calls its monthly auctions of affordable home furnishings. ''You do find variety at these sales, but they still tend to be pretty expensive despite the downturn in the market,'' Mr. Cochrane said. ''I'm always hoping to get lucky and discover something no one else has.''
2003-08-25	On View: How King Shaped The Dream	His most famous words -- ''I have a dream'' -- were extemporized. And he routinely delivered whole sermons from memory. But as an extraordinary exhibition of his papers, books and other documents at Sotheby's auction house in Manhattan makes clear, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an inveterate scribbler who jotted down thoughts and outlined speeches on the backs of envelopes and church programs and who scrawled entire essays in the flyleaves of paperbacks. Occupying 20,000 square feet -- nearly one a floor -- of the auction house, the sprawling exhibition opens to the public tomorrow and runs through Sept. 8. Sotheby's is offering the collection for private sale -- not at auction -- on behalf of the King estate.
2003-07-30	An Aboriginal Painting, Just a Souvenir, Brings a Windfall	JoAnne Walker always liked the small aboriginal painting she bought 30 years ago when she and her husband were temporarily posted in central Australia. It wasn't a showy piece and cost only $30, but it reminded her of the desert country she and her family used to explore around Alice Springs. Now settled in Ruston, La., she read an article three months ago in The New York Times about the increasing popularity of Australian aboriginal art and the high prices it can command.
2003-07-30	OFF THE MENU	Tastes of Vietnam Hue has moved in at 91 Charles Street (Bleecker Street) in Greenwich Village. Though its name is likely to be pronounced like Hugh, it refers to the Vietnamese city whose name is pronounced whey. The chef, Junnajet Hurapan, who was at Rain and at Ruby Foo's in Times Square, will prepare mostly authentic Vietnamese food like pork skewers with a fish sauce, and pho bo, the traditional beef soup. The restaurant has a bar and cafe on the ground floor and a dining room with a waterfall on the lower level. Its owners are the restaurateurs Karim Amatullah and Frank Prisinzano.
2003-07-18	INSIDE ART	Another Trip For 'David' The High Museum of Art in Atlanta will not be the only place to see Verrocchio's bronze sculpture ''David,'' one of the greatest masterpieces of Renaissance art, when it comes to the United States in November. The National Gallery of Art in Washington will exhibit it, too.
2003-07-13	Advice From Ex-Cons To a Jet-Set Jailbird: Best Walk on Eggs	RAYMOND CARTER'S release from prison followed a familiarly bleak script. After two years at the Wyoming Correctional Facility in upstate New York for sale of a controlled substance, he was granted his freedom on June 23, and given back his personal belongings -- a Social Security card and some medication -- then handed 40 bucks and a one-way bus ticket to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. He had a little time, so he savored a quiet meal at McDonald's. A few hours later he was jostling through the bustle of New York City and the crowds of Midtown. Though uncertain about his job prospects and his future, he was elated. ''You wanted to scream, 'I'm free!' '' he said. A. Alfred Taubman's reintroduction to society went down a little differently. After serving nine-and-a-half months of a year-and-a-day sentence for price-fixing, Mr. Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's, learned on June 13 at a halfway house in Detroit that he was a free man. Mr. Taubman's first move was to order his chauffeur to pick him up posthaste. After a quiet night at home in nearby Bloomfield Hills, Mich., with his wife, Judy, amid their collection of Jackson Pollocks and Kandinskys, Mr. Taubman, boarded his Gulfstream IV and headed straight for his sprawling oceanfront estate in the Hamptons. By evening, he was savoring a meal at Mirko's, an intimate restaurant in Water Mill, at the best table in the house.

Mr. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino owner and collector, set his alarm for 2 a.m. yesterday, sneaked into the bathroom so he wouldn't wake his wife, and bid by telephone on a Rembrandt self-portrait that was being auctioned at Sotheby's sale of old master paintings in London. He ended up buying the portrait for $11.3 million, above its $8 million estimate.

For about 40 years, Mr. Broad, the chairman of two Fortune 500 companies -- SunAmerica, a financial services company, and the KB Home Corporation, a tract-house building company -- and his wife, Edythe, have been buying major works by 20th-century artists, including Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha, Jeff Koons and Jean-Michel Basquiat.
2003-06-20	ANTIQUES	Friend of the Czar, Aide of the Czarina ''It took three years of frustration to find him,'' said Wolfram Koeppe, the associate curator of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was recalling his efforts to identify the subject of an impressive life-size wooden bust the Met acquired in 1996. Over the years, he compared the bust to faces on cameos, etchings, drawings, oil paintings and bronze busts. He read period descriptions of the physiognomies of princes. He studied the iconography of the decorations.
2003-06-08	Fractured Fairy Tale: An Archive of a Royal Romance	HE was a modern-minded, emotionally needy prince trapped in a stultifying world of tradition, ceremony and high propriety. She was another man's wife, admired for her intelligence, discretion and formidable skills on the tennis court. The affair didn't last, but if Edward VIII of Britain had run off with Freda Dudley Ward instead of Wallis Simpson, the evidence suggests that history might have treated him more kindly. Three hundred and thirteen letters that the man best known as the Duke of Windsor wrote to Dudley Ward between 1921 and 1923 will be offered for sale at Sotheby's New York on June 20, with an estimate of $100,000 to $150,000. The letters, signed with the name David, the last of the prince's seven given names, are the prize offerings in a sale of miscellaneous books and manuscripts, given the continued fascination with the saga of the man who gave up his throne for the woman he loved. Just not this particular one.
2003-05-30	An Emperor Who Escaped Notoriety	''We've had Hadrian, Nero, Marcus Aurelius and Augustus, but I can't recall an Antoninus Pius,'' said Richard M. Keresey, the antiquities specialist at Sotheby's in New York. He was referring to a marble portrait head of the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius (A.D. 86-161), which is in Sotheby's sale of antiquities on June 12. Antoninus Pius is not so well known because he was not a notorious dictator. His loyal service as a consul in Italy and proconsul of Asia led the Emperor Hadrian to adopt him as his son and successor in A.D. 138. Sotheby's head, 13 1/2 inches tall, has the face of a mature, seasoned man in his 50's. He has long, wavy hair, a full beard and mustache, deep-set eyes and a furrowed brow. The tip of his aquiline nose has broken off.
2003-05-23	ANTIQUES	A Pioneer And a Rebel, Still a Secret Wharton Esherick (1887-1970) was present at the creation of the American craft and studio furniture movement; in fact he made it possible.

2003-05-16	INSIDE ART	Rembrandt In Full Five years in the making, ''Rembrandt's Journey: Painter, Draftsman, Etcher,'' will open at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, on Oct. 26. It is the first American exhibition in decades to include international and national loans and explore the full range of the artist's work. The last exhibition of the artist's work in the United States was ''Rembrandt/Not Rembrandt,'' at the Metropolitan Museum in 1995, but it was based on works from the museum's collection.
2003-05-14	20th-Century Masters Dominate Art Auction	Penny-pinching, not passion, dominated the behavior of last night's audience at Sotheby's, in the first of three back-to-back auctions of contemporary art. Up for sale were classic works by masters whose price levels have, for the most part, either risen or stayed consistently high over the last few years. But optimistic estimates and mixed offerings made the sale less than riveting. Of the 46 works, seven failed to find buyers. The sale totaled $27.3 million, below the low estimate of $33.7 million.
2003-05-09	A Designer Bids Adieu To Art Deco	''I like to collect, but I'm not crazy to own things,'' said Karl Lagerfeld, the Paris-based couturier. ''I'm a fashion person. I'm excited by finding things, but in the end there's an accumulation and I want to get rid of it.'' He said that was why he is selling his collection of French 20th-century decorative arts on Thursday at Sotheby's in Paris. ''I'm buying 21st-century things now,'' he said. ''My three passions are fashion, books and photographs.'' Over the last two decades Mr. Lagerfeld has auctioned off other collections. In April 2000, for example, he made $21.3 million selling his 18th-century objets d'art and French furniture at Christie's in Monaco.
2003-05-07	A Renoir Shines as the Spring Art Sales Begin	An 1882 Renoir portrait of a French gentleman's wife sitting in her garden, deemed too daring by the husband who commissioned it because of its bright colors, is heading for Las Vegas. Stephen A. Wynn, the casino owner and art collector, bought the painting, ''In the Roses (Madame Léon Clapisson),'' for $23.5 million last night at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art. It was the most expensive painting in the sale, bringing just over its $20 million low estimate, and it is to go on view at his gallery in the lobby of the old Desert Inn until Mr. Wynn opens his new casino, Le Rêve.
2003-04-19	The Ninth, Heavy Mettle	Founding documents of a society are generally revered, preserved in vaults and treated as sacred. Inscribed on their pages are laws, ideas and declarations displaying mythic wisdom: here is how we have come to be; here is the source of our ideas; here is the foundation of what is yet to come. Any loss of such documents, as in the burning and looting of Iraqi antiquities last week, is ineffably tragic. But documents that survive generations of warfare and accidents take on ever greater power.

2003-04-07	For Sale: Beethoven's Scribbles on the Ninth	Sotheby's London is prepared to sell a musical manuscript -- the musical manuscript, one is tempted to say, given the few items that are likely to become available nowadays and the importance of the work involved -- Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In three bound volumes of 465 pages, the offering includes virtually the complete score of that symphony in manuscript. (Two fragments of the same manuscript reside in the Beethovenhaus in Bonn and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.) The hands are mainly those of two copyists, but Beethoven scribbled corrections and changes throughout. The manuscript may have been used at the work's premiere, in 1824, and it was the basis for the first printed edition, in 1826.
2003-03-21	One Horse Is Always A Winner	There is an old saw among decorators: you will never have a project published in a glossy magazine unless your interior features a Tang horse. That's not true, of course, but putting in a handsome Tang horse never hurts. These ancient Chinese pottery steeds are found in every kind of décor: minimalist, country, French, even deconstructivist. Their appeal is universal. Costing from a few thousand to a few million dollars apiece, a Tang horse is a litmus test for its owner's connoisseurship -- and wealth. It always has been. Tang horses have been status symbols for 1,500 years. They were made in China as tomb accouterments for the solace and use of the rich, the powerful and the imperial family in the afterlife.
2003-03-16	A Pastrami on Rye, Extra Mustard, And an Elizabethan Canopy Bed	''Would you like sauerkraut with that?'' asked George Way, amasser of one of America's foremost collections of 16th- and 17th-century Dutch and English furniture, paintings and decorative objects. The customer on the other side of the deli counter at a Pathmark in Bay Terrace, Staten Island, chewed expressively on a toothpick but said nothing. Yet Mr. Way, a veteran deli man and 30-year member of Local 342 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, saw assent in the man's eyes and began to heap sauerkraut atop a foot-long hot dog nestled in a bun.
2003-03-16	Let 100 Lots Sell: The Age of Mao Goes on the Block	ON a trip to Hong Kong in 1996, the New York rare book dealer Justin G. Schiller bought a blanket-size wool banner depicting Mao Zedong. ''It was very much like Andy Warhol's vivid image, but done in black and white,'' he recalled. He had long admired Warhol's Mao paintings but now realized that other images of Mao were also compelling. Mr. Schiller had collected Chinese artifacts from the Han and Tang dynasties for several years, but with one purchase he leapt a millenium to add a fantastic graphic 20th-century image of Mao to his trove.

Guggenheim Museum prepares for ''Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle,'' a major exhibition that includes his five-part film cycle along with related sculptures, photographs and drawings, it faces an unusual challenge.
2003-02-06	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Sotheby's Will Discontinue Auctions On Its Web Site	The auction house Sotheby's Holdings said that it would stop holding online auctions on its Web site, sothebys.ebay.com, which was built by and linked to eBay. The alliance between Sotheby's and eBay will end in May, officials said. ''As our online auctions offered by our dealer associates and Sotheby's have not generated a profit for Sotheby's, we are discontinuing separate online auctions,'' said William F. Ruprecht, president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. The company plans to continue operating a Web site, officials said, to provide details on its live auctions and for other company information. The auction house said that it had lost about $100 million on Internet operations in about three years. In June, Sotheby's started selling its fine art, antiques and other collectibles on the Web. But online sales did not meet company expectations; Sotheby's said it made about $135 million through its eBay-affiliated site.
2003-02-01	Michael Jackson Is Sued by Sotheby's	Sotheby's auction house filed suit yesterday against Michael Jackson's production company, saying the entertainer had refused to pay for two paintings worth more than $1.3 million that he had successfully bid for in October. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeks $1.68 million from Mr. Jackson's company, MJJ Productions, for the price of the paintings and various costs incurred by Sotheby's.
2003-01-31	Americana Sells Well, Considering	The Americana sales this month were remarkably strong, given the economy. Christie's auctions of important Americana, Pennsylvania German folk art, the Russell B. Aitken Collection of Decoys and the Benjamin F. Edwards III Collection of Chinese Imari Porcelain Part II, totaled $13.7 million (against an estimate of $9.2 million to $14.3 million). Sotheby's sales of Americana, including furniture, folk art, silver and early military accouterments, totaled $15.9 million. Those sales had been expected to bring $12.9 million to $18.9 million. ''The market is as resilient as ever,'' said John Hays, deputy chairman of Christie's. ''All the precincts were as strong as could be. What was encouraging was to see the number of private buyers participating. The trade was present, but the dealers had their horns pulled in.''
2003-01-12	The Relics of Wars Fought Long Ago	WILLIAM GUTHMAN remembers well the day in 1966 when he decided to leave his job in Manhattan to devote himself full time to his passion for early American military artifacts. As was his habit every Sunday, he rose early and drove from his home in Westport to New Haven, where pickers, the foot soldiers of the antiques trade, sold their treasures along State Street.
2003-01-05	Going Into Battle? Dress With Requisite Yankee Flair	WILLIAM H. GUTHMAN's 50-year search for the most striking artifacts of America's early militias -- eagle-emblazoned drums, brilliantly plumed hats, painted canvas knapsacks and boldly lettered canteens -- was spurred by a passionate interest in the regalia of war, the things men wore or carried into battle on this continent 200 years ago. Mr. Guthman, a childhood collector of frogs, butterflies and matchbox covers, began acquiring militia objects when he was a textile buyer for a dress manufacturer. To escape that world he browsed through flea markets, antiques fairs and gun shows on weekends.
2003-01-03	INSIDE ART	An Instinct For the Best Alice Manheim Kaplan insisted throughout her life that she wasn't really a collector -- that her purchases simply caught her eye. Yet until her death in 1995, she instinctively gravitated toward the finest art and objects spanning many centuries and many cultures. Now part of her collection has been dispersed to museums across the country.
2002-12-20	INSIDE ART	Whitney Plans Its 2004 Biennial It may seem as if the Whitney Museum of American Art's 2002 Biennial just ended, but curators are already starting to plan the next one. This week the museum's director, Maxwell L. Anderson, announced that Chrissie Iles, its curator of film and video; Shamim M. Momin, the director of its branch at Philip Morris; and Debra Singer, its associate curator of contemporary art, would together organize the next biennial, which opens in March 2004.
2002-12-18	COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Manhattan; Sotheby's Agrees to Sell Its Home, Then Lease It	Sotheby's, the financially troubled auction house, announced yesterday that it had agreed to sell its headquarters on York Avenue for $175 million and that it would lease the building from the new owner. Sotheby's said RFR Holding, the commercial real estate company that owns such landmarks as the Seagram Building and the Lever House, had agreed to buy the building and lease it to the company for up to 40 years.
2002-12-10	Front Row	An Uptown Girl Heads Downtown ''Sylvia Miles isn't here, so you know it has to be a tough night,'' said Jackie Rogers, scanning the crowd at her new boutique in the meatpacking district last Thursday. Ms. Miles, the actress and perennial party fixture and a pal of Ms. Rogers's, was indeed a no-show. But snow and gale-force winds did not keep dozens of other fans of the quintessentially uptown Ms. Rogers from thronging her opening at 34 Little West 12th Street. The 700-square-foot shop, with its red lacquered walls and hanging racks, looked like an installation, apt in a neighborhood that draws spillover crowds from the galleries a few blocks north. Pipes suspended from the ceiling displayed slinky made-to-order evening dresses and silk organza separates that retail for $450 to $2,500.
2002-12-06	Auctioning Teasers To the Next Potter Novel	The latest example of how Harry Potter aficionados -- even those of advanced age -- are hungering for any morsel about the next installment is a simple index card containing a mere 93 words scribbled in blue ink. The words are from the series' author, J. K. Rowling, and because they are clues to the fifth novel's contents, they have generated frenetic interest as an item to be auctioned by Sotheby's on Thursday in London. The way moviegoers eagerly awaited the release of early serials like ''The Perils of Pauline'' and readers were addicted to installments of Charles Dickens' ''Old Curiosity Shop,'' fans are anticipating ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' the next volume in the series. Speculation is particularly intense because Ms. Rowling failed to publish it as expected in July, having produced the previous four at a rate of one book a year. The last novel, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' was published in 2000, and the next is due sometime next year.
2002-12-06	INSIDE ART	A Lesser Rubens, At a Discount In this rocky economy, auction houses are frequently handling artworks that dealers have been trying to sell for years, but now at deeply discounted prices. One of them is ''The Holy Family With the Infant St. John the Baptist,'' a mature work by Rubens, painted around 1630, to be auctioned on Jan. 23 at Sotheby's in New York.
2002-12-06	A Genius With a Flair For Lamps	Asked for his most important piece of advice to young architects, Philip Johnson once famously remarked, ''First, get the client.'' He may have garnered this bit of wisdom from Frank Lloyd Wright, who is widely considered the most original American architect of the 20th century. A man of legendary charm, for more than 70 years Wright was able to win major commissions from oil barons, department store scions and wax company heirs, the kinds of people who could afford his grand visions. One of Wright's most important early clients was Susan Lawrence Dana, a beautiful, independent-minded woman from Springfield, Ill., who collected art and supported women's suffrage and racial integration.
2002-11-13	A Buyer's Market for Contemporary Art	Despite months of marketing and all the pre-sale chatter, by the end of Sotheby's auction of contemporary art last night one message came through at a high decibel level: the buyers, not the auction house or the sellers, set the prices. Throughout a nearly two-hour sale with healthy competition in all segments of contemporary art, collectors stayed where they thought the market should be. The sale was strong but failed to meet Sotheby's ambitious expectations: of the 66 works, 15 failed to find buyers. The sale totaled $78.2 million, below its $81.8 million low estimate.
2002-11-11	A Collector Is Selling 21 Treasures Out of 700	Thomas Weisel does not like the buzz. Although his name is nowhere in the auction catalog, since September, when Sotheby's announced it was selling $43.4 million to $60.7 million worth of primarily Abstract Expressionist art from ''A Private American Collection,'' everyone in the art world knew the seller was Mr. Weisel, a San Francisco investment banker. It did not take a detective to figure it out. Over the years he has lent many of his best pieces to museum exhibitions and allowed his name to be published in their catalogs.
2002-11-07	Picasso and Léger Bring Top Prices	A Picasso sculpture and a Léger painting that failed to sell at Sotheby's in 1995 brought the top prices at Christie's sale of Impressionist and modern art last night, indicating that tastes and fashions have changed significantly in seven years. Of the 54 lots, 40 found buyers. The sale totaled $67.5 million, below its $87 million low estimate.
2002-11-06	A Comeback of Sorts for Auction Prices	There were no fireworks at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art last night. Nor were there prolonged bidding wars or prices that brought gasps from the audience in the York Avenue salesroom. But to the market, the $81.4 million sale total was a welcome sign. ''Normal service resumed,'' said James Roundell, a London dealer, after the sale. ''I think you'll find a lot of people mightily relieved. There's a market as we know it.''
2002-10-31	Art and Anxiety; Economic Fears Cast Shadows Over Fall Auctions	When times get tough, art pours onto the market. Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg will offer more than $400 million of art in the November fine art sales in New York over the next two weeks, including works by masters like Picasso and Monet, Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. While the monetary total is not unusually high, the sheer number of works for sale this fall has increased. Some is being sold by people in financial distress, but many other sellers think this is the moment to cash in. The question is whether collectors will have the appetite, never mind the means, to buy.
2002-10-25	INSIDE ART	A Mantegna Is Available ''Descent Into Limbo,'' the last painting by the Italian Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna still in private hands and an image familiar to museumgoers, will be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York on Jan. 23. Painted around 1492 and measuring only about 15 by 16 inches, the work shows Jesus going down into limbo to liberate the souls of the righteous dead.
2002-10-11	ANTIQUES	Let Them Sit On Chaises American men often love fine French furniture. Thomas Jefferson may have been the first American collector. He liked French wine, philosophy, furniture and architecture. When Jefferson left his diplomatic post in Paris and returned to the United States in 1789, he sent home 86 crates of French furniture, porcelain, silver, paintings, prints and books. ''He had 48 French chairs,'' said Susan Stein, the curator at Monticello, Jefferson's Virginia estate. ''Jefferson's French furniture was elegant and sophisticated and added to the cosmopolitan character of Monticello.''
2002-10-02	OFF THE MENU	Ducasse Branching Out Early next year, Alain Ducasse plans to open Mix, a restaurant that will feature both American and European cuisines, at 68 West 58th Street, up the street from his Alain Ducasse restaurant in the Essex House. The check, with tax and tip, should be less than $100 a person, he said. His partner will be Jeffrey Chodorow, who owns the Tuscan Steak and China Grill restaurants. Changes Due at Tonic Gerry Hayden, who left as executive chef of Aureole earlier this year, is becoming a partner in the Tonic, 108-110 West 18th Street. Until the end of the year he will be the consulting chef, filling the void left by the departure of Joseph Fortunato, the Tonic's chef. Then the restaurant will close, Mr. Hayden said, reopening in February as Amuse, serving a menu of about 20 dishes in different size portions, from $5 to $20. Steve Tzolis, who owns the Tonic, will remain as Mr. Hayden's partner.
2002-09-27	INSIDE ART	Hand of Fate At Sotheby's With less and less top-quality American art coming on the market these days, auction houses have to rely more than ever on acts of fate, like death and divorce, to obtain the best property for sale. So the news that Sotheby's will auction two important American paintings and a group of American works on paper from the estate of Arthur G. Altschul, the Manhattan investment banker and philanthropist who died in March, is expected to generate a good deal of interest among serious collectors.
2002-09-13	INSIDE ART	New Masters Up for Sale It has been more than a decade since the last auction of mostly Abstract Expressionist paintings and drawings. Most of the great works by masters like Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky and Franz Kline are in museum collections.
2002-08-18	When Home Is a Castle And the Big House, Too	ON August evenings, the limestone canyons of Park Avenue and the white-glove streets of the East 70's are quiet, abandoned by the well-to-do for breezier destinations. The most telling sign of the exodus emerges after nightfall, when the buildings and town houses -- in other months honeycombed with light -- remain dark, their windows desolate black sockets, save for the rare flickering of a summer bachelor's television.

The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction-house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay.
2002-07-31	Terms Upheld In Auction Case	Thousands of clients of Sotheby's Holdings and Christie's International may start getting payments soon from a $512 million settlement of a price-fixing suit now that an appeals court has resolved a key issue, lawyers in the case said today. Sotheby's and Christie's agreed last year to pay $512 million to settle a suit on behalf of 130,000 clients who accused the two leading auction houses of inflating commissions. The clients have not collected any money because of a dispute over a provision of the pact. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the deal today.

Alfred Taubman, the former Sotheby's chairman, who was convicted of price fixing, will not get a new trial, a federal court of appeals ruled yesterday. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit also denied Mr. Taubman's request for release pending another appeal. Mr. Taubman was convicted in December of conspiring to fix commission fees and of swindling customers of more than $100 million. Mr. Taubman, 78, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $7.5 million. His lawyers describe him as being in frail health. He is scheduled to surrender to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., on Aug. 1 Hope Reeves (NYT)

The Bond Street salesroom burst into applause after eight bidders fought to buy the work, ''The Massacre of the Innocents'' (1609-1611), a large, biblically inspired painting depicting the massacre of newborn boys ordered by King Herod. Sam Fogg, a London manuscripts dealer, was the winning bidder. People in the salesroom said three dealers and one telephone bidder were willing to spend more than $55 million.

2002-06-27	Footlights	Go West (and South) What's new in Santa Fe, N.M., where the 46th season of the Santa Fe Opera opens tomorrow? The answer is four new opera productions, starting with Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' directed by Jonathan Miller, which begins the season. The others in the 37 performances through Aug. 24 are Rossini's ''Italian Girl in Algiers,'' Mozart's ''Clemenza di Tito'' and, in its American premiere, ''L'Amour de Loin,'' by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho. The lone revival is Verdi's ''Traviata.'' In his Santa Fe debut, Peter Sellars will direct ''L'Amour de Loin,'' as he did in its world premiere, at the Salzburg Festival in 2000; it opens on July 27 with Robert Spano conducting. Dawn Upshaw will again play the Countess Clémence, idealized by a princely troubador who fears to meet her lest reality spoil the ''love from afar'' evoked in the title. A Rodgers Century Tomorrow, 100 years to the day, Broadway will celebrate the birth of Richard Rodgers with ''Something Good,'' a free concert of his songs from shows like ''South Pacific,'' ''Carousel,'' ''Pal Joey'' and ''Oklahoma!'' Among those to take part in the concert, at noon at the Gershwin Theater, on 51st Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, are Barbara Cook, John Cullum, Marin Mazzie, Howard McGillin, Lea Salonga, Billy Stritch and the ''Oklahoma!'' chorus.
2002-06-20	A Little Kitsch For the Playboy Of the 21st Century	It's not too late to be a bachelor from the 1960's, and not just in your mind. Playboy Enterprises has consigned close to 10,000 items to Butterfields for auction in Los Angeles on Sunday, including club keys with a velvet drawstring bag; a rug, above, from the Playboy Clubs, which is expected to sell for $600 to $800; and a maquette of the logo, inset, which is expected to sell for $2,000 to $3,000. ''Playboy had such an impact on young men of that generation,'' said Peter Loughrey, the sale's director. ''Teaching bachelors how to be more sophisticated -- the best cars, the most stylish clothes, what kind of Scotch to drink, what kind of jazz to listen to.''

When you are looking at a timepiece you have to consider its use, its function and its place in history. You have to see whether it's mechanically important and 'right.' You have to be knowledgeable about what's inside.''
2002-05-31	Ireland Buys a Trove of Joyce Notebooks	In a sort of homecoming for this country's most famous exile, the National Library of Ireland has acquired a sprawling collection of manuscripts by James Joyce, including, in a total of some 700 pages in six notebooks, 16 drafts from ''Ulysses'' and typescripts and proofs of ''Finnegans Wake.'' Discovered two years ago, they were kept secret until today. As officials announced the purchase today in the library's airy rotunda -- frequented by a young Joyce as a student -- they still seemed stunned by the scale and quality of the find. The acquisition, for $11.7 million through Sotheby's in London, is the largest artistic purchase ever made by the Irish state, and is ''one of the most important cultural milestones for Ireland in living memory,'' Sile de Valera, the government arts minister, said. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern illustrated the significance of the purchase, and how Ireland values its artists, by greeting the suitcase of papers as it arrived at Dublin Airport yesterday. But in Joyce's time, the writer felt so unappreciated here he felt compelled to leave Ireland.

An hour earlier in Midtown, Morrell & Company's British wine auctioneer, David Molyneux-Berry, disposed of a bottle of 1966 Château Latour for $345 (including the 15 percent buyer's premium). A magnum of 1961 Dom Pérignon Champagne bottled for Earl Spencer and readied in 1981 to commemorate the marriage of his daughter, Lady Diana Spencer, to the Prince of Wales, went for $5,750. The sale took place, as usual, in the Grand Havana Room, a private cigar club on top of 666 Fifth Avenue.

But dealers in midcentury modernism are just the opposite: young, hip and earnest. The pathbreakers include Peter Loughrey, the director of the 20th-century furniture and decorative arts department at Butterfields in Los Angeles, which has recently bought Los Angeles Modern Auctions, and James Zemaitis, a 20th-century design expert at Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg in New York.

The sale totaled $42.5 million, above its low estimate of $35.9 million. Of the 60 works on offer, 51 sold. Prices were strong, but not as strong as the ones at Christie's contemporary-art sale on Tuesday night, which brought $46.9 million, just below its high estimate of $47 million with 67 out of 56 works selling.

Well, that's basically what is happening at Sotheby's in New York on May 17 and 18. Last July Sotheby's asked 140 well-known interior designers if they wanted to consign any antiques or items in inventory for a sale. The 50 who responded are now selling 710 lots, some commissioned for famous people like Yves Saint Laurent, others designed by 20th-century legends like Billy Baldwin, Van Day Truex, Renzo Mongiardino, André Arbus and Gio Ponti. ''The idea came on the heels of our Villa Fiorentina sale last year, which showed how much people love things with names attached,'' said Mary F.

2002-05-09	Art Sales Bring Strong Prices for a Second Night	Sotheby's held a strong sale of Impressionist and modern art last night, with a Cézanne still life bringing $16.7 million, a Degas pastel snapped up for $16.5 million and a Giacometti bust sold for $13.7 million. Yet the atmosphere there felt less buoyant than it did at Christie's sale the night before, even though Christie's results weren't as good. The evening totaled $126 million, right in the middle of its estimate of $107 million to $147 million, and only 3 of the 55 works up for sale failed to find buyers. Christie's auction of 46 works had totaled $97.6 million.

2002-04-20	Europe Says Art Auction Houses Fixed Prices	More than a year after American authorities found that the two largest art auction houses, Christie's International and Sotheby's Holdings Inc., had joined in an illegal price-fixing cartel, European antitrust officials leveled essentially the same charge in formal complaints sent to the two companies today. ''We have collected evidence that the two leading auction houses have colluded to fix commissions and on other aspects of the trade,'' the spokeswoman for the European Commission, Amelia Torres, said today in announcing the complaints, known as statements of objections.
2002-04-19	No Prison Time Is Recommended In Sotheby's Price-Fixing Case	The Federal Probation Department has recommended no prison time for A. Alfred Taubman, the 78-year-old principal owner of Sotheby's who faces sentencing on Monday on his conviction for fixing commission prices charged to auction sellers. But the Justice Department, which prosecuted Mr. Taubman, disputed the probation recommendation. Justice Department lawyers argued to the sentencing justice, George B. Daniels of Federal District Court in Manhattan, that Mr. Taubman deserved the maximum three-year prison term and a fine of $1.6 million to $8 million for leading a six-year antitrust conspiracy with the rival Christie's auction house. The scheme, which rocked the auction world and by some estimates led to overcharges of hundreds of millions of dollars, cost sellers $43 million as a result of the actions Mr. Taubman was convicted for, the government contends..
2002-04-19	INSIDE ART	Pop Whimsy All Over Town The whimsical work of the Pop artist Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, his wife and artistic partner, will be all over New York City this summer. The Whitney Museum of American Art was recently given 88 drawings by Mr. Oldenburg, including works done in collaboration with Ms. van Bruggen. The collection will be the subject of an exhibition at the Whitney from June 7 to Sept. 15.
2002-04-19	Unique Coin, and Unique Mystery; Back From a King's Vault, the Lone 1933 Double Eagle	It is a $20 gold piece from 1933 that was ordered destroyed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Stolen from the United States Mint, it was exported for a king after the government committed the bumble of all bumbles, was contested in an interminable legal donnybrook, and even came close to being lost in the destruction of the World Trade Center. It is the 1933 double eagle, and it could fetch a record price for any coin when it is auctioned in July for an estimated $4 million to $6 million.
2002-04-17	World Briefing | Europe: Britain: Waterlilies, At $21.5 Million	A Monet painting last seen in public in 1925 and never reproduced in literature in color is going on sale at Sotheby's in London in June with a price tag of $21.5 million. The painting, ''Nympheas,'' is from the French impressionist's ''Waterlilies'' series of 48 paintings of the garden pond of his house in Giverny. It was acquired directly from the artist by his dealer, Durand-Ruel, in 1910 and then sold to the grandfather of the present anonymous French owner in 1940, 14 years after the artist's death.

2002-04-10	For Drinking a Bellini With Cellini	They sure knew how to set a table 150 years ago. Elaborate silver candelabra, sauceboats, tureens and other adornments of baronial tables will go on display on Saturday at Sotheby's before being auctioned on April 18. The pieces include a silver-gilt wine barge adorned with images of Bacchus, above, from the collection of Jocelyne Wildenstein. It was designed to be rolled down a table holding decanters of port. Most of the pieces were made in the 19th century, but there is also tableware from the 17th to the 20th century. The exhibition will be on view at 1334 York Avenue (72nd Street) on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m.; and April 17 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
2002-04-09	Down From the Flagpole, Up in the Museum Gallery	Twenty years ago Thomas S. Connelly's wife, Daniele, wanted a 14th-century French tapestry to hang in their new vacation home in Colorado. He bought her an American flag instead. Hand sewn in 1876, it had 38 stars (Colorado was the 38th state) and was ''a beautiful work of art,'' he said. It also didn't hurt that it was a fraction of the cost of the tapestry.
2002-04-05	INSIDE ART	And Rosie's Still Riveting Just a month after the hugely successful traveling Norman Rockwell exhibition closed at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, one of the show's poster images has resurfaced. It will be used for auction advertisements and marketing brochures, and will be on the cover of a catalog. ''Rosie the Riveter,'' showing a patriotic defense worker clad in overalls and a work shirt with her sleeves rolled up to reveal immensely muscular arms, will be the star of Sotheby's American paintings sale on May 22. Rosie is posed pausing for lunch, with a riveting tool lying across her lap, her visor and goggles back on her head and a ham sandwich in her hand. She gazes into the distance while casually resting her penny loafers on a tattered copy of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf.'' Despite her masculine build and attire, however, Rosie's fingernails are painted red. So are her lips. Her bright red hair has a provocatively curly bob.
2002-03-21	Delay in Sotheby Case	The sentencing for A. Alfred Taubman, the former Sotheby's chairman who was found guilty in December of conspiring with Christie's, its rival auction house, to fix fees charged to sellers, has been postponed to April 22 from April 2. Mr. Taubman faces up to three years in prison and fines in the millions of dollars.
2002-03-20	Second Round Of Layoffs At Christie's	As part of an effort to make itself more profitable, Christie's International, the London-based auction house, made a second round of layoffs yesterday, eliminating 18 jobs in its New York operations, primarily in administrative positions. Since the beginning of last year, the company has decreased its staff almost 15 percent worldwide, to about 1,900 employees. Its rival, Sotheby's Holdings, cut more than 400 jobs over the last year.
2002-03-15	Bronze Art The Ancients Treasured	The talented artisans of ancient China were as valued as computer programmers are today. ''Over the millennia, especially during the Warring States period, whenever there was a conflict on China's outer or inner borders, all the captives were killed except for the artisans,'' said Robert Hatfield Ellsworth, the veteran New York dealer in Asian art. ''Skilled workmen were valued more highly than farmers, cattle or horses. After a battle, the conquerors took the time to sort it out, and the artisans knew they and their families would be saved. Weavers, jade cutters, bronze workers and woodcarvers were taken up, lock, stock and barrel, and shipped off to the state of the conqueror.'' As part of the weeklong celebration of Asian art in New York, Sotheby's is auctioning more than 150 of Mr. Ellsworth's Chinese archaic bronzes on Tuesday. (Viewing runs through Monday.) Discussing his bronzes, most of which fall between the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 B.C.) and the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618 to 906), he said, ''The capturing of these artisans explains the migration of design and thought in China.''
2002-03-15	Impressionist And Modern	Sotheby's has scored another impressive collection for its important evening sale of Impressionist and modern art on May 8, and this time the York Avenue auction house didn't have to offer the seller any financial incentives to close the deal. In addition to two significant consignments, Sotheby's is to auction 20 Impressionist and modern works from what the company will describe only as ''an important private collection.''
2002-03-14	A Ruling in Auction Houses' Case Is Reversed	A federal appeals court reversed a trial judge's decision yesterday and ordered additional consideration of a class-action lawsuit on behalf of auction house customers who contend that Sotheby's and Christie's colluded to fix fees charged to buyers and sellers in foreign transactions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan reversed a decision by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan who ruled that the transactions were beyond the jurisdiction of federal antitrust law. In a 31-page decision written by Justice Robert A. Katzmann, the appeals court returned the case, saying the lower court would have to decide whether the suit could be dismissed for other reasons, as the auction houses contend.
2002-03-13	Sotheby's Posts Smaller Losses	Sotheby's Holdings, the auction house, said yesterday that losses in the fourth quarter and 2001 had narrowed and that it expected to return to profitability this year. Its fourth-quarter loss fell to $400,000, or 1 cent a share, from $6.5 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier.
2002-03-11	Mendelssohn 'Hebrides' Manuscript To Be Sold	Sotheby's is to announce today in London that an important autograph manuscript by Felix Mendelssohn is being offered at auction. It is a complete 34-page revision of the concert overture ''The Hebrides,'' sometimes known as ''Fingal's Cave,'' which Mendelssohn's biographer Philip Radcliffe has called, ''beyond any doubt, his masterpiece.'' The score, from 1832, is said never to have been sold and thus to be the last major manuscript of Mendelssohn to appear on the market. He gave it to his friend and pupil William Sterndale Bennett in 1837, Sotheby's reports, and it passed by descent to its current owner, who has not been identified. The auction is to take place on May 17 in London, and Sotheby's projects a sale price of $700,000 to $1 million.

BARRY SCHLACHTUS, an optometrist in the Smith Haven Mall here, can correct your myopia and set you up with a nice pair of glasses. But he has no eye for art. Mr. Schlachtus has worked at the Sterling Optical shop for about 10 years, taking his lunch break in the food court more often than not. But he had no idea why it was called the Calder Court. And he never looked twice at the brightly painted sheet-metal sculpture on three spindly legs that soared nearly 26 feet toward the skylight.
2002-02-15	INSIDE ART	Frank Stella Makes a Gift Last week the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art announced that it had received a gift of six paintings by Frank Stella from Mary Margaret and Harry W. Anderson, Bay Area residents who are longtime supporters of the museum. In response to the couple's generosity, Mr. Stella decided to add a gift of his own, ''The Duel (Der Zweikampf) F'' (N #8). Completed in 2001, it was exhibited last year at the Paul Kasmin Gallery in Chelsea. ''I thought it was nice to give something from the present,'' Mr. Stella said. ''It brings the collection up to date.''
2002-02-08	INSIDE ART	Sotheby's Battles For the Best Art After coming in a distant third, after Christie's and Phillips, in the Impressionist and modern art sales last November, Sotheby's is going for broke as it prepares for the spring auctions. Determined to snag big collections away from the competition, it is offering guarantees, the undisclosed minimum sums that are promised to sellers regardless of a sale's outcome.
2002-02-08	The Prices Of Americana Stay Strong	Despite the recession, Sotheby's and Christie's had highly successful sales last month of Americana, which includes American furniture, folk art, silver and Chinese Export porcelain. Sotheby's had six single-owner auctions, raising a total of $27.3 million. Christie's had two sales, for a total of $12.5 million. Americana dealers also did well at the Winter Antiques Show. ''A huge amount of material was available so people came in from Maine, Texas, California and many places in between,'' said John B. A. Nye, the head of the American furniture department at Sotheby's. ''A lot of people didn't come to New York after Sept. 11. We gave them a reason to travel. There was pent-up demand, and things were priced to sell.''

2002-01-31	Old Masters Generate Mixed Results At Auctions	Prices paid for artists like van Dyck and Romney broke records, but some paintings that had been on the auction market a little too recently were bargains. Then there was a rare, early Turner that did not get a single bid. Such were the vagaries of the January sales of old master paintings in New York. ''We're not in the 1960's anymore,'' said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, who runs Christie's old master paintings department in New York. ''There's not been as much depth in the market as there once was, but in this round of sales there were still some really great things.''
2002-01-31	Technology Briefing | Internet: Sotheby's And Ebay Plan Venture	EBay and Sotheby's said they would join forces to create a new auction Web site that allows for live online auctions of items sold in Sotheby's showrooms. The site will be a newly designed version of Sothebys.com, into which will be folded eBay's Premier site, a section that focuses on expensive collectibles and requires users to put credit card numbers on file. EBay will build the new site and the company's auction technology will be used to manage the bidding and selling process, whether for live auctions or auctions that take place over a set number of days. By the summer, officials said, online users will be able to participate in some of Sotheby's auctions at the same time as those who are sitting in the auction halls. ''People will be able to see on their monitors, in real time, the action in the showroom,'' said David Redden, vice chairman of Sotheby's and chairman of Sotheby's.com. Officials would not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Lisa Guernsey (NYT)
2002-01-25	INSIDE ART	Choice Additions For the Met Despite sagging attendance and depressed revenues, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has made some important acquisitions, which its board approved last week. The broad list includes a statue of an Egyptian pharaoh from 713 to 664 B.C., a 12th-century reliquary cross, three old master drawings and a late-18th-century American gilt eagle. The array represents areas of the art market where first-rate objects can still be bought for prices that seem affordable compared with, say, Impressionist or modern paintings.
2002-01-18	INSIDE ART	Old Masters In Their Prime Collectors, dealers and auction house experts have been grumbling for years about the scarcity of exceptional old master paintings and drawings. In these tough times, when the economy is shaky and fewer collectors are traveling to New York for the big auctions, there seems to be less top-quality work than ever to offer hungry collectors. But experts are keeping an eye on two interesting works going on sale next Friday.
2002-01-18	A Bit Fancy For Go Fish	This week's sales of Americana have several outstanding lots, but probably none are showier than the pair of Charles-Honoré Lannuier American Empire-style card tables that Christie's is selling this afternoon. The tables, which retain their Lannuier labels and were included in the catalog for the Lannuier show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998, have winged female caryatid supports and paw feet. They have rosewood veneers, matching die-stamped brass borders on their aprons and gilded brass star-and-eagle mounts. They were made around 1815 for a Philadelphia merchant, George Harrison, and his wife, Sofia. Lannuier, a master cabinetmaker from Paris, worked in New York from 1803 to 1819. About 125 pieces of his furniture survive, including 28 tables with winged caryatids. He is known for giving a distinctive American edge to French-period styles.
2002-01-13	Folk Art Collectors: A Two-Family Legacy	JULIE AND SAMUEL M. PALLEY'S favorite pastime was going to American folk art exhibitions and auctions to view the paintings, furniture, weather vanes, quilts and firefighters' memorabilia that they collected over 25 years. But when it came to buying, they were highly secretive. On Aug. 6, 2000, they even stayed away from a sale at Northeast Auctions in Portsmouth, N.H., and bid through an agent on a rare 19th-century Pennsylvania-German artifact they were determined to buy. The competition was fierce for the prize they sought: a hinged fire board, one yard square, produced in the 1830's to screen a fireplace when not in use. It bears a painted scene of a hilly landscape of soaring poplars ge 13kimmand an elegant red-brick mansion, all outlined in white. When the hammer fell, the Palleys had bought the fire board for $256,000, more than four times what the auction house had expected it would bring, making it the costliest artwork the Palleys ever acquired.

2002-01-11	So Much More Than Just a Desk: A Home's Center	''In the 18th century, a secretary-bookcase was the nerve center of the home,'' said Leigh Keno, the dealer in American antiques. ''Everything valuable was kept there: cash, account books, receipts, treasured volumes. It was like a computer is to us today, but instead of a password, you opened it with a key.'' Mr. Keno, who on Thursday is inaugurating his new quarters in a town house at 127 East 69th Street in Manhattan, has seen some great desks since he went into business in 1986. But few can compare to one Sotheby's is offering on Jan. 19, from the collection of Lammot du Pont Copeland and his wife, Pamela. (It is on view through Thursday.) The Copeland secretary is a real showboat, a high-style 18th-century Philadelphia piece with all the bells and whistles.
2002-01-09	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Taubman To Seek New Trial	The former chairman of Sotheby's, A. Alfred Taubman, who was convicted last month of price fixing, is seeking a new trial. Mr. Taubman's lawyers say that the judge erred in his instructions to the jury. In court papers filed yesterday, the lawyers contend that Judge George B. Daniels of Federal District Court in Manhattan should have advised the jury that there was nothing inherently illegal in 12 private meetings between Mr. Taubman and his Christie's counterpart, Sir Anthony Tennant. Mr. Taubman, who was convicted of conspiring with Christie's to fix prices charged to auction house sellers, faces up to three years in prison and a fine at his sentencing, set for April 2.

Now that the collection has reached what its president, Frederick B. Henry, called critical mass, it has given about 275 works by 45 artists to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. The gift, worth about $6 million, art experts said, significantly augments the Guggenheim's permanent collection, especially in film, video, new media and installation art.

Chatwin, who met Just in Prague in 1967, speculated in his novel that the man he called Utz had arranged to have his precious Meissen porcelain figures destroyed after his death. In a 1992 movie version of the book, the man's housekeeper is seen smashing the tiny figures.
2001-12-13	Board Is Trying to Put Sotheby's on Block	Sotheby's board said yesterday that it was directing its executive committee to meet promptly with representatives of the Taubman family to discuss the possible sale of the company. A. Alfred Taubman, 76, the real estate developer and former Sotheby's chairman who is still its largest controlling shareholder, was found guilty last week of conspiring with the former chairman of Christie's, Sotheby's auction house archrival, to fix fees charged to sellers in a scheme that eliminated competitive choice and cost customers millions of dollars. He faces up to three years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced on April 2.
2001-12-09	Business; If a Name Is Tarnished, but Carved in Stone	VALETS were parking cars and assisting patients at the A. Alfred Taubman Health Care Center here last Wednesday when a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Mr. Taubman, principal owner of Sotheby's, in a price-fixing scheme. Just down a hill, University of Michigan students were entering the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Library to study for exams. Nearby, aspiring designers were completing end-of-term projects at the A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, perhaps the favorite project of Mr. Taubman, who has vowed to make the architecture college the nation's best.
2001-12-08	The High Cost of Collusion	On Wednesday, the jury in a Manhattan federal district courtroom convicted A. Alfred Taubman, the former head of the international auction house Sotheby's, for his part in a price-fixing scheme with his counterpart, Sir Anthony Tennant, at Christie's. In a handwritten memo, Sir Anthony, who lives in England and cannot be extradited, found a graceful, self-forgiving, but ultimately arrogant phrase for price-fixing. He called it ''intervening from on high.'' There was incontrovertible evidence that Mr. Taubman and Sir Anthony had met repeatedly to plan such interventions. The criminal foolishness of their price-fixing, in which Sotheby's and Christie's agreed to set commission fees and stop what had become a costly war to secure the patronage of wealthy buyers and sellers, was matched only by the business foolishness that made conspiracy seem like a plausible remedy to a troubled bottom line. The details of transactions presented in court, including questionable price guarantees to sellers and inexcusable loans to buyers, will prove embarrassing to both firms, whose books will look even worse when legal costs and hefty fines have been accounted for.
2001-12-07	Auction Houses Are Set Back By Conviction In Price-Fixing	When Sotheby's and Christie's first conspired in the mid-1990's to fix the commission rates charged to sellers at their auctions, they were reacting, at least in part, to a desperate financial situation. In the throes of fierce competition, both auction houses were hemorrhaging money by promising the sellers commission-free deals, multimillion dollar financing, black-tie parties, elaborate vanity catalogs and donations to their favorite charities.
2001-12-07	ANTIQUES	For an Appreciation Of Ancients' Skills Years ago when I was studying Greek archaeology at college, my professor, the renowned archaeologist Emily Vermeule, insisted that we participate in a studio as part of our art history classes. In the studio, we were asked to carve heads in geometric, archaic, classical and Hellenistic styles. We were given reproductions of simple ancient chisels. Instead of precious marble, we were offered salt licks, large white blocks of salt that are given to livestock to lick. Though I had little talent as a sculptor, the exercises were effective. The third or fourth time I knocked off the nose on a head -- one slip was all it took -- and had to begin anew I came to have greater appreciation for the Greek masters.
2001-12-06	Ex-Chief of Sotheby's Is Convicted of Price Fixing	A. Alfred Taubman, who dipped into a billion-dollar fortune from shopping centers to become principal owner of Sotheby's, was found guilty yesterday of conspiring with its rival, Christie's, to fix fees charged to auction house sellers. The price-fixing scheme, which violated federal antitrust law by eliminating competitive choice and costing customers millions of dollars, was admitted by both companies, but Mr. Taubman's role in the six-year collusion, starting in 1993, was the issue at his 16-day trial in federal district court in Manhattan. He faces up to three years in prison and fines in the millions of dollars at sentencing on April 2.
2001-12-05	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: No Sotheby's Verdict	The jury in the federal price-fixing trial of the former Sotheby's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, ended its first day of deliberations yesterday without a verdict. The eight men and four women sent out several notes requesting pieces of evidence. They also wanted to rehear Judge George B. Daniels's instructions on the antitrust law, under which Mr. Taubman is charged with conspiring with his counterpart at Christie's to set nonnegotiable fees for auction sellers. Ralph Blumenthal (NYT)
2001-12-04	Sotheby's Case Ends on Issue of Character	Summing up their cases in the criminal conspiracy trial of Sotheby's former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, the lead prosecutor portrayed him yesterday as a devious price fixer who cut an illegal deal with Christie's, the archrival auction house, while a defense lawyer called him the innocent dupe of a scheming deputy desperate to avoid prison. Deriding what he called ''the dumb, hungry Taubman story'' -- defense witnesses had testified that the defendant was more interested in what was for lunch than in the company's profits -- the prosecutor, John G. Greene of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said the evidence showed that Mr. Taubman conspired with his Christie's counterpart at 12 secret meetings in the mid-1990's. Mr. Greene asserted that he then directed the auction house's chief executive, now his main accuser at the trial, Diana D. Brooks, to carry out his orders to fix commission rates with her counterpart at Christie's in a scheme that cost customers millions.
2001-11-30	The Autonomy of Sotheby's Chief Is Scrutinized in Antitrust Case	A leading law firm, retained by Sotheby's in 1997 to investigate possible collusion in the auction industry, repeatedly questioned the company's chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, but not its chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, the lawyer who headed the inquiry acknowledged yesterday in the price-fixing trial of Mr. Taubman. As testimony ended and with the case set to go to the Manhattan federal court jury on Tuesday, the prosecution and defense sought to score final points, skirmishing over two mysterious loans of $240 million and $105 million that Ms. Brooks granted to unidentified Sotheby's art buyers. The loans, revealed in court, were disclosed under questioning by defense attorneys to show that Ms. Brooks had a domineering management style that disregarded her boss.

2001-11-29	Collusion Was Widely Disregarded, Says Witness for Sotheby's	What the government has presented as a flagrant collusion agreement between the leaders of Sotheby's and Christie's was widely disregarded by both auction houses, a defense witness testified yesterday in the price-fixing trial of the former Sotheby's chairman A. Alfred Taubman. The pact particularly seemed to crumble when both houses chased the multimillion-dollar business of clients like the high-profile estates of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Pamela C. Harriman and Alice Tully, evidence showed.
2001-11-28	In Auctions, Vive the Opened Market; Legal Changes Allow Sotheby's and Christie's to Hold First Sales on French Turf	As Sotheby's lives through the uncertainty of the price-fixing trial of its former chairman in New York, it can at least boast to be making history this week in Paris when it becomes the first foreign auction house to hold a public sale in France. Christie's, its main competitor, will follow suit next week, but it was stubborn campaigning by Sotheby's that broke the monopoly granted to French auctioneers by Henri II in 1556. For free marketeers, at least, the heroine in this battle is Laure de Beauvau Craon, the president of Sotheby's France, who as far back as 1993 began pressing the European Union to require France to enforce regional legislation on free competition.
2001-11-28	Witness Says Price-Fixing For Auctions Began Earlier	Two executives of Sotheby's and Christie's initiated their own scheme to fix rates for auction buyers as early as 1992, one of them reluctantly testified yesterday. Their collusion began a year before the government claims the two executives' bosses -- the supposedly rival chairmen of the two auction giants -- hatched their own top-level conspiracy to fix fees charged to auction sellers.
2001-11-27	Sotheby's Trial Witnesses Attest to Chief's Integrity	The defense case in the price-fixing trial of A. Alfred Taubman, the controlling shareholder and former chairman of Sotheby's, took shape yesterday with testimony from friendly witnesses who vouched for his integrity and disputed his main accuser and longtime chief executive, Diana D. Brooks. One defense witness, Donaldson Pillsbury, Sotheby's in-house counsel, put a different spin on a damaging account Ms. Brooks had provided of a meeting between her and Mr. Taubman as the collusion between Sotheby's and its rival Christie's began to unravel in February 2000. Ms. Brooks had said Mr. Taubman pointed to a newspaper photo of her and said, ''You'll look good in stripes.''
2001-11-22	Reporter's Notebook; Prosecution Rests in Sotheby's Conspiracy Trial	And on the ninth day, the government rested. After a final effort to leave the jury in Manhattan federal court with a favorable opinion of their star witness in the price-fixing trial of A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's auction house, prosecutors completed the presentation of their evidence yesterday and turned the case over to the defense for what is expected to be a final week of testimony. The witness, Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's former chief executive, has pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and admitted working to execute a scheme with the rival Christie's house to raise commission fees charged to sellers and set them identically so customers could not bargain down prices. While awaiting sentencing, she agreed to cooperate with the government, and in dramatic testimony said that she acted on Mr. Taubman's orders.
2001-11-21	Conspiracy Trial Questions Honesty of Ex-Sotheby's Chief	Diana D. Brooks, the former Sotheby's chief executive who has testified that her longtime boss, A. Alfred Taubman, hatched a lucrative price-fixing plot with his counterpart at Christie's auction house, admitted under cross-examination yesterday that she had repeatedly lied to conceal her own willing role. But in a second and sometimes defiant day on the witness stand in Mr. Taubman's antitrust trial in federal court in Manhattan, Ms. Brooks, 51, said she was telling the truth when she swore she was carrying out Mr. Taubman's orders in furthering the scheme, which cost customers of both houses tens of millions of dollars since 1995. She has pleaded guilty to colluding with the chief executive of Christie's to set up a joint schedule of higher non-negotiable fees and coordinate other business practices to curb competition and boost lagging profits.
2001-11-20	Chief Witness Accuses Former Boss at Sotheby's	The central witness in the price-fixing trial of A. Alfred Taubman of Sotheby's -- his former chief executive, Diana D. Brooks -- took the stand for the first time yesterday and testified that Mr. Taubman drafted her for a conspiracy with archrival Christie's that he sought to conceal until the very end. It was the most dramatic confrontation to date in the seven-day-old trial in federal court in Manhattan -- the two former partners at the top of one of the world's auction giants pointing fingers at each other in one of the art world's biggest scandals.
2001-11-16	Christie's Ex-Executive Admits Cover-Up of Price-Fixing	The former auction house executive who testified this week that the chairman of Sotheby's was behind a giant price-fixing scandal admitted under cross-examination yesterday that he had long helped cover up the scheme by falsely denying its existence to investigators, investors, company directors and lawyers. Hammered again and again as a liar by a lawyer for A. Alfred Taubman, the former Sotheby's chairman, the witness, Christopher M. Davidge, who had been chief executive of archrival Christie's also testified that although Christie's knew he had lied, it stuck by a deal to pay him $8 million in severance payments and added other lucrative benefits to enlist him in its successful effort to win amnesty from prosecution.
2001-11-15	Ex-Executive of Christie's Tells of Collusion Scheme	A onetime printer who aspired to the heights of London society as chief executive of Christie's auction house testified yesterday that the former chairmen of Christie's and Sotheby's masterminded a scheme to squelch competition and boost profits and deployed him and a high-level Sotheby's deputy to carry it out. The illegal cooperation became so close, testified the former Christie's executive, Christopher M. Davidge, that the two supposedly rival companies set matching fees, exchanged confidential lists of clients and deal terms, and promised not to raid each other's employees. The collusion saved the two companies up to $33 million a year, he said.
2001-11-15	High Energy and Prices At Contemporary-Art Sale	Tried and true American artists like Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns and Ellsworth Kelly are exactly what collectors want right now. And that's exactly what Sotheby's was offering last night at its sale of contemporary art. ''Our deadline coincided with the tragedy of Sept. 11,'' said Tobias Meyer, head of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide and the evening's auctioneer. ''These events accelerated a movement we'd been seeing for several months toward serious art. This market is about what is safe and it's understood.''
2001-11-14	Taubman Datebooks Cited In Sotheby's Collusion Trial	He was listed as an unnamed ''gentleman.'' He was also listed as ''Sir A,'' ''Anthony,'' and ''Tony.'' Once he was mentioned by no name or word at all, just four asterisks. And other times he was named in full: Sir Anthony Tennant. By any number of different references, Sir Anthony, the former chairman of Christie's auction house, turned up in the datebooks and appointment schedules of his counterpart and ostensible rival at Sotheby's, A. Alfred Taubman, at least a dozen times from 1993 to 1996, according to evidence offered by the government yesterday at Mr. Taubman's price-fixing trial in federal court in Manhattan. The notations recorded a string of private meetings at which prosecutors contend they plotted a scheme to bilk their customers out of hundreds of millions of dollars.
2001-11-12	Reporter's Notebook; At Auction Trial, a Cameo for a Johns Painting	It did not take long at the price-fixing trial of A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's auction house, for the first important painting to get a mention. The painting was Jasper Johns's seminal ''Highway,'' a bright red, blue and yellow abstract work from 1959. In his opening statement, Mr. Taubman's lawyer, Robert B. Fiske Jr., argued that its failure to sell at auction at Sotheby's in 1994 provided motivation for someone other than Mr. Taubman -- namely the chief witness against him -- to concoct and run the multimillion-dollar scheme that Mr. Taubman is accused of masterminding with the onetime chairman of Christie's, Sir Anthony Tennant.
2001-11-10	Sotheby's Chief Said to Have Met Secretly With Rival	Declaring that ''the price fix was in, for hundreds of millions of dollars,'' federal prosecctors yesterday opened their criminal antitrust case against A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman and largest stockholder of Sotheby's auction house, charging for the first time that he and his counterpart at Christie's held a series of secret face-to-face meetings in New York and London to stifle their customers' ability to bargain between them. The defense, in its opening statement in Mr. Taubman's trial before Federal District Judge George B. Daniels in Manhattan, acknowledged the private meetings with Sir Anthony Tennant, former chairman of Christie's, but portrayed them as ''perfectly appropriate'' discussions of mutual concerns.
2001-11-09	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: 7 Jurors Picked For Sotheby's Case	Five men and two women were chosen yesterday as the first seven jurors in the criminal antitrust trial of A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman and largest stockholder of Sotheby's, the auction house. The jurors include a health care aide, a transit worker, a restaurateur and a former prison guard in Puerto Rico. Judge George B. Daniels of United States District Court said he expected to seat the remaining five jurors and at least three alternates today. The judge said the trial, which involves charges that Sotheby's conspired to fix prices with a rival auction house, Christie's, to fix art prices, might take a month. Ralph Blumenthal (NYT)
2001-11-08	Small Sale At Sotheby's Cools Fever Of Bidders	After overheated auctions at Phillips and Christie's this week, reality bit last night at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art. The small sale -- just 38 works -- was a somber affair in comparison with the sales on Monday and Tuesday nights, when paintings, sculptures and drawings from private collections had excited buyers who vied to outbid one another and paid top prices, often breaking records. Sotheby's sale totaled $33.1 million, below its low estimate of $38 million. Thirteen of the works, or 34 percent, failed to sell.
2001-11-08	Trial Beginning For Ex-Chairman In Sotheby's Case	Four years after federal prosecutors began peeling back layers of secrecy in the global art market, eventually exposing a huge price-fixing scheme at the world's two dominant auction houses, a final phase begins today in a Manhattan federal courtroom, where one of the most powerful figures in the art world goes on trial on charges of antitrust conspiracy. With his former deputy having pleaded guilty and poised to testify against him, A. Alfred Taubman, 76, the former chairman of Sotheby's and still the company's largest shareholder, is accused of colluding with his onetime counterpart at Christie's over five years to fix commissions charged to auction customers. His counterpart, Sir Anthony Tennant, a former chairman of Christie's, was indicted on the same charges as Mr. Taubman, but he has declined to leave his home in England to face prosecution and for technical reasons could not be extradited. He has denied wrongdoing.
2001-11-07	Understated and a Bit Underground	BID almost asks to be overlooked. It's half a floor below street level in Sotheby's forbidding Lubyanka of a building, which is itself in an isolated pocket of the Upper East Side, where streets come to a dead end and the neighborhood tone is defined by two enormous hospital complexes. The restaurant looks at first glance like the dining room of the best hotel in Cedar Rapids, and there were evenings, as the suave tones of Dean Martin flowed over the beige-on-beige surroundings, when I felt transported, in the strangest way, to an easy-listening land of bland.

2001-11-01	Anxiety Infuses November Art Sales	Christie's offices in Europe began getting panicked telephone calls two weeks ago from alarmed collectors who had received envelopes from Christie's in New York containing a mysterious white powder. A woman from Lausanne, Switzerland, was so concerned she called the police. It turned out that the substance was crushed hard candy attached to a promotional announcement of Christie's contemporary art sale. The mailer featured one of the star works, an installation piece by the Cuban-born artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres composed of 325 pounds of candy, the pieces individually wrapped in blue cellophane.
2001-10-20	Judge Denies Move to Bar Testimony in Auction Trial	A federal judge in Manhattan denied a request yesterday by A. Alfred Taubman, the indicted former chairman of Sotheby's auction house, to bar the appearance of a witness expected to offer crucial testimony against Mr. Taubman in his criminal antitrust trial next month. Robert B. Fiske Jr., one of Mr. Taubman's lawyers, argued in federal district court that an $8 million severance payment made by Sotheby's rival, Christie's, to Christopher M. Davidge, its former chief executive, was in effect a payment for his testimony. Mr. Fiske contended that the payment was contingent on Mr. Davidge's providing testimony in the case, and was made with the knowledge of prosecutors. Christie's is cooperating with federal investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
2001-10-17	Stranger Than Chatwin's Fiction	At the end of ''Utz,'' Bruce Chatwin's novel about a reclusive Czech collector of Meissen porcelain, the narrator speculates that the man destroyed the collection before his death to keep it out of Communist hands. In the 1992 screen version of the book, also called ''Utz,'' the collector's housekeeper is shown smashing hundreds of intricate rococo figures as the dying Utz observes her with a satisfied smile. But in truth the collection lived on, the real collection, that is.
2001-10-12	Sotheby's And Christie's Plan Layoffs Worldwide	Bracing for a period of unpredictable sales and revenue, Sotheby's and Christie's announced significant layoffs in their worldwide staffs this week. The reason for the cutbacks, officials at the world's largest auction houses said, has more to do with profitability in the current economic downturn, although the cost of the Justice Department investigation into price-fixing between the two companies and the coming antitrust trial for Sotheby's former chairman have clearly hurt their bottom lines.
2001-10-12	INSIDE ART	Alternative To Public Sales The Sept. 11 attack and its aftermath are having an effect on the way some collectors are choosing to sell their art. Two important paintings that were to have been in Sotheby's Nov. 7 auction of Impressionist and modern art in New York have been withdrawn from the sale. The works -- ''Mary Cassatt at the Louvre'' (1879) by Degas and ''Tahitian Women Near the Palms'' (1891) by Gauguin -- will now be sold by Sotheby's privately. For years both Sotheby's and Christie's have been quietly offering clients an alternative to auctions. Acting like dealers, the auction houses use their international contacts to offer art to collectors they think would be interested. Also like dealers the auction houses collect a fee for making the sale.
2001-10-05	DINER'S JOURNAL	The tersely named, semisubterranean Bid provides customers at Sotheby's two things they need desperately, real food and prices that cannot be changed with the wave of a paddle. Bid's location, off the main entrance of the auction house and a few steps down, imparts a hybrid atmosphere. The restaurant feels a little like an executive canteen, a little like the best restaurant in a major museum. The décor is soothing beige on beige, with steel light fixtures straight out of Flash Gordon. Matthew Seeber, formerly of Gramercy Tavern and Tabla, has devised a modern American menu that revels in strong, simple flavors. His approach is streamlined, with not too many ideas crowding any one dish. A tartare of bluefin tuna breaks the mold with sea urchin vinaigrette and shavings of bottarga, or pressed, dried mullet roe.
2001-10-02	2 Auction Officials to Figure in Trial of Sotheby's Ex-Chief	Two prominent auction house officials who have not been publicly linked to the scandal involving Sotheby's and Christie's have emerged as figures in pretrial jockeying in the criminal antitrust case against A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's. Mr. Taubman's trial, which has been postponed until Nov. 5, is the sole remaining criminal action in the huge scandal in which the two companies illegally colluded to fix commission fees charged to thousands of customers over several years in the 1990's.
2001-09-25	Defense Is Trying to Bar Witness in Auction Trial	The lawyers for A. Alfred Taubman, a former chairman of Sotheby's, asked a Federal District Court judge in Manhattan yesterday to bar the appearance of a witness expected to offer crucial testimony against him in his criminal antitrust trial. They argued that prosecutors had violated professional ethics rules in their dealings over the cooperation of the witness, Christopher M. Davidge, the former chief executive of the rival Christie's auction house, which illegally fixed commission rates with Sotheby's on hundreds of millions of dollars of merchandise through several years in the 1990's.
2001-09-14	Museums' Windfall	The Annenberg Foundation has announced $45 million in grants in the last week to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Walter H.

Mrs. Annenberg has been a trustee of the Philadelphia Museum since 1954, and both the Annenbergs have been trustees of the Met on and off since 1974.
2001-09-14	Old Motorcycles Take the Stage	AFTER years in the shadows of collector cars, vintage motorcycles are getting their place in the sun. Two years after the first North American auction of vintage and high-performance motorcycles, Sotheby's is back for a second round tomorrow in Chicago. And the Guggenheim Museum will open its Las Vegas branch next month with a reprise of its most successful exhibition ever, the Art of the Motorcycle. The auction, to take place at Sotheby's Chicago showroom, will include rare bicycles and memorabilia. One highlight will be the 1951 Triumph Thunderbird once owned by Steve McQueen. But the real star of the show is expected to be a rare 1912 Sears Dreadnought V-twin that was sold through the Sears, Roebuck catalog of 1912-16. The original and unrestored Sears, manufactured by the F. W. Spacke Machine Company of Indianapolis, has a nine-horsepower engine, a suspended seat and a regular bicycle chain and pedals -- so that one could ride it without the engine running. Sotheby's said it expected the Sears, offered with the original catalog and other literature, to bring $110,000 or more.

The warmly modern downstairs room, owned and run by Tentation, Potel & Chabot, displays art to be auctioned. It is open daily for dinner, and offers Matthew Seeber's seasonally garnished roasted meats and fish. It will start serving lunch soon.

2001-08-18	Sotheby's Ex-Chief Previews His Defense	Lawyers for A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's chief shareholder and former chairman, yesterday outlined central elements of the defense he is expected to make against charges that he colluded with a counterpart at Christie's to fix commission rates governing tens of thousands of transactions. During pre-trial motions in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the lawyers contended there was strong evidence that an earlier round of price-fixing discussions had been engineered by subordinates at the two auction houses without his involvement. They maintain that the scheme for which Mr. Taubman is being prosecuted was similar and that he was not, as the government charges, one of its instigators.
2001-08-03	Garden Variety Sculpture	With its sculpture garden now a construction site, the Museum of Modern Art plans to exhibit 15 of its most popular sculptures at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.

2001-07-11	Auction Case Takes Turn To Documents	In the continuing legal battles involving Christie's and Sotheby's, a storm has erupted over four confidential documents from Christie's that have mistakenly wound up in the hands of lawyers for A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's who is facing criminal antitrust charges. The case is part of the long investigation into price-fixing by the two auction houses. The documents slipped though a screening of more than a million pages of internal records gathered by Christie's. They include an e-mail message specifying conditions under which Christopher M. Davidge, the former chief executive of Christie's, would cooperate with the Justice Department and also with the auction house in its efforts to win amnesty in the antitrust case.
2001-06-22	Manager And Collector	At the same time there were all those Andy Warhol sightings at flea markets, antiques shops and rummage sales in the 1970's and 80's, Frederick W. Hughes, Warhol's business manager for 25 years, was doing his own shopping. Even suffering from multiple sclerosis, he managed to ferret out obscure shops, wake up at dawn for the best selection at flea markets or be the first at antiques shows in London, Paris and New York. He bought important pieces of 18th-century English furniture, contemporary drawings, American Indian headdresses, skeletons of bats under glass, Mickey Mouse toys and Duke and Duchess of Windsor memorabilia.
2001-06-17	Court Filing Challenges Amnesty for Christie's	When charges of collusion between Sotheby's and its archrival Christie's first surfaced in 1997, top officials at Christie's repeatedly denied to lawyers that the company had hired to conduct an internal investigation that any improper conduct had taken place, according to court papers quoting a confidential report to the European Commission. Only after repeated questioning based on new information three years later did the chief executive of Christie's turn over a trove of secret documents that became a road map to the collusion between the two companies, the papers say. The documents have become crucial evidence in a major antitrust case, and were central to a recent $512 million civil settlement ending a lawsuit filed by more than 130,000 customers who say they were cheated as a result of price-fixing between the companies.

The book, ''Looking Forward,'' includes such auction house maxims as ''We continue to astound the world''; ''As the face of the client changes, so do we, or we will have no clients''; ''Success is one extra bid per lot''; and ''Antitrust must not distract us from our challenges.'' Tucked neatly in a pouch in the back of the book is a CD-ROM that shows an abbreviated version of the live presentations.
2001-05-25	Memos Point to Ties Between Auction Houses	Handwritten memos at the center of the collusion case of Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses suggest that the companies secretly altered time-honored and costly inducements used to attract sellers. Acting together, they dropped low-interest loans, ceased making donations to sellers' favorite charities and devised a system to increase their profits when art sold above a guaranteed minimum, according to the documents. The documents also indicate that the houses devised other ways to cooperate behind the scenes by, among other things, not poaching each other's employees, not bragging about how much business they brought in, and not speaking ill of each other in public or in front of clients.
2001-05-20	That Cool, That Suit: Sotheby's 007	I WAS so nervous that my mouth dried up completely and I was unable to speak,'' Tobias Meyer said, recalling the terror of conducting his first auction eight years ago during his first week on the job at Sotheby's in London. ''I had to say, '13,000' and I couldn't. There was a glass of water on the rostrum and I was shaking so much I couldn't pick it up.'' At Sotheby's in New York over the last two weeks, Mr. Meyer appeared formidably suave, poised and confident, as he auctioned off a Jackson Pollock for $7.9 million at a packed sale of contemporary art on Tuesday night, and a Francis Bacon triptych for a record $8.58 million the week before. So, it is hard to imagine him as a quivering wreck.
2001-05-17	A Giver of Parties That a Set Jetted In For	WHEN Mary Wells Lawrence was 12 and growing up in the small town of Poland, Ohio, she had a recurring dream about an imposing white house perched on a cliff above the sea. ''Believe me, I knew nothing of big houses or oceans when I was 12,'' she said. She had forgotten the dream until she came to the Côte d'Azur, in the south of France, some 25 years later as a successful advertising executive. She was there, oddly enough, to film television commercials for Betty Crocker casseroles. ''We named the various casseroles after mouthwatering places in Europe,'' Mrs. Lawrence said. ''One of them was the Riviera.''
2001-05-16	From Pollock to Koons, a Strong Sale at Sotheby's	The predictable superstars of the contemporary-art world -- personalities like Jeff Koons and Gerhard Richter, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol -- helped produce a strong sale last night at Sotheby's. The giant auction, which featured everything from first-rate Abstract Expressionist paintings to Pop art to pieces by trendy stars of the 1980's and 1990's, brought solid prices. But works by some artists who had been over represented in the market in recent years died as soon as they came on the block. Of the 70 works, 17 failed to sell. The sale totaled $45.3 million, right in the middle of its estimate of $35 million to $53 million.

Six bidders were still in the running at $7 million, and the portrait -- one of the last great German Expressionist paintings in private hands -- was bought by Richard Feigen, a Manhattan dealer, bidding on behalf of the Neue Galerie, a museum devoted to German and Austrian fine and decorative arts. Sotheby's said last night that Mr. Feigen was bidding for the museum, soon to open at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street, and an an anonymous collector.

2001-05-05	Sotheby's Ex-Chief Pleads Not Guilty	A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's, pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday to charges that he and Sir Anthony Tennant, his onetime counterpart at Christie's, colluded to fix the commission fees charged to auction house customers over a six-year period in the 1990's. Mr. Taubman, 76, and Sir Anthony, 71, were indicted on antitrust charges Wednesday. Sir Anthony, who lives in Britain and like Mr. Taubman has proclaimed his innocence, has said that he will not take part in the trial and would have to be extradited to appear. Because of disparities between American and British law, that possibility is considered remote, but Judge George B. Daniels of the Federal District Court issued a bench warrant yesterday for his arrest.
2001-05-04	Auction House Indictments Focus on the U.S. Executive	By indicting the two former chairmen of the world's most powerful auction houses on Wednesday, prosecutors are poised to build a case against A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's who is also its largest shareholder. Mr. Taubman, along with Sir Anthony Tennant, the onetime chairman of Christie's, are charged with organizing a scheme to fix the fees charged to about 130,000 customers. Mr. Taubman is an American citizen, and in this country, antitrust violations, which he is accused of, are a criminal offense. But even though prosecutors think Sir Anthony is guilty of a crime, his British citizenship will make it nearly impossible to extradite him as long as he remains in Britain because price fixing is not a criminal offense there. Only companies, not individuals, can be prosecuted on antitrust charges.

Alfred Taubman, former chairman of Sotheby's, and Sir Anthony Tennant, his one-time counterpart at Christie's, were indicted yesterday on federal antitrust charges stemming from a conspiracy in which the two giant auction houses fixed commission fees charged to more than 130,000 customers over six years. The indictment by a grand jury in Manhattan came as the huge spring art auction season was set to begin in New York next week. It said that the men were the masterminds of a scheme that involved fixing fees to sellers of fine art, jewelry and furniture and trading information that virtually nullified the bargaining power of customers in the $4 billion worldwide auction market.
2001-05-02	Sales and Unease Ahead, Auction Houses Seek Buyers	With their sleek new headquarters, glossy catalogs and aggressive advertising campaigns, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips appear to be pillars of strength and prosperity. But as their twice-yearly evening sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art begin in Manhattan next week, the mood within could best be described as jittery. Among them these three auction houses are to offer more than $600 million worth of art, a considerable sum given the rocky economy and the auction business's dependence on the mood of buyers whose split-second decision -- whether to bid as high as $30 million on a Picasso portrait of his first wife, Olga, or $45 million on a Cézanne or $10 million on a self-portrait by Max Beckmann -- determines the stability of the market.

And as a child she was only dimly aware of Mrs. Hargreaves's singular place in children's literature, as the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass.'' ''I knew about it, and who she was, but it was never considered something special, to be Alice Liddell's granddaughter,'' Mrs. St. Clair, 69, said recently. ''There was a bookcase in the living room with all the Alice volumes in it, and my father never really talked about it much. I was in my early 20's when he died. If he had lived longer, he might have gotten around to it.''

As the head of a multimillion-dollar fashion empire, a designer whose clothes helped frame the tastes of a decade and an adman with few equals, Gianni Versace was often depicted as protean. Certainly his appetites and budget were outsized. But behind the energetic self-publicizing that inspired reporters to compare him to everyone from Jay Gatsby to Julius Caesar was a man who prized comfort and coveted art treasures of the sentimental academic kind.

Under its terms, Bonaparte abdicated, renounced his claim to conquered lands and was sent into exile on the tiny island of Elba. About 10 copies of the treaty were made for the signers and their national archives. One copy -- in French on woven paper, with red wax seals and a flourish of green silk cord -- remained in the French National Archives in Paris for nearly 175 years. Then, in 1988, it vanished along with 4 ratification documents and 30 letters by Louis XVIII of France.

Under the proposed settlement, which the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court, conditionally approved last month, members of this so-called mixed class would be compensated only for auctions that took place in the United States and would give up their right to sue in the United States for transactions that took place overseas.

2001-03-15	Sotheby's Posts 4th-Quarter Loss and a Drop of 14% in 2000 Sales	Sotheby's Holdings, the auction house staggered by a price-fixing scandal, posted a fourth-quarter loss yesterday and said its auction sales for all of 2000 declined 14 percent. Its big rival, Christie's, announced that its auction sales rose 12 percent. The two houses have been embroiled in a continuing federal antitrust investigation. Sotheby's reported yesterday that fines, settlement costs of a civil suit and legal fees related to the investigation cost it $203.1 million last year.

Kravis, who is a board member, not incidentally, of Sotheby's auction house. Mr. Kravis has decided to sell the Renoirs, valued together at $18 million to $24 million, but the paintings are not being offered through Sotheby's. Instead they are being sold through the house's newest competitor, Phillips.
2001-02-24	Judge Rejects Most Claims By Law Firms in Auction Suit	A federal judge yesterday threw out the claims of 43 of 46 law firms seeking fees for preliminary work on the class action lawsuit by buyers and sellers against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses. In accepting claims for fees by the three firms, the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, cut one by 20 percent and refused to grant any of the three a bonus, called a multiplier, for supposedly preparing the way for the large settlement achieved by the firm that eventually led the case. That firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, was awarded nearly $27 million by Judge Kaplan on Thursday for winning a $512 million settlement for customers of Sotheby's and Christie's.
2001-02-23	Judge Approves Auction House Settlement	A federal judge gave final approval yesterday to a $512 million settlement of the lawsuit against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses by customers who said they were cheated in a price-fixing conspiracy that lasted several years. While attaching two conditions to the approval, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, in a 44-page decision, called the settlement ''eminently reasonable by any standard.''

2001-02-18	Style; The Great Gianni	The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names. The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute.
2001-02-17	FEDERAL JUDGE APPROVES SOTHEBY'S SETTLEMENT	A federal judge gave final approval yesterday to a $70 million class action settlement between Sotheby's and shareholders who sued the auction house claiming that antitrust violations still under federal investigation damaged the company and depressed its stock price. The judge, Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York, approved the agreement, which awards shareholders $30 million in cash, paid by A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman and controlling shareholder, and $40 million in company-issued Class A stock. The settlement will become final in 30 days if no appeal is filed. Judge Cote also reduced the fee of the plaintiff's lawyer, Berger & Montague of Philadelphia, to $1.25 million, from $10.5 million. Ralph Blumenthal
2014-01-02	INSIDE ART	Whitney Again Looks for Space It has been 16 years since the uproar over a postmodern design by the Princeton architect Michael Graves that would have radically altered the facade of the Whitney Museum of American Art's Marcel Breuer building on Madison Avenue. So violent was the criticism from neighborhood and civic groups that the museum finally abandoned the $37.5 million, 134,000-square-foot design.
2001-02-12	Experts Support Settlement Of Auction House Lawsuit	Economics experts have endorsed a $512 million class action settlement by Christie's and Sotheby's, court papers filed late Friday showed. Their report is a major step toward final court approval of the antitrust lawsuit brought last year by more than 130,000 auction house customers who said they were cheated in a price-fixing scheme dating from 1992. The structure of the settlement, the experts concluded, would help stave off insolvency for both companies, especially the publicly held Sotheby's, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange. They calculated the chance of a default by Sotheby's over the next five years at 9.16 percent, a probability that would more than double if the company's bonds, now rated at junk status, were downgraded further.
2001-02-12	A Usually Quiet Collector Plans Another Noisy Sale	Despite the public spectacle art auctions have become, there are still some buyers whose names are little known and whose collections are seen by only a select few. Eight years ago the name Stanley J. Seeger was seldom heard in the art world. An American heir to a family fortune from lumber, petroleum and other sources who was living in England, he was one of those quiet collectors who buy millions of dollars worth of art at auction while managing to keep low profiles.
2001-02-09	Judge Rules That Sotheby's Handled '98 Auction Properly	A federal judge here rejected accusations today that Sotheby's botched the 1998 auction of a large collection of Spanish colonial antiques owned by an art dealer in Santa Fe, N.M. The judge, C. LeRoy Hansen of Federal District Court, found that Sotheby's properly handled the sale of a 250-lot collection of Spanish colonial furniture, religious artifacts and American Indian pottery owned by the art dealer, Al Luckett Jr.
2001-02-05	Sotheby's Guilty Plea Brings Collusion Case Closer to End	With a federal judge's acceptance on Friday of a plea deal in which the auction house Sotheby's admitted its guilt in a price-fixing conspiracy and agreed to pay a $45 million fine, the Justice Department investigation and the civil suits that have stemmed from the case are ending. But even as lawyers begin winding down their work, questions remain, particularly in the criminal investigation, about the collusion between Sotheby's and its competitor, Christie's. The most prominent is whether A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman and the company's controlling shareholder, will face an indictment stemming from the collusion, which involved fixing commission rates paid by many customers through much of the 90's.
2001-02-03	Court Accepts Sotheby's Guilty Plea in Price Fixing	A federal judge accepted a guilty plea yesterday by Sotheby's to price fixing and collusion with its competitor Christie's and approved a $45 million fine that the auction house had agreed to pay in a plea agreement with prosecutors. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, said yesterday during a three-and-a-half-hour hearing that while the fine was $8.6 million below the minimum established by sentencing guidelines, he would approve it because Sotheby's had been ''asked to shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden.''
2001-02-02	Unsold At Auction	Last week's old master paintings sales in New York followed what has become a familiar pattern this season. While Sotheby's and Christie's were able to sell some works for exceedingly high prices, a large percentage of material in each auction remained unsold. Christie's sale included 175 works, of which 59 failed to sell. At Sotheby's, 219 paintings were offered and 84 never found buyers.
2001-01-31	Federal Judge Dismisses Three Suits On Auctions	A federal judge yesterday dismissed three lawsuits against Sotheby's and Christie's by buyers at foreign auctions who said they had been cheated in a price-fixing scheme dating back to 1992. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that because the auctions took place abroad without any direct or substantial impact in the United States they could not be tried under domestic antitrust laws.

2001-01-26	Two Museums Celebrate Mies	Museums, even those perceived as competitors, have begun sharing in new ways. They have started buying artworks together, teaming up on Internet ventures and jointly hiring experts. Now, for the first time in memory, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art will coordinate complementary exhibitions examining the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The Modern's show, ''Mies in Berlin,'' is the first in-depth look at this architect's early career. The Whitney's ''Mies in America'' will explore the last three decades of his achievements, from the time he left Germany for the United States in 1938 until his death in 1969. Both exhibitions open on June 21; the Modern's closes on Sept. 11, and the Whitney's on Sept. 23. Each museum will offer free admission to the other's members and joint tours for groups. The two museums plan to collaborate on a Mies symposium in September. And there's even talk of a collaborative Web site.
2001-01-26	Dealers Triumph With Americana	The Americana sales last week at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York were successful, but two Manhattan dealers proved they could still hold their own against the auction houses. First, the auction news. At Sotheby's the total for the Americana sales was $13.7 million. Pilgrim Century church silver consigned by the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Mass., sold last Friday for $3 million, far above its high estimate of $1.3 million. Pilgrim Century silver, from the 17th century, is extremely rare.
2001-01-20	Sotheby's Defends Proposed Settlement of Suit	Sotheby's argued in court papers made public yesterday that an important provision of a $512 million lawsuit settlement would not shortchange thousands of customers who have contended that they were defrauded by illegal collusion between the company and its archrival auction house, Christie's. Sotheby's defended the proposed issuance of $100 million in coupons to be distributed to customers for use against commission fees they would pay in future sales. The company contended that most customers would place full face value on the $100 million in coupons, which would be issued in lieu of cash under a plan awaiting approval by a federal judge.
2001-01-19	A Windfall For the Modern	The name Thomas Walther may not ring any bells with the public, but to people whose passion is photography, he is something of a legend. For more than 20 years, the German-born Mr. Walther has been quietly but obsessively collecting modernist photography, assembling hundreds of works by every leading European and American photographer of the 1920's and 30's. Not only is his collection well known among photography dealers and collectors, but museum curators have also been courting Mr. Walther in the hope that someday their institutions will get at least part of his prized holdings. Last summer the Metropolitan Museum of Art had a show called ''Other Pictures: Vernacular Photographs From the Thomas Walther Collection.'' This week the Museum of Modern Art announced that it had acquired photographs Mr. Walther made between the world wars, partly as a purchase and partly as a gift. The Modern was the first art museum to have a photography department and already had a comprehensive collection without Mr. Walther's contribution, but this addition substantially enriches it.
2001-01-19	Former Sotheby's Chief Forfeits Stock Options	Diana D. Brooks, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's, forfeited options last month to buy about two million shares of stock in the auction house. The market value of the options is about $11 million. At the time she resigned, Ms. Brooks volunteered to give back all but a few of her options. The company then asked for the return of all the options as partial payment for damages stemming from her role in a price-fixing scheme that has cost the auction house tens of millions of dollars in fines and lawsuit settlements. It also ensures that she will not profit from any increase in Sotheby's stock.
2001-01-13	Auction Houses Sweeten Deal	As they wait for a federal judge to give final approval to a $512 million class-action antitrust settlement, Sotheby's and Christie's have sweetened part of the deal they had agreed to in October. Under the original plan, the two auction houses charged with price fixing have the option of paying $100 million of the settlement in the form of discount certificates to future sellers toward commission fees and other charges.
2001-01-12	Sotheby's to Cut Staff 8%, With $14 Million Charge	Bracing for mounting fines, legal expenses and a possible downturn in the art market, Sotheby's, the troubled auction house, said yesterday that it planned to cut about 8 percent of its worldwide staff, to about 1,900 employees from 2,050. The downsizing will result in a fourth-quarter charge of about $14 million, mostly for severance-related expenses. ''We have spent months reviewing all of our auction operations around the world,'' said William Ruprecht, president and chief executive, ''and it's fair to say that our focus in the United States is principally on the high-end markets while in London we're making a commitment to the secondary sales room because we see an opportunity there in the middle market.''
2001-01-12	Biblical Portrait For Jerusalem	The Israel Museum in Jerusalem has just been given its first Rembrandt: ''St. Peter in Prison (The Apostle Peter Kneeling),'' a haunting 1631 image of Peter in his prison cell after he was captured by Herod's soldiers in Jerusalem. Judy and Michael Steinhardt, New York collectors and longtime supporters of the museum, gave the painting. ''St. Peter in Prison'' was just included in ''Rembrandt Creates Rembrandt: Art and Ambition in Leiden, 1629-1631,'' an exhibition that closed on Sunday at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The painting had been on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1998.
2001-01-05	Majority Owner of Sotheby's Is Weighing Sale of His Stake	A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's Holdings and the focus of a federal antitrust investigation, filed papers yesterday that signaled his exploration of a sale of his controlling interest in Sotheby's. Mr. Taubman reported in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had hired Credit Suisse First Boston to evaluate his investment in the auction house and put a value on his 13.2 million shares, a step that some financial analysts read as a prelude to divestiture or merger discussions. They also saw it as a tactical maneuver in the criminal investigation into his possible role in an illegal arrangement to fix commission fees that Sotheby's engaged in for much of the 90's with its archrival, Christie's. Mr. Taubman has denied any wrongdoing.
2000-12-24	Sotheby's to Sell Rocks And Books About Them	TODAY'S collectors increasingly view minerals as art objects rather than scientific specimens. They choose rocks for their intense colors, sculptural distinction and shimmering transparency, rejecting those with flaws, alterations or dramatic enhancements. And they study the pedigrees of, say, the glistening blood-red beauties of the mineral world called rhodocrocites as if they were buying Rauschenbergs or Rembrandts. Minerals, the oldest collectibles known to man, are a recent phenomenon in the marketplace. In the last decade, prices have skyrocketed, especially for the most glamorous pieces. And while children still dig for rocks in the soil, adults have left hobby shops behind to hunt elsewhere for bargains and rarities, on the Internet, at the galleries of dealers as well as at gem and mineral shows like those held in Munich and Tucson, Ariz.
2000-12-15	More Millions For Old Masters	Old master paintings from the collection of the Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild brought exceptionally high prices on Wednesday at Christie's in London. The works were part of Christie's old master paintings auction, which totaled $82.1 million, well above its high estimate of $65.1 million and the highest total ever for an old master painting sale there. The auction set 18 records. The clear star was Rembrandt's ''Portrait of a Lady, Aged 62'' (1632), bought for $28.6 million by Robert Noortman, a dealer based in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The price was more than three times the high estimate of $8.4 million and a record for the artist. Experts at the sale said Mr. Noortman was probably buying the painting to show in March at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht.
2000-12-14	U.S. Panel to Weigh Auction Certificates	A federal judge named two experts yesterday to study a provision allowing Sotheby's Holdings and Christie's to pay $100 million of a $512 million civil antitrust settlement in the form of discount certificates to future auction sellers. The rest would be paid in cash to about 100,000 auction customers who have sued the two auction houses on charges of price-fixing and other collusion.
2000-12-08	Twin Brothers With One Pursuit: Old Treasures	You don't have to know a thing about antiques to enjoy ''Hidden Treasures: Searching for Masterpieces of American Furniture,'' a new book by Leigh Keno, a New York dealer in American antiques, and his twin brother, Leslie Keno, the senior specialist in Americana at Sotheby's. The twins, who appear regularly as appraisers on ''Antiques Roadshow,'' the popular PBS television program, wrote the book with Joan Barzilay Freund, and it reads like a novel. It's one hunt after another, not all with happy endings. Both Kenos have made incredible discoveries, and they candidly share the stories in the work ($29.95), published by Warner Books.
2000-12-08	The Modern In Queens	The Museum of Modern Art has found a clever solution to a potential image problem.

2000-12-06	Twists and Turns in Sotheby's-Christie's Conspiracy Case	The clock is ticking for A. Alfred Taubman -- and for the government's efforts to tie him, as the former chairman of Sotheby's auction house, to a price-fixing conspiracy with its archrival, Christie's. With the federal judge assigned to the civil and criminal cases growing out of the conspiracy voicing mounting impatience with the pace of the Justice Department's four-year-old inquiry, the contours of a battle over Mr. Taubman's fate have begun to emerge in courtroom skirmishes and out-of-court maneuverings.
2000-11-29	Judge Blocks Questioning of Key Witnesses in Auction House Lawsuit	Expressing impatience with the pace of the criminal investigation of collusion between Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses, a federal judge in Manhattan yesterday nonetheless prohibited lawyers in a civil suit from questioning key figures in the government's four-year-old case. Questioning of subordinate figures can proceed, he ruled. Government lawyers argued that the questioning would disrupt their investigation.
2000-11-28	Art Sellers Look to Use Coupons in Settlement	Embroiled in a scandal over price-fixing and collusion, Sotheby's and Christie's asked a federal judge yesterday to approve a plan to offer discount certificates to auction customers as part of a $512 million settlement of a class-action civil suit. The certificates, which could be used by people who wanted to sell at future auctions, are part of a settlement that the auction houses agreed to last month. The agreement received preliminary approval this month by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan. As part of Sotheby's and Christie's obligation to buyers and sellers, the companies said, they would pay $50 million each in certificates.
2000-11-24	Dispersing A Private Cache	The name Franz Koenigs may not mean much outside the art world, but dealers, collectors and curators know Koenigs, a German-born financier, as one of the greatest art collectors of the 20th century. Koenigs (1881-1941) began buying art in Paris and London in his mid-20's, but from 1921 to 1933 he amassed one of the world's most impressive collections of Impressionist paintings, as well as old master, 19th- and 20th-century drawings. By the early 1930's he had put together more than 2,000 works of the highest quality, from Rubens and Van Dyck to Degas and Cezanne to albums of drawings by Fra Bartolommeo.
2000-11-22	Where the Sommeliers Shop	IN New York's overheated wine market, restaurant owners and their sommeliers are often forced to go to auctions to find the fine wines they want. Last Saturday, one of the city's best-known restaurateurs did just the opposite: he went to Sotheby's to sell wine, about $343,000 worth, as it turned out. The wine, some 241 lots of it, was from the cellar of Union Square Cafe, Danny Meyer's popular restaurant on East 16th Street. All but three of the lots were sold, according to Oliver Bareau of the wine department at Sotheby's, many of them to other restaurants.
2000-11-21	Legal Fees Set in Auction Settlement	Lawyers representing more than 100,000 customers who sued Sotheby's and Christie's for fixing auction prices would be paid $26.75 million in legal fees for reaching a $512 million settlement that had received preliminary approval from a federal judge. The firm of Boies, Schiller & Flexner of Armonk, N.Y., and Hanover, N.H., would receive the money upon final approval of the plan by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who scheduled a hearing for Feb. 2.

2000-11-15	10 Records in Contemporary Art Are Set at Sotheby's Auction	In the gossipy world of contemporary art, if the price is right and the buzz before a sale is positive, the merchandise will move. And move it did at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art last night, an evening that brought 10 records and solid bidding. On offer was consistently high-quality art from all periods -- everything from Abstract Expressionist and Pop art to some 1990's artists new to the auction rooms.
2000-11-15	Judge Leaves Open Amount Of Damages On Auctions	A federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that a proposed $512 million settlement of an antitrust lawsuit against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses could be submitted for consideration to more than 100,000 auction buyers and sellers who have asserted that the companies colluded to keep their fees high. Either side could urge the judge to accept or reject the settlement at a hearing on its final approval, which the judge set for Jan. 8 . The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, wrote in another order, however, that he was considering whether the auction houses and the former chairman of Sotheby's had the ability to pay even more than the $512 million, after their guilty pleas last month in a related federal criminal case.
2000-11-14	Lawyers Give Plan to Split Auction-Case Settlement	The lead lawyers representing the more than 100,000 buyers and sellers in a recently settled class-action lawsuit against the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses have detailed for the first time how they propose to divide the $512 million settlement. In court papers that were filed on Friday and made available yesterday, the lawyers, from the firm of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, proposed that the buyers and sellers, who say they were victims of a scheme to fix commissions on the part of the two houses, receive proportionate amounts of money based on their purchases and sales.
2000-11-01	A Third Bidder for Auction World Heft; Phillips, With a Rich New Parent, Seeks to Join Sotheby's and Christie's Cozy Club	As the Justice Department investigation into Sotheby's and Christie's unfolds, the world's largest auction houses are proceeding as if it is business as usual, gathering all the best Impressionist, modern and contemporary art they can for important auctions planned over the next two weeks. But the historical tug-of-war between Sotheby's and Christie's has turned into an expensive three-way fight. Both Sotheby's and Christie's have their share of exceptional works, but their catalogs of Impressionist and modern art seem bloated with second-rate paintings, drawings and sculptures that carry high estimates. The explanation is simple. Since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought Phillips, the London-based auction house a year ago, it has been going after property at any cost, dipping into LVMH's deep pockets to become a major player.
2000-11-01	Sotheby's and Christie's Face New Class-Action Suit	A class-action lawsuit filed yesterday on behalf of customers of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and Christie's International contends that several officials of both houses were aware of a conspiracy by their superiors to fix prices, but did nothing to stop it. The papers, which offer no proof to back up the accusations, contend that figures including Max M. Fisher, 92, the former vice chairman of Sotheby's, and Daniel P. Davison, a former chairman of the U.S. Trust Company who served as chairman of Christie's in America from 1989 to 1993, had knowledge of the collusion.
2000-10-31	Details of Settlement by 2 Big Auction Houses	A $512 million formal settlement of the class-action lawsuit against Sotheby's and Christie's lays out for the first time how the proceeds are to be divided among the more than 100,000 customers who said they were cheated by price-fixing and other collusion by the auction houses, according to Sotheby's court papers. The settlement, awaited since Sept. 22 and filed Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, provides for the money -- minus unspecified lawyers' fees and administrative expenses -- to be distributed ''pro rata based upon each class member's alleged overcharges'' on domestic transactions. The calculations would take into account sellers' commissions paid on auction sales from Sept. 1, 1997, through Feb. 7, 2000, and purchase fees paid by buyers from Jan. 1, 1993, through Feb. 7, 2000.
2000-10-28	AUCTION HOUSES SIGN PACT TO REPAY $512 MILLION	Sotheby's and Christie's completed an agreement yesterday to pay $512 million to settle claims that they cheated about 100,000 buyers and sellers in a price-fixing scheme dating back to 1992. The civil settlement, to which they agreed on Sept. 22, comes as prosecutors for the Justice Department stepped up efforts to conclude a three-year criminal investigation focusing on evidence that the world's largest auction houses stifled competition by colluding on a wide range of business practices. Last month, Sotheby's pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws, as did Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's former president and chief executive. Officials at Christie's turned over documents to the Justice Department in January and in return received conditional amnesty. Carol Vogel (NYT)
2000-10-24	SETTLEMENT REPORTED ALMOST READY IN AUCTION CASE	After more than four weeks of arguing over details, lawyers for Sotheby's and Christie's and customers suing the auction giants for price-fixing are close to signing a $512 million civil settlement, a lawyer told an impatient federal judge yesterday. With no sign of the final papers since the parties reported reaching agreement Sept. 22, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan called both sides into his Manhattan courtroom yesterday to say that without a formal settlement they faced a February trial date. Richard Drubel of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, lead counsel for the class of more than 100,000 customers who say they were cheated by collusive practices, told the judge he expected a final agreement ''within 48 hours.''

Gregg Allman signed a Harley Davidson leather jacket and Sting, ZZ Top and Alice Cooper autographed a Planet Hollywood denim jacket.
2000-10-20	Selling a Rug With a Past	Sotheby's has omitted a few details from its catalog for today's sale of the contents of Mercer House, the 19th-century Italianate mansion in the heart of Savannah, Ga., that is perhaps best known as the home of Jim Williams. He was the antiques dealer who was the protagonist in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' the best-selling book, and in the movie based on it. Take Lot 399, an Oushak carpet from the first half of the 20th century, expected to sell for $10,000 to $15,000. The carpet is the one on which Danny Hansford, the 21-year-old lover of Williams, fell when he was shot to death in 1981. A bullet hole in the carpet was crucial evidence in the well-documented murder trials as prosecutors measured the angle of the bullet's path through the carpet and into the floor to prove that Williams fired the last shots, execution style, standing over Hansford as he lay dying on the carpet.
2000-10-19	Access Ordered In Auction Case	A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's and a target of the government's investigation into auction-house collusion, won a judge's approval yesterday for access to information described as crucial to his case. ''There's too much foot-dragging in this case,'' said the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who rejected two motions to delay the turnover of records produced in a class-action lawsuit brought by customers of Sotheby's and its archrival, Christie's.
2000-10-18	Accord by Auction Houses Is Still Unsigned	Nearly a month after agreeing to pay $512 million to settle claims that they cheated buyers and sellers by fixing commission fees, Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses still have not signed the final settlement papers, and the judge in the case has ordered them to appear in court Monday to explain why. Antitrust lawyers say it is rare for this length of time to go by without a signing, raising speculation that difficulties have emerged that have delayed the agreement.
2000-10-13	A Mother Lode Of Americana	There's an opportunity to do serious one-stop shopping today at Sotheby's. In fact, Americana fans could fill an entire house with these pedigreed treasures of American furniture. Sotheby's ''Important Americana'' sale today includes several lots from the collection of the late Dr. William S. Serri, a renowned collector from Woodbury, N.J. Of special note are a Queen Anne mahogany pie-crust tea table from Philadelphia, circa 1750; a Chippendale mahogany bonnet-top chest-on-chest made in the Boston area, circa 1775; a Chippendale mahogany drop-leaf table with carved claw-and-ball feet from New York, circa 1765; and a Chippendale mahogany dressing table from Philadelphia, circa 1765.
2000-10-11	Sotheby's And Amazon To Share Site	Eighteen months after Sotheby's announced that it was joining forces with Amazon.com to run two separate online ventures, Sothebys.com and Sothebys.amazon.com, the beleaguered auction house said it would combine the two sites into one -- Sothebys.com. The online business was the brainchild of Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's former chief executive, who on Thursday pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate antitrust laws in collusion with Sotheby's archrival, Christie's. Ms. Brooks resigned from the auction house in February.
2000-10-08	A Backdoor Route To Wine Auctions	A small, rundown shop at 95 Trinity Place in Lower Manhattan is undergoing extensive renovations. It is probable that its former name, G's Wines and Spirits, meant little at the American Stock Exchange, across the street. The new name, Aulden Cellars, may ring a bell there. Aulden, which is open Monday through Saturday, is the retail partner that enabled Sotheby's to resume New York auctions of fine and rare wines after that house's five-year relationship with Sherry-Lehmann, the upscale Madison Avenue merchant, collapsed last November in a contract dispute.
2000-10-08	SECRET PARTNERS: The Unraveling of a Conspiracy; Private Files Fuel an Art Auction Inquiry	Last December, Christie's, the London-based auction house, was forcing out its chief executive, Christopher M. Davidge, who had fallen from favor with the company's new owner. Christie's executives and lawyers played tough and negotiations turned bitter as Christmas approached. Mr. Davidge, a third-generation Christie's employee attuned to slights in an upper-class society where he never felt comfortable, was angered over what he regarded as a paltry severance package, two friends said.
2000-10-06	In Plea, Sotheby's Ex-Chief Points to Her Superior	Speaking in a low, controlled voice, Diana D. Brooks, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's auction house, pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom in Manhattan yesterday to fixing commission fees with the company's archrival, Christie's, and pointed the finger at A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman, whose orders she said she was following. Within an hour, Mr. Taubman, the Detroit shopping center magnate who bought a controlling interest in Sotheby's in 1983, fired back with a sharp denial issued through a spokesman. ''Whatever Ms. Brooks chose to do, she did completely on her own without my knowledge or approval,'' Mr. Taubman, 75, said. ''If the need arises, I will vigorously defend myself against any charges.'' He and Ms. Brooks resigned under pressure in February as the case against them built.

2000-10-05	Former Sotheby's Chief Is Said To Be Planning to Plead Guilty	After a three-year investigation into the multibillion-dollar auction business, Diana D. Brooks, the former president and chief executive of Sotheby's, has agreed to plead guilty today to conspiring to violate antitrust laws in collusion with Sotheby's archrival, Christie's, people close to Ms. Brooks and the government said yesterday. The felony plea would leave Ms. Brooks, 50, once seen as the most powerful woman in the art world, facing a possible three-year federal prison sentence and a large fine.
2000-10-04	Christie's Ordered to Answer in Antitrust Suit	The federal judge hearing a civil antitrust lawsuit against Sotheby's and Christie's yesterday questioned Christie's good faith in refusing to answer questions posed by one of the defendants and ordered the auction house to respond or face possible sanctions. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, ruled that Christie's had to respond ''fully and completely'' by Oct. 14 to the questions posed by lawyers for A. Alfred Taubman, a former chairman of Sotheby's.
2000-09-30	Brand-Name Auctions, Cut-Rate Connoisseurs	To many both inside and outside the art world, seeing the names Sotheby's and Christie's next to the words ''collusion'' and ''price-fixing'' has come as something of a shock. The auction houses have long maintained an air of white-glove purity, of aristocratic connoisseurship. The fact that the houses are now facing considerable public embarrassment, not to mention a $512 million settlement to the customers they allegedly defrauded, has sent nervous tremors throughout the art market -- many collectors especially are wondering how this will undermine the sanctity of art transactions. But the tarnishing of Sotheby's and Christie's ancient escutcheons may turn out to be a good thing for the art world, and even for art.
2000-09-27	Christie's Approves Settlement	Christie's announced yesterday that it had approved a $256 million settlement of civil claims that it, along with its archrival, Sotheby's, cheated buyers and sellers as far back as 1992. Forty-eight hours earlier, Sotheby's disclosed that its board approved its half of the $512 million settlement. Sotheby's former chairman and majority shareholder A. Alfred Taubman is paying $156 million of the auction house's $256 million payment, but Christie's said in a written statement yesterday that it together with its parent company, Christie's International, was coming up with all the money itself.
2000-09-25	Ex-Chief to Pay Bulk of Claims For Sotheby's	Moving quickly to settle civil claims that it had cheated auction buyers and sellers for years, the board of Sotheby's last night approved payment of its half of a $512 million settlement, the auction house announced last night. The bulk of the Sotheby's payment will come from its majority shareholder and former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman. Mr. Taubman agreed to pay $156 million of the auction house's $256 million portion during an emergency telephone meeting of Sotheby's directors from around the world late yesterday. In exchange, the company settled all potential claims against him.
2000-09-23	Art Auction Houses Agree to Pay $512 Million in Price-Fixing Case	The world's largest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, agreed yesterday to pay $512 million to settle claims that they cheated buyers and sellers in a price-fixing scheme dating back to 1992. The civil settlement, reported by lawyers but not officially announced, comes as prosecutors for the Justice Department are stepping up efforts to conclude a three-year criminal investigation focusing on evidence that the two auction giants stifled competition by colluding on a host of business practices.
2000-09-22	A Rare Stroll In the Garden	When Sotheby's and Christie's are finishing their plans for the annual November evening sales of Impressionist and Modern art, it always adds an air of mystery to have an important painting the public has not seen for decades. That's the case this year for Sotheby's, which will be offering Manet's ''Woman in a Garden,'' a luscious Impressionist landscape that was last shown 47 years ago, in an exhibition in Minnesota. The painting carries an estimate of $20 million to $30 million and will be offered in New York on Nov. 9. It is an unusually large canvas -- 60 1/2 by 46 inches -- and depicts an American woman, a friend of the artist known only as Mademoiselle Marguerite, reading in the garden behind a Paris house Manet rented in the summer of 1880.
2000-09-10	Sotheby's Trying to Tame Its Noisy Air-Conditioner	Sotheby's has one more chance to fix its noisy air-conditioning system, or the city will block the unit's power, officials said last week after issuing a fourth violation against the auction house. But executives at Sotheby's, at First Avenue and East 76th Street, said they had been working to fix the problem since it was brought to their attention last year. The noise, measured on Thursday, was about six decibels above the legal limit, which varies with the level of ambient noise in an area.
2000-08-01	Testimony Is Delayed in Auction Suit	Justice Department antitrust prosecutors investigating Christie's and Sotheby's won a court order yesterday postponing the taking of testimony in a civil suit against the giant auction houses until at least Sept. 11. The government had argued that the questioning of witnesses in the civil case could prejudice its criminal investigation.
2000-07-27	Talks Intensify With Ex-Chief Of Sotheby's	Discussions to win the cooperation of Sotheby's former president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, in the federal antitrust investigation of Sotheby's and Christie's have intensified, lawyers and others close to the case said this week. The talks, they said, are aimed at getting Ms. Brooks to testify that she colluded in anticompetitive deals with her counterpart at Christie's at the direction of the former chairman at Sotheby's, A. Alfred Taubman. Mr. Taubman, a shopping center magnate who purchased the controlling interest in Sotheby's in 1983, resigned in February, along with Ms. Brooks. He has denied any wrongdoing.
2000-07-22	Civil Auction Suits Face Possible Curb	Prosecutors investigating allegations of collusion and price fixing by the world's largest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, have gone to Federal District Court in Manhattan to prevent lawyers for hundreds of angry buyers and sellers from formally interviewing people who may figure in the investigation. In a letter to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan dated July 17, federal prosecutors asked permission to file a motion to forbid lawyers in the civil case against the two auction houses to take depositions from Christopher M. Davidge, Christie's former chief executive, who resigned last Dec. 24. Further, they will move to stop the lawyers from deposing anyone else who may be connected to their investigation until a criminal grand jury finishes its work.
2000-07-14	The Getty Acquires A New Old Master	The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles had its eye on several paintings at the old master auctions in London last week. It ended up buying an El Greco. Four bidders at Sotheby's on July 6 fought over ''Christ on the Cross,'' a haunting image of Jesus set against a dark background of swirling clouds. The Getty ended up buying it for $5.8 million, a record for the artist.
2000-07-06	Getting Close-Up Look At Declaration of Independence	With a new imaging technology called ImagePump, developed by Xippix of Larkspur, Calif., American history buffs can get an up-close look at one of the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence, only 25 of which are known to survive, according to Sotheby's online auction site (www.sothebys.com), where the copy was sold last week for $8.14 million. The ImagePump magnifier at Sotheby's.com allows the viewer to click and drag a mouse across different areas of the page, and zoom in to see the full size print. The actual document measures 19 3/4 inches by 15 3/4 inches, but the viewable area on most computer screens is limited to a 3-inch by 3-inch box, which means only a few segments can be viewed at a time.
2000-07-04	He's Auctioned the 1776 Declaration, Twice	The man who sold the Declaration of Independence: now there's one the Colonials could not pin on Benedict Arnold, a frustrated careerist angry at being passed over for a promotion. David N. Redden, auction-house careerist, sounds neither frustrated nor angry: he got the promotion, to vice chairman of Sotheby's, in February. Last week, he sold the declaration, for $7.4 million. It was the second time that Mr. Redden had sold that particular copy of the declaration, one of 25 surviving from a batch printed on July 4, 1776. The first time, in 1991, it went for $2.2 million. Before that, before the well-tailored auctioneer was involved, it was a $4 flea-market item hidden in a the frame behind a bargain hunter's second-rate painting.
2000-07-03	London Buyers Ignore Auction Inquiry	As collectors and dealers gathered here last week for Christie's and Sotheby's big sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, the auction houses' legal troubles in the United States seemed to make no difference to the buyers. Still, it was clear that the shadow cast by the federal antitrust investigation in New York had crossed the Atlantic. At the same moment on Tuesday night that Sotheby's was holding its important sale of Impressionist and modern art at its Bond Street headquarters here, Christie's was conducting its auction of contemporary art just a few blocks away on King Street. Such scheduling conflicts never happened in the past when the two companies met openly to plan the year's auctions. But with prosecutors investigating whether the auction houses fixed prices and questioning every move they make, it was obvious that a message was being not so subtly delivered, even at this distance.
2000-06-30	For 1776 Copy of Declaration, A Record in an Online Auction	What price liberty? A copy of the Declaration of Independence that was printed in 1776 and discovered behind a $4 flea-market painting in 1989 was sold yesterday for $7.4 million, 23 percent more than Sotheby's highest preauction estimate and a record for a copy of the document. It was also one of the highest prices paid for a document sold over the Internet. No comprehensive tallies of prices from Internet auctions exist, although eBay, the online auction house that sells everything from tiny figurines to souped-up cars to century-old copies of National Geographic magazine, said several months ago that it believed that a Picasso had sold for just under $2 million in an online deal last year.
2000-06-20	Sotheby's Biggest Shareholder Still Criticizes Board Makeup	The Baron Capital Group, a New York mutual fund that is the largest outside shareholder of Sotheby's, filed a notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday saying that it continues to believe that electing the son of the former chairman and some of his friends to the board would present a conflict of interest. A. Alfred Taubman, the real estate developer who is Sotheby's largest shareholder, resigned in February amid allegations of price-fixing at the company. Mr. Taubman, who retains voting control of the company and its board through stock ownership, wanted his son Robert to take his place on the board.
2000-06-11	From Polynesia, Artwork Fit For Warriors	CURATORS, collectors and dealers of tribal art converged last month on Sotheby's in New York to view, gossip about and bid small fortunes for two 19th-century Polynesian rarities: a brilliantly colored Hawaiian feather cape and a curious Austral Islands necklace of whalebone, ivory and human hair. Their obscure histories (they were unknown to scholars until the sale was announced in January) and their freshly restored condition made them hot topics of discussion in tribal art, a field considered one of the most rumor-ridden in today's art market. Such concerns notwithstanding, the objects brought record prices for Polynesian art. Long the battle garb of kings and warriors, feather capes and cloaks are the most glorious of all Hawaiian objects. Even after contact with Europeans 300 years ago, each garment, patterned as graphically as paintings by Calder or Miro, was unique, a status symbol at court or the most sumptuous royal gift to foreign visitors. The necklace was also worn by champion warriors in the Austral Islands, part of the Cook group, who, it was said, were allowed to possess any woman while wearing it.
2000-06-09	Sotheby's Plans Web Auction	Sotheby's has decided not to hold its annual February auction of contemporary art in its York Avenue headquarters next year but instead to put it on Sothebys.com, its Internet site. This move allows the house to capitalize on its recent success in selling lower-priced contemporary art online. It is also a way of bolstering Sotheby's online business, as the company has had trouble obtaining enough art and objects to fill its dot-com sales, people close to the Internet business have said.
2000-05-31	Plan to Fill Sotheby's Board Seat Is Faulted	The largest outside shareholder in Sotheby's Holdings says that electing the son of the former chairman to a board seat would represent a conflict of interest in the face of the continuing criminal investigation into price-fixing at the auction house. Sotheby's and its rival, Christie's, are the subjects of a Justice Department investigation into accusations that the two auction houses fixed commissions charged to buyers and sellers for several years. Christie's disclosed Jan. 28 that it had agreed to cooperate in exchange for leniency, and people involved in the case said prosecutors were in the late stages of evaluating possible criminal charges involving Sotheby's.
2000-05-27	Selling the Farm, Park Avenue Style; For a Pair of Socialites, It's Out With the Ormolu	If Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette held a garage sale before the deluge, it probably looked a lot like the scene at Sotheby's yesterday, where Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg offered to unload hundreds of their possessions, from a multimillion-dollar commode to the living room curtains. That was not all Mr. Steinberg sold yesterday. Reliance Group Holdings, the insurance company he has owned for three decades that has been teetering on the brink of insolvency, announced that an investment concern would buy Reliance for the fire-sale price of $2.55 a share. [Page C1.]
2000-05-21	Parties Oil the Wheels of Art Sales	ON half a dozen nights in the last two weeks, tuxedoed men have whispered discreetly into telephones, and gavels have rapped down in brightly lighted rooms where the earnest business of the big spring art auctions was taking place. The scene was wildly different, however, on Monday evening at Christie's. Foam spewed from bubble machines suspended above the building's canopy at Rockefeller Plaza, as 900 guests arrived for a party called the Bubble Bash. ''I hope it's not a reference to any bubbles bursting on Wall Street,'' said Jill Spalding, an immaculately groomed guest, sidestepping a volley of descending bubbles.
2000-05-19	Culling Trophies Of a Boom	Enough years have passed since the roaring 1980's that it's probably time for a television mini-series on the decade. And what would furnish the sets better than the antiques in the collection of the swashbuckling tycoon Saul Steinberg and his wife, Gayfryd, who are selling most of their decorative arts collection at Sotheby's next Friday? Until very recently the collection was in the Steinbergs' 37-room Park Avenue triplex, possibly the largest apartment in New York, which they recently sold for about $35 million to Stephen Schwarzman, president of Blackstone Group, the investment firm.
2000-05-19	Sculptor Chosen For Biennale	The much-admired sculptor Robert Gober will represent the United States at the 2001 Venice Biennale. Known for his surreal and perfect re-creations of body parts and everyday objects like sinks, urinals and drainpipes, he relates his work to the explicit and social-political art of the late 80's and early 90's in oblique and illusive ways. Mr. Gober, 46, lives in New York City. He was selected by the Fund for U.S. Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions, a public-private partnership of the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, after curators and contemporary-art museums nationwide were asked to propose candidates.
2000-05-18	A Taste of the 80's: High Prices Are Back in an Auction of Contemporary Art	In the elevator at Sotheby's after last night's sale of contemporary art, two collectors were bemoaning all the things they didn't buy last year. While prices just six months ago may have seemed too expensive, compared to last night's prices they were a veritable bargain. Bidding on contemporary art of all periods, tastes and styles was fast and furious, often exceeding the heady prices of the 1980's art boom. The sale totaled $46 million, above its high estimate of $41 million. Of the 70 works offered, only 3 failed to sell.
2000-05-13	Two Auction Houses Disclose Confidential Records	Exploring a possible settlement of a potentially vast class action lawsuit, Sotheby's and Christie's have turned over confidential company information to lawyers representing customers who have accused them of price-fixing in the wake of a federal antitrust investigation. The information was disclosed yesterday during a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan at which the chief federal antitrust prosecutor in New York sought to keep confidential, at least through Aug. 12, documents described as central to the grand jury investigation.
2000-05-11	Natty New Image for the 'Other' Auction House	''IT'S just as splendid as Sotheby's or Christie's,'' said Dan Klein, the international executive director of Phillips auction house, exuding an air of proprietary triumph last week as he toured the American Craft Museum at 40 West 53rd Street. Only 10 days earlier, the galleries were earthy shades of orange, yellow and green. But the designer Bill Katz has transformed the museum into a gleaming white showcase for artworks from Phillips's spring sales, creating walls for intimate viewing and banishing the cluttered gift shop. Passing multimillion-dollar canvases, Mr. Klein stopped to pose before an Andy Warhol silkscreen that seemed prophetic: a giant dollar sign.
2000-05-11	Despite Legal Troubles, Sotheby's Makes a Strong Showing at Art Auction	For a company beleaguered by a federal antitrust investigation, Sotheby's pulled off a impressive sale of Impressionist and modern art last night. Its York Avenue salesroom was overflowing with collectors, dealers and curiosity seekers. The regulars came to watch as millions of dollars' worth of art by masters like Monet and Matisse, Picasso and van Gogh changed hands. But some in the audience were drawn by the publicity Sotheby's has received since the resignations of A. Alfred Taubman, its chairman and major stockholder, and Diana D. Brooks, its president and chief executive, in February. Sotheby's faces the possibility of steep fines and dozens of lawsuits alleging that the company colluded with its archrival Christie's to fix the prices it charges buyers and sellers.
2000-05-09	To Bidders, the Art Matters More Than the Legalities	It may be the source of deep concern in the art world, but the federal antitrust investigation of the world's two largest auction houses elicited a well-heeled shrug from many prospective bidders last night at Christie's auction of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art. The Justice Department investigation, which came to wide attention when two top officials at Sotheby's resigned in February, centers on whether the leadership of Sotheby's and its archrival, Christie's, colluded to set commissions they charge buyers and sellers. While those allegations had certainly registered in the minds of those present last night, most drew a firm distinction between the behind-the-scenes scandal and the art on display.
2000-05-08	An Absence at Auction Time; Former Sotheby's Official Is in Limbo Instead of in the Spotlight	In other times, this would have been Diana D. Brooks's moment. On the eve of the multimillion-dollar spring auctions of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's in New York, it was always Ms. Brooks's striking presence and booming voice that predominated.
2000-05-03	State Bidder Buys Relics For China	The confrontation between the Chinese authorities and Hong Kong's premier auction houses over the sale of looted imperial treasures has been defused, for now at least, by an unlikely source: a giant Chinese state-owned corporation that became the winning bidder on three of the four contested objects. The company, the China Poly Group Corp., which until last year was owned by the People's Liberation Army and is best known for its global weapons sales, recently established a small antiquities museum here with an emphasis on ancient bronzes. Part of its mission is to buy choice Chinese relics abroad and bring them back to the motherland, and as was clear in recent days, it has very deep pockets.
2000-05-01	Christie's Auctions Relics Despite China's Objection	Brushing aside the angry objections of China, Christie's auctioned two relics today that the Chinese government said had been looted from an imperial palace 140 years ago. The pieces, bronze sculptures of an ox head and a monkey head, each sold for slightly more than $1 million, far above the estimate of $500,000 to $580,000 in the Christie's catalog.
2000-04-29	China Asks Auction Houses to Withdraw 4 Relics	The Chinese government has thrown the art market in this capitalist outpost into an uproar by asking Sotheby's and Christie's to withdraw four relics -- which Beijing says were stolen 140 years ago -- at next week's auctions of Chinese antiquities here. An official at the State Cultural Relics Bureau said that the objects, a vase and three sculptures, were taken from a Qing dynasty palace when it was ransacked by British and French troops. The official, Wang Limei, said that the bureau was asking Sotheby's and Christie's not to sell them in Hong Kong because ''it is insulting and deeply painful to the Chinese people to have these things sold before their eyes.''
2000-04-27	Knight Errant Or Erring? Sotheby's Tale	Sometimes fairy tales do not have happy endings, even for knights in shining armor. That lesson should come as no surprise to A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping mall magnate who has made a second career out of rescuing companies in distress from the arms of unwelcome suitors. Nobody, however, could have dreamed up a tale like that of Sotheby's, the venerable auction house that Mr. Taubman saved in 1983. As if by magic, it recovered and prospered under Mr. Taubman's reign as chairman. It hit a rough patch in the early 1990's, along with the rest of his empire. Then, Sotheby's rebounded once more -- until federal investigators intervened.
2000-04-24	Genteel Auction Houses Turning Aggressive	Every weekday a list of rich New Yorkers who have died recently is faxed to desks at the city's dominant auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's. Compiled by an outside service, it contains names of the deceased, the value of their estates and names and addresses of relatives and executors. Well-staffed departments at the houses then contact families and executors in an unending quest for old master paintings, family heirlooms and other goods to feed the growing appetite for auctions.
2000-04-22	Lawyer Auction in an Auction Suit	For two months the federal judge presiding over mountains of litigation against the auction giants Sotheby's and Christie's knew that he faced a thorny problem: how to select the lawyers from at least 25 firms across the country to lead the growing class-action suit charging the two houses with price-fixing. Yesterday he came up with an answer. Hold an auction.
2000-04-20	Investor Raises Questions on Sotheby's Board	Ronald Baron, the New York money manager whose funds are the largest shareholders in Sotheby's Holdings Inc., has questioned the auction house board's independence in a filing with the government. The Baron funds have invested about $500 million in Sotheby's, which is a target of a federal antitrust investigation, and the filing may signal an effort by Mr. Baron to elect new directors to the board, now dominated by people aligned with Sotheby's former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman.
2000-04-18	Sotheby's Resumes Auctions of Fine Wines	Sotheby's resumed wine auctions on Saturday, five months after it broke with its longtime partner, the East Side wine merchant Sherry-Lehman. The renewed auctions could help New York City re-establish its status, acquired in the late 1990's, as a rival to London's historically unchallenged domination of the world's secondary market for rare and fine wines.
2000-04-13	Sotheby's Denies Conspiring With Rival to Fix Commissions	Sotheby's denied conspiring with its rival auction house Christie's to fix commissions for buyers and sellers yesterday and asked a federal judge to dismiss civil suits filed against them. In a response to the suits filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for Sotheby's denied each of the accusations contained in the civil complaint against the two auction houses.
2000-04-07	Ex-Leaders of 2 Auction Giants Are Said to Initiate Price-Fixing	Prosecutors in the federal antitrust investigation of Sotheby's and Christie's have evidence that a scheme to limit competition by fixing commissions charged to buyers and sellers was set in motion not by subordinates, but by the chairmen of the world's auction giants at the time, according to people involved in the investigation. The two leaders, A. Alfred Taubman of Sotheby's and Sir Anthony Tennant of Christie's, discussed the arrangement in person and then instructed their chief executives to meet to carry out the scheme, according to the accounts from the people involved in the inquiry.
2000-03-31	Scandinavian Dealer Sells His Treasures	Sotheby's sale of the Arne Schlesch collection next week marks the passing of an era. Mr. Schlesch, 77, has sold his five-story Scandinavian antiques gallery on East 64th Street, consigned its contents to Sotheby's and retired to Copenhagen. ''There's a limit to how long you can go on buying chandeliers and chairs,'' he said. ''I made my hobby into a lucrative business. I was thrilled to buy things, especially from families I knew. It was fun.'' He was fun too. A native of Denmark, Mr. Schlesch said he was descended ''on both sides'' from Charlemagne (742-814). ''I am not a snob,'' he insisted. ''I simply belong to an old family.''
2000-03-30	No Bonus or Options in 1999 For Sotheby's Former Chief	The chief executive of Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks, who resigned last month amid accusations that the company conspired with its rival Christie's to fix prices, received no bonus and no stock options last year, according to the company's latest annual proxy statement scheduled to be mailed out today. Other top executives at the auction house, including William F. Ruprecht, who succeeded Ms. Brooks, were awarded bonuses and options.
2000-03-27	Big Spring Seen for Art Sales	As news of the federal antitrust investigation of Sotheby's and Christie's broke at the end of January, these auction houses were right in the middle of trying to convince sellers that it was the time to put their prized works of art in the houses' big May New York sales. ''We did get calls from people asking how the investigation would affect the market,'' said David Norman, head of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York. ''And I'm sure some people held back. But not many.''
2000-03-24	INSIDE ART	Spring Tulips From Picasso With the important spring and summer auctions approaching, Sotheby's and Christie's have begun crowing about the big-ticket works they have to offer. And with all the negative publicity from the continuing federal antitrust investigation into their practices, both companies are more determined than ever to put out the word that business is going on as usual. Christie's says it will have the season's most important work: ''Still Life With Tulips,'' a 1932 portrait by Picasso of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter. The painting, estimated at $25 million to $30 million, is to be auctioned in New York on May 9.
2000-03-23	Art Business Has Soared At Smaller Auction House	As the federal antitrust investigation of Sotheby's and Christie's continues, officials of Phillips, the distant third among worldwide auction houses, yesterday said that their New York business had exploded, with the house's coming spring sale setting what is far and away a record for the 206-year-old firm. The officials said that their May auction of Impressionist and modern art was valued at more than $80 million, compared with a similar $3.6 million sale in 1998, which, however humble in comparison, was considered a pretty good total at the time. Topping the list of works to be offered is a painting by the Russian abstract painter Kasimir Malevich, which had also been sought by Christie's. The painting, ''Suprematist Composition,'' which art experts say is worth more than $10 million, is easily the most expensive work of art ever handled by Phillips, topping a Monet seascape which sold in 1998 for $2.5 million.
2000-03-20	The Auction Hullabaloo Reverberates At Art Fair	When the doors to the European Fine Art Fair opened here on Friday afternoon, the 198 exhibitors were all smiles, eager to talk about the prized offerings they were placing before some 8,200 visitors who poured into the convention center where the fair is held every March. But beneath the polite banter, the atmosphere at this, the world's largest art fair, was politically charged. Talk of the unfolding federal antitrust investigation of auction houses in New York was everywhere, and with it speculation about the increase that the biggest of the houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, plan to charge buyers.
2000-03-19	Kenneth Tyler to Close Studio	PICTURE an elegant white chambered nautilus of a building settled on a Mount Kisco slope. ''The perfect studio,'' the printmaker Kenneth Tyler once called it. Yet Mr. Tyler recently announced he will close the studio's doors here later this year. His reasoning?
2000-03-17	INSIDE ART	Once Radical, Now Recherche A group of contemporary artworks from what Sotheby's describes only as a private European collection are to be auctioned on May 17 in New York at Sotheby's as part of a wider evening sale of contemporary art. The works, dating from 1965 to 1971, range from Minimalist sculpture and painting to Conceptual photography and neon installations. The entire collection is expected to sell for about $3 million. Among the most prized works is Bruce Nauman's ''Light Trap for Henry Moore, No. 1'' (1967), a black-and-white photograph made by twirling a flashlight in a darkened room and recording the glowing spirals. It is expected to sell for $250,000 to $350,000. The artist's catalogue raisonne says it is from the collection of Angelo Baldassarre, who is thought to be the seller of the collection.
2000-03-17	Auction Firms Said to Share Client Lists	Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's two most powerful auction houses, swapped confidential lists of superrich clients who were spared from paying fees charged to other sellers, people close to the companies and to a federal antitrust investigation of them said. The shared and overlapping lists of about 50 names which include some of the world's wealthiest families were described as a crucial tool for auction houses to use in enforcing a form of price control in which certain customers were charged lower commissions, down to zero, that both houses honored. At the same time, both houses charged identical rates, up to 20 percent, to other sellers who had little chance of negotiation.
2000-03-16	Customers Add New Charges In Auction Case	The top executives of Sotheby's and Christie's, the two archrival auction giants under federal antitrust investigation for collusion, held secret discussions and meetings to fix prices, and one maintained ''a highly unusual, concealed separate filing system'' to hide the conspiracy from shareholders and government regulators, a new complaint contended yesterday. The complaint, filed in a civil action on behalf of disgruntled customers who say they were bilked by illegal anti-competitive practices by Sotheby's and Christie's going back to at least 1993, offered new details of how the houses were said to have conspired to share the multibillion-dollar market in art and antiques.
2000-03-11	Sotheby's to Resume Wine Auctions Next Month With New Partner	Sotheby's, which held wine auctions in Manhattan for five years with Sherry-Lehmann until they split in November, has found a new partner and intends to resume auctions on April 15. A second auction is scheduled for May 20. Michael Davis, head of Sotheby's North American wine department, based in Chicago, identified the new partner as Aulden Cellars. Mr. Davis said Aulden was a division of Connoisseur Encounters, ''a multimillion-dollar firm now operating in four states.'' Mr. Davis said Encounters ''maintains a selection of over 1,000 labels, concentrating on rare, limited release and boutique wines.''
2000-03-03	Sotheby's Reports Earnings Under Cloud of Investigation	Sotheby's Holdings could do little to dispel investors' concerns over the outcome of a federal antitrust investigation yesterday as it discussed its Internet prospects and fourth-quarter results. While Sotheby's earnings were slightly better than Wall Street had expected, the company said it would eliminate its first-quarter dividend because of ''significant cash needs'' from its online forays and uncertainty surrounding the investigation.
2000-03-01	Sotheby's Joins Christie's In Revising Its Commissions	Three weeks after Christie's, the auction house giant, changed its commissions because of a federal antitrust investigation, Sotheby's revised its rates as well yesterday, making them nearly identical to those of its rival. The two houses are under investigation for possibly colluding to set commissions for buyers and sellers on the billions of dollars of fine art they auction every year.
2000-02-26	Questions on the Auction Block	No indictments have been handed down yet, and the scope of the inquiry is still unclear. But both Christie's and Sotheby's, New York's leading art-auction houses, are preparing for their spring sales under the cloud of an antitrust investigation for possible collusion in setting the commissions they charge. Spokesmen for both houses say they are going about business as usual despite the investigation, putting together spring sales catalogues that they hope will not reflect too sharply, in either number or quality of works to be auctioned, the pall this investigation casts. But it was not business as usual in 1997 when trucks hauled away subpoenaed documents from both firms. Nor was it a matter of routine last month when the chief executive of Christie's, which is privately owned, resigned just a week before that firm agreed to cooperate with federal investigators in return for immunity. This past week, Diane Brooks, president and chief executive of Sotheby's, and Alfred Taubman, its chairman and principal stockholder, also stepped down. To replace Mr. Taubman, Sotheby's board of directors has hired Michael Sovern, the former president of Columbia University.
2000-02-24	Will Inquiry's Shadow Chill Art Auctions?	As the world's two dominant auction houses find themselves embroiled in a widening federal antitrust investigation, experts at both are racing to get major property for their important spring auctions. Time is running out. With the deadlines less than a month away for printing catalogs for sales that could exceed $500 million, collectors must decided whether to sell a $5 million Picasso now or wait for the potentially market-weakening commotion to die down.
2000-02-23	Sotheby's Head Says Setbacks Will Be Costly But Not Fatal	As its stock took another beating yesterday, the new chairman of Sotheby's, the beleaguered international auction house, predicted that an extensive federal antitrust investigation and various class-action lawsuits would be ''expensive but not life-threatening'' for the 256-year-old company. ''The message has to be that the company is in sound shape and that the management team is intact except for the two top people,'' Michael I. Sovern, the former president of Columbia University, said in a phone interview. Mr. Sovern, who has frequently stepped into trouble-shooting situations, was named to replace Sotheby's largest shareholder, A. Alfred Taubman, as chairman at a board meeting Monday. Resigning with Mr. Taubman was the company's president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, who was replaced by William F. Ruprecht, formerly in charge of the company's North and South American operations.
2000-02-22	Top Executives Quit Sotheby's As Art World Inquiry Widens	As it deals with a widening federal antitrust investigation, Sotheby's, the leading worldwide auction house, yesterday announced the resignations of A. Alfred Taubman, its major shareholder, as chairman and Diana D. Brooks, arguably the most powerful woman in the art world, as president and chief executive. Michael I. Sovern, a legal scholar and a former president of Columbia University, will replace Mr. Taubman, and William F. Ruprecht, managing director of Sotheby's North and South America since 1994, will take over Ms. Brooks's jobs. The resignations, which came after a board meeting conducted by phone, rocked an art world already shaken by the criminal inquiry and left open questions about the future of the company, including the possible sale of Mr. Taubman's interests, and the high-end auction business in general.
2000-02-22	A Visible Chief Has a Head for Numbers	Diana D. Brooks, known as Dede, is said to have such a keen head for numbers that she can calculate auction totals faster than Sotheby's computers. Ms. Brooks, 49, joined the auction house 13 years ago from Citibank, where she had been a lending officer. While she had no background in the arts, she began in Sotheby's finance department and worked her way through the ranks to become the first woman to be named president of an auction house.
2000-02-22	Calling In an Expert Troubleshooter	Michael I. Sovern, 68, Sotheby's newly appointed chairman, is no stranger to difficult situations. As a Columbia University law professor in 1968, he was named head of a faculty committee charged with mending relations among students, faculty, alumni and the people of New York after a wave of campus protests.
2000-02-22	A Flair for Retailing Is Applied to Art	A. Alfred Taubman, 75, is a real estate developer who has been given credit for the evolution of suburban shopping centers. But he is also an art collector and socialite, known from Manhattan to Southampton to London to Palm Beach for his luxuriant lifestyle. Mr. Taubman made his fortune and business designing and building upscale shopping centers in affluent communities like Short Hills, N.J., and Stamford, Conn. He expanded his billion-dollar empire in 1983 when he bought Sotheby's, thereby marrying his lifelong passion for art with his skill as a retailer and developer.
2000-02-21	Sotheby's and Christie's Face Mounting Suits in Antitrust Case	In the art world Herbert Black is known as a man who loves paintings and antiques and loathes the auction houses where he buys and sells them. Suddenly he has a lot of company. Mr. Black, a copper trader from Montreal, is suing the two major art auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's. So is a philanthropist who endowed an Arizona art museum. And a New York businesswoman once known as the Tugboat Empress. And a Minnesota art gallery. And a Florida retiree. And about three dozen other people, some of whom may have simply bought a wristwatch or sold a great aunt's antique commode.
2000-02-18	INSIDE ART	Small Panel, Great Surprise When Richard Charlton-Jones was cataloging some old master paintings at Benacre Hall, a Palladian villa near Lowestoft in Suffolk, England, he spotted a small wood panel painted with a Madonna and Child flanked by a pair of angels. It was small, measuring only 8 by 10 inches, and was painted on gold ground. Mr. Charlton-Jones, a director of the old master paintings department at Sotheby's in London, said he found the work a bit perplexing. ''It was obviously very old and rare,'' he said. ''I took it back to London and began researching it.''
2000-02-17	An Old Master Sold at Auction Raises Doubts; Sotheby's Did Not Report Concerns About Authenticity	It was such a classic tale of rags to riches that Oprah Winfrey featured it. So did the ''Today'' show. A 500-year-old painting that had been lying face down in the attic of a Massachusetts rectory, a work that a parishioner had described as ''huge, gold and gaudy,'' turned out to be worth $1 million. Experts at Sotheby's auction house estimated that the painting, believed to be by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea del Sarto, would sell for $1 million to $1.5 million. At an important sale of old master paintings on Jan. 28, it went for $1.1 million, a record price for the artist. But at that point the tale begins to unravel. Before the sale Sotheby's failed to disclose that in early December the leading expert on del Sarto, John Shearman, had written to experts in Sotheby's old masters department to say that he believed the painting was not wholly by the artist.
2000-02-08	Christie's Is Changing Its Fees in Face of Suits and U.S. Investigation	Faced with class-action lawsuits and a three-year-old antitrust investigation into possible collusion between Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's two largest auction houses, Christie's announced yesterday that it was changing the fees it charges buyers and sellers. In much the same way airlines give frequent fliers incentives to maintain a loyal customer base, Christie's will now give customers who buy a lot of art cheaper rates when they sell art. Previously, sellers paid a fixed scale of charges ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent based upon the value of the property sold at Christie's during a calendar year.
2000-02-04	INSIDE ART	Auctioneers Trading Up With Sotheby's and Christie's preoccupied with the Justice Department's criminal antitrust investigation, Phillips, the world's third largest auction house, is busy trying to make itself more visible. With deep pockets provided by Bernard Arnault, the French investor who bought the company in November, it is scouring Manhattan for bigger, splashier premises. Phillips owns a building on 79th Street between First and York Avenues, but it is a small space, with only one combined gallery and salesroom. ''Finding an ideal auction site in New York is a nightmare,'' said Dan Klein, Phillips's international executive director. ''It took Christie's years to find Rockefeller Center.''
2000-02-02	Christie's and Sotheby's Named in Suit	Christie's Inc., the New York subsidiary of the No. 1 auction house in the world, and its rival Sotheby's Holdings, the world's No. 2 house, conspired to fix the commissions that each company would charge their customers, a class-action lawsuit says. The suit came a few days after Christie's International, the London-based parent of Christie's Inc., said it was cooperating with an investigation by the Justice Department into commission fixing in the international art market.
2000-01-31	A Thriving Market For Old Masters; Action Shifts to New York From London	Five museums -- the Metropolitan Museum, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the St. Louis Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art -- bought old master paintings at Christie's on Thursday. On Friday an anonymous donor bought a rare Rembrandt drawing for the Morgan Library at Christie's sale of old master drawings. And two American museums were buyers at Sotheby's sale of old master paintings on Friday: the National Gallery and an institution that wished to remain anonymous. At both auction houses museums were willing to pay record prices for works that would fill gaps in their collections. Sotheby's paintings sale brought in $47.4 million, while Christie's paintings sale totaled $39.2 million. Bidding in the salesrooms for the most popular works was fiercely competitive, with dealers from all over the world raising their paddles and telephone bidders aggressively trying to buy something, no matter what the price. Experts from both auction houses said there were more new buyers in these sales than ever before.
2000-01-29	Christie's Says It Is Cooperating With Antitrust Inquiry in Art World	Christie's, the worldwide auction house, said yesterday that it had given federal investigators information about ''possible conduct'' at the firm that was relevant to an antitrust investigation in the art world. In exchange for its cooperation, the company was ''conditionally accepted'' into a Department of Justice amnesty program, according to a statement by the company's general counsel, Jo Backer Laird. She said the conduct had taken place before new ownership took over a year and a half ago.
2000-01-16	Keeping a High Tone at Christie's	EVERY morning when Edward Dolman goes to work, he has to fight his way through the throngs outside the NBC studio windows as fans try to catch a glimpse of Katie Couric or Matt Lauer on the ''Today'' set. Mr. Dolman slips through unnoticed as he heads to a fifth-floor office with views of Rockefeller Center's Art Deco towers and its skating rink. In the auction and art world, however, where Mr. Dolman has worked for 16 years, his celebrity is growing. On Christmas Eve, Christie's sent an e-mail message to its staff announcing that he would be its new chief executive. While the name of Mr. Dolman, a sandy-haired Briton who had risen through the ranks at Christie's, had been bandied about within the company as a possible successor to Christopher Davidge, its chief for six years, many of its clients had never heard of him.
2000-01-13	PUBLIC LIVES	Ladies and Germs? The Ladies Win DONALD J. TRUMP has said that one potential drawback to a political career is shaking hands -- he is all but phobic about germs. But he showed no reluctance about throwing his arms around 32 beauty-pageant contestants in their low-cut pink satin gowns on Tuesday.
2000-01-13	Low Estimates Luring Bidders To Auction Rooms	WHEN the Nathaniel Appleton silver-mounted secretary sold a year ago for $8.3 million -- after an estimate by Sotheby's of $500,000 to $800,000 -- newcomers to the auction game may have been shellshocked, but the pros were not. When most of the other major items of Americana went for prices well above their pre-sale estimates, these newcomers sighed, picked up their inked-up catalogs and headed for home. ''I've seen them bewildered, with their mouths open and their hands empty,'' said Carol Prisant, a decorative arts writer and former antiques appraiser. ''Right now, there are a whole lot of inexperienced people who are going away disillusioned with the auction process. The tyro gets no explanation. Only the old hands really know what's going on.''
2000-01-09	Carved Birds Captured by a Connoisseur's Eye	AS a boy, James M. McCleery hunted ducks, geese and shorebirds with his father, a mailman, near their home in Edmond, a suburb of Oklahoma City, mostly to put food on their table. ''He loved birds and animals,'' said his daughter Karen Lynn McCleery. ''As a teenager he performed minor surgery on birds to help them. He bred peregrine falcons for a research project in preservation. To house them, he had our garage converted into a birdhouse, complete with running water, humidifiers and air-conditioning. And he left his car outside. When the falcons weren't soaring in the wild, the garage was falcon heaven. Once, when a falcon broke its beak, he fashioned a new one. Much later, after we were grown and gone, he also raised land turtles. He was never a one-trick pony.''
1999-12-24	In Rectory Attic, A del Sarto	In the early decades of this century, Clara Winthrop, a parishioner at All Saints Episcopal Church in West Newbury, Mass., bequeathed a painting of a Madonna and Child to the church. Until recently, officials at All Saints thought it was a copy of a work by Andrea del Sarto, the Italian old master painter and draftsman, and that it dated from around 1800. The painting, an oil on panel, hung in the choir stall until about 20 years ago, when it was stored in the rectory attic. Curious to know exactly what they had, church officials called in Christopher T. Apostle, senior vice president in the old master paintings department at Sotheby's, to examine the painting.

The cab, which has traveled 994,050 miles, about 40 times the circumference of the earth, belonged to its original owner and driver, Earl Johnson, who retired in July and moved to Montego Bay, Jamaica.
1999-12-14	Van Gogh Drawing Fills a Gap at the Modern	The Museum of Modern Art, which abruptly lost its only two van Gogh drawings last year, once again has one in its collection. The museum's chairman, Ronald Lauder bought an unusually large and turbulent van Gogh drawing of olive trees last week at Sotheby's in London for $8.5 million, a record price for a van Gogh drawing. The museum's director, Glenn D. Lowry, confirmed the gift from Mr. Lauder. The drawing will go on view early in the new year, museum aides said.
1999-12-10	INSIDE ART	Multiple Mysteries A Cezanne still life with an unusual past sold for $29.3 million on Tuesday night at Sotheby's in London. ''Pewter Pitcher and Fruit'' (1888-90) was stolen 21 years ago from Dr. Harry Bakwin, a child psychologist in New York who was a major Cezanne collector. The painting was recovered recently after Lloyd's, the London insurance exchange, approached the Art Loss Register, an international database for stolen and missing art and antiques.
1999-12-01	Sotheby's and Wine Dealer End Auction Arrangement	After five years of auctioning fine and rare wines together, Sherry-Lehmann and Sotheby's have parted company. The split was announced Monday, nine days after a two-day sale that brought in $14.4 million, setting a world record for wine auctions by eclipsing a 1997 Christie's sale in London that realized $11.3 million.
1999-11-26	A New Fair And a New View On 'Boundaries'	You don't have to wait until the millennium for the 20th century to be reinvented. It's happening tomorrow. The International 20th-Century Arts Fair, which is at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue at 67th Street tomorrow through Wednesday, may be the first ''antiques'' fair with contemporary works of art and design. ''It's a psychological thing,'' said Brian Haughton, an organizer of the fair. ''As we go over the cusp of the next millennium, people suddenly see what was made in this century as antique.'' David Revere McFadden, chief curator of the American Craft Museum and the author of an essay in the show's catalog, said: ''It's a crossover show where the normal boundaries between fields are not being paid attention to. It may be the first time that contemporary craft, industrial design and fine art from the turn of the century up to the present are being shown on the same level.''

1999-11-12	Modigliani Sells High, But Auction Falls Short	Auction fatigue set in at Sotheby's last night on the week's fourth consecutive evening auction. The atmosphere in the York Avenue salesroom reflected tired buyers' determination to control the proceedings and not get carried away. The tightly edited hourlong auction ended with strong results, but not as strong as the auction house had hoped. Sotheby's managed to sell $144.2 million worth of Impressionist and modern art, less than its low estimate of $150.3 million. Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive worldwide, said it was Sotheby's highest total since 1990. Of the 45 works offered, 36 sold.
1999-11-11	Picasso Tops Himself, Dominating Sotheby's Sale	In what became a one-painting sale last night at Sotheby's, Picasso's ''Seated Woman in a Garden'' sold for $49.5 million, the second highest price ever paid for a Picasso. Tobias Meyer, the evening's auctioneer, opened the bidding at $30 million, and soon three telephones were going strong at $44 million. ''I'm going to sell it soon,'' Mr. Meyer told members of the audience, who sat silent, in rapt attention. The painting was finally sold to the bidder on the phone with Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive worldwide, for well above its estimate of $40 million. After the sale, Sotheby's said the buyer wished to remain anonymous.

1999-11-04	Stars on the Walls, And in Sellers' Eyes; Hopes of a Boom Drive Fall Auctions	Just as analysts on Wall Street try to predict cycles in the stock market, collectors and dealers try to track peaks and valleys in the art market. So the fact that this month's important auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art will include many works owned by individuals hoping to cash in on the recent strong prices has insiders wondering whether this season's sales can top the 80's boom. Starting on Monday night, more than $400 million worth of art by such masters as Picasso, Monet, van Gogh and Degas will be offered by Sotheby's and Christie's in two marathon spurts concluding nine days later.

She had a clear idea of what she wanted -- a painting of flowers by any American artist. She was willing to spend about $4,000. The galleries did not seem to want her money. '' 'That's not the way to buy art,' '' she said they had told her. ''You are supposed to look at the art, and it's supposed to talk to you.' '' As she recalled this advice, her face registered what she thought of it.

One of the most dazzling examples of American japanning is a William and Mary high chest that Sotheby's is selling today. Made in Boston between 1712 and 1725, the black chest, Lot 107, sits on a tablelike base fitted with drawers.

1999-10-03	2,000 Photos From a Little Shop of Rarities in Paris	FOR decades, curators, collectors and dealers from throughout the world came here to an antiquarian bookshop on the Left Bank, the Librairie P. Jammes, where they climbed the circular staircase to meet the owners, Andre Jammes and his wife, Marie-Therese. They came to share the couple's expertise on photography, a private passion that they pursued for more than 40 years, forming one of the finest collections anywhere. Now, after a series of gifts and sales of their treasures to the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Musee d'Orsay in Paris as well as to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Jammeses have sent to auction much of what is left of their ''magnificent obsession,'' said Philippe Garner, the director of the photography department at Sotheby's in London. Thirty of the most important photographs and albums are on exhibit through Tuesday at Sotheby's in New York. The sale of the collection, 2,000 images in 280 lots, will take place on Oct. 27 in London. Sotheby's expects that the sale will total as much as $4.8 million, a record at auction for photography.

1999-09-26	Bringing the Party to Sotheby's	IT was nearly 11 P.M., and Tiffany Dubin was seated at a vanity table on a hot-pink velvet chair in the dressing room of her Upper East Side apartment, wearing a baby-doll nightgown. Her day had begun with meetings at Sotheby's, where she is the head of the fashion department, continued with an afternoon trip to Chinatown to buy bar stools and after a quick change into a 1960's Norman Norell dress, wound down at a business dinner at Fressen in the meatpacking district. But even though her makeup had long since worn off and the flip of her brunet bob had gone limp, Ms. Dubin seemed to be getting her second wind. ''I'm a workaholic,'' she said perkily. ''I have to hide it from my husband. It's a problem. I'll put him to sleep at 11:30 and then go on the Internet to buy plexiglass display cases for my sale.''

Bidders dressed in suits worth the price of a 1913 Chief Bender Philadelphia Athletics jersey (it went for $24,000 last night) sat beside hopeful Yankee fans in worn-out T-shirts that weren't worth the price of a program here last night. Sotheby's played host to the auction of the Barry Halper Collection of Baseball Memorabilia, the holy grail that most collectors can only dream of, filled with items that Halper, now a limited partner with the Yankees, has accumulated from players he befriended more than 50 years. Last night was the first of 16 sessions spanning seven days in which 2,481 items will be auctioned, with over 5,000 more lots scheduled to be sold over the Internet in November at www.Sothebys.Amazon.com.
1999-09-19	Word for Word/Baseball Memorabilia; Going, Going, Gone on the Block: Artifacts of American Myth	DURING the half-century in which he accumulated the finest private collection of baseball memorabilia in the world -- rivaling that of the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. -- Barry Halper was never satisfied with gathering such conventional mementoes as autographed bats and balls. The Livingston, N.J., resident craved artifacts that told stories, from the contract that sold Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox to the New York Yankees to a jar of Vaseline signed by the spitballer Gaylord Perry, from George Brett's ''pine-tar'' home run baseball to the shotgun Ty Cobb's mother used to kill his father. For estate-planning purposes, Halper, 60, is auctioning off most of his collection in seven days of bidding at Sotheby's in Manhattan beginning this Thursday. Hundreds of documents, many of them letters from players like Ruth and Cobb, capture episodes of baseball history better than any press-box raconteur. Here are excerpts. ALAN SCHWARZ
1999-09-07	A Lull in Art Sales? Well, Not Anymore; New Collectors Are Changing the Market	Like Broadway, baseball and big-game hunting, the art trade has always had a season. It began in mid-September, rose to heights each fall and again each spring, then tailed off at the end of June, when rich collectors headed for a summer of leisure at their country homes. ''August,'' said Arnold Glimcher, the chairman of the Pace Wildenstein Gallery, ''was a time when you could pull in the sidewalk, and some galleries would even close for the whole month.'' Certainly, big-name dealers left town, leaving skeleton crews in charge of their galleries.
1999-09-05	The Baseball Treasures He Just Can't Part With	THE nearly 80,000 items of baseball memorabilia -- from the gorgeously historic to the madly esoteric -- that filled the comfortable home of Barry Halper in Livingston, N.J., have mostly been packed up and shipped out. About 20 percent of his collection was sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame, where a wing named for this collector non pareil has been built. Most of the rest of the collection will be sold at a weeklong auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan, begining on Sept. 23, which, according to Sotheby's, has a chance to break the house record of $34.4 million set by the sale of the Jackie Kennedy Onassis estate. But in Mr. Halper's home, some things remain the same. He was unable to part with some items of value, for sentimental reasons. He was also unable to part with some items of perhaps little economic value, for the same heart-plucking reasons. He has held on to books and photographs signed ''To my friend, Barry Halper'' from the likes of Joe DiMaggio and George Brett, a lock of Babe Ruth's hair, a rubber glove once used by a doctor to examine Mickey Mantle, to name a few.
1999-08-06	Fine Art, Precious Bikes: Sotheby's Hopes to Sell a $500,000 Motorcycle	IT was bound to happen: Sotheby's, the auction house known for selling objets d'art, plans a sale of high-performance and vintage motorcycles, its first in North America, on Sept. 13 in Chicago. Sotheby's Chicago showroom will feature about 100 motorcycles from around the world, as well as 150 antique and vintage bicycles and related memorabilia. The sale will be led by a number of Italian-made Ducati motorcycles, including some famous racing machines, street bikes, racing memorabilia, parts and champions' racing leathers. Items will be exhibited on Monday through Thursday the week of the auction.
1999-07-05	In London, an Index of Hunger for the Choice Art Morsel	Four disappointed bidders were prepared to spend more than $24 million on a Degas pastel at Sotheby's here last week in a telling sign about today's art market: there is plenty of money to be spent but not enough great works to spend it on. During last week's back-to-back auctions of Impressionist, contemporary and modern art, high prices were consistently paid. In some cases the prices were well deserved. The Degas, ''Dancer in Repose,'' an 1879 image of a dancer sitting on a bench massaging her foot, was one of the week's exceptional works. It had not been for sale for 104 years and had never been exhibited outside France. The pastel, which was expected to sell for $8 million, broke all records for Degas, selling to an unidentified telephone bidder for $27.9 million, more than three times its estimate.
1999-06-30	FOOTLIGHTS	NEWS Coming Home The 16-city Whitney Houston World Tour '99, which began in Chicago on June 22, pulls into Newark, the star's birthplace, on Saturday for a single performance at 8 P.M. in Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. Besides her classic hits, Ms. Houston, on her first tour in five years, will perform songs from her latest album, ''My Love Is Your Love.''
1999-06-23	Salinger Letters Are Sold And May Return to Sender	The saga of the hermitic author, the confessional writer, the love letters and the auction block came full circle yesterday and ended, at least in theory, happily for everyone. Fourteen letters written 27 years ago by J. D. Salinger to Joyce Maynard, a young writer and star-struck admirer, were sold at Sotheby's for $156,500 to the software entrepreneur and art collector Peter Norton. Mr. Norton then announced that he was going to return them to Mr. Salinger.
1999-06-18	A Recluse Meets His Match	IF you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is what, word for word, is in those seductive letters that the middle-aged J.D. Salinger sent in 1972 and '73 to the young Joyce Maynard. Can't help you there, kiddo, even after reading them. Copyright laws make direct quotations impossible.
1999-06-17	Sotheby's and Amazon.com Strike a Deal to Sell on Line	Five months after announcing a $25 million plan to begin its own on-line auction business, Sotheby's has entered into an alliance with Amazon.com to begin selling art and collectibles later this year. The arrangement, announced yesterday, combines Amazon's on-line expertise and broad customer reach with Sotheby's reputation as an authority in the business of selling fine and decorative arts.
1999-06-16	Sotheby's and Amazon Join On Internet Auction Site	Five months after Sotheby's announced a $25 million initiative to begin its own on-line auction business, it has entered into an alliance with Amazon.com. The two will begin selling art and collectibles later this year. The arrangement merges Amazon's on-line expertise and broad customer reach with Sotheby's reputation as an authority in the business of selling fine and decorative arts. ''We are bringing to the table technology, customer service and an introduction to 10 million people,'' said Jeff Bezas, founder and chief executive officer of Amazon.com. ''One of the biggest problems in the on-line auction business is the ability to authenticate what we sell and that's something Sotheby's can help us do. There's no other partner out there that could help us build this.''
1999-06-13	Auctioning Off the Treasures of Ralph Kramden and Scarlett	What price memory? How much of today's cash does it take to own a vestige of yesterday's passion? For someone else's Oscar, Michael Jackson paid $1,542,500 at Sotheby's yesterday. The singer's winning bid, for the gold-plated Best Picture statuette awarded in 1939 to the producer David O. Selznick for ''Gone With the Wind,'' dwarfed the previous Oscar auction record of $607,500 paid in 1996.
1999-06-04	INSIDE ART	Circus Parade Hid Another When conservators at the Phillips Collection in Washington began cleaning and restoring Gifford Beal's ''Parade of Elephants,'' they made an astonishing discovery: beneath the 1924 painting was another canvas on the same stretcher, where it had been hidden for 75 years. Elizabeth Steele, the Phillips's chief conservator, and Gillian Cook, an intern in the conservation department, had begun work on ''Parade of Elephants'' to prepare for ''Renoir to Rothko: The Eye of Duncan Phillips,'' an exhibition that opens at the Phillips on Sept. 25 and explores the collection of the museum's founder.
1999-05-30	Extravagant Fantasies a Collector Made Real	STORIES abound of millionaires with surly tempers, put-on airs and bad taste. Few stories, however, tell of anyone like Carlos de Beistegui, an international dandy whose character flaws were myriad but whose esthetic sense caused him to be widely admired as a rich man who deserved to be rich. ''Certainly he was selfish, difficult and snobbish, which can be said about many successful men and women,'' said Marcus Linell, a senior director of Sotheby's, which is dispersing the contents of Chateau de Groussay, the circa-1815 house near Paris that was Beistegui's home from 1939 until his death in 1970 at 74. ''But Charlie Beistegui was that rare thing: a rich man whose fantasies were not only extraordinarily beautiful but who actually realized them.''
1999-05-23	A NIGHT OUT WITH: Kim Heirston; Meet, Greet, Buy, Sell	I KNOW being fabulous is a full-time occupation,'' Gregory Crewdson, an artist, said recently. ''But what exactly does she do?'' That seems to be the $100,000 question whenever Kim Heirston's name is mentioned. Neither a collector nor a dealer, Ms. Heirston, 35, is an art adviser, coaching the rich on how to spend their fortunes on fine art.
1999-05-19	Classics From 60's Are Big Draw at Sotheby's Sale	Strong examples of classic contemporary artists -- household names like Warhol, Calder and Bacon -- were snapped up in short order at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art in Manhattan last night. ''People came to shop,'' said Christophe van de Weghe, a Manhattan dealer who works at the Gagosian Gallery. ''Buyers knew what they wanted.''
1999-05-16	A Man Who Traded Everything for an Indian Trove	AT 15, Frank T. Siebert Jr. became so frustrated at not finding the books he wanted to read on American Indians and the Western frontier in school or at the public libraries in Philadelphia that he began collecting. His first purchase, a 1904 reprint of John Eliot's ''Logick Primer,'' from 1672, cost 28 cents. Over the next 70 years, he became a pathologist, sold his blood to buy books, got married, then left his wife and children and lived for a while in his car. He sometimes paid dearly for the works he relentlessly tracked. ''Frank Siebert's story bears every mark of the fanatic collector,'' said the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who first met Siebert in the late 1930's, when both were students at the University of Pennsylvania.
1999-05-16	Applauding the Art, or Maybe the Money	To the Editor: A May 11 Arts pages article reports that when Cezanne's ''Still Life With Curtain, Pitcher and Bowl of Fruit'' sold for $60.6 million at Sotheby's, ''the salesroom burst into applause.''
1999-05-16	Temptation, Temptation At Auction Houses	Auction houses -- especially their wine departments -- are outdoing the Vegas casinos in coddling customers. To stir interest in its wine sale on Saturday, Sotheby's is offering a chance to taste some of the best offerings on Friday night. Similarly, its rival, Christie's, held a dinner at its new Rockefeller Center quarters the night before its May 6 and 7 wine sales; according to one executive, the dinner cost about $50,000, or more than $700 for each of 68 guests.
1999-05-12	Mystery Bidder Pushes Up Prices at Sotheby's Impressionist Auction	A mystery telephone bidder known only to the audience as L036 went on a wild shopping spree at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art last night, spending nearly $25 million for three Monets, a Rodin, a Sisley and a Signac. That was all it took to push prices for some offerings way above what many experts said they were worth. That's not to say the evening was a total success. There were eerily quiet stretches where the crowded salesroom went dead. Then there were moments of tension, when several buyers were determined to bring something home, no matter what the cost.
1999-05-12	Love Letters in the Wind; A Private Affair of the Famously Private Salinger	Fourteen letters by J. D. Salinger, the most private of literary figures, are about to be auctioned in the must public of arenas -- Sotheby's New York -- in a move likely to raise vexing questions about the private rights of public figures. The letters were written between April 25, 1972, and Aug. 17, 1973, to the writer Joyce Maynard, with whom Mr. Salinger had a nine-month romance. It began when she was an 18-year-old Yale University freshman and he was a celebrated 53-year-old author who had retreated from public life to an isolated cottage in Cornish, N.H.
1999-05-11	A Cezanne Leads a $128 Million Auction of the Whitney Art Collection	Sotheby's made a perfect score last night when it sold all 50 works from one of the world's fabled art collections: an exceptional group of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculptures from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney. The evening totaled $128.3 million, far above its $90 million high estimate, making it the second-highest single-owner auction in history. At the packed York Avenue salesroom, new money did its best to capture a piece of one of America's most patrician names in collecting and one of the most important groups of Impressionist and modern masters still in private hands.
1999-05-07	INSIDE ART	Lost Treasure To Be Auctioned A haunting landscape by the Hudson River School master Frederic Edwin Church is being offered for sale at Sotheby's on May 27. The painting, which features a cross in the foreground, comes with an unusual past.
1999-05-06	Whitney Estate Sweetens Spring Art Sales	The round of important fine-art auctions that begins at Sotheby's in Manhattan on Monday evening might be described as a play in two acts. The first act could be called ''The Auctioneer's Dream'': the collection of extraordinary Post-Impressionist paintings from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the New York socialite and philanthropist who died in March. The Whitney collection, blockbuster material of pristine provenance, should make for a near-perfect auction on Monday. The second act, which includes two more sales at Sotheby's and three at Christie's, could be labeled ''The Harsh Realities of the Art Market.'' The offerings add up to a patchy selection of works by major 19th- and 20th-century artists like Monet and Renoir, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. These underscore the scarcity of great art available. And that helps make the Whitney sale a major event.
1999-04-30	INSIDE ART	Old Masters, New Focus In 1961 the Samuel H. Kress Foundation gave more than $1 billion worth of European art to American museums, universities and colleges. Now, as this New York-based foundation is approaching its 75th anniversary, it is starting a program to encourage institutions to explain the origins of European art in imaginative ways.
1999-04-24	Rare Blake Book Sells for $2.5 Million at Sotheby's	A rare, magnificently illustrated, hand-printed copy of ''The First Book of Urizen'' by William Blake, which has been hidden away in a private collection for more than 50 years, was sold yesterday at Sotheby's New York for $2.5 million. The 1794 volume, auctioned as part of the estate of Mrs. John Hay Whitney, is believed to be one of only eight complete surviving copies of the book printed by the visionary English Romantic poet and artist. It was bought by a private collector who made the bid by telephone.
1999-04-22	PUBLIC LIVES	Raising Voices About Noises In case you hadn't heard, International Noise Awareness Day was yesterday. At bus and train stations around New York City, volunteers distributed brochures on hearing loss and its prevention, complete with packets of ear plugs.
1999-04-20	Patterns	Shades of Anna Sui Lots of designers have fragrances, but how many have a full line of color cosmetics? There's Yves Saint Laurent. There's Versace. And now there is Anna Sui, who is introducing her collection of lipstick, nail polish, eyeshadow, mascara and more tomorrow at Saks Fifth Avenue.
1999-04-14	The Photographic Treasures of a Secret Collector	Before he died suddenly last year at 81 of a heart attack, David Feigenbaum led the secret life of a collector of Citizen Kane-like obsessiveness. He filled almost every inch of his two-story house in Marblehead, Mass., with things, including books, guns, model boats, Civil War and World War II paraphernalia and an old Scottish Bible collection. In the basement, together with old manuscripts, historic letters, coins and jewelry, was an extraordinary cache of mid-19th-century daguerreotypes, including more than 200 made by Southworth & Hawes of Boston, a recognized master of the form. Most daguerreotypes come in small sizes, but 70 of the pieces in the Feigenbaum collection are extremely hard to find whole plates, measuring 6 1/2 by 8 1/2 inches. The studio's partners, Albert S. Southworth and Josiah J. Hawes, were famous for making portraits marked by a radiant naturalness and artistry. And their studio drew Boston's cultured elite, much as Nadar's in Paris became the gathering place for that city's intellectuals.
1999-04-09	INSIDE ART	Chinese Treasures Chinese art has attracted a flurry of attention recently. Over the last two years the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, have given it considerable time and space. Now the National Gallery of Art in Washington is weighing in.
1999-04-02	INSIDE ART	Making Good On a Promise For the last 11 years, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art has been little more than a name and a promise. But on May 30, it will finally open to the public, and North Adams, Mass., will be the site of the largest center for contemporary visual and performing arts in the United States.
1999-03-26	Dizzying Realm Of Asian Art	''Asia'' doesn't exist and it never has. It isn't a place or culture; it's a geopolitical fiction, a patchwork of people, climates and languages stitched together lightly, and only here and there, by the bright thread of Buddhism. Yet something called ''Asian art'' has taken New York by subtle force in the last few years, sweeping aside cultural and political distinctions. Its presence is especially evident during these early spring days, in what has come to be known in the art world as Asia Week.
1999-03-12	Grand Decor On the Block	Many people think it's news when a prominent interior designer acts to redo his space. Alberto Pinto, the veteran Paris decorator, is making news by deciding to un-do his space. ''He is one of the best five decorators in Paris,'' said Laure de Gramont, a former editor of Paris Vogue who is now an international book scout. ''He has to keep reinventing his decor, just as Hubert de Givenchy and Karl Lagerfeld have done recently. Creative people get bored with their old things.''
1999-03-05	Dispersing Treasures for A Good Cause	Giuseppe Rossi of Turin, Italy, was famous for his connoisseurship, but he will be remembered for his generosity. Next week Sotheby's in London is selling Mr. Rossi's collection, approximately 1,400 spectacular lots of 18th-century furniture, Meissen porcelain, Italian silver and Chinese ceramics, with the proceeds of the sale promised to a school of conservation and restoration of the decorative arts, the Scuola per Artigiani Restauratori d'Arte, in Turin. The collection, amassed between 1945 and 1979, is expected to bring about $15 million, said Mario Tavella, Sotheby's furniture specialist in London.
1999-03-05	Real Squabble Over Real Estate	Although he is 91, retirement is not in the cards for Leo Castelli. On April 17, Mr. Castelli, the art dealer, is to open a new space at 59 East 79th Street, Manhattan, just two blocks from 4 East 77th Street, where he began in 1957. The inaugural exhibition will be devoted to monotypes by Jasper Johns, one of Mr. Castelli's longtime artists. ''A lot is happening on the Upper East Side again,'' said Barbara Castelli, Mr. Castelli's wife, who works with him. ''There are a lot of other galleries in the neighborhood and hotels where collectors from all over the world come to stay.''
1999-02-11	Oh, the Tales A Secretary Could Tell!	ONE afternoon last month, Leslie Keno, the director of the American furniture department at Sotheby's, waited in the main auction room for the sale of lot 704, a rare and important secretary bookcase that he hoped would highlight the bidding that day. As an employee of Sotheby's for 18 years and as one of the experts on the popular PBS program ''Antiques Roadshow,'' Mr. Keno, 41, has examined as many as 100,000 objects in his life. But none had ever affected him the way this one did. Its great rarity, its superb craftsmanship and its strange beauty all seduced and mesmerized him. ''It was hard to take my eyes off of it,'' Mr. Keno recalled. ''I had never seen anything this magnificent in my career. I would come into the room where we had it on display and find myself drawn to the piece. It had that effect on you.''
1999-01-31	Sharp-Eyed Collectors Drive Up the Price of Folk Art	OUTSIDER art continues to upstage American folk art in gallery and museum exhibitions as well as in the press. But at the auctions, traditional American folk art chalks up spectacular prices for the choicest examples, while the quirky, visionary Outsider art lags far behind in prices fetched at auction. This month's folk-art sales began with the proverbial bang at Christie's when two extraordinary paintings by Edward Hicks rewrote the records for the artist and for folk art. The first painting, ''The Residence of David Twining,'' which had never been on the market previously, was sold by Dr. Thomas Lincoln, a descendant of Twining and of Abraham Lincoln, for $1.4 million. Seconds later, a second painting, ''Peaceable Kingdom,'' from 1837, was sold for $4.7 million to Richard York, a New York dealer. The total sales of folk art at Christie's was $9.3 million and $2.6 million at Sotheby's.
1999-01-29	A Mistress For the Frick	Regular visitors to the Frick Collection will notice some changes to the grand interiors of the limestone mansion at 1 East 70th Street. Several paintings in its collection that had been out of sight for years were rehung this week in prominent places. Some of the Frick's fine porcelains, too, have found temporary new niches. The purpose of the reinstallation is to create a mini-exhibition that revolves around a single loan: Drouais's full-length portrait of Madame de Pompadour from the National Gallery in London. It is the first time the Drouais has been seen in the United States.
1999-01-27	Old Auction Rivalry Jumps to Internet	In an apparent attempt to undermine its archrival Christie's entry into the potentially lucrative on-line auction business, Sotheby's is asking art dealers to sign exclusive contracts that would prevent them from selling wares through other auction houses on the Internet for at least two years. The effort comes as the two famous auction houses have moved to enter the world of cyberspace, seeking a potentially rich new marketplace to sell the high-end goods that have been their traditional franchise. Sotheby's announced on Jan. 19 that it would begin selling some items on line, while Christie's followed with a similar announcement yesterday.
1999-01-20	Protecting Bidders on Line	For the moment, Internet auctions are no better -- or no worse -- than giant electronic garage sales, in which thousands of potential buyers can look at a photograph of an item but cannot inspect it, or consult an independent expert to verify the item's quality or authenticity. Nonetheless, people buy and sell things on line every day, from toys to Lincoln artifacts, especially on the largest Internet auction service of its kind, eBay, whose site is at http://www.ebay.com/.
1999-01-20	Virtual Sky's the Limit for On-Line Auctions at Sotheby's Web Site	If the hottest auction market in the country right now is in cyberspace, why shouldn't Sotheby's get in on the action? Taking its cachet and gavel onto the Internet, the New York auction house said yesterday that it would spend $25 million on a site called sothebys.com, where the public will be able to bid on art, antiques, jewelry and collectibles like sports memorabilia.
1999-01-15	House Favorites: Old Masters	As with any good showman, Stephen A. Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, wants to please his audience. At Bellagio, his $1.6 billion hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas, Nev., some 2,000 visitors a day are willing to pay $10 to see the mini-museum that opened there in October. When Mr. Wynn learned that they preferred art by familiar traditional artists to some of the more difficult 20th-century works, he decided to make changes. In the last few months he has been revising his collection, selling works by such artists as Jasper Johns and Giacometti and buying Old Masters, stirring hopes among eager New York and London dealers in that field.
1999-01-15	Refinement And Status In Americana	The current adage that ''the best always sells'' will be tested this week at Americana sales when Sotheby's and Christie's offer a few antiques with the three prerequisites: rarity, condition and provenance. Tomorrow, Christie's is selling a magnificent Philadelphia Chippendale tilt-top tea table, circa 1760-70, in the auction of the collection of Mr. and Mrs. James L. Britton. Expected to go for $500,000 to $800,000, the table, which appears to be in fine condition, has a round scalloped top, known as a pie crust, with a rim divided into 10 curving segments.
1999-01-13	$80 Million Sale Is Set for Whitney Couple's Riches	For three days and two nights in April and May, Sotheby's could once again be the center of the kind of auction frenzy that surrounded its sale of items from the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1996 and the Duchess of Windsor last year. Yesterday the auction house announced that it would sell $80 million to $110 million worth of property from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the New York socialite and philanthropist who left more than $300 million worth of art by van Gogh, Matisse and Picasso and other masters to four major museums at her death in March. Among the art and objects that will be sold at Sotheby's this spring are a group of highly important Post-Impressionist paintings, including works by Cezanne and Seurat to be offered in a special evening sale on May 10. The property from Mrs. Whitney's five homes will be offered in a series of auctions from April 22 to 25.
1998-12-25	Nod to Olmsted And the Ice Age	The Public Art Fund has big plans for the southeast entrance to Central Park, officially known as the Doris C. Freedman Plaza. The nonprofit Art Fund has orchestrated projects like the water tower that the English artist Rachel Whiteread cast in resin and installed on a SoHo roof this summer. For the last year and a half, it has been working with Andrea Zittel, the American installation artist, on a project for the park. Ms. Zittel will create a series of faux-rock outcroppings, made in Palmyra, Va., with a steel infrastructure and layers of carefully painted concrete. The work, ''Point of Interest,'' will mimic the use of boulders by the park's original designer, Frederick Law Olmsted, and echo those in the nearby zoo.
1998-12-20	Silver Cups Don't Run Over	Victor Niederhoffer, the money manager who lost all his shirts last year, marvels that his silver-trophy collection barely fetched the price of a ''mediocre Impressionist painting.'' Sotheby's raised $2.6 million Tuesday, in the middle range of its estimate. ''Apples and oranges,'' Kevin Tierney, the Sotheby's silver guru, said of the comparison. ''Everybody, after all, can recognize a Renoir over the mantlepiece.''
1998-12-11	Antique Toys That Can Tell True Stories	F.A.O. Schwarz: Watch out. Attention: K-Mart shoppers. A world-class collection of antique toys can be seen today in New York and they are all for sale. But you'd better move fast; tomorrow is the day. That is when Sotheby's will auction 1,000 toys, dating from the 1870's to the 1950's, from the estate of Carol F. Andersen, the Andersen Windows heiress who died in 1992. Ms. Andersen and her husband, Bill Rubenstein, bought their toys from the 1960's to the mid-1980's.
1998-12-04	A Society Favorite's Many Talents	Christian Berard may not be a household name in the United States, but in the 1920's and 30's he was the Paris equivalent of Andy Warhol: a tortured, drug-taking but multitalented artist, versatile in many fields and a darling of society. With ''Decors Imaginaires,'' a current show of his gouaches at Rainbow Fine Art through Dec. 19, and seven drawings for sale in Sotheby's Dec. 9 auction of ''Dance, Theater, Opera'' designs, Berard is ripe for rediscovery. He was unbelievably facile, as good an easel painter as he was a creator of theater sets and costumes, fashion illustrations for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and murals for friends' houses. This ability has confused art critics trying to evaluate him, but his paintings are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Menil Collection in Houston and the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio.
1998-12-03	Sacred and Secular Clash at an Auction	An auction of American Indian art at Sotheby's in Manhattan turned out to be less of an auction than expected yesterday, after protests by several Indian tribes that argued that their cultural heritage should not be sold into private hands. Nineteen of the objects, including six that several tribes had asked to be removed from the auction block, were withdrawn by the auction house or the consignors for legal reasons.
1998-11-30	Aleut Sacred Objects to Be Auctioned at Sotheby's Despite Protests by the Tribe	Despite tribal protests, two pieces of Aleut Indian art will be included in an auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan on Wednesday, the auction house and the seller say. The tribe contends that part of its cultural heritage has been lost and should be restored. The seller contends that the objects, a wood mask dated between 1510 and 1660 and an early bentwood hunting hat, may well be better off in private hands.
1998-11-27	Of Sotheby's And Saints	Some people wonder whether there are too many new saints under consideration these days. There are also hundreds of saints most of us don't know about, like St. Rosalie of Palermo, the protector against plague, smallpox, typhoid and earthquakes; the Holy Child of Atocha, the patron of travelers who risk capture by non-Christian enemies, and St. Isidore the Plowman, the patron of rain and good crops. Stanley Marcus's collection of carved images of these saints and others, made in the 1800's by Hispanic colonists, native New Mexicans and American Indians in the Southwest, are coming up for auction at Sotheby's next week, and they give new meaning to the term ''folk art.'' The sale, on Dec. 2, consists of 159 items from the Marcus collection of Southwestern art, and is part of Sotheby's sale of ''Important American Indian Art.'' Mr. Marcus and his wife, Linda, bought the works -- American Indian, New Mexican Devotional and Latin American -- for their home in Santa Fe, N.M. They are now selling the house and the collection because Mr. Marcus, 93, is finding it difficult to live at the high altitude.
1998-11-22	$90.5 Million for Reader's Digest Art	TWO Modigliani portraits accounted for more than a fourth of the total of $90.5 million reaped over two days from the sale of Reader's Digest art at Sotheby's last week. On Monday, $86.5 million was gleaned from the sale of Impressionist artworks, and on Tuesday, in an offering of Modern works, the final total of $90.5 million included $4 million for a Richard Diebenkorn painting, a record for the artist. Sotheby's estimate of the entire Reader's Digest offering of 38 works had been $70 million to $100 million.
1998-11-20	The Modern Seeks Money	Gearing up for its major expansion, the Museum of Modern Art announced this week that it had begun a $650 million capital campaign. It is believed to be the largest fund-raising effort by any museum in the country and possibly by any American cultural institution. So far about $300 million has been raised, including $65 million from New York City, officials at the Modern said. Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani pledged that amount, to be paid over the next three years, in April for the new building, which is to rise on the site of the Dorset Hotel and adjacent brownstones. On Wednesday the Mayor confirmed a first payment of $15 million.
1998-11-18	Selective Spending at Contemporary-Art Auction	Buyers kept their feet firmly planted on the ground last night at Sotheby's auction of contemporary art. While six or seven people were often seen bidding on a work at once, buying seemed carefully controlled throughout the evening. Still, some pieces drew high prices, and records were set for artists including Richard Diebenkorn, Jeff Koons, Brice Marden and Martin Puryear. Even so, nobody lost his head. The sale totaled $42.2 million, less than Sotheby's estimate of $47 million to $65 million. Of the 83 works, 67 were sold.
1998-11-17	Art Owned by Reader's Digest Auctioned for $86 Million	Reality chilled the enthusiasm last night at Sotheby's in Manhattan, where 37 works from the Reader's Digest collection, being sold along with Impressionist and modern art from various owners, kicked off the first session of this week's four-night auction marathon. Despite the record-breaking crowds that packed Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters all weekend to see art by masters including Modigliani, Cezanne and Picasso, bidding in the jammed auction room was surprisingly thin, and the mood was somber. Of the 37 works from the financially troubled Reader's Digest Corporation, 33 were sold, and many just squeaked by their low estimates. The collection brought $86.5 million, about midway between its $70 million low estimate and its $100 million high.
1998-11-15	Reader's Digest Parts With Cherished Art	THE art auction scheduled for tomorrow and Tuesday nights at Sotheby's, when the Manhattan concern puts the renowned Reader's Digest Impressionist and Modern collection on the block, has been building suspense for nine weeks. Whatever fate awaits the 39 major works by Monet, Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani, Chagall and others, one thing is certain, said Charles S. Moffett, worldwide co-chairman of Sotheby's Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary department. The paintings, drawings and sculptures lovingly collected over three decades by Lila Acheson Wallace and her husband, DeWitt Wallace, the founders of Reader's Digest, will take less than an hour to sell, Mr. Moffett predicted. And when the hammer has rung down on the last painting, Richard Diebenkorn's ''Horizon-Ocean View,'' which will be offered separately in a sale of contemporary art on Tuesday, upward of $100 million may have changed hands.
1998-11-11	Coveted Collections Of Art At Auction	As Sotheby's and Christie's prepare for their big fall sales, which begin tomorrow night with Christie's sale of contemporary art, auction house experts are as concerned about the world financial markets as they are about the number of collectors prepared to buy art. More than any other segment of the art market, auctions rely on buyers' confidence. When the mood in a salesroom is buoyant, so are the prices. But nervousness can be equally contagious, making even those who came to bid get cold feet. That's not to say that the art market always mirrors the stock market. In 1987, just three weeks after the market plunge labeled Black Monday, Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art auction topped $100 million in sales for the first time in its history, a 45 percent increase from six months before. This season, while pessimists are saying that the problems in the economy are deeper and more widespread than in the last 11 years, auction house officials are trying to paint a rosy picture.
1998-11-08	Honoring Those Who Once Were Warriors	THE near-life-size wood carving of a Maori warrior exudes raw power. The eyes, made of shells, gleam white with seeming rage against the tatooed face, and the large, claw-like hands and the short, thick, muscular legs project brute strength. The figure depicts an ancestor of a Maori chief and symbolizes the pride of a tribe. Fierce and unhuggable as the figure may seem to Western eyes, it was anything but to the Maori. They eagerly caressed and embraced it, pressing their noses against its nose, in the belief that doing so put them in touch with their ancestor. Such showing of deep respect and affection for their forebears is still practiced by the Maori today.
1998-11-01	At Christie's, Master's in the House	Education has become the weapon of choice in the war between the two titans of the art market, Christie's and Sotheby's. Over the last decade, both auction houses have opened special divisions offering a range of courses about the history and appraisal of fine art and decorative objects. Both even offer advanced degrees in their London headquarters. Now Christie's in New York is touting a sheepskin of its own: this fall, 30 students began working toward their master's degrees in connoisseurship and the art market, a program designed for people who want to work in auction houses, galleries and museums. The program, accredited by the New York Board of Regents, includes classes on developments in painting and sculpture from 1850 to the present; business courses; and field trips to view public and private collections.
1998-10-23	Metro Business; Sotheby's Expands In Wine Auctions	In a move that is likely to increase its competitiveness in the expanding wine-auction market in the United States, Sotheby's has acquired Davis & Company, a five-year-old wine-auction house based in Chicago. Sotheby's declined to give the price of the purchase, which was announced this week. In partnership with Sherry-Lehmann, a carriage-trade wine shop, Sotheby's conducts auctions in New York City. Sotheby's, which has its headquarters in New York, also holds wine auctions on its own in Los Angeles.
1998-10-23	Saatchi Sells; Students Benefit	It has been a few years since Charles Saatchi has surfaced as a seller at an auction. But this week, Christie's in London announced that Mr. Saatchi, the advertising magnate who is also one of Britain's biggest contemporary art collectors, would be selling 130 works by 97 artists, together valued at $1.6 million, on Dec. 8. The proceeds will be used, in part, to set up a scholarship program to help pay for students' projects and commissions at four London art schools: Chelsea, Goldsmiths', the Royal College and the Slade. The money will also help finance the projects of young British artists who have left college. Members of this older group will show their work at Mr. Saatchi's London gallery on Boundary Road in the East End.

1998-10-18	A Farewell to Art	It could be even better than shopping at Neiman Marcus. Stanley Marcus, the retired chairman and his wife, Linda, an anthropologist, are selling their prime collection of Southwestern art at Sotheby's on Dec. 2. Mr. Marcus, 93, has sold the home in Santa Fe, N.M. that contained his trove. The 180 or so lots, including early New Mexican carvings of patron saints, textiles and furniture, are expected to bring $800,000 to $1 million. When he began collecting 50 years ago, he wondered about paying $75 for primitive wooden statues that sell today for tens of thousands of dollars. He has already donated parts of his Dallas collection to local museums, including a famed series of Japanese prints by Hiroshige that Frank Lloyd Wright had put up as collateral for a loan. ALLEN R.

1998-10-04	Sold!; New York Challenges London as the Hot Spot for Wine Auctions	CRACK. The hammer comes down on Lot 605, a 12-bottle case of 1987 Montrachet, a white Burgundy from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. It sells for $5,175. Probably petty cash for the anonymous buyer. At Sotheby's first wine auction of the new season, the Saturday morning crowd consists of eager novices and savvy drinkers, collectors, speculators, consultants, brokers, restaurateurs and sommeliers. Time for a quick lunch break. Pop. Pop. Bottles of 1990 Dom Perignon are opened in the board room, next to the auction room. One bottle costs $113.61, tax included, at Sherry-Lehmann on Madison Avenue. At Sotheby's, Sherry's auction partner, a glass of the deluxe Champagne is free for all auction patrons, a $16 gift. Some bidders scarf down two glasses. Admission to the auction is free, too.
1998-10-02	Antiques; Opening A Coveted Photo Album	Next week's major photography auctions at Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips and Swann Galleries may change the meaning of ''photo op.'' At these sales, the opportunities are for collectors, not shooters. One Manhattan photography dealer, Jill Quasha, estimates that the pictures for sale are worth $10 million. ''There's a plethora of marvelous material,'' agreed another dealer, Jonathan Hallam, of the Hallam & Swope gallery in Hudson, N.Y. ''What's great about photography is that it's accessible and open to everybody at every price range.''

1998-09-18	Inside Art; The Hermitage Gets Some Help	The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg is so beloved in this country that a group called the American Friends of the Hermitage is presenting the museum's director, Mikhail B. Piotrovsky, with a $100,000 gift when he comes to New York next week for the opening of ''Master Drawings From the Hermitage and Pushkin Museums,'' at the Morgan Library. The gift will go toward the formation of a new decorative arts department at the Hermitage, the first new department to be established there since 1852. In it the Hermitage plans to display its extraordinary collection of furniture, porcelains, costumes and other decorative artifacts, which have been languishing in storage for lack of exhibition space.

The show, ''Wrapped in Pride: Ghanaian Kente and African-American Identity,'' has 185 traditional and modern examples dating back to 1720. It continues through Jan. 3 and will then go to Los Angeles, Detroit and Washington. Imported Talent The financially troubled Royal Opera House in London tapped the executive ranks of American Ballet Theater yesterday in appointing an executive director. He is Michael M. Kaiser, executive director of Ballet Theater for three years. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of the Royal Opera House, said that Mr. Kaiser would begin on Nov. 12. Last week Sir Colin announced the cancellation of all Royal Opera and most Royal Ballet performances until December 1999 to enable the house to put its affairs in order. Sir Colin noted that Mr. Kaiser had eliminated deficits, increased revenue and expanded education and outreach programs. Golden Age Fifty posters for films produced or distributed by Ufa, the legendary German film studio that reached its apogee in the 1920's and gave the world stars like Marlene Dietrich, Pola Negri and Emil Jannings and directors like Fritz Lang, Ernst Lubitsch and F. W. Murnau, go on display today through Jan. 5 at the Museum of Modern Art. In conjunction with the exhibition, ''Ufa Film Posters, 1918-1943,'' the museum will present an eight-film series, ''From the Archives: Some Ufa Classics,'' through Sept. 29. The exhibition is the first to show posters from all of Fritz Lang's Ufa films, including ''Dr. Mabuse'' (1922) and ''Metropolis'' (1927). Going, Going Remember that Union Jack minidress Geri Halliwell wore at the height of her fame (1997) as Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls?

On Tuesday a notebook containing Paul McCartney's handwritten lyrics for the Beatles hit ''Hey Jude'' was bought for $167,000 by Alan Murphy, a Lancashire businessman. The sale benefits a children's cancer charity. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER
1998-09-15	Magazine Set To Auction Art Collection	The financially troubled Reader's Digest Association, owner of an exceptional art collection, will be selling an estimated $100 million of Impressionist and 20th-century works by masters like Cezanne, Monet, Modigliani and Matisse at public auction in New York in November, several experts close to the negotiations said yesterday. While both Sotheby's and Reader's Digest refused to comment, art experts said that the York Avenue auction house had been chosen to sell the works in a special evening sale during the height of the fall art season. The auction is a big coup for Sotheby's, which competed fiercely for it against its archrival, Christie's. But the choice, experts said, was an obvious one, since Sotheby's has been working with Reader's Digest for years, doing its appraisals and last May selling two paintings -- a Monet and a van Gogh -- which totaled $6.2 million. Around the same time, Reader's Digest also sold a Braque still life privately.
1998-09-13	A Cubist Vision of Theater as Sculpture in Motion	FROM Dali to David Hockney, Picasso to Howard Hodgkin, numerous artists this century have designed for the live arts, devising sets or costumes -- and sometimes both -- for theater, opera and ballet productions on both sides of the Atlantic. But even with that distinguished lineup, there's something startling about the dance and opera designs of Fernand Leger (1881-1955), the French cubist whose creative contribution to the performing arts in Paris on and off over some 30 years proceeded in tandem with the abstract geometric canvases for which he remains best known. On Oct. 21, the results of this fusion of theater and art go on sale, with the auction at Sotheby's in London of 70 watercolors and drawings of the artist's ballet and opera designs. The collection is that of the fashion designer Pierre Cardin, who bought the works from Leger's widow, Nadia, and displayed them in the opening exhibition of his Espace Cardin in Paris in 1970. Its total value has been set at about $650,000, a conservative estimate because, as Oliver Barker, the sale's coordinator, put it, ''In terms of Sotheby's and theater, this is really a first.''
1998-07-24	Inside Art; Selling Icons Of Modern Art	While much of the art world slows down in the summer, for auction house experts it's one of the busiest times of the year. July and August are when they travel the world, trying to get property to sell for the big auctions in November. And when a house obtains an important collection to sell, it is generally announced as soon as possible to encourage other sellers to follow. This week, Sotheby's got the goods. It will be selling seven works with an estimated value of $13.5 million that belong to the Boston collectors Mildred and Herbert Lee.
1998-07-21	Sotheby's, Expanding, Plans a Showplace	An ambitious plan to expand Sotheby's headquarters on York Avenue and 72d Street into a department store for art with a sleek glass and granite facade and a sculpture garden on its roof has reached a critical stage in the city's approval process. The plan, which is expected to cost more than $100 million, will be reviewed and given a public hearing tomorrow by the New York City Planning Commission. It is expected to receive strong support.
1998-07-17	Inside Art; Settlement Paid In Paintings	When a $5 million pledge to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago from its chairman went unpaid, the institution took action. An out-of-court settlement was reached last week, but the museum got two paintings instead of cash.
1998-07-06	A Record $33 Million for a Monet	On July 28, 1954, an English collector wandered into a London art gallery and spent about $7,000 for a colorful Monet. The painting, ''Waterlily Pond and Path by the Water,'' was one of six the artist had made of his water garden in Giverny in 1900. Until it was offered for sale at Sotheby's here last week, it had been hanging in that same collector's house for the last 44 years. On Tuesday night, in a hushed salesroom, five telephone bidders battled for the painting; it ended up breaking previous records for the artist anywhere, selling for a staggering $33 million, more than three times its estimate. Officials at Sotheby's refused to give either the buyer's name or his nationality. All they would say was that he wished to remain anonymous.
1998-06-19	Painting a Dark Time in the Colors of Hope	THERE is a watercolor, painted with her happy blues and reds and a touch of leaf green (in her work, one often finds leaf green), that the artist Nelly S. Toll made as an 8-year-old child in wartime Poland. It depicts a little girl with a red ribbon in her hair brushing her big, docile shepherd dog in a large wash basin, while her mother prepares food in their enormous kitchen. ''Dog Is My Friend'' is the name of the story Ms. Toll wrote to accompany the painting.

Yet nine letters have surfaced written in 1945 and 1946 by Einstein, the physicist who formulated the theory of relativity, to Margarita Konenkova. According to a book by a former Soviet spy master, Mrs. Konenkova was a Russian agent whose mission was to introduce Einstein to the Soviet vice consul in New York.

In their glory years, Iznik faience wares were as popular as Dutch Delft tiles, at least among the Ottoman sultans and princes. Tourists who visit Istanbul today are dazzled by the beauty of the 400-year-old Iznik tiles that line the walls of the sultan's private apartments, the harem and the library of Topkapi Palace and various mosques. These colorful, lustrous tiles are among the greatest achievements in faience of any culture.

Sotheby's has now dropped its London antiquities auctions, so it has added two additional categories, Western Asiatic Antiquities and Islamic Works of Art, to its June 4 antiquities sale in Manhattan. The Christie's sale, on June 5, includes all ancient art, starting with neolithic sculpture of the fifth millennium B.C. Both sales are large, and the works of art are well described.
1998-05-15	After the Homer: Works at a Price	News that William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, paid more than $30 million for a major seascape by Winslow Homer last week has set off debate among American art collectors and dealers over whether the already heated market for American paintings will rise even more -- perhaps another 25 percent -- at the important auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's next week. Not only was the price a record for an American painting, but it also catapulted American fine art into the same financial stratosphere as European paintings. ''It's going to have an impact, but it's not something you can quantify in percentages,'' said Dara Mitchell, director of American paintings at Sotheby's. ''We're in the midst of an expanding market, and the sale of the Homer will certainly raise people's awareness of American paintings.'' Not just major American masters like Homer are getting attention. Even at small sales, the work of second-tier American artists are achieving what seem to be unbelievably high prices.
1998-05-15	$17.3 Million 'Marilyn' Sets Record for Warhol	''Orange Marilyn,'' Andy Warhol's iconic 1964 image of Marilyn Monroe, broke all records for the artist and became the highest-priced painting of the spring auction season last night when it was sold at Sotheby's for $17.3 million, more than four times the previous record for a Warhol. Two unidentified telephone bidders fought a tense battle, and when it ended, the packed salesroom burst into thunderous applause. The price set the tone for the evening. The sale totaled $35.6 million, far above Sotheby's high estimate of $25.5 million. Of the 56 works offered, 45 found buyers.
1998-05-14	A $12 Million Monet Leads a Solid, if Stodgy, Sale	Despite the taxi strike, collectors, dealers and art lovers came in droves to Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art last night. But getting there seemed to be more of an adventure than the sale itself. Although strong prices were achieved -- and at times several bidders fought for works of art -- the evening seemed painfully dull. The sale totaled $77.9 million, above Sotheby's low estimate of $74.7 million but far below the $102 million high estimate. Of the 57 works offered, 43 found buyers.

''All we want now is a cozy little bungalow.'' Fourteen years ago, she and her husband, Fred, were shown the apartment in which they now live and were astonished by what they saw. There, in the ground-floor flat of an unassuming Victorian house in Southport, a seaside town in the north of England, was Edwardian splendor: paneling of satin veneer in the living room, dining room and entrance hall, all ornamented with gold in the Louis XVI style. ''We couldn't believe our eyes,'' Mrs. Norton said. They bought the apartment and moved in.
1998-04-30	Art Sales: Dazzling Brochures, Dim Hopes	With the first major fine art auctions of the year scheduled to begin next week at Christie's and Sotheby's in Manhattan, it's not the art people are talking about, but the catalogues. They are being criticized as overdesigned, gimmicky and hard to read; some even have poor color reproductions. In what promises to be one of the dullest spring seasons in years, it seems that both auction houses are trying to disguise their slim offerings. The brochures, with their glut of gate-fold photographs and fancy typefaces, are ''an attempt to make lesser things look more important and more like museum catalogues,'' said Susan Seidel, a private Manhattan dealer. ''But they're totally unreadable.''

Now its collection includes about 16,000 pieces, ranging from pre-Columbian to contemporary art. Many of the works hang in some 350 Chase offices around the world.

When the King revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the law that granted religious liberty to the Huguenot Protestants, thousands of Huguenots fled France, taking their considerable skills with them. Paul Revere, for example, was a descendant of Huguenots. One of the French emigres settled briefly in the Netherlands, then moved to London in 1691 with his wife and 3-year-old son. When the son, Paul de Lamerie, turned 15, he was apprenticed to Pierre Platel, a highly skilled first-generation Huguenot goldsmith in London. The teen-ager thrived.

A little over a year ago, for example, Christie's signed a lease for space in Rockefeller Center, and the auction house plans to move there from its Park Avenue and 59th Street headquarters next year. But well before Christie's moves in, there will be an outdoor sculpture exhibition. In June, the Center's Channel Gardens, which lead from Fifth Avenue to Rockefeller Center's famous ice skating rink, will be the site of ''Rodin at Rockefeller Center,'' an exhibition of eight Rodin sculptures collected by Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, Manhattan philanthropists who amassed the largest private collection of Rodin sculptures in the world.

But whatever the reason, after a blockbuster fall when the estates of big-name collectors like Victor and Sally Ganz and Evelyn Sharp were sold at auction, no equally important collectors have either died or decided to sell their works over the last six months, leaving auction house experts scrambling for property to sell. Sotheby's, though, has been able to snag one reasonably important group of paintings: 10 works valued at $10 million that belong to Rolf and Margit Weinberg, collectors from Zurich who plan to sell a selection of their paintings at Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters on May 13.

Busy with the preparations for Inauguration Day, Mrs. Kennedy wrote to Marita O'Connor at Bergdorf's Custom Hat Department to ask for help in choosing the accessories for her White House ensembles. In the letter, the First Lady asks, ''Could I use you as my personal shopper there?'' Betty Halbreich, a personal shopper at Bergdorf Goodman since the 1970's, said that while women have long had relationships with special salespeople at department stores, ''I think the term was Jackie's conception.''
1998-03-01	Sold! To the Buyer With the Eclectic Taste	More than 1,000 buyers from 50 countries purchased pieces of one of the most celebrated love story of the 20th century, that of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, during a nine-day sale at Sotheby's that ended Friday.
1998-02-26	Art for a Duchess	So who was the artist identified as ''***Costantino'' in the three-volume catalogue of items from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor auction? He or she did two still lifes that were sold last night at Sotheby's. ''They seemed to think this was some mysterious Italian, and instead it's I,'' said HELEN COSTANTINO FIORATTI, an interior designer and art and antiques dealer on the East Side.
1998-02-22	$415,000 for the Desk Where a King Quit	The George III mahogany library table at which King Edward VIII signed his abdication in 1936 was sold yesterday at Sotheby's for $415,000 to an unidentified telephone bidder. ''For a real piece of history, it didn't go very high,'' said Steven Klar, a Manhattan collector who was sitting in the third row of the salesroom, paddle poised to bid on a portrait of Queen Mary after the desk was sold. ''Just think: the nuclear test ban treaty desk went for over $1 million. This is no Jackie.''
1998-02-20	Piece by Piece, Windsor Legacy Disperses	They came from Paris and San Francisco, Omaha and Australia to watch the final chapter of the 20th century's most celebrated love story -- that of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor -- begin to unfold last night in the first of nine days of sales at Sotheby's. Some came for purely sentimental reasons, others with commercial aspirations. And curiosity was a big draw, as it is at any celebrity auction. ''I'm an Anglophile,'' said Mamie McIndoe, a Manhattan collector. ''And this is an important a piece of history. Who's seen the inside of a royal home?''
1998-02-16	The Stuff of Legend	A circle closes with the auction at Sotheby's this week of some 40,000 possessions of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. These objects are now owned by Mohamed al-Fayed, who bought the contents of the Windsors' Paris residence a decade ago, shortly after the Duchess of Windsor's death in 1986. (The Duke expired in 1972.) The proceeds of this sale will be donated to children's charities that were supported by Mr. al-Fayed's son, Dodi, and the woman who was killed with him in Paris last August, Princess Diana. It all seems oddly fitting somehow. Diana had begun to discover the meaning of royal exile, a subject on which the Duke of Windsor, and perhaps especially his Duchess, who was denied the status of Royal Highness, might have had a lot to say. The Duke of Windsor was ''the perfect Prince of Wales,'' Janet Flanner wrote long ago, and Diana was a perfect Princess, demonstrating only how unmeaning the word ''perfect'' really is when applied to actual existence.
1998-02-15	Inside Windsor Closets	IT was a chance to peek at the personal effects of those two lovers in the ultimate valentine story -- the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Who could resist, especially since Sotheby's had meticulously arranged the goods in settings designed to emulate the couple's Paris villa, now owned by Mohamed al-Fayed? On Monday night, the auction house held a private preview of property from the Windsor collection -- more than 40,000 objects, from their bed to their buttons -- which will be sold starting Thursday.
1998-02-15	For Love, He Gave Up a Crown (but Not His Books)	Throughout his life, the Duke of Windsor lived surrounded by books. There were Bibles and prayer books that were given to him in childhood by his mother and his grandmother and 20th-century history books inscribed and sent to him by the world leaders who had written them. There were numerous books on his world travels, British royalty, golf, fox hunting, military history, cooking, wines, fashion, art, literature and pugs. Books were part of the trappings of privilege, and the Duke continued to accumulate them. He carted them with him whenever he changed residences, from palace to palace, first as Prince Edward of York, then as Edward of Wales and, finally, as King Edward VIII. After he abdicated in 1936 and became the Duke of Windsor, he married Wallis Warfield Simpson, and the couple -- and his books -- moved to Paris. There they eventually settled near the Bois de Boulogne in a Louis XVI-style mansion, which the couple leased from the City of Paris.
1998-02-13	Christie's Tests Museum Style	Auction houses have been trampling on the turf of dealers for some time now, what with Sotheby's and Christie's buying up art galleries and increasing their private treaty sales (selling art, that is, without putting it on the block). At the same time, the houses have been tiptoeing on museum and publishing territory, mounting museum-style exhibitions and producing lavish books, besides the standard catalogues.
1998-02-13	A Passion For Linen (And Initials)	Once upon a time, trousseaus were lovingly amassed in anticipation of the day when a young woman would meet Mr. Right. And when she did, the sheets, towels and napkins were destined to be used over and again for the rest of her life and then passed from generation to generation. The Baltimore belle born Bessie Wallis Warfield had three opportunities to build a trousseau, but she only hit her stride after her third and final marriage. Alas, she died without heirs, so the contents of her linen closet are now available to anyone with the funds -- and the patience -- to sit through the nine-day public dispersal of her worldly goods. What is arguably the largest collection of household linen ever to hit the auction block is part of the coming sale of the belongings of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at Sotheby's New York. The auction, which begins on Thursday and runs through Feb. 27, features more than 40,000 items, from trivial (Bakelite telephones, stuffed animals) to treasures (18th-century French antiques, a portrait of Queen Mary, the Duke's mother). Startlingly, 2,108 of those items are napkins, tablecloths, coverlets, sheets, pillow cases and the like.
1998-02-12	Design Notebook; The Windsor Hoopla: Reading the Poignant Subtext	AUCTIONS are about shopping. But increasingly, they are becoming a chance to reflect on the ultimate futility of acquisition. Consider Sotheby's dispersal of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's household chattel, from the formula for her L'Oreal hair dye to his painted taffeta heraldic banner to their 1940's neo-traditional furniture by Jansen, the eminent Parisian design house. These and more than 40,000 other Windsor relics will be disposed of in a nine-day sale that begins Tuesday at Sotheby's.
1998-02-06	Fashion Plate With World As Audience	Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, was on the 10 Best Dressed List for decades, but today many are more interested in the Duke of Windsor's contribution to the ''Windsor Style.'' Eleanor Lambert, the fashion publicity agent who created the list in 1940, recalled the years when she was friendly with the Duke and Duchess. ''The Duchess was a haute couture mannequin,'' she said. ''His Royal Highness was a dream of fashion. He invented fashion trends.''
1998-02-05	Sotheby's Decorates for the Windsors	SOTHEBY'S NEW YORK is playing house. For a preview exhibition for the nine-day sale of the collection of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, which begins Feb. 19, Sotheby's has created seven decorated room settings, closely modeled on the salon, dining room, library, bedroom suites and entrance hall of the Windsors' Louis XVI-style residence in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. The rooms will open to the public on Tuesday and remain on view through the sale. The rooms provide an unusually personal context for the more than 3,000 lots -- which include furniture, accessories, art and clothing.
1998-01-30	Perhaps Shot, Perhaps Not	As familiar as Andy Warhol's image of Marilyn Monroe has become in the visual vocabulary of popular culture, the actual paintings the artist executed in the early 1960's rarely appear on the market. When they do, they generate a good deal of excitement among Pop Art collectors, which is the case with ''Orange Marilyn.'' ''Orange Marilyn,'' which will be sold at Sotheby's in New York on May 14, is from the famous Stroher collection, a German collection of 20th-century art that was one of the first in Europe to include American Pop Art.
1998-01-29	$7 Million Michelangelo	One of the last Michelangelo drawings still in private hands was sold at Sotheby's in New York yesterday to an unidentified telephone bidder for $7.4 million, a record price for a drawing by the artist. ''Christ and the Woman of Samaria,'' a black chalk study of two figures dating from the early 1550's, was sold by the Martin Bodmer Foundation in Geneva to establish an acquisitions fund.

Those are among the celebrities that United States military personnel in Bosnia said they would most like to chat with. The list was compiled by Johnny Grant, the honorary mayor of Hollywood, during a visit to the troops. Other favorites included the actors Harrison Ford, Will Smith, Jack Nicholson and Halle Berry and the music world's Garth Brooks, Toni Braxton, Patti LaBelle and Barry Manilow. Brush With Fame Most recall him as statesman, orator, author. But when time permitted, Winston Churchill painted. On Monday, the largest exhibition of art by Britain's World War II leader is to go on display at Sotheby's in London. The two-week show will include more than 100 works done between 1915 and Churchill's death in 1965. The show coincides with the 50th anniversary of both Churchill's election by the Royal Academy as Honorary Academician Extraordinary and the publication in book form of his essay ''Painting as a Pastime.'' In it, he wrote: ''Painting is a friend who makes no undue demands, excites no exhausting pursuits, keeps faithful pace even with feeble steps and holds her canvas as a screen between us, the envious eyes of Time or the sultry advances of Decrepitude.'' Recently a 1927 Churchill landscape sold for $250,000. Homebound Age and infirmity will prevent the actress Deborah Kerr and the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke from journeying to London to accept the honors conferred on them in the first New Year's Honors List of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Miss Kerr, 76, who starred in the 1956 film ''The King and I,'' said from her home in Switzerland that she was too frail to fly to England to receive her Order of the British Empire. And Mr. Clarke, 80, who is to be named a knight, said from his home in Sri Lanka that he was in a wheelchair and could not attend. Northern Lights After selling 250 million albums, the members of Abba went their various ways. But the Nordic countries, particularly Sweden, continue to produce popular music. Groups like Ace of Base and Roxette have a following in the United States and the heavy-metal slammers Clawfinger are popular in Britain. Export Music Sweden, an organization in Stockholm that notes that Swedish artists must export their music to succeed, says that the 1995 export value of Swedish bands was $194 million, equal to the value of export sales of Swedish arms. The group said that it didn't hurt that Nordic entertainers, like Iceland's Bjork, can tailor their work to English-speaking audiences. Words of Wisdom Please, no more yada, yada, yada. Forget about: Show me the money. Stop talking about athletes who give 110 percent. If you're discussing gambling, don't call it gaming. These suggestions for ridding the 1998 vocabulary of cliches, euphemisms and slang come from the publicity department of Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste.

1997-12-17	Sotheby's to Tighten Procedures Regarding History and Sale of Art	While denying that it had knowingly auctioned smuggled art works, Sotheby's said yesterday that it would tighten its procedures in response to accusations of widespread improprieties involving the sale of illegally exported paintings and looted antiquities. The changes were announced after a 10-month, $11 million internal investigation stemming from the publication of a book, ''Sotheby's: The Inside Story,'' by Peter Watson, and an accompanying television series. Mr. Watson wrote that illegally exported and smuggled works were being auctioned and implied the practice was widespread.
1997-12-11	In Continuing Auction Frenzy, Bernstein Scores	Arlette Snyder grabbed her husband's wrist, preventing him from raising his blue bidder's paddle yet again and trying to top his rival in the bidding for Leonard Bernstein's piano last night. This was the instrument Bernstein called his B-52, the big Bosendorfer with the extra bass keys that could rattle the windows, the shiny grand at which Bernstein composed his opera ''A Quiet Place.'' So the first night of an auction of Bernstein memorabilia at Sotheby's ended with the 7-foot-4-inch Bosendorfer going to the other bidder, a physician who had placed his $350,000 bid by telephone and refused to let the auction house identify him.

1997-12-08	This Week	EVENTS Vintage Sondheim LONDON -- Preview performances of the world premiere of a Stephen Sondheim musical begin on Thursday night, and thereby hangs a tale. This show makes its debut not on Broadway but at the Bridewell Theater just off Fleet Street in London, in what used to be a swimming pool. Mr. Sondheim wrote this show, ''Saturday Night, '' in 1955, but when its producer died, plans for performances were halted; Mr. Sondheim became involved in ''West Side Story,'' and the rest is show-business history. But a couple of years ago, when Mr. Sondheim attended a Bridewell workshop on musical theater and heard a couple of ''Saturday Night'' songs, he began to think about letting the old show be produced. The plot deals with a group of sharp Brooklyn boys trying desperately to get dates for Saturday night. Directed by Carol Metcalfe and Clive Paget, the production at the Bridewell, which has a reputation for high-quality, low-budget musicals, opens officially on Dec. 17 and runs through Jan. 24.

A former Jewish law student in Vienna who survived Hitler's Germany by assuming an Aryan identity and marrying a Nazi, Ms. Hahn had a new wonder to ponder yesterday. A collection of personal papers documenting her astonishing wartime escapes and loves sold at auction in London for $169,250, almost five times the top estimate by Sotheby's. The Edith Hahn Archive, as the hundreds of pages of intimate letters, Nazi documents and photographs are called, was purchased by two wealthy Philadelphia businessmen: Drew Lewis, Transportation Secretary in the Reagan Administration and a retired corporate executive, and Dalck Feith, an entrepreneur in steel and a survivor himself.

Whether it's Russian literature, poetry, ballet, art or pre-Revolutionary dynastic tragedy, Americans can't seem to get enough of the Romanovs. When the Faberge exhibition came to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996, it broke all attendance records for a decorative arts show. This year we have ''Anastasia,'' an animated movie. We have the Romanovs at galleries, in museums, on the auction block and, of all places, at the New York Public Library. After only three weeks, the catalogues have run out for the library's new exhibition ''The Romanovs: Their Empire, Their Books.'' Not that they are ordinary books. They were intended to delight the Czar and his family. The private Romanov libraries held luxurious coronation albums, imperial menus, presentation copies of regimental histories with the ribbon of the Order of St. George in the binding, a provincial town record book with a cover decorated in gold and silver threads. There's even a purple tome commemorating the assassination of Alexander II.

A suite of rooms on the Vanderbilt Avenue side of the building that was decorated like a Florentine palazzo and for years was hidden behind the Sheetrock and fluorescent fixtures of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority offices, is slowly emerging from the dust. By next year, it will be an elegant lounge serving casual food. The Campbell Apartment, as it is known, was an empty 1,300-square-foot space in the terminal until 1923, when John W. Campbell, who was the chairman of the Credit Clearing House (taken over by Dun & Bradstreet), rented it as an office and for social functions. He had the 25-foot ceiling richly carved and painted in Renaissance style, added a carved balcony and leaded glass windows, installed a tiled bath and shower, a marble fireplace, a wine cellar and even a pipe organ.

The auction house had estimated it would bring more than $25 million. The five principal works, which Sotheby's had reckoned would bring in $15 million alone, failed to make their reserve prices. Of the 124 artworks originally offered, only 88 found buyers; 35 were withdrawn because of inadequate bids, and 1 was taken out of the auction before bidding for it began.

The tribute, to be held on May 4, honors distinguished film artists for their contribution to the medium. Mr. Scorsese, a native New Yorker and graduate of the New York University Film School, is the director of such films as ''Mean Streets,'' ''Taxi Driver,'' ''New York, New York,'' ''Raging Bull,'' ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' ''Goodfellas'' and ''Casino.''

1997-11-14	A Renoir Leads a Conservative Night at Auction	Welcome to the age of auction realism. With the exception of once-in-a-lifetime sales like Monday night's auction at Christie's of contemporary and modern art from the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz, when buyers were willing to pay big prices for art that just wouldn't be available again, buyers for the most part are far more careful at auctions these days. It's cool to pay as little as possible; paying too much, as buyers did in the late 1980's, is definitely not the thing to do. Last night's sale of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's was a perfect example. To be sure, several of the best works went for high prices, but much of the art on offer sold far below estimate. Paintings and sculptures that had been on the market too recently, were too highly estimated or simply were not good quality died on the podium.

Its sale of modern art from the the estate of the hotelier Evelyn Sharp was too highly estimated. To make matters worse, Sotheby's had given the heirs a guarantee -- an undisclosed sum of money, generally hovering around the low estimate, to be paid to the seller regardless of the sale's outcome. And therefore Sotheby's ended the evening at a loss. Of the 39 works, all but five sold, but many went for far less than their estimates. The sale totaled $41.2 million, well below its estimate of $59 million to $78 million.
1997-11-09	Cashing In on Art: All in the Timing	THE SAVVIEST COLLECTORS ARE CANNY about finding the finest art, getting it exhibited prominently in museums and then knowing just when to donate or sell it. Until recently, this approach was usually reserved for owners of master paintings and furnishings with impressive pedigrees. Now even the owners of esoteric art are taking this route, as can be seen in the highly publicized sale of medieval enamels taking place at Sotheby's in New York on Nov. 20. Sotheby's describes the works, part of what is known as the Keir Collection, as ''the most remarkable collection of medieval enamels in private hands.'' The sale, of 180 objects, is expected to total $25 million, the highest presale estimate for an auction of medieval art. Sotheby's is promoting the sale with a lavishly illustrated catalogue and invitation-only previews, with champagne, in six cities, from Paris to Los Angeles.

The auction was postponed in September by Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of the collection, after his son Dodi and Diana, the Princess of Wales, were killed in a car crash in Paris. The nine-day auction of approximately 3,200 lots will be preceded by a public exhibition from Feb. 10 to 18. Mr. al-Fayed is the owner of the contents of the Duke and Duchess's Paris home. Sotheby's said the entire net proceeds of the sale, which were to have gone to the Al Fayed International Charitable Foundation, will now go to a foundation which is in the process of being established. To be called the Dodi Fayed International Charitable Foundation, its main purpose will be to provide money for causes that were supported by the Princess and Dodi Fayed, chiefly those devoted to suffering children.

The print was originally bought by an art teacher in 1969 for $250.

1997-10-20	Museums Finding Money In Aristocratic Rooms	Three prominent American museums sold antique doorways, fireplaces, paneling and lots of furniture from old English houses, most of it unseen by the public for decades, at Sotheby's Manhattan auction room on Saturday. The sale left the museums -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Denver Art Museum -- some $460,000 better off. But the sale also illustrated a trend. The trend that these sales illustrated, not yet universal among American museums, is toward a diminishing enthusiasm for creating and maintaining period rooms. By bringing over from Europe the actual drawing rooms and dining rooms, museums show visitors how, say, English or French aristocrats lived in the 18th century.

The work was one of the last in private hands that dates from the artist's experimental period, which art historians say lasted from 1913 to 1917. The painting came from Stephen Hahn, a retired art dealer and collector who had consigned it to William Acquavella, another Manhattan dealer. Mr. Acquavella had the painting in his Upper East Side gallery for about a year with an asking price of about $20 million.
1997-10-05	Tyrannosaur Skeleton Is Sold To a Museum for $8.36 Million	Sue, the most complete fossil of a Tyrannosaurus rex ever found, was auctioned yesterday for a staggering $8.36 million to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The auction, at Sotheby's in New York City, which involved nine bidders, took only nine minutes to achieve a price believed to be far higher than any ever paid for a fossil.
1997-10-04	Bones to the Highest Bidder	Today's auction at Sotheby's of a near-perfect fossil of a tyrannosaur named Sue was bound to happen now that dinosaurs have become objects of consuming popular interest. Markets come into being for things that people want, and the market for dinosaur bones is no exception. But this sale raises some troubling issues for the future of fossil hunting and of scientific research. Commercialization of fossil hunting can be useful to the extent that it encourages the detection and preservation of specimens that would otherwise go uncollected. But there is a real danger that specimens will be damaged or destroyed as eager but careless fossil hunters get into the digging game, lured by the possibility of finding fossils worth millions. If such fossils are then sold into private collections, scientists will have a harder time getting access to rare specimens.
1997-10-03	The Selling of T. Sue; Tyrannosaur Skeleton May Bring $1 Million, But It's Already Brought Plenty of Trouble	Great issues (and probably upward of $1 million) will hang in the balance tomorrow when a tyrannosaur named Sue, believed to be the most costly fossil ever to reach the open market, will fall under the auctioneer's hammer at Sotheby's. Onlookers at the New York City auction house are expected to include Federal agents, museum curators, Indian tribal leaders, paleontologists, university representatives, commercial fossil dealers, academic paleontologists and people with no special qualifications apart from a fascination with dinosaurs.
1997-10-03	Inside Art; Sotheby's Loses Albers Estate	When Sotheby's bought the Andre Emmerich Gallery in Manhattan last year, officials there said one reason was that it gave them a vehicle for handling artists' estates. But what Sotheby's didn't realize was that not every estate wants to be represented by an auction house. This week, the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the artists' estates, announced that it was not renewing its three-year Emmerich contract, which ended on Tuesday. Instead, the foundation has chosen Leslie Waddington, the London dealer, to handle works it wants to sell.
1997-09-26	Inside Art	2 Quit Sotheby's For a Venture Simon de Pury, Sotheby's trilingual auctioneer and its chairman in Europe, resigned this week. So did Daniella Luxembourg, deputy chairman of Sotheby's Switzerland, who opened Sotheby's offices in Tel Aviv in 1984. The two plan to form a company that will buy and sell works of art for a group of unidentified collectors. The new venture will function as an art fund, too, investing in art on a long-term basis. The company, to be named de P. L., will be based in Geneva but will eventually have offices in New York as well, Mr. de Pury said. The news surprised many in the auction business. Mr. de Pury became a highly visible figure in the American art world after John Marion, Sotheby's chief auctioneer, retired in 1994, and Mr. de Pury began flying to New York from Geneva to conduct Sotheby's most important fine art auctions here. He has gained a reputation as a dynamic auctioneer and one of the company's best business getters.
1997-09-19	Inside Art	Auction Houses Courting Youth Just as museums are trying to appeal to younger audiences, so too are major auction houses. In years past, officials at Sotheby's and Christie's said, they had not generated enough business from the young, contemporary collector who bought brash, avant-garde art. Now these auction houses are addressing the problem, each in its own way. Christie's is rethinking its approach to selling and marketing contemporary art. Starting next year, it will segregate art made between 1970 and the present into a department separate from the one that handles modern masters like Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning and Robert Rauschenberg. The new department will hold sales of art made only within the last 30 years.
1997-09-18	Footlights	NEWS No Sale A guitar once owned by the rock legend Jimi Hendrix that had been expected to fetch more than $280,000 failed to find a buyer at a Sotheby's auction yesterday in London. The black Fender Stratocaster, given by Hendrix in 1968 to a fellow rock musician, Al Kooper, was bid up to $160,000 but failed to reach its reserve price, which was not disclosed. In 1990, his guitar from the Woodstock Festival sold for $316,800. Hendrix died in 1970. 'Candle in the Wind'
1997-09-07	Editors' Note	The Style column on page 75 of The Times Magazine today, about British royalty from a dog's point of view, was written to coincide with the Sept. 11 Sotheby's sale of personal articles of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The magazine went to press before the accident that killed Diana, Princess of Wales; the sale was subsequently postponed.
1997-09-03	After Deaths, Delay in Sale Of Windsors' Possessions	Sotheby's announced yesterday that it was postponing its auction of more than 40,000 objects belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor from the couple's famous Paris home. The announcement came as Sotheby's experts were putting the finishing touches on the objects' installation in preparation for the nine-day sale that was to begin at the auction house's York Avenue headquarters on Sept. 11. Sotheby's said the decision had been made in accord with the wishes of Mohamed al-Fayed, owner of the Windsors' villa and its contents, after the death on Sunday of Mr. Fayed's son Emad and Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris. ''As a mark of respect, I believe there should be an appropriate interval before the auction takes place,'' Mr. Fayed said in a statement issued yesterday. No new date has been set, but officials at Sotheby's said they were hoping the sale would occur early next year.
1997-08-28	Off With Their Fish Forks!	It is a strange story, how the contents of the Paris home of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor found their way to Sotheby's auction house in New York. The story leads back to the contentious relationship between Mohamed al-Fayed, the 63-year-old Egyptian multi-millionaire, and the British establishment. A jovial, extroverted and pugnacious businessman, Mr. Fayed secured a long-term lease in 1987 on the former Windsor villa in the Bois de Boulogne and in the ensuing years spent $40 million to repair and restore the building and most of the original furnishings, which were displayed on its two main floors. He promised to preserve the collection for posterity.
1997-08-26	Giving Haute Couture Auction Cachet	Sotheby's is taking a gamble on fashion. The auction house has opened a fashion department to sell not historical costumes or celebrity castoffs but contemporary haute couture. Contemporary as in a 1997 Yves Saint Laurent dress, which will be one of 100 pieces of clothing from the 1930's to the 90's in the ''Paris a la Mode'' sale, to be held on Oct. 29 in New York. The idea of selling modern couture clothing in a venerable auction house whose stock in trade is valuable art and antiques came from Tiffany Dubin, the 31-year-old stepdaughter of A. Alfred Taubman, the chairman of Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
1997-07-25	Inside Art	From Paris in the 60's Sotheby's has announced a coup it hopes will add up to $60 million: on Nov. 12, the auction house will sell 45 paintings and sculptures in Manhattan that belonged to Evelyn Sharp, the New York philanthropist and hotel owner, who died in April at the age of 94. Mrs. Sharp began collecting works by masters of the School of Paris in the 1960's. In 1978, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum exhibited her collection. Among its highlights are Modigliani's ''Reclining Nude With Raised Arms'' (1917-1918), which Sotheby's estimates will sell for more than $10 million; Vlaminck's ''Under the Bridge at Bezons,'' a Fauve river scape painted in 1906, expected to sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million; Matisse's ''Still Life With Three Vases'' (1933), estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million, and a group of six Chagalls.
1997-07-23	Sotheby's Moves Its Antiquities Sales to New York	More than just taxes is moving the art market from London to New York. Issues of patrimony have entered the equation too. Last week, after allegations that it had been selling artifacts smuggled into Britain, Sotheby's announced that it would no longer have its general sales of Greek and Roman antiquities or Indian and Himalayan works of art in London. All property in these fields will be sent to New York instead. Sotheby's officials said exceptions would be made if a special collection came up for sale with an impeccable provenance and the seller agreed.
1997-07-18	Inside Art	New Chief for the Getty Barry Munitz, chancellor of the California State University system, has been named president of the J. Paul Getty Trust, a private foundation devoted to the visual arts and the humanities and the umbrella organization that runs the J. Paul Getty Museum. Dr. Munitz, who will begin the job on Jan. 5, will succeed Harold M. Williams, who has led the Getty since 1981 and who announced his retirement last summer. The Getty Trust, with its $4.3 billion endowment, is the largest and richest arts and humanities organization in the United States. On Dec. 16, it will open its new a $1 billion campus, designed by Richard Meier & Partners, in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. Besides the museum, the trust also includes the Getty Conservation Institute, the Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities, the Education Institute for the Arts, the Information Institute, the Leadership Institute for Museum Management and the Getty Grant Program.
1997-07-13	The Royal Treatment: These Dogs Had Their Day	WHOEVER said that the Duke and Duchess of Windsor had nothing but style should get a load of their pugs. The Windsors' Paris home was full of them, underfoot and in porcelain, silver, needlepoint, lacquer, gouaches and oils. Trooper, Disraeli, Diamond, Impy and Davy Crockett have all gone to doggy heaven, but the pug memorabilia belonging to their masters overruns the catalogue pages for September's auction at Sotheby's New York of the contents of the royal couple's Bois de Boulogne villa.
1997-07-08	Windsors' Legacy On the Block	For more than five years, more than 60 Sotheby's experts from all over the world have been secretly cataloguing the entire contents of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's Paris home in anticipation of what the auction house hopes will be one of the greatest sales in its history. Sotheby's announced yesterday that the final chapter of the most celebrated love story of the 20th century would take place in the form of a series of auctions in Manhattan from Sept. 11 to 19. More than 40,000 objects will be offered: everything from the famous George III mahogany library table at which King Edward VIII signed his abdication in 1936, becoming the Duke of Windsor, to a box containing a piece of the Duke and Duchess's wedding cake. Sotheby's officials said the sale would bring $5 million to $7 million. The proceeds will go to charity.
1997-07-02	Dealers and Auction Houses Are Terrified as Federal Investigators Ask About Their Private Realm	On the heels of one of the most successful auction seasons in years, the rarefied and secretive world of Manhattan art dealers has been shaken by a Federal investigation into possible price fixing. Some of the most prominent dealers, as well as Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's largest auction houses, have been served with subpoenas by the United States Justice Department. As details come to light, what appears to be a wide-ranging antitrust investigation looms larger than dealers first imagined, and some worry that basic ways of doing business are being called into question. While the Justice Department is saying little, dealers and their lawyers have reported that the Federal investigation centers on collusion among art dealers buying at auction. The Government is also looking at the possibility of collusion between Sotheby's and Christie's, historically archrivals, in setting buyer's premiums and seller's commissions.
1997-06-28	At London Art Sales, Americans Look On While Europeans Buy	Despite the large number of American dealers who attended the Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions here, the big buyers at Sotheby's and Christie's this week were primarily European. Almost none of the major American collectors made the trip this season. Even so, $105.8 million worth of art was sold by the two auction houses in their evening sales alone. As they always do, the houses flew their representatives to London from cities like Geneva, Cologne, Vienna and Zurich and they were the busiest buyers, often juggling several telephones at once with bids on behalf of their European clients, most of whom did not attend.
1997-06-27	Sotheby's Buys in Chicago	Seeking to expand its business in the Midwest, Sotheby's has announced that it is buying Leslie Hindman of Chicago, the region's biggest auction house. It did not disclose the price. William Ruprecht, managing director of Sotheby's American operations, estimated on Wednesday that the Chicago house's sales of art and antiques ran from $10 million to $15 million a year and said he expected the business to grow considerably.
1997-06-04	Sotheby's Says It May Build At Its Present East Side Site	Fearing that its move to a new headquarters could be delayed several years if it waits for the New York Coliseum site to be developed, Sotheby's has dusted off a 12-year-old proposal to expand atop its present auction house at York Avenue and 72d Street. Sotheby's made the decision to look homeward as city and Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials were evaluating proposals by five development teams chosen as finalists to rebuild the Coliseum as an anchor for the Columbus Circle area. A winner is expected to be chosen this summer.
1997-06-03	Top Art Dealers Are Subpoenaed In Possible Price-Rigging Scheme	Justice Department investigators have subpoenaed truckloads of financial documents from more than a dozen prominent Manhattan art dealers and from Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's largest auction houses, in what appears to be a wide-ranging antitrust investigation. Dealers, many of whom spoke with anxiety about the Federal investigation yesterday, said they had been served with the subpoenas over the last month.
1997-05-20	A Sale of Pamela Harriman's Style and Taste, and the Result Is a Proper Success	Star-gazers went to Sotheby's last night to see what would happen to Pamela Harriman's artworks and snuffboxes, china and furniture. But they were disappointed. Most of the stars were either carefully concealed in sky boxes above the salesroom, or they had left bids days before the sale or simply shopped at home by telephone. In a full but by no means crowded salesroom, telephone fought telephone for the contents of the homes of Mrs. Harriman, the late ambassador to France, in Paris, Washington and Middleburg, Va. Besides the basic tag-sale fare, there were several middle-range artworks, as well as political memorabilia relating to Mrs. Harriman's onetime father-in-law, Sir Winston S. Churchill, and these were among the most sought-after objects at the sale.
1997-05-16	New Buyers Turn Art Sales Into Expensive Parties	The feel-good factor that economists and real estate brokers keep talking about has infected the market for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art at virtually every price level. For the last two weeks, bidders at the important spring sales at Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan spent staggering sums on everything from ultra-sweet Impressionist paintings to hard-edged modern ones. There were even takers for the tough subjects tackled by avant-garde contemporary artists in the late 1980's and early 90's. One reason the atmosphere at the auctions was so buoyant was that many new collectors showed up at the Sotheby's and Christie's salesrooms. This new breed buys in new ways. Its members are not like the successful businessmen in the 1980's who made conspicuous consumption part of the fun by wanting to be seen. Nor are they like the buyers of the far quieter early 1990's, who simply stayed home and bid by telephone or through a dealer.
1997-05-14	Hot Prices but Cool Bidders for Impressionists at Sotheby's	There's no fooling today's millionaire. When it comes to buying Impressionist and modern art, he's cool and controlled and refuses to be swept away by the excitement of an auction. Yet when the work had the right ingredients at Sotheby's in Manhattan last night, the big spenders didn't hold back. By far the biggest surprise was what became the evening's most expensive work, Klimt's ''Tavern at Litzleberg'' (1915-16), which incited a war between two unidentified telephone bidders who simply would not give up. Sotheby's had estimated that the painting, of a tavern by a lake near Salzburg, Austria, would sell for $5 million to $7 million. One of the tenacious bidders finally bought the painting for $14.7 million, a record for the artist's work.
1997-05-08	Rushing to Auction: The Harriman Haul	ESTATE sales used to be relatively sober affairs. A very important person's old master daubs and Faberge bibelots were knocked down to the highest bidder, while the flotsam -- the mismatched juice glasses, the cereal bowl with the chipped rim -- ended up at a thrift shop or on the curb. Then along came Jackie. Until the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction at Sotheby's last April, no sane auctioneer ever suspected that three worn pillows worth about $50 would bring more than $25,000. Call it ''La Triviata,'' where a chafing dish is accorded all the gravity of a fragment of the True Cross. The latest example of this 1990's phenomenon will be held from May 19 to 21, when Sotheby's New York disposes of more than 1,500 items that belonged to Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman. An English lord's daughter turned mistress to the powerful and then United States Ambassador to France, Mrs. Harriman, who was the third wife and widow of the diplomat W. Averell Harriman, died in Paris on Feb. 5 at 76.
1997-05-07	Grabbing Life and Limb at Contemporary Art Auction	The tough really got going at Sotheby's last night. If an artwork was in the form of a body part or an alien creature or even a pig -- the subjects of difficult works from the late 1980's and early 90's -- there was a passionate group of buyers wanting it. The lean, mean sale of contemporary art that began the spring auction season last night showed how broad the market had become. It also established a place at auction for artists like Kiki Smith and Robert Gober, Matthew Barney and Rachel Whiteread. Although they have all been popular, both at galleries and at auction, most of their work up for sale last night set records.
1997-05-03	Prince vs. Professor in a Legal Battle Over a Painting	When Donald L. Turcotte, a Cornell University geology professor, decided to sell an oil painting that had been in his family 40 years, he never expected to find himself ensnared in a legal battle involving a Polish prince and the Sotheby's auction house that has wended its way into two separate courthouses in New York State. But Emily Jane Goodman, a State Supreme Court Justice in Manhattan, ruled on Thursday that the painting, possibly 400 years old and listed by Sotheby's as ''Portrait of a Lady, Presumably Anne of Bretagne,'' cannot be sold until its rightful owner is established.
1997-05-02	It's Spring Fever: Art Has a Date With Its Lovers	AS the art world prepares for the important spring auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art that begin next week in Manhattan, it is speculating about just how much nerve -- and how many millions -- the serious collectors will muster. Economic indicators like the stock market and real estate sales point to quite a lot. ''When people have money, they're going to spend it,'' said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America. ''We're in that moment of the art cycle. People are hungry to buy things of top quality.''
1997-04-18	Inside Art	A Garden for Beloit College The Lannan Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles, continues to give away its modern and contemporary art to institutions around the country. Recently it donated works to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and the Art Institute of Chicago (which also bought 48 of the foundation's works). Now Beloit College in Beloit, Wis., has received Siah Armajani's ''Poetry Garden,'' which has been in the courtyard of the foundation's Los Angeles offices since it was completed five years ago. The walled garden, whose armchairs and benches were designed by the artist with three-inch-thick slats of Alaskan cedar set in angular white steel frames, will be redesigned and expanded by Mr. Armajani for its new home on the Beloit campus.
1997-04-16	CHRONICLE	ARNOLD SCAASI is used to seeing his fashions on the runway, at gala parties, in magazines. This evening he will watch as 104 of his couture designs are auctioned at Sotheby's to benefit the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which was established in 1993 by Evelyn Lauder. Though he donated most of the coats and dresses himself, eight were given by people like Elizabeth Taylor, Mitzi Gaynor and Gayfryd Steinberg.
1997-03-28	Inside Art	How Moore Saw the World Masters like Daumier and Degas, Cezanne and Millet were some of the English sculptor Henry Moore's favorite artists. Moore, who died in 1986 at the age of 88, admired artists who were especially accomplished draftsmen. ''My father felt you couldn't really be a good artist unless you could draw,'' said Mary Moore, the sculptor's only child.
1997-03-21	Inside Art	A Donor From Television Douglas S. Cramer, the producer of such long-running television hits as ''Love Boat'' and ''Dynasty,'' is also a well-known collector of contemporary art. Not only is Mr. Cramer a founder and board member of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, but he is also head of the paintings and sculpture committee at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, where he is on the board. So word that Mr. Cramer is planning to sell his 400-acre Santa Ynez Valley vineyard and ranch in California drew attention in the art world. The ranch is home to the foundation Mr. Cramer started in 1986 to support museum acquisitions, exhibitions and other projects. Spread over five acres, the Douglas S. Cramer Foundation's quarters also have 14,000 square feet of gallery space, including a sculpture pavilion, that is open to the public by appointment two days a week.
1997-03-12	Sotheby's To Auction Harriman Treasures	The contents of Pamela Harriman's homes in Paris, Georgetown and Middleburg, Va., will be sold at Sotheby's in Manhattan on May 19 and 20, the auction house announced yesterday. The sale will include paintings by such artists as Seurat and Sargent; gilt bronze candlesticks, snuffboxes, porcelains and other decorative objects; English, French and Italian furniture, and memorabilia relating to Winston Churchill, one of Mrs. Harriman's fathers-in-law. Mrs. Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, died of a stroke on Feb. 5 at the age of 76. She left her estate (which is believed to be worth about $10 million) to her only child, Winston S. Churchill, grandson of the British Prime Minister, and his estranged wife, Mary. Officials at Sotheby's would not estimate the worth of any of the artworks or objects.
1997-02-21	Inside Art	Tracing Degas's Taste Most museum and gallery exhibitions focus on what artists created rather than what they collected. Artists' own collections rarely remain intact, and when they can be pieced together, as with ''The Private Collection of Edgar Degas,'' a show that opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in October, it is unusual indeed. This grouping of more than 200 paintings, pastels, watercolors, drawings and prints by 19th-century French artists will give viewers a portrait of Degas's taste, his work process, his pleasures and his circle of friends. Since a majority of the works from Degas's collection were sold at auctions in Paris soon after his death in 1918 and are traceable to museums and private collections, four curators (Gary Tinterow, Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein of the Metropolitan and Ann Dumas, a freelance art historian) were able to assemble many of them. Some works were easy to track down. At the Paris auctions eight decades ago, representatives of the National Gallery in London, the Metropolitan and the Louvre were all on hand to buy parts of Degas's collection. The National Gallery and other British institutions bought a group of French paintings. One painting by El Greco was purchased by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, another by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The Metropolitan acquired two Ingres portraits, and the Louvre bought works by Delacroix and Ingres.
1997-02-16	Christie's Wins by a Hammer	Since the 18th century, Sotheby's and Christie's have been in fierce competition in the art auction market. But for the first time since 1954, Christie's has won out over its larger rival.
1997-02-11	At the Wire, Auction Fans, It's, It's . . . Christie's!	Swords will forever be drawn between Hertz and Avis, between Coke and Pepsi and, in the rarefied world of art, between Sotheby's and Christie's. The rival auction houses have been battling for two centuries to corner as much of the art business as they can. Sotheby's, the bigger of the two, has long come out ahead. But when Sotheby's announced its 1996 sales totals on Thursday, it had lost the lead for the first time since 1954. As both houses raced to expand from their London and New York bases, gentlemanly Christie's, trying harder, perhaps, since Christopher Davidge became chief executive four years ago, had inched ahead.
1997-02-07	Art Smuggling At Sotheby's: Executives Suspended	Sotheby's, the world's oldest and best known auction house, said today that it had suspended senior executives in connection with the smuggling of protected works of art from Italy. The smuggling charge was made in a book, ''Sotheby's: Inside Story,'' written by Peter Watson, an arts reporter. It is being published in serial form in The Times of London, which ran the first installment today.
1997-01-31	At Sotheby's, Old Masters Sell Beyond Estimates	Despite talk about the weakness of the market for Old Master paintings, yesterday's sale at Sotheby's in New York brought hefty prices, often several times their estimates. Among the highlights were eight Dutch paintings being sold by the financier Saul Steinberg, one of the biggest Old Master buyers of the 1980's. There was competitive bidding for all his offerings. Sotheby's estimated that the collection would fetch $7.2 million to $9.6 million; it went for $11 million.
1997-01-31	Inside Art	It's Now a Museum of Art As the Brooklyn Museum celebrates its 175th anniversary and the centennial of its landmark McKim, Mead & White building, it is also trying to sharpen its image. This week it announced it would change its name from the Brooklyn Museum to the Brooklyn Museum of Art. It has also hired Vignelli Associates to design new graphics for its stationery, brochures, gallery guides, banners and floor plans.
1997-01-16	Auction For an Eclectic Collection	PACK-RAT collectors who are space-challenged had a friend in Robert C. Woolley. A bearded bon vivant and Sotheby's auctioneer, and a grand acquisitor himself (right, in a graphite portrait by Michael Leonard in the Moroni style), he once said: ''Don't fret. Just move everything one inch to the left.''
1996-12-11	Port Authority to Sell Part of Its Art Collection	None of the artworks will fetch anywhere near the $15.6 million that Willem de Kooning's 1949 ''Woman'' brought last month. Nor is the collection of paintings, sculptures, prints, etchings, lithographs, tapestries and photographs worth anywhere near the $82.3 million taken in at an auction at Christie's on Nov. 13. Nonetheless, the auction at Dawson's Auctioneers and Appraisers in Morris Plains, N.J., on Feb. 8 and 22 is noteworthy for who the seller is: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
1996-12-08	Ups and Downs? All an Illusion	Things are, indeed, not what they seem. For one thing, you probably thought this was by some contemporary artist caught up in the latest stock-market frenzy. No, it's dated 1937. And you probably thought it was a collage. Wrong again. It's a painting by a master of trompe l'oeil, Otis Kaye. The painting, titled ''D'-JIA-VU'' -- get it? Dow Jones industrials? -- shows the market's ups and downs from 1929, when Kaye lost a bundle, to 1937. On Thursday, just in time for the market's latest wild ride, it sold at Sotheby's for $442,500, a record -- by far -- for his work. Stock-market fever, perhaps?
1996-12-06	Inside Art	$11.1 Million for a Sargent John Singer Sargent's 1908 ''Cashmere,'' an arresting painting of the artist's niece elegantly swathed in a cashmere shawl and shown in seven poses, sold for a staggering $11.1 million yesterday. The buyer was an unidentified telephone bidder at Sotheby's sale of American paintings, drawings and sculpture in Manhattan. The price established a record for the artist, exceeding the $7.6 million record set two years ago when Sargent's ''Spanish Dancer'' (circa 1881) was sold at Sotheby's in New York from the estate of Wendell Cherry, founder of Humana, the health-care corporation based in Louisville, Ky. The $11.1 million sale, far above the painting's $5 million-to-$7 million estimate, equals Sotheby's total sales last month at its evening sale of contemporary art in Manhattan.
1996-12-06	CHRONICLE	JOHN F. KENNEDY JR. is the founder of Reaching Up, so it is no surprise that he is giving a benefit reception tonight at Sotheby's for the organization. Mr. Kennedy established Reaching Up in 1989 with money from his family's Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation and in conjunction with the City University of New York. ''We wanted to create a program to train workers who care for the mentally retarded,'' he said yesterday, adding that since its inception, 1,500 students have graduated from programs run by City University in its various branches.
1996-12-05	Doyle Manuscript Sold For $519,500 at Auction	An autograph manuscript of ''The Sign of Four,'' Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's second Sherlock Holmes story, was sold yesterday at Sotheby's to an anonymous American collector for $519,500, far more than the auction house had estimated. Doyle's handwritten final draft of his short novel, the oldest surviving complete Sherlock Holmes manuscript, was expected to sell for $250,000 to $350,000. (The final price includes the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
1996-12-03	When Sherlock Got His Quirks	It was a late summer evening in 1889 when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sat down to dinner at the Langham Hotel in London with an American publishing agent who had come to commission new works of fiction for Lippincott's monthly magazine. Oscar Wilde was also at the table, and the young writers engaged in mutual flattery. They also discussed such topics as future wars and what Doyle later called ''the cynical maxim that the good fortune of our friends made us discontented.''
1996-11-22	They Studied, They Came, They Bid Feverishly	Collectors arrived prepared for Sotheby's and Christie's important fine art auctions in Manhattan, which ended on Wednesday night. Throughout the sales this week and last, they showed up with their dealers and advisers in tow. And everyone seemed to have done his homework. The high prices and record sales that accumulated during the auctions reflected a new breed of informed buyer. ''It's an intelligent, savvy market,'' said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in America. ''Buyers know what they're doing. They're not speculators and that's healthy.'' Mr. Burge added that this fall's auctions proved that quality works, or those that the market perceives to be extraordinary, are once again strong sellers, often topping prices from the boom years of the late 1980's because, as he said, ''there's tons of money out there.''
1996-11-20	Pop Art Wins Another 15 Minutes	Sotheby's had a 60's moment at its sale of contemporary art last night. Pop Art took a star turn as buyers eagerly fell for hearts and flowers. In a sale that offered relatively little in the way of blockbusters, the results were better than most experts expected. The auction totaled $11.1 million, below its low estimate of $13.8 million. Of the 59 works up for sale, 42 found buyers.
1996-11-20	Protect American Art	To the Editor: Your article about Sotheby's recent major Impressionist and modern painting sale (Arts Pages, Nov. 13) mentions that five major works given or bequeathed to the American people by Henry O. and Louisine Havemeyer and held in their trust at the Shelburne Museum were sold at this auction. Is no one outraged?
1996-11-16	Fetching T. Rex Fossil May Fetch $1 Million Plus, Expert Says	Cut off in the prime of life 65 million years ago, chiseled from a butte in South Dakota in 1990 and seized by the F.B.I. two years later, Sue the Tyrannosaur is headed for the auction block at Sotheby's. She may bring well over $1 million, which would be the highest price ever paid for a fossil. The auction will be held next spring in Manhattan. David Redden, a vice president of Sotheby's, said in an interview that the exact date would depend on how long it took to remove the huge bones from the rock in which most of them are embedded.
1996-11-15	Inside Art	Raising a Museum's Profile While the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is a household name in Europe and in the international art world, a lot of Americans aren't familiar with this repository of decorative arts. When Alan Borg became its director a little more than a year ago, he said one of his first missions would be to heighten the museum's profile. Fortunately for him, five North American institutions are more than happy to help. In fact, for nearly a decade now the Baltimore Museum of Art has been talking to officials at the V. and A. about bringing a selection of its vast collection, which has never left England, to America. ''We always had the notion that the North American audience has no idea of the riches of the V. and A.,'' said Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Baltimore Museum. ''We've long wanted to tell a generic story about the evolution of the museum.''
1996-11-14	Silver Tureen Sets Record	A rare French 18th-century silver tureen with a royal pedigree was auctioned yesterday for $10.3 million at Sotheby's in New York. The price was the highest paid at auction for a work of the French decorative arts and three times the previous record for a silver object. The buyer's name was not disclosed. Kevin Tierney, head of the silver department at Sotheby's, said ''the price confirmed the extraordinary value of an object steeped in history, that survived the melts ordered to pay for the Seven Years' War and the French Revolution.''
1996-11-13	Museum's Fortunes Rise at Auction	What would the Havemeyers have thought? Manet's delicate portrait of Suzette Lemaire, which Henry and Louisine Havemeyer bought around 1900, was sold last night at Sotheby's in Manhattan to Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman of Mirage Resorts, who said he intended to put it on view at Bellagio, his latest casino and resort, now under construction in Las Vegas, Nev. Mr. Wynn paid $2.9 million for the pastel, a record for a Manet drawing at auction. The portrait was one of five works sold by the Shelburne Museum in Vermont, founded by the Havemeyers' daughter in 1947, in its effort to climb out of a financial hole.
1996-11-08	Treasures of the Best Families on the Block	Pedigree will be every bit as intriguing as quality at this fall's sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, which begin next week in Manhattan. Collections assembled by prominent American families like the Havemeyers and Engelhards, who began buying art as early as the turn of the century, have found their way to auction this season. Of the estimated $350 million worth of art that goes on view this weekend, including works by masters like Degas, Monet, Manet and Willem de Kooning, these families' treasures will get international attention. Perhaps the most prestigious is a group of Impressionist pastels and a bronze being sold by the Shelburne Museum in Vermont to ease its financial problems. Four pastels, two by Degas and two by Manet, were bought around 1900 by Henry O. Havemeyer, founder of the American Sugar Refining Company, and his wife, Louisine; a Degas bronze was bought by their daughter, Electra Havemeyer Webb, who founded the museum in 1947. All will be offered at Sotheby's on Tuesday night. They represent a kind of grand old American collecting, from a time when industrialists and their children passionately bought everything from Impressionist paintings and American furniture to patchwork quilts and woodblock prints.
1996-10-27	'After All, Fashion Is Art'	WHILE the big parties of the week were all about fashion, the art world had a quieter (but no less high-powered) gathering on Wednesday at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea. But even there, some fashion people showed up to hobnob in the same space where Calvin Klein will hold his show on Friday. ''After all, fashion is art,'' said Miuccia Prada, the designer, who walked from the cocktail reception to dinner with Sandy Brant, an owner of Interview magazine.
1996-10-25	Inside Art	Need Rm; Never Mind Vu House hunting is never easy in Manhattan, as Sotheby's and Christie's well know. For several years each auction house has considered relocating, but their requirements -- both ample space and a central location -- are not so readily available. First there was the former Alexander's department store at Lexington Avenue and 58th Street. Both auction houses negotiated with Steve Roth, the New Jersey developer whose company, Interstate Properties, holds the controlling interest in Alexander's, but neither could make a deal. (If Sotheby's had moved there from its headquarters at York Avenue and 72d Street, it would have been just two blocks from Christie's, at Park Avenue and 59th Street, creating a convenient neighborhood for clients.)
1996-10-24	Going, Going, Gone: Where's The Baby?	WHEN the Bauhaus and avant-garde furniture cache assembled over the last 30 years by Torsten Brohan, a German businessman, goes on the block at Sotheby's in London on Nov. 1, even modernists who think they have seen it all will probably be surprised. Among the most curious of the 300-odd pieces are two rare examples of modernist children's furniture. Lot 108 is a red-painted beech armchair (above), made in 1928 by Erich Dieckmann and estimated at $2,250 to $3,000. Lot 161 is a multicolored highchair (right), made in 1938 from a 1921 design by Gerrit Rietveld, estimated at $18,000 to $27,000.
1996-10-20	Unraveling the Regal Pedigree of a Silver Tureen	WHEN George Ortiz decided in June to sell a sumptuous 18th-century French silver tureen that had been in his family for more than 40 years, he thought he knew almost everything about the piece and its royal pedigree. But after weeks of the kind of detective work that excites collectors, he learned that while a king had indeed owned the tureen, its origins were less than royal. The tureen is a rococo tour de force of silver craftsmanship. The lid looks like an Old Master painting of the makings of a meal: vegetables, shellfish and a sharp-beaked bird. The handles are shaped like a boar's head; the feet resemble those of wild hogs. Even the platterlike stand adds to the fantasy, its surface hammered and chased to look like a shimmering pool.
1996-07-12	Britain to Retain Reliquary Casket Dating to 1195	After a week of public outcry that an 800-year-old reliquary casket commemorating the martyrdom and burial of St. Thomas a Becket had been lost to England, the casket's owner agreed yesterday to let the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Victoria and Albert Museum buy it from him. Lord Thomson of Fleet, the Canadian-based publisher, purchased the enamel casket at a Sotheby's auction in London last week for $6.5 million, and he is selling it for that price.
1996-07-09	Greek Goddess Back in Italian Arms	When the prominent New York art dealer Richard L. Feigen bought a 2,000-year-old marble sculpture of Artemis, the chaste Greek goddess of the moon, little did he know that the $130,000 purchase would turn out to be one big headache. At Sotheby's last summer, the Roman torso failed to garner a single bid. Then, last fall, a photograph of it in a glossy Sotheby's catalogue attracted the attention of Italian Government officials, who immediately recognized it as a piece of history that was stolen in 1988 from a convent near Naples.
1996-07-01	A Mystery Livens London Art Auctions	"A mysterious German-speaking collector went on a wild shopping spree at Sotheby's last week, buying approximately $22 million worth of paintings by Chagall, Renoir, Klee, Miro, Dubuffet, Freud and Bacon, among others. She bid by telephone to Agnes Husslein, Sotheby's Vienna representative, who was here for the Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions. Since the buyer asked that the auction house not reveal her identity, Sotheby's would say only that she was a woman who lived in Europe. While there has been frenzied speculation among experts as to who she is, the name that has surfaced most is that of Heidi Charmat, the widow of Helmut Horten, a Viennese owner of a department-store chain, who died in 1987, leaving her a reported $3 billion. Mrs. Charmat began buying art last year, experts say. She then married Jean Marc Charmat, a Frenchman, in 1994. It is thought that she will eventually open a museum or establish a foundation for the art. All of this speculation is unconfirmed. But the ""mystery buyer,"" as she came to be known, piqued everyone's curiosity not simply because she bought exclusively at one auction house -- unusual for someone so clearly building a new art collection -- but also for the sheer volume of works she bought and the prices she was willing to pay."
1996-06-30	Supersized Prices Paid For Old 10-Cent Comics	Fifty-eight years ago this month, a superhero made his debut on the cover of a comic book. He was strong enough to hold a four-door sedan over his head and brave enough to test the fashion standards of the day, with a daring ensemble of red cape and blue tights. Who was this caped man? And how did he get to be so strong? These and other burning questions could be answered only by buying the comic book. That is how America learned about a planet called Krypton, a spaceship carrying an infant to Earth and other details that could make a child momentarily forget the Depression's deprivations. It cost a dime.

1996-05-24	J.F.K. Trove Available For Love, Not Money	"Robert White just hates it when someone picks up one of the treasures of his collection and asks, ""So, what's this worth?"" He never started collecting John F. Kennedy memorabilia to get rich. Nor did he change his mind after 1,300 items owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis fetched a staggering $34.4 million at a Sotheby's auction last month in New York."
1996-05-10	Prices and Hopes Rise As Spring Art Auctions Reveal a Robust Market	The 1996 spring auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in Manhattan will not be remembered for their high prices. Nor will many blockbuster paintings stand out in anyone's mind. Still, these sales have made a significant impression on the art world because of the increase in the number and enthusiasm of buyers at every level. Even the market for contemporary art, which has been trying desperately to pull itself out of a five-year slump, got a big boost this week.
1996-05-09	Stars Fail to Shine at Contemporary-Art Auction	Bidding was thin at the top last night, so thin, in fact, that it made Sotheby's sale of contemporary art a lifeless affair. As has been true at all the important fine-art auctions of the last two weeks, the middle market -- works priced at $50,000 to $250,000 -- is where the action is. The sale totaled $13.4 million, far below the estimate of $23 million to $31 million. Of the 59 works offered, 14 did not sell, including a de Kooning that carried the highest estimate of the sale.
1996-05-05	Only Driven In Camelot?	"IT was a 1992 BMW 325i, metallic green with tan leather seats, and only 10,032 miles. Already, this sounds like the oldest cliche in a used-car salesman's repertoire. Would you believe it was driven only on Sundays by a little old lady from Pasadena? Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis certainly wasn't that, which is why her car sold for $79,500 -- like just about everything else at her estate auction last month, considerably more than Sotheby's had estimated ($18,000 to $22,000). ""And a lot more than it was really worth,"" declared Mark Luckman of the BMW Car Club of America."
1996-05-03	Would Mrs. Onassis Have Been Chagrined?	To the Editor: Mary Gordon (Op-Ed, April 28) may be offended by the fact that somebody would pay half a million dollars for John F. Kennedy's old cigar box, but she should not be surprised. As the rich keep getting richer while the rest of us are getting downsized, there are more people with more money than they know what to do with, and too little good taste not to flaunt it in public.
1996-05-03	Would Mrs. Onassis Have Been Chagrined?	"To the Editor: Maureen Dowd's ""Camelot 144"" (column, April 25) misses the point. Paying exorbitant prices for Jackie O's possessions says we place a high value on charisma. What's wrong with that? Better we recognize the extraordinary rather than the mediocre."
1996-05-03	Would Mrs. Onassis Have Been Chagrined?	"To the Editor: The mega-prices at the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction are a striking example of what Thorstein Veblen meant by the term ""conspicuous consumption."" It is pitiful to watch concentrated wealth boil over into sentimental trivia, while the cultural institutions that Mrs. Onassis loved are being starved to death."
1996-05-03	Would Mrs. Onassis Have Been Chagrined?	"To the Editor: Re Frank Rich's ""Sotheby's Sneak Preview"" (column, April 27), on the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate auction: F. Scott Fitzgerald was right. The rich are different. They're insane. If most bidders went in seeking a piece of Camelot, many came back with no more than a bit of Ari."
1996-05-02	Middle Market Steers a $64 Million Art Auction	Bidders kept Sotheby's salesroom buzzing for nearly two and a half hours last night as Impressionist and modern artworks sold whether they were important or not. For the first time in five years, the middle market -- works priced anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million -- formed the foundation of a solid sale. The auction totaled $64.5 million, below its low estimate of $71.9 million. Of the 68 works offered for sale, only 10 failed to find buyers.
1996-04-29	History in the Air, Nostalgia on the Block	"To the Editor: Maureen Dowd's ""Camelot 144"" (column, April 25) articulates the differences between history and nostalgia."
1996-04-28	Did Thoughts of April 15 Influence Auction Bids?	Believe it or not, a few souls at the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction at Sotheby's might not have been possessed by mass hysteria. Some might have been bidding instead with an eye on next April 15. Well, $574,500 for a humidor is a lot, even if Milton Berle did give it to the President. But if buying that humidor generates publicity, as it certainly has for Marvin Shanken, the publisher of Cigar Aficionado magazine, one might think of trying to write it off.
1996-04-28	They Payeth Much	"When I read that the fake pearls that belonged to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis were sold at Sotheby's auction for $211,500, I thought of the Gospel image of the pearl of great price. The merchant finds a pearl, sells everything he has and buys it. Then I thought of this sentence of Jesus's: ""Where your treasure lies, there also doth your heart lie."" And then I thought of Mary Magdalene falling at the feet of Jesus, bathing His feet with precious ointment, drying them with her hair. It is Judas, the betrayer, who says the ointment should have been sold and the money given to the poor. Jesus rebukes him. The poor you always have with you, He says, suggesting a mystery at the heart of our understanding of money and what it can buy."
1996-04-28	Reporter's Notebook;The Auction Aftermath: Was It Worth the Price?	The television crews have packed up their equipment. The bidders who lost out in the volleying for ever-higher prices have gone home empty-handed. And the buyers who shelled out megabucks at the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate auction at Sotheby's last week are facing the morning-after question: Did I pay too much? After all, the sale was more about who had touched the merchandise than about who had made it. Few of the items on the block were prime examples of an artist's work or a furniture maker's craftsmanship. And many were acquired after Mrs. Onassis left the White House, a period presumably less significant historically than the thousand or so days between John F. Kennedy's inauguration and his assassination.
1996-04-28	April 21-27;Celebrity for Sale	"Judging by Sotheby's $34.5 million auction of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' estate last week, a virulent strain of historiphilia has swept the land. Bidders who paid dearly -- $33,350 for a footstool daughter Caroline used, for example -- said they were clamoring for ""a piece of history."" Mostly, buyers were chasing relics of celebrity. True history buffs, who labeled the feverish buying ""souvenir hunting,"" wondered where these people were when the original Louisiana Purchase proclamation, signed by Jefferson and Madison, failed to sell at Christie's in January."

Never mind what the paragon of good taste and elegant simplicity might say: Ms. Grzesik is going to use it as a toothbrush holder.

You know this country's filthy rich should be placed under psychiatric watch when they are paying $25,300 for a set of the Encyclopedia Britannica with a volume missing, $13,800 for the Harvard '40 class-reunion report, $5,175 for an inscribed copy of A. L. Rowse's ""Homosexuals in History"" and $24,150 for a set of the dead President's stereo records. Please say that they don't include a banged-up copy of Xavier Cugat and Charo's ""Camelot Goes Cha-Cha-Cha."""
1996-04-26	Nothing From the White House, but There's a Degas	Wath all the commotion over the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sale, it was easy this week to forget that Sotheby's and Christie's are still in the business of selling art. Yet this weekend, about $300 million worth of Impressionist, modern and contemporary paintings, drawings and sculpture go on view at the two houses, heralding the official beginning of the spring auction season in Manhattan. The Picassos, van Goghs, de Koonings and Pollocks up for sale over the next two weeks are proof that there is more to auctions than the glamour and hype of a cel'brity name.
1996-04-26	Reporter's Notebook;Oohs, Aahs and Millions In Frenzy to Buy Camelot	And yesterday, the fake pearls sold for $211,500. Yes, they are the three strands of little round beads that John F.

And yet her voice betrayed an almost imperceptible disappointment, not at the notion of staggeringly high prices, but at the fact that she did not get to take home more. ""For this particular room on this particular day, it was market price,"" she said, noting that Sotheby's had estimated that the drawing would go for $800 to $1,200 and the mirror for $4,000 to $6,000. ""What I would have liked was to have bought about eight things,"" she said. ""I have five nieces and three stepdaughters and I would like to have bought them all a little piece of history."""

Not to mention the $48,875 tape measure and the $33,350 footstool with the cover that was faded, stained and torn. The long-anticipated four-day, three-night auction of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' possessions began last night with a bidding frenzy that led to staggering sale prices for a potpourri of items from the Kennedys' White House years. The rocking chair, for example, was said to have been especially comfortable for a President with back trouble.
1996-04-23	A Family Museum to Sell Off Cherished Art	The Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vt., which has one of the most esteemed art collections in the country, has decided to sell $25 million worth of art at Sotheby's this fall, in an effort to dig its way out of a financial mess. The decision came after two years of debate among the museum's directors, which became so contentious that the board chairman, J. Watson Webb, whose mother, Electra Havemeyer Webb, built the Shelburne in 1947, resigned in January. Mr. Webb said at the time that the museum's plans to sell off valuable French Impressionist works given to the museum by his mother were in violation of the code of ephics of the American Association of Museums, which forbids the selling of artworks for purposes other than acquiring more art.

By invitation only and before audiences of Christie's executives, the companies -- Ashforth-Warburg, Stribling, Corcoran, Douglas Elliman and Brown Harris Stevens -- made their presentations. When it was all over, Brown Harris Stevens was chosen; now several of the others have vowed to try again in four months, when the yearlong affiliation contract expires.

She was also one of its most private, a circumstance seemingly at odds with her family's putting up her lares and penates for public consumption. It is not. What the heirs of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis are selling is either distinguished but not to their taste (some charming drawings, for example, and a Regency games table) or undistinguished (a three-legged stool) or redundant (the Boston rocker is only one of several owned by J.F.K.). There is miscellaneous jewelry ranging from fake pearls to a boar's-tooth necklace. There are wedding presents from the Onassis family. It is safe to assume that there was little argument about whether to sell the Timex watch.

The Sotheby's auction room, which was crowded with standees, grew hushed as the bidding began in late afternoon. The auctioneer, David Redden, ended the bidding when he announced a final offer of $3.3 million, a price below what the owner -- whose name has not been disclosed -- was willing to accept.
1996-03-15	Einstein Manuscript Up for Auction Shows Science Can Be Art	What turns a piece of paper into history is that it marks a seminal moment, a point in time when conventional thinking was challenged and forever changed. What makes it art is not only the peculiar beauty of its yellowed pages, faded ink or elegant script, but that it lives, infused with the spirit of the author's hand. The manuscript in which Albert Einstein elaborated on his special theory of relativity is both: momentous as one of the central scientific tenets of the modern age, and captivating as a window into how the gears turned in one of the greatest minds in history.
1996-03-10	March 3-9;Moscow, I Have A Problem	Children these days know more about the near disaster of Apollo 13 than the triumph of Apollo 11 and the successful landing of a dozen American astronauts on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. But maybe there's a space blockbuster to be made that can have enough drama to make money and still honor a goal that was achieved. It turns out that Yuri A. Gagarin, the first man in space, who was launched into history by the Soviet Union in 1961, had a remarkably dangerous ride -- a detail that was hidden for decades behind the veil of Communist propaganda. In fact, man's first voyage beyond the planet was nearly a disaster.
1996-03-06	Over the Top in an Auction Catalogue	"The cover is so self-consciously quiet it looks more like a wedding album than an auction-house catalogue. Yet the cool white cotton cover with discreet silver lettering that says only ""The Estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis April 23-26, 1996,"" with Sotheby's name in small letters at the bottom, has captured the public's curiosity in a way no other auction catalogue ever has. This 584-page publication, which is $90 in hard cover and $45 in paperback, is soon to be a Sotheby's best seller. That its cover has no enticing photograph (an auction house standard) matters not a whit. Inside is what counts: details on more than 4,000 pieces of art, furniture and jewelry and other objects that once belonged to the former First Lady, along with nearly 800 illustrations and personal remembrances."
1996-03-05	Russian Space Mementos Show Gagarin's Ride was a Rough One	THE launching of the first human into space by the Soviet Union -- a 108-minute dash around the globe by Lieut. Yuri A. Gagarin on April 12, 1961 -- stunned the world, particularly the United States, which at the time was struggling to catch up in the space race. Shortly after the Soviet success, President Kennedy, under enormous pressure to outdo the Communists, announced a bold plan to land Americans on the Moon by the end of the decade. But it turns out that Lieutenant Gagarin's flight aboard Vostok 1 was far from the seamless triumph that Moscow publicized for so many decades. In fact, man's first voyage beyond the planet was nearly a disaster, Western aerospace experts have learned.
1996-03-04	France Ending Auctions Monopoly	Over the last 30 years, as London and New York gradually replaced Paris as the main international marketplaces for art, antiques and antiquities, French auctioneers at least remained masters of their own house. Their share of world trade in art continued to fall, but by law they alone could hold auctions in France. Now even this is to change. As of Jan. 1, 1998, that four-centuries-old monopoly will be abolished and for the first time the two art-trading giants, Sotheby's and Christie's, will be allowed to organize auctions here. Whether French auctioneers can survive the shock is unclear. Yet without it, France's enfeebled art market seems doomed to further decline.
1996-02-25	Jackie Was Here	DURING HER FAMOUS TELEVISED WHITE House tour in 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy breathlessly recounted that Abraham Lincoln once grew upset with his wife over how much she paid for a rug. Jackie herself was clearly entranced with extravagant purchases, and with the telling anecdote behind the ordinary object. She devoted her own time as First Lady to amassing a huge collection of such artifacts -- each, presumably, with its own anecdotal richness. How odd, then, that some 1,200 lots' worth of items from her personal estate, to be auctioned starting on April 23 at Sotheby's, remain so adamantly mute about their collector. Not a single pillbox hat, no sunglasses, no Oleg Cassini suits. The entire sprawl is pervaded by a cool impersonality, as if the auction were mounted only to deepen Jackie's impenetrable mystique. Few of the items are identified as from her post-White House life -- we aren't encouraged to contemplate the private Jackie, only the former First Lady. And, unlike other recent estate sales, this one has precious little that lends itself to fetishizing.

1996-02-04	What Rocks and Is a Seat of State?	THE ROCKING CHAIR, THE MOST American of all furniture forms, has been a favorite of statesmen since the 18th century. Benjamin Franklin added metal bends to the base of his outsized library chair to make it rock, and Abraham Lincoln was assassinated while sitting in a Victorian rocker that had been installed at Ford Theater especially for him that night. John F. Kennedy's rocker, of course, became an icon of his White House years. Now, a footnote will be added to the story of the American rocker when 2 of the 12 identical ones that were owned by President Kennedy are auctioned in April at Sotheby's in New York. The chairs come from the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and are expected to bring $3,000 to $5,000 each.

1996-01-19	A Cornucopia Of Americana	WHEN the Winter Antiques Show began 42 years ago, there was nothing to compare to this patriotically American event and nothing else on the calendar to entice collectors to visit Manhattan during the bleak days of January. But in a city like New York, one is never enough. Now the Winter Antiques Show, which opens today and runs through Jan. 28 at the Seventh Regiment Armory, has company. The show has inspired a host of imitators: smaller, less expensive antiques shows that are all around the city this weekend. There are also special gallery exhibitions organized by dealers who do not exhibit at the Winter Antiques Show. And there are auctions: both Sotheby's and Christie's time their important American furniture and decorative arts auctions to coincide with the Winter Antiques Show because they realize that many of their important clients will be in town.

     Then his accountants told him that he would have to pay more than $1 million  extra in taxes to bring the works back home to Buenos Aires, and he was outraged. So like dozens of other Argentine collectors who face the same tax liability, Mr. Costantini decided to leave his purchases on deposit in New York."

Most of these magnificent outfits may be a bit pricey for neighborhood masquerading -- this gold lame sea monster designed by the Russian artist Natalia Gontcharova in 1916 is expected to fetch $13,000 -- but as pure art they may be bargains. The 100 exotic items were assembled by George Howard, the late chairman of the BBC, in the 1960's and 70's, and include work by Henri Matisse, Leon Bakst and Georges Braque.

1995-11-17	Picasso Shines, Contemporary Artists Don't	The most striking thing about this fall's two weeks of fine-art auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's, which ended Wednesday night, is how far the gulf has widened between the market for Impressionist and modern art and that for contemporary art. Works by masters like van Gogh and Picasso, Modigliani and Leger sold for multimillion-dollar prices, and enthusiasm from a growing group of serious collectors proved not only how solid this segment of the art market is, but also how much it has grown over the last 18 months. Contemporary art, on the other hand, is still recovering from a five-year slump. This market, too, is growing, but in baby steps. Because its collectors are generally younger, auction houses rarely get prized estate property that includes contemporary art.
1995-11-16	Low-Risk Auction Ends Fall Sales	If one wanted to describe a 1990's-style auction, it would be last night's sale of contemporary art at Sotheby's. By all accounts the evening was a success, but the mood was restrained, with few excesses and absolutely no excitement. The sale totaled $19.8 million, just over Sotheby's low estimate of $18.4 million. Of the 57 works offered, 47 sold. Sotheby's results were better than Christie's; the contemporary-art sale there on Tuesday night brought only $14.5 million.

1995-11-09	Sotheby's Stretches, and Van Gogh Soars	Sotheby's was pushing its luck last night, but its sale of Impressionist and modern art served as a sobering reality check. Yes, the market is strong, stronger than it has been for five years. But the ingredients have to be right. When an artwork is fresh and of excellent quality, buyers are willing to reach for the moon. When it's not, no amount of slick marketing can disguise greedy estimates or stale merchandise. Of the 88 works offered, 65 found buyers. The sale totaled $113.6 million, below the house estimate of $126 million to $174 million.
1995-11-08	Rare Verdi Sketches For 'Otello' Are Up For Sale in London	"When the other shoe of a Verdi mystery thudded to the floor recently, few seemed to realize that there had been a first. Two weeks ago, Sotheby's auction house in London told several European newspapers that previously unknown sketches for Giuseppe Verdi's ""Otello"" would be put on sale on Dec. 1 and were expected to fetch as much as $320,000, a record price for a Verdi musical manuscript."
1995-11-03	At the Auctions This Fall, The Really Expensive Art	THE stakes for Impressionist, modern and contemporary masterworks keep rising as the number of multimillion-dollar paintings at auction grows. The reason is more providential than practical: the deaths of several passionate collectors over the past year mean an infusion of fresh art into the market. Important estate material is crucial to both Sotheby's and Christie's. It's the bait that catches the other big fish. But whether the waters will be rough or smooth over the next two weeks, when about $350 million worth of art is offered for sale in Manhattan, is anyone's guess. The fact that anything can (and does) happen in the auction room makes these sales the art world's most popular sport. Spectators and players alike are affected. Auction prices give dealers a barometer by which to gauge their own material. Moreover, the mood in the auction room is contagious. It affects the buying and selling climate around the world.
1995-10-25	A Princely House Sale in Baden-Baden	"The desire for a memento of princely history, even if it's just an empty picture frame or a cuckoo clock with the noble coat of arms, is compelling, and Sotheby's played on that desire at a huge recent auction in Germany to draw crowds so large and prices so high that it surprised even itself. ""We knew it would do well,"" said Christoph Graf Douglas, managing director of Sotheby's in Germany. ""We never thought it would do this well."""
1995-10-12	Even Ralph Lauren Runs Out of Rooms	RALPH LAUREN, the purveyor of tweedy clothing and Old World atmosphere, has been an insatiable collector of arcane, often English furniture and decorations that have served as backdrops and props in his shops and showrooms (but not his own living rooms). Even Mr. Lauren runs out of storage space. Yesterday, he sold 443 lots of European and American furniture -- some antiques, others vaguely old -- for $2.5 million (including buyers' premiums) at Sotheby's in New York. The sale's top bid of $290,000 came near the end of the afternoon session for a Gobelins tapestry showing two oxen pulling a cart. The bid far exceeded the auction house's estimate of $60,000 to $80,000.
1995-10-07	At a Castle in Germany, A King-Size Yard Sale	When an ancient and respectable family is reduced to selling its furniture, crockery, paintings and even hunting trophies to pay off its debts, thoughts about the transitory nature of wealth may be evoked. But as Sotheby's began auctioning off the entire contents of a castle owned by the venerable House of Baden here this week, tears of sympathy were perhaps premature. Germany may have abolished its principalities in 1918, but the head of this dynasty still carries the august title of His Royal Highness Max Margrave of Baden. More to the point, the family still owns three other castles in western Germany packed with treasures that are not on the block. And after just two days of the 15-day auction, described by Sothe by's as the largest of its kind ever held, the family was already $21.2 million better off.
2014-01-02	What Presence! What Prices!	SISTER PARISH once thought $40 was an appallingly high price for an upholstered chair. So, she probably would have been revolted to step into the salesrooms of Sotheby's and see the prices her own objects are expected to bring when they go on sale tomorrow morning. It is estimated that a pair of Italian tole urns painted with scenes of Oriental women could bring from $20,000 to $30,000 and that a Queen Anne gilt mirror could fetch $25,000 to $35,000.
1995-09-17	Hold the Pledge. A Little Grime on the Finish, Please.	"GOURMETS WOULD PROBABLY agree more quickly on the best crust to be found on bread than connoisseurs would on the choicest crust on 18th-century American furniture. Crust, also known to the cognoscenti by the inelegant word crud, is the decomposed varnish, wax, dust and grime that accumulates, dulling the finish of even the most magnificent furniture. This delightfully esoteric topic is likely to dominate conversation in Americana circles between now and Jan. 20, when some of the crustiest 200-year-old furniture to be auctioned in decades is offered at Sotheby's in New York. Of the 230 items for sale, 85 remain in an untouched -- some might say shabby -- state, with mucky surfaces and torn upholstery. Sotheby's bills the pieces as the ""premier collection of American furniture ever to come on the market"" and expects them to take in about $6 million."

There was a catch: it was parked on the moon and would be for the foreseeable future. ""That was the first auction on earth of an object on another heavenly body,"" said the 46-year-old Mr. Redden. ""The bidders bought the vision of owning a dune buggy on the moon, with no hope of ever physically possessing it. More than anything else, of course, it was an auction of an idea."""
1995-08-16	Early Recording by Monroe	"A recently rediscovered recording by Marilyn Monroe is to be auctioned by Sotheby's in London on Sept. 13. The song, a plaintive ballad titled ""How Wrong Can I Be,"" was apparently recorded in late 1948 or early 1949, when the actress was just 22 and struggling to gain a foothold in Hollywood. Accompanied by a piano and muted trumpet, Monroe delivers the song in a torchy, seductive style with an occasional jazzy inflection and barely a hint of her breathy, whispery renditions of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,"" ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"" or ""I Just Want to Be Loved by You."" The voice is sultry, a little off-key from time to time, and instantly recognizable."

This was no afterthought: part of the terminal's $8 million renovation included creating proper spaces to show paintings, sculpture and prints. Jeffrey Deitch, a private dealer based in New York, masterminded the project. ""I've been concerned that the art business has not found enough new collectors to replace those from the 80's who have disappeared,"" he said in a telephone interview this week. ""Making a terminal into a giant art gallery means that thousands of people will see the works every day."""
1995-07-14	Inside Art	Expensive in Tokyo Ever since the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo opened four months ago, it has been trying to get as much attention as, say, the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris or the Tate Gallery of Modern Art in London, which has already had a flurry of publicity even though it is not scheduled to open until 2000. Unfortunately, most of the attention has been critical. The city-run institution is Tokyo's first contemporary-art museum, and the cost has been astronomical. Its six-story, 330,000-square-foot building, designed by Takahito Yanagisawa, a local architect, cost $481 million. And its location, about 40 minutes by car from downtown Tokyo, is too out of the way, experts say, to attract many visitors.
1995-07-07	Inside Art	Art for Profit Buying art purely as an investment is an idea commonly frowned upon in the art world today. But 21 years ago, when the British Rail Pension Fund decided to invest 2.9 percent of its assets in Impressionist and Old Master paintings, Old Master drawings, Chinese and European works of art and antiquities, it was a downright scandal. It was considered outrageous that railroad workers' money was being invested in something as elitist as art, and Sotheby's, the pension fund's adviser, was thought to have a conflict of interest because most of the art was bought at auction.
1995-07-01	Art Finds Its Buyers At Sales In London	"The sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, which ended here on Thursday, were the most successful that Christie's and Sotheby's had seen in London in five years. While neither auction house was selling material from big-name estates, each offered a handful of top-quality paintings, which buyers from both sides of the Atlantic fought hard to own. The week's most exciting moment was at Christie's on Monday evening when Monet's ""Rouen Cathedral, Afternoon Effect (Full Sunlight on the Front Entrance),"" a sun-dappled view of the building's facade, one of a series of 30 variations the artist painted of the cathedral from 1892 to 1894, sold for $12.1 million, more than twice Christie's estimate of $5.5 million. The painting went to an unidentified collector who bid by telephone."

""Can you believe this chair?"" said Robert C. Woolley, Sotheby's director of decorative arts. ""I hate Americana."" The complaint is the kind of thing that friends and acquaintances have come to expect from the 52-year-old esthete, who years ago threw another fund-raising party at which guests could come as ""old friends"" for $500, ""new friends"" for $250 or ""acquaintances"" for $100."

The castle belongs to the Margrave Max von Baden, the 61-year-old nephew of the Duke of Edinburgh, first cousin of Prince Charles and grandson of Prince Max von Baden, the last chancellor of the imperial government.

This week, it said it would stop its exhibition program next year and disperse its 1,500-piece collection of contemporary and modern art.
1995-05-21	Books That Ask to Be Judged by Their Covers	SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL books in the world, bound in leather and emblazoned on the covers with Cubist and abstract images, are rarely exhibited. Their owners tend to protect these fragile objects from light and dust, studying them alone or in the company of very few people. In fact, one collector is so private in guarding his French modernist bindings, which are coming up for sale next month, that he has kept them in a Manhattan warehouse for a decade. Oddly, in this rarefied field of collecting, which is dominated by Europeans, this particular collection is owned by an American, Frederick R. Koch, the reclusive scion of a Kansas oil family. In the early and mid-1980's, Mr. Koch acquired the bindings, all of which cover 20th-century French books that contain illustrations by artists of that period. He bought most of the 300 or so bindings in bulk, purchasing three collections. Two had been formed in the 1920's and 1930's by Henri Vever, a Paris jeweler, and Carlos R. Scherrer, an Argentine businessman. The third had been assembled in the 1950's and 1960's by a Montreal collector who has not been identified.

So when Anne d'Harnoncourt, the museum's director, learned that Madonna was an admirer of the photographer Tina Modotti, she approached her to see if she would be interested in supporting a major Modotti exhibition scheduled to open in Philadelphia on Sept. 16. ""We proposed and she accepted,"" Ms. d'Harnoncourt said."
1995-05-18	Lloyd Webber Ends Picasso Mystery	"The composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber was the buyer of Picasso's portrait of the artist Angel Fernandez de Soto at Sotheby's in New York City on May 8, it was announced yesterday. Sir Andrew paid $29.1 million for the work, which is from the artist's blue period. That was the highest price paid for any painting since the art-market boom ended in 1990. The announcement, which was made by Sir Andrew from his London office, ended art-world speculation about the identity of the buyer. There are only a handful of collectors who would be interested in purchasing such a work and are wealthy enough to do so; many experts were betting on the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos. Mr. Niarchos, a Picasso collector, purchased ""Yo Picasso,"" a 1901 self-portrait, for $47.9 million at auction in 1989, at the height of the market."
1995-05-10	After a High-Rolling Night, Art Sales Flatten Out	Sotheby's sales of Impressionist and modern art continued last night, but unlike Monday evening, when protracted bidding wars brought record-breaking prices, the auction was a somber affair of bottom-fishing and restraint. The sale totaled $43 million, below Sotheby's estimate of $50.4 million to $69.3 million. Of the 66 works for sale, 52 found buyers.
1995-05-09	Stakes at Auctions Rise Again: A Collection Brings $65 Million	An intense week of four consecutive evening sales of Impressionist and modern art got off to a dazzling start last night at Sotheby's, where a Picasso portrait of the artist Angel Fernandez de Soto (1903) brought a staggering $29.1 million, the highest price paid for a painting since the art market took a nose dive in 1990. Another stunning price, $18.85 million, was paid for a Matisse, setting a record for the artist. That the auction performed so well was understandable. All the works were from the collection of Donald and Jean Stralem of New York. Mr. Stralem, who died in 1976, was a banker, and Mrs. Stralem, who died last year, was a prominent philanthropist. Her grandfather was Philip Lehman, the banker whose holdings formed the basis of the Lehman Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
1995-05-04	Second Night of Caution at Auction	Where has the passion gone? While the buyers were out in full force last night at Christie's sale of contemporary art, caution was the watchword. Works sold, but few takers were willing to reach for the stars and push prices beyond their estimates. The sale totaled $11.3 million, not too far below Christie's estimate of $13 million to $17 million. Of the 52 works offered, 44 found buyers. Sotheby's sale of contemporary art on Tuesday night made $13 million, also below the house estimate of $15.7 million to $22 million. At Sotheby's, 36 of the 46 works found buyers. Americans dominated the buying on both nights.
1995-05-03	A Subdued Start to Spring Auctions	The usual suspects packed Sotheby's salesroom last night for the first important art auction of the spring. While the audience looked the same as it always does, the crowd of dealers and collectors, art experts and auction-house groupies who came to watch and to bid on contemporary art didn't act the same. Hadn't they taken their vitamins? Bidding was cautious, if not anemic. But the auction still managed to total a respectable $13 million, not far below Sotheby's estimate of $15.7 million to $22 million. Of the 46 works offered for sale, 36 found buyers.
1995-04-28	Spring Auctions: Riches To Delight The Eye	NT since the boom years of the late 1980's have Sotheby's and Christie's had so many drop-dead Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture for sale. But the wealth of Picassos and Matisses, Vuillards and Monets that have found their way to auction this spring speak less about the state of the market than about providential occurrences. A number of well-known collectors died this winter, leaving estates that are chockablock with first-rate art, the kind that may have been lent to museums for special exhibitions but otherwise never left the Park Avenue living rooms where it hung for generations.

1995-04-23	The Key to Auctions . . . Lot, Bid and Gavel	"IT'S high season for New York's big auctioneers. From now through June, there's practically a sale a day at either Christie's or Sotheby's. Sometimes both. If you've ever hankered to get in on the auction action, now is the time. Both auctioneers have been putting out the welcome mat for new buyers, in hopes they will give the market new momentum. And yet to many, the prospect of crossing the threshold of an auction house is daunting. Auctions are seen as havens for tuxedo-clad men and jewel-bedecked women who emerge from limousines to spend millions of dollars on van Goghs -- and do it in a pressure-cooker atmosphere that brooks no morning-after changes of heart. ""Even though I was once an auctioneer, I find that my pulse quickens noticeably when I bid,"" said Jennifer Vorbach, director of C&M Arts, a gallery in Manhattan's East Side."

Four years ago, this seemed an unlikely prospect as sales of Louis Comfort Tiffany's works faltered in the recession. But their popularity was soon restored, auction records were broken, and now a miniboom appears to be developing, set off by the spirited buying of several new collectors. The real test of the market will come on Saturday, when Sotheby's in New York auctions 75 Tiffany lamps, the largest collection ever to go on the block. The lamps, which are expected to bring a total of $6 million to $9 million, are owned by John W. Mecom Jr., a Houston oil heir and real estate investor who is the former owner of the New Orleans Saints football team.

For years, both Sotheby's and Christie's have supposedly charged sellers 10 percent of the purchase price on items that sell for more than $7,500; 15 percent on items selling for $2,000 to $7,500, and 20 percent on items selling for less than $2,000. But with sellers offering extremely expensive items, both auction houses have negotiated the fee, often eliminating it altogether. (The auction house also receives a percentage of the price from the buyer.)
1995-03-31	Inside Art	And the Winner Is. . . . The fate of the last big estate of the spring season has been decided, and once it was determined that the art would go to auction, word from inside Sotheby's and Christie's revealed that it was a tight race. Sotheby's is the winner. The prize is Margaret Kahn Ryan's collection of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, which includes works by Monet, Pissarro and Cezanne and is estimated by Sotheby's to be worth more than $10 million.
1995-03-30	For Folk Art's Sake	THERE'S nothing like a country auction to inspire bidding fever. At least that's what the Museum of American Folk Art is counting on when Sotheby's, 1334 York Avenue, at 72d Street, auctions folk art donated to benefit the museum, on April 11. (Previews begin April 8.)
1995-03-24	Inside Art	Selling Off a House as Well as Art When the Museum of Modern Art inherited Gordon and Nina Bunshaft's estate last year, there was speculation about what exactly the museum would do with the bonanza of contemporary and modern art, not to mention the Bunshafts' 1962 house in East Hampton, L.I., a 2,600-square-foot pavilion of glass, travertine, marble and concrete. The house had been designed by Mr. Bunshaft, the internationally known architect and partner at Skidmore Owings & Merrill, which designed such New York City landmarks as Lever House and 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza. He died in 1990 and his wife last May.
1995-03-17	Inside Art	"What's a van Gogh Worth? $7 Million? A van Gogh portrait has come on the auction market for the first time in five years. On May 11, Christie's in New York is selling ""Young Man in a Cap"" (1888), a striking portrait of a peasant painted against an acid-yellow background. While the auction house won't be pinned down on exactly how much it expects the portrait to bring, Nancy Whyte, who heads Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art in New York, estimates it could fetch anywhere from $7 million to $9 million."
1995-03-17	Modern's Ex-Chief Joins Sotheby's	Richard E. Oldenburg, who was director of the Museum of Modern Art for 21 years before resigning in 1993, has been named chairman of Sotheby's America. Mr. Oldenburg succeeds John Marion, who retired from Sotheby's at the end of 1994 and is now its honorary chairman. Unlike Mr. Marion, who built his 35-year career at Sotheby's as an auctioneer, Mr. Oldenburg will not conduct sales. Instead, he will focus on obtaining works of art for sale and will confer with museums on appraisals, acquisitions and sales. He will also advise Sotheby's on its educational programs.
1995-02-27	A Springtime Windfall of Art at Auction	Fate has dealt Sotheby's and Christie's lucky hands. In May, both auction houses are to sell some of the most outstanding examples of Impressionist and modern art that either auction house has seen in five years. So far, more than $100 million worth of Impressionist and modern art will be up for sale over a four-day period beginning on May 8. The collections are so large that there are to be four consecutive evening sales, twice the amount regularly scheduled. Besides a Picasso, a Renoir and a Matisse that Christie's is selling for Pamela C. Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, both Sotheby's and Christie's have secured art from prominent New York estates.
1995-02-24	Inside Art	"A Thrift-Shop Dali Here is an art-world fairy tale, the kind that everyone with a passion for antiquing dreams about, but one that almost never comes true. One morning in December, Robert Loughlin, who is well known in the antiques world as a picker (someone who sells his finds to other dealers), was first in line waiting for the doors of a SoHo thrift shop to open. Once inside, he spied something rolled up under a rack of men's pants. ""I grabbed it,"" Mr. Loughlin said."
1995-02-19	Notes Reveal 'Profoundly Humane' Whitman	The nurse recorded in his notebook each wounded soldier's simple request, for an orange, a piece of horehound candy or to have a book read to him, and the nurse obliged as he could. He noted his patients' names and addresses, and for those who could not write, he wrote letters to their families. By the name of each who died, he drew a cross. The chronicler was Walt Whitman. The notes, taken while he worked as a nurse in a Union Army hospital in Washington during the Civil War, are part of the contents of four notebooks of Whitman's that turned up recently at Sotheby's in Manhattan, after more than half a century missing and presumed stolen.
1995-02-18	4 Whitman Notebooks Turn Up After 53 Years	Four notebooks of Walt Whitman, missing from the Library of Congress for more than half a century, have been identified by Sotheby's and will be returned to Government archives, the auction house announced yesterday. A man going through his late father's estate found the notebooks, along with a paper butterfly depicted in a famous portrait photograph of Whitman, and asked Sotheby's to evaluate them in January, said the auction house. It said it was precluded from identifying the client or his father and said there was no explanation of how the papers had come to be in private hands.
1995-02-17	Inside Art	"Gift of a Delacroix and a Monet Jayne Wrightsman, a longtime trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one of its biggest donors, has an eye for recognizing gaps in the museum's collections and then filling them in. This week the museum received the gift of two important paintings from Mrs. Wrightsman's private collection. The rarer is Delacroix's ""Portrait of Madame Henri Francois Riesener (Felicite Longrois)."" ""The museum didn't have a Delacroix portrait,"" Mrs. Wrightsman said. Delacroix painted few portraits and almost all of them were of intimate friends or members of his family. This one, from 1835, is of his aunt."
1995-02-10	Inside Art	"Maryland Collection to Be Sold On the heels of last month's auction of some of the art and objects belonging to the financially distressed New-York Historical Society comes word that the Maryland Institute of Art in Baltimore is preparing to go it one better. And just as the Historical Society's decision did, the news that the art school intends to sell its entire art collection to raise money has caused an uproar in the art world. The collection has been on loan to the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore for more than 50 years. ""We are absolutely against this kind of de-accessioning,"" the executive director of the Association of Art Museum Directors, Mimi Guardieri, said. ""The collection is important educationally. If it is lost to Baltimore, it would be, well, unfortunate is not a strong enough word."""
1995-02-04	Chronicle	"No one was supposed to be bidding on the 350 works displayed at Sotheby's on Thursday night at the opening of an exhibition of art by students and teachers from the New York City public schools. ""But people are making offers anyway,"" said LOIS H. RIVKIN, president of Friends of the Public Schools, a nonprofit group that serves as a liaison between the schools and the cultural and business worlds. ""This isn't supposed to be a fund-raiser,"" she said. ""It's just a party."""
1995-01-20	Met Museum Pre-empts Sale of Old Master	"The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced yesterday that it had exercised an option to buy a work that was part of an auction of Old Master paintings from the financially troubled New-York Historical Society at Sotheby's last week. The highest bidder for the painting -- Lo Scheggia's ""Triumph of Fame,"" a 1449 circular painting that was the birth plate of Lorenzo de' Medici -- was Reiner Zeitz, a London dealer who was willing to pay $2.2 million. But under an agreement worked out last fall by the Historical Society, Sotheby's and the New York State Attorney General, state institutions had the right to match any offer made on the 183 Old Master paintings within seven days of the Jan. 12 sale. The New York Times erroneously reported such an action by the Met last Friday, when it had not yet taken place."
1995-01-14	Correction: Met Denies Blocking Sale of Painting	"The Metropolitan Museum of Art said yesterday that it did not step in at an auction on Thursday to pre-empt the sale of Lo Scheggia's ""Triumph of Fame"" to a London dealer who had offered $2.2 million. The New York Times erroneously reported such an action yesterday. ""We never said it's not possible,"" said Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the museum. ""But no decision has been made on whether or not to do so."""
1995-01-13	Inside Art	"Didn't Leave Home When Eli Broad flew to New York in November to attend Sotheby's sale of contemporary art, he didn't leave home without his American Express card. In fact, the Los Angeles collector used his little piece of plastic to buy Roy Lichtenstein's ""I . . . I'm Sorry,"" a painting from 1965-66, for which he paid $2.5 million. While the auction house, which has been accepting the American Express card (but not Mastercard or Visa) since September, does not generally discuss the payment methods of its clients, Mr. Broad's office confirmed that he had bought the painting with his American Express card. William Ruprecht, Sotheby's managing director for North and South America, said this was certainly ""not a typical transaction and not something Sotheby's sees on a daily basis."" (The painting was the most expensive work in the sale.)"
1995-01-13	Met Blocks Sale to Keep Old Master For Itself	"The Metropolitan Museum of Art yesterday stepped in to buy Lo Scheggia's ""Triumph of Fame,"" among 183 Old Master paintings being sold by the New-York Historical Society, which is raising money to keep operating. The painting attracted a bid of $2.2 million from a London dealer yesterday at a sale at Sotheby's. But the Met, exercising an option that gave right of first refusal to New York institutions, agreed to match the offer, thereby keeping a work that it had exhibited on loan from the society since 1979."
1995-01-03	Going Once, Going Twice: The Art of the Auctioneer	"He peered intently into her eyes. Then slowly, leaning down as close to her as he could, he paused and in a soft, intimate voice said, ""I'll take $3,000,050?"" All he got in return was an icy stare. Her paddle, it seemed, would never leave her lap again."
1994-12-30	Inside Art	Dealer's Collection Collectors are always fascinated with what dealers buy for themselves. The professional eye, they believe, sees what others do not. Which may explain why the sale of sculpture and other artworks belonging to Cyril Humphris, the London-based sculpture dealer, at Sotheby's in New York on Jan. 10 and 11, is important to many people in the art world.
1994-12-23	Inside Art	Venezuelan Shift For 24 hours, Meyer Vaisman thought he was the artist chosen to represent Venezuela in the 1995 Venice Biennale. The Venezuelan artist, who lives in New York City and is represented by three SoHo galleries, had applied for the coveted position twice before and been passed over for other artists. But this time, at a Dec. 6 meeting of the National Council of Culture's advisory board (the Venezuelan committee that selects the representing artist for the Biennale), 6 of 10 members voted for Mr. Vaisman.
1994-12-15	A Dream in Harlem Ends at the Gavel	FOR years, Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum in Harlem was a fixture where schoolchildren and collectors were welcome and ordinary grown-ups had to persevere to gain entry. Aunt Len was Lenon Holder Hoyte, a retired public school art teacher who amassed one of the most extensive and varied private collections of dolls and toys in the country.
1994-12-09	Inside Art	Turnabout at Sotheby's Sotheby's made an impressive score last week at its Manhattan auction of American paintings, drawings and sculpture. For the first time since the mid-1980's, American art sales eclipsed the figures at earlier sales of Latin American and contemporary art. The sale totaled $24.9 million, above the auction house's lower estimate of $21.5 million. Last month, the big Latin American sale totaled $13.4 million, and the evening contemporary sale brought in $12.1 million.
1994-12-02	Inside Art	The London Auctions While the pickings were the weakest in memory, the responses at the sales of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture in London this week were not. Bidding was active at both Sotheby's and Christie's, and a few works even brought strong prices. But neither house achieved totals as high as those in the November sales of Impressionist and modern art in New York. Sotheby's London sale made $17.7 million, just below the estimate of $17.9 million to $24.1 million. Christie's fared better, as it had in New York, with a total of $23.5 million, a bit above its low estimate of $21.9 million. (In New York, Sotheby's sale brought $25.8 million and Christie's reached $37.5 million.)
1994-11-25	Inside Art	"3 Recordings Later When Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's director, is enamored of a painting, he has been known to ramble on a bit.

1994-11-20	Forces Marshaled for Battle on Airport Rail Link	Battle lines are being drawn over a prized Manhattan real-estate site -- the shuttered Alexander's at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue. Well-financed forces have retained high-powered lawyers in a fight that could rival epic development struggles like Westway and Columbus Circle. The confrontation has also fostered an unlikely alliance between two frequent adversaries on zoning issues: developers and civic groups.
2014-01-02	A Stolen Old Master Painting Is Bought Back for Poland	"A Dutch Old Master painting stolen from a Polish museum by German forces during World War II has been bought for the Polish Government in a convoluted deal that some experts deplore as ransom. The 17th-century Gabriel Metsu painting, called ""The Washerwoman,"" was flown to Warsaw from New York on Tuesday after payment of about $65,000 to an anonymous collector who had consigned the work to Sotheby's nearly two years ago for auction. The painting was withdrawn by the auction house after a Polish art restorer in New Jersey spotted the work in a Sotheby's catalogue and questioned its sale."
1994-11-11	In Small but Sure Ways, the Art Market Shifts	There were subtle changes this fall in the complexion of the market for contemporary, Impressionist and modern art in Manhattan. Both Sotheby's and Christie's edited their auctions, making them leaner and more carefully thought out than the spring sales. Catalogues were smaller, and the art was generally of better quality. This was the season for repairing the damage done in the spring, when greedy estimates coupled with stale offerings resulted in disaster. The auction houses wanted their fall sales, which ended yesterday, to inspire confidence.
1994-11-10	Dealers Buying Again At Impressionist Sales	There's been a sea change in the market for Impressionist and modern art. At this week's auctions, which ended last night at Christie's, buyers tended to be either serious connoisseurs or dealers. Gone are the days of impulse buying. Gone, too, is a market so inflated that dealers and old-time collectors were priced out. Almost half the works sold last night were bought by dealers. At Sotheby's on Tuesday night, dealers snapped up 25 percent of the sale.
1994-11-02	Up-and-Down Night Opens Fall Auctions	Neither low estimates nor heavy pre-sale marketing swayed the international group of buyers who packed Sotheby's salesroom in Manhattan last night. Buyers did their homework before the contemporary-art auction, the first in a two-week round of important fall sales. When price and quality found common ground, artworks sold, often with competitive bidding. But when either of those ingredients was missing, the room went dead. Of the 71 works up for sale, 43 found buyers. The sale totaled $12.1 million, less than the low estimate of $14 million to $19 million.
1994-11-02	Music Notes	Schumann's 2d of 4 The manuscript of Robert Schumann's Second Symphony, which has been in a private collection and unavailable to scholars since 1950, is to be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on Dec. 1. The auction house expects it to sell for about $1.42 million, roughly the price the manuscript of Schumann's Piano Concerto brought in November 1989. The record price for the sale of classical music manuscripts was set in 1987, when nine Mozart symphonies sold for $4.5 million. The manuscript will be on display at Sotheby's in New York City from Tuesday to Friday next week. If the score is acquired by a library and comes under scholarly scrutiny, it could yield at least subtle changes in the way the music is performed, since it includes alterations and corrections Schumann made as late as 1853. Modern editions of the work are based mainly on the version that was published in 1847.
1994-10-28	The Works To Watch At Auction	LIKE traders who compulsively watch the stock market to see where the smart buys are, collectors, dealers and curators peruse Sotheby's and Christie's catalogues in hopes of discovering either bargains or great works they haven't seen on the market before. This will be especially true in the next two weeks as the important round of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions takes place in New York. This fall's sales, which begin on Tuesday at Sotheby's, offer a smattering of everything. But taken as a whole, the artworks, thought to be worth more than $140 million, are nothing to crow about. While the offerings, which go on view starting this weekend, include works by masters like Monet and van Gogh, Warhol and Lichtenstein, the sales are generally thinner than they have been in years. Gone is the glamour of the $50 million masterpiece that epitomized the boom years. Instead, these sales reflect the way the auction world used to be 15 years ago: a serious arena for trading art.
1994-10-20	Fine Dining With Many a Golden Touch	"WHEN dining in grand style, nothing can be more intimidating than not knowing when to use a particular piece of silverware. The only thing more daunting is when the silverware is made of gold. 

At a recent luncheon at the trustees' dining room at Sotheby's in Manhattan, 12 guests sat down at a long and sturdy table covered with a white linen cloth and place settings including six solid gold utensils. Soup spoons, each worth $900 in melted metal; dinner forks and knives; butter spreaders; ice-cream spoons, and forks were used during the meal."
1994-09-27	CHRONICLE	"The actor BRONSON PINCHOT has been a serious collector since age 11, when he did chores for neighbors so he could buy first editions of the Oz books and posters of the ""Wizard of Oz"" movie. Fifteen years later, when he became an instant celebrity by starring in the television comedy ""Perfect Strangers,"" his tastes expanded. ""I began to heavily collect original letters and first editions of Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens because I formed an attachment to those two dudes,"" Mr. Pinchot, now 35, said yesterday."
1994-09-18	Farewell to Last Effects Of Effects-Loving Lady	WHEN one has been wed three times (to a film producer-director, another producer and a British merchant banker) and divorced three times, has staked out seven digs in California, New York, Connecticut and England, has loved shopping and collecting and has had tastes ranging from impeccable to whimsical, chances are that one has wound up with an impressive collection of furniture and objets d'art. Nancy Lady Keith was just such a woman, say the pals and adoring acquaintances who knew her as Slim.
1994-09-18	Starry Skies, Wings and Death on the Freeway	"BORN OF FIRE AND MOLTEN metal, the hefty bronze helmets of the ancient Greeks were worn as shimmering symbols of valor and vanity. The Japanese in the 16th century transformed samurai headgear into theatrical surprises. And today, artists on five continents are using the plastic crash helmet of warrior-bikers as a canvas for creativity. Some impressive expressions of the trends in helmet design -- wings, skulls, targets and trash -- can be found in ""Art Is Life,"" an exhibition that originated in Turin, Italy, and features works by 148 artists from 14 countries. After touring automobile museums in Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, the collection was shown in London at Sotheby's, which will auction the helmets in Milan on Oct. 12. Bidding on each helmet will open at $300, but the action will probably not stop there -- especially on the more unusual offerings or those by prominent artists like Carl Andre, Stephen Antonakos, Alex Katz, Mimmo Paladino, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Kenny Scharf and William Wegman."
1994-09-16	Early Lennon Tape Is Sold	"The earliest known recording of John Lennon in performance was sold yesterday at Sotheby's in London for $122,770, the highest price paid at auction for any recording. The recording, of Lennon's first band, the Quarry Men Skiffle Group, on a three-inch reel of tape, was bought by David Hughes, a vice president of Thorn EMI of London. ""This was a unique opportunity to acquire a recording from the day the Beatles were first thought about,"" Mr. Hughes said. ""Paul McCartney turned up that day at the concert, where he met Lennon and tuned his guitar. To us, it's a unique landmark in the history of British music."""
1994-09-16	Inside Art	"A Big Party in SoHo The fall contemporary-art season is getting off to yet another collective start tomorrow with the second annual SoHo Block Party and Performance Art Festival. ""It's three times bigger than last year,"" said Simon Watson, one of the organizers, who is the director of the Contemporary, a nonprofit space on Greene Street. The term block party, however, is a bit misleading. It is, in fact, a neighborhood party. This year 93 museums, nonprofit institutions and galleries, primarily in SoHo, are holding simultaneous openings from 5 to 8 P.M. Participants include Brooke Alexander, Artists Space, the Drawing Center, Fawbush, David Zwirner, the Guggenheim Museum SoHo, the Dia Center for the Arts, Pace Gallery and Sonnabend. In addition, performance art may be seen throughout the day at the alternative space at 45 Greene Street. Changes in the Neighborhood Those strolling SoHo tomorrow will notice changes over the summer. For starters, two galleries have moved into 40 Wooster Street, across from the Drawing Center. After five years at 594 Broadway, Michael Klein has moved to 40 Wooster Street's ground floor. ""We outgrew the space,"" Mr. Klein said."
1994-09-09	Inside Art	"Historical Society to Sell G. Oliver Koppell, the New York State Attorney General, has finally permitted the New-York Historical Society to sell about $20 million worth of art and objects from its collection. The proceeds are to go toward the museum's endowment, which covers some of its operating costs as well as the care of the society's art collection and library. But the sale, expected to take place at Sotheby's in New York early next year, will proceed in a highly unusual fashion. In an attempt to raise the most money for the financially troubled institution while giving other New York State institutions a break, Sotheby's, the attorney general and the society have come up with what they are calling a ""pre-emption plan,"" whereby New York State museums, libraries and archives will have a right of first refusal to buy items at a discount, but only after the auction. Buyers will be informed before the sale that in fact, they may not be buying at all. If an institution decides it wants a work of art or an object that has been auctioned, that can in effect void the sale of that item to the private bidder."
1994-09-04	Spiffy Gleanings From the Arcade	"WHEN HE WAS GROWING up in the 1930's in East Liverpool, Ohio, James Smith 2d lived a trolley-car ride away from paradise: the Rock Springs amusement park in Chester, W. Va. On family outings there twice a month when he was 6 or 7, he loved riding the Ferris wheel, listening to the oom-pah-pah of the carousel and eating cotton candy. ""As soon as I could sneak away from the adults,"" says Dr. Smith, now a New York plastic surgeon, ""I'd head for the penny arcade."" As a teen-ager, he continued playing the coin-operated baseball and horse-racing games at the local pool hall. ""To my father,"" he recalls, ""that was gambling -- outright sinning. So when I got caught, he read me the riot act."""
1994-08-05	Inside Art	I.B.M.'s Collection The belt-tightening continues at I.B.M. While the company hasn't formally announced it, Tracy O'Neill, an I.B.M. spokeswoman, confirmed this week that Sotheby's would sell at least some of I.B.M.'s extensive collection of North American and Latin American art. The auction house declined to comment. The reason the news has been kept so quiet is that I.B.M. hasn't decided if it will sell the entire collection, which experts estimate could be worth $40 million to $100 million. The core consists of about a dozen masterworks by such American artists as Edward Hopper, Childe Hassam, Winslow Homer and George Bellows. I.B.M. has strong Latin American holdings, including paintings by Rufino Tamayo, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.
1994-07-31	SUNDAY, July 31, 1994;Gold Plates	The plates, forks and spoons in the 18 place settings of 18-carat gold belong neither to Donald Trump nor Michael Milken. These vanities come from the family vaults of E. H. Gary, a founder of U.S. Steel and a titan of the Gilded Age. The service, not gilded but gold, was designed by Tiffany & Co. around 1920, in another era when there was no distinction between wealth and taste. Sotheby's is auctioning the set this fall and expects the 557 pieces to sell for more than $1 million. The goldware is supposed to have been used only once, at a banquet for the Sultan of Turkey. Tiny scratches on the dinner plates are a record of that meal.
1994-07-21	John Lennon's First Known Recording Is for Sale	"A previously unknown tape of John Lennon's first band, the Quarry Men Skiffle Group, recorded moments after Lennon met Paul McCartney, has come to light in England after being stored in a vault for decades. The three-inch reel includes Lennon's performances of two songs at St. Peter's Church in Woolton, the Liverpool suburb where he lived, on July 6, 1957. It is the earliest known recording of Lennon, who was 16 at the time. The tape is to be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on Sept. 15. Sotheby's expects it to bring $155,000 to $230,000. The tape was recorded on a portable Grundig TK8 (the machine is included in the sale) by Bob Molyneux, a member of the church's youth club who is now a retired policeman. In 1963, he offered the tape to Lennon, through Ringo Starr. But Lennon never responded, so Mr. Molyneux put the tape in a vault. When he offered it to Sotheby's two months ago, the auction house asked Mark Lewisohn, a Beatles expert who wrote about the performance in ""The Complete Beatles Chronicle,"" to listen to the recording."
1994-07-10	Tiny Trifles That Loom Large With Collectors	A CHAIR AS SMALL AS A THIMBLE, a highboy a mere yard high or a Chihuahua-size bed may look silly individually, but a crowd of these Lilliputian delights makes it clear why some collectors pursue them so obsessively. Tiny trifles, like a hunt table four inches high or a 17-inch-tall Windsor chair, may trigger a rocket back to childhood for unsuspecting adults. And, once seduced into buying a mini-chest, a mini-chair or a mini-desk, people tend to treat these adult toys like sculpture, displaying them on shelves or as end tables. No one ever admits it, but most people yearn at one time or another to live in a doll house.
1994-07-08	Inside Art	Historical Society Chooses Sotheby's If G. Oliver Koppell, the New York State Attorney General, gives his approval, the New-York Historical Society will sell $20 million worth of art and objects from its collection. Miner H. Warner, the society's chairman, said the income from the proceeds would go toward the museum's endowment, which covers some of its operating costs as well as the care of the society's art holdings and library.
1994-07-02	London Art Auctions: No Gaps	"The art world's most visible dealers and collectors were in London this week for the June auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. Some came to bid, others to buy in the public forum of Christie's and Sotheby's salesrooms. Still others, knowing that many of the world's top collectors would be on hand, could be spotted quietly doing business in hotel lobbies, restaurants and in the back rooms of galleries. But the majority came simply out of curiosity, to see whether the sales, which ended on Thursday, would fare better than those in New York just six weeks ago, which were disappointing to many. The results here were mixed. Unlike the reaction at the New York sales, no gasps of horror were heard when works by top artists failed to sell, let alone elicit a bid. If many dealers and collectors came prepared for the worst, by today they were talking about the packed salesrooms and the protracted bidding wars for the most desirable works of art. ""Looking at the week as a whole it appears this round of auctions were generally stronger than the sales in New York, which I consider a positive sign,"" said Barbara Mathes, a New York dealer."

But this week they were up for sale, on auction at Sotheby's here, the walnut 17th-century armoires, the paintings in the French and Flemish style, the Oriental carpets. They once graced the rooms of the powerful Ferruzzi family, the founders of a business empire built on farming and the foodstuffs trade, chemicals, insurance and a hundred other things.
1994-06-04	CHRONICLE	"The title of the ""Conversation"" scheduled to take place at Sotheby's Monday is ""Cultural Thieves,"" which, to put it politely, means how artists reflect one another's work. Less politely it might be described as how you learn by borrowing. The artist LARRY RIVERS, who has been somewhat influenced by the old masters, and LUKAS FOSS, the composer and conductor, who has been somewhat influenced by the baroque composers, will take part in the evening with CHARLES MICHENER, an editor and writer, acting as host.

1994-05-13	More Downs Than Ups at Spring Art Auctions	Nothing has underscored the art market's fragility better than the auctions of contemporary, Impressionist and modern art over the last two weeks in New York. Six months ago, auction-house experts said they felt confident that the market was making a slow but steady climb up the track. Then came an unexpected derailment. Several forces worked against both Sotheby's and Christie's. The world economic outlook has worsened in the last few months, meaning that buyers from Latin America and Asia, on whom the auction houses were counting, disappeared; American collectors led the buying. Other buyers, even if their piggy banks were full, apparently didn't feel psychologically confident enough to spend money this spring, always a factor in the auction room.
1994-05-12	A Klimt Outshines A Monet At Auction	"The state of the market for Impressionist and modern art looked better at Sotheby's last night -- but not that much better. One painting in particular, Klimt's ""Lady With a Fan"" (circa 1917-18), sold for a whopping $11.6 million, far exceeding its estimate of $7 to $9 million. But the sale was not without big disappointments for the sellers. Two of the evening's presumed stars, a Monet and a Brancusi, each expected to bring over more than $7 million, failed to sell at all."
1994-05-06	Inside Art	The Tate Across the Thames What was once called the Temple of Power will now become the Temple of Art. That, at least, is what the Tate Gallery in London hopes will happen when it completes a $120 million transformation of the Bankside Power Station into the Tate Gallery of Modern Art. The Tate's choice of that site for its new museum, announced last week, ended a four-year search. The gallery will be the city's first new international museum since the 19th century. The 100,000-square-foot building on the South Bank of the Thames, just opposite St. Paul's Cathedral, has been empty for 13 years. It was built in two phases, from 1948 to 1963, by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect who designed London's red telephone booths. The Tate plans to buy the building and eight and a half acres surrounding it from Nuclear Electric, using public and private financing, possibly including money generated by the National Lottery. The Tate plans to build a bridge across the Thames connecting St. Paul's to the South Bank and a pier at the Tate at Millbank so that boats can run between the two museums.
1994-05-05	Cracks Still Deep in Contemporary-Art Market	"The cracks are still running deep in the contemporary-art market. Last night, Sotheby's sale took its audience on an unexpected roller-coaster ride, with great highs and plunging lows. There was even a moment of horror when the promised star of the night, Jasper Johns's ""Highway"" (1959), a colorful abstract painting from one of this artist's most desirable periods, failed to sell. This undermined the confidence of the rest of the evening. Bidding stopped for ""Highway"" at $7.2 million, under Sotheby's optimistic estimate of $8 million. The painting was being sold by Peter Brant, the newsprint manufacturer and owner of Interview magazine. An Owner's Lack of Success After the auction, experts said they thought it had not sold because Mr. Brant had been unsuccessfully offering it around himself with a $6 million price tag."
1994-05-01	Wages of Treason: Detritus of a Traitor to Be Sold	There's a faded homburg hat and a silver cocktail shaker, a battered cigarette box and piles of books and papers -- citations from Soviet intelligence officials, an exchange of correspondence with a young field agent under cover in London, even the typed draft of a speech delivered inside K.G.B. headquarters 17 years ago. Gathered for cataloguing inside Sotheby's here, these are the surviving personal effects of Harold Adrian Russell (Kim) Philby, arguably Britain's most infamous traitor. As a high-ranking British intelligence officer, he spent the better part of two decades passing the West's most closely held secrets to the K.G.B, before fleeing to Moscow in 1963 just as he was about to be uncovered.
1994-04-29	Are Happy Days Here Again? Art World Prepares for a Test	ARTISTS may moan that theirs is a lonely profession. But the people who make the international art world move -- the dealers, collectors and auction-house experts -- tend to travel in packs. And their destination, for the next two weeks anyway, is New York City. Art shows are happening all over Manhattan during this period, at conventional spots like galleries and the Seventh Regiment Armory and at more offbeat sites like a ship terminal and a hotel off Gramercy Park. Each show has been timed to coincide with the spring sales of contemporary, Impressionist and modern art that start at Christie's and Sotheby's on Tuesday evening. (The public viewings of the art that will be auctioned begin this weekend at the two houses.)
1994-04-17	The Cherrys' Trove: Will Ethics Also Be on the Block?	"THE FIVE-WEEK EXHIBITION OF the Wendell and Dorothy Cherry collection ends today at the J. B. Speed Museum in Louisville, Ky. -- and the next move part of the collection makes is raising the hackles of some art world ethicists. Nearly half of the 88 Old Master, Impressionist, Austrian Expressionist and American paintings and the palace-quality French and English antiques will be shipped to Sotheby's in New York to be auctioned next month. Sotheby's estimates that the sale could reap as much as $27 million, with four works accounting for half the total: Gustav Klimt's ""Lady With a Fan,"" John Singer Sargent's ""Spanish Dancer"" and two lavishly inlaid pieces of French 18th-century furniture -- a desk by Andre Charles Boulle and a commode by a cabinetmaker to Louis XVI."
1994-04-15	Inside Art	"A Matisse No More Some fakes can fool even the most seasoned experts. Sotheby's had a surprise recently when it began researching paintings from the estate of the New York collector Harriet Weiner Goodstein, which the auction house is selling next month. ""Woman in an Interior,"" a 1943 still life of a woman in an ornately patterned room, had been attributed to Matisse ever since Mrs. Goodstein and her first husband, Leon Mnuchin, bought the painting in 1956 with Eugene V. Thaw acting as the agent."
1994-04-08	Inside Art	Related by Money A bit of nail biting is going on behind the scenes at art galleries and auction houses. Will the recent volatility in the financial markets and uncertainty about interest rates hurt the big New York auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art that are less than a month away? The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed yesterday at close to what it was during the week of the Impressionist and modern art sales in November. But financial experts say the mood now is different than it was then: a lot of the optimism has evaporated.
1994-04-01	CHRONICLE	"Put together E. L. DOCTOROW, ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER JR. and JOHN CHANCELLOR, and what do you have? Quite possibly, even probably, an interesting trialogue -- or at least that's the devout hope of INGER McCABE ELLIOTT. In March, Mrs. Elliott inaugurated ""Conversations at Sotheby's,"" a monthly series exploring the creative process in areas ranging from politics and music to art and history, and, as she put it, to ""juxtapose interesting ideas and interesting people."" Mrs. Elliott, an author and a consultant to Sotheby's, conceived the series to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the auction house."
1994-03-28	CHRONICLE	"ROBERT C. WOOLLEY, Sotheby's senior auctioneer, conducts three or four dozen charity auctions a year. ""I almost do as many for charity as I do for business,"" he said as he prepared the exhibition for tonight's fund-raising auction at Sotheby's, on York Avenue, for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. So what could possibly make tonight's sale distinctive?"
1994-03-25	Inside Art	"The Lineup for Spring Both Sotheby's and Christie's have just sealed deals on important property for their auctions of Impressionist and modern art in New York in May. And not a moment too soon, since their catalogues are due at the printers this week. On May 11, Sotheby's is to offer 12 paintings that belonged to Irving (Swifty) and Mary Lazar. Mr. Lazar, the celebrated literary and entertainment agent who lived in Los Angeles, died in December; Mrs. Lazar died in January 1993. The auction house estimates that their 12 paintings will bring a total of $1.8 million to $2.5 million. Among them are Paul Delvaux's ""Dream (The Garret),"" a 1944 image of the artist asleep in his attic studio, worth an estimated $800,000 to $1 million, and Kees van Dongen's ""Egyptienne-Hamida"" (1913), a portrait of an Egyptian woman, expected to fetch $400,000 to $600,000. Other works in the group are by Raoul Dufy, Edouard Vuillard and the German Expressionist Georg Tappert."
1994-03-11	Inside Art	A Landmark's Changing Face The Guggenheim Museum's name game, which has both amused and horrified the art world, has a new participant: the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The commission's involvement is not by invitation, however. Because the museum is a designated landmark, the museum needs the commission's approval of its plan to place the names of large donors like Samuel J. and Ethel LeFrak on the exterior of the original Frank Lloyd Wright building and the new tower.
1994-02-18	Inside Art	"Spring Offerings As the race heats up to secure hot property for the big May auctions in New York, Sotheby's and Christie's are beginning to announce the estates they have secured. Last week, Sotheby's said it would sell the modern and contemporary artworks that belonged to H. Gates LLoyd, a former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and his wife, Eleanor, who founded the Washington Gallery of Modern Art. This week, Christie's countered, announcing it would auction seven works from what it would characterize only as a ""European estate."" The paintings, by Gauguin, Picasso, Braque, Leger, Cezanne and Vlaminck, are expected to bring more than $15 million."
1994-02-13	THE TALES A TABLE COULD TELL	"In ""The Tales a Table Could Tell,"" by Thatcher Freund (Jan. 16), one factor in the $1 million sale stands out. There was only one real bidder at Sotheby's for the card table. Bidding by phone, he might not have known his only competition was the house."
1994-02-11	Inside Art	Not-So-New From Saatchi When at first Charles Saatchi didn't succeed, he might have taken the hint. But once is not enough for the London-based advertising magnate: he keeps trying, again and again. For three years, ever since his agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, began reporting serious financial losses, Mr. Saatchi has been among Sotheby's biggest consignors.
1994-02-04	Inside Art	"Americana the Beautiful Sotheby's braced itself for a wild weekend. In preparation for the sale of American folk art from the Bertram K. and Nina Fletcher Little collection on Saturday in New York, the auction house arranged its main salesroom with nearly as many chairs and telephones as are on hand for the important evening Impressionist, modern and contemporary art sales. It was a first for a decorative arts auction, but the planning paid off. Every seat was taken and the standing-room crowd spilled out of the room. ""We knew it was going to be big,"" said Nancy Druckman, who heads Sotheby's American folk art department. ""But we didn't know it was going to be that big."" Sotheby's held seven different sessions over a four-day period and the furniture, paintings, folk art, decorative objects and prints brought in a hefty $14.3 million, well above the $8 million to $11.9 million pre-sale estimate. The weekend before, Christie's held a series of Americana auctions in New York, too. Though its sales were smaller and the offerings not quite as impressive, they totaled $5.4 million, just above Christie's low estimate of $5.3 million. At both auction houses it was the private collections that sold the best. ""For the first time in years we saw new buyers who previously hadn't bid in Americana sales,"" said Leslie Keno, director of American furniture at Sotheby's."
1994-02-01	Folk-Art Auction Approaches Fine-Art Prices	The quirky ancestor portraits, weather vanes, embroideries and ship's mastheads that made up the widely exhibited folk art collection of Bertram K. and Nina Fletcher Little brought a total of $7.4 million on Saturday at Sotheby's in Manhattan. The figure, twice what Sotheby's expected, set a record for a folk-art auction as collectors, curators, scholars and dealers turned out in force for the sale. Described by many at the auction as a watershed for folk art, the prices paid may well set the levels for future auctions in this area. At least four museums and historical societies made purchases from the collection, assembled over a half-century by the Boston-area couple, both of whom died last year in their 90's.
1993-12-24	Inside Art	"Good Marks for the Year Sotheby's and Christie's are ending 1993 on a positive note. Both companies released their year-end sales figures this week and business is up from last year. Sotheby's reported sales of $1.32 billion, a 17 percent increase from last year's total of $1.13 billion. Christie's sales totaled $1.09 billion this year, a 3 percent increase from last year's $1.06 billion. ""The art market has turned a corner,"" said David Tyler, Christie's finance director. ""Certainly these figures give us grounds for optimism in 1994."" Both auction houses reported a surprising increase in jewelry sales, as well as steady improvement in sales of Impressionist and modern paintings. This year's top-selling painting was Cezanne's ""Still Life With Apples,"" from 1890-94, which sold on May 11 at Sotheby's in New York for $28.6 million. Appraising the Situation Christie's has been in the hot seat recently. In Manhattan Surrogate's Court, the auction house has had to defend the appraisals it did for the Andy Warhol estate and its main beneficiary, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Outside the courtroom, but nonetheless an offshoot of the Warhol trial, Christie's has found itself in the uncomfortable position of having to explain the appraisal it did for the photographer Robert Mapplethrope's estate. And a recent affidavit from a former Christie's employee has further muddied the waters."
1993-12-12	Space Artifacts of Soviets Soar at a $7 Million Auction	"In what may have been history's most audacious sale of a used vehicle, Sotheby's yesterday auctioned off a research vehicle the Russians left on the surface of the moon in 1970. The price was $68,500. ""We made sure we didn't promise to deliver it,"" said David N. Redden, the senior vice president of the auction house who organized the sale over a three-year period."
1993-12-05	Soviet Space Papers Going on Sale	An auction next month of the more prized technological remains of the Soviet Union will include once-secret notebooks and diaries of space officials that historians say should provide insights into early Soviet successes and failures on the new space frontier. In another reverberation of the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the cold war, the documents are among dozens of artifacts being offered for sale by former Russian officials, engineers and astronauts and also by financially pressed government agencies. The sale is being held on Dec. 11 at Sotheby's, the international auction house, in Manhattan.

1993-11-12	Cautious Optimism as Fall Art Auctions End	"As the two most important weeks of the fall art auctions in New York ended on Wednesday night, it wasn't high prices but a new infusion of energy that stunned the art world. Not since the heady years of the 1980's had there been so much enthusiasm and so many determined bidders. But these buyers weren't going crazy and paying ridiculously high prices. Indeed, the last two weeks have been less about conspicuous consumption and more about a sense of renewed confidence. ""It's fashionable to buy art again,"" said Diana D. Brooks, who heads Sotheby's auctions worldwide. ""We've turned an important corner this fall. After a difficult few years when people were scared away, they now feel good about buying art again."" She cited lower interest rates and strength on Wall Street as having helped make the difference."
1993-11-11	Records Set for 8 Artists as Auction Fever Returns	"The collectors and dealers at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art last night went to shop. And a determined group they were. As at Christie's on Tuesday night, even insignificant artworks sold, and sold well. But last night, prices often soared to more than double the estimates, setting records for eight artists. ""There has been an injection of money and confidence in the market,"" said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, Sotheby's director of contemporary art worldwide. ""What has shifted this fall is the volume of bidders and the fact that there was buying at every level."""
1993-11-06	88 Picassos Sold at Auction, Some Far Beyond Estimates	Sotheby's has always been a company known for taking risks, and its sale of 88 Picassos from the Stanley J. Seeger collection on Thursday night was a risk well taken. Every lot sold, with some works bringing double their estimates. One drawing brought five times as much as expected. This was Sotheby's at its marketing best. As soon as the auction house announced the sale in late September, the works were sent on tour to prospective collectors and dealers in major art capitals around the world. The efforts paid off. The auction house's viewings in the last week were packed with art lovers, and on Thursday night the salesroom was frenetic as dealers and collectors created bidding wars that made it seem the sale would never end. The auction lasted nearly three hours, with buyers from Zurich, Paris, London, Mexico, Asia and various spots in the United States, fighting hard to make a purchase.

Tonight, amid hay bales and pumpkins at the auction house, Mr. Woolley will give his fourth annual Halloween party, a benefit for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, and he has devised a novel price scale for tickets. Old friends are expected to donate $500; new friends, $250, and acquaintances, $125.
1993-10-29	88 Picassos Lead Fall Auction Parade	IN the next two weeks, the attention of the New York art world shifts away from the galleries and the museums and toward the auction houses during the fall sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. This twice-a-year ritual, some of the best free theater in town, offers a variety of entertainment this season. Among the offerings, which go on view this weekend at the auction houses, are everything from the experimental to revivals, as paintings, sculptures and drawings with estimates totaling more than $207 million appear for the art market's autumn pulse-taking. The usual pre-auction anxiety is evident as collectors, dealers and experts from all over the world flock to Sotheby's and Christie's to see works by artists ranging from Picasso and Renoir to Gorky and Hockney. Just how the market will fare in these economic times is the question everyone is asking. While this fall's auction catalogues are much leaner than those of the boom years in the 1980's, and the atmosphere is noticeably sadder, the experts who put the sales together are also far wiser.
1993-10-24	The Tale of Brutus, Recounted in Gold	OLD coins are like little bits of history. The auction of ancient Greek and Roman coins that Sotheby's is scheduled to hold on Tuesday in Zurich makes this clear. Electrum coins from Lydia at the time of Croesus, more than 2,500 years ago, and 2,400-year-old Sicilian coins will share the block with much younger Roman solidi, from the fifth century A.D.
1993-10-22	Inside Art	"White House Walls Kaki Hockersmith's choice of art for the White House walls is still a state secret. And it will continue to be, White House officials say, until the Little Rock decorator has put every last knickknack in place. Judging from one recent selection, however, it looks as though the paintings will go beyond the traditional and the predictable. This fall, Ms. Hockersmith flew to New York City to visit Lisa de Kooning, who showed Ms. Hockersmith a selection of later works by her father, Willem de Kooning. The decorator selected a lyrical painting from 1983, ""Untitled XXXIX."""
1993-10-14	A Princess Tightens Her High-Fashion Belt	"Two hundred years ago on Oct. 16, Marie-Antoinette was guillotined in Paris. Before and after that anniversary, another German-speaking princess with even more lavish tastes is likely to make $20 million selling off her family trinkets. Sotheby's auction of ""The Thurn und Taxis Princely Collection,"" as the seven-volume boxed catalogue is grandly titled, began today and will continue until Oct. 21. Marie-Antoinette's death is being remembered in Paris by all manner of nostalgic events, among them a newly composed Requiem Mass and a play in which the audience gets to vote on her fate. By and large, to the chagrin of the play's creators, they are choosing exile or death."

That's on top of the startling things they've been doing for the last 28 years. During all those years, the couple -- referred to by some dealers in the antiques trade as ""the Fendelpersons"" -- have been amassing a collection of 19th-century American folk art that most museums would envy. For nearly three decades -- the length of time their lives have been personally, professionally and philosophically enmeshed -- they carted and bartered, bought and sold and were obsessed with American folk art, back when just-plain-folk could still afford it."
1993-09-26	Dietrich: Picking Up the Pieces	Fueled by devotees and a flourishing collectibles market, motion-picture memorabilia rocketed to a new level of international acceptance this month when the city of Berlin bought the Marlene Dietrich collection for $5 million. The purchase, announced 12 days ago, reflects the continuing frenzy over the belongings of superstars like Dietrich, Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon. To Dietrich's fans, every item she owned or touched, no matter how insignificant, took on vital importance, something she realized full well. Prescient about the power of her image from her earliest days as a cabaret performer in Weimar-era Germany, she saved virtually everything relating to her public persona, which, remarkably, was still intact the day she died in May 1992 at the age of 90.

1993-07-16	Inside Art	"Small Museums, Big Plans Two small, but well-known art institutions have just announced ambitious expansion plans. In Long Island City, Queens, the nonprofit P.S. 1 Museum has begun a two-year, $5.7 million renovation of its building, a Romanesque Revival schoolhouse dating from 1892. In Houston, the Menil Collection has begun construction on a 9,000-square-foot building designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, whose adjacent Menil Collection building opened six years ago. The new $3.5 million museum will house works by Cy Twombly and was organized in collaboration with the Dia Center for the Arts in Manhattan (initially established with de Menil money as the Dia Art Foundation), which will also open a space devoted to Mr. Twombly. At P.S. 1, the renovation is, in large part, a necessity. ""The structural integrity of the building has been in question,"" said Anthony Vasconcellos, the deputy director of P.S. 1. ""This is not a luxury. Ceilings have been crumbling around us. There's asbestos that is being removed."""
1993-07-10	High Bidder Reneges on Calculator	The Swiss dealer who set an auction record at Chistie's in London in May with his bid of $11.8 million for a 19th-century German calculator now says he cannot pay for it. The buyer, Edgar Mannheimer, a Zurich dealer in watches and scientific instruments, said yesterday that he was in default because his client, whom he did not identify, had abandoned the deal. The talks ended yesterday, Mr. Mannheimer said, when the client told him he was prepared to buy the calculator for a much lower price of around $300,000, should the auction house now decide to put it up for sale again.
1993-07-02	Inside Art	A Screen's Price Auction houses have always been places for recycling. And often art objects come back on the market in new incarnations. Take a 10-panel screen of silk embroidered with flying geese, ducks and bamboo trees. It originally belonged to Juan Portela, the Manhattan antiques dealer, and was prominently displayed in a corner of the dining room of his Manhattan town house. At least, that's where scores of people saw the screen before a sale of Mr. Portela's furniture and objects at Christie's in New York on Jan. 27. In its catalogue, Christie's described the screen as Chinese and estimated that it would sell for $7,000 to $10,000. The screen sold for $6,050 to Joseph P. Carroll, a New York-based art collector and dealer who specializes in Korean art.
1993-06-25	The Art Market	"Lloyd's Losers' Luck Special to The New York Times LONDON, June 20 -- The talk here is of the auction houses' fierce competition to cash in on the financial losses that have overwhelmed thousands of Lloyd's of London investors who are being forced to sell off sometimes choice property to pay their debts. Among the ""names,"" as these investors are called in England, are members of Parliament and titled families. Sotheby's and Christie's are vying for the salable property belonging to these individuals, who as investors in the three-century-old insurer are personally responsible for its obligations. Lloyd's has been reporting huge losses for the last three years now, and the situation appears to be getting worse. As a result, the insurer's investors must raise cash to make the payouts on insurance policies."
1993-06-19	Spain Paying $350 Million for Baron's Art	After a year of complicated negotiations, the Spanish Government today announced an agreement to buy the prized art collection of the Swiss industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza for $350 million. The collection of 775 paintings from the 13th to the 20th centuries is considered one of the world's greatest private art collections, perhaps surpassed only by that of Queen Elizabeth II. Sotheby's has estimated its value at nearly $2 billion.
1993-06-13	Memorabilia From Out of the Wild Blue Yonder	OTTO KALLIR, A COLLECTOR OF aeronautical material, was not discouraged back in 1907 when, at age 13, a letter he wrote to the Wright brothers went unanswered. Years later, as an art dealer in Manhattan, the Viennese native acquired 50 letters, photographs and documents signed by Wilbur and Orville Wright. Kallir, who founded the Galerie St. Etienne in 1939 and was responsible for discovering Grandma Moses and introducing the paintings of the Austrian Expressionists Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt to the United States, died in 1978. The Wright manuscripts are among 210 flight-related offerings from his estate that will be auctioned tomorrow at Sotheby's in New York. The holdings, which Sotheby's describes as the most comprehensive such collection to go on the block in 25 years, are expected to fetch about $800,000.
1993-06-10	Designs That Set a Standard	THE big names of the era are all there: Charles Eames and Frank Lloyd Wright, Paul Frankl and George Nakashima, Isamu Noguchi and Donald Deskey. These designers set the tone and produced the pieces that put American furniture on the international map in the first half of this century. Today at 2 P.M. at Sotheby's, 1334 York Avenue (at 72d Street), 284 lots of pieces from this period will be put on the auction block as part of a sale of 20th-century decorative arts.
1993-06-06	From the Ancient To the Experimental	THIS week and the next will be busy ones for New York numismatists. Three companies have scheduled auctions, and Sotheby's starts the whirl on Thursday with its auction of United States and foreign coins. The offerings include a Brilliant Proof 1879 Flowing Hair Stella, a $4 gold piece. Stellas are among the rarest of the experimental United States coins, with only about 25 of the original Flowing Hair variety struck. Another 400 were struck later, but to date there is no way to tell the originals from the restrikes.
1993-06-04	The Art Market	"Tale of 2 Cities Many of the late 19th- and early-20th-century masterpieces by such artists as Matisse, Cezanne, van Gogh, Redon and Picasso that are in the Cone Collection, the jewel in the Baltimore Museum of Art's crown since 1949, are traveling to the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. Perfect timing made the loan possible. Originally, the collection was to be dismantled and placed in storage while the Baltimore Museum completed its new $7.5 million west wing. ""While we like to think that everyone will come to Baltimore to see the Cone Collection, we realize it's just not possible,"" said Arnold L. Lehman, the director of the Baltimore Museum. ""Sending it to Houston is a wonderful opportunity to give a wider audience a chance to see the collection."""
1993-06-04	Sotheby's Challenged In Selling Declaration	It is a first printing of the Declaration of Independence -- a clear, crisp copy that sold for $2.4 million two years ago -- and yesterday it became enmeshed in a Manhattan court fight over ownership and resale rights. A fine arts investment firm, Visual Equities Inc., of Atlanta, obtained a court order temporarily blocking Sotheby's from selling the Declaration after charging that the Manhattan auction house had misled the firm and tried to defraud it at an unsuccessful auction last month.
1993-05-28	The Art Market	"Where an Arc Once Ruled The General Services Administration has come up with a new and decidedly politically correct plan for the space surrounding 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan. It involves the American sculptor Beverly Pepper and the Boston landscape architect Martha Schwartz, and the new scheme comes with the neighborhood seal of approval. Four years have passed since the furor over Richard Serra's ""Tilted Arc,"" the monumental steel sculpture that bisected the space in front of 26 Federal Plaza from 1981 to 1989. After a prolonged and heated artistic battle that involved the plaza's tenants and neighborhood residents, the 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long piece was proclaimed by the agency to have rendered the plaza unusable. In 1989 the work was dismantled and removed, an act that the artist said was tantamount to destroying it."
1993-05-14	The Art Market	There's no making sense of this spring's auctions in New York. Even the experts, trying to analyze the sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in the last two weeks, are baffled. Taken as a whole, the sales at Sotheby's and Christie's were a four-night roller-coaster ride on which the highs rose beyond anyone's expectations and the lows hit with a resounding thud. Instead of one solid auction market, this spring's sales, which ended on Wednesday night, showed a market divided. The difference between a weak market for contemporary art and a strong one for Impressionist and modern art was glaringly apparent, what with an utterly disastrous sale of Andy Warhols at Sotheby's one week and a record $28.6 million price for a Cezanne at the same house the next.
1993-05-12	Million-Dollar Bidding Is Back As a Cezanne Sets a Record	"Cezanne's ""Still Life With Apples"" set a staggering record last night when it sold for $28.6 million at Sotheby's auction of Impressionist paintings, drawings and sculptures. The price was $11.5 million more than any Cezanne has brought before. Much to the shock of spectators, dealers and auction-house experts, the sale had moments when it seemed as if the clock had turned back to the boom of the late 1980's, the days of bidding wars and record highs. In contrast, Sotheby's entire evening sale of Impressionist works two years ago totaled only $18 million."
1993-05-05	A Brighter Night for Contemporary Art	Yes, collectors, there is a contemporary-art market. Few would have thought so after Monday night's sale at Sotheby's, but at Christie's last night, quality works sold, and sold relatively well, considering that the market is still trying to inch its way out of a two-year slump. Of the 60 works up for sale, 38 found buyers, for a sale total of $10.6 million. While the sum was less than the auction house's estimate of $13.3 million to $17.8 million, nobody at the Christie's was complaining. After Sotheby's sale on Monday night made only $8.8 million, less than half its estimate of $18.4 million to $24.7 million, experts at Christie's were quietly relieved.
1993-05-04	10 Out of 12 Warhols Go Unsold In First of Big Spring Art Auctions	Sotheby's gambled last night and lost. Prices at its sale of contemporary art, the first in a two-week auction marathon, sank to the levels of 1990-91, when experts proclaimed that the market had hit bottom. The poor sales were something of a surprise, since the market seemed to be slowly turning around last fall. Of the 77 works up for sale last night, only 40 found buyers. Of those that did sell, most went for prices below or at the auction house's low estimates. And not one work reached $1 million.
1993-04-30	Making The Best Of Lean Times At the Auctions	"IF the boom of the late 1980's had never happened, then the offerings wouldn't seem so slim at Sotheby's and Christie's, whose important spring sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art begin next week in Manhattan. But those heady days when catalogues were as thick as telephone books and estimates hit the double-digit millions weren't so long ago. They still haunt the art world. By comparison, the more than $225 million worth of paintings, drawings and sculpture by artists like Monet and Matisse, Warhol and Lichtenstein that are on public view this weekend and go up for sale beginning on Monday night at Sotheby's, seem modest, to say the least. ""It's quite clear both of us have had to struggle to get pictures,"" said Christopher Burge, the president of Christie's in New York. It is also clear that as the art market struggles out of a two-year slump, collectors who don't have to sell would prefer to hold off until prices go up."
1993-04-09	The Art Market	"Whither 12 Warhols? Andy Warhol was an artist who liked to think in multiples. But what might he say if he knew that 12 of his works are being offered for sale at once at Sotheby's in New York on May 3? Ten of the works are from the private collection of Fred W. Hughes, Warhol's business manager for 25 years and now the executor of the Warhol estate and chairman emeritus of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Mr. Hughes has amassed an extraordinary collection of Warhols from the early 1960's, which experts consider the cream of the crop for serious Pop Art collectors. Mr. Hughes said he was selling his Warhols because ""I need the money."""
1993-03-26	The Art Market	A Kunsthalle for NoHo NoHo may never be able to match SoHo's gallery scene, but it is about to get a serious alternative artists' space. Two adjacent landmark buildings, at 210-14 East Fifth Street, the site of Beethoven Hall in the 19th century and more recently the home of Mother's Sound Stages, a film studio, are about to be transformed into the New York Kunsthalle.
1993-02-19	The Art Market	A Collection in Danger The London art world is in an uproar over what may turn into de-accessioning at the highest level. An internal British Treasury Department document that was leaked to the press last week proposed selling off the Government's extraordinary holdings of paintings and furniture. These works of art, which include paintings by artists like Gainsborough, Walter Richard Sickert, Augustus John and Frank Auerbach, adorn British Embassies and Government offices around the world.
1993-02-04	Historical Society To Close Library	The board of the New-York Historical Society voted yesterday to shut down the institution's library on Feb. 19. All public programs are to be canceled, with the exception of a traveling show of 90 Audubon watercolors that had long been planned, and 41 staff members will be dismissed; a skeleton crew of 35 will be left to handle security, conservation and disposition of the collections. Last week the society seemed to have weathered a financial storm by putting up $3 million worth of artworks from its collection to secure a $1.5 million loan from Sotheby's auction house. But board members said yesterday that despite receiving the loan, they had decided to shut the library after a staff report indicated that the extra funds would not sustain even a greatly scaled-down operation for six months, as originally planned.
1993-01-29	The Art Market	Newhouse-Geffen Deal? The principals aren't talking, but word is out that S. I. Newhouse Jr. has sold several paintings to the multi-millionaire producer and investor David Geffen. The deal is said to have been brokered by Mr. Geffen's longtime friend and art dealer, Larry Gagosian (the two are frequently seen at auctions together), and Arne Glimcher, owner of both Pace Galleries in Manhattan.
1993-01-28	The Historical Society Is Criticized for Using Artworks as Collateral	"Many museum professionals have expressed sharp criticism of the New-York Historical Society for using part of its collection as collateral to secure a $1.5 million loan from Sotheby's, an agreement that became known yesterday. But a few expressed the view that the financially troubled institution should be granted some latitude, since its existence as a museum may no longer be viable. Robert Macdonald, the director of the Museum of the City of New York -- which had offered to merge with the historical society last year -- was particularly blunt in his criticism. ""The museum has jeopardized its soul,"" he said. ""Losing a collection like this that relates to the city of New York would be a major tragedy."" Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, spoke guardedly about the matter. ""If the Boston Museum or the Metropolitan Museum of Art did that, it would be condemned,"" he said. ""In the case of the historical society, however, with the likelihood of a substantial change of mission, the collections may no longer be central to its mission, and then you would have to look at this differently."""
1993-01-27	Historical Society Puts Up Artworks As Loan Collateral	"The financially beleaguered New-York Historical Society has put up $3 million worth of artworks from its collection as collateral to secure a $1.5 million commercial loan it says it needs to survive. The loan is from Sotheby's, the world's largest art auction house. The society would not identify the specific artworks it put up as security, but it said it had been planning to sell them anyway. ""We're not selling the farm,"" said Norman Pearlstine, the chairman of the historical society. ""This is an extraordinary good-will gesture to a troubled institution that has been getting very little support from the traditional sources."""
1993-01-08	The Art Market	Mass Moca, Round 2 The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art has been given another chance. Last week, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts agreed to give the museum's Cultural Development Commission a six-month extension to raise $12 million. If it can come up with the money, the Governor said, he will release the $33 million approved by the State Legislature in 1988 to establish the museum in North Adams, Mass. Governor Weld temporarily froze the money after he took office in 1991. So far, the commission has secured pledges of $4.1 million from individuals, corporations and foundations. The project, popularly known as Mass Moca, is billed as the world's largest museum of contemporary art, concentrating on works from the 1960's, 70's and 80's. The ambitious goal is to fill the abandoned Sprague Technologies plant in North Adams, a complex of 28 buildings on 13.5 acres.
1992-12-25	The Art Market	A Word for the Modern Europe may be getting at least one new museum of contemporary art, possibly two. But at this stage, both projects are little more than pipe dreams.
1992-12-23	Christie's, Too, Will Increase Commissions	Seven weeks after Sotheby's increased the commission it charges buyers to 15 percent from 10, its chief rival, Christie's, announced it would follow suit. Beginning March 1, those who buy at Christie's in the United States, Switzerland, Hong Kong or at the King Street salesroom in London will be charged 15 percent on goods sold for $50,000 or less. Sales of higher value will be charged 15 percent on the first $50,000 and 10 percent for the remainder.
1992-12-18	A Lincoln Manuscript Is Sold for $1.5 Million	"The earliest-known draft of Abraham Lincoln's ""house divided"" doctrine opposing slavery was purchased on Wednesday at Sotheby's in New York for $1.5 million, a record at auction for an American autograph and manuscript. The buyers were the New York businessmen Richard Gilder and Lewis E. Lehrman."
1992-12-11	The Art Market	"Warhol Money Troubles On Tuesday, the troubled Andy Warhol Foundation voted Anthony M. Solomon, the former president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank, to be its eighth board member. ""We had been wanting to add someone with a strong business background,"" said Archibald L. Gillies, the president of the foundation."
1992-11-18	A Night to Buy Low at Sotheby's	"Attention, Sotheby's shoppers. Bargains were plentiful at last night's sale of contemporary art. Of the 77 works offered, only 51 found buyers, and many lots went by without a single bid. The sale totaled $21.3 million, well below Sotheby's estimate of $31.5 million to $40 million. Many works by major artists sold for surprisingly low sums. ""I wasn't surprised by the sale,"" said Eli Broad, a Los Angeles collector. ""Clearly there were cases where the estimates were too high."""
1992-11-15	November 8-14; Matisse Prices Raise Art Market's Spirits	"The first of the two-week fall art auctions could easily be characterized as the week of Matisse madness. At Christie's in New York last Wednesday, ""Harmony in Yellow"" (1927-1928) set a world record for the artist, selling for $14.5 million to an unidentified telephone bidder. The price far exceeded Christie's estimate that it would fetch $5 million to $7 million. Another important Matisse also sold for a hefty price. At Sotheby's on Tuesday night, the New York dealer William Acquavella paid $11 million for ""Asia"" (1946). Mr. Acquavella was acting as agent for the Kimbell Museum of Art in Fort Worth, Tex."
1992-11-13	The Art Market	"A Cezanne Moves West The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has just acquired a major work by Cezanne. ""Under the Trees"" is estimated to be worth about $13 million, which would make it the museum's most expensive acquisition. But the painting, done between 1882 and 1894, will not be put on public view until February, when its unveiling will coincide with the opening of two special exhibitions, ""Degas to Matisse: The Maurice Wertheim Collection,"" which opens on Feb. 14 and runs through April 25, and ""The William S. Paley Collection,"" from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which will run from Feb. 25 through May 16."
1992-11-11	Museum in Texas Buys a Matisse for $11 Million	"Last night's sale at Sotheby's of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture was an evening of bottom fishing as bidders tried to see just how low prices would go. Without ""Asia,"" a 1946 Matisse bought for an unexpectedly high $11 million by the New York dealer William Acquavella, who was bidding for the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, the evening could have been a disaster for the auction house. Of the 66 works up for sale, almost half did not find buyers. The evening's total was $35.6 million, far below Sotheby's estimate of $59 million to $80 million, but $8.6 more higher than the equivalent sale last fall. Many works sold for less than their low estimates."
1992-11-06	The Art Market; Auction Houses Await The Upturn	IT has been a tense few months at Christie's and Sotheby's. With the art market struggling to inch its way out of a two-year recession, putting together the fall sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art hasn't been easy. Many sellers are still holding back, hoping that the market will show signs of a recovery, so it is estate property that the auction houses count on most. Until just weeks ago, when the catalogues had to go to press, the two companies were vying for what little hot property was available. While the pickings seem slim, the quality is not. Indeed, the 1,260 works up for sale in the next two weeks include some of the strongest paintings, drawings and sculptures to come on the market since 1990. The works go on public view this weekend at Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan, beginning tomorrow at 10 A.M.
1992-11-03	Sotheby's to Increase Charges Paid by Buyers	A week before the biggest sales of the fall, Sotheby's announced yesterday that it would increase the 10 percent commission it charges purchasers. Beginning on Jan. 1, buyers are to be charged 15 percent on all goods sold for $50,000 or less. Sales of higher value are to be charged 15 percent on the first $50,000 and 10 percent thereafter. The increase was the first change since the commission was initiated, in London in 1975 and in the United States in 1979.
1992-10-30	The Art Market	"A Big Seller The fall auction season's most important painting and sculpture catalogues have arrived, and the game of ""Name That Seller"" begins. So far, the most revealing catalogue is the one for Sotheby's sale of contemporary art on Nov. 17 in Manhattan. Art experts say three works, together worth about $3.5 million, are being sold by A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's chairman. The works include Clyfford Still's ""1947-K,"" which is estimated to bring $1.5 million to $2 million; Franz Kline's ""Elizabeth,"" from 1958, which is expected to fetch $1.75 million to $2 million, and ""Eta,"" painted by Morris Louis in 1961, which is estimated to bring $250,000 to $300,000. Another work, Robert Rauschenberg's ""Press,"" from 1964, once belonged to Mr. Taubman. It was included in the Whitney Museum of American Art's 1990 catalogue for the exhibition called ""Robert Rauschenberg: The Silk-Screen Paintings."""
1992-10-16	The Art Market	A Disney Attack The incident may seem a little Mickey Mouse. But it's Donald Duck, too. And bets are that when Goofy gets wind of it, he'll be growling mad.
1992-10-09	The Art Market	"Matisse or Money The Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pa., with the encouragement of Sotheby's, is proposing to do something considered blasphemous in museum circles. The museum wants to sell its most valuable painting, Matisse's ""Pink Shrimp,"" from 1920, to help cover operating costs. And the Museum of Modern Art's current blockbuster Matisse retrospective may help the Everhart to sell it."
1992-09-25	The Art Market	"There and Back Again Two paintings hanging in the Matisse retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art will disappear for a week in November. The works -- ""Asia"" (1946) and ""The Red Beach"" (1905) -- will make a brief appearance at Sotheby's in New York, where they will be offered for sale at the Nov. 10 auction of Impressionist and modern paintings. After the sale, the buyers will have to wait to take the works home. Both paintings will go back to the Modern for the remainder of the exhibition, through Jan. 12. Sotheby's timing couldn't be better. Prices for the work of a major artist often rise after it is the subject of an important exhibition. And what finer showcase than the splendid Matisse blockbuster? Another reason these works are expected to bring high prices is that great Matisses rarely come up at auction. Most of them are either in museums or tend to stay in private collections."
1992-08-18	Lincoln's 'House Divided' Draft to Be Sold	"The earliest known draft of Abraham Lincoln's ""house divided"" doctrine opposing slavery, written in Lincoln's hand, will be auctioned on Dec. 15 by Sotheby's in New York. Selby Kiefer, a Sotheby's American manuscript specialist, said yesterday that the holograph, in brown ink on a single sheet of paper slightly bigger than 11 by 7 inches, has additional sentences and different wording and punctuation from the published versions of this address, one of the most provocative of Lincoln's career. The autograph is expected to sell for $300,000 to $500,000."
1992-07-31	The Art Market	"Sotheby's vs. Christie's The age-old battle over who has a greater share of the auction market, Sotheby's or Christie's, became particularly ferocious on Wednesday when both companies announced their end-of-season figures. Each auction house reported that despite a decline in earnings from last year, the market is in a slow recovery. But Christie's, it appears, included so-called private treaty sales -- in which the auction house finds a buyer without putting an artwork on the block -- in its season totals, something it has never done before. And Sotheby's did not. As a result, Christie's is proclaiming a gain in its market share. Sotheby's, on the other hand, is accusing Christie's of distorting its figures and trying to manipulate the market. ""By combining private treaty sales and auction sales and comparing them to our numbers, which do not include private treaty sales, Christie's is comparing apples and oranges,"" said Michael Ainslie, the president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of the auction house. ""We think what they have done is very inappropriate."""
1992-07-24	The Art Market	"Wishing and Hoping Just how permanent is the Guggenheim Museum's permanent collection? It's a question many art-world insiders are asking, now that all the extensive publicity and glittering parties surrounding the museum's recent reopening are over. While the need to expand the space available to display the large permanent collection was the reason most often cited for the museum's $45 million renovation and expansion, the first exhibition in the new galleries, ""Masterpieces From the Guggenheim Collection,"" includes many works that the museum does not, in fact, own, and a few that it probably never will. A number of wall labels read: ""On Extended Loan."""
1992-07-10	The Art Market	"A Rembrandt Leads The priciest painting in this summer's round of Impressionist, modern, contemporary and Old Master sales in London may be Rembrandt's ""Portrait of Johannes Uytten bogaert,"" which was sold at Sotheby's on Wednesday for $7.94 million to Alfred Bader, a collector from Milwaukee. That an Old Master painting fetched significantly more than any Impressionist work is not surprising these days. In fact, compared with Canaletto's ""Old Horse Guards, London, From St. James's Park,"" which was sold at Christie's in April to the composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for $17.7 million, and Titian's ""Venus and Adonis,"" which fetched $13.4 million at Christie's in London in December, the sum is quite small. Nonetheless, it exceeded Sotheby's $5 million estimate. ""We were very happy,"" said Julian Stock, who heads Sotheby's Old Masters department in London. The painting belonged to the Earl of Rosebery, whose family had owned it since the 1860's."
1992-06-28	The Case of the Silver Treasure	"In the ridiculously intricate backwaters of British snobbery, a marquess ranks immediately behind a duke and ahead of a count. It is an ancient title, created in the 15th century, that originally referred to a nobleman who ruled over frontier lands, or marches.

But there is precious little that is either snobbish or ancient about Spencer Douglas David Compton, Marquess of Northampton. Lord Northampton -- Spenny to his friends -- is a 46-year-old dandy known throughout Britain for being rich and eccentric. He owns not one but two stately homes -- Compton Wynyates, a Tudor pile near Stratford-Upon-Avon, and Castle Ashby, an Elizabethan mansion in (where else) Northamptonshire. Despite the country homes, the marquess doesn't shoot, regarding the traditional pastime of his class as uncivilized."
1992-05-29	The Art Market	"New Home for 'Guernica' The board of directors of the Prado in Madrid voted last week to allow Pablo Picasso's ""Guernica,"" now displayed within a huge bulletproof case in an annex of the museum, to move several blocks away to the Reina Sofia Art Center, Spain's national museum of contemporary art. The Reina Sofia is also getting other works from the Prado, including Picasso's drawings for ""Guernica,"" several Cubist works by both Picasso and Juan Gris (the bequest of the collector Douglas Cooper) and two Joan Miro paintings from the artist's family. ""It's a reorganization of the collection,"" said Maria de Corral, the director of the Reina Sofia. ""As the national museum of contemporary art, we are getting 20th-century works from the Prado, and in exchange the Prado will be getting some 19th-century art from us."""
1992-05-28	Sotheby's Tries to Leave oman-Silver Dispute	Sotheby's in New York filed a motion yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan requesting that it be dismissed from a two-year-old suit over 14 pieces of ancient Roman silver called the Sevso treasure. After Sotheby's announced it would sell the treasure for its British owner, Lord Northampton, in February 1990, the Governments of Lebanon and Yugoslavia claimed title to the silver and obtained a preliminary injunction barring its removal from the United States for sale in Switzerland. Since then, the Government of Hungary has also filed a title claim for the silver, which is being held by Sotheby's pending settlement of the case.
1992-05-22	Auction Record Set in Decorative Arts	"French furniture and European silver from the collection of Jaime Ortiz-Patino, an heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, were auctioned Wednesday and yesterday for a total of $23.7 million. The sale at Sotheby's in New York established a record for any decorative arts auction. The collection, bought over the last 25 years to furnish his home in Geneva, was sold by Mr. Ortiz-Patino after he was refused permission to build a golf course on his property and sold his home there. ""He wants to spend more time at his London flat and at his home in Sotogrande, Spain, where a Masters tournament is held,"" said Ian Irving, a Sotheby's silver specialist."
1992-05-17	The Enchantment of Design on Design	The French Cabinets and English punch bowls up for sale this week from the collection of Jaime Ortiz-Patino are the most pictorial furnishings to be auctioned in memory. Emblazoned on the 18th-century furniture are Japanese lacquered landscapes, floral still lifes and hunting scenes, while the 17th-century silver is exquisitely engraved with Chinese gardens, scholars in quirky caps and a jockey racing his horse. Mr. Ortiz-Patino's delight in decorated surfaces is seen throughout his collection of 170 furnishings and Old Master paintings, all of which are for sale at Sotheby's in New York from Wednesday to Friday. The auction is estimated to total $23 million to $32 million. Bought over the last 25 years to furnish his home in Geneva, the collection is being sold because Mr. Ortiz-Patino, an heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, no longer lives in Switzerland.
1992-05-15	The Art Market	"The two most important weeks of the spring auctions in New York ended on Wednesday night, and the mood was one of great relief. Given the current economy, things could have been worse -- much worse. After the slump of the last 18 months, the market for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art -- the bread and butter of both Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's largest auction houses -- began inching its way back to life. While total sales were less than the auction houses' estimates, the number of new bidders and the enthusiasm in the salesrooms showed a marked change since the November sales. ""It came as almost a shock,"" said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York. ""But the message is clear: it's still a delicate market. Buyers are looking hard at estimates. And people must not be too optimistic about prices' rising in the near future. The same low figures must continue."""
1992-05-14	Another Spirited Auction Brings $33.8 Million	"The two-week spring round of evening auctions ended on a high note at Sotheby's last night in a two-and-a-half-hour sale of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture. The sale totaled $33.8 million, less than the auction house's pre-sale estimate of $39 million to $54 million. Of the 93 works up for sale, 79 were sold. ""We're very pleased; we've really rounded a corner,"" said Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's president. ""Thank you, American collectors."" Of the seven most expensive works up for sale, four were bought by Americans, one by a South American collector, one by an Asian dealer and one by a European dealer."
1992-05-10	All About/Art Sales; The Market's Blue Period	The art market is still in the doldrums, judging from the results of last week's evening sales of contemporary art in New York at Christie's and Sotheby's, the world's largest auction houses. Sales next week of Impressionist and modern art will either confirm or confound that trend. Just $23.5 million worth of contemporary art was sold, well below the pre-sale estimates of about $35 million.
1992-05-08	Despite Sales, a Glum Spirit At Sotheby's Art Auction	The atmosphere at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art on Wednesday night was surprisingly gloomy, compared with the buoyant feeling at the auction at Christie's on Tuesday night. The sale at Sotheby's totaled $12.3 million, which was below the auction house's estimate of $17.6 million to $23.3 million. It was, in fact, a higher total than at Christie's, which came to $11.2 million. Of the 61 works offered for sale at Sotheby's, 40 sold. At Christie's on Tuesday night, 51 of 70 works sold. At both auctions, private collectors dominated the buying, eagerly snapping up works that went at relatively bargain prices.

At both auctions, private collectors dominated the buying, eagerly snapping up works that went at relatively bargain prices.
1992-05-01	The Art Market; Auction Houses Cutting Prices To Lure Buyers	TO judge this spring's contemporary-art auctions by their catalogue's covers, literally, is to conclude that times are good. And they are, for buyers. But for sellers and auction houses, the story is not so rosy. Debt, death and divorce, the three D's of the auction business, keep the art market going. And the adage will be underscored by this season's two weeks of auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York, which begin on Tuesday. And starting this weekend, the works to be sold, over 3,000 paintings, drawings and sculptures by such artists as Picasso and Polke, Renoir and Warhol, valued at more than $325 million, will go on public view at the two houses.
1992-04-12	Are Cartoon Stills Still a Hot Ticket?	"During the art boom of the 1980's, Herbert Black, a Montreal industrialist, paid record prices at auction for Impressionist art, Chippendale furniture, a John Lennon guitar and Walt Disney celluloids, known as cels. In the more sober 1990's, Mr. Black is hanging on to Renoir's ""Little Gypsy Girl,"" which he bought for $1.8 million in 1980, then the record for an Impressionist painting. And his collection of 18th-century English antiques is intact. But the Lennon guitar, for which he paid $19,800 in 1984, is gone, raffled to benefit a charity. And he is selling the part of his holdings -- Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Snow White cels -- that so far has remained recession-proof."
1992-03-23	Sotheby's and Museum in Dispute Over a Painting With a Murky Past	"A painting believed by some to have been stolen from a German museum by a Soviet soldier during World War II is to be auctioned by Sotheby's in London on April 1 despite its questionable provenance. The forthcoming sale has stirred considerable outrage among art dealers, art historians and auction-house experts. Many of them believe that the 17th-century painting, ""The Holy Family With Saints John and Elizabeth and Angels,"" by the Dutch Mannerist Joachim Wtewael, should be returned to the Schlossmuseum, a small museum in a castle in Gotha, in central Germany, where it hung before World War II. But Sotheby's displays the painting prominently on the cover of its catalogue for the auction and maintains that it is free to sell it. The auction house contends that the painting was never stolen, but rather was given as a gift to a Soviet officer during the war."
1992-03-20	The Art Market	To the Victor a Millet Just how far will Sotheby's outdo Christie's to get a plum? Even when times were good, the struggle between the two top auction houses, sometimes for a single picture, was fierce. But with the spring sales in New York only two months away, obtaining great works of art appears to require a good deal of ingenuity.
1992-03-01	You'll Flip	A rare Honus Wagner baseball card sold yesterday for $220,000 at an auction of sports memorabilia at Sotheby's in Manhattan. The winning bidder was RON OSER, an executive with Sports Heroes, a sports-memorabilia company based in Philadelphia and Oradell, N.J. Last year, WAYNE GRETZKY and Los Angeles Kings owner BRUCE McNALL together paid $451,000 for a Wagner card. Only about 40 Wagner cards are known to exist. (AP)
1992-02-13	Yesteryear's Whatnots Set Auction Records	"COLLECTORS of the rarest baseball cards, film posters, comic books, Georgian silver and Art Deco clocks had good reason to cheer last year every time such items soared to record levels at auction, defying a downward trend in prices for fine art and antiques. ""Nostalgia fuels these collectibles sales,"" said Joshua Arfer, director of Christie's New York sales of toys and entertainment items.

1992-01-24	The Art Market	"Old Masters' Strength The Old Masters dealers are feeling smug after the results of last week's New York auctions. Indeed, their market is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy season. ""It's our turn to have a day in the sun,"" said Ian Kennedy, the director of Old Masters collections at Christie's. ""Old Masters are one of the only markets that haven't gone crazy and therefore haven't collapsed."""
1992-01-17	The Art Market	"Paintings by Australians Behind-the-scenes maneuvering for major works of art has always been a way of life for auction houses and dealers. But in this bleak season, when so few good collections are up for grabs, the competition is especially heated. This week, three plum collections -- one of a celebrated collector, featuring works by Australian artists, another of Old Master paintings and decorative objects, and a third comprised of contemporary art -- have caused quite a scramble. By far the juiciest is the group of paintings and sculptures belonging to Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian industrialist who became a famous figure in the art world five years ago when he borrowed $27 million from Sotheby's to buy van Gogh's ""Irises"" for $53.9 million, at that point the largest amount ever paid for a painting. (The painting has since been bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.)"
1991-12-19	Holy Record Breaker! $55,000 for First Batman Comic	The superhero at Sotheby's first auction of comic books yesterday was Harold M. Anderson, the owner of a traveling museum of baseball memorabilia based in Florence, Ala. Mr. Anderson bought many of the most important properties and paid a record price at auction for a comic book with his $55,000 purchase of a copy of Detective 27, the 1939 issue in which Batman appeared for the first time.
1991-12-13	Memorabilia Fail to Sell	One of the largest collections of Presidential material in private hands went unsold yesterday at Sotheby's in New York at its first auction of such collectibles. Assembled in the 1970's by Paul Perlin, a Chicago wheat trader, the 20,000 buttons, banners, posters and autographs span the period from George Washington to Jimmy Carter. They were offered as one lot that was estimated by Sotheby's to bring $2.5 million to $3.5 million. No bids were visible at the sale, which ended in less than two minutes.
1991-12-07	From Sotheby's High Gloss To Filth of Calcutta's Slums	"The auctioneer cut an imposing figure, nearly six feet tall in heels, her English-accented contralto crisply authoritative. ""We're going to dash right in and start,"" she announced Wednesday evening. In less than an hour she would sell Keith Carradine's lucky cowboy boots, Dorothy Hamill's favorite skates, Nolan Ryan's no-hit cleats, Ivana Trump's mules and the used footwear of more than a dozen other famous people as part of a benefit staged by the Fashion Footwear Association to help AIDS patients."
1991-12-07	Decorative Arts Sale Defies Auction Slump	"The sale of French furniture and decorative objects from the Keck collection on Thursday night at Sotheby's proved that in this depressed auction season a touch of gilt and lacquer goes a long way. Many pieces sold for more than their high estimates, a far cry from the disappointing results in last month's auctions of paintings, drawings and sculpture. Of the 55 objects on the block on Thursday, only six failed to sell. The auction's total, $10,212,400, confirmed what the art market already knew: fine French furniture appears to be recession-proof. ""It just doesn't fall,"" Jean-Marie Rossi, a Paris-based dealer, said after the sale. ""This is still a serious market."" And that was exactly what Sotheby's was banking on. With the auction house's bread and butter -- Impressionist, modern and contemporary paintings -- bringing in far less revenue, it is counting on the decorative arts to make up much of the difference."
1991-12-06	The Art Market	Mystery Cabinets Almost as quickly as Sotheby's issued the catalogue of its Dec. 13 London sale of French and Continental furniture and tapestries, tongues began wagging. One of the sale's star offerings -- a pair of Louis XIV ebony cabinets decorated with Boulle ormolu marquetry -- looked awfully familiar. Experts in the rarefied world of fine French furniture believed the cabinets had been among the most prized pieces in the celebrated Patino Collection. Sotheby's sold this collection of furniture and decorative objects, which had belonged to Antenor Patino, the Bolivian tin magnate, to an unnamed buyer on Nov. 1, 1986, for $797,500.
1991-11-24	1992 Prediction: A Landslide of Presidential Memorabilia	"Who was Charles J. Guiteau, and why did hundreds of people pay $1 for prints of a photograph he took of himself in 1881? ""Charles Guiteau assassinated President Garfield,"" explained Paul Perlin, a Chicago wheat trader whose vast collection of Presidential memorabilia will be auctioned Dec. 12 at Sotheby's in New York. ""He shot Garfield twice in the back in the Washington railroad station on July 2, 1881. That photograph of Guiteau is my favorite item in the collection."""
1991-11-21	Disputed Statue Sells for $275,000	A highly stylized terra-cotta sculpture of a sheep, used in religious ceremonies in West Africa 500 to 1,000 years ago, was sold at Sotheby's to an unidentified buyer for $275,000 yesterday despite a claim of ownership by the Government of Mali.
1991-11-20	Mali Seeking to Prevent Auction of Religious Statue	The Government of Mali in West Africa is seeking to prevent Sotheby's from selling the 31-inch-tall terra-cotta sculpture of a sheep that is pictured on the cover of its catalogue for a sale of African art today. Mohamed Toure, Mali's Ambassador to the United States, said yesterday that under Mali law the sculpture belonged to his nation, as do all artifacts excavated in Mali after 1985.
1991-11-15	The Art Market	The last two weeks' auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary artworks were the first real test of the art market's strength since last spring's poor sales. They proved that the market, if weak, is far from moribund. Works were actively traded, but in a bargain-hunter's paradise. Buyers called the shots, acquiring art at prices that were not only lower than those of a couple of years ago, but also often well below the auction houses' estimates for these sales. The speculators who had fueled the market of the 1980's were long gone, and the old-guard collectors returned to take their places.
1991-11-14	Contemporary Art Fails to Incite High Bidding	"Sotheby's sale of contemporary art last night resulted in another evening of prices that were much lower than expected. But bidding was more spirited than at Tuesday night's sale at Christie's, and the results were better. Sotheby's sale totaled $24.36 million as compared with Christie's total of $15.35 million. At Sotheby's, 20 works out of 82 did not sell; at Christie's, 27 lots of 67 did not find buyers. Although the ample number of bidders present was proof that interest in buying art was still strong, the final figures at both auction houses showed that buyers were unswayed by the estimates that auction houses are placing on works of art, and insistent on setting their own pricing levels. For the most part, true collectors dominated the sales, holding firm to what they considered today's fair market values. Buyers at both sales were reluctant to bid more than $1 million. 'Prices Will Stay at This Level' ""Prices are still too high,"" the Manhattan art dealer Leo Castelli said last night. ""Prices will stay at this level or lower for a while."" In light of the results on Tuesday night, Sotheby's president, Diana D. Brooks, said she was pleased and relieved. ""Tonight's sale demonstrated that you can still do business in this market,"" Mrs. Brooks said. Most of the buyers were private American collectors, she added."
1991-11-09	Sotheby's Posts a Loss	Sotheby's Holdings, the auction concern, said today that it had a pretax loss of $18 million in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $5.4 million in the period in 1990. Sotheby's said sales were always minimal in the third quarter because of the seasonal nature of the art business. It said it expects the fourth quarter and the full year to be profitable, although sales and earnings will be lower than last year.
1991-11-07	Bric-a-Brac Revisited: Not a Tag Sale	"WHO would have thought that there was anything left in Castle Howard's attics but Nanny Hawkins and her memories? Who, except Sotheby's, would have imagined that crammed into its attics, cellars, box rooms and stables were dusty bureaus and abandoned dinner services, outgrown prams and crates of old books, odd garden ornaments, shelves of rusted watering cans, gilded picture frames, forgotten family silver, bronze inkwells and numerous other leftovers from the lives of generations of the Howards of York? All has been emptied now. Castle Howard, known to millions of television viewers as the stately home where Evelyn Waugh's novel ""Brideshead Revisited"" was filmed, will be the site of a three-day Sotheby's house sale beginning on Nov. 11. The $1.35 million that the Howard family hopes to raise at the auction will be used to restore portions of the house."
1991-11-07	Wary Bidding at Auctions Reflects a Weak Art Market	"Judging from the results of the last two nights of auctions of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture at Christie's and Sotheby's, it appears that the art market is still struggling. At both sales, the adage ""quality sells"" proved truer than ever. But even quality, these days, must come at the right price. Christie's began the two-night round of auctions on Tuesday with the highly touted collection of paintings from the estate of Burton and Emily Tremaine. As the bidding began, it seemed as if the whole art world was dancing on a tightrope."
1991-10-27	Collectors Read the Bottom Lines of Vintage Comic Books	"Comic books as collectibles went WHOOM!!! this month. Two books were published surveying 50 years of the genre as pop culture, and Sotheby's in New York announced that on Dec. 18 it would hold the first sale at an international art auction house featuring only comic books. Both survey books are selling extremely well. The initial printing of ""From Aargh! to Zap!: Harvey Kurtzman's Visual History of the Comics,"" Simon & Schuster's $25 paperback, is already sold out. And ""Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics,"" by Les Daniels, is, at $45, the top seller this fall for Harry N. Abrams. About 100,000 copies are in print at this publisher, where a printing of 5,000 for art and coffee-table books is considered large."
1991-10-25	Auctions	"'Master I Am Free' A 19th-century quilt emblazoned with American flags and depicting white and black people in a variety of activities is among the most discussed folk-art items in the Americana sale taking place at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. tomorrow at Sotheby's in New York. Nancy Druckman, the director of Sotheby's folk-art department, said this week that the red, white and blue images reflect the optimism felt after the Civil War for a strong Union. She said the quilt was completed in 1867, a date embroidered on a square showing a black man, wearing a straw hat and striped coat, leading a goat-drawn cart labeled ""Ice Cream Done."" ""This is one of the most remarkable quilts I've handled in my 20-year tenure here,"" Mrs. Druckman said. ""It's most unusual to see a number of black and white people represented on a 19th-century quilt. It was made in New York State, where many people had supported the abolitionist movement. To me it represents the first blush of hopefulness after the Civil War."" Mrs. Druckman said the unidentified seller, an elderly widower, told her that it had been handed down in his wife's family in New York. Each of the 42 squares is appliqued and embroidered with a different image of people, flowers, animals or birds banded in red. On one, a black man speaks to a white man on horseback and his words, ""Master I am free,"" are embroidered between them. The house estimates the quilt will bring $50,000 to $80,000. At the same session, Sotheby's will auction 26 weather vanes from a collection of about 70 acquired over 20 years by David L. Davies, a San Francisco graphics designer and real-estate investor. The rest are to be offered in Americana sales in January and next October. Mr. Davies decided this summer to send his weather vanes to Sotheby's after he sold his carriage house in New Jersey, where they were housed. ""He had tapered off collecting weather vanes in recent years,"" Mrs. Druckman said. Sotheby's estimates that the collection will bring $700,000 to $1 million; the group to be auctioned tomorrow is estimated to sell for $110,000 to $150,000. Weather vanes of vehicles, a special interest of Mr. Davies, include a rare mid-19th-century copper vane of a fire-hose reeler, which is estimated to sell for $20,000 to $25,000, and a copper fire engine from the late 19th century made by Harris & Company of Boston, at $25,000 to $35,000. Others depicting horses, cars, a bicycle, a biplane and a hook and ladder are estimated to bring $5,000 or less each. Important Pedigrees Several impressive German silver vessels to be auctioned in a sale at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. on Wednesday at Christie's in New York were bought in the 1930's and 40's by Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born banker, philanthropist and art collector who died in 1961. Mr. Kramarsky also owned van Gogh's ""Portrait of Dr. Gachet,"" which brought $82.5 million at Christie's in New York last year in a sale to a Japanese industrialist. ""These are marvelous things with important pedigrees that are fresh to the market,"" said Christopher Hartop, who heads Christie's silver department. For example, he said, Mr. Kramarsky paid $160 for a gilded silver squirrel perched on a tree, an item made in Nuremberg, Germany, about 1600 and bought at a 1947 New York auction of silver originally owned by J. Pierpont Morgan. Christie's estimates the squirrel will bring $40,000 to $60,000. A silver-gilt cup in the form of a leather-covered shoe, a vessel made for the shoemaker's guild about 1580 in Nuremberg, was bought by Mr. Kramarsky for $650 at a 1949 sale in New York of the collection of Joseph Brummer, an art dealer. Christie's estimates the shoe will sell for $40,000 to $60,000. Another Kramarsky object from Nuremberg combines gilded silver and a nautilus shell to make a covered cup on a stand with finials of a snarling winged dragon and Neptune. Christie's presale estimate for this richly embellished object from about 1630 is $50,000 to $80,000. A Bankrupt Toy Store Christie's in New York announced this week that it would auction on Dec. 16 the period toys from the Manhattan branch of Mint and Boxed. The three-story toy shop was opened a year ago by Jeffrey S. Levitt, a British collector turned dealer. The store, on Madison Avenue at 84th Street, closed in May when Mint and Boxed filed for bankruptcy. The 550 toys are to be auctioned without starting prices in a sale that Christie's estimates will total more than $1.5 million. The contents of Mr. Levitt's store in Edgware, Middlesex, near London, are to be auctioned on Jan. 16 by Sotheby's in London in a sale of 500 toys that it estimates will total $850,000. The store went into receivership this year. . . . SOTHEBY'S, York Avenue at 72d Street, Manhattan,(212) 606-7245. Viewing hours for the Americana: 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. today. CHRISTIE'S, Park Avenue at 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 546-1010. Viewing hours for the silver: 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. today and tomorrow; 1 to 5 P.M. Sunday; 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday and 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. Tuesday."
1991-10-18	Auctions	Oriental Screens Japanese and Korean screens are among the most important offerings in the auctions to be held next week at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York. The escalation in value of Japanese screens began in the New York auctions in 1988 with a pair from the 16th century bringing $473,000 at Sotheby's. That price eclipsed the previous auction record of $143,000, paid in 1985 for a 19th-century pair sold at Christie's. Last year, a pair of 17th-century Japanese screens, depicting a panorama of Kyoto, rewrote the auction record when it brought $1.76 million.
1991-10-11	Auctions	A Few Eccentricities Wendell Cherry's collection of highly expressive ancient to modern art was known to his friends, a few dealers and some auction-house executives with whom he dealt for more than 24 years. Now the public will be able to view a small sampling of those holdings. Sixty objects from his estate are to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York in 16 different sales from October to May. The presale estimate for these works is $6 million to $8 million. Mr. Cherry was the vice chairman of Humana Inc., of Louisville, Ky., the hospital and health-insurance company that he founded in 1961 with David A. Jones, the chairman. He was 55 years old at his death on July 16 at his home in Louisville.
1991-10-04	Auctions	Avedon's Dovima One of Richard Avedon's 1955 Paris photographs of the model Dovima with elephants -- among the most widely known fashion images -- is to be auctioned in a sale at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. on Wednesday at Sotheby's in New York. The photograph shows the aristocratic Dovima in a strapless white gown and long black gloves, posed between two elephants whose trunks are lifted at exactly the same angle as her upraised arms.
1991-09-29	A Highly Personal Collection, From Shakespeare to Oz	"A voracious reader since childhood, Richard Manney began to collect rare books and manuscripts a decade ago. His library of 600 first editions and autograph copies -- children's classics, American and English novels, religious and political works, and plays by Shakespeare, Ibsen and O'Casey -- represents a highly personal assemblage of volumes. He has read most of them, and all are to be auctioned Oct. 11 at Sotheby's in New York. Mr. Manney, a New York businessman who buys media time for advertisers, said the collection is the first of his art and antiques holdings to be sold. He has formed most of the collections with his wife, Gloria. ""We are going to move to smaller quarters,"" Mr. Manney said. ""The rare books need climate control and proper housing, which we will not have in our next home."" Sotheby's estimates that the rare books and manuscripts will bring $4 million to $5 million."
1991-09-27	Auctions	"La Belle Epoque The sumptuous collection of turn-of-the-century European furniture, porcelains and sculpture to be auctioned today at Sotheby's in London was to have served as the core of a belle epoque museum in Manhattan, according to a statement in the sale catalogue. Sotheby's press release states that the owner was ""forced to abandon the plan when safety officials insisted on numerous structural changes to allow public access."""
1991-09-26	18th-Century Furniture And Art to Be Auctioned	The collection of 18th-century French furniture and European paintings put together by Elizabeth and Howard B. Keck of Los Angeles is to be auctioned in December at Sotheby's in New York, the auction house announced yesterday. The Keck collection -- 300 pieces of furniture, decorations and paintings -- was assembled over the last 15 years by Mr. Keck, the 78-year-old son of the founder and the former chairman of the Superior Oil Company, and his wife. The couple were divorced this year. Sotheby's identifies Mr. Keck as the seller of the collection it estimates will total more than $20 million.
1991-09-20	Auctions	Auction fever flared briefly last Friday during an afternoon sale of 19th-century furnishings and bric-a-brac at Sotheby's in New York. Midway through the dispersal of elaborately carved and gilded commodes, chairs and chandeliers, a bidding duel in the pre-recession style developed between two dealers vying for a pair of damaged seven-foot stone candelabra, which Sotheby's had estimated would bring $6,000 to $8,000. It was when the numbers reached $150,000 that the contest narrowed to two dealers: Carlton Hobbs of London, whose brother, John, placed bids for him from there by telephone, and Bernard Steinitz, who flew over from his Paris gallery and bid in person. They battled on, propelling the price to $330,000 -- more than 40 times Sotheby's presale estimate -- and Mr. Hobbs became the new owner.
1991-09-11	CHRONICLE	"A four-poster bed that belonged to BILL WYMAN of the Rolling Stones and before him to MICK JAGGER, was sold yesterday at auction for $24,740 to RAY GAFFNEY, an advertising photographer from London who had never bought anything at auction before. The bed was sold by Sotheby's in Billingshurst, England, about 50 miles south of London. Mr. Gaffney said he decided to buy the bed ""on a whim."""
1991-09-06	Auctions	"African Collection African artworks -- offbeat objects ranging from simply carved to robust sculptures -- are to be auctioned on Nov. 20 from the collection of Helen and Robert Kuhn of Los Angeles at Sotheby's in New York. The Kuhns' holdings of 145 wood and clay figures and artifacts are expected by the auction house to total $2.5 million to $3.9 million. In announcing the sale this week, Bernard de Grunne, who heads Sotheby's tribal art sales, said the Kuhns' wide-ranging collection was one of the most important and personal to be presented at Sotheby's in recent seasons. Represented are items made between the 13th and 19th centuries, carved in western, central and southern Africa. The Kuhns began collecting African objects in 1972 after they had formed a collection of Pre-Columbian works, a major change esthetically. ""Pre-Columbian art was pure sculpture and tomb works,"" Mrs. Kuhn said this week by telephone from her Los Angeles home. ""But African art was pulsing and alive. Our interest in African art became very focused very quickly. Six of the first 10 objects we bought were musical instruments, a side passion that continued to grow."" The Kuhns are selling only a few of their 120 musical instruments, including two sanzas, or thumb pianos, uncommon examples carved in the shape of human figures. One is expected to bring $8,000 to $12,000 and the other, $6,000 to $9,000. A slit gong or drum in the shape of a lemon wedge with four figures poised on top is expected to sell for $20,000 to $30,000. The Kuhns donated the rest of their musical instruments to the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the University of California at Los Angeles. They are to be exhibited in the new museum, which is scheduled to open next March. ""Each artwork had to speak to me,"" Mrs. Kuhn said. ""There had to be something in the carved line or the content, preferably something magical."" One of the rarest objects in the sale is a two-foot-tall horse and rider, a 17th- or 18th-century work by a Dogon west African artisan from an area now known as Mali. Mr. de Grunne said the equestrian sculpture was one of about 12 surviving examples of this subject, size and state of preservation, carved in that period and region. ""It is very architectural and has a warm brown patina that covers every inch: the teeny head, the long legs and the chubby body,"" he said. The auction house's presale estimate is $150,000 to $200,000. A higher price -- $250,000 to $350,000 -- is expected by Sotheby's for a zoomorphic figure in terra cotta. The ramlike animal, standing 31 inches high, has a small head and large legs. It was modeled possibly as early as the 13th century, but no later than the 15th century. ""The area was flooded and it was buried for about 500 years, which probably accounts for the weathered, crackled surface,"" Mr. de Grunne said. ""Why they made such near-life-size representations, no one knows."" One of Mrs. Kuhn's favorite pieces is a Fang figure, carved in central Africa in an area now called Gabon, to decorate the top of a reliquary box for ancestor bones, a box long separated from the figure. The Kuhns kept the 17-inch-tall Fang carving on the coffee table in their living room, she said. Sotheby's presale estimate is $150,000 to $200,000. Another major work is a Luba stool, with a base of a kneeling female figure, carved before 1860 in the area now known as Zaire. The presale estimate is $250,000 to $350,000. The stool was cited by Susan Vogel, director of the Center for African Art in Manhattan, in speaking this week about the Kuhns' African art. ""It's a strong collection,"" she said. ""They bought a lot of things nobody else was paying attention to. When a large group of Himba, also called Luba, pieces came on the market, the ones they chose were different from what others chose. Their Luba stool is one of those pieces, different from other ones selected and made by a very singular hand. That's been true in a lot of their buying."" Mrs. Kuhn is a founder of the Ethnic Arts Council in Los Angeles, which finances research and exhibitions of ethnic art, and is a member of the acquisitions committee of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in Washington. She said she and her husband, a physician, decided to sell their African holdings when he retired last December. ""We are changing our life style,"" she said. ""We have a vacation home in Utah and wish to be freer of possessions."" They continue to collect Japanese scrolls, masks and Ikebana baskets. New Job for Curator Clement E. Conger -- former curator of the White House and the outgoing curator of the Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the State Department -- is to join Christie's in November as a senior consultant on American decorative arts. The 78-year-old Mr. Conger brings to Christie's 30 years' experience as curator of the State Department. During his tenure, he assembled through gifts and loans one of the most important collections of 18th- and 19th-century American antiques in this country. Among collectors and dealers, he is known as ""the grand acquisitor"" and ""the great persuader."" The collection of 4,500 objects is valued at more than $60 million. When asked this week what he would do at Christie's, Mr. Conger said by telephone from his vacation home in Rehoboth, Del., ""I'll mix with collectors and that sort of thing."" At the White House, where he was curator from 1970 to 1986, he refurbished 27 rooms, expanding and refining the house's collection of early 19th-century American antiques."
1991-08-19	Hard Times at Auction Houses: Has the Art Market Hit Bottom?	"In one week in May 1990, the Japanese industrialist Ryoel Saito paid $160 million for two paintings bought in New York: $82.5 million for van Gogh's ""Portrait of Dr. Gachet"" (1890) at Christie's and $78.1 million for Renoir's ""At the Moulin de la Galette"" (1876) at Sotheby's. This year, by comparison, the most expensive work auctioned was Degas's ""Racehorses"" (1870's), which was sold for $9.7 million in June to an unidentified buyer at Christie's in London. After five years of rapidly rising prices, the frenzied buying of art at auction is over. Sotheby's and Christie's have gone into reverse: the two aucton houses, the world's largest, announced record declines in total sales for the season, which ends on Aug. 31. Sotheby's is projecting a 59 percent decline in international sales, to $1.3 billion from a record $3.2 billion in 1990. Christie's worldwide sales are expected to fall 50 percent, to $1.2 billion from $2.4 billion."
1991-08-09	Paley Apartment Items Are to Be Auctioned	The contents of William S. Paley's Fifth Avenue apartment, other than his collection of 19th- and 20th-century art, are to be auctioned on Oct. 4 in New York City, Sotheby's announced yesterday. The 300 pieces of French furniture, tribal art, Oriental art and precious objects from the estate of Mr. Paley, who died in October, were estimated by Sotheby's to bring about $2 million.
1991-07-26	Auction-House Sales Are Off 50 Percent for Year	Sotheby's and Christie's announced yesterday that they expected record declines of 50 percent or more in their worldwide sales for the 1990-91 auction season, which ends Aug. 31. The declines are the first reported by Sotheby's since 1984 and the first for Christie's since 1985. Both auction houses reported that sales in New York continued to be about half of their worldwide totals.
1991-07-19	Auctions	The Mantle Magic Mickey Mantle showed up this week at the New York restaurant on Central Park South that bears his name, to authenticate and autograph a gray baseball shirt he had worn in 1967. The shirt is the most important of the 279 items to be auctioned at 7 P.M. on Wednesday at the Southgate Tower Hotel, Seventh Avenue at 31st Street in Manhattan. The sale is the first public auction in New York by Leland's, a Manhattan-based sports memorabilia auction house that has conducted auctions by mail since 1983.
1991-07-16	23 Golf Clubs Bring $1 Million at Sotheby's	A collection of golf clubs -- 23 woods and irons said to have been owned by winners of the British Open golf tournament -- brought $1,031,101 yesterday in a sale by Sotheby's in Chester, England. The price was the highest paid at auction for sporting memorabilia, more than doubling the $451,000 paid on March 23 at Sotheby's in New York for a Honus Wagner baseball card from about 1910. The golfing memorabilia sale was held as aficionados of the sport gathered for the British Open, which begins this weekend in Southport, 50 miles north of Chester.
1991-07-12	Auctions	Two Masks Go Home Two of the three American Indian ceremonial masks that were auctioned at Sotheby's in New York on May 21 -- despite protests by two tribes -- were returned last week to their tribal owners.
1991-06-28	Auctions	Bart Meets Cinderella Animation art -- especially postwar celluloids of Cinderella, Snoopy and Bart Simpson -- brought remarkable prices in last week's sales of collectibles at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York. Defying the trend of prices' for art, antiques and collectibles leveling off from their highs in the 1980's, many cartoon images brought sums that were two to five times the presale estimates by the auction houses.
1991-06-23	On the Block, Glossy Survivors From the 18th Century	Rare when they were made, American 18th-century furnishings with lacquerlike japanned finishes continue to be uncommon commodities on the antiques market. In recent months, however, two pieces have become available for sale in New York, focusing attention on the fewer than 50 surviving period chests, clocks and chairs with this Oriental-style decoration, which imitates the hard, shimmering finish of Japanese lacquering. Last October, a William and Mary highboy was exhibited by Israel Sack, a Manhattan dealer, at the International Antique Dealers Show in New York. Its price tag of $2.75 million was one of the highest for any object at the fair. Although not sold at the show, the flat-topped cabinet with trumpet legs, all lavishly embellished with exotic birds, flowers and pagodas in Oriental landscapes, was bought in March for $1.5 million by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.

1991-06-16	"ART;
Act of Faith"	"Not many businesses have had the courage, if that is what it takes, to set up shop in what used to be East Berlin. One that has is Sotheby's, the auction house, which has taken a 30-year lease on the ground floor of a former Prussian palace on the elegant, once-fashionable Unter den Linden boulevard. The company held its first auction on its new premises two weeks ago.

Sent there for the occasion were 106 works of 20th-century German art -- paintings, drawings, watercolors and sculpture rounded up in England, other European countries and the United States, as well as Germany. Most of the buyers, as it turned out, were German collectors from the western part of the country. They spent $4.3 million (with 32 percent of the works unsold), less than Sotheby's pre-sale estimate of $5 million to $6 million, but the auction house pronounced itself ""very happy"" with the results."

""This was a record for any printed Americana,"" said David Redden, the auctioneer, who is a senior vice president at Sotheby's in Manhattan. ""It was far and away the highest price for historical Americana ever."""
1991-06-07	Auctions	"A Columbus Letter During a raging storm on the high seas as he approached the Azores in February 1493, Christopher Columbus penned a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella describing his first trip westward seeking a route to the Orient. ""I made my way to the Indian Sea,"" he wrote, ""where I found a great many islands inhabited by innumerable people, all of which I have claimed for our King, putting up flags of possession with no one contradicting me."" Fearing that his letter might perish with him at sea and that its news would be lost, Columbus made a copy and placed it in a cask that he threw overboard."

1991-05-31	Picasso Replaced by Forgery In 80's Appears at Sotheby's	"A $1 million Picasso painting that had been stolen from the home of a Manhattan woman and replaced with a forgery appeared mysteriously yesterday at Sotheby's, where an art dealer had taken it for an appraisal and possible auction, the police said. The painting, ""Head of Woman with Golden Earrings"" (1943), was stolen from the home of Emily McFadden Staempfli between 1980 and 1985, but was not discovered missing until last fall because a fake had been put in its place, said Inspector Charles Prestia of the Police Department's special investigations unit."
1991-05-26	Topics of The Times; Dancing With Masks	Obedient to the laws of commerce, Sotheby's ignored appeals from two Indian tribes to withdraw three ceremonial masks from an art auction last Tuesday. Yet the gods of the Hopi and Navajo nations in Arizona found an unexpected friend. Elizabeth Sackler, who had never bid at an auction before, paid $39,050 for the handsome dancing masks -- and said she would return them to their rightful owners. Her generous gesture may open eyes to the offense taken by Native Americans when objects with spiritual significance become investment commodities, trophies for collectors or gimcracks for interior decorators. Congress last November heeded tribal protests by adopting the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which makes possible the repatriation of some cultural properties from museums and collectors.
1991-05-24	Auctions	German Expressionism Sale Sotheby's first art auction in Berlin -- the first, in fact, for any international house in that city -- is to be held Thursday night in an 18th-century palace on Unter den Linden in the eastern sector of the formerly divided city. Sotheby's now operates an office out of the historic residence, which was the home in the 18th century to Frederick the Great, in the 19th to the Prussian Finance Ministry and in the late 20th to the Soviet-German Friendship Society.
1991-05-22	Buyer Vows to Return 3 Masks to Indians	"Three American Indian masks, two Hopi and one probably Navajo, that were auctioned yesterday at Sotheby's despite protests by both tribes, were bought by a New York woman who said in an interview later that she would return them to the Indians. ""The whole point of coming here was to purchase these ritual objects and to return them to the Hopi and Navajo nations to whom they apparently belong,"" said Elizabeth Sackler shortly after paying a total of $39,050 for the masks. ""It is clearly the right thing to do. I certainly want to make sure they are returned to the rightful owners."""
1991-05-21	3 Indian Masks To Stay In Auction	Three American Indian masks, two Hopi and one Navajo, are to remain in an auction this morning at Sotheby's despite protests from both tribes. This month, Sotheby's received two letters asking that the masks be removed from its auction because they are sacred or religiously significant objects.
1991-05-17	Auctions	A Tlingit Thunderbird A monumental American Indian screen emblazoned with a spread-winged thunderbird, to be auctioned next week, is believed to be the first such Northwest Coast tribal artifact ever to be offered at public sale. The heraldic panel, a 24-by-12-foot wood crest of a Tlingit clan painted before World War I in Auke, an Alaskan fishing village north of Juneau, is to be presented at 10:15 A.M. on Tuesday at Sotheby's in New York.
1991-05-10	Auctions	"A Frida Kahlo The second Frida Kahlo self-portrait from the 1940's to be auctioned in New York in a year is the most important work in Christie's Latin American art sale at 7 P.M. on Wednesday. The painting, from 1947, is an intense study of this solemn-faced Mexican artist with her long thick black hair hanging loosely. It was painted after a year of undergoing operations to correct injuries from a bus accident when she was 18 years old. At 24 by 17 inches, it is twice the size of her self-portrait ""Diego and I,"" from 1949, which brought $1.4 million last May at Sotheby's. This small work, which was the first Latin American artwork to exceed $1 million at auction, shows Kahlo with her hair down and with an image of the artist Diego Rivera, her husband, painted at the center of her forehead."
1991-05-05	Even in Pinch-Penny Times, Silver Is Holding Its Own	"Is antique silver recession-proof? ""Nothing is recession-proof,"" said Michael Koopman, a London dealer, following last month's highly successful silver sales at Christie's and Sotheby's in Manhattan. ""But silver seems to be holding its own rather well right now."""
1991-05-03	Auctions	"Act II of the two-week marathon of spring art auctions at Manhattan's two major houses begins at 7 P.M. on Tuesday at Sotheby's with Impressionist and modern art that the house estimates will bring $31 million to $43 million. The sales continue on Wednesday at 7 P.M. at Christie's, where the estimated total ranges from $34 million to $47 million. The totals expected by these houses are the lowest in five years -- one-half or one-third of the presale estimates of the sales held in November. Sotheby's is to auction a group of important works from the collection of Irene Mayer Selznick, the Broadway producer whose plays included Tennessee Williams's 1947 hit ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Mrs. Selznick, a daughter of the Hollywood studio head Louis B. Mayer and the first wife of the producer David O. Selznick, was 83 years old at her death on Oct. 11. The seven paintings, pastels and drawings by Matisse, Seurat, Degas, Fantin-Latour, Vuillard, Cassatt and Renoir to be sold from her collection are estimated by Sotheby's to bring $8 million to $10 million."
1991-05-02	Auction Fever Cools For Art	The fevered speculation that drove art auction prices up over the last five years was virtually absent this week as collectors, dealers and museum curators crowded into Sotheby's on Tuesday night and Christie's last night for contemporary art sales. Most came to see if the works presented would sell, and at realistic prices. Others came in search of bargains, and many were successful. What they found were paintings and sculptures at prices that prompted them to buy enthusiastically, especially the works of artists of the 1970's and 1980's, representing a new development at these sales. Both houses said they persuaded sellers to lower their estimates and to accept reserves that were moderate.
1991-05-01	Rauschenberg Work Brings Sale Record	"Robert Rauschenberg's ""Rebus"" from 1955 -- auctioned 18 months ago for a record $6.3 million -- was sold last night at Sothebys's in Manhattan for $7.3 million. The price was the highest paid at auction for a work by the artist and at Sotheby's current sale of postwar art. Rauschenberg's curiously serene ""Rebus,"" a huge 8-by-11-foot work splashed with paint, plaster, varnish, graffiti, a torn poster, comics and photographs, was added to Sotheby's sale after the catalogue went to press in early March. The owner, Hans Thulin, a Swedish real-estate investor, was ordered to sell ""Rebus"" by the Swedish finance company Nyckeln to whom he had given the work as collateral on a loan."
1991-04-30	Who Owns Stolen Artifact? College Confronts a Museum	A small college and a big museum are in a tense tug of war over the ownership of a rare piece of Egyptian art stolen more than a decade ago. The case -- which may involve a murder -- raises an important legal question about who owns a stolen article later acquired in good faith. The work, a dazzling ornamental breastplate that once adorned a royal coffin, was stolen in the late 1970's from Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., and later was sold to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston by an antiques dealer through Sotheby's. Neither the museum nor Sotheby's knew at the time that the work had been stolen. Nor, in fact, did Lafayette, whose president, Robert I. Rotberg, says the theft came to light only toward the end of 1987.

Dr. Gunter Brosche, head of the music department at the library, said in a telephone interview from Vienna yesterday that the library had agreed in November or December to buy the 108-page manuscript from Miss Mahler, who lives in London, for $535,000.

Many of the sauceboats, tureens and chocolate pots were melted down, the head of Christie's silver sales in New York, Christopher Hartop, said in an interview this week. This scarcity makes the collection of 60 silver utensils, vessels and candleholders from the reigns of Louis XIV, XV and XVI -- to be auctioned on April 18 at Christie's -- quite an event to aficionados of such tablewares, he said. He described the silver holdings assembled decades ago by a Philadelphia couple as ""the most comprehensive to appear at auction in 20 years."""
1991-04-03	Declaration of Independence Found in a $4 Picture Frame	"A collector who spent $4 at a Pennsylvania flea market two years ago for a dismal painting because he liked the frame now finds himself the possessor of a first printing of the Declaration of Independence. It is expected to bring $800,000 to $1 million at an auction on June 4. The discovery was announced yesterday by David N. Redden, head of the book and manuscript department at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Mr. Redden described the document, found behind the painting when the collector took the frame apart, as an ""unspeakably fresh copy"" of the declaration. ""The fact that it has been in the backing of the frame preserved it,"" he said. Of the 24 copies known to survive, only 3 are in private hands, he added."
1991-03-29	Auctions	After the Boom Sotheby's and Christie's are projecting the lowest totals in five years for their May auctions of Impressionist and modern art in New York. When the catalogues for the evening sessions of these auctions closed this week at both houses, there were 47 works in Sotheby's sale, estimated to bring $30 million to $40 million, and 58 at Christie's, valued at a total of $34.4 million to $46.6 million.

The purchase, at Sotheby's in New York, represented the highest price paid at auction for sporting memorabilia, about four times the previous record, set in 1989 for another Honus Wagner card. Issued by tobacco producers in 1909 and 1910, the Wagner cards are scarce because Wagner opposed smoking and objected to his name being linked to the cigarettes advertised on the backs of the cards. Only 40 cards depicting Wagner are known to exist; the one sold yesterday was described by Sotheby's as being in ""mint condition."""

The objects to be offered date from the 1960's to the 80's and include works by such artists as Philip Guston, Jonathan Borofsky, Cy Twombly, Brice Marden and Elizabeth Murray.
1991-03-12	Auction Houses Are Being Drawn To Unified Germany	The man who will represent Sotheby's in Berlin spends a lot of time conferring with builders these days. The newest outpost of the London auction house is a soaring neo-classical palace, just off the boulevard Unter den Linden, that bears the burden of Prussian history on its walls. Built by a merchant in the 18th century, it was bequeathed to Frederick the Great when business failed. Transformed into the Prussian Finance Ministry in the 19th century, it became the seat of the Soviet-German Friendship Society when the Red Army marched into Berlin and planted Communist rulers in the eastern portion of the city. But now, with Germany reunited, Barclays Bank and Salomon Brothers have moved in, and when the carpenters, masons and painters are done, so too will Sotheby's. For if the recession is hurting auction business in England and America, Germany's economy booms, and with it trade in art and collectibles. With the Berlin wall gone, Sotheby's and its rival, Christie's, which has set up shop in western Berlin, are poised to acquire art treasures hidden for decades during Communist rule.

1991-02-17	The Boys of Summer Play Ball Forever, for Collectors	Baseball memorabilia became a major-league collectible in the 1980's when the prices paid for bats, balls, uniforms, locker keys, rings, pendants, press pins and the ubiquitous palm-sized cards soared. Now, fans of artifacts relating to the boys of summer -- especially Honus Wagner, Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Jackie Robinson -- expect even higher prices at the sale next month of one of the most important baseball collections ever formed. Assembled over the last five years by James C. Copeland, a California sporting-goods retailer, the collection of 873 items or groups of items is to be auctioned on March 22 and 23 at Sotheby's in Manhattan; the sale is estimated to bring from $5 million to $7 million.

Experts at the auction house authenticated the manuscript, missing more than a century, on its arrival in New York in late October. They delayed the announcement until yesterday while awaiting further documentation."
1991-02-01	Auctions	"The Wrists Have It While Grandpa's pocket watch may still find its way to the auction house today, wristwatches have been dominating sales of timepieces in recent years. ""Wristwatches eclipsed the sales of pocket watches in our auctions about 1984,"" said Daryn Schnipper, who heads the sales of timepieces at Sotheby's in New York. ""In 1980, wristwatches represented about 1 percent of our sales. Today they account for 75 percent of our watch sales."" The popularity of all types of watches will be tested again next Friday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. in New York at Sotheby's first sale this year of watches and clocks. Ms. Schnipper said there was no indication of trouble in sales of watches last year. On the contrary, she said, many people claim watches fare well during recessions and in wartime ""because they have intrinsic value and are small and portable."" Last year, when the weakened economy resulted in lower prices and higher numbers of unsold offerings at auctions in other fields, Ms. Schnipper said, watches continued to sell for strong prices. Usually, she said, watch sales attract bids from collectors and dealers in Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States. Sotheby's estimates that next week's sale will bring $3.8 million to $4.5 million, about the same as its October auction, which totaled $4.4 million."

Americana -- Philadelphia and New York furniture, Hartford pistols and Rhode Island silver -- is to be auctioned at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York this weekend and next. Collectors' sales, they are traditionally the largest and most important in this category held all year by these houses. They are timed to coincide with the Winter Antiques Show, which opens to the public tomorrow at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan. This year, the armory show is focused more than ever before on Americana.

""The diversity is overwhelming,"" said TIMOTHY J. SWEENEY, the executive director of the G.M.H.C., the nonprofit AIDS service organization. ""It shows that artists personally identify with the AIDS crisis and want to raise consciousness."" The auction, on March 5 at Sotheby's in New York, will require tickets costing $100 to $1,000, but the exhibition, from March 2 to March 5, will be free and open to the public."
1991-01-18	Auctions	"Gothic Revival Table British versions of the Gothic Revival style have increased in popularity in recent years among collectors on both sides of the Atlantic. A hefty five-foot-long Gothic Revival table from 1805 is one of the most important offerings at the auction of English furniture to be held on Feb. 2 at Christie's in Manhattan. Probably designed by the architect James Wyatt for a neo-Gothic library that was added about 1805 to a Jacobean house in West Dean Park, Chichester, in West Sussex, the oak table on cluster column legs is embellished with quatrefoils and Gothic arches. Its green marble top is framed with pierced brass trim. The presale estimate is $50,000 to $70,000. Asked about the estimate, which was lower than recent prices on comparable Gothic Revival furniture at New York galleries, William J. Iselin, who heads European furniture sales at Christie's in New York, said: ""The current owner paid $66,000 for this table when we auctioned it in New York in 1986. Given the general sentiment against hiking an estimate over a price paid recently, we kept the estimate close to what he paid. It should be a good test of the market for this style of furniture."" George III Armchairs At a Sotheby's sale of English furniture to be held at 2 P.M. on Jan. 26 in Manhattan, a pair of George III armchairs from about 1755 is the most important offering. Elaborately carved with scrolls, foliage and ribbons and finished in pale blue paint and gilding, the chairs are from the estate of Henry Ford 2d. The presale estimate is $200,000 to $250,000. George Read, an English-furniture specialist at Sotheby's, said, ""Good big pairs of chairs have been bringing around $200,000."" An example he mentioned was a George II pair of walnut chairs that sold for $220,000 in 1988. ""The other ones are more commercial: less ornate and the type of chairs you can put anywhere,"" Mr. Read said. ""I think it's going to be a serious collector who will be interested in these chairs."" Old Masters The Old Masters auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's last week in Manhattan attracted art dealers, collectors and celebrity-conscious auctiongoers. Those who came to view art collected by the rich and famous headed for Christie's to see the Old Master collection formed by Imelda and Ferdinand E. Marcos, when Mr. Marcos was President of the Philippines. When these paintings were auctioned last Friday morning, all 99 were sold for a total of $15.4 million, surpassing Christie's most optimistic expectations of $10 million at most. Among the most important paintings was Raphael's ""St. Catherine of Alexandria,"" which was bought for $1.65 million by the Italian Government to hang at the Uffizi in Florence. El Greco's ""Coronation of the Virgin"" brought $2.1 million in a sale to Stanley Moss, a New York City dealer in Old Master works. The Marcos sale was the most successful of these auctions, all of which fared better at the New York houses than did the Impressionist, modern and postwar art sales in November. ""Unlike Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, the Old Master field never exploded,"" said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in the United States. ""It has always been very steady."" At Christie's second sale last Friday afternoon, Old Master paintings from different owners were auctioned. In that sale, 68 of the 84 offerings were sold for a total of $11.9 million, just above the house estimate of $7.9 million to $11.4 million. All the 10 most important works were sold, and 9 of these realized prices surpassing Christie's expectations. Did the weak dollar contribute to the success of this sale? ""The Italian and European presence at the sale was a bit stronger than usual because of the dollar,"" Ian Kennedy, who heads Christie's Old Masters sales, said. ""They bought many works."" The painting that brought the highest price was Pieter Bruegel the Younger's ""Wedding Dance,"" from about 1600, selling for $1.05 million. The presale estimate was $400,000 to $600,000. A pair of mid-18th-century paintings by Giuseppe Bonito, ""The Musical Party"" and ""The Poet,"" was expected to bring at most $600,000; the pair sold for $748,000. At Sotheby's, there were major disappointments at its Old Masters sale on Jan. 10. At that sale, only 66 of the 107 offerings were sold for a total of $9.8 million, against an estimate of $13.8 million to $19.5 million. One of the biggest problems for the auction house was the group of eight Old Master paintings owned by Saul P. Steinberg, the New York financier. Six of the paintings failed to sell. Asked why, George Wachter, who heads Old Master sales at Sotheby's in New York, said this week in a telephone interview from Tampa, Fla., that all were purchased recently. ""All the Steinberg paintings were bought within the last 10 years from dealers, at prices close to the low estimates that we published,"" Mr. Wachter said. The Steinberg paintings were offered with some of the sale's highest presale estimates. Those that did not sell included works by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Hendrick Gerritsz Pot, Theodor Rombouts, Karel Dujardin, Jan van Goyen and Rubens. SOTHEBY'S, York Avenue at 72d Street in Manhattan, (212) 606-7245. Viewing hours for the English furniture sale: 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. tomorrow; 1 to 5 P.M. Sunday; 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.

A hearing to explore that possibility will be held in Manhattan on Jan. 30 by the New York State Assembly's committees on investigations and on tourism, sports and the arts. The hearing is based on a wide-ranging memorandum and draft legislation prepared by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester. ""I think it's fair at this time to characterize the art market as a sort of commodities market,"" Mr. Brodsky said in a telephone interview. ""Art-market practices are no longer merely of concern to a privileged few, but to the general public, and it's time for the art community to take a hard look at itself."""
1990-12-21	Sales Decline Is Reported By Sotheby's	"Sotheby's auction house issued international 1990 sales figures yesterday showing the sharpest declines since 1982 and representing what a top Sotheby's official said was ""the beginning of a return to normalcy"" in auction sales. Sotheby's sales for the year totaled $2.4 billion, down from $2.9 billion for 1989, a 17.5 percent decrease, according to the auction house. Sales for the fall were $751 million, down from $1.5 billion a year ago, a drop of more than 50 percent. Sales at Christie's auction house, announced this month, were $1.96 billion for the year, a decrease of 8.5 percent from 1989. The companies' totals for the year were ahead of 1988. 'A Return to Normalcy' Michael L. Ainslie, the president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings, attributed the decline in sales to the ""uncertain worldwide political and economic climate."""
1990-12-16	The Art Boom: Is It Over, or Is This Just a Correction?	The biggest art boom in history may be over, but the market still has a long way to tumble to reach the levels of just two to three years ago. The growth of the art market through the 1980's reflected a money-obsessed decade when billionaires replaced millionaires in business magazine pantheons. There seemed to be no limits. Prices went ever higher and the boom offered the once-unimaginable prospect of a $100 million painting. It nearly came to pass.
1990-12-14	Auctions	"Mechanical Toys A Pennsylvania collector who started acquiring toys in 1929 is selling his 362 cast-iron and tin wagons, trucks, cars, planes, mechanical banks and cap pistols. Anthony Koveleski's holdings are described by Sotheby's as one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of American toys ever auctioned in New York. The sale, to be held at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. on Tuesday at Sotheby's, is estimated to bring $378,100 to $514,500. Mr. Koveleski said by telephone from his home in Scranton, Pa., that his favorite toy was a J. & E. Stevens mechanical bank from 1896 that depicts the story of William Tell. ""It has a legend and the action is terrific,"" he said. ""A penny placed on Tell's gun triggers the action, firing the gun, which sends the penny flying. The coin knocks the apple off the boy's head and is deposited in the base of the tree."" The presale estimate is $500 to $700."
1990-12-13	Sotheby's Announces International Changes	Sotheby's in London has announced that it is restructuring its European and Far Eastern operations and reducing its staff internationally by about 6 percent. Lord Gowrie, chairman of Sotheby's in Europe and the Far East, said that these changes were the result of a decline in art sales and of an internal study in 1989 of sales at Sotheby's galleries in Chester and Sussex near London.
1990-12-07	Auctions	"Beckett Annotations Samuel Beckett's well-thumbed rehearsal copy from the 1953 Paris production of ""Waiting for Godot"" is to be auctioned at Sotheby's in London at 11 A.M. on Thursday. The ink-stained author's version of this seminal work -- written in 1948-49, published in French in 1952 and performed first in Paris -- is missing its front cover and is marked on the title page in blue ballpoint, ""prompt copy 1953."" Beckett, who read the part of Pozzo in the first act during some rehearsals after the original actor had dropped out, noted his ideas for changes in dialogue and stage directions for Pozzo, Vladimir, Estragon and Lucky, writing in pencil and pen. The annotations and insertions, ranging from a single word to several lines of dialogue, cover 30 pages of the play. The presale estimate for the Godot is $59,100 to $78,800. In 1964, Beckett presented this Godot to his London publisher, John Calder, and his wife, Bettina Jonic. ""He gave it to me when he used to stay with me in London in the 1960's,"" Mr. Calder said in a telephone interview last weekend from New Jersey while on a visit to this country. (When the Calders were divorcing, a British court ruled that the Godot had to be returned to Beckett, who then gave it to Mr. Calder). Mr. Calder is selling the Godot along with letters and cards from Beckett, 7 lots of corrected proofs of the author's poems and prose works and 22 contracts. ""Unfortunately, it is all of the Beckett material -- all the correspondence and iconographic material,"" he said. Why is Mr. Calder selling his Beckett archive? ""Independent publishing is going through a tough time right now,"" Mr. Calder said. ""The problem is the big publishers have been swallowing up all the smaller ones."" The presale estimate for the entire archive is $101,000 to $154,000. Asked why the overall estimate appeared to be low, Peter Beal, a manuscripts specialist at Sotheby's London, said yesterday from his office: ""It doesn't seem low to us. For a marked-up play its got to be pretty special to spend tens of thousands. If you had the full working manuscript, that would be something else."" Rochas Furnishings Helene Rochas's blue lacquer room in her Paris home is to be redecorated without the Art Deco furnishings the fashion designer collected in the 1960's and 70's. The contents of the room -- 37 chairs, tables, lamps and accessories by Pierre Legrain, Eileen Gray and Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann -- are to be auctioned at 2:30 P.M. on Sunday at the Hotel Metropole Palace in Monte Carlo by Christie's . In the sale, which is expected to bring in a total of $925,000 to $1 million, the outstanding piece is a 1923 African-inspired lacquered wood stool by Pierre Legrain. Mrs. Rochas paid $19,696 for it at the 1972 Paris sale of the collection of the couturier Jacques Doucet; Christie's expects it to sell for $60,000 to $80,000. Two exotic pieces of furniture by Miss Gray -- a lacquered wood sofa expected to bring $140,000 to $180,000 and a rosewood veneered bench ($60,000 to $80,000) -- are also African in spirit. Ruhlmann's ""Antilope,"" a silvered-bronze mirror of circular design on a horn-shaped base, made between 1923 and 1928, is expected to bring $8,000 to $12,000. ""Ruhlmann gave them as New Year's presents to architects and decorators -- people who brought him business,"" said Olivier Brommet, a Christie's Art Deco specialist in London. Harrison Memorabilia Rex Harrison's performance as Uninvited Guest in T. S. Eliot's ""Cocktail Party,"" a role the actor created, is recalled in a copy of the play, signed by the author and dedicated to Harrison, that is to be auctioned at 2 P.M. on Thursday at William Doyle Galleries in Manhattan. The play, which is expected by Doyle to bring $600 to $800, is among 185 items of the actor's library, wardrobe and collection of theatrical memorabilia from his New York apartment. Proceeds of the sale, expected to total $63,000 to $93,000, are to benefit the Sir Rex Harrison drama scholarship at Boston University. Sir Rex, a man who improved every hat he wore, left many hats, including a group in next week's sale: one top hat and eight tweed-plaid featherless numbers, of the kind called ""the Rex Harrison hat."" Doyle's presale estimate is $100 to $200 for the lot. Asked why so many hats were included in the estimate, Doyle's president, Michael J. Shay, said the presale figure did not reflect ""celebrity value, which is highly subjective."" He added, ""We prefer to be conservative and let the bidders determine the values as they see them."" 13th-Century Bestiary A 13th-century English bestiary -- a book about real and imaginary animals -- abundantly illustrated with 112 colored-ink drawings on vellum, was sold last Friday at Sotheby's in London for $5.85 million, the second-highest price at auction for any manuscript. The buyer of the Northumberland Bestiary, Nicholas Poole-Wilson of Bernard Quaritch, a London dealer, would not say whom he was representing. ""I can't comment on the purchase, but I can comment on the manuscript,"" Mr. Poole-Wilson said by telephone after the sale. ""It is prime medieval art, the English bestiary at its best. The bestiary was a very English phenomenon, particularly in the 13th century. Only about 40 survive."" Christopher de Hamel, who heads Sotheby's sales of Western manuscripts in London, said the 148-page manuscript was the last English bestiary recorded in private hands and the first to come to auction in 101 years. It was sold by the 11th Duke of Northumberland from Alnwick castle, where the manuscript had been since the 18th century. ""We have not been told why he is selling anything,"" said D'Estey Bond, a Sotheby's press spokeswoman. She added that he was selling some antiquities and documents in next week's sales. WILLIAM DOYLE, 175 East 87th Street, (212) 427-2730. Viewing hours for the Rex Harrison collection: 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. tomorrow; noon to 5 P.M. Sunday; 9 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. Monday; 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday."
1990-11-30	Auctions	"Einstein and Freud on War> ""Is there a way to liberate man from the doom of war?"" wrote Albert Einstein to Sigmund Freud in 1932. Einstein's letter -- a working draft with many corrections -- and Freud's neatly penned, thoughtful response, covering 14 pages, are to be auctioned on Dec. 11 at Sotheby's in New York. Both men write of the human capacity to hate and destroy, expressing their convictions about the need for an international court to prevent war. Freud saw two possible ways to avoid war: through man's changing cultural disposition and the threat of terror. The letters, which were written at the request of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, were printed in 1933 in an edition of fewer than 200 copies, under the title ""Why War?"" Marsha Malinowski, one of Sotheby's manuscript specialists, said the letters were banned in Germany when they were printed, and never became widely known."
1990-11-23	Auctions	The downward spiral of art prices continued this week at the November auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York, with the action, or absence of it, witnessed by hundreds of spectators. At the sales of tribal art and Impressionist, postwar and modern prints, the prices paid were mostly at the low end or below the house estimates, and about 25 percent or more of what was offered did not sell. The only auctions that attracted spirited bidding were the sales of Latin American and pre-Columbian art, although even at these sessions many works found no buyers. The print sales attracted large crowds of collectors and dealers to Sotheby's last weekend and to Christie's on Monday and Tuesday, but the bidding was less than impressive. At both houses, the buying was down, even more at the sales of postwar prints, a field dominated by American buyers, than at the auctions of Impressionist and modern prints, where international buyers are a major factor.
1990-11-16	Garbo's Glamour Enlivens Auction	The Garbo magic has achieved what no artist was able to do for this month's auction sales: it restored glamour, excited bidding and high prices to a lackluster market. Greta Garbo's fans, 1,500 strong, surged into Sotheby's yesterday afternoon to watch and bid at the auction of her artworks and antiques. Most of those who came to buy went away disppointed as prices soared to 20 times Sotheby's presale estimates. All of Miss Garbo's possessions from her Manhattan apartment -- paintings of dogs, fruits and flowers; pink porcelain ashtrays, Louis XV chairs and gilded candlesticks -- were sold.
1990-11-14	Impressionists and Moderns Auctioned for $84.4 Million	The auction world continued its roller-coaster performance last night in Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art. Some of the offerings brought less than the estimated prices, with exceptions including three paintings from the Greta Garbo estate. Last night's sale at Sotheby's offered 69 works, of which 52 were sold for a total of $84.4 million. The house estimate was $91 million to $124.6 million.
1990-11-10	The Things With Which She Was Alone	"Two kinds of people turned out for the opening of a five-day exhibition of the Collection of Greta Garbo at Sotheby's auction house yesterday: People who appreciate paintings by Renoir and Bonnard and French antique furnishings with a classy provenance. And people who would have gone to an exhibition of Garbo's garbage. Ross Clark of Putnam County, N.Y., is in the latter category. Transfixed by an 18th-century footstool, Mr. Clark saw more than a piece of beechwood with an upholstered top and circular taperedlegs. He saw Garbo's feet, propped up, in flat-heel shoes. ""I read somewhere she wore size 9AAA,"" he said."
1990-11-09	Trial Ordered in Suit Over Silver at Sotheby's	The State Supreme Court was ordered yesterday by the Apellate Division in Manhattan to proceed to trial on two conflicting claims of ownership on 14 pieces of ancient Roman silver that Sotheby's is trying to sell for the Marquess of Northampton. Yugoslavia and Lebanon have each sued Sotheby's and the owners of the silver to have it returned.
1990-11-09	Auctions	"November Sales, Round 2 As the one-week series of contemporary-art auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York ends, collectors are focusing their attention on next week's sales of Impressionist and modern art. All of the late 19th- and early 20th-century works to be auctioned in the sales, which begin on Monday night, go on view today at the two houses. At Sotheby's, many of the most important paintings and sculptures to be auctioned are from collections -- each comprising works by a variety of artists -- formed by the rich and famous. Greta Garbo collected paintings by Renoir, Bonnard and Alexej von Jawlensky. Henry Ford 2d roamed more widely, buying art by Renoir, Cezanne, Modigliani, Picasso, Matisse and Chagall. Jerome K. Ohrbach, of the retailing family, acquired mostly landscapes, still lifes and genre scenes by 19th- and early 20th-century French artists. And Catherine Schlumberger Jones of Washington, an heir to a French fortune in oil-well drilling equipment, focused on Surrealist paintings by Rene Magritte and the Art Brut works of Jean Dubuffet. Sotheby's four-day sale of 370 artworks, estimated to total $198.7 million to $266.6 million, begins at 7 P.M. Monday with its auction of the Ford artworks, valued at $66 million to $86 million. The most important painting, Renoir's ""Cup of Chocolate,"" from 1878, is expected to bring $15 million to $18 million. Owned by the Ford family since 1937, this portrait of a woman in a high-collared black dress pausing over a cup of chocolate was a favorite of the artist. Renoir exhibited the portrait frequently and would not part with it until 1897, when he sold it to his dealer, Galerie Durand-Ruel, which held on to it for 40 years. Two of the more unusual works in the Ford collection are by Picasso: ""Glass of Absinthe,"" a Cubist sculpture from 1912, which is expected to bring $800,000 to $1 million, and ""Bohemian,"" a pastel on paper painted in 1900 in Bareclona, depicting a woman looking out to sea, estimated at $3 million to $4 million. The most important paintings from Garbo's estate, which are to be auctioned at Sotheby's at 7 P.M. on Tuesday, include Renoir's ""Secret"" (estimated at $2 million to $3 million), from 1897; his portrait of his nephew Edmund Renoir, from 1889 ($4 million to $6 million), and Bonnard's ""Corn-Poppies,"" from 1914-15, ($1.5 million to $2 million). This session, expected to total $91 million to $124.6 million, also includes French paintings from the Ohrbach estate (up to $17.9 million) and from the Jones estate (up to $6.8 million). Outstanding among the Jones paintings is Magritte's darkly witty 1951 painting ""Perspective,"" depicting a coffin on a couch, a work based on Jacques-Louis David's portrait of Madame Recamier ($600,000 to $800,000). Both houses are offering an example of Manet's 1882 flower paintings, completed when the artist was in great pain in the last few months before his death from syphilis. The version at Sotheby's in the sale on Tuesday night is a vibrant image of flowers in a round glass vase. The one that Christie's is to auction at 7 P.M. on Wednesday is a muted study of flowers in a rectangular glass vase. The painting bears Manet's dedication to Dr. Thomas W. Evans, a Philadelphia physician, who acquired it from the artist. Christie's two-day sale of 241 works, estimated at $160.6 million to $199.5 million, includes major works by van Gogh, Fernand Leger, Picasso, Chagall, Miro and Alberto Giacometti that have been in private collections for many years. Van Gogh's ""Vase With Cornflowers and Poppies,"" from 1890, a glowing still life in reds, greens, yellow, white and brown painted one month before the artist's suicide, is expected to bring $12 million to $16 million, the highest valuation in Christie's sale. The artist's boldly drawn ""Garden of Flowers,"" from 1888, was executed in brown and black ink over pencil with a reed that van Gogh cut himself. Acquired in 1906 from the widow of the artist's brother, Theo, the drawing changed hands again in 1960 when it was bought by the Swiss father of the present owner, Elizabeth Sigrist-Nathan. The presale estimate is $5 million to $7 million. Two double-sided paintings from before World War I are among the more interesting works in this sale. Leger's abstract landscape ""Houses Beneath the Trees,"" from 1913, a study of interlocking volumes in green, red, blue and gray, is backed by a bolder, darker abstract image in black, red and gray, dominated by a large figure. The presale estimate is $10 million to $12 million. The expressionist style of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner is seen twice in 1912 landscapes -- lovers courting on the front, a Gauguinesque scene on the back. The two-sided work was explained by Michael Findlay, who heads Impressionist and modern-art sales at Christie's. ""Kirchner was still very poor in 1912,"" he said. ""Hence the double painting."" The presale estimate is $800,000 to $1 million. Three offbeat paintings by Miro, Chagall and Picasso, expected to bring $17.5 million to $24.5 million, are being auctioned from an estate that Christie's has not identified. Picasso's ""Woman Resting Before a Mirror,"" from 1932, a sensuous study of a favorite model, is expected to sell for $7 million to $10 million. Chagall's painting ""Drunkard,"" from 1912, combining Cubist imagery and Fauve colors, is expected to sell for $6 million to $8 million. Miro's ""Women Listening to Music,"" from 1945, alive with moving images against a black background, hung in the bar at the Stanhope Hotel in New York in the 1950's when it was in the collection of the hotel's owner, Evelyn Sharpe. The presale estimate is $4.5 million to $6.5 million. Giacometti's soaring bronze sculpture ""Standing Woman No. 1,"" from 1960, a study of an isolated woman, is the second tallest, at more than 105 inches, of the five figures Giacometti submitted in a rejected proposal for One Chase Manhattan Plaza in lower Manhattan. The figure, one of an edition of six, is expected to bring $4 million to $6 million. Contemporary Totals The contemporary-art sales ended late yesterday with totals well below the expectations of the two houses. Of the 379 artworks offered in the two-day sale at Sotheby's, which was expected to bring $59.7 million to $78.4 million, 175 were sold for a total of $27.7 million. At Christie's, in the two-day auction of 313 works, expected to bring $59.9 million to $81.7 million, 157 were sold for a total of $42.3. SOTHEBY'S, York Avenue at 72d Street (212-606-7245).

1990-11-08	Woodworkers Try to Save Rain Forests	"Woodworkers have long lamented the demise of tropical rain forests from hydroelectric development, slash-and-burn agriculture and overharvesting. But Scott Landis, a craftsman in Newtown, Conn., believes woodworkers can play a decisive role in preserving these forests.

Mr. Landis is a founding member of the Wood Workers Alliance for Rain Forest Protection, or WARP, a coalition of furniture makers, musical-instrument builders, wood importers and ecologists. The group encourages the use of wood from well-managed tropical forests with sustainable yields of substitutes for endangered species like mahogany, rosewood, teak or ebony. WARP is planning a conference on the issue Nov. 16-18 at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst."
1990-11-07	Auction of Postwar Art Falls Short of Estimate	"The November art auctions began last night with dealers and collectors watching, not bidding, at Sotheby's in New York in a sale of postwar art at which fewer than half of the works offered -- 34 out of 77 -- were sold. The total for the sale was $19.8 million -- only half of the low end of the house presale estimate. Sotheby's had expected the sale to bring $39.6 million to $52 million. The gallery, packed with dealers and collectors from throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, was extremely quiet through most of the sale. Gasps were heard frequently as John L. Marion, the auctioneer, who is chairman of Sotheby's North America, brought down his hammer firmly on the unsold works, saying ""Passed."" Artists whose works did not sell included many contemporary masters -- Clyfford Still, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Helen Frankenthaler and Hans Hofmann."
1990-11-05	With Ebullience Gone, Auctioneers Are Sober About the Coming Sales	The ebullient mood that characterized art sales throughout the 1980's and as recently as last spring has vanished from the auction rooms at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York. Now auctioneers, art dealers and collectors are taking a sober view of the two-week round of sales of postwar, modern and Impressionist art that begins tomorrow night at Sotheby's.
1990-11-02	Auctions	Two weeks of sales, including Rauschenberg, Dubuffet and Warhol, should reveal the actual state of the market for postwar art. Next week's contemporary-art auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York are considered by auctioneers, dealers, collectors and investors to be the most important test this season of just how healthy the market for postwar art is.
1990-10-26	Auctions	"Poor Results in Two Sales The auction results at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York this week were up one day for jewelry and way down on another day for 19th-century European art. For the first time in years, in fact, dealers described the art sales at the major New York houses as ""disasters."" The numbers were indeed grim: the totals realized for the European art auctions at both Sotheby's and Christie's were about half or one-fourth of what these houses had estimated they would be."

Have the professionals goofed, is the current buoyancy of the art market responsible, are low presale estimates a ploy to attract potential buyers or was it a bidding war between two collectors?
1987-02-13	AUCTIONS	LEAD: ''WHEN the doors were swung back, one was struck by the remarkable smell of 18th-century French morocco,'' Sotheby's medieval-book specialist, Dr. Christopher de Hamel, said in a telephone interview from London, recalling his first trip to one of the world's finest private libraries on hunting, shooting and fishing.

1987-01-22	PASSIONATE COLLECTORS SET NEW AUCTION HIGHS	LEAD: IN 1986, period decorative arts commanded million-dollar prices at auction more often than they ever had before - not once or twice, but six times. Remarkable seven-figure prices were paid for an American table and a wing chair, a German jeweled box, a British silver epergne, a French drop-front secretary and a Chinese porcelain dish.
1987-01-16	AUCTIONS	LEAD: AUCTIONS of corporate art collections, although still few in number, are becoming increasingly important in the 1980's, as values of art and antiques soar and companies expand their investments in both. Corporate holdings are sold for the same reasons that any art collection is dispersed - deaths, partnership changes, financial distress.
1987-01-09	AUCTIONS	LEAD: THE consignment of a late-15th-century work attributed to Botticelli in an Old Masters auction next week at Sotheby's has aroused international interest in the sale and spurred art historians and dealers to ask how much of the painting was actually executed by the Italian artist himself.
1986-12-19	AUCTIONS	ONE of two versions of a letter written by Albert Einstein on Aug. 2, 1939, to President Franklin D. Roosevelt - the letter that sparked the American effort to build the atomic bomb - will be auctioned today at Christie's. The signed, 25-line typewritten document, urging Roosevelt to coordinate research on nuclear energy, is 20 lines shorter than the one hand-delivered to the White House on Oct. 11, 1939. The longer version has been in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park, N.Y., since 1945. Einstein wrote both versions at the instigation of Dr. Leo Szilard, a Hungarian-born physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb. In his hand-penned note to Dr. Szilard in German - which will accompany the letter up for sale - Einstein said he preferred that the longer, more detailed version be sent. The shorter letter remained in Dr. Szilard's family after his death in 1964, and was acquired recently by another owner, the consignor, who has not been identified. Christie's estimates the letter will sell for $60,000 to $80,000.
1986-12-12	Auctions	THE Duchess of Windsor's collection of magnificent jewelry will be auctioned in Geneva in April, John L. Marion, Sotheby's chairman in the United States, announced yesterday. He said it was ''coincidental'' that the announcement was made 50 years to the day after the King of England abdicated his throne to make ''the woman I love'' his wife. The Duke of Windsor and Wallis Warfield Simpson, the socialite from Baltimore who became the Duchess of Windsor, were married later, on June 3, 1937. The collection of 230 lots, valued by Sotheby's at more than $7 million, includes 87 pieces by Cartier and 23 by Van Cleef and Arpels, with many of the most important pieces designed in the 1930's and 1950's by the two houses. ''There are no tiaras,'' Nicholas Rayner, the chairman of Sotheby's in Geneva, said by telephone from Paris, adding that the collection was a well-balanced mix of earrings, necklaces, bracelets, brooches and rings.
1986-12-11	A REMBRANDT PORTRAIT SELLS FOR $10.3 MILLION IN LONDON	Rembrandt's ''Portrait of a Young Girl Wearing a Gold-Trimmed Cloak'' from 1632, was auctioned yesterday for a record price at Sotheby's in London. The signed and dated painting on a wood panel was sold for $10.3 million to a buyer who was not identified. The American owners had consigned the work immediately after they were notified in September by the Rembrandt Research Project of Amsterdam that its authenticity had been reaffirmed. The owners decided to sell the work before Jan. 1, when the capital-gains tax goes from 20 to 28 percent.
1986-12-05	AUCTIONS	ONE Saturday in September 1985, Ted Seaton, a British antiques dealer, took his metal detector on his usual weekend treasure hunt into the meadows of North Yorkshire. This time, Mr. Seaton and two friends focused their search on a field about 200 yards from Middleham Castle. There Mr. Seaton struck gold, unearthing a 15th-century diamond-shaped gold pendant, measuring 2 1/2 inches high and 2 inches wide, embellished on the front with a large sapphire and engraved with religious images - the Trinity is depicted on the front, the Nativity on the back. Following some publicity about the extraordinary discovery, an inquest was conducted to determine whether the pendant was from any known collection. When no owner was found, the piece, known as the Middleham Jewel, was returned to Mr. Seaton, who with four partners - his two companions, the man who holds the lease on the field and the man who owns the property - sent the pendant to Sotheby's in London, where it will be auctioned next Thursday.
1986-12-04	Lewis Carroll Drawings Bring a Record Price	Nine drawings from ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' that were identified recently by a New York book dealer as copies made by Lewis Carroll of John Tenniel illustrations were sold yesterday at Sotheby's in London for a record at auction for a children's manuscript. The captioned pen-and-ink sketches were acquired by an American collector who was not identified for $267,410.
1986-12-03	Braque Painting Sells for $9.5 Million	Georges Braque's ''Woman Reading'' (1911), the artist's largest Cubist painting at 51 inches high by 32 inches wide, was sold yesterday at Sotheby's in London for $9.5 million, the highest price paid at auction for a 20th-century painting. An oil on canvas in murky tones of gray, brown, beige and black, the painting is a study of scrolls, columns, blocks and soaring triangles.
1986-11-25	NEOLITHIC CARVING SOLD FOR A RECORD AT AUCTION	A 6,000-year-old neolithic sculpture of a seated goddess - at eight inches tall, one of the largest known - was sold yesterday for the highest price ever paid at auction for an antiquity. The gray-white marble figure, dating from about 4000 B.C., was auctioned at Sotheby's from the estate of James Johnson Sweeney, art historian and museum director, in a bidding duel between two major antiquities collectors. The carving was sold for $1.32 million - more than 20 times Sotheby's most optimistic expectations - to Shelby White Levy, a financial writer who is the wife of Leon Levy, a Wall Street financier.
1986-11-21	AUCTIONS	AN extraordinary eight-inch-tall gray-white marble neolithic goddess - a majestic seated figure with the right leg folded over the left and the hands meeting under the breast - will be auctioned from the collection of the estate of James Johnson Sweeney, the art historian and museum director, on Monday at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. The small figure, which has an encrustation of lime, is one of several important works in the antiquities sale taking place at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. Small though it may be, according to Prof. Saul Weinberg, a historian at the University of Missouri, a marble neolithic sculpture taller than four inches is extremely rare. Although Sotheby's describes the ancient figure in its catalogue as a Cycladic marble goddess of the middle neolithic period, circa 5000-3500 B.C., Professor Weinberg said that in his opinion, the work is not Cycladic. He was interviewed this week by telephone from Columbia, Mo., where he is director emeritus of the university's Museum of Art and Archeology and professor emeritus of its department of art history and archeology.
1986-11-19	MONDRIAN PAINTING IS AUCTIONED FOR RECORD PRICE	Mondrian's ''Composition in a Square With Red Corner,'' the artist's largest complete painting, sold last night at Sotheby's for an auction record for a work by the artist and the second-highest price for a 20th-century painting. The diamond-shaped Abstract painting - a white oil on canvas defined by a grid of black bars and one small red triangle - sold for $5.06 million. The work measures almost 5 feet diagonally. The buyer, who bid from the rear of the room, said his name was Richard Pichler, but would not further identify himself before he quickly left the gallery. According to Sotheby's, Mr. Pichler is an international dealer. The price made the painting the second most expensive 20th-century artwork ever auctioned, exceeded only by ''Yo: Picasso,'' a self-portrait that was auctioned in 1981 at Sotheby's for $5.83 million.
1986-11-18	LEONARDO'S 'CHILD WITH A LAMB' SELLS FOR RECORD	Leonardo da Vinci's ''Child With a Lamb,'' one of very few works by the artist in private hands, was sold last night for a record at auction for an artwork by the artist, and the highest auction price in America for an Old Master drawing. Leonardo's pen and brown-ink drawing - three sketches of a child hugging a lamb fill one side of the 5-by-8-inch piece of paper, with the head of an old man, some machinery and mirror writing on the other side - dates from 1500-1506. It brought $3.6 million and was the most important work in the record-breaking sale of Rembrandt-through-Redon drawings at Sotheby's from the collection of John Ryan Gaines, a director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Adrian Ward Jackson, the London dealer, was the buyer, bidding for the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.
1986-11-14	AUCTIONS	OLD MASTER prints - Rembrandts, Durers, Van Dykes and Piranesis - will be auctioned next week at Sotheby's and Christie's in sales that offer an unusual bounty of works by these and other artists. The sales come less than a year after the Duke of Devonshire sold 300 Old Master prints from the Chatsworth Collection in a landmark auction last December at Christie's in London. Jennifer Josselson, Christie's prints specialist in New York, said that at the Chatsworth sale ''the majority of the buyers were American collectors, dealers and institutions.'' Since extraordinary prices often attract similar material of the same or lesser quality to the auction market, next week's sales come as no surprise to collectors and dealers. The sale at Christie's, Park Avenue at 59th Street, takes place next Wednesday at 10 A.M. and will present 127 prints. Sotheby's sale of 75 prints at its gallery, York Avenue at 72d Street, is Thursday at 10 A.M.
1986-11-13	'78 WORK BY BACON IS SOLD	Francis Bacon's ''Seated Figure,'' a 1978 painting showing two men -one crouching, one in profile in suit and tie against a gloriously colored background - was sold last night at Christie's for the highest price at auction ever achieved for a work by the British artist. The painting, one of the artist's favorites, was the most important of 10 works from the 20th-century art collection of Ted Ashley, the 64-year-old Warner Communications executive. It was purchased by a collector who was not identified for $935,000, almost double the previous record at auction for the artist, which was $517,000, the price paid in 1985 at Sotheby's for ''Landscape Near Malabata, Tangiers.'' Pop Art Works Bidding was brisk on the Bacon and on two record-breaking Pop Art works consigned by Mr. Ashley, who is selling, according to Martha Baer, Christie's specialist in postwar art, because he ''is going on to a different phase in his personal life.'' Roy Lichtenstein's ''Blang'' from 1962 was sold for $792,000 to Thomas Ammann, a Zurich dealer, eclipsing the previous record of $522,500 paid for ''Reclining Nude,'' in May 1985 at Sotheby's. And Claes Oldenburg's ''Girls' Dresses Blowing in the Wind,'' from 1961, was purchased by a New York dealer who was not identified for $203,500, blotting out the previous high of $181,500 paid for the artist's ''Typewriter Eraser,'' in 1984 at Sotheby's.
1986-11-12	RESENQUIST PAINTING SELLS FOR RECORD PRICE	James Rosenquist's ''F-111'' painting - the largest artwork ever auctioned - was sold last night for almost 100 times the price paid to the artist when it was acquired in 1965 by the Robert C. Sculls. The painting, one of 44 artworks auctioned from the Scull collection, was among nine that established records at auction for artists in a sale that brought the highest total for a single-owner collection of post-World War II art. Mr. Rosenquist was in the room last night for the sale of his painting, which was sold for $2,090,000, and recalled later that he had been paid $22,500 for the work. Jeffrey Deitsch of Citibank, who made the winning bid on the enormous painting - it measures 10 feet high and 85 feet long - would not reveal for whom he was bidding. Thomas Armstrong, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, a disappointed underbidder, lowered his paddle after his bid of $1.1 million was exceeded.
1986-11-11	JASPER JOHNS PAINTING BRINGS RECORD PRICE	Jasper Johns's boldly colored and Expressionistic ''Out the Window,'' from 1959, was sold last night for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by a living artist and for a post-World War II painting. The spirited bidding on the exuberant work, which combines encaustic (melted wax and pigment) with newspaper collage, sparked applause throughout Sotheby's gallery when the chairman, John L. Marion, brought down his hammer. It was sold for $3.63 million to an unidentified buyer who bid over the telephone. ''I'm exhausted. Emotionally exhausted,'' Ethel Redner Scull said after the sale of her painting - the favorite, she said, of the nine works she had consigned to the sale. ''It is wonderful that it brought a record price, but I am devastated at losing it.''
1986-11-07	AUCTIONS	POSTWAR art acquired in an extremely public way by Ethel Redner Scull and Robert C. Scull, the taxi tycoon, and in a private way by Ted Ashley, vice chairman of Warner Communications, will be auctioned next week at Sotheby's and Christie's. The sales will present the largest number of major works by Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, George Segal and Francis Bacon ever offered at auction. The combined value of the Pop, Minimalist and Abstract Expressionist works up for sale at Sotheby's is between $15 million and $19 million for 410 offerings. Christie's will offer 254 works valued at between $5.6 million and $7.4 million.
1986-11-06	AUCTION REVEALS DISPUTE BY ARTIST AND AN EX-BACKER	A two-year-old dispute between Robert Rauschenberg, the artist, and Frederick R. Weisman, a Los Angeles businessman and art collector, became public this week when art dealers and collectors realized Mr. Weisman had consigned nine works by the artist to Sotheby's to be sold without having a floor price below which they would not be sold. ''The big question is why does he dump all these Rauschenbergs,'' Leo Castelli, Mr. Rauschenberg's dealer, asked. ''At best it's vindictive,'' Mr. Rauschenberg said in a statement issued through Terry Van Brunt, his assistant.
1986-11-04	SHAKESPEARE NOTES FOUND	A notebook found with the stored underclothes of an aristocratic English family contains the earliest known extracts from William Shakespeare's work, Sotheby's reported yesterday. The notes apparently were jotted down by a theatergoer in about 1600, said Roy Davids, manuscript expert at the London auction house.
1986-10-31	AUCTIONS	THE Museum of Modern Art will auction 17 duplicate prints from its photography holdings - the first public sale of such works from the museum's collection - at Christie's on Nov. 11. John Szarkowski, director of the Modern's department of photography, said each of the prints is ''of excellent quality and represents an important work in the history of photography.'' Eugene Atget is represented with 10 views of Paris and environs from the 1920's and Alfred Stieglitz with two turn-of-the-century large format photogravures - a look at Manhattan's Flatiron Building and ''Spring Showers, New York.'' There is a 1932 portrait of Picasso by Man Ray; ''Bucks County Barn,'' from 1915, by Charles Sheeler, and two works by Edward Weston, a 1936 ''Nude'' (of Charis on the dunes) and a 1921 study of Max Eastman on a beach, done in collaboration with Margrethe Mather. Mr. Szarkowski explained why the museum chose to auction some of its holdings. ''In the old days when the market value of photos was very slight, it was easier to arrange a trade with another institution without worrying about whether one was exercising fiduciary responsibility,'' he said. ''It wasn't as great a worry when the pictures were worth $50 and $60.'' The photographs in the sale are expected to sell for $2,000 to $18,000 each.
1986-10-30	JEFFERSON LETTER BRINGS RECORD PRICE	A letter Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1818 to a Jewish diplomat and journalist in which the former President condemned prejudice towards Jews and all religious intolerance was sold yesterday at Sotheby's for the highest price ever paid at auction for any letter or any Presidential document. According to dealers at the sale, the letter was purchased for $396,000 by Ludwig Jesselson, the 75-year-old retired chairman of Philipp Brothers Inc., metal traders. The German-born Mr. Jesselson is a major collector of Judaica.
1986-10-27	1818 JEFFERSON LETTER TO BE AUCTIONED	A letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1818 to a Jewish diplomat and journalist in New York, in which the former President condemned prejudice toward Jews and reiterated his distaste for religious intolerance, will be auctioned by Sotheby's on Wednesday. Writing from Monticello, his home near Charlottesville, Va., in response to a letter from Mordecai Noah, who sent the former President a copy of his speech at the consecration of Congregation Shearith Israel, Jefferson - whose letter reveals the author's tolerance even toward punctuation -said: ''I have read it with pleasure and instruction, having learnt from it some valuable facts in Jewish history which I did not know before. your sect by it's sufferings has furnished a remarkable proof of the universal spirit of religious intolerance, inherent in every sect, disclaimed by all while feeble, and practised by all when in power. our laws have applied the only antidote to this vice, protecting our religious, as they do our civil rights by putting all on an equal footing. but more remains to be done.'' For about 50 years the original letter has been in the possession of a private collector, Charles J. Rosenbloom of Pittsburgh. A copy is in the Library of Congress. ''But the letter has been lost sight of, allowed to sink into obscurity,'' said Ruth Lester, assistant editor of the Jefferson papers at Princeton University.
1986-10-27	EARLY REMBRANDT WORK TO BE SOLD BY SOTHBY'S	A major, early Rembrandt painting - ''Portrait of a Young Girl Wearing a Gold-Trimmed Cloak'' from 1632 -will be auctioned by Sotheby's in London on Dec. 10, the time and place determined in part because of the United States tax reform bill that takes effect Jan. 1. The owners of the oval painting on a wood panel - which is signed and dated and depicts a young woman with full cheeks and wispy blond hair - decided to sell after they were notified last month by the Rembrandt Research Project of Amsterdam that its authenticity had been reaffirmed. They then decided to dispose of the work before the capital gains tax goes from 20 to 28 percent. 'Wanted 1986 Transaction' ''It is being sold now for tax reasons - we wanted to have a 1986 transaction,'' said Jonathan Phillips, of the Fiduciary Trust Company of Boston, who represents the owners.
1986-10-22	A Rare Ruby Auctioned For Record $1.5 Million	A rare, 15-carat Burmese ruby was auctioned at Sotheby's yesterday for $1.54 million, a world record for a colored stone sold at public sale.
1986-10-17	THE EVENING HOURS	''I'M here to make sure no one walks away with the art,'' said Michael L. Ainslie, the president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. Alexandra Daly, a student at Barnard College, wasn't sure why she was there. ''Someone told me this party was raising money for face lifts,'' she said. ''That's not true, is it?'' It wasn't. The beneficiary of the Palm Beach Ball on Tuesday night was the National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, which treats people with facial deformities. About 360 people attended the second annual black-tie dinner dance in Sotheby's main auction room.
1986-10-17	AUCTIONS	IN early July, jewelry dealers, investors and collectors - from London, Paris, Geneva, Antwerp, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and throughout the United States - began filing past the guards and television cameras that monitor Christie's and Sotheby's private viewing rooms in their jewelry departments. By Labor Day, the parade of potential bidders was relentlessly steady. And until the auctions Monday through Wednesday, the gem offerings at these galleries are expected to attract crowds that may outdo Tiffany's at Christmas. The word was out several months earlier than usual this year that both houses had some impressive stones among the hundreds of selections in their sales, each of which are expected to total more than $10 million. Coincidentally, both establishments have jewelry purchased by the heirs to fortunes made at the turn of the century in street-railway operations.
1986-10-03	AUCTIONS	THE largest auction in New York of Viennese decorative arts dating from 1900 to 1930 will be held Oct. 11 at 2 P.M. at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. The 135 works up for bidding include furniture, silver, glass, jewelry and posters by most of the major architects, designers and artists of the period - Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, Oskar Kokoschka, Otto Wagner and Dagobert Peche. The sale includes many designs that are the same as or similar to those featured in the Museum of Modern Art's ''Vienna 1900: Art, Architecture and Design,'' which closes Oct. 22, and in the American Federation of Art's ''Bentwood and Metal Furniture: 1850-1946,'' which opened this week at the I.B.M. Galleries of Science and Art, Madison Avenue at 56th Street, and runs through Nov. 1. Architect-designed furniture, the most popular area in Austrian modern for today's collectors, is well represented in this sale, with many examples of hat racks, mirrors, benches, armoires, screens, tables and chairs. An example of the writing table Otto Wagner designed for Vienna's Postal Savings Bank, with aluminum socks and studs, may sell for up to $50,000. A chair and stool from the same Wagner collection will also be offered, with the chair expected to sell for as much as $10,000 and the stool up to $6,000.
1986-09-26	AUCTIONS	CHRISTIE'S first auction of modern American designs, presenting 200 works dating from 1920 to 1960 by many of the period's most important architects and industrial designers, is being held this weekend. The sale is filled with many designs that are the same as or similar to those seen last year at the Whitney Museum of American Art in ''High Styles: 20th-Century American Design'' and those that will be included in the Brooklyn Museum's ''Machine Age in America, 1918-1941,'' which opens Oct. 17. The auction items are by such notables as Norman Bel Geddes, Walter Dorwin Teague, Gilbert Rohde, Charles Eames, Eero Saarinen and Florence Knoll. All but 23 of the most important selections will be auctioned at 2 P.M. today at Christie's East, 219 East 67th Street. The remainder will be offered at 3:30 P.M. tomorrow at Christie's main galleries, Park Avenue and 59th Street, after its sale of mostly European 20th-century decorative arts.
1986-09-19	AUCTIONS	AFTER Gerrit Thomas Rietveld's innovative de Stijl furniture was sold for record prices at an Amsterdam auction by Christie's in May, an even larger group of the Dutch architect's work was assembled by Sotheby's for another sale scheduled in that city on Sept. 29 and 30. This time there will be 12 lots, comprising 26 Rietveld designs - twice the number auctioned in May. ''Everybody thought that very few pieces survive of Rietveld's furniture,'' Willem de Winter, Sotheby's specialist in 20th-century decorative arts, said this week by telephone from Amsterdam. He explained that most of Rietveld's work was produced in limited quantities - and that no one knows how many pieces still exist. It was the widely publicized results of Christie's auction, he added, that made owners of this furniture aware of the demand for the works of Rietveld, who, with Piet Mondrian, helped develop de Stijl's advanced ideas of abstraction in design and art. ''Now, we know there are some collections extant that no one knew about,'' he said.
1986-09-09	SCULLS' ART TO BE SOLD AT AUCTION	Pop and Minimal art collected in the 1960's by Ethel Redner Scull and Robert C. Scull, the taxi tycoon, will be auctioned in separate sessions on Nov. 10 and 11, Sotheby's said yesterday. The Sculls were flamboyant in their collecting, buying art in a public way and entertaining lavishly. They amassed one of the first major collections of 1960's art. The Sculls divorced in 1974 and were in court on and off over the next 11 years over the division of the art they had collected during their 30-year marriage. In March 1985, Mrs. Scull was awarded 35 percent of the Scull artworks by a decision in the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court. The actual division of the art did not take place until after Mr. Scull's death at the age of 70, last Jan. 1. Mrs. Scull has appealed the court's award to her and is asking for 50 percent. Her appeal is to be heard next month. All parties to the auction say they have agreed that these legal moves will not affect the sale.
1986-09-04	COURT RULES ON DISPUTED JUDAICA	A consortium of leading Jewish scholarly institutions will receive a collection of rare Jewish books and manuscripts that was auctioned at Sotheby's in 1984 and later recalled, the New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, announced yesterday. The books and manuscripts were returned after Mr. Abrams sued the auction house, charging it with ''persistent fraud and illegality'' in the sale. Under a court order signed by Justice Robert E. White of State Supreme Court, the disputed manuscripts will be given to the Judaica Conservancy Foundation, whose members are the Jewish Theological Seminary and Yeshiva University in New York City; the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati; the Hebrew University in Jerusalem; the Leo Baeck Institute in New York City, and the Leo Baeck College in London.
1986-08-29	Museums' Art On The Block	WHILE much attention has been paid over the last several years to the architectural endeavors of museums across the country, curators and boards of trustees have been busy reviewing more than facades and floor plans. Indeed, buying and selling holdings is a routine part of museum life. And recently the number of works from museum collections coming up at auction has increased significantly. Last season, for example, Christie's sold about 1,000 lots from 37 institutions amounting to $6.4 million, nearly double its figure from the previous year. At Sotheby's, last spring's sales alone totaled $7.8 million of deaccessioned works (art removed from a museum collection in order to sell it) from such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago.
1986-08-22	AUCTIONS	PRIZED items in this fast-growing field of antiques include Strength Testers, Flip-Card Machines and Wheels of Fortune, and posters advertising such unforgettable sights as the Dog Child, the Gay Deceiver and Hugo the Blood-Sweating Hippopotamus from the River Nile. The field is circus memorabilia, or to use the broader term, ''fairground art.'' Virtually nonexistent only 10 years ago, the market is brisk today for a wide range of 19th- and early to middle 20th-century antiques from the amusement parks, traveling fairs and circuses that were once an entertainment staple across America. Carved wooden animals - especially carousel animals and those taken from old circus wagons - are the highest-priced objects in the field. But circus posters, sideshow banners, penny-arcade games and small-scale models or dioramas are also consistently in demand.
1986-08-08	AUCTIONS	EVEN the auction catalogue had to call the item ''unusual.'' It consisted of the natural head of a fox, right down to the whiskers, although the eyes were glass. The head was mounted on a silver cup with a scrolled handle topped by a silver cluster of grapes. At Christie's Fine English and Continental Silver auction last year, the work carried an estimated value of $1,000 to $1,500. But the bidding never got over $850. In the words of the auction trade, the item - listed in the catalogue as ''An Unusual Victorian Silver-Mounted Fox Mask Stirrup Cup, London, 1857'' - was ''bought in,'' temporarily acquired by the gallery in a transaction where no money changed hands. What happens to items that do not sell at auction? ''One of two things,'' said Fritz Hatton, senior vice president for operations at Christie's. ''Either the work is returned to the consignor or offered in a subsequent sale.''
1986-08-01	AUCTIONS	THE decline of the dollar against foreign currencies over the last year had a major impact on art-auction sales worldwide, and helped swell totals to record levels in this period, according to spokesmen at Sotheby's and Christie's, which issued preliminary sales figures yesterday for the 12-month season ending Aug. 31. Sotheby's announced that it estimates a total of $691.5 million, compared with $642.2 million a year ago. When translated into pounds, however, Sotheby's sales total would show a decline to $:473.3 million, from $:502.2 million. Christie's totals are estimated to increase to $536.8 million, up from $475.9 million. In pounds, the sales figures are expected to rise to $:365.2 million, up from $:337.5 million a year ago.
1986-07-25	AUCTIONS	PALACE-QUALITY French furnishings, European and English silver and Old-Master paintings from the collection of Antenor Patino, the Bolivian tin magnate, will be auctioned in New York by Sotheby's and Christie's in three sales this fall and winter. Most of the 319 artworks and antiques in these sales, which are expected to total about $7 million, were assembled by Mr. Patino, a businessman and diplomat who served as the Bolivian Government's representative to Britain in the 1930's. He died at the age of 85 in 1982. Twelve of the French 18th-century furnishings in Sotheby's sale belong to other members of the Patino family, none of whom have been identified by the auction house.
1986-07-11	AUCTIONS	IN 1949, Tadeus Altounyan, a British oil company executive, was traveling in Aden (now Yemen) when he heard of an Arab tribesman who had a ''very old thing - a created person'' in his possession. The bedouin was not eager to sell what proved to be a 7-inch-tall bronze statuette of an ancient Spartan warrior, Mr. Altounyan recalled recently by telephone from his home in Hythe, Kent. But he persuaded the man to exchange it for its weight in silver - then worth about $60 or $70. ''I was rather doubtful that I hadn't paid him too much,'' Mr. Altounyan said, adding that he had no idea what the figure actually was worth. ''It was obviously something that should be rescued from oblivion.''
1986-06-27	AUCTIONS	TWO James Bond cars from ''Goldfinger,'' a gingham pinafore worn by Judy Garland in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' and Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat and cane are among the movie memorabilia that will be auctioned tomorrow and next month in sales in New York and London. The Bond vehicles - a silver Aston Martin that Sean Connery drove and a black and yellow Rolls-Royce that he chased in ''Goldfinger'' - have been stopping traffic this week in front of Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. Both will be auctioned there tomorrow at the end of an all-day sale of collectibles that will include Hollywood props and costumes, rock-and-roll memorabilia, Walt Disney celluloids, carrousel carvings, vintage dolls and music boxes. The sessions are at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. The Aston Martin DB-5, a tour de force of high-powered gadgetry, became coveted by car buffs after the film's release in 1964. There were machine guns concealed behind the front parking lights, a bulletproof shield covering the rear window, devices that emitted smoke screens, oil slicks and tacks from the tail section, bumpers extending pneumatically to ram approaching vehicles, and a pilot-type ejector seat to propel unwanted passengers skyward.
1986-06-13	AUCTIONS	EVER since quartz wristwatches began upstaging windups in jewelry shops and department stores over the last decade, prices have escalated on period mechanical versions sold in antiques shops and at auction. Wristwatches have been offered regularly at auctions since 1980. Over the last year, prices for extraordinary examples have doubled, spurring, in turn, unusual activity at auctions in Geneva and New York. Last month, watch buyers attending Christie's sale in Geneva paid record prices for several important selections. And next week, hundreds of vintage watches by the major producers - Patek Philippe, Vacheron & Constantin, Rolex, Le Coultre, Audemars Piguet, Omega, Longines-Wittnauer and Cartier - will be offered in three sales at New York's auction houses - Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, Son & Neale.
1986-06-06	AUCTIONS	AMERICAN architectural designs by Frank Lloyd Wright, Charles and Henry Greene and George Grant Elmslie are collected these days as seriously as is 18th-century furniture. Since 1982, when Christie's in New York began auctioning the early 20th-century furniture, stained-glass windows and accessories designed by these architects, the market for such material has blossomed and prices have steadily edged upward. This activity has attracted other rarities to auctions and made similar designs by craftsmen of the period, including Gustav Stickley and Harvey Ellis, far more desirable and expensive. As prices escalate, it seems, more designs, including some works never auctioned until now, are surfacing in much the same way as did the designs of Louis Comfort Tiffany when there was a boom in Art Nouveau works a decade ago. In Christie's sale of 20th-century decorative arts, next Friday at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. in its main gallery, Park Avenue at 59th Street, 15 architectural designs and a score of works by Stickley and Ellis will be offered at the beginning of the afternoon session. For the third time in 18 months, the auction house will sell one of Frank Lloyd Wright's spherical copper urns. About a dozen of these imposing, 18-inch-diameter vessels were made by James A. Miller for the architect's turn-of-the-century houses, in which he used them to decorate newel posts and dining tables.
1986-05-31	Egyptian Sculpture Sets Record High at Auction	A monumental ancient Egyptian sculpture of the lioness-headed goddess Sekhmet of Memphis was sold at Sotheby's yesterday from the estate of John Lennon for $742,500, a record at auction for Egyptian art that doubled the previous high. The two-ton stone enthroned figure - it is almost 7 feet tall - believed to have been made for the Temple of Mut in Thebes during the reign of Amenhotep III (1403 to 1365 B.C.), is one of only a few colossal Egyptian statues to be auctioned.
1986-05-30	AUCTIONS	THOUSANDS of collectors, dealers and the merely curious have traveled this week by car, train and helicopter to view the extraordinary contents of West Dean, an 11th-century castle in Sussex, south of London, where Christie's will hold a five-day auction of the Edward James collection next Monday through Friday. The bizarre and beautiful artworks and furnishings up for bidding - 2,679 offerings valued at about $4 million -were inherited or acquired by Mr. James, a collector of Surrealist art who was the heir to several American fortunes in lumber, metals, mining and railroads. At his death at the age of 77 in 1984, virtually all of his estate was bequeathed to the Edward James Foundation, which manages West Dean College, a school of crafts and conservation.
1986-05-30	'Manifesto,' From 1848, Is Sold for $39,811	An 1848 copy of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels's ''Communist Manifesto'' was sold Wednesday at Sotheby's in London for $39,811, to the Valmadonna Trust, a private British collection of Hebrew and Jewish books and manuscripts. Described by the auction house as ''insignificant looking,'' - the front cover is missing - the German-language work is one of 11 copies of the first edition's second issue that survive.
1986-05-23	AUCTIONS	A MONUMENTAL ancient Egyptian sculpture of the lioness-headed goddess Sekhmet of Memphis, acquired in the mid-1970's by John Lennon, who placed it in the garden of his home in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., will be auctioned from his estate next Friday at Sotheby's. Believed to have been made for the Temple of Mut in Thebes during the reign of Amenhotep III (1403-1365 B.C.), the enthroned figure is one of very few colossal Egyptian works to be auctioned in recent memory, according to Richard M. Keresey, Sotheby's antiquities specialist. The scale and completeness of the seated, two-ton figure - it is almost seven feet tall and of a granite-like stone called syenite - has aroused extraordinary interest. The statue is expected to sell for $400,000 to $600,000, establishing a record for Egyptian art. To date, the highest price paid at auction for Egyptian art is $341,000, the figure reached in a 1983 Sotheby's sale of a granite statue of Merneptah, a 19th-Dynasty figure.
1986-05-16	AUCTIONS	POLITICAL and economic problems throughout Latin America are creating a mixed market for its 20th-century art, at least 50 percent of which is traditionally collected by native Latin Americans. The auctions next week at Sotheby's and Christie's are not expected to reverse this trend, but they may indicate whether major Latin American works continue to command top prices and who is buying the moderate-priced paintings, drawings and sculpture. ''There continues to be a strong buying public for very expensive works, but the middle-class Latin American buyers have disappeared,'' Mary-Anne Martin, a dealer in the field, said. ''They were the hardest hit by the devaluation of currencies. Now they are slowly being replaced by American buyers.''
1986-05-14	RECORD SALE FOR LAUTREC'S 'OPERA BALL'	Toulouse-Lautrec's ''Opera Ball,'' a festive scene in glowing yellows, blacks and whites painted in 1893, brought the highest price in Sotheby's auction of Impressionist and modern works last night. The radiant work, executed in thinned oils, charcoal and gouache on paper, shows the celebrated dancer Jane Avril from the back, in conversation with the artist's bearded friend Maurice Guibert, a representative of Moet & Chandon champagne. After spirited bidding that characterized most of the auction, the painting was sold for $2.86 million, almost double the house's expectations, to a European dealer who was not identified.
1986-05-09	TROVES OF TREASURE AT THE AUCTION HOUSES	AUCTION-HOUSE browsing, one of the most popular rites of springtime in New York, is expected to hit its peak this weekend when there are more exhibitions and sales of art, prints, photographs, books, Oriental rugs, classic cars and collectibles than at any other time during the year. Several major Modiglianis, Magrittes and Moores are among the highlights in the exhibitions of Impressionist and modern artworks at the city's two top auction houses. These works and scores of others valued at a total of more than $60 million will be auctioned next week. Modigliani's ''Portrait of Annie Bjarne,'' showing a young Swedish woman the artist met at a Parisian cafe in 1919, is the most important painting in Sotheby's dispersal of 72 artworks Tuesday night at 7 at its galleries, York Avenue at 72d Street. The red-haired, unsmiling Miss Bjarne is depicted with haunting wistfulness - one eye blue, the other brown, her shoulders slumped in a dark gray dress - against a deep red background.
1986-05-02	AUCTIONS	JASPER JOHNS'S ''Target,'' a 1961 version in red, yellow and blue of one of the artist's favorite early icons, is the most important of a number of major Pop Art and Abstract Expressionist works going on view today before their sale next week at Christie's and Sotheby's. Mr. Johns's painting of a bull's-eye, from the period when he was also executing images of flags, numbers and alphabets, is expected to sell for $2 million, which would be the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by a living artist. The painting, which has hung since 1978 at the Art Institute of Chicago, on loan from its owner, who has not been identified, will be auctioned Tuesday at 7 P.M. at Christie's, Park Avenue at 59th Street. The sale of 64 artworks valued at $6.6 million to $7.7 million also includes 21 sculptures - one of the largest of such artworks ever offered at auction. Outstanding among them is David Smith's 1963 welded-steel ''Voltri-Bolton XXIII,'' one of 25 works from this series, which was given by the artist to its owner -Sarah Dora Greenberg, daughter of the art critic Clement Greenberg -when she was 1 year old. Christie's expects the rod-and-disk work, suggesting a person half sitting, half standing, to sell for $1 million.
1986-04-25	AUCTIONS	WILL a 1931 Bugatti bring more at auction than a Botticelli? Can a Frank Stella design on a BMW command as high a price as the artist's acrylics on canvas? How much will a James Bond pedigree add to the value of an Aston Martin and a Rolls-Royce when these cars from the film ''Goldfinger'' come up for bidding? These are some of the questions being posed as the season's automobile auctions move into high gear, with three major events scheduled over the next two months. The action begins May 10 with the offering of 120 sporting and racing cars valued at $10 million, in a sale organized by Guernsey's, the specialty auction house.
1986-04-24	Art by Fonda	Henry Fonda's paintings look, well, like Henry Fonda - worn elegance, crisp precision, slightly ascetic. Two signed lithographs fetched $1,600 on Tuesday night at Sotheby's during a benefit auction for Very Special Arts, which supports arts for the handicapped.
1986-04-18	AUCTIONS	WILLIAM DOYLE was busy on the telephone on Jan. 23, taking calls from people seeking his ''broom-clean'' service that he developed to help those involved in liquidating estates. This specialty of William Doyle Galleries aids clients seeking to swiftly clear homes of art, antiques and less valuable possessions, including used clothing, pots and pans and secondhand furniture. Mr. Doyle said he does about 1,000 sweeps a year and considers the service one of the galleries' major functions. At 2:05 P.M. that day, the lawyer for the estate of Mary Crocker Alexander Whitehouse, widow of Sheldon Whitehouse, a career diplomat, called to make an appointment with the auctioneer to appraise the contents of Mrs. Whitehouse's 20-room Fifth Avenue home. She had died the day before at the age of 90. ''We knew the family - her son had bought a sideboard that week,'' Mr. Doyle recalled.
1986-04-11	AUCTIONS	A CARTIER mystery clock that experts say once belonged to Eva Peron will be auctioned on Tuesday at Christie's, Park Avenue at 59th Street. The clock was purchased by a Philadelphia jeweler in 1958 at a sale in Buenos Aires conducted by the Argentine Government. One of only two such 8-inch-tall table clocks made by Cartier in 1947, it has a secret mechanism hidden in two lapis-lazuli-embellished columns that frame its octagonal face. The mechanism makes the rock-crystal dial and the diamond-studded arrow-shaped hands rotate, seemingly with no visible attachment.
1986-02-28	AUCTIONS	SOTHEBY'S annual auction of moderate-priced Old Master and modern prints, in which about half the offerings are odd lots of 2 to 44 items, will be held next Thursday and Friday at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. This sale is not for the timid; it is aimed at collectors and dealers who seek offbeat works, some by minor artists, and who are willing to take a chance on engravings and lithographs that may require extensive restoration. Unlike Sotheby's major print sales, in which only about 10 percent of the lots up for bidding are in such groupings, these odd-lot sales do not itemize every etching, woodcut or silkscreen offered. The number of prints in each group is noted in parentheses at the end of the catalogue description. When the number is only approximate, it will appear as ''(c. 44),'' meaning circa, or about, 44 prints.
1986-02-21	AUCTIONS	TWO classic cars from the James Bond film ''Goldfinger'' - a silver Aston Martin that Sean Connery drove and a black and yellow Rolls-Royce he chased - will be auctioned June 28 at Sotheby's. The Aston Martin DB-5, a tour-de-force of high-powered gadgetry, became one of the most coveted by car buffs after the film's release in 1964, according to Dana Hawkes, Sotheby's collectibles specialist. The car reportedly cost about $40,000 to build in 1963, three times what Aston Martins were selling for then, because of the special gadgets ordered by Eon Productions for Secret Agent 007's adventures. There were machine guns concealed behind the front parking lights, a bulletproof shield covering the rear window, devices that emitted smoke screens, oil slicks and tacks from the tail section, bumpers extending pneumatically to ram approaching vehicles, and a pilot-type ejector seat to propel unwanted passengers skyward.
1986-02-06	SOTHEBY'S PLANS $70 MILLION ADDITION	Sotheby's said yesterday that it was planning to add a 27-story apartment tower to its four-story New York headquarters at York Avenue at 72d Street. The $70 million expansion, designed by Michael Graves, the Princeton, N.J., architect, would begin construction in a year if approved by the city's Planning Commission and Board of Estimate.
1986-01-24	AUCTIONS	SUCH unusual pieces of Americana as a cigar-store Indian Princess, a pair of early-18th-century silver caudle cups found in a London flea market and a Philadelphia Chippendale tea table that may break the American-furniture auction record of $687,000 are among the highlights in New York sales tomorrow and next week. Up for bidding in the largest and most important auctions of Americana this season will be hundreds of pieces of 18th- and 19th-century furniture, paintings, folk art, ceramics, silver and textiles. Sotheby's expects its sales will total $4 million to $6 million; Christie's, $2 million to $3 million. Outstanding among the period furnishings and artworks is the exuberantly carved Philadelphia tea table in the auction tomorrow at 10 A.M. and 2:15 P.M. at Christie's, Park Avenue at 59th Street. ''If any piece of furniture has a crack at the record right now, this table is it,'' said Dean Failey, a Christie's specialist, of the mahogany tilt-top table with a scalloped-edge top, fluted columnar base and claw and ball feet.
1986-01-10	AUCTIONS	''THE AGE OF CARAVAGGIO'' exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year spurred dozens of collectors to get in touch with Sotheby's about paintings they owned that they thought were by the late-16th-century Italian artist or one of his followers. ''We must have had 50 or more inquiries from would-be sellers,'' George Wachter, Sotheby's Old Master paintings specialist, said. ''They came from all over - South America, Mexico, Canada, the United States and Europe.'' Although none of the paintings turned out to be by Caravaggio, he said, several proved interesting for other reasons.
1986-01-03	AUCTION	SEIJIRO MATSUOKA, a Japanese real-estate entrepreneur, flew in from Tokyo last month to bid at Sotheby's and Christie's for Chinese porcelains, paintings and ancient bronzes, which he has been collecting for 66 years. Mr. Matsuoka, an exuberant man with a ready smile who will be 92 next Wednesday, came prepared to buy at both galleries and did, spending more than $1 million in four days of ''shopping.'' The works he bought in New York - and those he purchased for $600,000 in London the following week - have been shipped to Tokyo, where they will be exhibited with his other Chinese ceramics, Japanese artworks, Picassos, Renoirs, Egyptian antiquities and Indian sculpture in his private Matsuoka Museum of Art. Mr. Matsuoka's art holdings -thousands of works - have outgrown the museum space at the top of his office building in downtown Tokyo. For this reason, he explained recently, he is building a much larger facility outside Tokyo in Atami, an area of hot springs. It will open in a year or two, he said.
1985-12-20	AUCTIONS	HENRY MILLER'S original typescript of ''Tropic of Cancer,'' one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, will be auctioned in February at Sotheby's. This typed 926-page version, completed in Paris in 1932-33, is considered as important as a hand-written manuscript, because Miller always wrote directly on the typewriter. David Redden, who heads Sotheby's books and manuscripts department, described the typescript as ''the most important contemporary manuscript or typescript we have ever handled.'' The decision to auction it, according to John Chesko, Miller's friend and agent at his death in 1980, ''came from Henry to me.'' Mr. Chesko explained by telephone from Santa Cruz, Calif., that the directive came to him in a note in Miller's hand, signed and dated Jan. 12, 1979. Mr. Chesko read the note: ''This is to testify that the bearer, John Chesko, is not a crook but a friend who is trying to help me sell some of my library to the highest bidder. Be good to him. Henry Miller.''
1985-12-06	PEALE PORTRAIT BRINGS RECORD PRICE AT AUCTION	Rembrandt Peale's sensitive, informal portrait of his younger brother, ''Rubens Peale With a Geranium'' (1801), sold for $4,070,000 to the National Gallery of Art yesterday, the highest price ever paid at auction for an American painting. ''It is the first American portrait in a truly American style,'' J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery, said seconds after the hammer fell, explaining the museum's purchase. The record for Peale at auction until yesterday was $82,500, paid in 1972, for ''Portrait of George Washington,'' one of several painted by the artist. At the two-session auction of American art, Georgia O'Keeffe's ''White Rose, New Mexico,'' was sold to an unidentified buyer for $1,265,000, almost four times the previous high at auction for a painting by the artist. The two-session sale totaled $13,950,750, the highest figure ever achieved for a sale of American art, and appeared to provide further evidence that quality artworks of all periods and styles continue to command extraordinary prices at auction.
1985-12-06	AUCTIONS	FIFTY years of works designed by major innovators - from Louis Comfort Tiffany's stained-glass lamps of 1900 through Piero Fornasetti's fool-the-eye furniture of the 1950's - will be auctioned tomorrow and next weekend at Sotheby's and Christie's. Outstanding among the Art Deco offerings is a piano by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann that was introduced at the 1925 Paris show from which the style derives its name - the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes. The focal point of the exposition's Grand Salon and one of only six pianos designed by this master cabinetmaker of the Art Deco movement, the instrument is the most important work up for bidding tomorrow at 2 P.M. at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. Housed in a squarish case, along with works by Gaveau, the piano is framed in tiger-striped makassar ebony and its cariole legs are embellished with ivory inlay and ivory socks. It is estimated to sell for $250,000 to $350,000. A more curvaceous, sleeker grand piano, from its mica lid and red leather covered sides to its chromed slender legs, is expected to bring up to $25,000. It was designed by Paul Henningsen in 1935 for Andreas Christensen of Denmark.
1985-11-29	AUCTIONS	THE 4-foot-5 1/2-inch-tall copy of the Statue of Liberty that belonged to Frederic Auguste Bartholdi will be auctioned at 2 P.M. tomorrow at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. The figure, one of many made to raise money to build the 305-foot-high colossus, is expected to sell for more than $125,000, which would be an auction record for one of these reductions. According to Barbara Deisroth, Sotheby's decorative arts specialist, this copy, one of the tallest extant and the only bronze version known in that size, descended in the family of Bartholdi's wife, Jeanne Baheux de Puyssieux, to the present owner, who has not been identified. The copy was cast by Thiebaut Freres, a Paris foundry. It is about the same size as the white-metal version cast by Avoiron, another Paris foundry, that was sold for $121,000, an auction record, at Christie's in May to Charles E. F. Millard, chairman of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York. Mr. Millard said one reason for Coca-Cola's interest was its own centennial next year.
1985-11-27	Carolingian Manuscript Is Auctioned in London	A long-lost illuminated Carolingian manuscript of the ninth century, known as the ''Gospels of St. Hubert,'' sold yesterday at Sotheby's in London for $2,099,240 to an unidentified European buyer. The price paid for the vellum work was more than five times what the auction house had expected it would bring.
1985-11-21	Art Auction Collects $663,350 for AIDS	An auction of contemporary art at Sotheby's to benefit the Gay Men's Health Crisis raised $663,350 last night, one of the highest totals ever for a benefit auction.
1985-11-21	REDOUTE WATERCOLORS AUCTIONED TO SYNDICATE	The Empress Josephine's copy of Pierre-Joseph Redoute's botanical watercolors for his book ''Les Liliacees,'' (''The Lilies'') was auctioned yesterday at Sotheby's for $5.5 million to W. Graham Arader, a rare-book and print dealer, who organized a syndicate to make the purchase. The book of 468 watercolors on vellum depicts flowers in the gardens of Malmaison, St.-Cloud, Versailles and Sevres. It was made between 1802 and 1816, and comprises 16 volumes weighing a total of 320 pounds. The sale lasted only three minutes, one of the fastest ever for such an expensive property, and the price achieved was the 10th highest for a work purchased at an art auction house.
1985-11-15	AUCTIONS	EMPRESS JOSEPHINE'S copy of Pierre-Joseph Redoute's botanical watercolors for ''Les Liliacees'' (''The Lilies'') will be auctioned next Wednesday at Sotheby's, and the bidding may last five minutes or five hours. The 468 drawings on vellum of the flowers in the gardens of Malmaison, St.-Cloud, Versailles and Sevres, made between 1802 and 1816, fill 16 volumes, weigh a total of 320 pounds and may sell, the auction house says, for $5 million to $7 million. The watercolors will be offered first as an entity at 10:15 A.M., and if the work fails to find a buyer at the price expected, the drawings will be auctioned one by one. If they are sold individually, the sale will be in two sessions that are expected to last most of the day. Whether they are sold in one bid or singly, Sotheby's expects the total will be the same figure, as much as $7 million.
1985-11-15	Schiele Work Sold	Egon Schiele's ''Portrait of Johann Harms,'' a 1916 watercolor drawing, was sold yesterday at Sotheby's to Serge Sabarsky, a Madison Avenue dealer, for $693,000, the highest price ever paid at auction for an Expressionist drawing. The work, which had been estimated to sell for as much as $200,000, was owned by George Moore, a 31-year-old American artist who lives in Managua, Nicaragua. Mr. Moore, reached after the sale, said he had sold the drawing to start a foundation to help the poor of Central America and that all the proceeds from the sale would be used for this purpose.
1985-11-08	AUCTIONS	IMPRESSIONIST and modern artworks are the dominant offerings at major auctions next week that will also feature photography, prints, illustrated books, French furniture and African and American Indian art. The total value of works in these sales at Christie's and Sotheby's is $64 million, with the Impressionist and modern art accounting for about $55 million. Many of the important paintings and sculpture - by Monet, Matisse, van Gogh, Renoir, Modigliani, de Chirico and Cezanne - are from private collections and have not been on the market in many years. All works in the sales are on view this weekend at the two auction houses.
1985-11-07	52 MODERN ARTWORKS AUCTIONED AT CHRISTIE'S	John Graham's untitled 1942 portrait of a woman sold last night at Christie's for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by the artist - and three times the figure it was auctioned for five years ago. The painting, among 52 out of 73 works that sold, was purchased by an American collector, as were most of the other major works that sold last night. None of the buyers of these works were identified.
1985-11-06	MODERN PAINTINGS SOLD	Arshile Gorky's ''From a High Place,'' an untitled Surrealist oil painting on cardboard, sold last night at Sotheby's for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by the artist. Although records were also established for Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly and Andy Warhol, most of the other major works in the auction of post-World War II art did not find buyers. ''The market continues to be strong for Abstract Expressionist paintings but it is fragile for art of the 1960's and 1970's,'' Lucy Havelock-Allan, Sotheby's specialist in contemporary art, said following the sale, in which 56 of the 83 works offered sold for a total of $6.3 million. ''Dealers had warned me before the sale that there is a resistance of buying at the top end of the market, for paintings over $500,000.''
1985-10-29	IT'S PALM BEACH IN NEW YORK - BRIEFLY	THE Palm Beach All-Stars brought their money and glitter to town the other night, and players from Newport, Saratoga, Southampton and the Upper East Side eagerly turned out to celebrate. The ensuing Palm Beach Ball, an elegant salute to Florida's flamboyant sandbar, was a benefit for the National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction. It was held at Sotheby's, which was hardly reluctant to have so many rich potential buyers mill about among its auction splendors. And it was Mrs. Peter A. B. Widener 3d's first crack at New York fund raising.
1985-10-25	AUCTIONS	A COPY of the cartoon that started Paul Revere's career as a political propagandist will be auctioned Thursday at 10:15 A.M. at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. The engraving, the only colored version of the five known copies, shows a dragon, representing the Stamp Act, attacked by a number of people, symbolizing the Colonies, while a New Hampshire tax collector is hung in effigy from the Liberty Tree. This copy was unknown until earlier this year when the New Hampshire woman who owns it -and who has asked the auction house not to disclose her identity - got in touch with Mary-Jo Kline, Sotheby's specialist in historical American manuscripts. She told Dr. Kline that she is a descendant of the Boston family that had acquired the cartoon, ''A View of the Year 1765,'' when it was issued in 1766.
1985-10-24	SOTHEBY'S PICKS NEW CHAIRMAN	Lord Gowrie, a former London art dealer who resigned as British Minister of the Arts in September, has returned to the commercial art world as chairman of Sotheby's International, the auction house announced yesterday. The announcement came as a surprise. It had earlier been reported in London that Lord Gowrie would join Sotheby's chief rival, Christie's, which had lost David Bathurst in July following his admission that he had falsely reported the number of paintings sold in a New York auction in 1981. Mr. Bathurst, who was chairman of Christie's operations in London and New York at the time of his resignation, has since been replaced in both posts.
1985-10-18	AUCTIONS	MOST of the Peter Tillou collection of American folk paintings - including compelling portraits by Ammi Phillips, Erastus Salisbury Field and Robert Peckham - will be sold at Sotheby's next weekend in an auction that the house describes as the first major assemblage of 18th- and 19th-century American naive paintings to appear at public sale. The 111 oil paintings, watercolors and drawings from the art dealer in Litchfield, Conn., go on view tomorrow and will be sold on Saturday, Oct. 25, starting at 10:15 A.M., at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. Mr. Tillou said this week that he was selling most of his folk art to concentrate more on Dutch old masters. ''I've had 20 years of putting the folk-art collection together and showing it in over 12 museums,'' he said. ''I just thought that, rather than store everything, I would let it go back into the collecting world.'' The decision to sell at auction seemed ''the fairest way - so that everyone would have a chance at buying works they may have admired when they were exhibited,'' he added.
1985-10-11	Engravings by Audubon.	JOHN JAMES AUDUBON was blind and dying in 1850 when the City of New York bought for $1,000 a set of ''The Birds of America,'' the last copy sold of the illustrator's masterpiece before his death the next year. Audubon's son Victor negotiated the sale of the 435 hand-colored engravings to the city, which will auction its copy next weekend at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. Proceeds of the sale, which Sotheby's expects will bring as much as $1.2 million, will be used by the city's Department of Records and Information Services for a variety of programs including public exhibitions of materials in the municipal archives. Tomorrow all the prints from this beautifully illustrated book go on view, hung floor to ceiling and wall to wall in several rooms at the gallery, where they will remain through next Thursday. They will be sold one by one next Friday at 2 P.M. and Saturday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M..
1985-10-04	AUCTIONS	AUCTIONGOERS have a rare opportunity this weekend to view two dramatically different antiques collections assembled by wealthy families over more than a half century. Curiosities dominate in one, while the other is filled with handsome though more predictable furnishings. Both contain offerings that are expected to sell for moderate prices when they are auctioned next week at New York's two largest auction houses. At Christie's, visitors will see the provocative contents of a 20-room triplex overlooking the East River, which was the home in the River House of Boventura and Christopher J. Devine, a securities dealer. Mr. Devine died in 1963, and Mrs. Devine was in her early 80's when she died in March.
1985-09-27	AUCTIONS	WHAT are the wire whisks, copper mixing bowls and funnels from James Beard's kitchen worth? Or the marble-topped, iron-based dining table around which Danny Kaye, Julia Child, Burgess Meredith and Andre Surmain gathered? Bidders will find out when property from the estate of Mr. Beard, the chef and cookbook author who died at the age of 81 in January, is auctioned next Thursday at William Doyle Galleries, 175 East 87th Street. The two-session sale of the contents of Mr. Beard's Greenwich Village home begins at 10 A.M. with the dispersal of furniture, decorations and cooking equipment, and continues at 7 P.M. with the sale of his jewelry and books. The auction of more than 650 lots is expected to total $180,000 or more. James Andrew Beard was an avid collector of 19th- and 20th-century English, Portuguese and American majolica. A large, unusual assortment of these colorful polychrome earthenware platters, jugs, trays, sets of dishes, bowls, tureens and a compote stand - some embellished with three-dimensional snakes, frogs, fish and seaweed - filled shelves and tabletops in the two-story glass-enclosed dining room of Mr. Beard's duplex.
1985-09-13	AUCTIONS	THE Festival of India has arrived, and timed to coincide with the celebration, Sotheby's is staging what it describes as the largest auction of medieval Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture ever held in New York. On view tomorrow through next week will be more than 700 works -stone and bronze sculpture, paintings on wood and glass, gold and enamel jewelry, steel armor and furniture -that will be sold next Friday and Saturday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. at Sotheby's galleries, York Avenue at 72d Street. In the Asian art field, where auctions are usually modest in size and scope, this sale is viewed as extremely ambitious. Sotheby's specialists expect the works to bring prices ranging from about $1,000 for an eight-inch-tall fourth-century stone head of Buddha, to about $150,000 for an 11th-century Chola dynasty bronze depicting Siva as a god of music on a lotus throne.
1985-09-06	AUCTIONS	WHEN Christie's auctioned the contents of the Duke of Buckingham's home at Stowe in 1848, the sale lasted 40 days and caused a flurry of activity described by The Times of London as ''a cavalcade which was daily making its way to the magnificent Palladian facade.'' Although far shorter in duration, house sales are still being held by international auction concerns today and they still draw crowds. Indeed, the chance to take even a brief look at an extraordinary home and inspect the bounty of a lifetime worth of collecting makes it a social event every bit as much as a serious auction. As recently as July, Christie's sold the contents of Gray Craig, the 1920's Newport, R.I., cottage of Archbold van Beuren, the founder and chairman of Cue magazine, who died in 1974. The two-day auction attracted more than 1,000 visitors. And, as at all house sales, the quality and range of objects was vast - all the contents of the house were for sale, from an early Maxfield Parrish painting to Louis Vuitton steamer trunks and bed linens. The bidding, which took place under a large pink and white tent, became something of a media event, and video screens placed along the sides of the tent were used to highlight many of the small objects.
1985-08-30	Auction Houses List Season's Benefit Sales	The following are the major benefit auctions scheduled at Sotheby's and Christie's in the coming season. Information numbers are provided in most cases.
1985-08-17	THE PURE MARKET AT SOTHEBY'S	To the Editor: Throughout the almost two and a half centuries that Sotheby's has been auctioneers of fine art and antiques, we have had a reputation for service, for honesty and for integrity. We value this reputation, as we do the traditions and the practices that have been our trademark since 1744. We are deeply troubled, therefore, by the analogies, allegations and implications in your Aug. 5 editorial.
1985-08-16	AUCTIONS	JUST what is involved in a wine auction, it seems, depends upon which side of the Atlantic you are on. In the United States, for example, it is a social occasion - an all-weekend gala filled with picnics and parties and black-tie dinners. Bargains are virtually unheard of, as the bidders are invited guests well aware that the money raised is likely to go to charity. In Europe, in contrast, it is strictly business - a single weekday event with barely a break for lunch. The bidders are mostly retailers and restaurateurs, with a sprinkling of avid collectors, all looking for the best deal.
1985-08-15	SOTHEBY'S SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED BY JUDGE	A judge in Manhattan yesterday approved a settlement between the State Attorney General and Sotheby's involving a disputed 1984 auction of rare Hebrew books and manuscripts. Under the agreement, the most valuable works will be recalled from the buyers and redistributed to institutions where they will be made available to the public. After the terms of the out-of-court settlement were announced last month, the judge, Robert E. White of State Supreme Court, asked for comment by members of the public before he decided whether to make the agreement final. In a brief courtroom hearing yesterday, Judge White said that he had received many written protests against the settlement, but that he believed ''the bottom line remains the same - the court finds that such settlement is in the public interest.''
1985-08-07	OHIO COLLEGE DISMISSES SELLER OF HEBREW BOOKS	The professor involved in the contested auction of 56 Hebrew books and manuscripts at Sotheby's last year has been dismissed by a rabbinical seminary in Cincinnati where he taught since 1940, it was disclosed yesterday. The professor, Alexander Guttmann, was criticized last week by Hebrew Union College, a rabbinical seminary, for consigning manuscripts and books for sale that the college said he did not own. In a related development yesterday, a New York State Supreme Court judge postponed a final decision on a settlement reached last month involving the manuscripts and books, which Sotheby's sold at auction last summer. The settlement was arranged after the State Attorney General Robert Abrams sued Sotheby's for ''persistent fraud and illegality.'' Mr. Abrams charged that Dr. Guttmann did not own the books and therefore had no right to sell them.
1985-08-05	The Hammer and the Fickle	What purer market is there than an auction? Informed buyers compete openly and the highest bidder wins. So much for that illusion, at least as it applies to auctions for art, heirlooms and other elegances. It now turns out that some auction houses do their business rather like houses of another kind, with large mirrors and loose morals.
1985-08-02	AUCTIONS	AUCTION practices and the consignor's special role became one of the most discussed subjects in the art field last month after there was a disclosure in court papers that David Bathurst, chairman of Christie's London and New York, had falsely reported the sale of three Impressionist paintings in New York in 1981, when in fact only one had been purchased. Mr. Bathurst, who was president of Christie's in New York when the auction took place, resigned as chairman of the auction house two weeks ago. The consignor's role in a sale is even more difficult for auctiongoers to understand than the buyer's role, because the seller is usually the silent party in the auction process. The contracts that sellers sign with an auction establishment vary from house to house, as do some of the practices. Today's column examines some of the most frequently asked questions regarding the consignor's role in auctions. The answers are based on interviews with officials at New York's four largest art auction houses -Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips Son & Neale and William Doyle Galleries. Q. What proof of ownership or right to sell is required of consignors at auction houses?
1985-08-02	SOTHEBY'S SETTLEMENT ON JUDAICA CHALLENGED	Officials of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati yesterday asked a New York State judge in Manhattan to set aside a tentative settlement and order a trial to determine who owns a collection of Hebrew books and manuscripts sold by Sotheby's in New York last summer. The request was in the form of a memorandum filed with the judge, Robert E. White of State Supreme Court, who on July 16 asked for public comments on the tentative settlement. Under the agreement, reached earlier this month, Sotheby's would waive all profits from the sale but would recall from buyers manuscripts sold in the auction last year.
1985-07-27	AUCTION-HOUSE SALES INCREASE WORLDWIDE	Auction sales increased worldwide last season, according to preliminary figures released this week by the three largest international art-auction houses - Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips Son & Neale. At the three London-based houses the estimated sales totals for the season ending Aug. 31 are the highest ever for an auction season.
1985-07-17	SOTHEBY'S TO RECALL HEBREW BOOKS IT SOLD	Sotheby's agreed yesterday to recall from buyers a collection of rare Hebrew books and manuscripts sold at auction last summer and to redistribute them to institutions where they would be available for viewing by the public. The agreement was part of an out-of-court settlement with the New York State Attorney General under which the auction house would waive all profits from the sale. It was approved by Judge Robert E. White of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who has asked for public comments until July 31. He will consider the comments and decide by Aug. 6 whether to make the settlement final.
1985-07-05	AUCTIONS	Most of the wares auctioned here twice a year by Christie's and Sotheby's in sales totaling millions of dollars move in and out of Switzerland as swiftly and easily as many tourists do. The jewelry, Faberge baubles, Galle vases, Cartier clocks, French gold boxes and Art Deco books that are sold here in May and November are imported, auctioned and exported within weeks, thanks to Swiss laws that favor free movement of these goods. Jewelry, considered the most important of the wares sold in Switzerland, is also the most portable. All the gems from one sale could enter and leave the country in an attache case - and frequently do. Hans Nadelhoffer, Christie's president in Switzerland, explained that the accent on smallness that extends to most of the goods auctioned here is suggested by the city itself. ''It's a Lilliput city,'' he said, ''and a great deal more.''
1985-06-28	BRITISH PENSION FUND BUYS MANUSCRIPT PIECE	The pension fund of Britain's state-owned railroad said today that it paid $105,600 for a fragment of a 1,300-year-old manuscript sold by the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington. The British Rail Pension Fund disclosed it was the buyer of the vellum fragment auctioned at Sotheby's on Tuesday.
1985-06-21	AUCTIONS	THE Beatles' yellow Rolls-Royce, a 19-foot-long limousine decorated with psychedelic motifs and flowers framed in red scrollwork, is the star attraction in an auction of rock-and-roll collectibles June 29 at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. The Phantom V automobile, purchased by John Lennon in 1966 and decorated a year later by him and a mystic friend, goes on view tomorrow at the gallery. The Beatles used the automobile from 1966 to 1969. Later it was lent to the Rolling Stones, the Moody Blues and Bob Dylan, among others. Mr. Lennon brought it to the United States in 1970. Seven years later, he and Yoko Ono donated it to the Cooper Hewitt Museum - the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Design - as a fund-raising aid. The museum exhibited the Rolls in 1978 and 1979, and is the consignor of the car, which Sotheby's expects will sell for $200,000 to $300,000.
1985-06-14	AUCTIONS	EIGHT 500-year-old polychrome picture bowls, excavated near Snowflake, Ariz., after 1900, are among a group of American Indian art works to be auctioned at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street, next Friday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. and Saturday at 10:15 A.M. The other major offerings include an Eskimo cave mask, a Navajo chief's blanket and a ceremonial tunic worn until a year ago by an important member of the Tlingit tribe of Alaska. The prehistoric Southwest pottery bowls, dating from about 1350 to 1400, are among the 50 known surviving examples of such clay wares. ''Most are in museums,'' Ellen Napiura said. She added that the vessels, which are brick-red patterned with black-and-white abstract figural images, had belonged to a prominent Phoenix trader, Margaret Cross, until she sold her collection a few years ago to Gary Linscott, who owns a radio station in Casa Grande, Ariz.
1985-06-12	FORBES 11, KREMLIN 10 IN FABERGE EGG RACE	Malcolm Forbes, the magazine publisher, yesterday paid $1.76 million for a bejeweled Easter egg, created in 1900 by Faberge for Czar Nicholas II. While the price set an auction record, it also established a record of even greater interest to Mr. Forbes. Until yesterday, the only other major collector of Faberge eggs in the world was the Soviet Government, which displays 10 of the eggs at the Armory Museum in Moscow. Mr. Forbes has also exhibited 10 of the eggs at his own museum of art and collectibles, annexed to the offices of Forbes Magazine at 60 Fifth Avenue. Starting this morning, the number shown by Mr. Forbes will increase by one.
1985-05-17	AUCTIONS	MOST of what is left of Jack and Belle Linsky's vast holdings in porcelains, paintings, bronzes, jewelry and furniture - perhaps $2 million worth - will be auctioned at Sotheby's next week. The Linskys, who both came to this country from Russia as children, made their fortune in a stationery business that included Swingline, the manufacturer of staplers. They collected for more than four decades, until Mr. Linsky died in 1980. Then Mrs. Linsky decided to donate most of the collection - about $60 million worth - to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it went on view in its own galleries a year ago. Of the 176 offerings up for bidding Tuesday at 2 P.M. at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street, half are objects returned by the Metropolitan. These include duplicates of porcelains, among which is a pair of Meissen figures modeled by Johann Joachim Kaendler about 1737. They depict ''The Thrown Kiss'' and are expected to sell for a total of up to $25,000.
1985-05-15	SCHIELE OIL PAINTING SOLD AT AUCTION OF MODERN ART	Egon Schiele's 1917 oil painting ''Summer Landscape'' brought the highest price of Sotheby's auction of 119 Modern and Impressionist art works last night. It was one of the few major successes of a sale in which 53 of the 119 offerings did not find buyers. ''There were too many things in the sale,'' Klaus Perls, a Madison Avenue dealer, said after the sale had ended. ''And so many of the pictures were of rather indifferent quality. To me the main thing that weas the problem was the asking prices - the prices at which the owners agreed to sell were too high.''
1985-05-10	AUCTIONS	IMPRESSIONIST and modern works valued at more than $65 million - including 17 Monets and 10 Magrittes as well as works by van Gogh, Gauguin, Cezanne, Picasso, Braque, Schiele, Renoir and Dali - are on view this weekend before their sale next week at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, Son & Neale. Sotheby's first session, on Tuesday at 7 P.M., will offer 120 works - and may be eventful. Outstanding among the $43 million worth of art up for bidding is Egon Schiele's ''Summer Landscape,'' a 1917 oil depicting a town of winding roads, houses with steeply pitched roofs and dark clusters of trees. Describing the work, David J. Nash, Sotheby's director of fine art, said, ''It is a sinister little village -pure Kafka.'' Although Schiele did many town paintings throughout his life, none have come up for auction in this country, and only three from 1917 are outside of Austria, according to Serge Sabarsky, the New York dealer who has organized Schiele exhibitions from Tokyo to Tel Aviv. He is working with Rudolf Leopold, a Vienna collector, on a catalogue raisonne of the Austrian Expressionist artist's work.
1985-05-10	BEETHOVEN LETTER AUCTIONED	A letter from Ludwig van Beethoven to the woman identified by recent research as his mysterious ''Immortal Beloved,'' was sold for the equivalent of $67,100 yesterday, Sotheby's auction house said. The price paid by an anonymous European buyer at a sale of music and manuscripts was more than double the previous maximum for a letter by the German composer.
1985-05-03	BARNETT NEWMAN'S 'ULYSSES' SOLD AT SOTHEBY'S AUCTION	Barnett Newman's ''Ulysses,'' an epic 1952 blue-and-black striped painting, sold last night for a record price at Sotheby's to an American collector who was not identified. The sale of 82 artworks broke auction records for the works of 16 artists and nearly doubled the highest total for such a sale of postwar art. The standing-room-only audience at the auction house, York Avenue at 72d Street, applauded enthusiastically as John Marion brought down his hammer on the Newman, an outsized work 11 feet tall, which is the only one of this series in private hands. It sold for $1,595,000, five times the price ever paid at auction for a Newman.
1985-05-01	Bids	No collection of Watergate memorabilia would be really complete without a painting of former President Richard M. Nixon and six of his Administration leaders and White House aides that will be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York today. The artist is K. T. Smith, who was able to persuade E. Howard Hunt and four of the convicted Watergate burglars to sign his work because they were all inmates along with the artist at the same time in the Federal Correctional Facility at Danbury, Conn. The auction house estimates the value of the painting, which is dated May 1973, at $8,000 to $10,000.
1985-04-26	GOULD ART COLLECTION BRINGS RECORD PRICES	The record-breaking two-day auction of Florence J. Gould's 200 Impressionist and modern artworks ended yesterday at Sotheby's. Wednesday's sale had set record auction prices for an Impressionist painting and for a single-session sale of art from a collection. The total was $34 million for the two-day sale. About 50 people remained in the room at 12:15 P.M., when John L. Marion brought down his gavel on the last lot in yesterday morning's session, at which Mrs. Gould's more moderate-priced Old-Master and 19th- and 20th-century paintings and drawings sold for $1.4 million. The sale was held at the auction house galleries, York Avenue at 72d Street. Sotheby's sold Mrs. Gould's furniture, books and decorations in Monte Carlo last June for $6.5 million and Christie's auctioned her jewelry in New York a year ago for $8 million.
1985-04-26	AUCTIONS	MAJOR Abstract Expressionist paintings by Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Morris Louis will be auctioned next week at Sotheby's and Christie's. At Sotheby's, Lucy Havelock-Allan, director of the contemporary art department, said: ''Our sale will be a significant test of the strength of the Abstract Expressionist market.'' The auction offers nine Abstract Expressionist works and one Pop Art painting, each expected to sell for $400,000 to $1 million. These works will be in the first session of the two-day sale set for Thursday at 7 P.M. and Friday at 10:15 A.M. at the Sotheby's galleries, York Avenue at 72d Street.
1985-04-25	ART SALE SETS RECORD FOR A VAN GOGH	The sale last night of Impressionist and modern art from the collection of Florence J. Gould brought the highest total ever bid for a collection in a single session, and also established a new high for an Impressionist painting - Van Gogh's ''Landscape With Rising Sun.'' The much-publicized sale of 56 paintings from the collection of Mrs. Gould, daughter-in-law of the 19th-century railroad magnate Jay Gould, attracted some of the world's most prominent art collectors. Stavros Niarchos, C. Douglas Dillon, Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, Ann Getty, Ian Woodner, Susan Gutfreund and Ronald and Leonard Lauder were among more the 1,000 attending the sale at the Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. However, when John L. Marion's gavel came down on the last lot in a sale that totaled $32.6 million, most of the art collectors in the room went away empty-handed. There were at least two exceptions - Baron Thyssen, who bought a Seurat for $275,000 and a Fantin-Latour still life for $74,250, and Mr. Woodner, who acquired a Corot for $66,000. Sotheby's did not announce any names of the buyers of the major works.
1985-04-20	CHAMPAGNE AND GREAT ART MIX WILL AT SOTHEBY'S	Glenn Close was there. So was Princess Chantal of France. Prince Edouard de Lobkowicz was there. Cristiane Guerlain flew in from Paris. It was an evening of jewels, Champagne and kisses on both cheeks at Sotheby's Thursday night. But the real stars of the evening were the paintings.
1985-04-19	AUCTIONS	WHAT may be the biggest auction of the year, the sale of the Florence J. Gould collection of 200 Impressionist, post-Impressionist and Old Master paintings, will take place Wednesday and Thursday after exhibition this weekend at Sotheby's. The highly publicized sale - with works by van Gogh, Gauguin, Cezanne, Degas and Toulouse- Lau trec - is expected to break many records and to bring in more than $25 million. The Gould sale at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street, has attracted a number of other impressive offerings at the city's auction houses. The result is the mostly varied assortment of art, antiques, jewelry and books to be offered for viewing and auction in years, all of it on view this weekend.
1985-04-12	AUCTIONS	THE private print collection of Tatyana Grosman, who has been credited with turning print publishing from a business into an art, will be on view this weekend and auctioned next Thursday at Christie's, Park Avenue at 59th Street. Mrs. Grosman, who founded Universal Limited Art Editions in 1957, was the first publisher in the post-World War II period in America to produce original prints by major artists. At the time of her death in 1982, her contribution in publishing the works of Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, Helen Frankenthaler and Robert Motherwell was being marked by exhibitions at two museums - the Museum of Modern Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. ''We didn't know most of these existed,'' Bill Goldston, her master printer and successor, who is an executor of the estate, said of the 260 prints and drawings found after her death. Mr. Goldston said that Mrs. Grosman had saved examples of about one-third of Universal's prints and stored them neatly in drawers at her home in West Islip, L.I., a former gardener's cottage that was enlarged to include Universal's main studio.
1985-04-05	AUTIONS	Seijiro Matsuoka, a 91-year-old Japanese real estate entrepreneur and museum owner, often flies to New York and London to bid at Sotheby's and Christie's for the Ming vases, Picassos and Renoirs he collects. But Mr. Matsuoka did not attend the public auction of the Japanese Antique Dealers Association held here last week. Instead, he bid through an art dealer and purchased a pair of contemporary Japanese scrolls that he plans to hang in his Matsuoka Museum of Art. Mr. Matsuoka is typical of collectors here. They rarely attend public auctions, which are held infrequently and differ dramatically from those in the West. Four public auctions are organized each year in Tokyo by two groups: the Tokyo Antique Dealers Association and the Tokyo Art Dealers Association.
1985-04-02	Sotheby's to Auction Beatles' Rolls Royce	The Beatles' Rolls Royce, a 19-foot- long limousine decorated with colorful scrollwork and psychedelic designs, will be sold June 29 at a Sotheby's auction of rock-and-roll memorabilia. The Phantom V limousine, gold and yellow with a white hood and swirls of colors on the hubcaps, was designed by a gypsy mystic working in collaboration with John Lennon, according to Sotheby's.
1985-03-29	AUCTION OF DOCUMENTS ON BETSY ROSS CANCELED	An auction of documents relating to the life of Betsy Ross, from the Elsie O. Sang collection, was called off by Sotheby's and Mrs. Sang earlier this week after the City of Philadelphia said one of the documents had been stolen from its files. The document in the dispute is a 1776 administrative bond for the estate of Betsy Ross's first husband that is signed ''Elizabeth Ross.''
1985-03-28	LINCOLN PHOTO IS AUCTIONED	The highest price ever paid for a photograph sold at auction was given yesterday by Malcolm Forbes Jr., who purchased a photograph of Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad at an auction at Sotheby's, a spokesman for the company said yesterday. The photograph, signed by Mr. Lincoln, sold for $104,500.
1985-03-08	Rare posters to be offered.	More than a score of rare posters by Alphonse Mucha, A. M. Cassandre, Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec and Walter Schnackenberg are among the 330 items to be offered tomorrow in the first sale organized by Poster Auctions International, a new specialty auction house. The sale begins at 1 P.M. at the Essex House, 160 Central Park South. Outstanding in this auction are a number of Art Nouveau and Art Deco posters that are available here for the first time, according to Jack Rennert, who heads Poster Auctions, a New York concern. Mr. Rennert is no stranger to the poster field. He began producing commercial posters 20 years ago, and switched to period designs in 1979, operating as a dealer with a mail-order business, and organizing eight sales for Phillips Son & Neale over a five-year period.
1985-02-01	AUCTIONS	A RARE, small Roman bronze figure of Hermes, an outsized Hellenistic marble torso of an athlete and a turquoise faience Egyptian hippopotamus are three reasons why Sotheby's has high expectations for its antiquities auction next Friday and Saturday. According to Richard Keresey, director of Sotheby's antiquities department, ''it is arguably the best offering of its kind'' in New York since the 1971 Parke Bernet sale of ancient art from the Cranbrook Academy of Art Museum in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The Roman Hermes, a second-century work, is less than 6 inches tall. The pose is classic: Hermes stands at ease, his weight on the right leg, his neatly coiffed head turned right, a mantle draped over his left shoulder. This indicates the figure was inspired by Polyclitus, the Greek sculptor of the fifth century B.C., Mr. Keresey said. Exotic touches appear in the use of silver inlay for the teeth and the whites of the eyes.
1984-12-05	SASSOON JUDAICA SOLD AT SOTHEBY'S	The fourth sale of manuscripts from the collection of David Solomon Sassoon, a Bombay-born British collector, last night established a record for a Judaica auction and for a Hebrew Bible purchased at public sale, Sotheby's said. Despite a noticeable lack of interest in many works, bidding on some of the more sought-after manuscripts kept many in the audience on their feet through much of the sale at the New York auction house. The auction total of $3,121,535 was $1 million higher than the first sale of Sassoon Judaica, which Sotheby's said had been the previous record for such an auction. That earlier auction was in Zurich in 1975.
1984-11-23	Stradivarius Is Sold In London for $491,040	A Stradivarius violin and an 18th-century silver dinner service were auctioned for record prices in separate sales here today, a spokesman for Sotheby's auction house said. The violin, made by Antonio Stradivari in 1707, was sold to a London music dealer, Peter Biddulph, for a total price of $491,040.
1984-11-16	The Cave collection.	Pauline K . Cave inherited her passion for French 18th- century furniture from her mother, Olive Lady Baillie, and the wherewithal to buy such treasures from her maternal American ancestors, who were Whitneys (financiers) and Paynes (Standard Oil). Today, Mrs. Cave's $1.5 million collection - 300 French porcelains, furnishings, rugs and Impressionist paintings - will be sold in two sessions at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. Mrs. Cave spent much of her youth in Leeds Castle, an ancient fortress near Maidstone, Kent, which her mother bought in 1926 and spent $2 million to restore and furnish with French and English furniture. Mrs. Cave's father was Thomas Winn, a World War I aviator and the first husband of Lady Baillie; Lady Baillie was the daughter of Lord Queensboro and Pauline Whitney, and the grandaughter of William C. Whitney, a Secretary of the Navy. Lady Baillie acquired her title with her third husband, Sir Adrian Baillie.
1984-11-15	MODIGLIANI WORK SOLD FOR RECORD	Amedeo Modigliani's ''Dreamer,'' a 1917-18 version of the only horizontal image ever painted by the Italian artist, aroused worldwide interest and intense bidding by several American collectors when it was auctioned last night at Sotheby's. ''The Dreamer,'' a painting of a wistful woman shown against a dark background, is one of about 22 reclining versions of this subject, fewer than six of which are in private hands. It was sold last night for $4.62 million to an American buyer who was not identified. The standing room only sale attracted a gathering of more than 1,000 bidders and watchers. It was the highest price paid for any art work in the auction in which 60 out of the 83 art works offered were sold, totaling $30.6 million.
1984-11-10	SOTHEBY'S PLANS 3 AUCTIONS OF JUDAICA	Sotheby's, in what it said was the largest sale of its kind, will auction $5 million in rare Hebrew books, manuscripts and artworks in three successive sales in early December, the company announced yesterday. The most important of the three auctions, according to Sotheby's, will be on Dec. 4 when 97 rare Hebrew manuscripts, worth an estimated $3 million, will be sold from the collection of David Solomon Sassoon, a prominent British collector of Hebrew works. Officials at the auction house yesterday emphasized that the ownership of the property being offered for sale had been thoroughly researched, and that there was no question of ownership for any of the items. A Charge of Fraud In August, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams accused Sotheby's with ''persistent fraud and illegality'' in the June sale of 59 Hebrew books and manuscripts that had been smuggled from a Berlin rabbinical seminary by a professor there in 1940.
1984-11-02	AUCTIONS	FOR months, the photography world has been pondering the effects on collectors, dealers and institutions of several major developments. Among these are the J. Paul Getty Museum's entry into the field, the deaths of Ansel Adams and Brassai, the publication of Patricia Bosworth's biography of Diane Arbus and the exhibition of Irving Penn's works at the Museum of Modern Art. The impact of these developments may take months, even years, to assess. But next week's auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's East of works by scores of 19th- and 20th-century photographers are bound to provide some insight into market trends. Presale exhibitions will be on view over the weekend at both houses.
1984-11-01	FORBES PURCHASES COPY OF LINCOLN PROCLAMATION	Malcolm S. Forbes, the business- magazine publisher, yesterday outbid H. Ross Perot, a Texan, for a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation - a copy that originally sold for $10 more than a century ago. The two men were so intent on getting this 1863 example of the autographed document bearing Abraham Lincoln's signature - one of 48 printed, 20 of which are known to survive - that they kept bidding against each other at Sotheby's, well past the auction house's most optimistic expectations. Mr. Forbes bought the document for $297,000. Three hours later at Sotheby's, one of the largest audiences ever gathered for a sale of post-World War II art witnessed equally enthusiastic bidding on major early paintings by David Hockney - rarities at auction - as well as for works by George Segal, Claes Oldenburg, Francis Bacon and several younger artists. Four Hockneys sold for more than $150,000 each; the highest price paid previously at auction for a work by the artist was $82,570.
1984-10-26	AUCTIONS	THE art auction season moves into high gear this weekend, with presale exhibitions at Sotheby's and Christie's of artworks produced since World War II by such artists as Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Hockney, Claes Oldenburg and Cy Twombly. The sales of the Abstract Expressionist, Pop, Op, Minimalist and Super Realist artworks, taking place next Wednesday through Friday, are separated by two weeks from the even larger Impressionist and modern-art auctions to be held in mid- November. The intermission is because of the Presidential election on Nov. 6, as well as for other, less obvious reasons. ''Four nights in one week was too much for the collectors and dealers to take,'' Lucy Havelock-Allan, Sotheby's specialist in post-World War II art, said. For years, she recalled, the sales of Renoirs through Rauschenbergs were held in one week. Collectors and dealers came from all over the world to New York, spent four nights in the auction rooms and left reeling, their bank accounts, at times, dramatically depleted.
1984-10-19	AUCTIONS	MICHAEL L. AINSLIE, the new president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., has been busy investigating ways to increase services to clients of the American-owned, international art auction house since he assumed command in July of the parent company. The Tennessee-born, 41-year-old executive, who is the former president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, disclosed plans for expansion in several directions in an interview the other day. He said the auction house will introduce in New York the popular art courses given since 1969 by Sotheby's in London. And, he said, the enlargement of its New York galleries, York Avenue at 72d Street, is now necessary.
1984-09-20	TWO AUCTION HOUSES NAME NEW PRESIDENTS	The New York branches of two London auction houses - Sotheby's and Phillips Son & Neale - have named new presidents. John L. Marion, chairman and president of Sotheby Parke Bernet in North America, yesterday named James J. Lally, an executive vice president and chief operating officer, to succeed him as president, effective immediately.
1984-09-19	TWO SWELL GALAS BETTER THAN ONE	IT was one of those Monday nights when the movers and shakers took their jewels out of the vault, donned their most impressive party clothes and told their bodyguards to wear black tie, too. That's the sign of a truly awesome party. And not just one awesome party, but two. Uptown, Sotheby's celebrated its 100th birthday with a benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And at the Waldorf-Astoria, the New York City Partnership Inc. held a dinner-dance to benefit its programs to provide jobs for disadvantaged youths.
1984-09-03	SCHOLAR CALLED A HERO IN JUDAICA CONTROVERSEY	The daughter of a Jewish scholar at the center of a controversy over the sale of rare Hebrew manuscripts said her father should be considered a hero, not a thief, for smuggling the books out of Nazi Germany. ''It's a miracle he got out, let alone the books,'' said Esther Whitman, the daughter of Dr. Alexander Guttmann, a professor emeritus at Hebrew Union College here. ''All he did was save these manuscripts from certain destruction. He is a dedicated loving educator who has only the best interests of his students and fellow man at heart.''
1984-08-31	; New facet in gem auctions.	This is the time of year when devotees of jewelry auctions, a kind of sale whose nature has changed over the years, feel the same rising blood pressure as baseball addicts gripped by pennant fever. Jewelry sales, which were once dominated by dealers and the syndicates they often formed, are now much more open to individuals - both buyers and sellers - who are not in the business, the private clients referred to as ''privates.'' September is the season when Sotheby's and Christie's prepare to go head to head with multimillion-dollar sales, and Phillips, Son & Neale, the third largest auction house, hopes for a seven-digit total. In a few weeks, fans of the gem shows - blase insiders call them the ''All That Glitters'' shows'' - will put aside their vacation sunglasses to squint through reading and magnifying lenses as they study the fat catalogues of Sotheby's and Christie's soon to emerge from the printers.
1984-08-30	HOW SOTHEBY'S RESEARCHED RARE HEBREW BOOKS	In June 1983, George Snyder, an expert in Jewish books and manuscripts at Sotheby's in New York, received a packet of four Polaroid photographs from a visitor to the auction house. The pictures showed an illuminated Hebrew manuscript of a Bible, dating from the 15th century, that Mr. Snyder immediately recognized as being an extremely valuable work. Upon further research, Mr. Snyder learned that there were 58 more volumes where those photographs had come from, and that they belonged to Dr. Alexander Guttmann, an 82-year- old emeritus professor at a rabbinical seminary in Cincinnati. Dr. Guttman was a professer at a Berlin rabbinical seminary, the Hochschule, which owned the books before it was closed by the Nazis in 1942. Although Mr. Snyder did not know it at the time, Dr. Guttmann's books and manuscripts would soon become the centerpiece of a widely publicized lawsuit brought against Sotheby's by New York State Attorney General. The case would also spark a vigorous debate among those interested in the sale - Judaica experts, book dealers, auctioneers, and many others outside the business - over the legal, moral and practical issues that were raised.
1984-08-28	SOTHEBY'S TOLD TO HOLD HEBREW BOOK PROCEEDS	A New York State Supreme Court justice ordered Sotheby's auction house yesterday to withhold the proceeds of a June 26 auction of rare Hebrew books and manuscripts until a full trial on the case could begin in approximately four months. The justice, Robert E. White, said in his decision that the State Attorney General's lawsuit against Sotheby's merited a trial. He also directed the Attorney General, Robert Abrams, to obtain from Sotheby's the names of the buyers of the books and manuscripts and to inform them that they are defendants in the case.
1984-08-16	OHIO PROFESSOR SAYS HE WAS SMUGGLER OF HEBREW BOOKS	An 82-year-old emeritus professor at a rabbinical seminary in Cincinnati said yesterday that he foiled the Gestapo in Nazi Germany 44 years ago and smuggled to the United States 59 rare Hebrew books and manuscripts, which were sold June 26 at a Sotheby's auction. The man, Dr. Alexander Guttmann, made the statement in documents that were submitted in a civil hearing yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. At the hearing, Justice Robert E. White ordered Sotheby's not to distribute the profits of the sale until he decided whether to grant a request by the New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, for an order to have the sale nullified. Such a ruling would stay in effect until the court decided later whether Dr. Guttmann legally owned the books and thus had the right to sell them. Justice White did not say when he would render a decision.
1984-08-15	SOTHEBY'S CRITICAL OF ABRAMS SUIT	In a statement released yesterday, Sotheby's criticized the New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, for releasing, prior to a court hearing, legal papers served on the auction house a week ago. The statement also says that the Attorney General's position is ''based on a callous disregard for both the law and the facts.'' In the papers served on Sotheby's, Mr. Abrams accused Sotheby's of ''persistent fraud and illegality'' in a June 26 auction of rare Hebrew books and manuscripts. A civil hearing in the matter will be held today in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
1984-07-08	BOLIVIANS SEEK TO BLOCK SALE OF GUEVARA'S DIARIES	The Bolivian Government has appealed to British courts to block the scheduled July 16 auction of the diaries of the guerrilla leader Ernesto (Che) Guevara, which it says were stolen from Bolivian military archives. ''We want to provide more proof that the documents were robbed and exported illegally,'' Bolivia's Foreign Minister, Jorge Crespo, said in an interview Friday. ''They are historical documents and belong to our national patrimony. It is part of international snobbery to want them as a relic. But they were stolen and we want them back.''
1984-06-29	HEBREW BOOKS' STORAGE DISCLOSED BY SOTHEBY'S	An unidentified individual smuggled 59 rare Hebrew books and manuscripts from Germany into the United States in 1939 and they remained in a safe-deposit box until most of them were sold at an auction at Sotheby's last Tuesday night, according to statements made by a Sotheby's lawyer. In an affidavit submitted to a State Supreme Court judge on the day of the auction, the Sotheby's lawyer, Marjorie Stone, said the individual smuggled the books ''after receiving them from the chairman of the board'' of a Berlin seminary, called the College for the Scientific Study of Jewish Culture. The seminary was closed by the Nazis in 1942.
1984-06-27	HEBREW BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS SOLD	Thirty-one Hebrew books and manuscripts that were thought to have been destroyed by the Nazis in World War II were sold last night in an auction at Sotheby's, despite a last-minute attempt by the New York State Attorney General to order Sotheby's not to consummate the sales of those items. Also late yesterday afternoon, New York City's Consumer Affairs Department, which had earlier sought to block the auction, issued a permit to Sotheby's auctioneer. Commissioner Angelo J. Aponte of the Consumer Department said yesterday that Sotheby's had proved to his satisfaction that the items for sale were legally owned. But he said the department had received the information in confidence, and he would not say what he knew of the material's history.
1984-06-26	MRS. GOULD'S ANTIQUES AUCTIONED IN MONTE CARLO	French 18th-century antiques belonging to Florence J. Gould that had filled El Patio - her magnificent villa near Cannes - were auctioned tonight in a festive atmosphere that the international socialite and philanthropist might have orchestrated herself. ''She really hoped it would be a gala,'' said John R. Young, an executor and the president of the Florence J. Gould Foundation. ''This is exactly what she wanted and she told me so.'' The foundation that Mrs. Gould established - after her husband's death in 1956 - to promote French-American friendship will benefit from the sale that is being conducted here this week. The sale opened on Sunday and continues through Thursday.
1984-06-26	JUDAICA BOOKS RECORDS SUBPOENAED	The New York State Attorney General and the Consumer Affairs Department of New York City both ordered Sotheby's auction house yesterday to release its records concerning the ownership of 31 Hebrew books and manuscripts that are scheduled for auction tonight. Both of the subpoenas served yesterday asked for all of Sotheby's records concerning the chain of ownership of the books and manuscripts previously owned by the College for the Scientific Study of Jewish Culture, a rabbinical seminary in Berlin that was closed by the Nazis in 1942. The items were thought to have been destroyed during World War II after the Nazis closed the seminary.
1984-06-22	RABBINICAL GROUP MAY TRY TO STOP SALE AT SOTHEBY'S	The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the group that represents Reform rabbis in the United States and Canada, said yesterday that it would go to court in an attempt to prevent the sale Tuesday of 33 Hebrew books and manuscripts at Sotheby's, unless the possessors of the books are publicly shown to have legal title to them. At the annual meeting of the conference, taking place this week in Liberty, N.Y., 500 members voted unanimously on Tuesday for a resolution to ''take all necessary steps to stop this sale until the ownership of these books and manuscripts is clearly established,'' according to Rabbi Joseph Glaser, the executive vice president of the conference. Also yesterday, the New York State Attorney General's office said that it was looking into the legality of the auction in response to concern raised by members of the Jewish community.
1984-06-19	HEBREW BOOKS SALE PROTESTED	-THREE Hebrew books and manuscripts, dating from the 13th to the 19th centuries and thought to have been destroyed by the Nazis in World War II, are scheduled to be auctioned at Sotheby's June 26, although some Jewish groups have questioned the legality of the sale. The books and manuscripts, which include the oldest Hebrew Bible from Prague that is known to exist, belonged to a rabbinical seminary in Berlin that was closed by the Nazis in 1942. How the books survived the war and who has kept them for 40 years remains unknown. Two Jewish groups, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, which was empowered by the United States Military Government in postwar Germany to receive heirless Jewish property, have requested that Sotheby's release the owners' names in order to determine whether the books and manuscripts are held legally. If, for example, the books were ever stolen or confiscated by the Nazi Government of Germany, their present ownership might be deemed illegal. Both Jewish organizations have asked for full disclosure of the chain of ownership of the property.
1984-06-10	Bolivia Seeks Diaries	The Bolivian Government has won a temporary injunction against the sale of the diaries of the late Cuban guerrilla Ernesto (Che) Guevara, arguing that the diaries are Bolivian property, The Times of London said Saturday. The newspaper said Bolivia won the injunction Friday, preventing Sotheby's auctioneers from selling the papers, which Bolivia said were found on Guevara and his men and taken by the Government.
1984-05-16	1892 GAUGUIN IS SOLD	Paul Gauguin's ''Mata Mua,'' a rare 1892 scene from the artist's first trip to the South Pacific, was purchased last night at auction by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a Swiss industrialist and art collector. ''Mata Mua,'' which shows Tahitians worshiping the goddess of fertility, was the most important painting in a sale of 100 Impressionist and modern art works at Sotheby's, York Avenue at 72d Street. The Gauguin, also known as ''Olden Times,'' was from one of several relatively unknown art collections formed before World War II that had stimulated intense interest in the sale. It was the most important work from a collection of 12 Impressionist and modern Post-Impressionist paintings and drawings acquired by Julius Wolf. Wolf was a German-born cotton trader who became a Swiss citizen and moved to New York in 1940 with his wife, Erna Levi Wolf. After Wolf's death in 1944, she married Sylvain Dreyfuss and kept the collection intact. At one point, the art works were at her suite at the Lombardy Hotel. She died last year.
1984-05-10	DIAGHILEV MEMORABILIA IS SOLD FOR $1.1 MILLION	The former dancer Serge Lifar, a protege of Diaghilev and the last of the premiers danseurs of the Ballets Russes, today sold at auction his collection of original manuscripts, paintings, notebooks and correspondence from the Diaghilev era. The bulk of the collection, sold by Sotheby's for prices totaling more than $1,150,000, had been the personal property of Serge Diaghilev which Mr. Lifar, now 79 years old, acquired at the death of the legendary ballet master and progenitor of modern ballet forms. Mr. Lifar was at Diaghilev's bedside when he died in Venice in 1929. Among its treasures were contributions by many of this century's greatest artists to ballets created by Diaghilev between 1909 and the time of his death. The collection included an array of works by such artists as Picasso, Miro, Debussy, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Ravel and Cocteau for aspects of ballet production ranging from sets and costume design to scores.
1984-05-04	AUCTIONS	THERE'S a monumental Henry Moore on the sidewalk at Sotheby's and two Alexander Calders on its roof - all part of the auction house's exhibition of art works that it will sell over the next two weeks. Moore's bronze ''Reclining Figure,'' executed in the late 1960's, was shipped in by helicopter and flatbed truck Monday from somewhere in the New York area (the site and the collector have not been disclosed) to the galleries, York Avenue at 72d Street. Then, because of the sculpture's size and weight - it's more than 11 feet long and 8 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds - David J. Nash, Sotheby's director of fine arts, decided it should remain out front until it is auctioned May 15. Mr. Nash had Sotheby's carpenters build a wedge-shape base so that the figure is level on the sloping sidewalk. ''I just hope someone buys it and takes it away,'' Mr. Nash commented, adding that to do so may cost a buyer about $500,000. ''I would have liked to put Calder's 'Big Crinkly,' on the street, too, but it might have proved hazardous swinging in the wind. Anyway, we have a wonderful acre of flat surface on the roof, where it will be quite safe.''
1984-03-28	Record $1,185,800 Paid For a Balthus Painting	Balthus's 1957 ''Stepping out of the Bath'' brought an auction record price of $1,185,800 yesterday at Sotheby's in London when it was sold to an unidentified collector bidding over the telephone.
1984-03-25	ART NOUVEAU AUCTION BRINGS U.S. $1.5 MILLION	The deficit of the Federal Government was reduced by about $1.5 million yesterday at Sotheby's sale of Tiffany lamps and other Art Nouveau objects assembled in the late 1970's by Barry W. Toombs, a convicted drug smuggler. The all-day auction of the collection, which was seized two years ago by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, included 273 offerings, the proceeds from which will go to the United States Treasury. Sales totaled $1.7 million, more than $700,000 above Sotheby's most optimistic expectations. Out of that total will come Sotheby's percentage, which was not disclosed, and the costs of the sale.
1984-03-21	70 OLD-MASTER DRAWINGS TO BE SOLD	Seventy drawings from the Chatsworth Collection, reputed to be the finest private collection of old-master drawings in the world, will be sold at auction this summer in London. Representatives of Christie's, the auction house handling the sale, said it will be the most important auction of old-master drawings in nearly half a century, and will include works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt, Rubens and Van Dyck. Art experts predict that the 70 drawings - just part of 2,000 in the collection - should sell for a total of $10 million. An attempt by the British Museum to purchase the drawings failed when agents of the Duke of Devonshire, owner of the Chatsworth Collection, rejected an offer that highly placed sources said amounted to more than $7 million. The only previous sale of drawings from the collection, which the second Duke of Devonshire amassed more than 250 years ago, was to the British Museum in 1957.
1984-03-14	TURNER PAINTING TO BE AUCTIONED	A late, experimental painting by J. M. W. Turner, ''Seascape Folkestone,'' is the most important art work from the $6 million collection of the late British art historian Kenneth Clark that will be sold by Sotheby's in London in June. The Turner was painted in Kent around 1845.
1984-02-15	6 BALTHUS WORKS HIGHLIGHT COLLECTION AT AUCTION	Six works by Balthus, the contemporary French artist, are among the highlights of a $3 million collection of Surrealist and post-World War II art that will be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on March 27 and 28. The announcement, made by the auction house yesterday in New York, comes two weeks before the Feb. 29 opening of ''Balthus: A Retrospective'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the first extensive survey of his work to be held in this country. The exhibition will remain through May 13.
1984-02-02	WRIGHTSMANS' FURNITURE COLLECTION AND PALM BEACH MANSION TO BE SOLD	PALM BEACH, Fla. AFTER 37 winters here, Charles and Jayne Wrightsman are selling their 28- room surfside mansion and its furnishings and leaving this sunny enclave of the privileged. The Wrightsmans are asking $12 million for the sprawling, red-roofed, white stucco dwelling, which is framed by tall palms, manicured hedges and gardens abundant with flowers. The price is one of the highest sought for a house in this resort.
1983-12-23	DONATELLO SALE DUE IN MARCH; Donatello sale due in March.	AN extremely rare painted terra-cotta relief of the Virgin and Child by Donatello will be auctioned by Sotheby's in early March and is expected to bring as much as $1 million. The work, which was out of public view for decades, turned up three years ago in the home of Francis Michael Cryan, a retired New York stockbroker, in Boca Raton, Fla. The mid-15th-century work, modeled in half-relief, depicts a noble Mary, with a bittersweet expression, her eyes lowered in thought, her aristocratic hands holding a swaddled child with a compelling gaze, puffy cheeks and a protruding lower lip. The Donatello came to light when Mr. Cryan became curious about the work and got in touch with Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Hoving, who is now editor in chief of Connoisseur, referred him to Sotheby's, and Mr. Cryan sent photographs to the auction house.
1942-08-12	CHAUCER MANUSCRIPT AUCTIONS FOR u2,250; Trollope Letter, Fearing Wife May Die, Proposes to Another	"LONDON, Aug. 11 -- An illuminated manuscript of Chaucer's ""Troilus and Criseyde,"" done on vellum for Henry V when he was Prince of Wales, brought 2,250 at today's sale at Sotheby's."
