2008-03-30	What Is the Car of the Decade?	TESLA MOTORS, the nascent dot-car manufacturer that promised the world an electric sports car, has announced that series production of the Tesla Roadster had begun at the Lotus plant in Hethel, England. The Roadster is powered by a 185 kilowatt (248 horsepower) electric motor and promises to be the only mass-production electric car offered in America. If Tesla overcomes the many hurdles of bringing a high-tech, alt-energy, niche-market car to profitable production, it'll certainly be remembered as one of the signature cars of the decade.
2008-03-30	Tata Motors Lands Jaguar	ON Wednesday, the Ford Motor Company agreed to sell Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors of India. Tata will pay Ford $2.3 billion -- or $200 million less than Ford paid for Jaguar alone in 1989 -- while Ford will contribute $600 million for the Jaguar-Land Rover pension fund. While it may seem a bit late for hand-wringing over the end of the British Empire, the sale of Jaguar to an Indian company must be even more jarring to lovers of classic English brands than the sale of Bentley and Rolls-Royce to the Germans. But any change for Jaguar must be seen as a positive one.

2006-09-24	The Enlightened Gearhead	It's hard to know what to believe about the car of the future. Will we be forced to trade horsepower for solar power? Will wanting to drive a solid, comfortably appointed car that zips along the highway brand you as someone who is blithely hastening the planet's demise? Will we have to drive tiny electric pods that are energy-efficient -- but so cramped on the inside, and in need of recharging so often, that Americans' love affair with the road will become a thing of the past? The blanket answer to all these questions is that things may not be as dire as they seem. The internal-combustion engine isn't headed for extinction anytime soon, but that doesn't mean that some car-company engineers aren't trying to make it greener, creating a turbo engine that promises more power, but with lower fuel consumption and emissions, than its conventional counterpart. And in Silicon Valley, a young company has developed a sleek, high-performance electric sports car that its creators say is more fuel efficient than the hybrids now on the market while boasting acceleration that gives the Porsche a run for its money.
